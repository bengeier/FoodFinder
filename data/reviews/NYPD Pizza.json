{"text":"It was so hot on the day I went to this place, they were baking the pizzas on the roof! hehe!  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the pizza, pretty damm good. I have 2 slices and one of Sicilian; all were just like NYC. The service was good too, unlike in NYC. :)"}
{"text":"Met up here  with some friends who were in town visiting. Upon arrival the host dropped us off at a table right next to the soda machine, in the middle of the hallway. We must of showed our discomfort for this seating pretty vividly,as a gentleman quickly came over  and  insisted we'd be more comfortable if moved to a \"luxury sky box\" upstairs. We had a good laugh and we're lead to some upstairs tables  which was a 100x better seating option. (They really shouldnt seat people in the soda hallway until they have too).The meal itself was very  enjoyable, pizzas came out perfect , and the staff was very friendly, server was lots of fun."}
{"text":"This NY style pizza is about as authentic as going to North Dakota for Mexican Food. All it does is leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. For those of you who like it.... Sorry you need to get out more! (Maybe North Dakota for Mexican) Anyway I'm not going to say this place or that place is better, just not my taste... By the way location is great and staff is nice, and that is always half the battle!"}
{"text":"Went back for a quick dinner, had an amazing time. Zach was working and made the experience very pleasant. Again, food was delicious and prepared in a timely manner considering the time of day and how busy they were."}
{"text":"The Brooklyn Family pizza is spectacular. Otherwise it's just pretty good. Service was a little slow and waitress was also just fine.  I'd go back for that Brooklyn though!"}
{"text":"Now this is a cool joint! Subway tiles, NY signs, plaid table covers,and swingin old music! The food is delicious! From the salads to the thin slice pizza it does not dissapoint! The staff was young but super attentive.  We wish we had a place like this in California."}
{"text":"Hats off to NYPD Pizza. The crust is really good and I'm told it is because of the highly filtered and treated water they use to make the dough. Instant hit with the kids. If you are in the mood for pizza, definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"I have been to this nypd a number of times and have always had the best service and the best food one can expect. I own a restaurant in downtown Phoenix and I am from New York and let me tell you this place lives up to my expectations of how food and service should be. My waitress is usually the wonderful ms Jackee Webb, but I must say that everybody in there is very polite, helpful and knowledgeable. I am a little specific with my order I like a little extra of this... a little more of that and they always get my order 100% correct every time (even though I know as a restaurant owner, I'm probably a little bit annoying) they always take the best care of me and my guests. Thank you guys for doing the great job you do and making me feel like I'm at home every time!!"}
{"text":"We used to order from NYPD quite often, but this place has gone straight downhill in the last few years.  We called for pick-up tonight and were put on hold. No problem, it's dinnertime and they're busy. Someone comes on the line and asks if we're ordering pickup or delivery. We tell them... and get put on hold again. Okay.  The guy taking our order seemed totally clueless - probably another new high schooler they hired. He required long pauses between each item of our huge order of 3 dishes and 2 sides. Not terribly difficult, we thought.  When we arrived, they tried to tell us that the olive oil that goes on their pasta is plain. Um, seriously? I'm paying for plain olive oil on my plain pasta? I can do that myself! I know for a fact they usually season their olive oil, as do ALL decent Italian restaurants. The fact that I had to argue with them about it was ridiculous. We had to ASK for some garlic and seasoning to be mixed in for us. Thanks.  Next, we specifically ordered garlic CHEESE knots - confirmed two times over the phone - only to arrive home and discover we had plain garlic knots. If we'd known, we would've saved the money and just had the ones that came with the entrees. Most upsetting was the fact that we were, indeed, charged for the CHEESE knots, not the plain ones. How complex IS this?  Finally, we had to actually request a side of sauce for our cheesecake, when this was never explained over the phone. Funny, since the website menu specifically states the dessert comes with raspberry topping. If there were options, maybe we should have been informed when ordering. If we hadn't caught the mistake, we would've left with... a slice of plain cheesecake. Fantastic. For nearly 5 bucks? I can get two slices for half that at Walmart, strawberry swirl included.  All this for overpriced, bland food, an enormous wait time, an incompetent staff, and one huge headache. The pizza is good, sure, but the hassle is NOT worth it anymore. If this is how they run the show now, then I'll take my business somewhere tastier and cheaper."}
{"text":"Definitely was not NY style pizza, but it was so good, I didn't even care.  The ingredients were super fresh (we loaded it with peppers, sausage, onions, pepperoni, and I don't even remember what else).  Crust was fresh and fluffy, in a good way.   Service was nice and friendly, although not as attentive as my group of 5 would have liked.  One person at our table actually got up to refill out drinks herself when our cups had been empty for at least 15 minutes -- the place wasn't even half-filled, so not sure what happened there.  The pizza definitely made up for that lack.   Relaxed vibe, there was another group like ours, a middle-aged couple on a date, and a family, so a great mix of people."}
{"text":"sux, prices suck, food sux , attached photo, service sux, had to have the manager just to here what the prices where after a lame dispute on how over priced a small pizza and dinner salad was, stay away!!!"}
{"text":"LOVED this place!  We came to Phoenix for a concert and stopped here for dinner before the show.  I wasn't sure about it because I couldn't find many reviews on it.  I have never written a review before but this place deserves to be known about!         I ordered the small calzone.  It was fantastic!  The ricotta was so delicious.  I love that they have a small version.  We ordered the garlic knots as a starter and those were soooo good!  My friend ordered a My'za (8in personal) bruschetta pizza and a salad.   Best pizza ever!   Crust was buttery and cooked perfect.  Our daughters ordered a my'za pizza to share but filled up on the garlic knots. We all ended up taking some with us for breakfast the next day because we didn't want to get too full before the show.  It was just as good warmed up in the hotel microwave.        We decided to come back the next night to\"pig out\" since we had no plans afterwords.  The food was delicious!  And our waitress Christine was awesome both nights.  Very fast,  friendly,  and she remembered that we had gone to a concert.   She asked our daughters about it and made them feel special.  Several other staff members came and asked how everything was during our meal as well.       We ordered pizza and calzones again with different toppings and it was just as delicious.  We also ordered the fried mozzarela which is served with balsamic vinegar and marinara.  SKIP the marinara!  Dipping that cheese into the vinegar was something I would never have thought but OMG, it's delicious. We also ordered the San Gennaro zeppolis for dessert.    Safe to say that we waddled out of there.  I will definetly visit this place every time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Nice to see them back in Surprise, Arizona. Went there last night, Anna and the other young ladies were very friendly. Pizza was great, customer service was fantastic. Great staff and food. Bar tender was very friendly and attentive. Thank you for such a great experience. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place has really good pizza and wings but our waitress was so rude. She was a redhead and we asked for ranch 3 times just to be ignored and every time we ordered something she looked annoyed. We had to get up and walk to the cashier and ask for ranch ourselves. I would've rated 5 stars if it weren't for the customer service."}
{"text":"NYPD Pizza on Camelback is a bit out if my way but the Roast Beef sub is to die for! One of my clients brought me one of the subs. Now I go out of my way to order the number 3 on the menu. It's a roast beef sub and it's amazing! The service is  great, the place is clean and the staff is friendly :)"}
{"text":"So first the lady on the phone read my order back completely wrong. I corrected her twice and when I arrived in 30 min to pick them up I had to wait another 10. The order was still in correct and nothing was offered in return. I love NYPD but not this one and I advise to go to another location."}
{"text":"We visit your restaurant at least once a week.  The staff are wonderful, well trained and provide exceptional service.  We would love it if you could expand your beverage offering to say bringing in ginger beer to make a basic mule (We have requested this at the restaurant several times, yet to no avail).  Look forward to continuing our patronage!"}
{"text":"Great place for family night and the best pizza place in the West Valley. Great service. Quality food."}
{"text":"excellent pizza and great environment. New York style pizza and huge! No complaints and will eat here again"}
{"text":"Good pizza, lot's of seating space. Our lunch took forever to make and there really wasn't many people there at all. I go to the Chandler location quite often and they are fast and really nice there. I didn't get the same service here but oh well, at least the food was just as good,"}
{"text":"I've gone through 4 of the lunch cards, and I'm still not sick of this pizza! It's always good, never had a bad slice. Sometimes at lunch everyone from the Bank of America campus across the street will swarm the place, then it takes forever other then that it's really quick."}
{"text":"I have a 2 year old daughter. Going out to dinner, especially a new place, is always an adventure. This restaurant provides great service. Firstly, Anthony, greeted us at the door, and were promptly seated. Within minutes, my daughter had a coloring book, crayons and an apple juice. All was calm. Steven served us. Steven made excellent recommendations, and he brought my daughter's order within minutes of us ordering it. The pizza was excellent. The beer was excellent. The service was excellent. The price was very fair. I will certainly go back."}
{"text":"My staff and I come here at least once a wk for lunch. Tiffany always greets us with a smile and like she's known us for decades. She's so friendly and attentive. Pizza by the slice is always good - I get mine extra crispy."}
{"text":"The meat lovers pizza is a solid choice; fairly topped and not too greasy.  But what I LOVE at this place are the Hell's Kitchen Buffalo Wings.  These things are NO JOKE and you need to be able to handle some serious heat if you're going to try these things.  These are burn-your-lips-off deliciousness!  I subconsciously breathed through my mouth in an attempt to cool it down and my dragon fire breath burned my husband's eyes.  Try them... if you can handle it!"}
{"text":"My family are new to AZ and wanted to check this place out. Place was not busy when we walked in. We were greeted and seated right away. Waitress came over and we placed our order. For appetizers we orders what we thought were mozzarella sticks, but instead were mozzarella squares. Regardless they were still very good. We also had a pitcher of beer and when we got our bill had a $4 discount for the time of day we came in, so that was nice to see.  The pizza was really tasty and definitely tasted like fresh ingredients. They have a small bar area which is pretty cool to catch a game, but they had a diamond back game, so I'll have to look for a place to watch my Dodgers :)  This was still a good place and will be back."}
{"text":"Met a group of friends for lunch at this particular NYPD location.  I've been to their Chandler restaurant a few times, but now that I've visited this one - gotta admit - I kinda like this one better.  Staff was very friendly and professional. Prices are always good.  They have a kids eat free night (Wednesday?) which impressed me, as well as a nice kids menu.  Restaurant was clean, bathrooms were clean and overall, it's a nice place."}
{"text":"I love it! it has the best pizza for the price. The best place to eat Pizza blanca white pie."}
{"text":"NYPD Pizzeria tried to refuse service to me and my certified service dog.  when I reported it to the owner, all they wanted to know was \"which location\" and \"who\" what I asked for as a remedy was that they include this in corporate training and have a service dog/handler pair come speak about this law at annual training.  They totally disregarded my communication because I would not \"name\" the persons involved.   my perspective was that, in this economy, people didn't need to lose jobs.  But obviously, education is needed.  I have now turned this case over to the ADA for action and will most likely get an attorney to FORCE them to educate their staff about people with disabilities and Aids, whether that be equipment or a service animal.  Do not support this place.  There are plenty of pizzerias who don't have this attitude that need your business in this economy."}
{"text":"This is a basic pizza place but it's horrible with timing. For delivery they ask for 75 min to expect the delivery; however, 95 minutes we get our pizza and it's cold!"}
{"text":"First time here. Our server Hector was in training but I have to say the service was flawless! Large servings, cold beer, immediate seating. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza, nice thin, foldable!   Slices are cut large like a typical NY pizza.   Their garlic knots and salads are good also.   Chelsea chopped salad is one of our favorite salads.  Great pizza chain."}
{"text":"This place is so good that I am eating here for the second day in a row. Their calzone is fantastic. They have excellent happy hour deals on different menu items. There are always many patrons eating in, though because the restaurant is large there is rarely a line. We had a slight discrepancy with our bill, but the situation was quickly rectified. I could eat at this place every day!"}
{"text":"Great service, and the pizza is pretty decent. I felt like I was a 'regular' in there, the waitresses were very friendly and welcoming. I would go back again in a heartbeat, good stuff."}
{"text":"Love this place specifically for their cicillian pizza. I love that you can take out or eat in and it feels like a fancy restaurant.  Good service.  And not too expensive.  Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"As a native New Yorker this place is alright. Chicken wings 2 stars. Pizza 4 stars. We always get delivery and that has worked out nicely! They did forget chicken in my salad last order but whatever. Was a good little salad.  The food is a little pricey. However you get a lot of food! And it's better than most crappy pizza places around here (except Sals) so I don't mind paying more for a good pizza."}
{"text":"We loved the pizzas.  Lots of topping, great crust.  Nothing oily, great flavors and textures.  Caroline, our server was great.  Manager saw we were obviously ordering for leftover pizza and asked if we wanted part of it at the table and some kept warm in a box in the back.  That was a welcome suggestion.  We were given a free piece of limoncello cake to take home after I said I wanted some but would have to come back another time because I ate more pizza than I had planned.  We'll be back anyway.  Free parking in structure behind after 6pm.  Orbit stop and light rail are very convenient too."}
{"text":"Really good pizza with a touch of New York decor.  Lively place (was completely packed for Friday lunch).  This is definitely not your typical take-out pizza, and I'd certainly call it a step above many similar businesses.  Great for a quick meal or business lunch.  The only negative thing I have to say is that they over-charged for what I ordered and then forgot part of my meal.  They were, however, apologetic and corrected their error as soon as I pointed it out.  If you're taking a group of people, probably best to keep it around 6 max as they don't have tons of large tables."}
{"text":"Consistently great pizza, good service and friendly staff. Wish they had a larger variety of beer on tap, but the pizza is amazing! :)"}
{"text":"Recommended for casual lunches or dinners. Our favorite pizzas are the Big Kahuna and Da Works. Since can usually handle one small pizza for both of us, we ask half and half. We add a Greek salad and we get a full delicious dinner."}
{"text":"1 star for the only good thing about this place which is the pizza... everything else sucks   I ordered wings and I got frozen chicken nuggets  ... don't go here unless all you're gonna eat is pizza.."}
{"text":"I would not even give this business a half star. I ordered online and waited over an hour and a half for delivery. When I finally called the delivery service back I was told that the restaurant had talked to me and cancelled my order because they were not taking on line delivery orders at this time. I did not speak to any one at the restaurant. Thanks for keeping a customer waiting....will not return or order ever again."}
{"text":"I remember when NYPD first opened up. I believe their first store was on Shea and Scottsdale. I had just moved here from NY and was looking for an authentic style pizza joint. I found it. And here I am eight years later and I still think it's the best pizza. There have been some others who claim to be the best, but for overall quality, it's right up there. I have to tell you one thing that is very rare about this place....When I first went there eight years ago, I dealt with a representative of the company, I think his name was Kevin. He was the first person I dealt with and I'll never forget him. Want to know why? It was his customer service. I was so ordering a pie and while I was waiting he asked me if I wanted a drink while I was waiting. I was taken back by that. I've never been to a takeout or eat in restaurant where they offered you a drink and didn't expect you to pay for it. Then he offered me a piece of pizza too! JAW DROP.....Ok. I don't know if they still do that, but that struck a chord with me where to this day, I still ask if he works there and that says something about a company. If you can remember great service from eight years ago and the guy is still working there....This company is doing something right. AND BEST OF ALL....IT'S ONE OF THE BEST PIZZA I'VE HAD HERE.   --former NYer!"}
{"text":"Lasagna pizza? Wow, tastes just like lasagna. Highly recommended! Only on lunch slices menu though."}
{"text":"I love their Chelsea Salad, and their spaghetti is awesome."}
{"text":"This use to be our favorite place to get Pizza and wings. I am not sure what happened, I think they got a new cook and the the last couple times we have had the pizza we have been very disappointed. We get Pizza out every Friday night and I will be looking for a new place in the area."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good pizza at a low price and not the cheap little ceasars type ingredients and flavor then this is the place for you! NYPD serves great pizza with just the right amount of seasoning , cheese and sauce . My experience here was average . I was here on a date we ordered pizza and wings. The pizza was fast and hot and delicious . The waiter was polite and courteous for everything. Te wings however did not come on time . We had to wait and eventually ask the waiter where they were. Me and my date ate our fair share of pizza in saving for the wings. Im guessing the staff dis not take me serious since i was only 16. , they believe teens dont deserve the se respect and priority as adults. After expressing my thoughts to the waiter and stating the manager will hear about this and that i wouldnt pay for the wings if it took any longer they took me a little more seriously and the wings came 5-10 minutes afterwards . That service took it away from 5 to 3 stars!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in AZ hands down. My family has been going here for years and wouldn't bye pizza anywhere else. Zippilies are a must buy!"}
{"text":"Can't speak to the whole menu, but the items I have tried rock. The white pizza (blanca) is my favorite and we always get the garlic knots.  I've also had the Joeys Pizza (veggie) .  I didn't see it on the menu last time, but if you ask you can get  a 1/2 order of the knots (6). They have a few decent draught beers and they are always cold. BTW, I disagree with the soggy crust complaint someone else posted, at least on the two listed above that I regularly get."}
{"text":"Heck yes, I will eat this again.  Had delivery of the BBQ chicken pizza last night.  Was told 45 mins to an hour wait.  OK, fine.  It was here in 20 minutes.  Hot, fresh, nice crunchy crust, thinly sliced red onions, nice pieces of chicken and some damn good BBQ sauce.  We are new to the area and this was our first, but certainly not our last, go at this place.  Appreciated the reviews to help us make the decision.  YUM."}
{"text":"Went just after lunch and got seated quickly. Good food and great service from Tawnya."}
{"text":"As a NYC girl I have to say this is the first time I ever ordered from here and had delivery from the Surprise AZ Chain, and this will be the last time I ever order. I ordered baked Ziti and it was so dry and looked like they baked a whole pan of it and then take from the pan and Microwave it to heat it, The Ziti noodles were hard I ordered chicken wings as well I did not get any blue cheese dressing & Celery as I asked for and there Garlic Bread was definetely nuked, it is as hard as a Hardball you can not even chew it. what a waste of money. People who say this place is excellent must not be from NY...Sorry to write such a bad review but it is the truth..."}
{"text":"Good Fast chain of pizza places Not great not anything special but really its hard to find good pizza in the valley still on the hunt.  I don't think a chain place is going to make the cut."}
{"text":"Barbecue pizza was fantastic.. Good service and fast too! The menu was big , staff nice and friendly.. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is really good. The customer service was extraordinary. The young lady working the register Cheyenne was a huge help and exemplified great service! I highly recommend. Great food and great staff."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot in the area! I'm from NJ, so I'm a picky pizza eater. NYPD is the best affordable pizza I've found in Arizona. Their lunch specials are great too- I'm a fan of the spinach and white cheese slice and a ceaser salad. Plus the staff is friendly and welcoming.   I could go for some pizza right about now..."}
{"text":"yummy yum yummy pizza! I have been going here for years. Great place to  sit and gab with the girls around a hot pie and a cold pitcher. Great ambiance and very relaxed. Great pizza and desert!!"}
{"text":"I've never posted a Yelp review, but I need to post one for NYPD. I know this is specific to the Market street location but I want it to be understood that this applies to all NYPD locations, plus the corporate office.  I'll start off by saying that for most of my life I've disliked pepperoni on my pizza. I know, that's heretical. My wife is also not a big pizza fan in general. She'll eat it every once in a while, but not too often. After moving to AZ three years ago we were introduced to NYPD when my wife's bro-in-law ordered some for some get together. He got double pepperoni and I didn't want to be rude by taking all my toppings off so I just ate it. Holy cow! I didn't know pepperoni pizza tasted like this! Amazing.  To shorten this up, my wife would eat here once a week if she could. I would eat here every day if I could. Heck, I even eat the chicken wings with the hell's sauce, and I hate chicken. The wife raves about the fried zucchini. In short, everything we've tried is good. Oh, the kids love the garlic cheesy knots. My three year old eats the pizza! I need to put in a plug about the service and corporate culture of NYPD. Not long ago our son was in the hospital and it was tough sledding for him and us. One night we were sick of hospital food and we needed a sense of normalcy so we ordered some NYPD delivered. It was so nice to have some true comfort food. I tweeted to NYPD to let them know how nice it was to have their pizza. Next thing I know I'm being contacted by a store manager, asking about our son and showing genuine concern. The next day the assistant director of operations called me to see how things were going. He insisted on sending another pizza our way and when it came it included a card for my son, signed by all the workers in the store. Incredible! So, the fact that the pizza is amazing just happens to be the icing on the cake. The company itself is fantastic and it truly is a family atmosphere. NYPD, thank you!"}
{"text":"Me and my coworkers had lunch today   it took  30min to get our food a simple salad, 2slices and some wings we had  to ask to take our food to go because our lunch break was over. We went to the front to ask our server she was really nice about it BUT IT SEEMS THAT SOME OF THE KITCHEN STAFF GOT UPSET, ABOUT IT   BECAUSE ONE OF MY CO-WORKERS TOLD ME  THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT US. It was only 3 ppl at the bar drinking and only 4 of us eating maybe next time the kitchen staff needs to be a lil bit faster and keep your comments to your self. Food was really GOOD!! BUT KITCHEN SLOW"}
{"text":"Best pizza,  awesome staff and quick service! Great lunch stop too, you can get a slice and salad to go in under 5 minutes! Delish!"}
{"text":"Jess was our driver last night and she was very friendly and made us feel important, she was even joking with our kids, they thought she was the best. And they said she needs to bring our pizzas everytime. The food was brought to us hot and fresh. We have always enjoyed Nypd pizza but last night it became our favorite. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today.  Fantastic!  As soon as came through the door, the hostess (I think her name is Kaitlin) greeted me like I was about to hand her the winning lottery check.  Super friendly and helpful.  She took my to-go order and asked if I was waiting there for it which I was.  She handed me a soft drink cup and said I can't wait thirsty. Kudos.  She even checked the pizza in front of me to make sure it was right.  The pizza itself (four-cheese) was about the best thin crust I've had in Arizona.  Nice pizzeria style with a great crust.  I may not be for everyone, but I personally love that style.  Four cheeses give it a nice flavor.  They have a lot of vegetarian options.  I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My son and I were looking for a pizza place to try and we found NYPD. We found the place to be like an old school Pizzeria, the place looked and smelled awesome. After we were seated I told the server this was our first time, and asked for her recommendations. She told us her favorite was the Wall Street and that's what we got. It was delicious! The pieces were cut big so you could fold them in half and even though we tried, we could only eat half of it. The service was awesome as she checked on us several times, and told us the garlic knots were on the house since it was our first visit. I couldn't be happier with the place and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So disappointed to order over the phone for a delivery and they went to the wrong hotel.   Ordered the Brooklyn pizza and two salads and Ashley who took the order did not write down the right address and delivery person went to the wrong location. The manager got on the line and attempted to retake my order to other store yet by that time it was too late and credited me the charge. Please listen to the customers request and question to make sure you deliver to the right area"}
{"text":"What has happened to this place??  New management?  I came on here to see if there are any other disappointed customers recently.  My office has ordered from here numerous times for years. We know it takes over an hour for delivery so that is why we call in shortly after they open.  Last time we ordered it took 2.5 hrs for our food. They gave us a 50% discount. We were never gonna order again.  However, I am pregnant and just miss this place!  Today after an hour and a half went by I called to check on order.  \"It was next out for delivery.\"  The girl didn't seem to happy I was checking up on it.  It took  2 hrs this time.  The worse part is it seemed they threw on some cheese and did a quick run to heat back up.  It was awful.  Looks like Streets Of New York it is for now on.  :("}
{"text":"I love pizza and being a vegan it has been challenging, but thanks to this place they have a wonderful pizza called the veganizza. Daiya cheese with sauce and spinach, tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil makes this one of my favorite places to go to for pizza. The salads are pretty good too. I really enjoy this place.   They have buy one get one free (pizza)on Mondays and Tuesday and Wednesdays kids eat free !  Staff is very friendly too !!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I swung by tonight for a fast dinner. I'd been hearing great things about it for so long and was very interested in checking it out, being new to Arizona and all.  Pros: Creative, relaxed, and festive atmosphere. Fun music, nothing overwhelming. Just how I like my restaurants. Not too busy around dinner. Our service was EXCEPTIONAL. Lindsay was charming, patient, and informative. Multiple servers stopped by our table to check on us. When my husband expressed his disappointment, our server gave us a free dessert for zappolis--MMMMMMM!  Cons: Garlic Knots weren't garlicky or cheesy or buttery or salty or anything. Perhaps they were knotty? Barbecue chicken pizza was ok--super hot in some places and lukewarm in others, with fresh shredded cilantro and bland chicken pieces. The sicilian pizza crust is flavorful, but tough.  Summary: We'd like to give it another shot. Perhaps we just need to get another type of pizza. The others looked deeelicious, and I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"This place rocks I did have a lower rating but they took care of the issue and delivered an amazing pizza!!  Will be back."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong here, great NY style pizza even friends from NY say it is just like NY style pizza, service is ok, but pizza makes up for it."}
{"text":"Okay this is the second time that I've been to New York Pizza Department and I have to say they got it right this time. Excellent flavor, plus they made it to order excellent crust and we really liked it. I would highly recommend this pizza parlor. I had some issues the first time but the management made it right with no stress or hassles thank you Josh and Angle."}
{"text":"Excellent!  We are long time patrons of NYPD Pizza and recently visited again to find a beautifully remodeled restaurant.  It's casual, yet elegant.  The customer service was fantastic - from the hostess to the waitress and the food was terrific.  I couldn't have been more pleased with how everything looked and the entire dining experience.  We will definitely remain loyal patrons.  Nice job NYPD!"}
{"text":"Came in to NYPD Pizza a few days back. despite having a prior bad customer service experience, my husband and I decided to give it another chance. We have never had issues with the food, it has always been up to par, but because of our mistreatment we decided not to come back. To my surprise we had a great dinner and excellent service. Our waitress, Cindy (or maybe Sydney), was very attentive and had a great demeanor. After our meal we told her of our previous bad experience and she took the time to not only listen but also apologize, and she seemed like she genuinely cared about what we had to say. She more than made up for our bad experience. We will definitely be coming back again! Not to mention the food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Freakin' love this place. Even tho I've never actually been in the place, I order from them all the time. Quick delivery. Decent prices. And DELICIOUS food. You HAVE to try the garlic knots. Girls who take your orders are always very nice."}
{"text":"My family and I went in to NYPD on a Thursday afternoon. Not many people occupied the tables, so were were seated quickly. The hostess was gracious as she handed us our menus. We hadn't been sitting long when our waitress came to order drinks. She was courteous and patient as we asked her opinion on different pizzas. We decided on the sausage, pineapple, and onion pizza and honey barbeque wings. Within 20 minutes, our food was brought out. The pizza was fantastic, however the wings.... the wings were a different story. They were dry and tasteless, with not enough sauce. Deemed a waste of money, the wings were left on the table as we left. Overall, service was good, pizza was good, but wings won't be tried again."}
{"text":"Great white pizza!  Try it with the balsamic reduction its to die for!  The crust is amazing.  Hubby had the chicken parm and for not being hungry he devoured his plate.  We will be back that's for sure. Service was fast and friendly"}
{"text":"Wow, I should've went to the grocery store and bought 20 cloves of garlic instead. My wife, who loves garlic, (and usually uses way too much in her cooking for my taste) couldn't eat the food from this place. Unless you're a fan of poorly executed \"Italian food,\" beware! I've been trying to get the nasty taste out of my mouth for over an hour, to no avail."}
{"text":"The beer was cold and service was excellent! The food was delicious especially the pizza! My first experience was a good one, I definitely will be back for happy hour as the beers are frosty and discounted!"}
{"text":"I've eaten enough NYPD pizza over the years to finance at least one of their stores but those days are drawing to a close.  I'd always thought NYPD made good pizza at a pretty good price, but I've been questioning that position lately and my most recent experience was, I think, the final nail in the coffin.  First of all their prices have increased dramatically, presumably because of Arizona's minimum wage law changes.  I could live with that if the product warranted it but my last takeout order was like eating cardboard with a few ingredients, not much better than Dominoes. I think the problem's simple; there are just too many great (BETTER) pizza joints in the Phoenix metro and NYPD isn't in that class."}
{"text":"Check your bank statements after dining here.  My wife bought her daughter one slice of pizza for $2.95, to go..  She was kind enough to leave a $1 tip.  The next day I am paying bills online and notice a $102.95 charge for NYPD Pizza.  The cashier turned a $1 tip into $100.  So my wife goes to the bank and gets a statement and takes it to the manager, the manager says \"oh we are sorry I will refund the $100, sorry about your luck\"  Now it gets even better.  I check my wife's account that night and see not a refund but another $100 charge from NYPD Pizza????? After many phone calls and three trips, and week later we finally got our $200 back that they stole from my wife's bank account.."}
{"text":"My friend and I came to NYPD for lunch last Tuesday.  It was our first time being there,  I had a slice of the the Buffalo Chicken and one of the Pepperoni and Jalapeno,  He had 2 slices of the Spinach.  First off, these slices are Huge!! I would have been better off only having one slice, but they were so delicious!  They had 80's music playing while we were there and I looved it!! So far, great place, great food, great atmosphere... however, the only reason for not giving it another star, is because upon ordering and paying, they gave me a number to put on the table.  You'd think that would  be so they knew which table to bring the food to, but this wasn't the case.  The lady who brought our pizza out, just stood there, confused, she looked over the dining room, turned back around and went back into the kitchen... then she came back out, looked at all the tables and diners again, then went back to the kitchen still holding our plates.  I could see that she asked someone which table the order belonged to, twice! and when she came back out the third time, she started asking random tables if it was their order, I called to her and asked if they were with the toppings we'd ordered, and she said yes.  The place was busy, but not crazy busy. Perhaps it was just an off day for the server or maybe she was new, but what was the point of giving me the number if they weren't even going to use it?"}
{"text":"First time at this location but all we expected!  Have the bruschetta (order extra bread) because it's so yummy!  Pizza is as good as expected when you know the water is imported from NY.  Zach is an amazing host and McKenna was too-cute-to-miss as our server!  We'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I had the baked ziti and it was delicious. Had enough left for lunch the next day and was amazed it tasted just as good ."}
{"text":"This is the best Pizza and Lasagna around. Hands down. The staff does a good job of preparing your order for in house or to go The pizza crust has that right amount of pull and snap a good slice of pie must have. The marinara sauce is excellent. Ingredients are first class. Nice dining area inside. First class. New York to the dough."}
{"text":"Really, 4 stars? Hmmmm. Me and my wife came in for lunch at 1pm. We were seated and finally got service after 30 min of us drinking our beer. Food finally came after over an hour and this is supposed to be Food In A New York Minute?  Stay away from this place if your looking for a quick lunch. Scratching my head? So I emailed the manager back yesterday after his quick response and still have not heard back."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, but make sure you get a whole pizza.  In other words, if you want their best pizza, don't order it by the slice. I got into the habit of getting a slice or two after I work out at the gym, and the slices were just o.k. That was because they heated up the slices from a pizza they made earlier.  But one weekend, I ordered a large, freshly made pie and what a difference! Some of the best tasting pizza I've ever had!  I've been going to N.Y.P.D. since they opened, and the staff has recently changed (within the last year or so).  The original staff I all knew by name are long gone. They'd throw in a free soda quite often, but after checking with the newer employees, a lot of the original ones were let go for giving out freebies.  Too bad. A little hospitality goes a long way in my opinion."}
{"text":"I love pizza, and I love the Brooklyn here. Sausage and basil are a beautiful combination atop the thin crust, tomato sauce, and mozzarella substrate.   All the pies are excellent actually, monstrous calzones, and salad too. It's not five star because I just don't think they were going for that sort of thing, it certainly won't break your bank with under $7 lunch specials and average priced pizzas.   Possibly better than actual New York pizza, but I'll leave that up for debate."}
{"text":"Great pizza, awesome crust, great toppings and awesome salads here. We make a point of coming here when in town, and love it. They get super busy on weekends thouh, so keep that in mind. Last Friday, there was a line out the door.   Good stuff!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We first discovered it in TN and thought it was only over there. Luckily it's all over the valley, we love it!"}
{"text":"I hate leaving this review because I think this place has great food.  It's the service that kills me.      Wanted to try the Calzone with the wife and were pressed for time.  Waiter said it would be about 15 minutes.  We were the only ones there at 8 pm.  Our Caesar salads took 15 minutes and they were wilted (unusual because again, food is good here).  After waiting much too long we asked to get them to go.  Manager  comes by and says I'm sorry but only one of them got made for some reason.  She comped the one that they made but gave us a bill for the salads.  I don't need freebies but really?  This is the second time this manager has had to comp something for us because of a screw up.  First time I let it go.  Oh I'll still be back for wings and uptown ale sometimes but I'll make sure I have nothing else to do.  Hope you pull it together."}
{"text":"We go to Nypd for a quick and tasty slice about 3 Sunday's a month.  We sit in the bar area so we can take advantage of the great service provided by Allison.  She is professional, attentive and knows how to provide a level of service seldom seen at a local pizza joint."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and service. I was a bit skeptical of the place concerned with how good it would be as I am from out of state, but the service absolutely blew me away. Also, the pizza is truly something special. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the heck out of the place! I normally come here with my parents, they have developed some great rapport with a server named Ashley. She is great! Always takes care of us, is fun, cool and seems like she genuinely cares about us. I enjoy the pizza and Ashley's service always makes it that much better!  I also managed to experience a presentation by the CEO Richard Stark. His enthusiasm for the company and commitment to serving quality products really upped how much I like this place (plus we got a bunch of coupons)."}
{"text":"Eviction notice on the door closes them on July 13 2012. Must have been doing something wrong."}
{"text":"Really good food, I had a large works pizza, it had freshly sliced ingrediants on it, really good, cost around $20 for the pizza but it was huge and was well worth it.  The service was really good. This is definitely my new pizza stop"}
{"text":"Their service is outstanding. I loved the low-key, relaxed lighting and the calm environment wrapped inside of such a hectic city. Their pizza was wonderful. My Mom and I both went back (within 3 days) for another slice of the Lemon-cello Cheesecake with cranberry. Good eats, Great service, Great dessert!"}
{"text":"The food is ok. The parking is one of the worst locations in Phoenix...My coworkers and I decided to find another place to get Pizza at lunch. The parking is never available at lunch. there are 3 Restaurants and 2 small parking lots."}
{"text":"We actually like NYPD and eat here once every few months.  We split the Chelsea salad.  It is very good and we usually order this. My husband ordered the sicilian pizza and the waitress suggested that it be cooked \"crispy\" because sometimes it comes out soggy with so many toppings and thick crust.  Unfortunately, the bottom was burned somewhat.   The service was really good. Our waitress, Kaleigh, was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Pizza is awsome. Crust is delious. They have a wide  variety of pizza.  I get something different each time and I was never disappointed. Wings n garlic bread  are great too. Service is wonderful."}
{"text":"I've been to these places a few times. Food is great. Staff has been friendly. I love this one because the first Tuesday of every month, they donate 20% of the check to M.A.I.N. (Medical animals in need) a place that rescues  animals from the pound/shelter that need medical attention. So five stars in my book."}
{"text":"Our first visit was fun!  We had the delicious sausage/pepperoni with basil (brooklyn family pizza)  Outstanding!   In addition, we had the spinach salad and honey BBQ chicken wings...fantastic.     The staff is wonderful service prompt.  Nice environment/surroundings.    We will be a repeat customer!   Shout out to Torri the manager and Michelle our waiter, They are both exceptional!  and took care of our every need    Thanks,  JayMel"}
{"text":"Here on a business trip and saw the ad in the hotel room.   Pizza was ok at best. A little pricey for average pizza."}
{"text":"Delicious and super cheesy pizza!! They have almost any topping you could ask for and the waiters are on top of things. Fast service and low prices :) very close to true New York pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"heaven!!!!  they have gluten free pizza and it is SOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOD.  once they got there delish pizza i have been there 3 time in 2 weeks.  i am in love.  they also hav ethe best ranch in the world!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. The location, the staff, the bread knots, any pizza or pasta dish you get from here is AMAZING!! Been eating here since it opened. The only improvement I would suggest is to bring back the calamari!!"}
{"text":"Really great food, great service, the Manager even came to our table to welcome us, told us about the food and see how everything went for us. He heard it was our first visit. We will become regulars. Could not ask for more.  Thank-you NYPD Pizza Teresa, Katie, and Quentin"}
{"text":"My favorite place in the valley for Calzones the size of your head! Their water filtration system Ph balances the water to be the same as New York City so the dough rises and tastes great. Finish off with their giant cookie and ice cream and walk away full, fat and sleepy."}
{"text":"This is some really good pizza. I got the Brooklyn pizza. The fresh basil was so good. The service was really exceptional Cody took great care of us. The garlic cheese knots are very tasty yet threw me off when they looked more like rolls. It's was defiantly worth it.  Only one place in Williamsburg  va that I would say was better."}
{"text":"If you read my reviews you will know that I LOVE PIZZA!!!!!  This is one of my favorite pizza places in town.  I just can't complain.  I get the same toppings as I always get:  extra cheese, black olives, mushrooms and artichokes and it's always perfect!  Totally reminds me of getting a slice in NYC.  It's even better cold the next morning!"}
{"text":"Went to NYPD Pizza on 7th Ave and McDowell for lunch - Great food and AWESOME service! Despite on them being super busy I was very impressed the way Lanae helped my friend and I. She is Fantabulous! She gave us such an amazing customer service. Great job Lanae!!!"}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza. Service is always amazing. They could cook some of the specialty pizzas a little longer to cook the center better. Salad is made with good quality greens. We take the whole family, they give the kids crayons and paper plates to color on. They cover a wall with the plates. I thought that that was a cool touch. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza here even though I've been loyal to Ray's down the driveway.   Maybe I like Ray's cheese better?  This place does a nice crust/dough though.  Sauce is good too.  I like \"Fran's  favorite\" which has mushrooms and fresh Roma tomatoes.  Everything here does taste very fresh.  The House salad is way better than most other places as they use Romaine ( I think) lettuce as opposed to non-nutritional Iceberg.  Fresh tasting and I appreciate the fact that I ordered it drizzled very lightly w/ Balsamic dressing and they brought it out w/ just the right amount.  Lunch specials are a great deal!"}
{"text":"I didn't even want to give one star. I don't know what happened to Nypd. I placed my order and they had to call me back to tell me they don't make a certain item anymore. I read it right off there website, they need to update their menu. Nypd use to be my favorite place to get pizza, not anymore. To make matters worse they charged me extra for getting a similar dish and didn't tell me, intern the delivery boy didn't get a big enough tip since I was paying with all the cash I had on me. I felt so bad! Nypd need to clean up their act!"}
{"text":"The place has it all, good appetizers, great draft beer selection, nice atmosphere, and tons of wonderful food choices.    The wife and I eat here weekly and haven't had a bad dish yet.  Sit at the bar and say hello to Melissa for me, she is fantastic.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service is just okay. The food is excellent. The waitresses. That's where the problem is. The server brought our pizza and showed to us. Then walked away with it. The other server then brought it to us."}
{"text":"Best sit down pizza place in AZ. love their sicilian. calzones are great too."}
{"text":"I should have updated this review sooner! After my last experience, I've been many times and every time has been great - pizza is amazing and takeout is simple. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The place could be more clean and staff more hospitable. The area had some smell. Pizza is not great, raw at center. Not returning again."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the person taking the order but I will give them another try.    I ordered 2 pizzas, one pepperoni, one white, and some cannoli's.  The person taking my order had the hardest time and made multiple mistakes.  He had difficulty understanding my address after telling it to him 6 times and spelling it out for him. He failed to write down my first pizza and told me I didn't have enough for delivery until I reminded him about it.  I just knew my order would be screwed up.  Guess what, it was.  About an hour later my pizzas showed up and I got two pepperoni pizzas. After a brief conversation with the manager they took one of the pies back and said the white will be out shortly.  Of course if you like luke warm pizza this would be fine.  We ended up tossing one of the pizzas in the oven for 10 minutes just to get it nice and hot. It's not true NY pizza, but it is still better than the other chains nearby."}
{"text":"See that guy down below, that's going to rate this place one or two stars solely based on the fact that it's a chain restaurant? Same guy that's going to tell you that he is an authority on what true New York Pizza should be, and that this ain't it? Yeah, well...that's me. I'm that guy, only...my first visit here, doesn't give me the fuel I need to tear this place apart. It was good. Really good. What can I say? Sometimes you just have to say, get over yourself and sometimes even chains, come through. I've never been to any of the others, your mileage may vary. (particularly if your also that guy..ehem *cough*lying to yourself* cough)   Half order of Zucchini Sticks ($3.99) perfectly breaded, crunchy, not greasy, served with ranch and marinara.  14\" Brooklyn Family Pizza (Thin Crust Of course) ($16.09) delicious, thin, crisp, just enough give to make it slightly chewy, but firm enough and thin enough to fold in half. Pepperoni, Sausage & Basil if i remember correctly. The Misses said she preferred her sausage in crumbles not sliced like pepperoni, but this is a personal preference. I was good with it.  Tiramisu ($5.99) certainly not the best we've ever had, but more importantly, considering the locale...definitely not the worst.  Pint of Santan Hefeweizen ($4.75) Seriously, If we don't support our local brews and vino, who will? Santan in Chandler makes good brew, and you got to give props to NYPD for showing the love.  Total for Pizza Love for Two: $31.72 I know, I know...its not Dominos pricing, but keep in mind we had an app, dessert, and a pint. Keep it in perspective.  I've seen some complaints about service here, not from me...but then we came at a slow period of the day. Our server Jessica was a bundle of smiles and prompt and courteous.   Bottom line. Believe the hype. Don't be that guy. It's good."}
{"text":"First two times I went it was great. The next time service was so so and pizza was cooked to long. I give them another try. This time the service was very poor and the pizza was burned"}
{"text":"Ordered the Brooklyn Family pizza. Was delicious! My first time ordering here. Would definitely come back and try another one.  Oh, and they finished my order rather quickly. Ordered on a Friday night. Was told it would be 23-35 minutes. Came 5 minutes early, hoping it would be done. And yes it was!"}
{"text":"Much better than I expected, especially since most \"NY Style\" pizza places outside of NY vary widely.  Floppy and fold-able and very tasty.  Also made an excellent cold pizza. On the better cold pizzas I have had actually."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials and super nice young people who work here. The older guy who hangs out in the upstairs office is creepy and always super negative. Stay away from him and you'll have a great time."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the pizzas here. The extra large is 18\" and huge. We tried the salad pizza which I found refreshing and yummy--mixed greens, with feta, sliced almonds, and little diced red onions. The Pizza Blanca, which had garlic, sweet ricotta, mozzarella, and spinach. The sausage and pepperoni was good as well. For dessert, try the mini cannolis--not bad for Arizona :-)"}
{"text":"Came in on a Thursday night and had super good service by Kimberly!!!!! Super sweet with a great attitude. Great pizza too!!!! Will be back."}
{"text":"Good food with good service in a fairly dirty environment.  We sat on the patio and the tables around us had old pizza sauce on them.  Got the plates and they had food on them.   However,  the pizza was very good (we had the Brooklyn) and the garlic knots were delicious.  Would consider going back but I was fairly disappointed with the perceived cleanliness."}
{"text":"Had a problem yesterday with an order. Manager just called to rectify. I dig that he cares, changing my review and adding a few more stars :)"}
{"text":"My need to find a good pizza restuarant stops here.  Excellent service,  friendly people, price is right, Want new york food? Look no more!  We will be back to experience some more of this great menu..  Joey N.  New York"}
{"text":"Love that they offer vegan cheese options for their pizzas.They are conveniently located near me and I go here often. Good staff, and good family atmosphere."}
{"text":"The delivery:      The employee was friendly and helpful.  It was my first time ordering from them, so I needed some advice. They're was a slight issue with getting one of the pizzas wrong. Not a missing topping but the entire wrong ordered pizza.  So it took it down from 5 to 4 stars.    The manager was quick to apologize and handle the issue.  After the offer of a refund or re-delivery. I just opted for the refund.  Now to The pizza!!   It was good  the buffalo chicken that I got on mistake was rather good. Tastefully spicy and tangy. Just like you would expect it to be.   Not overly spicy. Done pretty well.   And the works pizza.   Was very good.  Nice fresh toppings on both. The size of the pizza was well done.  Good crust you can tell someone put some time and care into  making the good.    However pricy makes it hard at a little more than 20.00 a pizza.    Is the largest draw back.  With only specials on like two days a week makes it hard to not order at least once. A week.   All in all.  It is the best pizza I have had in Arizona.. Good job guys"}
{"text":"I've been searching for an arugula and prosciutto pizza like I had in New York a few months ago. And while they did not have the exact thing I've been searching for, they do have the SOHO Salad Pizza, and in a word it was...AMAZING. I asked them to make it without the dressing and just toss the mixed greens in olive oil instead, and I had to hold the nuts because of an allergy, but it was fresh, flavorful and very satisfying. The large is definitely enough to share and was under $10. The staff was super helpful, informative and friendly. This was my first visit, but it will not be my last!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for a casual, delicious meal. The service is always excellent and friendly. The pizza is just the way I like it - thick, chewy crust with a sweet and slightly tangy sauce, with lots of cheese. Garlic cheese knots and baked ziti? YES please! Also, best white pizza in townn! Finally, DO NOT leave without getting the zeppolis with three different sauces - LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Another night of ordering pizza 1 and a half hours ago, and it's still not here. I'm not sure if I should get delivery from here anymore. I ordered at 18:30 (6:30PM) right after my sons soccer practice. Now it's after 20:00(8PM) past his bedtime and we are still waiting. Can the delivery service at this location get it together!?"}
{"text":"There is nothing better than a NYPD pizza when it is cooked properly. I wish I could get one because lately they are over cooked and the crust tastes like cardboard.   I hate paying for an expensive pizza that tastes like cardboard and equally dislike waiting while they cook another one and appearing to be just a picky customer."}
{"text":"Went to this location today for lunch at 12:30 ordered 6piece honey bbq tradional wings and 2 8\" mya pizzas. Wings came out and were delicious. Pizzas came out and I got a different pizza than I ordered. I ordered a Meatball Pizza and got BBQ Chicken.   They offered to make me a meatball and I said that was ok, I like bbq chicken just as much. Then the manager came over and apologized and told me he was going to have a meatball pizza made for me. I told him that it was ok, Ill eat the BBQ Chicken pizza. (For the record I like meatball and bbq chicken pizza equally) He then said he would put it in a togo box and we could take it home. So I caved in and now I get to have pizza for lunch tommorow too. Thank you NYPD for taking care of business. I dont go out to eat often but with great customer service NYPD will keep in the rotation. Pizza came out hot and lots of topping and cheese. (sorry no pics I, wasnt planning on writing a review, it just kinda happened."}
{"text":"Had their awesome lasagna tonight. Working on room to eat the cheesecake desert. Yum."}
{"text":"Usually love NYPD pizza BUT I went for lunch the other day with my boyfriend, I had an iced tea in my hand I didnt see a trash can outside so planned on throwing it out once I got inside. As soon as we walked in the host says \"your going to have to throw that out before I even think of seating you\" haha okay? Planned on doing it anyways. We sat down and server came over, ordered drinks and went to ask a question and she cut me off and says \"hold that till I get back\" again, I laughed it off being a former server myself. We eventually ordered our food and then our server vanished behind the bar flirting with the bartender while I myself got up and refilled my BFs drink 4 times while she watched. Such horrible service. Then she brings us food, and I go to ask for a side of ranch and again cuts me off and says \"okay I'm leaving another server will take care of you, thanks\" and walked away before asking if we needed anything before she left. The new server didn't come over for ten mins so I went up to bar-got a side of ranch-extra cheese-and yet again refilled drinks myself twice more. The new server came over just in time....to drop off our bill. Needless to say I will never be back. Being a server myself I can honesty say everything they did was beyond unacceptable and the worst service I have ever experienced which is a shame because I really do enjoy their food."}
{"text":"We started coming here when we had a couple groupons and now we're here every Friday night for pizza night.   Pizza is great (even better when cooked crispy)! Fried mozzarella and spinach dip are fantastic. And if you have room cheesecake is delicious.   All employees are extremely friendly. Andre is the best there is and has made us regulars.   We'll be going here for years to come!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at this place last night with some buddies. They had told me good things about it, wasn't disappointed.   Not only was the pizza good, the wings were good too.  My server, savannah, recommended that i try the nypd ale.  It was delicious.  Do these guys have anything thats not good???  Food 10/10, beer 10/10, service 10/10, rack 10/10.  Remember in the sandlot when the boys went to the pool and the main reason was because wendy peffercorn was the lifeguard?  Savannah will be your wendy peffercorn."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and they brought back the lemoncillo pie the day we went in. They gave us a free sample. It was amazing. The guy at the bar was so friendly and bus service was so excellent that I wish I could afford to have tipped him more. Very friendly environent. Glad I moved to Chandler. If you want an amazing slice of pizza, make sure you hit up NYPD. PIZZA THAT SERVES AND PROTECTS....your stomach :)"}
{"text":"A clear indication of a great restaurant is not always about the size, but measured but by the quality of the food, the attentiveness of their staff and of course the cleanliness of the place. One adjective comes to mind.....phenomenal. It's nestled at the corner of 7th Ave & McDowell.  It was our first time coming here. Judging by the name I expected walking into every other pizza joint although I was wrong. It has a bistro style atmosphere with marble counter tops at the bar, and open windows so you can see the cooks at work. It's charming with its brick walls and cute art & fantastic happy hour. We had their nypd uptown amber ale, perfect. Their helps kitchens wing. Careful their hot. Ill probably regret it in the morning but worth it. We had their Da Works \"trust us get it crispy\"its perfect. We are definitely coming back, with the trip. If your in the area come see Ami(pronounced Amy) you will be in great hands."}
{"text":"Good pizza and cold beer. and the bartender on the weekends is a smart ass, very fun."}
{"text":"Finally, a pizza place that satisfies the individual pizza taste buds of my family! We ordered the Rocky's Philly Steak Pizza along with a cheese pizza and both were delicious! Everyone left happy."}
{"text":"Great Pizza. Very crowded around lunch hour. But the Pizzas are wroth it. Best Pizza joint in the East Valley for sure."}
{"text":"Ate there yesterday and got food poisoning. Looks like a clean establishment but got really sick hours after eating there"}
{"text":"NYPD delivered food to our hotel for our wedding weekend pool party, and they supplied everything, from the ice and drinks, to food, to utensils and plates. We were so grateful for their awesome customer service. We were fans prior to our catering needs: the food is always fresh, the staff is top notch, and their pizza is a little taste of (East Coast) home for me."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here many times. The calamari is the best we have ever had! I love their Caesar salad and cheese pizza."}
{"text":"We took our four grandkids, ages two to eight, for dinner last night. Not only was the food terrific as usual, our server, Lindsay was absolutely fabulous. She was very patient with all the kids and listened when they asked her a question or wanted to order for themselves. She was very attentive and made our time with the grandkids even more enjoyable. NYPD Pizza at San Tan Village is one of our favorite places. Now when we go, we'll ask for Lindsay!"}
{"text":"I had my daughter's cheer team holiday party there last night and the food and service was wonderful!  I had spoken with the manager several days earlier and asked if tables, etc. could be set up in a certain way and she was very accommodating.  When I arrived to set up everything was like I asked.  The servers were patient and professional.  We had 24 girls and many parents so it was bit chaotic and on top of that, the rest of the restaurant was unusually busy for the evening.  The staff stayed calm and friendly and our food was served in a timely manner.  The kids loved the pizza and salad and the adults enjoyed many dishes off of the main menu.  Overall it was a great experience and we had a wonderful holiday party!  Thank you NYPD!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is amazing! I got half Wall Street and Half Kahuna. Oh my, both flavors were amazing! Then my server, Roger (not sure of the name, but that's what shows on the receipt), gave me cheesecake and strawberries and chocolate syrup, ON the House. Another food to die for. Their cheesecake was perfectly made. Didn't really care for the chocolate syrup, but who can beat a free dessert? All in all, food was amazing and their service was excellent. Would definitely come back when I crave for pizza and cheesecake again"}
{"text":"Update: Added a star for the nice followup email we received from them. --------------------------------- The food was great, once we got it. With a 3 & 5 y/o's with us, my wife and I waited well over 40 minutes to get our complete (simple) order. The server was apologetic but not until 25 or so minutes in when the bread finally came out. It wasn't his fault. We dined in and sat there with another table as to-go order after to-go order came out. We got a free slice of cheesecake for our time. Probably not typical but we won't be going back if that's how diners are prioritized."}
{"text":"Went there on our pizza Friday...the waiter was quick with getting our order. One of the chefs even came out and talked with us for about 5 mins and even got us our drinks..after our water."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I really do like NYPD's food, however I will NEVER return to the Surprise location. We picked up a carry-out order and left a $2 tip on a $12 bill. A few days later we realized they charged us a $200 tip!  When we called the manager, he said he discovered the error and attempted to call us the next day, however we have caller ID and never received a call. Then he proceeded to drag his feet with refunding the money. He even started dodging our calls to the point we actually had to make a trip to the restaurant in order to confront him in-person. Eventually we got the refund, but this incident has cost NYPD two formally loyal patrons. The manager was so unprofessional we decided we would rather take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"The pizza here is always good, especially for those looking for a N.Y. style pizza. The prices are a bit higher than competing family pizza joints, but the overriding complaint is the high volume rock music blasted through low quality speakers. This results in an atmosphere that is the furthest thing from a relaxing, conversation-accomodating dining experience that one would expect. Everyone at our table quickly became annoyed, as we could not hear anyone else try to talk. Adding to this cacophony, the party at the table next to us was really loud, trying to overcome the music to be heard. The three stars are for the good pizzas that the place consistently churns out. Take out would be a better bet than dining in."}
{"text":"Today I experienced the most disrespectful situation. A friend and I sat down at the table and the waitress asked what we wanted to drink. When she came back to ask us what we wanted to order, my friend ordered first. Then when it came down to what I wanted to order I began to ask her a question about an item on the kids menu and she rudely cut me off and said \"can't\" before I could even finish my sentence. I then proceeded to ask why and she rudely said \"you're not a kid\". I only wanted to order off that menu because of the portion size not for any other reason. I then told her I wouldn't be ordering anything and she tried to convince me to order something. We canceled our order and left. I have never felt so disrespected. I will never go back."}
{"text":"I have been to NYPD a few times and have to say that I have no intentions of going back.  My first major issue with it is that their food is extremely over-priced.  I do not mind paying more if it is going to be great quality but I honestly think you do not get what you pay for over there.  I ordered a pizza there and it barely had any sauce or cheese on it and it was extremely undercooked.  It was supposed to be a Margarita pizza but it was disgusting.  The tomatoes were obviously from a can, as they were soggy, and the mozzarella was not even melted because it did not cook long enough!  I also go the egplant parm sandwhich.  It took forever to arrive and when it finally did I was able to tell that it had been sitting aside forever because the bread was increadibly soggy.  Overall it was a bad experience with not that great of food.  The people that work there were nice but the food was disgusting."}
{"text":"You have got to love NYPD in my opinion it is far and away the closest thing in the valley to be sitting in the Bronx..... The bombers were even on the TV for lunch...... And the fact that Josh (mgr) gave me a new T-shirt doesn't hurt..... But seriously if you haven't ever been to an NYPD go... their all great but this one is by far my favorite..... Til next time"}
{"text":"Yummy pizza all the time, i love how their medium is every other pizza places large. Delivery guy was awesome too."}
{"text":"The food is good - I love the Soho Salad Pizza - and the beer is cold.  However, we come back time and again, two young children in tow, for the incredible customer service.  If you have the pleasure of sitting at Tyler's table, you're guaranteed about the best service you could ask for.  The GM, Adam, is almost always there, is extremely attentive, and his positive attitude is clearly contagious.  Every waiter/waitress we've met has been kind and attentive.  Thanks for another great night out, and see you soon!"}
{"text":"Two words: soggy pizza.  Service is the only reason I am giving two stars instead of one."}
{"text":"The pizza was ok. The garlic knots were dinner rolls. The hero sandwich was decent at least it had cappy on it.  But overall a bit disappointed when the service was the best part of the meal. And she was nice.."}
{"text":"My family loves getting pizza from here. Very nice New York style pizza. They have pretty good wings and garlic knots also."}
{"text":"Mexican making pizza ? This place has a very weird atmosphere , staff was awkward and weird. NOT TRUE NEW YORK PIZZA. This is a chain of restaurants so that should say something. This place sucks save your money and go to Ray's pizza or Isa Pizza or even Barrows pizza ."}
{"text":"This is great pizza!  Went for a friend's birthday, and although the service was kinda weird as we tried to get a table.  Once we sat down, the server was very nice.  The Brooklyn Family pizza was so delicious!  And, garlic knots are to die for.  Now I'm hungry again!"}
{"text":"Being from the East coast, I am quite familiar with New York style pizza. I haven't found any comparable to the quality of pizza I am used to in the valley yet and I was told to try here. I was not impressed and it was very expensive for what it was. I'll keep searching."}
{"text":"Most friendliest people and always great service. Never been disappointed with food or service."}

{"text":"Went to NYPD 12/26 with my husband and 3 kids and 2 other families and had a horrible experience.  It started out fine waitress took our drink order then came back for our food order. All of our food came out except for the pizza that was being shared by the 3 husbands.  Well all 6 kids and wives finished their food and the pizza still had not come out.  The waitress told us it was coming out very soon and when we mentioned how long it had been she just smiled and said \"It will be out in 2 minutes\".  I am pretty certain that she knew this was not ok as she began to look frazzled and we watched as the manage walked around the counter area peering in our direction often as to see how we were reacting.  We sat and watched at least 4 groups that came in after us finish their  dinner and leave!!?? Um something is not right with this.  Not once did the waitress apologize to us or make any compensation whatsoever. We also told her that we have 6 kids that are ready to go she told us that their meals came with sundaes and hopefully that will occupy them for a little longer. Now at this point she should have already had those on the table for the kids. When I left the restaurant I personally handed the manager the comment card that had my email address on it and am shocked that I still never received an apology. I understand that mistakes happen (we are pretty sure she forgot to put the pizza order in) but to completely disregard the mistake and not apologize is rude and bad business. My family and I have always enjoyed going to this NYPD and the food is very good but  I will definately be looking for a new family oriented pizza place.  MB"}
{"text":"They aren't great, but they certainly are exceptional. It's just around the corner from where I live so from time to time, usually during football season for mnf, is what I love coming here for if it's just me to lay low and watch the game minus the company you find in a typical sports bar crowd. The food is exceptional and reasonably priced. I'm mostly a beer guy, but here I actually will spring for some wine once in a while. I'm also normally a pizza guy. I mean I really, really like pizza, but here I've gotten pretty much everything else but that, simply because I already know the pizza is good, but so are the other pastas or sandwiches they have, which are slightly cheaper. My favorite so far is their roast beef sandwich. I've always found the waiters to be good and accommodating and I even like the patrons that will come in, which are either families in the dining area or people just sitting at the bar drinking a glass of wine while they wait for their take out order. Never found it to be too crowded, or too loud, or otherwise obnoxious. All of which is why I really like the place. Usually during the course of a game I'll order a pasta or sandwich and a couple beers and the bill will be less than $20 so that's pretty good."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Surprise! Very authentic, friendly staff and fast delivery. You have to give this place a try."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed everything I've had here.  I especially appreciate the range of vegetarian options.  The garlic knots are a family favorite!"}
{"text":"Fabulous pizza and wait staff, including Ami, our server, they were excellent. She made sure, twice, that our pizza was cooked perfectly (I like extra crispy).   My friends and I ate here last night, on a Saturday, and they were overly accommodating.   They have a full bar, good weekend happy hour specials all day, and a nice out-door patio. It was so scrumptious last night I came for lunch today."}
{"text":"Ask for Rocio. She is amazing. I don't cook and frequently go out to eat. Rocio service is better then anywhere I have ever eaten. She goes above and beyond and out of her way to make sure my kids are happy and the food is to our satisfaction. She always has a smile on her face and is friendly.  Rocio thank you, I will be sure to ask for you every time I come in!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a chain Italian restaurant. They make a decent white pie with spinach. If you're ordering takeout be prepared for a longer wait time than they tell you. If you look around online for coupons you can get a pretty good deal for lunch after doing some heavy mall shopping."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Not only that great friendly environment, all of these employees act like family and like they love coming to work. The owner (I think) gives me a hard time when I walk in because I came two days in a row once, and I LOVE IT! It's like I'm home! Lol! The best part is if they make an error they own it, and make it right. This is seriously the best place in town. I won't be getting pizza anywhere else....ever."}
{"text":"Our family really enjoys this place. We go there at least 3 times a month. As soon as we walk in, we get the warmest Welcome by the hostess Mary Anne . The food is amazing and very reasonable. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Moved here from Chicago via St. Louis one year ago. Pizza is one of my favorite meals and St. Louis is not the place for good pizza, HOWEVER, NYPD in Avondale at McDowell and Dysart is AWESOME ! ! ! We were there last night for the first time and definitely will return, OFTEN... our server was Tennille, better known as NeeNee. A girl with a beautiful smile, outstanding attitude, and excellent menu knowledge. She truly made my wife and I feel very welcome.  The food was just GREAT ! ! Simple sausage pizza for me and the Brooklyn Pizza for my wife and we shared and loved both. Also, the Broadway Bruschetta was fantastic for an appetizer. This is a \"Don't Miss\" place."}
{"text":"Although the food here is good the delivery service is horrible.  They get our order wrong 9 times out of 10.  We have to call just about every time.  They offer us a free this or that, but when I order my food I expect to get exactly what I paid for.   I think it's time to find a new pizza place that cares enough to check the orders before heading out the door!! Very disappointed......."}
{"text":"Crispy margherita pizza. Very friendly staff. Way better than Oregano's! Too full to try the dessert but we'll try again next time. I pass 20 pizza places on my way here and never think of stopping. Delicious."}
{"text":"I am updating my older review that was critical of the customer experience, and giving this restaurant four stars. Their food is really good. Great pizza, excellent house salad and good chicken parmesan. Their lunch menu also offers some good deals (I always get the single slice with their house salad). The reason I am giving it more stars is that the managers reached out to me after my critical review and I was impressed with the promptness and sincerity of their response. I do hope the staff becomes a little more attentive to detail; that's my one issue with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Once again.....there's a reason Oreganos always has a wait and NYPD....well not so much. Food was ok. We ordered 2 large pizzas, one Sicilian which was very good and one hand tossed which was dry, hard and burnt. The waitress was very good and attentive. Music in a restaurant is a nice touch, here it was on but couldn't hear it. The waitress did comp the bad pizza which was nice. NYPD just misses the mark. With some tweeks they could be good."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience! Our pizza came out wrong and the manager, with out having to ask, too money off our bill for our troubles! The food was delicious and the service was great!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I come to this restaurant fairly often. Today, Tatum was our server on a pretty busy Friday night. She did amazing and the food was absolutely incredible, like always. We got the medium boneless wings and the Mott street lover's pizza.   The only problem I had, and frankly the only reason I'm leaving this review, is that during the night Tatum got super busy with all of her tables and we just needed some ranch. A man, appearing to be a manager of some kind (we later found out his name is Luke), came up and asked if he could grab us anything. I tell him \"Yeah she just needs some ranch.\" And he looks at my ranch and points and says \"Umm..\" and just kind of waits.. My girlfriend said \"Yeah, that's his. I need one.\" And he just kind of gave us a look and said \"Alright.\"  It just kind of threw us off, like we were making a weird request. I work in a restaurant and if my managers treated a customer like that they wouldn't be there anymore.   Other than his unpleasantness, we had a great night!"}
{"text":"IT WAS REALLY BAD. Store bought  frozen mushrooms. Wings were breaded and fried, not Buffalo style at all. Once the sauce was added, they were just \"not crispy;  The Sauce was not good. Over all, Big waste of money. Go to Buffalo Wild Wings.   Miss Richie running this place."}
{"text":"So the establishment contacted me & asked me to give them another try.  We said, \"Sure, why not?\"  I will have to say that the service was much better this time.  Our server & manager came by many times to check up on us & make sure everything was OK.  The garlic knots were better (less greasy).  The pizza looked better.  It took a little longer than what we were told, but it was not an excessive wait this time.  I still would've liked more toppings & a little less crust.  The desserts were good!  The Cookie 'n Cream was a little too sweet for my liking.  If you've never tried, get the Zeppolis with Raspberry sauce - yummy!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times.  Service has always been great.  At my most recent visit, they were busy, but we were served in a very timely manner.  The pizza was great!!  Really, it was like a masterpiece!  They were generous with the toppings (not too much, not too little) & they were spread out evenly so you enjoy every bite of every slice of your pizza.  It was delicious!!!  Again, service was great, the wait time was not excessive.  This will definitely be a pizza place I will go to regularly!"}
{"text":"I have worked in both the retail and restaurant industry for 15+ years. Both of them are obviously customer service oriented, so I know great customer service when I see it. I have been to several NYPD locations, but this one is by far my favorite. Christina, who is the manager at this location, is amazing! She is all about customer service. To me, that's what is important. People are human, mistakes can be made, but she ALWAYS rights a wrong, regardless of how little the wrong is. My husband and I own a small business, and would be honored to have an employee like Christina working for us. She gives 100% and is as good as it gets when it comes to having a great employee. If you haven't been to this location, please give them a try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"There is nothing like authentic New York pizza, and this is the closet representation to what real New York Pizza tastes like.  Eating a slice of their cheese pizza reminds me of a summer day touring Manhattan.  The customer service was good, not superior, but average. Since it was my brother's birthday, he got a free dessert and he ordered New York's Finest Cookie 'N Cream.....that is to die for!!  It was a large Chocolate Chip Cookie (that was still warm) with two scoops of vanilla ice cream withe chocolate and carmel syrup drizzled over the entire thing.  Yum!! Overall my experience was good and would recommend this place for amazing pizza and a taste of what the big apple is like."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I've always had great service here. The staff is VERY FRIENDLY and I do not have one bad thing to say about this place's service or their regular pies. With that said.....  When I moved from Michigan it was hard for me to find good pizza down here. Papa John's is terrible, Little Cesar's is also terrible - THEN I FOUND NYPD!  I've only tried their regular pizzas and, this past weekend, tried their Sicilian pizza (which is essentially deep dish). BEWARE: the Sicilian pizzas are HUGE! If you've got two or three people to feed - the half size is PLENTY! ALSO BEWARE: the Sicilian is mostly dough, which soaks up all of the sauce and depending on what kind of toppings you have, ends up being very watery because of veggies. I ordered Da Works Sicilian and was VERY disappointed - which surprised me because I LOVE THEIR REGULAR STYLE PIZZAS THEY ARE TO DIE FOR! Anyway, the Sicilian is NOT A DEEP DISH - it's extra dough, under cooked and they didn't even have the courtesy to warn me HOW DOG-GONE BIG IT IS!  Otherwise, their regular pizzas are amazing! Totally worth $20 per pie. My favorite is between Da Works and Big Kahuna - they know how to do a Hawaiian pizza.   I recommend this place to anyone I run into looking for a good pizza joint!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, definitely better than the national delivery chains, but not nearly as good as the top notch pizzeria's we are blessed with. That being said their prices are actually higher than the best places (Grimaldis, Spinatos, Quattro al Formagio, Humble pie, Pomo , Grazi, Bianco, The Cove). So - I recommend NYPD if you are really hungry for Pizza and can't get to one of these other places, or for home delivery - and look for a coupon."}
{"text":"The pizza used to be really good! I don't  know if it's just the delivery but,  it's definitely the worst pizza I have ever had. We ordered crispy and it was floppy and cold :-( . I can't speak for going to the  restaurant but delivery is a no go."}
{"text":"we just had dinner at new york pizza dep we had the best service from ashly!!!!! best service we've had in a long long time"}
{"text":"Wow!! It's a 180 degree turn about here. I haven't been here in over a year because of my last bad experience from rude employees. Today I was treated with friendly smiles and greets of welcome. They must've switched staff on me. These NYPD people were actually glad for the customers coming in. As I waited for my pickup, I observed the friendly staff greet customers walking in, being super polite, helpful and eager to wait on them. I was very impressed!  Nice job NYPD on McDowell + 7th Ave!!"}
{"text":"Food and service are always good here, plenty on the menu to choose from, prices are very reasonable, and Joe does a great job on both sides of the bar.  Always satisfied!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. The small calzone was still as big as a normal one.   Service was sub par . They brought our drinks and then after 10 minutes, the manager came and took our order on a napkin. Never received a refill on my water and when the calzones came out, the server didn't know who's was who's.   Food a hit, service not so much."}
{"text":"Decent food. Pizza was doughy and sticky and we were told by our waitress that our pizza was taken out of the oven prematurely with no attempt to correct it.  Had to ask 3 times for our sides. 2 times for napkins. Was told that the pesto was not dairy free despite ordering it yesterday and it being \"dairy free\" yesterday when we came for dinner. There were 8 employees at the counter doing NOTHING and we were one of two parties of 4 in the entire restaurant. Serious customer service fail."}
{"text":"If you like authentic New York style pizza, NYPD Pizza is the only place to go. It is great and makes me feel I am back in New York. Love it!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and nice guys making it"}
{"text":"NYPD claims to taste like NY pizza because they use \"Yonkers water\" in their dough.  I grew up in Yonkers. My benchmark is Carlo's Pizza at the corner of Central Avenue and Tuckahoe Rd.  That is my neighborhood.  Yonkers wins the NY State water flavor championship on a yearly basis, so to make such a claim piqued my interest.   NYPD is some of the worst pizza I've ever had in my lifetime.    We ordered pizza with tomatoes on top.  When I picked up the pizza and brought it home, I realized that the tomatoes were stale.  Yes they gave me a refund, but anyplace that serves pizza with stale toppings isn't worth my time.  I've never eaten there since.  If you want authentic NY Pizza forget NYPD and go to Ray's at the corner of Pima and Frank Lloyd Right."}
{"text":"This is our first time at this location in Surprise. We were initially seated outside and asked for the heater to be turned on but were told that they ran out of gas. So we waited for a table to open in the dining room and moved.  My family loves pizza and wings so I tagged along and hoped to find something I could make Paleo compliant. I am Paleo because of auto immune disease, not to be difficult.  I struggled here. There are salads and that was my option, but a grilled chicken breast, instead of breaded, would have been great to add to it. So I will leave hungry.   But my husband really enjoys his calzone and mentioned that the cheese is just the perfect balance of salty and sweet. The crust was crisp and hit the spot.  The garlic knots were fun as an appetizer for the kids. They weren't thrilled with wings and packed them to bring home.  So in our estimation, they are better than Streets of New York and Grimaldis, worse than Native New Yorker, and nowhere near the level of Barros. And for pasta, salad, and calzone, Babbo's pours a lot more care into their food."}
{"text":"My wife and I visit Tempe every March for spring training and we always enjoy the Mill Avenue restaurant scene. This trip we have found a new gem of a restaurant - NYPD Pizza! We wanted to grab a quick bite before heading to the Angels game, and the pizza was so delicious that we decided to come back for dinner - and we certainly hit the jackpot! The NY style pizza is fantastic! Plus they have a great selection of pasta entrees. And the desserts!! We ordered the lemon cake, thinking we would share it, two bites into it we ordered a second! They have several big screen TVs - perfect for watching March Madness while we ate! The owners are really nice guys and we enjoyed chatting with them. NYPD Pizza provides a great dining experience - excellent food and ambiance, and friendly team. We recommend this restaurant highly - and we WILL be back!"}
{"text":"If you love great  pizza and you believe good dough and sauce are the foundation  to great pizza..then look no further! I have been hunting for a pizza joint since I moved here three years ago..many have fallen so short and left me bitter, until I found Nypd. They use fresh ingredients and it shows in the flavor of the pizza. I like the thin crust, and I love the variety of table spices that you can add to your pizza..be warned the pizzas do take time to cook, so if your a bit hungry order an appetizer along with your order. This pizza is worth the wait and is phenomenal, I love the crust and order a 16 or a 14 inch pie which is plenty for the next day."}
{"text":"I really like there pizza and garlic knots but delivery takes FOREVER! any day of the week you will wait a minimum hour plus for delivery. And takeout isn't much better."}
{"text":"Great Pizza joint... A little on the pricy side for pizza, but if you catch a lunch special or something its not too bad. Ive been coming to this place for years and its good every time."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Their website states incorrect information and they make it seem like the customer is at fault. The store that would deliver to my home was incorrect on their website and I had to call two locations, one location stated that they were \"closed an hour ago\" when the site stated otherwise. When I spoke to the manager they did not let me speak and said they would hang up the phone on me, which they did. I did or said nothing wrong. There are too many Pizza shops in this town for them to think that they can treat people depending on how they feel. I will never give these people my business and will recommend the same to the people that I know. I have never written a review but this prompted me to because a patron should be treated with respect."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza around! It is a bit spendy but definitely worth it. Our waiter Andre was very friendly and checked up on us often. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Justin helped me out tonight at the bar. Great guy great service. Clean environment. Will come again thanks to Justin."}
{"text":"I've been back to NYPD and ordered delivery several times since my first experience there during their opening week. They have clearly fixed things with their delivery system. The order taker now asks clarifying questions and the driver made it to my house in record time. It was a pleasant experience, making me a happy customer once again. I'm so glad this has worked out because I love NYPD pizza. I've never had a beef with the food. It's always good when I can get it. I'm happy now about that.  Oh, they have a great happy hour with $3 drafts and a pretty good selection. The bartender, Duvell (sp?), is awesome. He's honestly the reason why I went back to give the restaurant another try. I'm glad I did."}
{"text":"We tried them twice, we had pizza delivered, the first time we waited approx an hour and the $40.00 pizzas was wrong, they were nice and they admitted the mistake and said they would send the correct pizza, but I had to wait another hour, no offer of any compensation for their mistake, the pizza was good, but the two hour wait was a bit long. The second time we waited again approx an hour and the pizza was under cooked, a few minutes in the toaster oven and we were able to eat, the taste was different this time, not as good, Overall we gave them two try's and both were disappointing."}
{"text":"Better than pizza hut, but not real deal NY pizza. Crust was undercooked, had to knife and fork it, couldn't do the true NY fold or the slice would have fallen apart."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best restaurants in Phoenix with regard to serving a true New York style pizza.   Friendly staff and relaxing atmosphere.  Manager Brittany handled very professionally a small  faux - pas with my order,  which will keep me coming back.   Fabienne and Justin were particularly great servers."}
{"text":"The best fried calamari in Surprise! Delish pizza! Consistent quality and service, never have been disappointed since we moved here in June!"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and even when they're incredibly busy and over worked the waiters are always pleasant and accommodating. Ask for Jaime. She was the sweetest waitress. The service was great."}
{"text":"Great stop for a good lunch. Easy to get in and out in your lunch hour if you do the express menu. Salad and a slice is great."}
{"text":"Very friendly service and good food.  I ordered the large Al Capone calzone which was huge.  The calzone is made fresh and is baked just right.  Plenty of tomato sauce for dipping too.  If I had to make one critique is that the type of ricotta cheese they use was slightly over seasoned, but that is a personal preference.  Next time in I will try the pizza."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was attentive and Whitney is a service Rock Star.  She makes us feel like one of the family ( we're not just to be clear) every time we come in.  Ask for her when you drop by"}
{"text":"Picked up a delicious pizza to go!  Thought $22 for a medium pepperoni pizza was a little pricey.  Since it was good, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love Liz! She is so good she knows what I order. If she is not there I don't even know what to order because she has spoiled me so much. Liz keeps her hair cut sharp looking and nails always done. Easy on the eyes and can run the place alone. Food is always great and service could not be any better. Liz always has a smile and is happy to help anyone that walks in that door. Like I said Love Liz!!!"}
{"text":"Good service and excellent pizza. It is worth a try. It has a family restaurant type of feel."}
{"text":"Really awesome pizza and wings! The salad was fabulous too. I had the Chelsea chopped salad with Sun dried tomatoes and house dressing and it was fresh and delicious. Matt was a great server and very knowledgable about the menu and ingredients(I have food issue :( )"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I always sit at the bar, so never had service problems. Delicious pizza and spaghetti and meatballs! Their dessert pizza is delicious too!   But...the best part is the triple filtered NYC-style water!:) Especially in the desert ;-)"}
{"text":"My Experience here is always so pleasant! i never have to wait long, the food always taste great, and things are in order and clean. I love having a good manager that will come up to you and greet you when you walk in the door.   Thanks NYPD! we'll Be back!"}
{"text":"I went during a quiet time with my boys. I have never had New York pizza before all I knew was that it was thin crust. We ordered the garlic cheese knots and my boys loved it and I thought it was good. We ordered the large works pizza and the wait was less than expected. My boys filled up on garlic cheese knots and my wife was at work so it was up to me to be the taste tester. In the spirit of full disclosure I do not like thin crust pizza, it started because I do no like how greasy they are. The pizza was nice though, it wasnt greasy at all. The ingredients were fresh, I really enjoyed that. The employees were helpful and friendly.  I apologize to the waitress because I forgot your name. You were great. One of my kids was getting antsy and the waitress did I great job distracting them. The 4th star was given by my wife who ate the leftovers, she loved it. If the cost was less it would be getting 5 stars."}
{"text":"I like this place, especially for take home. Their garlic knots are to die for, the house salad is not just iceberg lettuce and the vinaigrette dressing is quite good. And the pizza, it is quite good. I used to work in a pizza joint so I am somewhat picky about the pizza I eat, and theirs is good and reliable. We just moved to the area and we tried Streets of NY first, and between the two, I will stick with NYPD."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great pizza begins with the dough. This place has it nailed down. The Hot wings are amazing as well. Just order anything and it'll be great."}
{"text":"Hawaiian pizza with fresh basil? YES PLEASE. This was our first time ordering from NYPD depsite the fact that we go to the nearby Fry's 2-3 times a week. We weren't disappointed. We also got the Hell's Kitchen wings, which were the perfect balance of spicy and flavorful. Already craving our next pizza!"}
{"text":"Thanks for the great customer service. Will definitely keep coming back. Food was even more delicious second time around."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza, especially the blanco pizza with tomatoes on it. Expensive though. 2 pieces for $7.00. I think that's really high. Maybe I am spoiled since a whole pizza at Sam's Club and Costco is $9.00.  This place is an occasional treat for me rather than a habit."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places. Love the pizza! Service is always great. Shout out to Justin and Zach - you guys are great and a true asset to this location.   We will be sure to make it in time again for Happy Hour. 3:30-5:30"}
{"text":"Great pizza. The dough they use is excellent. Apparently they alter/filter the water they use to make the dough to resemble that of New York city tap water. The result is great!! Ingredients are fresh, sauce is tasty. Overall, NYPD ranks a top 5 pizza place in the valley in my book. The service for the most part is great. On busy nights, it can be a tad on the slow side, but that goes for any restaurant. I've been to both the Chandler & Scottsdale Rd locations, and love them both. The Scottsdale location I like slightly more, just due to the 2nd story seating. Fun place and great eats."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by to grab a bite to eat before work and long story short -Greeted immediately  -Lots of variety -Meat lovers pizza is amazing -Ask for Tawnya she's really nice and a wonderful server  -Will be back, loved the excellent service!!"}
{"text":"OK I know NY Pizza, spent most of my life in NY/NJ  with the exception of using cornmeal and the pie's being smaller then what you would get in NY and slightly more expensive, but taste wise just about dead on!!!"}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza is good, and if that's all you need, then this is a good place to go.  If you have a few other things that are important, then you should drive on to the next spot.  Stuff like:  Service:  i've tried this place several times, and each time, i feel like i'm interrupting their work.  Price:  i was stunned silent.  i paid them what they asked for, although i can't imagine making that mistake again.  No, wait---- I found something good to say--- they have an excellent location."}
{"text":"The hubs and I have eaten here several times over the past 2 months since moving to this area. We've only done delivery but it's always gone smoothly and food arrives hot. The pizza is quite good, as are the wings and Greek salad. It's our go to pizza place now, and we thought we'd have a hard time replacing our previous place that we loved for years. Thanks NYPD for making a move to a new area a little less stressful ;-)."}
{"text":"Had a really great dinner tonight and our server Keith made the evening even better! Ravioli was great, meat lover's pizza was great, fried zucchini was great.. thanks for the suggestion Keith and for the great service!"}
{"text":"While traveling, this place hit the spot.  Actually they delivered to our hotel room. The pizza was good along with the meatball sandwich. Hard to find good local places, especially while traveling that deliver and show up on time and get the order right. If I am ever in the Phoenix Area again, I will look for this place and either order delivery or eat at the place."}
{"text":"Good Italian food, good service with very reasonable prices. Wish they were in South Jersey"}
{"text":"I love this place the food is always great will only get pizza so I should just say the pizza is always great and so is the service thanks guys keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Probably, our go to pizza place in Scottsdale. I like Grimaldi's a little better than L, but we both like pizza a lot. It's close, convenient, and a well run operation."}
{"text":"We no longer dine with NYPD after a series of increasingly bad experiences.   The latest happened today:  When they first opened they had no problem delivering to our address.  Now NYPD has decided that they will no longer deliver to our area because we are 1/2 block west of 19th avenue and they \"do not deliver west of 19th avenue.\"  I was informed of this only after being out on hold for 5 minutes  This company's internal processes are flawed and the customer pays for it."}
{"text":"It almost doesn't get any better.  Great prices, staff, atmosphere and food!  I recommend the Sicilian (thicker crust)"}
{"text":"To not bore you with my evening too much.  The Chandler NYPD Pizza is one of our favorite going out to eat spots. The service is excellent,  the servers treat you very well.  The food is always top notch. The owner even stops by to say hi.  Which is amazing because most companies couldn't care less if they're doing a good job as long as they have your  $$.   I definitely recommend this eatery."}
{"text":"I would give this place 10 stars if I could. Friendly people, great food, reasonable prices, great atmosphere....especially to watch a game.... and great service. NYPD always has and always will have the BEST PIZZA in Arizona, hands down."}
{"text":"How disappointing.  I have been a long-time customer over the years, but the last two trips to this restaurant have me questioning whether I should ever go back.    TERRIBLE trip #1:  I went with my family, a total of three of us.  My order was simple enough, a built-to-order calzone with three ingredients.  Three consecutive screw-ups later and I still did not have a calzone.  Another family member did not get what she asked for during round one, either.  No manager ever approached us.  Bad trip #2:  Just got back from having dinner there 20 minutes ago.  As soon as we were seated, a waiter looked at the hostess who was barely starting to walk away from our table and audibly said, \"You're killing me...Are you going to seat ANOTHER table in my area, too?\"  There were two of us.  Ended up that he was not our waiter.  Our waiter took a while to get to us, then another long while to get our waters to us.  Finally, I ordered a small salad from the salad portion of the menu, and my dinner partner ordered a sandwich exactly as the menu described it.  Neither one of us made modifications to our orders.    40 minutes later, my salad had been brought out, but no sandwich.  The waiter seemed very preoccupied with every other table except ours.  Other waiters came out with food and were asking us if we had ordered the items, all of which we had not.  In the meantime, other waiters and waitresses were going up to our waiter and telling him that he had food and drinks ready to be served from the bar and kitchen.  After another 15 minute wait, he brought the sandwich and simply said, \"Sorry, we have a new cook.\"    When I got the check, I saw that a small salad and a basic sandwich amounted to $15.  After reviewing the menu, $15 seemed to be a huge bargain compared to the price of a pizza or pasta.  Not that $15 is a lot to spend on dinner, but had we gone elsewhere we would have received more food for the price.    I will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here last night, and I love the idea of having New York filtered water in your crust. This is supposed to be the ingredient that makes real NY style pizza taste the way it does. I ended up ordering a sicilian style pizza, and got the full size pie.   My only complain in general would be the cost for my pie. Total after tax was 29 bucks, and thats a lot of money for just one pie. I understand the cost of food and labor along with the better quality ingredients, but I don't even spend that much on an Oreganos deep dish pie, and theirs actually taste better! The sicilian here doesn't really stand out. There's not enough sauce or cheese, and the toppings are just so so. The crust was nothing special, and I honestly thought that Pizza Hut's pan pizza tasted better. I got the Vinny, which has five toppings on it, and split my pizza with two on one side and three on the other. I got meatballs and tomatoes, and pepperoni, mushrooms, and black olives. Meatballs were dry as shit and sliced. Even Barro's has better meatballs! Everything else was just so so, I can get the same thing but better at Barros, at a fraction of the cost!   All in all, two stars for high cost and nothing to back it up. I get it, a bunch of people hype up your joint and that's fine, but follow through with it and make that 30 dollar pie blow my taste buds out of the water!"}
{"text":"Pizza Blanca or Baked Ziti....yummers.  Can't I have BOTH???  Love coming here..FEELS like pizza."}
{"text":"The very BEST gluten free vegan pizza I have ever eaten!  The normal folks in our group enjoyed their pizza too. Not a crumb left on our plates."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here and it was delicious! The pizza came on time and the delivery man was very professional. He opened the box and showed me the pizza before I accepted it. The pizza crust was crispy and the sauce was delicious. I added fresh basil to the pizza and it was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Being vegan, I was thrilled when NYPD began offering the Veganizza, and vegan cheese for custom orders. It is nice to have the option of ordering a pizza for pick or delivery now. It is a bit pricey, and despite only being 3.5 miles away, there is a delivery charge of $3, which I think is excessive, given the cost of the pizza. I do like that they have a record of your last order for easy reordering, but given I get a custom sometimes, I would like to see a better record so that I don't have to go online to go through the options again. That being said, for anyone plant based or with a dairy issue who doesn't mind a higher price for pizza, I would recommend it. I have never eaten there, only utilized pick up or delivery. Drivers have always been courteous."}
{"text":"Justin and Zach make it worth coming here. They give there customer individual attention while proving speedy and efficient service. Their service outshines the food, which is to die for. It is a must when you are in the Peoria/Glendale area. They are my go-to Friday night stop for all!"}
{"text":"This place is my Friday night end of the work week treat stopping by getting 2 slices and a soda.  The pizza has just the right amount of crispiness and the sauce has a great tangy taste to it.  I also do delivery whenever I have guests - they have great chicken wings with a great blue cheese dip.  Anything I try any combination from the mozzarella sticks to the salads have been exceptional and out of this world.  The staff is nice enough, very polite and the prices for Scottsdale standards are extremely fair.  This is a great place to stop in and get a quick bite and one of the best in our area.  I have never had a bad experience with them ever."}
{"text":"Love to come here for a quick bite to eat. I always order the garlic cheese knots to start us off. Tonight they were okay except for the fact that the cheese was non existent. I will know for next time to order extra cheese on them. The pizza was good as usual. My husband ordered a salad and loved it!"}
{"text":"I raved about this place to my family and decided to bring them here when I was in Phoenix yesterday about 1pm.  I had been here about a month ago and thought the pizza was very good, and the slices were generous.   I ordered three slices of pizza and had them cut one in half to share with my mom, since I remember the slices were large.  I was surprised when I received my order that the slices were about two-thirds smaller.  We all laughed at how small they were and wondered how I could justify the $17 I had just spent.  I wondered if the slices were smaller on the weekends, and asked a waitress that looked very busy with only one table to attend to.  She quickly replied \"No\" to my question and as I continued to tell her why I was wondering, I realized that she was long gone, leaving me talking to myself.  Which again, gave me and my family another good laugh.  Over all the customers service was poor.  The cashier was rushed and appeared bothered by our ordering and asking questions.  My friends ordered salads that only had lettuce and dressing.  No additional veggies or croutons.  It took three requests for 3 cups to get water before we got them, and then we only got one cup.  I was frankly embarrassed that I had brought them there but luckily it will be my last time.  The only reason I am giving this place two stars is because the pizza was good.  I don't just want to complain, I would also like to offer some suggestions. 1. Smile and greet the customers  2. Get items requested promptly  3. When a customer asks a question, acknowledge them, try to find and answer 4. Keep the food portions consistent"}
{"text":"It took over two hours to get in and out with a small party. The server did not know what to do. Bad service, but the food was good."}
{"text":"We've ordered pick-up and delivery from this location many times in the past, and have always had a pleasant and time efficient experience. Last night there was some miscommunication and our pick-up order was somehow misplaced. It was initially frustrating but the manager went above and beyond to ensure the situation was quickly rectified and ensured me the team was coached on the properly handling moving forward. She even personally called to follow-up and ensure we were satisfied after our food was delivered to us. I'm extremely impressed with how she handled what could have been a very bad customer experience. Our business has definitely been retained and I sincerely appreciate the manager's commitment to delivering a positive customer experience."}
{"text":"Food was great and reasonable. Had a party of 9 people and called ahead and they took us pretty quickly."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza and appetizers tonight for delivery, not only was it WAY overpriced, we waited over an hour and fifteen minutes and it was COLD! Not sure why it took so long to make basic items but we will not be ordering again!"}
{"text":"I love pizza, all kinds from all kinds of places-read my reviews (if they haven't all been filtered) and pizza is my thing.  Been to this location and one in Gilbert. Dunno if it really IS the water they allegedly ship in from the Big Apple, but their crust is pretty close to how I remember back east pizza being. The appetizers aren't that great, but the pizza is very good.   Took longer than it should have, for some reason I couldn't identify from the front-they weren't busy and our pizza wasn't complicated, but the wait was worth it.  Wish there was a location closer to my home, I could pop in here more often."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here and this isn't a reflection of the food. It's the shift in policy here whereby I can't just come in and order lunch at the counter if I want to without having a weird confrontation with someone about sitting, waiting, and ordering a $7 meal from the wait staff. It takes longer, ends up being more expensive and frankly I would probably make a different decision on where to eat. Either be a fast casual dining experience or don't be.  Seems like every time I come here it gets a little more awkward. Really frustrating when I get caught in the waited table trap and then 3 people walk in behind me and can do the fast casual approach because they either ignore the staff or don't get approached because staff is busy. Fix this."}
{"text":"Enjoy the Pizza and the staff has been friendly. Twice we have been there and both times ordered a dozen wings and both times we got 11 wings. Not sure if they do this every time to trick their customers or if they just can't count."}
{"text":"My first experience with NYPD Pizza was pretty decent. Service, food and experience was pretty good. However the next time I, with four friends, ordered in for delivery was very bad. The pizza took an hour, not a terribly long wait, but when it showed up the pizza was cold. As well as half of the pizza toppings being stuck to the top of the box. The cheesy garlic knots were barely melted and not the greatest as the other reviews led us to believe. Decent at the very best."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Nice Mother's Day discount! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Calzones here are the best! The ingredients are always so tasty and 6 bucks for a calzone loaded with them is a steal! Will definitely be back to this location! Well done guys. :)"}
{"text":"I stopped by at about 4:30/5, the place was a ghost town! I've came here a few times and the pizza is always great!  My most recent visit I got the \"Brooklyn Family\" style pizza, which has pepperoni, sausage and basil!  We also got the fried zuchinni!   Will definetly be back!"}
{"text":"If you don't mind the pizza being under cooked \"just a tiny bit\" then DUDE \"DA WORKS\" made my day!"}
{"text":"Omg we go here 2x /week.  Love it.  So delicious!!  Our favorites: Garlic knots Pizza (duh!) Calzones Spinach artichoke dip Greek salad Zeppolis  Not only is the food great, but we love the people who work there they're so kind and sweet.  If you have kids, they do a kids night Sun and Wed, it's pretty crowded we have found on those nights so we try to go other days.   Great place to watch sports games too they have a little bar which is fun to hang out in.  They have delivery too."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good... Pizza, pasta, Caprese salad.. Biggest complaint is the service. It's always horrible and slow. Food takes forever for some reason, at all their locations. If you're in a rush, don't bother."}
{"text":"Our last visit was four months ago and food was superb. We recently went again  on a Thursday night and our food was pretty bland. Seems like the food has changed. The table next to us complained about their pasta. We probably wont be back. Service was friendly but that doesn't mean I'll go back just to get cheerful refills of my iced tea."}
{"text":"Great pizza, we ordered Margerita and Bruschetta and both were very good. Nice crust, big slices, very nice restaurant and the inside, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for a slice and a brewski. Management was more than accommodating when there was a slight issue. Def recommend."}
{"text":"Soooo good!  Went for lunch and was able to find a table quickly.  You can tell a lot of people pop in to pick up and a good deal stop to eat.  As soon as the tables emptied, they filled again.  I ordered a pesto pizza and my husband ordered pepperoni, sausage and mushroom.   Took 20 minutes for the pizzas.  So worth the wait.  Loved it!  The atmosphere is very hip and modern.  The wait staff is dressed really classy.  I enjoyed the atmosphere as much as I enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"I stopped here on a week day in July. It was around 245pm, so very much a slow time of the day most anywhere. I sat at the bar and was immediately greeted and asked if I would like a soda or iced tea. There iced tea tasted like fresh brewed, so I assume it is fresh brewed. I had the margherita pizza. It was as good as any I have had in the area. I noticed on the menu they suggested I order crispy. I didn't opt for that, as not a fan of slightly burnt crust pizza. I  may go for it next time though. My waiter-bartender checked to see if my pizza was OK. In a bit the person that cooked my pizza also checked to see if everything was fine. This place is located just behind Loco Patron. (a great place for happy hour, or anytime). It's just off the light rail at the Mill Ave. stop......so that is a plus in the summer. I see why lots of people give NYPD pizza good reviews."}
{"text":"NYPD Pizza was delicious!!! The servers very nice & courteous, we ordered a large 'Da Works' pizza and it waas large!!! Enough to feed 4 people and still have 2 slices left, of course, after having a salad & the penne pasta!! We had Alicia as a server and she was very nice & attentive!! When we said it was our first time there & we were from CA, we received free dessert!!!! :0) we shared the     powdered donuts with chocolate fudge & raspberry sauce, courtesy of the owner!!! If im ever in AZ, i will definitely go there again! Highly recommend it!!! -"}
{"text":"Nypd pizza has terrible customer service. Don't give them your business and the manager named mike will not help you at all. A grain of rice holds more substance than he does"}
{"text":"Very good buffalo chicken ceaser salad. First try for this salad, excellent sauce. Buffalo chicken pizza was also very tasty. Zach the server was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Love me some hell's kitchen wings. Best wings I've had in the valley. They don't skimp on the bleu chess either. Lol."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here. It is the best in the valley. The Brooklyn Family is especially good, sausage, pepperoni and fresh basil. Terrific"}
{"text":"Gotta say,,,,I absolutely LOVE the Frank Sinatra Calzone !!! Been eating here for years now and I just have to say the Food is delicious . The Manager Angel Rojas ?? Stand up guy who's very Professional!!! I have nothing but positive remarks for both him and the employees there. If you haven't tried NYPD Pizza yet , You owe your tastebuds this treat."}
{"text":"Unpleasant phone experience when ordering. She didn't listen well. Ordered a side of ranch with my appetizer and got marinara. Took over an hour to be delivered for being 1 mile away. Pizza was so greasy. Not going back even with a $10 off coupon. Wish I could post a pic of the pizza. It's worth a 1000 tums. Oh I mean words."}
{"text":"I prefer the pizza served here to all of the other pizza I've tried in the area. The crust is thin but chewy. I really like the bruschetta pizza for the chunks of ricotta. The only reason I removed a star is because the wait for delivery is pretty excessive. I have ordered four times and waited over an hour each time, so plan ahead."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for great food and great service.  Their pizza and gluten-free pizzas are the best in town.  The Italian wedding soup and their seasonal salads are delicious.  Thank you Samson for providing excellent service on our most recent visit.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great pizza mainly because the crust is so good.  Get clam and onion, trust me, this isn't a joke, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Went on a busy Friday night with young kids. Pizza took a while because it was so crowded. Pizza came out a little imperfect. Although it didn't taste any different. Was comped a pizza which we didn't ask for. The staff and manager went above and beyond to make us happy. And the pizza was awesome! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The last time we were going to Oregano's the wait 45 minutes and that was to sit ouside....no way.  So my husband and myself went to NYPD pizza (just across the parking lot) instead.  The food and service is about 100% better than Oregano's.  We were greeted to a smile and the wait staff could not have done a better job. The food is very good and inexpensive.  Personally I loved the bruschetta (alot more than we got across the alley), the wings and we had the best pizza.  I will be going to NYPD Pizza instead of Oregano's from now on."}
{"text":"This is our go to pizza place, the service is great, never have been disappointed. Ryan, especially, is a great guy and the best waiter we've had, period. Pizza is awesome here, the sandwiches are great, calzones, wings, everything. Cute place inside, and the kids like to draw pictures on the paper plates they give you and they tape them up on the wall. Police and Fire get a 10% discount. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow! We were told a 45 min to 1 hr wait at Oreganos at 830pm and were expected to wait in the cold with our 6 month old so we decided to try NYPD and were seated immediately. They even thought to ask if we would like to be upstairs because it was empty and much quieter for our sleeping babe. OMG we will never be going to Oreganos again! Absolutely amazing service! On top of that the food was SO much better! We had honey hot wings, bruschetta and a large build your own pizza - enough for an army! (Clearly our eyes were bigger than our stomachs lol) We ended up eating way more than necessary because it was THAT good!! Highly recommend NYPD!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. My family and I drive down from Texas sometimes just to have their pizza"}
{"text":"Our favorite lunch  Pizza Special in the valley!  We get the huge 5 topping Pizza slice with garlic knots at lunch!  To die for!  Cheap too!  The best and  always great service.  Oh yes and best zepolies and best hot cookie with ice cream around!"}
{"text":"This was a great first time for my wife and I at NYPD  Pizza. Great service and the pizza and wings were perfect and prompt. Overall great trip for a quick bite for lunch."}
{"text":"The wings here are Horrible! .. they are too chewy, rubbery and way overcooked.. worst ones I ever had.. totally spoiled my Friday evening fun (considering myself a foodie)"}
{"text":"this was across my workplace when i was in az. me and my co workers always ending up going to this place at least once a week because you just can't go wrong. my favorite is the jalapeno pizza which i always partner up with a side salad and an ice tea. finding a table can sometimes be a pain during lunchtime, but hey who can't blame them. this place is just that good. don't forget to get garlic knots on the side too if you feel like splurging on the calories, haha."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!! The service is even better than the food. My server was Matt and he was great. I highly recommend the cannolis!"}
{"text":"Rude customer service on telephone and not very helpful. The lady didnt even know what kind of salad dressing was on a greek salad and still messed it up! Hells Kitchen wings were dry and barely even mild. We live 0.8 miles away and delivery was between 1 hour and an hour and a half at 8:00. Then they were rude again upon delivery. One bright side was the calzone was good despite lacking ingredients ordered. Also a delivery fee is bogus after they made us add to our order to even get it delivered. Save yourself and go to Streets of New York very close by instead!"}
{"text":"I go here fairly regularly for lunch and have always enjoyed the pizza slices and that is where the three stars comes from. I got takeout last night for dinner. Two small pizzas and they were not good. These are pizzas I have had in the past and they have been good, Vinny's favorite and the blanco pizza. This time, the pizza was tasteless. I don't know what happened, but I will definitely think twice before going again. I don't even want to eat the leftovers. Too bad, but there are other pizza places nearby."}
{"text":"It's a fine place if you like cold undercooked pizza. Maybe that's the way the sicilian is supposed to be? Though I've had the sicilian delivered from other stores hot. This one wasn't steaming when it arrived, cheese wasn't fully melted. Cut into a slice and the inner crust was lukewarm, but nowhere could we find a hot spot.  They offered to fix it, but there's nothing that puts you off pizza than a really bad one. We weren't charged for it."}
{"text":"As i work close to nypd pizza,getting food to go was an easy and quick experience,the wait staff,savhanna I believe her name was,was delightful and made the experience wanting me to come back again..Great food,friendly faces,definitely a must try"}
{"text":"The food is really good and service fast and friendly.  A place I do recommend and will return to."}
{"text":"After my initial review, I was contacted by NYPD Corporate Office. A very sincere apology was made along with a promise to investigate the reason for food leaving their restaurant that not only didn't meet my standards, but the standards of the restaurant itself.  The very next day I was contacted by the manager of the 83rd and Union Hills restaurant. He too, apologized sincerely and asked that I give them another chance.  I also received a refund for my meal. This was not asked for or expected, but it was very much appreciated. Because of my experience at other locations and mostly because of the very professional and sincere way NYPD handled this situation... They've earned back my business!"}
{"text":"Just had there gluten free pizza and ive had them all and they all usually taste almost the same ,however theirs did not. It was much better lol and there tomato sauce was amazing... imma very picky about my sauce, and the italian sausage was on point, the service coulda been better but it was bad by any means, i will definitley be back for more ! Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Is it ridiculous to pay $35 for a medium pizza & dozen wings?! Not if its the Brooklyn Family (med feeds 4 easy btw) & Hells Kitchen wings!   Hands down, best delivery pizza in town.  if it only cost me $25, I'd have given it all five stars. ;)"}
{"text":"Food was great but service was terrible!  Especially for as slow as the restaurant was on a Sunday evening. We had Lyndsey as a hostess and server and she didn't even end helping us. We had to ask to place our order, ask for silverware, ask for drink refills, send our order back with someone else because it was wrong and our waitress was no where to be found when we needed something. I spoke with manager and she did take some money off our bill but still the experience was not nice for a family dinner. I have a Groupon to go back again but I will definitely be calling to make sure this person isn't there before we go."}
{"text":"Love all of the food at nypd pizza. They have amazing gluten free pizza and delicious salads. The staff, including the delivery team is incredibly friendly and always smiling. It's great when staff is knowledgeable about their food especially because I am gluten free and not by choice. I find a lot of places think it's to be healthy and don't really understand what it means.   Definitely recommend their gf pizza. One of my regular spots in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Food was ok but service was horrible. One of the employees was super rude, his name was Josh and look like an oversized 12 year old. Please tell Wario to fix his attitude"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. About a year ago I ordered delivery and they lost our order it took over two hours. We hadn't been back until today.   I just didn't want Rosati's again we get it almost every Friday. Just burned out.   So I thought small pizzas and the beef salad. I go online and they don't have the beef salad anymore! So sad. The menu has changed a lot. So I ordered a 14 inch cheese/pepperoni for the boys and Da Works 14 inch. They said it would take 1 hr 15 minutes to deliver or 40 to pick up. I said deliver it's a wash with the drive.   They made it in 1 hour 30 minutes much better than last time. But the pizza just wasn't good. The crust wasn't crisp like it used to be and the toppings were bare. Maybe one thin piece of sausage on each slice. Crust was flavorless.   The price was way cheaper than Rosati's about $34 for the two pies but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite. I love the pizza and the garlic knots . Always friendly service and kids love drawing on the plates and hanging them on the wall."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. The crust is just the way I like it. I usually prefer Chicago style to NY but this tasted great. The sauce tastes good with just the right amount of spices. I'll definitely be back every time I go to AZ."}
{"text":"Moved here from NY a couple months and I went to this place hoping to satisfy a craving. I was disappointed. The pizza did not taste like anything let alone NY pizza. I did not think this was bad but I definitely will not be having pizza from here again. Now the fried chicken...is a different story. They gave me a piece of fried chicken for some strange reason and it was really good. I don't see it on the take out menu but I'd definitely ask for it."}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars here and I love the pizza!    We started getting an 18\" because I felt like we were getting gipped a bit when we got the 16\" as they'll usually use a differently sized pan to make it and it always seemed to be a bit closer to 14\" than 16\" (I'm big on pizza and I KNOW my sizes!).  It always tastes good though.  We also get the honey bbq wings a lot, but lately I've been wondering if they've switched their supplier to a cheaper one, as we've gotten wings where the bone has been broken vs. cut and it has that bone marrow taste/smell which has put me off wings (at least for the time being).  All in all though, this displaced East Coaster is a big fan (as are my fellow East Coast siblings!)"}
{"text":"I pick/get delivery here at least once a week no complaints so far I like every items I have ordered here"}
{"text":"Not the absolute best Italian food, but pretty darn good. My favorites are garlic cheese knots, pizza, and pasta dishes! The Hero's are not so good though. All the dishes are huge -- definitely big enough to share! Great take out food!"}
{"text":"Great for a quick lunch and a pint. Service from Caroline was excellent, everything was out promptly and very tasty"}
{"text":"Upstate wings have perfect crisp on the outside and the meat is tender on the inside. We order a 14 inch pizza with garlic, gargonzola and pepperoni. Gargonzola is not listed as an addtl topping but you may order it. That combination is so delicious."}
{"text":"I have worked at NYPD Pizza for a little while now, but even before I worked here I always loved the pizza. My family used to drive to the camelback location which took about 20 minutes because we would just crave the Sicilian pizza. I know this may seem biased because I work here, but even if I didn't work here, I would honestly say that New York Pizza Department is my favorite place, be it lunch or dinner, to get pizza."}
{"text":"Customer service was horrible. When I called and asked how much extra toppings were the response I got was \"I have no idea\". I was completely shocked and when I tried to clarify it he said \"I don't know, I think they're $1-2 each\". I was about to hang up, but decided to go through with the order. Went to pick it up and after paying I was fumbling the change to put back into my wallet and the guy starts to talking to the customer behind me as I'm still at the counter. I could definitely tell that he did not care about his job at all. The food was good, but nothing special. Definitely over priced for the quality. Won't be returning to again."}
{"text":"The pizza is good.  So are the garlic knots.  The service at this location is hit or miss.  I've had better luck at their location near 22nd and Highland, next to the Fry's.  This is especially true for to-go orders.  The space at this location is nice though.  It feels much larger, and has a cool industrial feel."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. Came into eat good pizza. Sat for 20 mins without any type of service. Zero menu, zero water and zero waitress. Sad thing no one else was in the place except for one guy sitting at the bar drinking. Food maybe good but service sucks. Would not be coming here ever again."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza, calzone, hero and fried mozzarella.  The pizza was outstanding and everyone loved it!  The calzone was mostly cheese, hardly any meat, and overbearing rocatta when i ordered only mozzarella. The fried mozzarella was good but only 3 in an order for 7.99! And the meatball hero was delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is typically good at NYPD. However, this trip has been a wait fest. My wife and I have waited an hour or so for something that takes 20 minutes. At this point we are being held hostage. Please send help!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried out this pizza place yesterday--pretty good! They have pretty decent lunch specials too."}
{"text":"We always enjoy going here.  The pizza is yummy and the service is great too!  On our last trip, we accidentally forgot to take our credit card back with us after paying.  We didn't realize it until the next day.  We called them and the manager was so nice.  He told us that they had our credit card locked in their safe.  Phew!  When we stopped by to pick it up, he wanted to know if we enjoyed our meal the night before.  He was genuinely interested to hear our feedback.  It showed us that they really care about their customers.  We will definitely keep going back."}
{"text":"So, we all thought we were having a nice dinner and a couple beers. The manager rachiele decided we had enough to drink and cut is off after watching an 12 year old and a 40 something year old go to the restroom the manager decided we had had enough to drink. No one was loud, no one was obnoxious. Not sure at all what the managers issue was. But we were cut off and not allowed to drink anymore.  She was so wrong in her decision that she compt our entire meal. She was rude and obnoxious, and even threatened to call the police when we went back in to tip or waiter, who was nothing but great. I would not recommend this location to anyone until this manager is removed."}
{"text":"Check this place out! Homey atmosphere, small enough to get great, detailed service, but big enough that we have always been seated right away.  The pizza is excellent.  If you are not that hungry, order the My 'Za.  It is a personal size pizza made with the same delicious quality of the bigger pizzas."}
{"text":"I love the food here. It is delicious and really hits the spot when your craving some good pizza. I had never Sat down to eat. Always take out. But I decided to bring my daughter in and sit down and have dinner with her (she is 6)  As always the food was great. Our waitress fabien was fantastic! So accommodating! She was happy and so helpful. I will be back to dine in again with service like that. Well done!"}
{"text":"OMG. I love love LOVE this place. When my family and I come to Arizona, we usually order it for pick up and it's another family favorite."}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant on my birthday. We were terribly disappointed. We ordered pizza and pasta and an appetizer. The food was alright not the same standards as years ago. The service of the staff was horrendous! We had to get our own drinks, look for our own napkins and they were demeaning. My 7 year old had the kids meal which included an ice cream scoop. They just came and said they ran out of dessert. No apologies, I will not return. They are sending me email to nominate them to have the best pizza? There are many more places out there with better pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza in nice restaurant.  Best in town from the restaurants we visited.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We stopped in Friday night for the first time and were very impressed. The pizza tasted very fresh and you could savor the flavors of the toppings, not just the dough. Our server was Cody and he was excellent. Thanks for a good first time experience. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I love the pizza dough at NYPD. You can't go wrong with Vinny's Favorite. You choose your five favorite toppings. We usually go with pepperoni, italian sausage, ham, roma tomatoes and basil. Go ahead and order the upstate wings and salad before you order your pie because it takes around 20 minutes for the pizza to finish cooking. If you still have room, order the San Gennaro Zeppolis. They are covered in powdered sugar and are served with chocolate and raspberry sauces. I'm pretty sure I gained 5 lbs writing this review."}
{"text":"Better than I expected. Being a native NYer I'm always suspect of claims to NY pizza in places like AZ. The place itself had a nice element to it that included a post of Broadway and 42ND St and another of 14th St with other signs that looked to be spelled out in subway letters. With a wine bar and TVs as well. But the pizza itself was very good with highly respectable and tasty sauce. I had purchased the veggie pizza, mushroom pizza and chicken pizza and they were all delicious. Will be back for a pie next time."}
{"text":"Pizza is average and mediocre. They're skimpy with their toppings and pricey for slice for little toppings they put on it. Good service friendly staff, but they need to put more toppings to make it worth it."}
{"text":"Pizza was good maybe not spectacular.  What made them stand out was that we chose to wait outside in the evening air while they prepared the pizza to go and they brought it out to us."}
{"text":"NYPD is the old standby.  Always consistent always good.  I recently had the Italian beef salad.  It was different, but good.  The wings, salads, meatballs and most importantly pizza are all good as well.  The service is always good.  We have been going to NYPD since they opened their first restaurant on Via Linda ( it is now something else) .  You will never go wrong at NYPD."}
{"text":"The folks at NYPD have made me a BIG fan.  The pizza is good: fresh and tasty with a unique crispy almost pastry crust - they say they import the water from NYC - true? who knows but it works.  And what really wins me over is their commitment to community and service.  My son just returned from 2 years rehab as a wounded warrior from Afghanistan - lost both legs and much of the use of his left arm, as well as lots of other injuries.  NYPD supported his welcome home and made it clear that their community is as important to them as it is to us.  From reading others' reviews, this community attitude seems to trickle all the way to the table side service.  Bravo to a locally owned business that takes pride in their quality product and dedication to their customers."}
{"text":"I have never had anything but the very best food and service at NYPD Pizza. They have the most delicious pizza and calzones for a good price, slices and small calzones for lunch, and salads that are just amazing.  It is a small place, but that only increses the feeling that you're being taken care of by friends. I really do applaude the folks behind this little chain and hope that they will never sacrifice the high quality of their food.  If you like great pizza, I mean really great pizza, then you MUST give NYPD Pizza a try. You will be impressed I am sure."}
{"text":"Prompt service. Great food.  I had the personal sized pizza and it was the perfect amount."}
{"text":"Stopped on the way to the airport as we were flying back home. Pizza was good. Any opinion would be based on personal taste; as I prefer a thin crust pizza or \"real\" Chicago pizza. The food seemed fresh and was hot."}
{"text":"So it's been a couple of months since I've been there.  I get the wings except this time.  Wings are priced as \"market price.\"  So charge whatever they want?  I like to know how much things cost on the menu.  Ok Lobster is one thing...but chicken wings?  It was kind of a turn off.  Pizza was good though."}
{"text":"We love this pizza.  Went there today and ordered a Soho salad pizza. It was ordered with no tomatoes or almonds. It was brought out with almonds and tomatoes by a gentleman we later learned was the manager. We expressed to him that we had asked for no almonds or tomatoes and apologized and took it back.  The Soho comes back with our waitress with tomatoes. We again expressed to her that we did not want tomatoes and she says she will get the manager and leaves it on the table.  Several minutes go by and the manager came out and apologized and said he had a large catering order on the phone and neglected to tell the kitchen no tomatoes.  He took it back and a short time it came out for the third time correctly.  Considering all the issues one would have expected the Soho to be comp'd. When we got the bill it was still on there.  We paid the bill and expressed to the waitress that it was disappointing that we were still charged for the Soho when it took 3 times to get it correct.  She told us that she thought the manager would have taken it off but he didn't and she apologized. The whole point of having dinner together is to eat together.  Because of the issues this didn't happen as my pizza would have been cold.    Bummer experience all around.    Returned today for take out.  Pizza was good and made just like we ordered.  We are very satisfied with this visit and the excellent food!!!"}
{"text":"Can't speak for the pizza.  We just had pasta entrees.  Very bland sauce.  There's a reason there's a line out the door at Oregano's (across the parking lot) and not at NYPD pizza.  I wish I had waited that 15 minutes at Oregano's."}
{"text":"This is the 4th nypd that I've eaten at and it's always good no matter what location you are at. The pizza is true new york style where you can give it a nice fold and chow down. The wings have incredible flavor and have a nice crisp to them.   One complaint- they only have dine-in on weekends. During the week you can order at the counter and seat yourselves if your in a hurry and don't have time for full service. Why only offer this on weekdays? They get just as packed on the weekend. I would eat here twice as often if I was about to get out of there a little bit faster. Don't need a waitress, thanks though."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this NYPD location as it's right by my house. I also frequent the location by my office.   Great for the lunch specials (M-F 11-4) and I usually get a couple of slices or pasta marinara (which comes with yummy garlic knots!). There's just something about their pizza dough that keeps me coming back like an addict.  Great customer service and this location has a nice large area for those eating in.  Parking can be a bit of a pain but there are useful carry out parking spots if you're just picking up!"}
{"text":"I appreciate NYPD for what they are and what they don't pretend to be.  What you'll get:  - Good pizza, this can challenging here in the Valley - A fair price for said pizza, again can be challenging here - A nice, friendly cashier when you place/pick up your order  What you won't deal with: - Pretentious customers - A menu so diverse that you forgot where you were - Slow service  NYPD is a part of our \"take out circuit\""}
{"text":"I have lived in the valley for 4 years now and have tried stupid amounts of pizza joints except NYPD until last weekend. I was watching my friends dogs and went to get some lunch and wanted to try NYPD since I have heard good things. It was midday on a Saturday and I was sat instantly in a booth and given a menu.  I ordered a \"My 'Za\" 8\" pepperoni and a order of garlic knots. The knots were nothing special and I assume they bought them from Frys next door as you can tell they were pre-frozen from the slight rubbery texture BUT they were still good.  The pizza was great, the crust is my favorite as it has the perfect blend of crisp and soft. Alot of places in the valley are one extreme or the other.  I literally had 3 people waiting on me for some reason but my main waitress (Stephanie?) was great and when my meal was done and I paid, the Manager (I assume) approached me about it being my first time eating there and he gave me a discount coupon for a free desert on the next visit, nothing fancy but a well accepted gesture and alot of businesses could learn from this small gesture of customer interaction.  All-in-all, I enjoyed the experience and will eat there again."}
{"text":"The 3 star definition of Yelp is perfect for this place. A-OK. That's it.  Decent pizza, good greek salad, fair prices.  Nothing memorable but nothing to leave with a bad memory.  The amount of food is good for the price.  The space is pretty comfortable, it has a flare that makes it fell cozy.   If you're out of ideas/options in the neighborhood, it's a good call.  Cheers."}
{"text":"I want to give four stars for the food, but one for the service, which is sad because I love their Sicilian Pizza.  It's always good and two pieces fill me up making lunch the next day easy.  This is the third time my family and I have gone there and the third time the service was excruciatingly slow.  We got there around 7pm on a Friday and there was one hostess working the front and only helping one group at a time.  Hello?  How about taking names and party size?  It wasn't even that busy, the place was  1/2 full. When we finally got seated our server was over quick and took our drink orders.  Drinks arrived and our order was taken in a timely manner. . .so far, so good. I'm pretty sure that our server either forgot our ticket or the kitchen lost it because it doesn't take 35 minutes to drop an order of cheese sticks.  5 minutes in the fryer and you're done. I'm pretty sure it was our server because the tables he was handling were all waiting, while others who came in after him were being served.  We did the whole \"look annoyed\" thing but the wife noticed our server avoiding eye contact.  I stopped the hostess three time as she walked by for more drinks, which she graciously got us (making up for the seating fiasco) Then I did something I don't normally do.  I asked for the manager.  I told him we love the food but this was the third time we had been there and the service was slow each time.  To his credit, he comped our entire meal (minus my beer.)  We leaned over to the table next to us that had 3 older couples out for dinner that had been waiting almost 40 minutes for their meals and told them we had been comped and they should complain too.  When we left they still hadn't been served. I sincerely hope they complained and got their meals for free too.  On our way out the manager was by the register and so was the hostess that helped us, I paid for the beer I had and tipped the hostess $20, telling her and the manager she actually did most of the serving, so she deserved the tip.  Come to think of it, I don't know what happened to our server because he didn't bring our food out to us and after we talked with the manager, we didn't see him anywhere in the place the rest of the time we were there. I'll still order takeout and delivery from them as I've never had a bad meal there, but my days of dining in at NYPD Pizza in Surprise are over."}
{"text":"We went for dinner before a show at The Marquee and were very disappointed.    We ordered the fried zucchini, the breading was the only good part, it was thick and crunchy..... that is where it stopped being good, the inside was mushy and had no flavor at all.  We also ordered the margarita pizza, it was equally disappointing.  The pizza was wet, as in when you picked up a slice it actually dripped,  the toppings slid off and the crust was mushy.  The service was slow.  We ordered 2 items and were there over an hour, it wasn't busy at all.  In the time we were there, we were visited 3 times total by servers; once to order, once to get our food, and once when the check was dropped off.    We will not be back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I are pizza aficianados and decided to try NYPD Pizza.  This was the closest location to us, so last Thursday, we ventured over.  I ordered a 4-item special pizza with pepperoni, sausage, onion, and anchovies (all self-respecting Italians have anchovies on their pizza).  My daughter order a calzone.  It all went downhill from there.  My daughter's calzone arrived burnt literally BLACK.  Complaining to the manager was an exercise in futility.  He was rude and dismissive.  My pizza was pretty good, but expensive.  My daughter managed to scrape enough burned crust off her calzone to eat it.  She said it was otherwise OK, but had too much ricotta cheese.  I want to note that the restaurant staff were friendly and cheerful.  But the manager soured the entire experience.  Apparently, the manager feels that they have more than enough customers, so engendering goodwill is not necessary. We will not be returning.  Red Devil Pizza is every bit as good, if not better - and they will bend over backwards to make good on anything that is wrong."}
{"text":"I love coming here! The food is great and I love the service. I always ask for savanna when I come. She is extra helpful and gives me a five star experience every time!"}
{"text":"Just recently moved here and heard that NYPD pizza was the place to go. I decided to check it out today and all I can say is that I was pretty disappointed. I had ordered a pizza for pick up. I had also specifically asked for extra pizza sauce and the pizza was cold and dry. Definitely didn't get my money's worth."}
{"text":"Best pizza!   Best NY Pizza Place in the Valley!!!!  Again another wonderful and delicious meal.  Amy and Maria were awesome!  We go there mainly for the service---ask for Amy when you go!  The manager on duty (forgive me I can't recall his name---bow tie is awesome touch) was very attentive to not only ya but everyone.  World Class place and out of this universe pizza!!!   Raises for all of them!!!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch deal and Tawnya is a wonderful and friendly employee for NYPD.  Have known her from this location and another one for over 10 years."}
{"text":"We frequently eat at NYPD and continue to come back because the pizza is fantastic, the service is always great, and they have great salads and little apps as well. I was in this last week grabbing a couple of slices and salads with my boyfriend, and Scott, the GM, stopped by our table to check on everything. We chatted for a while about our upcoming trip to Hawaii and he shared a couple of his favorite places with us. It was so nice to see the personal attention to his guests, as the restaurant was busy and he was stopping by many tables but it wasn't just the quick touch-and-go \"Hi-how's-your-meal-okay-great-bye!\"  Additionally, our server (I think his name was Justin but I could be wrong - light hair and thick-rimmed glasses) was fantastic and so friendly. We felt taken care of and it's one of the things that keeps us coming back to eat here.   Thanks so much for the great experience Scott and Justin (I hope I'm not getting your name wrong)! :)"}
{"text":"It is our favorite pizza place in the Downtown area and I'm sure a few of my coworkers can agree with this statement.   The place is spacious, clean and well designed. You will find here fresh ingredients, hearty good looking portions, and the staff is very attentive and courteous.   If you really like pizza come and eat here. As a business owner  I love this place because it allows me to relax, enjoy my lunch and also bring along some of my customers."}
{"text":"Because I'm an Arizona Sports radio fan, I hear NYPD Pizza commercials and promos all the time. So tried the downtown location for lunch one day.   I loved the atmosphere. Felt on par with other modern-retro-industrial look and feel of restaurants today. We were called \"boys\" as the wait staff made their best impressions of New Yorkers. Didn't mind one bit.   Got the basic 2 slice and a drink combo of the lunch specials. Paid 10 buck that included tip. All together the bill glass a bit over 7 dollars. The crust was a perfectly thin which was crunchy but yet soft.   Didn't like the \"no gun\" signage on the front door. If you carry, you might not want to go here. I normally don't support those that do not support the 2nd amendment but will make exceptions from time to time.   Politics aside, excellent pizza which deserves 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I have been many times and it is always great! I really get pizza because I love their seasonal salads so much. I have also been to several other locations with the same great result."}
{"text":"The pizza was absolutely delicious. And the honey hot wings were the best I've had in a long time. Kimberly was always on top of our beer and let me know they now carried my favorite beer, angry orchard!  We will definitely be back soon! Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"NYPD Pizza AZ New York Pizza Department...when it comes to pizza there are many choices, but for the Reilly's our tradition around the Holidays is a night out at NYPD...Great location and and just enough seats to make you feel like your at a local pizza joint in NY.  Big shout out to Matt and his staff as they are a Customer First restaurant with great service and great PIZZA! One of the cleanest restaurants I have eaten at in Arizona!  First the Wings are a must...we go for the Upstate Style Wings (Traditional) a family fave. Just enough spice and a TON of flavor! Now the Pie...with so many choices you can't go wrong, but you must try the Brooklyn Family. With each slice loaded with Pepperoni, Sausage, Fresh Basil all on that Awesome traditional NY style crust...Could Be Award Winning!  Nope we're not don yet. You have to try the Zeppoli, deep fried pizza dough tossed with cinnamon and sugar a new favorite..."}
{"text":"WOW!  I have never been to a place with service this horrible.  I may have caught them on a bad night, but I'm not giving them a second chance to find out!  I came in with a group of 4.  We stood up front for 5-10 minutes before waving someone down to be seated.  That was a mistake..  As we're waiting for a server to take our drink order, we noticed that EVERY single table had empty cups waiting to be refilled, dirty plates that needed bussing, and people with impatient faces.  There was only 1-2 dedicated servers, and they completely ignored us.  We stuck around just to see how long it would take before someone took our drink order, it was like being in the Twilight Zone.  After 30 minutes and flagging down 3 employees, we just walked out laughing, no one had even apologized for the wait, I'm not sure they even saw us leave!  It was the strangest restaurant experience of my life.  What a joke...  **EDIT**  To their credit, right after I posted this review, I received a message explaining that the Director of Operations would like to amend the situation, even going so far as to include their cell number.  I admit that I feel strange posting such a negative statement amid all the 4 and 5 star reviews, I'm assuming I caught them on a really bad night.  I'll edit this if I ever return to the restaurant, but the fact that someone actually reached out to try to rectify things says something"}
{"text":"Best place to get a vegan pizza! I've tried others but nothing compares to the NYPD's. Plus you don't have to just order the Veganizza, they're sauce and dough is doesn't contain animal products to you can pretty much build you own pizza with veggie toppings. Now all they need is to have some meat substitutes and vegan desserts and I would be in cruelty free pizza heaven (@_@)"}
{"text":"Favorite place to get pizza! And the reason behind this due to a very special someone at this store. He's caring, funny, smart, and not to mention very VERY hot. Don't get me wrong the pizza is hot and fine but so is this manager."}
{"text":"Went here with a girlfriend during happy hour and took advantage of one of their special.. 2 slices of pizza + 24oz drink and total came out to be around $13. Not bad at all. Pizza was amazing & the slices are pretty big. Our server was super friendly and patient with us taking so long on deciding which pizza to order, she even gave us to-go drinks without us asking! Would recommend"}
{"text":"I am 50+ and come here all the time and just got carded- Whhaat? I thought they quit carding everybody 10 years ago and empowered people to use common sense- it sort of pissed me off!! Awesome food though!! We will come back"}
{"text":"NYPD has Always been a Fave & now they're nearing the very top of our list (as long as they don't do away w/ their Veganizza & Pizza Blanca 4 us Veg~heads) & GLUTEN FREE is a MAJOR + !!! Thank U 4 having/offering these #1Derful options 4 those of us who r'nt carnivores as there wouldn't b much 4 us 2 order 2 patronize ur eatery!!     I'm not a fan of pizza dough but their's is on another scale that I actually eat the crust 2 (which I don't do w/ other pizza). We had/shared between us Spinach salad (sans the bacon), Caprese, Spinach/Artichoke dip, & Zucchini sticks were all Absolutely AHHhmazing as usual but our main reason 4 coming: Veganizza & Pizza Bianca we had r PERFECTION 2 die 4... seriously Exceptional in flavors & texture!!!     On previous visits we've had the Soho salad pizza, greek salads, Eggplant & the Chelsea chopped salad (minus the bacon)... all So Delicious & especially luv the salad pizza concept, pls keep this 2!!      We usually like 2 sit in the outside section because my guilty pleasure is watching any of the birds flitting around the bushes & scavenging 4 crumbs which I someXs 'accidentally' drop in my occasional clumsiness. Also the service has always been impeccable whenever we've gone which is truly appreci8ed & a very integral part of the dining experience!     We luv the cannolis/kisses & we've had the tiramisu in the past which was AWESOME 2 (but not offered on menu anymore)? We have yet 2 try the limoncello cake but will save that in anticip8ion 4 our next visit. NYPD ROCKS & really hope they keep these Veg~head/Gluten~Free faves of ours so we can continue our business w/ this establishment!!!"}
{"text":"Well I wish I could post a positive review but my experience was so bad tonight I find it impossible to do so.. We arrived on a Friday night @5:45pm for dinner. Party of 3. We were seated immediately, parking space right up front....off to a great start  We ordered our drinks, appetizers, and meal. Pasta for my adult son, pasta for my husband and a personal sized pizza for myself.  Appetizers and drinks right on time.  And now comes the issue...... the meal came, pastas correct, pizza wrong toppings.  I started to try to eat it and the bottom was very very overdone.  As hungry as I was I had no choice but to return it.  The server advised they would rush it... moments later the manager appeared, apologized and stated it was already in the oven...advised 8 minutes and I would have the pizza. The men tried to eat slowly as I noted  the time...22 minutes later with no return from the manager or updates from the waitress I got the attention of my waitress and asked for the check and advised to forget the pizza.   The men had been done eating for quite sometime and our outing was certainly ruined..  to my shock the waitress said oh ok and brought me the check  She returned to say the pizza will be done in 2 minutes can I box it for you.   In summation: Oreganos is a very nice pizza place 3-4 miles from this location and Grimaldi's is across the street."}
{"text":"My family and I recently came in here for a rather enjoyable evening moment of togetherness and food disperse. The food was over exceptional quality and was presented in a timely manner. In particular, our gracious server JOSH was well adept at performing his given duties and then some. His bright and caring attitude made for a comfortable exchange...perhaps a closer eye on this one. HUH management?"}
{"text":"This place is so good and a relief from your average dominos or Pizza Hut!! Great service and friendly staff. Thanks for the yummy pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! The service...well. I called in a to go order and was told it would be 30 min. So I showed up about 25 min later. The pizza was not ready and they told me it would be another 15 min. I don't mind but it would have been nice to know so I would have come later. So I decided to have a beer at the bar. The server was so busy gossiping about a coworkers hair that she stood there with my drink for about 5 min, until I said something. The staff was just more concerned with themselves then any of the customers. Once I finally got the pizza it was awesome like always. Great food but the staff could use a brush up on etiquette."}
{"text":"The service was terrible the food mediocre and the interior was glaring!! We used to frequent the previous location on Union Hills. Sadly,it was more pleasant and welcoming!  We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Went the other night because Oreganos had a wait. Glad we did.  Jeffery was serving us, and he did an excellent job. We ordered the Upstate Hot Wings and a 14\" Brooklyn Family. The wings came 'sloppy' (bathing in hot sauce) which is always a plus for me. I hate wings that come out like they were basted with a brush with hot sauce.   The pizza was delicious. I love the fact that the sausage is sliced and looks like pepperoni. And whatever cheese they use, MUAH! Delicious!  Jeffery probably had 6 tables at once, and he was always attentive. Ran everything perfectly!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! I give 4 stars for how expensive it is for toppings. We bought 2 mediums with 3 toppings and some wings. It was 75$ and we did take out. Other than that... Pretty delicious food."}
{"text":"$24.  1.25 hrs.  No parm or red pepper as requested.  They did deliver a second time and got it right.  Happy they want to please their customers!"}
{"text":"We have been going to this location since 2012. Our first visit was uneventful.  The waiter was horrible. He took a long time to take our order. The food was good. We had decided not to return after that. I must say that the food was good so we decided to go back. Again we received bad service. In March of 2012 my husband was diagnosed  with cancer . He had to go thru vigorous  treatment   and had to follow  a strict diet. He wanted to eat pizza before his next battle of test. Despite my protest we went back. That was a great decision.  We got there and was seated.  We sat and we're talking among ourselves. Our waitress came up and ask how we were doing. She took our order. She was very friendly.  I didn't think much of it. We ate and left.  As my husband went through  his battle  all he wanted was NYPD pizza. I promised him pizza when he was able to eat it. A month went by and we returned.  We got the same waitress. Again she was kind . I asked her for her name. Fabienne  she said but likes to go by Fabbi. We went back and she was not there but we stood anyway. The server that day was blah. We were going grocery shopping one day and I went in to see if she was there.  By chance she was so we decided  to stay. The day Fabbi no longer works there is the day we stop going. She is a great fabulous  person, server and does wonders for the restaurant.  If she's not there we will not stay. After all my babbling all I wanted to say is: Fabbi is a caring , loving , funny person. She makes you feel comfortable and  always makes my bad day better. Sincerely  The Guebaras"}
{"text":"After responding by yelp regarding a bad experience I got a phone call from a District manager.  She was awesome!  She thanked me for my feedback and handled the phone call with exceptional customer service. She was kind enough to tell me she would send me a gift card the following day.  I will go back and give them another go around!!  Thanks  I started this review appx a month ago and still have never received anything from the gal who called so maybe I was mistaken on the customer service again.  Why would you go to the trouble of calling individuals who take the time to complain, boast about your customer service and then not follow through.  I guess it starts at the top and trickles down."}
{"text":"First time here, we ate outside because is was nice out. Tables were clean, and not really busy (it was 1pm). Food took about 25 minutes to get to the table. We got Vinny's favorite. Craig was our server, he was nice and filled out waters constantly, brought us napkins, parmesan & didn't overly bother us."}
{"text":"Pretty great lunch specials- I got a slice of pizza and a salad. Pizza had a nice crunchy crust and the salad was fresh. It filled me up but not so much that they had to roll me out. Customer service was pleasant and quick to bring everything out. I would return for sure."}
{"text":"We went in to NYPD pizza for lunch  since I always hear the commercials on KTAR. The lunch time posted on the menu board was not accurate and have been changed. Not really a big deal but the server was very rude about this and just provided terrible overall service for the rest of lunch . She got our drinks and then sat down with other employees at a table as they ate lunch and talked about inappropriate things within our earshot. She would get up from time to time to check on us and then go back to doing  whatever she was doing with her coworkers as if we didn't really exist. Although I did enjoy the pizza particularly  the Wall Street and the bread knots were good. I'm not going to spend my money in a place that does not treat me well. I am not snobish and expect to be treated like a king or something just treat me like a human being."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Also had the  antipasto salad which was excellent and perfect for sharing.  Attentive service made for a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Out of all the pizza places I have tried so far this is by far my favorite. I used to like Rosati's Chicago style pizza but they have declined in customer service and in the kitchen unfortunately. So far you guys are in the lead and are winning at all the pizza places I just wish you guys were a little cheaper. Other than that you guys are great! Never had a problem yet."}
{"text":"Decent pizza, the sauce is kinda sweat which isn't my favorite but the toppings are fresh. The bad part about this place is the service.  I ordered a pizza on a Monday night and had to wait an hour and a half for it, and that was to pick it up. It's also a little pricey if you don't have any coupons."}
{"text":"i tend to be pretty picky about pizza and wasn't expecting much from this place. so i was shocked how good the pizza was here! would go back for sure! great service!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered a 10-inch pizza with breaded eggplant and artichokes.  It was soooo good!  This pizza definitely reminded me of home!  Shoutout to my Yelp friend Ebony W.  It was her check-in that sparked my curiosity to try this spot :)  Ooh and they have locations throughout the valley.  I will have to try the Scottsdale location next!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's just this location, but I did not see ONE DROP of tomato sauce on ANY of the pizzas in this restaurant, so I walked out and will not come back. Yes, they make \"white pies\" in New York, but only as a special order. In New York City where I'm from, the sauce is probably the MOST important ingredient and constitutes as much of the pizza as the cheese or the crust. So all this phoney baloney about this pie being like NYC or the East Coast is BULL!"}
{"text":"After working all day I decided to grab a pizza on the way home tonight for dinner. I called in my order at 6:57pm and was told by the lady on the phone it would be 25-30 minutes. I thought ok I'll stop next door and buy some new work pants while I'm waiting since I was only 5 minutes away at the time.   I walked into NYPD at 7:30 thinking my order would be ready, but was told it wasn't done yet. The girl at the register asked the kitchen how long till my pizza and garlic knots were ready. They told her 2 minutes, I thought ok since she offered me a soda while it was being finished.    I stood there, drinking my soda, until 7:51 when she finally rang up my order and I was on my way. Really?  54 minutes to make a pizza and some garlic knots, and there were only 5 tables with guests at them during this time. To be fair though, I am not sure how many to go orders they had though, but this was an extremely long time to wait, with no communication from them on what was going on, for a pizza.   The pizza and garlic knots were extremely good tasting and I liked the flavor they had. Thin crust and nice sauce, not sweet but just right. While I would like to say I would be back soon, I don't think I feel like waiting another hour for a pizza."}
{"text":"I had a coupon from the retail me not app fora a 16\" two topping pizza and 24 wings for $24.99.  The coupon was good untile 03/15/2014. I called in the order and asked if they were still accepting the coupon, just to be sure. The gentleman on the phone then asked Brittany, who stated that they were still accepting the coupon.  When I went to pick up my order I was told they could not accept the coupon because it was not for their location.   The price was then $44.  I would NEVER have paid that much money for pizza and wings.  The gentleman who took the order kindly told Brittany that he took the order and told me that they would accept the coupon.  Brittany still would not accept the coupon.  I was then told they had another deal going they could give instead.  This deal took a mere $4 off of my order so I was still paying a little over $40.  I could understand if the coupon listed specific locations, but it did not, and was listed under the Alameda Crossing section of the retail me not coupon section, not any of their other locations. Because the manager stated they would accept it at the time I placed my order, I feel like they should have honored the coupon.  Needless to say I will not be returning to NYPD pizza."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now.  While the food is 5 stars, no question, the service at this NYPD location was almost comically bad the last time I went.    Service: when they're slow, it's good service and the staff is friendly.  When they're busy, you are on your own. May the odds ever be in your favor, man. Go here - just not on a Friday night. If they look busy, just leave.  (People seem to know this already - I think last night they turned away more business than they sat.)   One poor family had small children, made reservations, and still sat ignored for over 20 minutes before coming to the front to ask for a few glasses of water. The table next to us placed their orders and got their food before the table next to them got a drink - and they had all arrived at the same time.  Food: consistently delicious.  The bruschetta (both appetizer and pizza) is fresh and flavorful, and I've never had a bad crust here."}
{"text":"Look at dat big, thin, floppy, cheesy, New York pizza. Like the kind on TMNT. Cartoonishly good.  NYPD is our go-to for pizza delivery. Pies are consistently on point, easy to order online, always fast and friendly delivery.  My husband and I have tried a lot of the nearby NY style pizza places in the Chandler and surrounding area and NYPD on the 101 is our clear winner. Personally, I'm a fan of all sorts of pizza varieties, but my husband, having grown up on the east coast, is a diehard for that real east coast style - big thin, floppy, foldable, and most importantly, executes that ideal sauce/cheese/pepperoni ratio. This location nails it.  As a bonus, leftovers from here heat up really, really well. Lemme go ahead and tell you my trick for perfectly reheating pizza at home. Microwave for a minute and thirty seconds. This will quickly get the pizza gooey again. Immediately put the slice on a hot, dry pan for 45 seconds. This will remove any moisture under the crust from the microwaving and re-crisp the bottom. Put your oven on high broil and hold the pan with pizza under the coils for 20 seconds or more to get that hot n bubbly fresh-out-the-oven surface. BOOM just as good as the night before. You're welcome.  Have been ordering from here for years and will continue! Thanks for existing, NYPD."}
{"text":"mmmmmmm  Food:  Pizza, cheese sticks, garlic knots, chicken parm... it is all so very, very tasty.  I purposely order too much so that I can enjoy the leftovers the next day.  Service:  The service is good.  Sometimes they get a bit busy and the server doesn't come by for a while.  Since the restuarant is very open you can see that it is because they are working with other customers and not off goofing.  Usually someone else will come by and see if you need anything when the wait staff gets over-occupied.  Convenience:  This location is in a shopping area with tons of ample parking so it makes it very easy to get in and out of without hassle."}
{"text":"Decided to give them another try. Food was tasty as always. This time, the service was much improved. =) On this trip, the manager did come by and check on us.  I did want to add that I was in contact with the district manager after our last visit with horrible service. He thanked me for the feedback, and said he would send us out a discount. To date, no discount received."}
{"text":"For this Buffalo, NY transplant; the Upstate-Style Wings and Cheese Pizza slices I got were the closest thing to flying into Buffalo and Manhattan, respectively! Good service and very legit food. Had a good local beer, NYPD Uptown Amber Ale, that is brewed specially for this restaurant. Boyfriend liked his meatball sub too."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent. Had a decent pizza there so tried again a couple of times. 3 strikes your out! Pizza was undercooked doughy not thin. Actually tasted like when you buy a jar of pizza sauce & pills bury dough & make your own. Wife says very disappointing! I agree"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!  Ordered two regular pizzas and one gluten/dairy free pizza.  All parties were over the moon with the taste of the pizzas.  The gluten free crust is one of the best I've ever had.  And they have Diaya cheese!"}
{"text":"This place is normally gold when we come here but tonight the service was just lacking and we enjoy a crispy pie and it wasn't done enough. We arrive with another foursome but there was plenty of seating, not busy at all and they had plenty of staff, not sure why our server wasn't there when needed. We took our son out, whom we don't get to see too often, so I was really disappointed in taking him here.  I have to be honest my wife didn't feel the service was as bad as I felt it was but I am basing it on previous times and how attentive they have been in prior visits, plus she just feels the sun rises and sets on this place and they can do no wrong.  The pie was ok, it will be better left over when I get to cook it to my liking. One more thing we had against us is that we were sat by friends of the establishment because all the servers were hanging out by their table shooting the bull, that's how we were able to get a hold of our server to refill our drinks."}
{"text":"Pre-Review Note to New Yorkers: We KNOW. We GET IT. There is no good pizza outside of NY. I agree. Moving on...  I am a true NY'er (Strong Island represent!) and a true pizza snob. I usually dislike all pizza that isn't made in New York. But actually, I'm kind of down with this place. So it isn't anything like NY Pizza. Big deal. The overall food and service is still pretty good.  I like NYPD Pizza because you don't have to order pizza in order to have a good meal. The salads are great. My fave is the Chelsea Salad. The Italian Wedding Soup is also very good. The pastas are pretty good and I'm not really into tomato sauce.   The only thing that is truly disappointing is the dessert. They make Gennaro Zeppolis - which are like my favorite thing ever - but at NYPD the zeppolis are kind of hard and stale and not delicious and fluffy like in NY. So boo for that.  The Pizza is okay. Maybe even very good. Yes, New Yorkers are going to hate on it and call it crap, but the rest of you should go and enjoy.   Tell them Jenny from the block sent you."}
{"text":"If you're old enough to remember Gomer Pyle this ones for you...  SURPRISE, SURPRISE, SURPRISE! There's great pizza on the West Siiiide. I've been avoiding the NYPD Pizza next to Pei Wei well because it's NYC pizza which usually in my experience means sog city doughy center. Plus it's next to Pei Wei & I love me some Pei Wei. However on a trip to get my taxes done & in an effort to apease my hubs whom loves pizza & wings I ate at NYPD Pizza & LOVED it. They have the best slices deal for lunches & you can get a lunch size portion of wings (6). Just the best deal ever & oh so tastey. The wings were spicey & tangy with out being too vinegary in flavor. No idea how they accomplished that but kudos chef. We'll be back with the fam in tow this weekend. Bringing the teen & his grandma. Should be fun! Thanks NYPD Pizza you're the bestest NYC pizza in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"I've been eating as one or another branch of NYPD since we moved to the Valley 13 years ago. Funny thing, there's an NYPD Pizza on Long Island where I ate whenever I was in the neighborhood, before I moved here. I hoped that these two were related. I still don't know if they are, but they're both great.  Tonight, 7/10/14, we went with a Groupon to NYPD for dinner. Our server was Lourdes. She greeted us with a big smile and asked us if we knew what we wanted to drink. Our beers were there in a New York minute. I had the Strawberry Fields Salad, besides strawberries it had apples, almonds and blue cheese in a light vinaigrette over mixed greens. It was delicious. I didn't leave a leaf or crumb of blue cheese.  We can never decide on pizza together so we always get a large and go 1/2 & 1/2. My half had the Bianco with Spinach, hubby's had meatballs & olives. I think he adds olives so I won't sneak in and eat his share after we're home.   We had 3 slices out of the pie and hubby was trying to cut another slice for me, when the pizza pan tipped over and went SPLAT on the floor.  A lovely young woman, who I think was the manager, was there in seconds picking up the mess. She offered a new pizza in 8 minutes. No problem. About 10 minutes later a new pie showed up and I had my second slice. We finished eating, paid and left.   Not only was the food good, but the service was outstanding. Offering us a new pizza was very kind and we appreciate it. Your food and service has won our loyalty. Thank you all at NYPD very much."}
{"text":"Not bad, but definitely not my first choice. If I were to eat pizza in the restaurant, then this is a good choice. But there are better choices for take-home pizza."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and have had delivery several times. I have never had a bad meal. The pizza is top notch and salads are fresh. Tonight had spaghetti and meatballs delivered and the portion is huge. The meatballs are tender and the sauce is great. Wife had SOHO pizza salad and loved it. Thanks again for another great meal."}
{"text":"This location just opened a relocate from 83rd Ave and Union Hills...the staff changed some and the ambiance is lacking the intimacy the other location had....but the food is always been good as well as the service!  Come by and have a pie!"}
{"text":"Was impressed . . . had the thick crust (it wasn't extremely thick) - was very good! Plenty of toppings!"}
{"text":"Went and ate in about a week ago the place is nice and clean  ,the pizza was delicious but the only thing I didn't like was there drinks do taste a little wierd"}
{"text":"I've tried a few times. It's so close, and not as busy as Orgenos ( I know why) service is iffy. Had good had pretty bad.  I ask for pizza well done I don't consider it even done. I'd be afraid if it cooked normal.  2 stars because the garlic knots are usually pretty bomb (except the time they were cold) keep trying...."}
{"text":"Wow the manager? I think up front is horrible. Made me wait at lunch hour (when I'm in a hurry) to move tables when he had plenty clean ones, then sat me at a wet seat. I got up and wiped and moved to other side, he said and did nothing. Server was nice but slow. Got old pizza I waited awhile for. Manager was back and in my face to clear table when I was trying to leave. No customer service, he needs a new job."}
{"text":"The servers are friendly and quick. We were seated and waited on! Pass on the zucchini. I can make better at home. Their garlic knots are delicious and their Pizzas were excellent."}
{"text":"I've been trying all the gluten free pizza in the area and this one is by far the best. Crispy crust, excellent toppings and tremendous flavor. Being from Chicago, it is hard to admit that this ny style pizzeria is phenomenal! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"YUMMMMMMY!!!  I love their bruschetta! It comes shaped like it was pressed into a cylinder and it reminded me of a Tartar I had at a fancier restaurant.  Very unique presentation.  The flavor - even better! The perfect mix of tomatoes and all the right spices!  I love pineapple on pizza, and I'm tempted to think they aren't canned pineapples here.  I suspect they use fresh pineapple because they were big and juicy! That's how pineapples are best!  Now, if the service matched the food, it definitely would have been a 4 star experience.  I'll definitely go back, but I would not ask for the same server again!"}
{"text":"I recently was unhappy with a delivery experience but I spoke with her and she made it up to me I will definitely be coming back. I am happy they cared enough to contact me and take care of the problem.   Thanks again."}
{"text":"Great regular pizza, horrible gluten free pizza. I don't want to judge this place too harshly on something that's not what the restaurant is all about but it's important for people seeking gluten free pizza to know. If I were them I wouldn't even carry this product at all. The dough is so flat and has a really weird after taste. Most places seem to use the same frozen rounds and they just don't cut it. I know GF will never replace pizza and there is only so much you can do but I really challenge this place to come up with a mix and bake fresh made pies. If I can do it in my home anyone can do it. The demand for GF alternatives is only growing and if you can have an edge on something like that it would set you apart from others. Maybe the owners should just try the GF crust and see what I mean. For having such amazing regular pizza they should at least try to put out a better quality product."}
{"text":"The closest thing I've found to good pizza since I moved to Arizona. I grew up in NY so I consider myself a bit of a pizza snob. I had very low hopes when I ordered from here. Every other local place had been very disappointing. The delivery was very quick. The pizza was pretty great. Their upstate (buffalo) wings were also true to NY. The only reason I dinged them a star because their prices. While you do get a lot of food and great pizza almost $40 for pizza and wings is way too much. I'll be ordering from them again. But I'll be ordering a small pizza and only saving wings for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Best Pizza ever! And the service was fantastic! Jessica was amazing best place and people we have been at in AZ."}
{"text":"Best pizza I ever had!!! Better than pizza I had in NY!!! Prices were good and service was excellent!! Can't wait to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza.  Crust is perfect, toppings cooked just right.  Whole family loves it.  Did take out so don't have anything to comment on for service other than the general manager was very helpful when our order was input incorrectly.  Highly recommend for awesome pizza!  We will return."}
{"text":"The food was good. The music sucks! The service was very, very slow. There are more employees than customers while we were there, but strangely very, very slow."}
{"text":"We walked into the location and were greeted and sat down. Promptly given drinks and our order taken, which was great. Our waiter was, Cody, was one of the best we have ever had. Very professional, ahead of our refills and our food was brought out in amazing time and his attitude was fantastic. Cody made the experience for us!"}
{"text":"Not a fan on NYPD and I'm from NY - this pizza is honestly NOTHING like NYC Pizza... Sorry - I have to be honest you know!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I are currently in the process of moving to Phoenix so trying to find some of the things that we love back home pizzas one of them we are both in the service industry husband is a restaurant manager we both believe that good service is just as important as good food. NYPD pizza has both I looked at a few other pizza restaurants before ordering from here. The other places got good food marks but bad service reviews we are currently staying in a hotel in unfamiliar with the area in the process of ordering online by the way very convenient and easy I called the restaurant to ask a question about an item Leo answered the phone very friendly great service after placing my order within a few minutes the manager from the restaurant called me because he was unsure about an ad on that I had and wanted to confirm he had it correct. to me that goes above and beyond instead of just assuming you called me to check it out the food was delivered within the 60 minute time frame I was given the driver was very friendly and most importantly had change we ordered pizza salad zucchini sticks and cannolis all in all after tip $42 yes a little pricey but great service and amazing food. you definitely get what you pay for here very much pleased and looking forward to ordering again thank you in YPD pizza for a great experience in Phoenix"}
{"text":"So glad this place is close to my house and delivers. Pizza is delicious and when DJ delivers its always seems fresh out the oven. Cheesy, melty, deliciousness."}
{"text":"Just called for delivery and I guess all the menu prices are not true. BBQ chicken pizza say 14 dollars on the menu. When I called it was 31 dollars. I'm sure it's good pizza but damn they charge a lot for it. Disappointed with the menu prices online and the actual price"}
{"text":"wow Superior service and quality of the food was excellent  Katie took excellent care of us and totally met our expectations  Arrived @5 pm and glad we did as it filled quickly  Lived here many years and everything has definitely improved and all employees and manager appear to be on top of their game Pizza was excellent and cooked perfectly and as ordered"}
{"text":"After having a bad day went for some pizza and the service and food was amazing ! Was treated with respect and a smile."}
{"text":"Always a great experience when we dine at the Surprise location. Courtney (shift mgr) is always delightful. Superior customer service with great food. What more could you ask for."}
{"text":"These guys are close to work, so it's an easy stop for lunch. Their pizza is good and they have a lunch special, 2 pieces of pizza and a soda, that end up being like $6.50 after tax. They have some interesting choices, a little different than what you'd see elsewhere. I like the pepperoni jalapeno.  The people who work there are excessively friendly. Everyone who sees you says hi when you walk in. It must be some corporate policy or something, but it's nice."}
{"text":"Never tried their pizza and have been traveling a distance to get real NY style pizza.  Too rainy to drive so I gave them a try.   OMG.  The cheese pizza has 100% New York DNA.  Thin crust, lots of cheese, pillowy edges.   Wow.  What a find!   Great combination with a Stella Artois beer.  That's like pizza heaven.  Had the zeppole sundae with vanilla ice cream.   It may be raining on the outside but I am smiling on the inside.    Thanks Zoe for taking care of us."}
{"text":"I can recommend the baked ziti and the bar-b-que pizza--they're amazing!  (But I'm sure everything is great...) Joey is a great manager also, and has great customer servic skills are great :) This is my first time here, and I'll be back many more times!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since they opened, and they have been consistently great- pizza, wings, sides, everything except the generic desserts, but we don't do much in the way of dessert, so who cares!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite order in pizza.  Their sicilian is very good and comes in quite a few vegetarian options which is always a bonus.  I have eaten in the restaurant a few times since my last review and the staff are very nice and attentive.  I highly recommend it for dining in, carry-out, or delivery.  Try: - Sicilian Joey's Favorite"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this NYPD on a regular basis for the past 2 years. I specifically go out of my way, passing 3 other pizza joints, not just because the pizza is really good but because service is impeccable. I typically sit at the bar and have to say each bartender that waits on me has always been courteous, friendly and quick on my order, always delivered with a smile. I highly recommend NYPD on Camelback for the relaxing yet fun atmosphere. If you're looking for great pizza and a nice place to relax, you will not be disappointed.  Not sure of the couple of negative reviews on here but apparently they have nothing better to do than whine. Speaking of, they have a great selection wine too."}
{"text":"Yelp pointed me to this place while on a business trip-- looking for good pizza in the area.  Kind of a mixed result.  The restaurant is located in a strip mall, sort of hidden in one of the back corners.  Walk in thinking fast food, but turns out it's sit down.  Why does it seem all the burger and pizza joints in this area are sit down-- odd...  Anyway, I got three slices.  Quality was ok-- a bit doughy and filling, I couldn't make it through all three.  Lots of free refills was a nice touch on a 105 degree day.  Staff were really friendly, and, oh yeah-- it was cheap!   Less than 6 bucks for more pizza than I could eat and bottomless coke.  So, great value, nice service, just ok pizza, though."}
{"text":"I go to this location a lot and they always give me the \"hey I remember you\" (: friendly staff, wait time is reasonable."}
{"text":"NYPD is at the end of shopping strip, and we probably drove past it a hundred times without ever noticing it was there. But some friends recommended we give it a try, so we did.  The decor is very cute; reminded us of New York City (which we love!) We started off with an antipasto salad that was delicious. For our entrees, the kids ordered pasta (which they both enjoyed and ate every bit of) while my husband and I shared a small meat lovers pizza. It was just \"ok\"; the dough was a little too salty and rolled too thin in the middle, which made it very soggy with all the toppings. Thinking maybe it was just undercooked, we sent it back to the oven. Unfortunately that didn't help much. We brought it to our server's attention and she was super sweet about it; called the manager on duty right over to our table and he offered to have another pizza made for us, which we declined. He kindly removed the pizza from our bill and gave us two complimentary desserts to go. The NY style cheesecake was good, but the limoncello cake was TO. DIE. FOR. I might go back just for that!"}
{"text":"I ordered a calzone on Sunday night (takeout).  I am hard to please when it comes to calzones.  By far and away the absolute I've had in PHX. So good, I had to try their pizza out the next night (delivery).  Delivery was quick and food was great!  My waistline isn't happy, but my tastebuds sure are!"}
{"text":"So let's talk New York style pizza. I grew up in Jersey, so I can't help shaking my head at places like NYPD for calling their pizza \"New York style\". Having grown up on the *real* stuff, I can tell you that NYPD is closer than others (say, for instance, Dominos), but not there yet.  Truth be told, I've yet to find a good New York style pizza anywhere outside of the east coast, so NYPD's effort should not be entirely dismissed. (The closest equivalent I've found in AZ to date is Venezia's Pizzeria.)  But back to NYPD. They get two stars for their pizza, a third star for a really delicious calzone (made the right way with real, quality ricotta), and they get that extra fourth star for service. Every time I've been, service has been on point.  At the end of the day, I've learned that to hunt down New York style pizza in the southwest might well be a fruitless effort. But what I do still hope to be able to find in a restaurant (regardless of type) is good service. And NYPD has always delivered.  If you haven't been, NYPD is a neat place to dine in and also an easy option for ordering out. I'd still recommend them, and I still intend to eat here on occasion, too."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday at 3pm. The pizza was flavorless, it was suppose to have mushrooms, but we only counted about 6 on the entire 14in. Also, the meat was not evenly spread. Some slices were pilled, while others had one or two pieces of meat. Lastly, there were about 3 other customers in the restaurant. Our waitress was very slow and we were her only table. We waved her over several times, she would nod to say she knew we needed her and then she would disappear. Eventually she would come over to take our request. Overall it was a bad experience, we wanted to try something new but we will not be coming back to this establishment. The only Positive we had was the dessert, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Fav local pizza place to go to. Good variety and my orders are warm when I pick them up"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and knots to the hotel, was quick and excellent!!  Will definitely order again next time I'm in town!!"}
{"text":"Ok so I ordered 2 MEDIUM pizzas for the co-workers at work, 1 a big Kahuna, and 1 Buffalo chicken style. Now don't get me wrong the pizzas here are good! But $45 good..... I thought there was going to be caviar or gold flakes on them! So in my opinion if you don't make a doctors salary, I would recommend going to Papa Johns and getting 6-7 pizzas for that price!"}
{"text":"My husband found this place bc I'm pregnant and can't eat pizza and I wanted salad... Wow, this place has awesome salad and pizza!! No need to order from any other pizza place now that we found this gem. Thanks"}
{"text":"It's also smaller place, pizza is good, it used to be better, I use to frequent their chandler location. Make sure to order their large artichoke dip.. I always order their veggie pizza. They can use a little more cheese on the pizza. Service is good, they kept checking on us. I would go there again"}
{"text":"I just walked out after waiting 20 minutes to be acknowledged. Our waitress with long red hair and sparkley eyeshadow who seemed VERY altered could not even communicate with us. She made us repeat our order several times walked away for about 10 minutes and then came back and made us reorder. We then got up and walked out without anyone noticing or caring. Sorry. Will not be returning soon."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the pizzas and salads that I have taken away from Nypd Pizza. But most of all... The last time I dined in the restaurant itself, our experience was excellent! The customer service was above and beyond!  It is very clear that a lot of training and care/consideration goes into running this business. We made an effort to reach out to the manager and tell him what great service the staff had provided and we were treated with a limoncello dessert...  D-Lish! Thank you NYPD!!"}
{"text":"Used to be great, but our last three pizzas have been so-so--seemed dry (overcooked? sat around too long?). And these prices are too high for so-so pizza."}
{"text":"I received a nice card from the manager with a certificate to have us for a meal.  Matter resolved to my satisfaction.  Thank you NYPD for restoRing my faith in you."}
{"text":"Great Lunch spot while we are here for a convention.. Cheap, fast and tasty.. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Absolutely in Love with this place. it has such a great atmosphere and of course the cruelty free Veganizza, so delicious it worth trying."}
{"text":"I love this NYPD! Had spinach salad and pizza today and both were great! My pizza crust was perfection. Thanks to Kendelle and her awesome team. I also ordered catering for next Sunday."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The service was quick, and very friendly and polite. Not only that, but the food is amazing! Their pizza is very good quality, their salads are fresh, and their desserts are very delicious. The atmosphere here is also very light and mood lifting.  I definitely will be coming back here, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a really good pizza place."}
{"text":"My husband likes the pizza. I ordered pasta primavera. Tasted very fresh however it had no real flavor. Since we carried out it doctored myself."}
{"text":"Garlic knots... Need I say more?! Not only are their pizza and salads amazing but they have the best garlic knots I've ever had! Even if you just go in there for dessert, it doesn't get much better than the Zeppolis! The prices are great - and you can get a single slice of pizza or a whole pizza, this place is 10 times better than Domino's, Pizza Hut or any other delivery pizza place! Get the garlic knots, i'm not sure if I forgot to mention it, but they're amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been to 5 or 6 all across the valley and have never been disappointed. Some of the best New York style pizza in town.   Lunches are very reasonable. Can get pizza by the slice or order a whole pizza also. Also some good salads... I like the Greek with balsamic vinegar..   Lunch prices are great. Pizza and Salad for $6.00 plus cost of a drink. Better than any fast food. Can take out or eat in...   Want a dessert, try the cooking and ice cream options. If you have room after your pizza.   Would make this my regular pizza place if I had one closer to house..   Need a lunch place. Want a slice and drink.. Give it a try. Don't think they will disappointed."}
{"text":"The first visit to this location for take out was great. Unfortunately tonight was not so great. After waiting an hour for a delivery just 2 blocks away resulted in a cold pie. When I called the restaurant the employee offered another pizza delivered in another hour or a coupon. Hmmmm. Really I learned my lesson about chain restaurants. My fault for mediocre expectations."}
{"text":"We had gone here once prior to the new location( we used to go to the one on union hills). In my previous review, I had said that we were willing to give it another chance. We came on a Saturday night around 5:10. We ordered a house salad, pizza and pasta. The server said the salad would be out shortly and the other items would take about 25 minutes. It took 25 minutes just to get a salad, and the server did not come around to refill drinks or check on us. We then got pizza about 10 minutes later. We were in the middle of the pizza when the server asked us if we wanted to have it boxed (we were chewing our pizza) and had not received the pasta. However, we were getting full and didn't really need the pasta at this point. We asked for the check and and said please take the pasta off the bill because we never received it. The manager then came out and apologized in a very brief way that I did not feel was sincere. We ended up getting a to go pasta to take home and off our bill. We waited 10 minutes for the bill and finally my husband had to track the server down to pay. since this was not the first time with major service issues that have yet to be worked out, we will not be returning. It's unfortunate because the pizza is good."}
{"text":"Order to go and order was incorrect. They did give us a complimentary cheese pizza. It was ok pizza, but have had better"}
{"text":"Great pizza loved they split the pizza into 2 choices. Service was great waiter Andre was very well versed on the menu and loves his products. He sampled me beer at no charge and the in house brews wear very good fresh with nice full body flavors. I would come again."}
{"text":"I thought I had already updated my review to 5-stars but apparently I hadn't! My favorite thing about any place I go to eat is consistency ... Good food every time & good service every time. That's what I find whenever I go to NYPD pizza!  In my previous review, I mentioned how great their lunch specials are, but I soon came to find out that they have various great happy hour specials as well. $1-some for a slice of cheese pizza & only a little bit extra for toppings? Perfect when you work close by or are in the area! ... I would even make the drive since it has gotten to the point that I only get pizza from NYPD.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As a native New Yorker, I was so looking forward to this, but it really let me down.  Pizza was underdone and bland ... and wouldn't kill anyone to rev up the oregano ... I might try them again (maybe not), but in any event, they need to step up their game ... maybe take a trip to Brooklyn to see how it's really supposed to taste?"}
{"text":"Used to always be awesome and worth the high price, but lately the quality has really dropped. I have been disappointed with 2 of the last 3 pizzas I got.  Mostly the topping have been really skimpy and usually the sauce is very very light.  -See the pic"}
{"text":"Love the new location, been coming for years and no complaints. Hector at the bar was amazing. Make sure to say hi to Tori, and if you happen to see a fiery blonde lady smiling and talking to everyone, make sure you say hi to Nikki, the chief entertainment officer!!!"}
{"text":"This is as close to NY style pizza you will find in any other part of the country. The prices are good and you get a good slice of pie. I liked it a lot. I went for lunch had a calzone that cost $4.99 and it was very good. Sausage, peperoni, onions, mozzarella and ricotta cheese. Highly recommend it. Kids eat free after 4 on Wed."}
{"text":"I ordered from the McDowell location on several occasions. No issues. I just called to order and they were adamant, and a bit rude about my house not being in their boundaries. I can't get delivery from a place 2 miles away"}
{"text":"At first I wasn't feeling the waitress, I tried making a Harmless joke about my ID and she looked at me like I was committing a crime. The pizza is alright nothing special. The place is your average pizzeria with average customer service."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have ignored NYPD Pizza for the past few years. I think I subconsciously thought I was going to get arrested or something.  I must have walked/driven past this place at least 200 times without a second thought of going in until last week. The joke is on me.  Taking the sister, her hubby and the kiddies for dinner in Central Phoenix and finding a restaurant we would all like was a challenge and thanks to Oregano's having a 2 hour Saturday night wait - which is par for the course - we ended up here.  NYPD Pizza and a 20 minute wait?  We're sold.  Another must was a TV for the NFL playoffs which they showed in the small bar area. As for the interior, it very much felt like a neighborhood cafe with the interior brick facade and stringed lights criss-crossing the room.  Well, NYPD Pizza delivered and then some.  They liked their pizza, minestrone and garlic bread knot thingies.  The girls got kids sized spaghetti and meatball, a coloring paper menu and crayons.  I needed to overload on carbs for a big race the next day so I ordered pasta.  My baked ziti with sausage was absolutely delicious.  Having had that same dish at Oregano's, it is much better than what they serve.  If you're not a fan of cheese you probably won't like the ziti at NYPD.  But since I love cheese, it hits the spot.  I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference in water in the taste of their dough, but apparently the fact that they import their water from Brooklyn is a big deal.  Kinda pretentious if you ask me, but hey, I like the extra effort and I liked the fact that I did not get arrested."}
{"text":"We've visited several NYPD locations over the years and it is one of our favorite pizza spots!   I would typically rate NYPD 4 stars for the solid food and service. We recently moved out the San Tan area in Gilbert and so this location is new to us. The dining room is a bit small and doesn't feel quite as cozy as some of the other locations do - it is basically just a box-like retail space, hence the slightly lower rating.  That said, the food is very yummy! We almost always order the Cheesy Garlic Knots to start which are a nice way to tide over your appetite while you wait for the pizza. I'm usually surprised that they only give you one container of the marinara sauce with a 12 count of cheese knots, and also the sauce seems to be watered down. The server will generally give you an ETA on the pizza when you place your order and it is not generally shorter than about 20 minutes, so it is nice to have something to munch in the meantime. We've also ordered their buffalo wings several times which are delicious as well. The pizzas are NY style (obviously) with a delicious crust, flavorful sauce and great toppings.   They also have a variety of pastas available for those who don't want pizza - my grandmother loves the spaghetti and meatballs and I've had friends order the lasagna and chicken parmesan, all to good reviews.  DESSERT: We've had the limoncello cake, zeppolis, and cannolis, all of which are yummy. However, I tend to avoid the zeppolis most times because by the time dessert rolls around, we'll have had pizza dough as an appetizer (Garlic Knots), entrée (pizza) and dessert!   Service is generally nice and friendly, it can get a bit less attentive when they're busy. They do get VERY busy, particularly on Fridays and Saturdays. We've ordered carryout a few times from them and while they normally give a good estimate on the timeframe, the last time we were quoted 20-25 minutes. My husband arrived at the end of that timeframe and had to wait another 30 minutes for his pizza, which verged on ridiculous. However, this doesn't seem to be the norm so I don't hold it against them :)"}
{"text":"Love love the gluten free salad pizza! And my son loved the Sicilian pepperoni pizza. Always had great food here!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Great atmosphere and decoration. Great service, greeted/seated quickly and my waiter was great on all fronts.  Had the knots, brooklyn family pizza and buffalo wings. The knots were fantastic, warm with cheese melted over with alfredo. The wings had a buffalo sauce like no other buffalo sauce i've ever tasted, in a good way. It was bold but oddly sweet, I loved it. The pizza was absolutely fantastic. Plenty of toppings, not too greasy, superb dough/crust and topped off with delicious arugula(?).   Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I don't know about it's authenticity as a \"New York pizza restaurant\" but the food is pretty good and so is the service.  I thought the Sicilian pizza was a little on the expensive side ($19 for half which came out to about 6 square slices) but I haven't had Sicilian pizza enough times to know if the price is par with other places."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings for the prize. Great flavor! Wings were very good. Timely in the order."}
{"text":"NYPD Pizza was way better our second time around. I would definitely recommend going and would go again."}
{"text":"Decent slice of pie. Delivery is fast. Little bit over priced but the garlic knots are really good."}
{"text":"This is a delicious pizza place! My wife and I come here at least once every few months because the prices are great, service is great, and the food is great, too! They offer several sizes for their pizzas ... I love their \"Wall Street\" pizza, but really you can't go wrong with most of them.  I also really like their Zucchini appetizer.  They have great weekly specials, including two nights where kids eat free.   Definitely a great choice for families, and for anyone who just wants some tasty pizza.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"In the time since I sadly had to give NYPD pizza a single star for not having any gluten-free products available upon my visit, I've been twice more. Both times, as on my first visit, the food and service were outstanding.   I was also contacted by two members of management who were very apologetic about running out of GF items and who offered me a gift certificate for the inconvenience. I didn't accept it because I wanted my follow-up review to be untainted by the spectre of paid advertisement, but it was very nice of them to offer."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Stop by today for lunch and got a pepperoni, sausage drizzled with barbecue sauce. Unbelievable flavors! Definitely a pie of its own. The crust was amazing, who knew the New York water made all the difference. I will definitely bring the family back to this place. Great service but amazing pizza! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"We are regulars at this location and have never been disappointed. Service and food has always been very good. We think their crust is absolutely the best! We have had both Sicilian and regular crust pizzas and recommend both. Garlic knots and salads are also excellent! They also have kids eat free days too."}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely phenomenal! We ordered wings, pizza and the artichoke dip, all were very good. Reasonably priced as well. We will be back again."}
{"text":"What's to say about pizza or pasta lunch? It wasn't fantastic but it wasn't horrible either. I ordered spaghetti with sausage and a salad. The spaghetti was good. The sauce had the right amount of spice, as did the sausage.   I recommend the place for lunch, depending on what you're looking for. I recommend the garlic pizza knots. Those are delicious."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and love the Pizza. It's tough to find any pizza around here other than the standard chains. If you're sick of Dominos and want something that reminds you of a big city pizza, give NYPD a try.    If you order online, it says an automatic 1 hour wait. Go early, it's only around 30 and your pizza will be old and cold. I've read 45 - 60 minutes in the reviews but I've never waited longer than 30 minutes, ever.   Try anything on the Menu. It's all good."}
{"text":"In a pinch, this will have to do.  I usually prefer the mom and pop pizza joints as they have time and again proven they have better pizza.  We were in a time crunch and starving and this was the only feasible option."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, great Ceasar Salad and fabulous Mott Street pizza. Connor, our waiter, was attentive and friendly. We'll go back."}
{"text":"This was our first time ordering carry out at this location and we will do so again! Service was friendly and management followed up to be sure we were taken care of. The bartender even came out from behind the bar to offer us a beverage while we waited.  Once we were home with our order, we were not disappointed. Adding ricotta to our pie made for a nice bite and the ingredients tasted fresh and hot. We were advised to order two slices of limoncello cake because it was THAT DELICIOUS!  Great food and even better service!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, but can be a little on the pricey side for a family dinner. Garlic knots are pretty good, but the zepps were soggy and cold when we got them. I'd recommend eating here for lunch."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to this location last week and everything was amazing!  Both the food and service were exactly what I would expect (being a former server my standards are high)  Our server was Rexhina and the Manager Mike even stopped over to make sure our experience was stellar!!"}
{"text":"Just tried to order. Unfortuatly the highly populated area of 85251 is out of the deliver radius of ANY location this restaurant has to offer."}
{"text":"NYPD is by far the best pizza in Arizona! It's never a let down and well worth the extra couple of dollars you spend for a good quality pie.   I would like to address the service for this particular location. I was with a family of seven and the server did an outstanding job taking care of us. The teenagers were running her around like crazy. Each teenager probably required five refills of dr Pepper and lots of ranch for their pizzas.   The servers name is Celina and her personality was top notch for the industry. What a gem! She took our pictures, quickly refilled drinks and added an awesome sense of humor to our day!  Best service I've had in a long time. A message to her boss...I own a business with several employees and you have a rare find. Give that girl a raise! :-)  Thanks NYPD for being an awesome chain. Loyal customer here!"}
{"text":"Ok, first thing's first.  NYPD stands for New York Pizza Dept.  So this place calls itself New York Pizza Dept Pizza?  Isn't that kind of redundant?     I figured I had to give it a try, see if it lived up to a native New Yorker's standards.  My general rule is that when an establishment uses \"New York\" in its name, it just means they are trying too hard and are really nowhere near authentic.  \"New York Pizza\", \"New York Deli\", etc.  If you were really authentic, you wouldn't need to remind people in your name, your food would speak for itself.    I called and placed an order for pickup and was put on hold twice.  I was on hold longer than it took me to place the order.  Argh.     I ordered a plain cheese pizza, mozzarella sticks, and their \"upstate\" wings.  The same way I'm a bagel purist - plain bagel toasted with cream cheese is my benchmark - a plain cheese pizza is my benchmark for a pizza place.  No crazy toppings like pineapple or bbq chicken, I challenge you to find a New Yorker that puts that stuff on their pizza.  Also, what's the deal with \"upstate\" wings?  They can't just be buffalo wings?  Weird.  When I ordered the wings, the guy asked me if I wanted ranch with it.  In NY, buffalo wings come with bleu cheese dressing, not ranch. . .    As soon as you walk into this place you get that \"chain\" restaurant feel.  It's way too over the top, nothing authentic about it at all, you will never find a pizza place in NY that looks like this.  It's like Disney's interpretation of a NY pizzeria.  Have you ever been to the New York New York hotel/casino in Las Vegas?  This place would fit right in.    But the true test is the food, right?  My husband and I both thought the pizza was just average - I didn't like the dough and my husband thought it was too thin/crispy and not floppy enough, like it was trying too hard to be NY pizza.  It was certainly better than Pizza Hut or Papa Johns or Dominos if those are your only other choices.  No doubt, if this place was in Boston or Pittsburgh it would clean up.  But luckily here you have a multitude of choices.  The mozzarella sticks were also pretty average, and we both thought the marinara sauce was on the disgusting side - waaaay to sweet.  Marinara should be tomato-sweet, not added-sugar sweet.  The surprise of the night were the wings - just the right amount of spicy and very flavorful.  And to be honest, they were kind of sweet too, but we both thought that was an interesting twist.  And it was nice they provided celery with the bleu cheese, but it was not so nice that the celery was disgustingly rotten and almost made my husband vomit with one bite.  He did get a kick out of the fact that he could bend each piece in half without it breaking!    In conclusion, if you want truly fantastic NY style pizza in a truly authentic setting, Redendo's is right up the road from this location (at FLW and Raintree).  So if you're headed here, think to yourself, \"Self, you know what, Kristin S. recommended Redendo's right up the street, and Kristin S. is useful, funny, and cool!\""}
{"text":"Can someone PLEASE get these people a new phone! My boyfriend called in our order both times we've had pizza here and it seems to be this big ordeal just to get the girl on the other line to hear our order correctly. Each time they've added a whole extra pizza to our order that we never asked for. On top of that, we were told our pizza would be ready 30min, so we LEFT OUR HOUSE about 30 to 40minutes after placing our order. At that point we expected to have our pizza ready, if not coming soon after arrival. Low and behold, we were left waiting for another 20 for a lukewarm pizza that was less than exciting. Now, it wasn't terrible...but it wasn't the best either. Heck I'm sure it would have been a great pizza if it didn't taste like it sat under a heating lamp for the day. More than anything, if it weren't for their bumbling mistakes, I'm sure we'd be back more often."}
{"text":"The pizza here is truly mediocre. The crust is really bland and floury, the cheese and toppings oozed grease all over my plate, and the service was non-existent. I had ordered water to start off with, then nobody came back around to see what else I wanted. Also, the pizzas here take 30 min to cook, which is pretty ridiculous.   I have been to other places nearby that have much better pizza and that only take 10-15 min to cook.   NYPD: Sorry, but you fail at pizza making."}
{"text":"Honestly, I feel conflicted making this review because in the past, my experiences at NYPD Pizza have been standard.  Tonight, however, their food was disturbingly poor; so much so, that I feel compelled to write this review after avoiding reviews for years.  I ordered the Greek Salad because it sounded great, but what I received should not have been served, period, let alone slapped with the label \"Greek.\"  It was mixed greens, mostly iceberg lettuce, that was at the end of its life.  Nearly every leaf was brown around the edges or simply inedible.  Whatever.  The worst part were the elements of the salad that presumably made it \"Greek\" -- Kalamata olives, cucumbers, bell peppers, feta cheese, and onion.  I don't even feel particularly comfortable making those terms plural because what I received was literally 2 or 3 of the ingredients each in a large salad.  3 olives.  3 cucumber slices, which were BITTER, by the way, and had that soap taste.  I found only 1 slice of bell pepper.  ONE.  I won't blame the restaurant for this (although I should), but the feta was tasteless.  How could (feta) cheese be bland?!  I didn't try the onions, but that was the most abundant item on the list.  five whole slices of red onion!  hit the jackpot!    Either stop selling this horrendous excuse for a salad, or make it with ingredients that are fresh and ripe.  I would ask for y'all to include more than 1-3 of each ingredient, but that seems like a rather grandiose request when providing the paying customer with edible food is not a given.  I've never been this angry about a salad -- congrats, NYPD Pizza!"}
{"text":"Pizza Friday's is a weekly ritual at my house. So we chose to get one of our favorites, NYPD. I called and placed an order, they lost it. I had to call back and replace the order. They were friendly enough and the manager offered to fast track the order. We ordered 2 pizzas, 24 wings(there are 6 of us to feed), and a pizzookie. The wings were mediocre, pizza was good, and the pizzookie was burnt, crusty, and gross. There was no \"chew\" to the cookie. It was like trying to bite an old piece of crusty bread. We won't be visiting this location again.    UPDATE They sent us a voucher to revisit. We did and the pizza was excellent. We didn't get any wings or dessert this time. My aunt who only eats 2 pieces max, ate 3 and kept asking the name of the pizza place. We will just keep ordering pizza only since that is consistently above average."}
{"text":"I've been here 3-4 times since my last review, and just want to state I still very much enjoy the pizza here!  I was just here two weeks ago, and this time tried the dine-in experience with a couple of co-workers.  The dining area is not large, but we got seated after a 5 minute wait.  The service was good, and of course the pizza pies were delicious. Also tried a caesar salad, and it was also good, fresh ingredients, though a very basic caesar salad."}
{"text":"The moment I walked in it was NOT a friendly environment. The servers definitely lacked skills that are needed in the restaurant industry.     I sat watching a couple stand and wait in front of a empty host stand when there was a bunch of empty seats. I saw other people's experience be tampering with \" cups were drilled  on the floor and still given to the guests afterwards. Our food arrived sporadically, and when the pizzas did come out 1 was sent immediately back after discovering how soggy it was. Even after bringing this to attention, the crew lacked secrecy and addressing this issue and instead brought it up while our party was still there and the crew is noticeably looking back at us as they Converse. After all was said and done our bill was poorly compensated, manager never gave us her name and our terrible leftovers were never brought back to us as requested. This was a terrible experience for my out of state family. Next time I know to travel the extra distance to the 7th ave and McDowell location!"}
{"text":"Like my other review, I STILL love the garlic knots. This time trying the calzone."}
{"text":"We went on Friday at about 5:30, we sat on the patio because we had our baby in the stroller, though the inside is nice and big and I'm sure could have accomidated us. Our waitress April was very friendly and fast. The patio was not set up with drink menus but she quickly got us one.I ordered a zinfandel and the waitress brought me wwhite zin by mistake but when I said something she was nice about it and quickly fixed it. We had the garlic cheese knots which were ok, though the cheese seemed to just be a few slices placed on top, but it was fine because they were good. Then we had the bruschetta pizza which was delicious. LOTS of fresh basil which I love, usually if a pizza says it has fresh basil its only like 4 leaves. The crust was great too. The baby was too fussy for dessert but I will try a conoli next time. The rest of the staff that I interacted with was very nice and friendly. We had a great experience and will go back soon."}
{"text":"My friend LOVES this place, but I really don't get what makes it so special... cheesy garlic knots weren't good, pizza was over priced and the service was so so. I won't go again."}
{"text":"By far one of the worst flavorless restaurant pizza I've ever had !!! I think I've had better ones at Costco !!!! No flavor on the crust whatsoever and the tomato paste. It was just a very sad pizza overall.... (I had the Brooklyn  family ) bad bad bad"}
{"text":"Great pizza, could tell took time to make it. Fresh and perfect amount of sauce and cheese. A little burnt but still very good."}
{"text":"Unimpressive food and confusing service!  Took my family there today for lunch since my 2 kids are big Pizza fans and being from NY we thought it would be worth giving this a shot based on the NYPD name.  We started out with very confusing signage when you walk in allowing you to either wait for table service or order from the counter in back.  Being the positive person I guess maybe the signage was intentional and felt like I was looking at a NY Subway Map http://www.nysubway.com/map/index.html  If I was the owners of NYPD I would follow the KISS (keep it simple stupid) rule and just offer the walk up option (especially during lunch).  We walked in and since we had not been there before we waited up front for about 5 minutes with about 4+ employees in the back standing around just staring at us.  I finally gave up and walked in the back and asked for help and we decided to order at the counter after it was explained to us that we could order off menu at back.  After trying out 2 different flat soda's finally grabbed some ice tea and waited at the table for our food to come out.  Food came out in good time so that part was positive.  We ordered an eggplant sandwich, meatball sandwich and 2 pieces of pizza.   It's been a few years since we have been back to NY so my taste buds may be a little off but, in my opinion, the food quality was more of a AZPD (Arizona Pizza Dept) quality vs. NYPD - New York quality.  If you are up for ok pizza (good pricing) maybe give NYPD a shot and hopefully you have a better experience than we did.  Since it so close to Ray's Pizza I would recommend playing it safe and going to Ray's Pizza."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner and enjoyed every minute of it! The pizza was very delicious we ordered a Sicilian pizza with half cheese and Joe's favorite with jalapeños!!! Denyelle, our server, was one of the BEST servers we had in months.. she was very attentive, super nice and overall a good example of great customer service!"}
{"text":"I have been going to NYPD Pizza for years. This was my first time at the Tempe location. A modern, smaller establishment. The quality of the food was just as good as ever. WE had a half pie of Sicilian pizza. Being an ex New Yorker, we had a plain cheese pizza. I've been eating pizza for over 50 years. This was on of the best Sicilian pies I've ever eaten. NYPD has never disappointed me since we discover it years ago. Our waiter was friendly and informative about the tap beers they serve. I highly the Tempe location."}
{"text":"Oh NYPD Pizza. You seriously disappointed me.   My husband and I stopped in on Saturday around 1pm. We were seated quickly since the restaurant wasn't busy but it took us 15 minutes for a waiter to come by. FIFTEEN minutes. A different waiter dropped off two waters when we sat down, but other than that - no one even acknowledged us. We had to stop another waitress and ask who are waiter was - and she seemed super confused.   Finally Connor rolls around. Doesn't apologize for the wait - just seems nonchalant about taking our order.   We split the chopped salad and had a few slices of pizza. The pizza was fine but don't bother with the chopped salad - not worth $10 at all. I think we counted a grand total of 4 tiny pieces of sun dried tomatoes and 8 quarter pieces of cucumber.   We were never checked on during our dining experience until my husband was taking the last bite of pizza crust, Connor asked us how was the food. Really? Water was never refilled and extra napkins never appeared.   We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We enjoy their pizza, garlic knots and spaghetti.  It's our go to in a pinch and reasonably priced.  Great for kids and adults!"}
{"text":"My office orders in a pizza lunch from NYPD about every other month or so and I always do the ordering.  First off, everyone I've spoken to on the phone couldn't be more pleasant and helpful, even when we have tedious requests. Our most recent order was with Ryan but I can't remember the others' names. Second off, the pizza is always so fresh and delicious. We recently ordered their boneless wings which were a huge hit in the office and gone before the pizza. We've always tried a few different pastas and they've all been great. Lastly, the delivery is always prompt (with the exception of one time when the delivery driver got lost but we work in a confusing building and it happens).  I've never eaten/been in the restaurant but if the service and food are comparable to the catering orders we've placed, I'd highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was contacted by NYPD management who took the time to assist in resolving my previous issues.  It's still a bit pricey, but it is quality.  They have resolved the service issue and on my subsequent visit I was very pleased on all accounts."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I recommend the Calzones, they are massive and full of flavor. One of my few favorite pizza joints in Arizona."}
{"text":"Come here for the pizza... or the cheesy garlic knots... hmmm...  In all honesty... come for the cheesy garlic knots!!! I've never been disappointed and neither has any of my guests.  But really, the pizza is good too! I just happen to be so sidetracked by the cheesy garlic knots half the time that I have no room for the pizza! :("}
{"text":"The pizza was great! I have to say I was also surprised how fast the delivery boy made it to my door! Thanks for the speedy service Morgan!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a pizza place with gluten free crust. Delivery was too long of a wait so we drove to the restaurant. Super cute restaurant, absolutely great service, waitress was very attentive, friendly and funny.  We got gluten free artichoke dip, delicious!! I got the gluten free joes special which was yummy. The men got a large pepperoni pizza, talk about a BIG pizza. This place is awesome, 3 very satisfied customers."}
{"text":"The servers here are always super friendly. The food is delicious! They have lunch specials where you can get a slice + a salad or a slice + wings or a slice plus garlic knots.. I always get the bruschetta pizza. Their fall harvest salad is super yummy.. and finish it off with their zeppolis.. they are like donut holes dipped in powdered sugar and come with 3 dipping sauces (chocolate, raspberry and caramel).  Sometimes they are a little on the slow side so if you're in a rush you might be slightly disappointed in the time that it takes to get in and out. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"They are a tiny, but awesome pizza place! The wait time was a little lengthy, but it was worth it! Awesome food, awesome service and a little bit of a wait, but you should check it out."}
{"text":"So we went from 3 stars to 2.  NOT for the food.  The food is good.  The service??!?!?!?!?!?!!  We ordered lunch, and food was forgotten.  Crap happens, I understand that, so I immediately call.  The manager said he would refund the card we paid with for the cost of the food forgotten. (chicken on a salad).  So.....not make it right and bring the chicken?  So now my friend has some iceberg lettuce for lunch?  But **free** iceberg lettuce.  I asked \"that's what we do?\"  And yes, that's what they do.  I remarked that I needed to get off the phone so I could go order her lunch and they said \"ok\".  OK. I just would have expected our order to be delivered in full..eventually.  But not at all?"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Embassy Suites Biltmore and ordered a lot of food (pizza, wings, knots, and soda) all which was very good. They were kind enough to provide plates and plastic ware since we were at a hotel which I thought was convenient. Our lookout ended up falling asleep in the room while the rest of us went to the pool, and, as you would expect, delivery arrived and no one was answering the door. The kind lady waited for us to come back and we tipped appropriately for the extra trouble. Great service and good food."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in quite awhile.  The young woman on the phone taking my order was very outgoing. The pizza was hot and delicious.  Excellent all around."}
{"text":"This is this best pizza I've had since I've been in the Phoenix area! My family and I really enjoyed it. I don't typically like sausage on pizza and pick it off, but NYPD has really tasty sausage that is fully cooked. Delivery was prompt, professional and they even show you the pizza before leaving. We will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Took advantage of their Father's day offer of a free entrée. True to their ad, any entrée on the menu could be had. The ravioli was excellent, and the service provided by Mallory was exemplary. The staff here is very accommodating and work in concert with one another to make sure customer's have a pleasant experience. My only issue is it can take 45 minutes to get your entrée form the time it's ordered. I believe that is because they do a big takeout business, and can only cook so much at a time. This time it only took 25 minutes. Other than that, the food and service are both consistently very good."}
{"text":"Great pizza as always , awesome  service from James! Best waiter so far. He's right on it, never had to ask for anything."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Our server Jeff was on top of everything and was very attentive. We come from Chicago and had high expectations for their deep dish pizzas, and needless to say they lived up to our expectations. We ordered the vinny's favourite and it took a little time to come out, but it was well worth it in the end.   Definitely would recommend to my friends!"}
{"text":"Still one of the top three (two?) pizza joints in the entire valley.  However, suddenly some of the best French fries ever are gone?!  Boo.  Bring back the fries!  12 Aug 2017: Back @ NYPD.  Still no fries.  Sad!"}
{"text":"NYPD Pizza in the Camelback Colonade is a great little place for casual, no-fuss dining. The pizza is excellent, along with many of their pasta dishes. I have heard really good things about their cazones, but I have not ordered one yet do to the 20-30 minute prep time. The prices are reasonably cheap, and the service is friendly. Recommended."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time here and I'm giving 3 stars due to the fact that the pizza was good (although it was slightly undercooked on the bottom). As soon as we walked in you could see the chaos that was going on with the staff. There was nobody to greet us and it took a good few minutes before someone finally came and told us it'll be a few. It took some time to be seated although there was only 2 of us and there was a table for 2 wide open. The manager had no control of anything she actually looked way overwhelmed. Our server was nice but I noticed a lot of standing around with all the staff. Overall the food was good but they seem way understaffed and the management may as well have not been there. I will give this place another shot hopefully it goes better next time."}
{"text":"Any available slice is only what you will get. So if it's not what you like well too bad. I have never had somewhere tell me that they won't make what I want. I didn't even get to tell them how much pizza I wanted. I asked how big the dimensions were on the pizza I liked and they said nearly about the amount I was going to order. Why would you say no to a customer in the middle of lunch hour when your restaurant is busy. Poor management is what this sounds like to me. That place is nothing out of the ordinary. Just a floppy greasy pizza just like you get in NYC. I'm sorry but you just can't have a thriving business when you're refusing to make a pizza that is clearly in demand. A lot of the people who work here have sour attitudes and that's a killer when you bring repeat business to their restaurant. I'll tell you all I wanted was a Sicilian pizza which is a pan pizza but them being idiots is going to have them losing my business and my coworkers business as well."}
{"text":"Best pizza best service we loved this place kids loved this place great service Johnny didn't have to ask for anything . He gave pizza dough to my kids to play with while we waited for our pizza .Nice And cool atmosphere everyone was friendly and nice plus the bathrooms were clean ."}
{"text":"We have been regulars for less than one year.  The manager bought our pizza for us last night just as a thank you for being regular customers.  It was so nice and so unexpected!! Great place! Great service!! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Good service, pizza was overpriced for the poor quality pizza they are serving. Would recommend finding different place."}
{"text":"excellent pizza   ... truly thin crust and totally New York isn.   Others speak that its expensive, however, you get what you pay for.  The quality etc and the service by  ( Courtney) was absolutely fabulous.    Our hotel told us that this was the best pizza around and we totally agree"}
{"text":"Dear Yelp: Why can't there be a 3.5 star rating?  I wanted to give this place 4 stars, but will have to wait for another visit to bump it up.  I have never been here before, so I consulted with my fellow Yelpers for their input.    The service was quick and prompt.  Our waitress was friendly and on top of things.  I was impressed by the selection of beer, although small, with an offering of Alaskan Amber Ale...mmmm.  We decided to keep things simple this trip.  12 wings, medium flavor, one large margherita pizza with garlic on 1/2.    GOODS: I LOVE the mozzarella that they use!  I have never tasted cheese this cheesy or this good on my pizza.  NO JOKE.  The wing sauce was also delicious and they provided you with a perfect amount of sauce to cover the wings.  AND, the ranch was NOT watered down, which I am traditionally used to.  BADS:  The parking lot sucks.  We had to park across the street from their main lot to find a spot.  Also, the tomatoes on the pizza were unripe.  Our pizza was soggy in the center, perhaps from the tomato juice during the cooking process, and it made for bad leftovers in the microwave the next day.  So, with the combination of the both, I will definitely say that I shall return to give them another sampling in due time, and perhaps bump up that star to where I think it should be in the back of my mind."}
{"text":"I remember when NYPD put out some killer wings and decent pizza.  Ordered 18 Hells Kitchen wings and Da Works pizza.  The pizza was cold and I ended up with 24 wings.  12 were Hells Kitchen and 12 were medium.  Not only were they wrong but the wings were also cold and the hells kitchen were not the same as before.  My bill was 44 bucks for a large pizza and 18 wings.  A bit absurd when the pizza and wings are cold and unsatisfying.  Even if they were warm I can just tell the quality that NYPD is putting out is not the same.  Never again for me.  If I want mediocre pizza and wings I will pay mediocre prices at a different chain."}
{"text":"Love everything from the salad to the Hell's Kitchen wings and the best pizza. Ordering take out is a breeze and dining in is great too. A little bit pricey but superior quality. They have a good happy hour too!"}
{"text":"Our go to pizza place. Love all the different pizza flavors as well as the salads. Service is usually pretty decent as wel"}
{"text":"This place has an amazing atmosphere. Could hang here all day. The food was hot from the over and a noticeable effort was made to deliver food to the entire table at once and in a prompt manner. Excellent service and friendly staff will have me coming back later."}
{"text":"Oh NYPD, two steps forward- three steps backwards. I only wish your pizza wasn't good, it would be easier to never go back.   I placed a phone takeout order and was quoted 20-25 minutes for my large pizza and garlic knots on a Sunday night. I get there 35 minutes later and walk in and wait to be acknowledged at the take-out area. There were five employees behind the counter, all facing the kitchen line. No one could be bothered to look towards the entrance to maybe greet customers. After five long minutes a guy turns his head to the side and yells out \"Hey- my man!\" Which apparently is NYPD speak for \"Good evening- how may I help you?\"  The man never asked if I needed help- and instead went back to staring at the kitchen staff working away.   Finally after ten minutes a different employee saw me and asked if I needed help. I have him my name and paid for my food. He silently walked away and went back to staring at the kitchen crew. It seemed like there was zero leadership working. It looked like a member of management was back in the kitchen- working hard helping make wings and other food- which I admire, but there was no one in front of house- which was a disaster.   After 55 minutes, my food was given to me. Not one word was mentioned as to why it took so long, or God forbid an apology offered. Just \"here's your pizza\". Now I realize it's a first world problem when pizza is taking 55 Minutes, and I also understand sometimes things happen. What I cannot understand is the complete and utter lack of customer service. If things are going wrong in the kitchen- or they are behind, etc- just say so. We are all human. I'd get it. But say SOMETHING. To act like it's normal that a simple order takes an hour while everyone avoids talking to customers is insane.  If it is so busy the manager has to help cook, then someone needs to be designated as front of house- and meet the needs of customers. It is inexcusable that five employees are standing with their backs to customers and no one can be bothered to greet people and expedite orders.  If things have gone so bad in the kitchen- then someone needs to take care of the customers and explain what's going on- and apologize. Offer a free dessert maybe. Or comp something. Do anything, other than ignore your customers and when they finally get their food act like everything is normal.   It doesn't matter how good the food is, if it's a total nightmare to try and get it. The level of apathy is off the charts here. This NYPD location is where customer service goes to die. Skip it, you'll thank me."}
{"text":"Not only the best calazones in town but I think the best wait staff as well! Tenille waited on us last night and I was thrilled to find out she remembered our drink preferences from a previous visit!"}
{"text":"Cesar salad, wings very yummy. Pizza could have cooked just a little longer. Staff friendly and helpful. we love coming here when we are in town."}
{"text":"Went in with a coupon for a free meal and the guys were very friendly and recommended the chelsea salad which was very yummy.  They even gave me the large size.  I will be going back and trying some other salads.  Their salad on a pizza sounds interesting.  I like that they are local and have gluten free options and they said they make their dough fresh daily."}
{"text":"Wow this place happens to be one of mine and my husband's favorite places to go eat pizza. The place is always clean and well kept. The service we get is awesome and the food is always fresh when we get it and oh so delicious. If the price was a little lower I would come to this place almost everyday. Would definitely recommend it for families to come and even romantic for a date."}
{"text":"To start off, I will say the food here was wonderful. I got a 14 inch pizza which was a lot bigger than I thought it would be and it had green peppers and onions, my boyfriend got the 12 inch joeys special. Both of these pizzas were delicious. We also had gotten the garlic knots with cheese and they have some killer marinara sauce. Everything was fresh and delicious. Their pizza crusts are also awesome.  As for the bad part. The service sucks and I would highly recommend doing a pick up and bringing it home if you go later on in the day (after 5 pm). Our waitress was your typical 19-21 year old college chick who would rather spend time talking to the other servers in the back and we barely saw her. I finally got sick of waiting for her to come get my card to swipe it so I brought it to the front counter and the manager came over to take care of it and who comes running out to take care of me? To say the least, the tip was not good.  Also, my boyfriend got a beer. The beer expired in 4/2008. They REALLY need to check their stock. Then his second beer got to foamy and spilled and the waitress came over with our food and we mentioned the beer spilled but she never got us additional napkins or anything.  So again, awesome food and kudos to the pizza cookers but the service sucks otherwise. I went later on in the day however so the daytime crew (before 5 pm) may be better.  As for the restaurant itself, it's nice inside. Our table was wobbly which was kind of annoying but no big deal and was fairly  clean. The bathroom had no hand soap in it though but otherwise it was really clean.  Also, go for the nights that have deals on the pizza, we got 1 pizza and then the second was 50% off. This is for mon/tues nights."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum.  Everything here is delicious.  My husband and daughter usually split a \"Da' Work\" Sicilian, and I split a Hawaiian with my other daughter.  We love their garlic cheese knots.  Great food.  Great pizza.  We drive 10 miles, just to eat here."}
{"text":"Just got back from here. Kids eat free on Wednesdays and Sunday and there is currently a great groupon deal. Had to pay for kids meal because it can't be combined with the groupon. Still a great deal. Get on it!   The pizza is awesome in person. Carry out won't do it justice unless you live super close. Fresh cheese, tasty sauce and crust. The meatballs are great on pizza, as is spinach. Pineapple is just okay. No fresh pineapple like they use at Nello's, just canned tidbits. The winner is truly the crust. It tastes so unique and they use imported water from NY in the dough! The large salad would be great for 2-4 people to share and more cost effective than individual side salads. The garlic knots are where it's at! Nom nom. Throw some Alfredo on those and you will be in carb heaven.   Service is great and the atmosphere casual. Drink service and ordering was fast tonight but we had to wait quite a while for our garlic knot app(30 min). Please note that children's menu \"pizza bites\" are really a big 'ol slice of pizza that they cut into a few strips. Overall, our favorite pizza place in East Mesa/Gilbert. Very close to San Tan Village."}
{"text":"Worst delivery experience of my life.  I called and ordered 3 SMALL pizzas.  Over $60 for delivery. I called back 2 minutes later to cancel.  Was hung up on twice.  Called again and was put on hold.  I waited 5 minutes.  The girl came back on and asked again if I would hold. I told her I was cancelling my order.  She said OK.  It was cancelled.  Called Pizza Heaven and got the same order $15 cheaper.  Checked my checking account. NYPD still charged me.  I want a refund for pizza I never received."}
{"text":"It was my first time today!  Overall cleanliness: clean. Decor was cute and fancy-ish! Candles lit up the place.   I walked in and was immediately greeted and sat down. The place WAS empty at 430pm. Haha   Our server was Justin. He attended to all of our needs promptly, accurately, and without complaints. He was pretty funny. Good service. The other employees were really nice and funny :)  So, let's talk about the food. We ordered: 1. Hell Kitchen Traditional Wings (6) 2. BBQ Boneless Wings (6) 3. Chicken Caesar salad 4. Wall street 5. The Big Kahuna 6.  New Yorks Finest Cookies and Cream  What I thought about them: 1. Wings were SPICY! Just how I like them. They were crunchy. They could of maybe used more sauce.  2. Didn't try the wings but my friend ate them all. That's a good sign lol 3. Salad was great just DRENCHED in dressing. Ease up on the dressing!  4. Wall street pizza was delicious! Tasty. Crust was crunchy  5. Didn't try Kahuna but my friends said it was good lol 6. OMG I would eat another! The cookies and ice cream was perfect   The price for all 12 wings, 1 Chicken Caesar salad, 2 pizzas, and dessert, was $68.  I would probably return. Maybe eat less since I was STUFFED!"}
{"text":"All the food from appetizers to pizza was fresh, very good, and great service from Jeff."}
{"text":"My wife and I searched for the perfect pizza place when we moved to Az. The food, service, proximity, friendliness of staff were all superb here. We have gotten to be regulars and feel like welcome friends here. Sure there are many other pizza places but this one suits us best!"}
{"text":"Jeffrey, love your attentiveness and friendliness.. I wish there were more people like you. A+"}
{"text":"We were greeted at the door by a friendly server who gave us several seating options. We later learned her name and a little about her. Her manager was also very friendly. Our server made recommendations based on our requests. We took her advice and were pleased with our food.  We are visiting from Missouri, and leaving tomorrow, otherwise we would go back. These two ladies we met today are great ambassadors for this town; very welcoming and friendly to us out-of-towners."}
{"text":"NYPD used to be my favorite pizza in the Valley; however, based on my last couple of visits to the Chandler Blvd location it seems that the quality is not what it used to be. The dough has not tasted fresh and there is a general lack of flavor from what it used to be. I normally get the Brooklyn with pepperoni and sliced italian sausage. I don't know whether they've changed their meat vendors or cheese but it's just not as good. The pizza was also very floppy/not cooked enough. I'm not sure I will go back, at least to this location. I hope this is not indicative of what's going on at all the NYPDs in the Valley."}
{"text":"I have been a regular since 2013.  I always get the same thing with my boyfriend and the servers always accommodate our requests.  Servers are always so friendly.  I have never had a bad experience here and if there was ever a mistake made, they were so quick to fix it.  I love it here and  recommend it to everyone who asks about where to get pizza. I always get the big Kahuna with wings and it never disappoints me.  It's my favorite pizza place.    I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Love this place im from out of town so iys a place i visit ofton and love. However today was a bad experience. Just horrible service and unfriendly staff!! Need to shape up the staff!!"}
{"text":"I was recently contacted by management of NYPD Pizza and was told that they usually don't operate in such manner and did give an apology, also stated that they did not need a \"Medical Record\" to determine If a customer had experienced food poisoning/ sickness from their product. I appreciate the contact and for them reaching out to me and expressing an apology.   I will give NYPD another chance... thanks again for reaching out."}
{"text":"This is a experience that is hard to put words to. The pizza is the best I've ever had. The Zeppolis were a treat, texture and taste were perfect. Customer service was exceptional. There is this top shelf pizza and everything you have ever had is not even close."}
{"text":"We were in for bike week - saw this place next to Dirty Dog.... So glad we went in Friday night. Very cute decor. Bartender was awesome - listening to her with a couple of regulars was fantastic!!! Having been in the industry for 2o years-she is a gem! Great service with a smile.... Food was FANTASTIC!  Got the small for 2ppl and it was perfect with our zucchini.  Don't know if it was a manager or owner running the pizzas upstairs, but what a nice guy!!!   Thank for a great experience all around!"}
{"text":"To me one of the better pies in town, real east coast style, sweet sauce and good whole milk mozzarella.  Pretty consistent too, sometimes they are a little over or under cooked but they open the box for you to be sure it's good. Can't go wrong here..."}
{"text":"I love the food here!!! The garlic cheese knots are amazing I get them every time I go. The Brooklyn pizza is awesome I always order enough to have some leftovers. My girlfriend loves the pasta and the salad pizza also. Great service each time I go, I just wish I was inside their delivery area."}
{"text":"Ok I like Pizza but I don't eat it often because a whole pie in a single girl's household, well ends up being consumed for breakfast, lunch and dinner and settles onto her' azzie' in record speed. Yeah I'm no twig by far and I like food, actually I love good food. Anyway my NY friends & kids rave this is the best pizza ,so I go give it a try. Hey what can I say I ordered two different slices and ate them both! It was awesome pizza much to my surprise, since these kids eat frozen pizza, and I'm skeptical that any pizza served by the slice and individually topped can be palatable. Ok I admit I'm wrong! I'm stuck up about these things. NYPD has great pizza I can walk in order two slices however I want them, not go broke and not eat pizza for an endless number of meals and wear it my thighs and my azzie for the next month or two! I'm happy."}
{"text":"We love the pizza from here but recently every time we order pizza for delivery they forget something. I wished we could order from another location to deliver here but they refer us to this one. Hope someone from MGT read this and address the issue soon we will switch."}
{"text":"i dine in, and order out probably twice a month.  this place is amazing.  good food & service is well worth the money."}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice, all the same flat price. I usually by the lunch special of one slice, salad, and drink (with free refills) comes to just over $7 which is very reasonable for lunch in Scottsdale. People there always say hi and are friendly."}
{"text":"Our family has been here since 2009. They call us the family. They welcome us and know our names. Ryan goes and above and beyond and always has a glass of wine and knows our orders. She provides our demanding 5 year old with pizza dough and talks to our 13 year old about middle school. Those small things mean a lot and her service makes us repeat customers. The food is always fresh and if we request extra crispy pizza - they come out and verify it is to our standards. This is the place we call our neighborhood dinner place where we get fresh food and friendly service! We love this place and recommend this to anyone in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Surprise...and that's just for starters!  Met my family after work at NYPD, the food is awesome, the Bud Light is ice cold and the service was second to none!!     We had the Wall Street pizza (ask for the ingredients double chopped!) The kids had spaghetti and pizza bites, which they loved.  Also the penne ala vodka was to die for!!   Our server Bry was so friendly and accommodating,out glasses was never empty!! The manager Kendell was over the top making sure we were taken care of!  We highly recommend NYPD it's our absolute favorite place to eat!!"}
{"text":"Since I'm an ex-New Yorker, it was strange that I had not been to this pizza chain yet in my time in Arizona. Looking at the menu online, it just didn't seem like I should be spending north of $22 for a large pie with no topping. The lunch special was a better way to sample the slices and I had a couple of slices and a drink for $6.99. The slices in the case already had toppings, but if you order the special, you can get additional toppings at no charge on both slices and welcome mushrooms and peppers to the pepperoni party. The slices were good size, very foldable and it was a good lunch. The sauce might have had a touch too much garlic, but otherwise it now might be worth buying a pie, although the prices is high (should be $15 large with one topping). At this location, the staff and manager were both nice, checking on my food quality and telling me the history of NYPD. Will return."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! I come here everyday on my lunch and the servers are amazingly nice and helpful. The food is great and the environment is calm and chill.   Justin is extremely helpful and I look forward to him helping me"}
{"text":"Love this place! Vegan options that are clearly labeled and I love their garlic knots (without cheese). The staff is very friendly and the service has always been great when we go! Also, they deliver!"}
{"text":"NYPD is my favorite pizza place! The pizza is always delicious. I love the single serving option \"my za\" everybody gets what they want. Seriously love this place. Pizza, salads, garlic knots...all amazing! Online ordering is great! Great experience dining in & taking out."}
{"text":"Great salads and pizza!   We went Saturday mostly families and it was not to busy they have a good salad selection and we felt the pizza was reasonable priced.  We had never had thin crust pizza before, it was good the toppings were all at the center which I didn't like that but the crust was good."}
{"text":"Stellar experience; the whole shebang was seamless from start to finish. No issues at all with placing my order online...I stopped in the store a couple days prior to delivery, just to ensure there were no other issues, and the gals I spoke with (and I so wish I had your names!) were both personable and professional. I departed confident that all would go well...Pizzas were delivered right on time...all were as delicious as ever...Kudos to the cat who delivered them; I was in a \"legal scenario\" when he arrived, and couldn't answer his call. He waited, and all was well...Thanks to Jack for following up, and to Jaime for help above and beyond."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after a baseball tournament.  Server was great.  Good house beer.  Mozzarella was yummy!  denfinatly try the balsamic reduction with it.  pizza was delicious, especially the crust.  The biggest stand out for me was who I believe was the manager.  super nice guy.  when I accidenrky left my card in the the payment filder thing, he brought it out to us.  thank you so much :)"}
{"text":"I tried this place out as I had a coupon for a free small pizza. Was nothing special. Too doughy and I prefer crispier crust. Seem to be a lot of pizza places in the area that I will try instead."}
{"text":"Whoa, i don't know about best pizza in Valley, but pretty good.  stands for New York Pizza Department, and it's order in line, pay, find a seat and go back to the counter to pick up your order type place.  the y also had salads, and a small bar area. good price for what you get."}
{"text":"I had left a previous negative review but I got carry-out tonight.  There is no denying their pizza is excellent.  Everyone seemed so much more upbeat and friendly so I changed the negative to positive-welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Tasty pizza that has overall quality ingredients. The crust is a nice balance of thickness. The pizza itself is not greasy and I feel they put a good amount of toppings. The only reason this is a 3 is because a 4 to me is outstanding and a 5 is one of my favorites of all time. I would definitely recommend for a quality every day pizza. I also have loved the service thus far. They have always been kind and genuine."}
{"text":"$30 For a large 2 Item? I don't mind paying that for REAL Pizza..... NYPD Does not deserve to charge that much. This was my second and last visit. Under-cooked every-time.Very bland.Low quality ingredients I Appreciate that the Manager Richard tried to help/Very Nice guy.Staff was very friendly. Unfortunately I pay for the food/not the service....and the food is bland and generic. Cookie cutter pizza. Remember the plastic pizza your mom gave you to play with when you were a kid? That Pizza found its way onto the Menu at NYPD. New York would turn over in its Grave if It at here:) Sorry Guys...But The Pizza is a Joke."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding, 5 stars -we had the calzone and bbq chicken pizza. Calzone was cooked perfectly and the small was enough for the two of us. The ricotta in it was mouth watering. The reason for 4 stars is we were unimpressed with the beer selection.  It stated local beers, but only had Four Peaks IPA on draft along with coors, 805, and angry orchard.  Not exactly a local beer selection.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Update: After writing my initial review, NYPD Pizza tried a couple times to contact me and ask for a second chance. They sent a coupon to our home address and when we went in to use it, the experience was completely different. They must have been having a bad night on our first trip in because the second time we went they were awesome and the food was delicious. It does take a while for your pizza to get to you and with kids, that can be tough. However, they also offer free dough for the kids to play with while they wait and that went over big time with our boys. We will definitely return after the effort they made to ensure that a customer never goes away unhappy!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been here once and I'm sure it won't be the last time. The service was great. Our waitress was very attentive and nice. We happen to go a night where kids eat free so that was a bonus. The  Caesar salad is was good and we ordered a Hawaiian style pizza. I liked it. Not the best I've ever had but over all a good experience and we will return."}
{"text":"Love it best pizza.in town! Vegan options too!! Good beers on draft! Fresh NYC filtered water! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Well after a year or so I thought I'd give him a second chance they're just as bad as ever came in order to cold cut submarine Italian sub and a chicken parm 30 minutes later I ended up leaving with no food or money this place totally sucks"}
{"text":"Service was good, and the place is definitely plenty nice for a chain.  That said, the pizza isn't very good."}
{"text":"Great food! The wings were big, and saucy, just the way we like em! The pizza was tasty! The crust was nice and crispy. We will definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"After a day of shopping the fam was starved, we decided pizza would please us all. We ordered a large pepperoni, wings, and zucchini sticks. Everything was delish. The pizza really shined, thin crust, the foldable kind. Perfect cheese, sauce ratio. The crust was the best part! I love this pizza and can't wait til our next trip to PHX."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery last night. I ordered a medium three topping pizza and a large calzone, which was $36. Way over priced! Then I opened the pizza box, only to see that the pizza was mostly globs of over bearing cheese. All cheese and hardly any toppings is a no go in my book. I just moved back to Chandler and I will never go back to this pizza joint."}
{"text":"We had dinner here and I have to say the food was not great it was just ok. The service was OUTSTANDING!! Angelica was fantastic! She was very friendly and smiling the entire time! My son liked her so much he drew a picture for her just before we left! Even with the food just being ok we will come back! We love to see servers who enjoy what they do and support business that promote great service and positive attitudes that says a lot about the owners!! Angelica is definitely a gem!!"}
{"text":"Our first time here.  We tried the Caprese and Blanca pizzas, Spinch dip and had cheesecake and cookie and cream for dessert.  Everything was fresh, hot and flavorful. Our server, Ryan, was awesome. It was reasonably priced and everyone was friendly. Recommend highly. We'll go back."}
{"text":"Walked in got taken to a sit right away and got drinks.   Just a few moments we got our order in. Garlic knots are fantastic !  8\" BBQ chicken was on point!  And a reg sized calzone had tons of meat in it. Over all got are moneys worth! Great time!"}
{"text":"Nice clean pizzeria. Servers are friendly. Pizza is good. You get a larger portion of food for your money. Go at lunch time and spend as much as you would at any big chain fast food joint and leave fuller and with more money in your wallet."}
{"text":"Eh, not impressed. I must be honest in saying that we ordered takeout, and thus by the time we ate it, the pizza was in that lukewarm, chewy-cheese state that is not desirable from any restaurant. But aside from that, the crust seemed stale and dry and the toppings somewhat flavorless. We created our own combination, which is the same one we create at all pizza restaurants to be able to compare. It had pesto, artichoke hearts, chicken, roasted red peppers, and black olives. The ingredients did not taste very fresh and were also lacking flavor. And to be honest, the pizza was very expensive. I know that's pretty standard when you are creating your own combination, but it seems more pricey than its competitors, which I think have much better pizza."}
{"text":"Let me just say I love NYPD pizza!!! The big ziti was to die for the cheese the sauce the noodles he couldn't go wrong, my boyfriends out visiting from Florida so it was his first experience and he totally loved it also, it's almost like getting a little bit of the Big Apple in AZ! And when in doubt you can always have a personal pizza they come me to order and fresh as can be!!"}
{"text":"Try the white Pizza; you won't regret it! Never disappoints. First time at this location, since they closed the location at Priest/56th st & Ray. A little inconvenient for us since we're in ahwatukee, but that's not their fault."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this was the first time we had this issue at an NYPD Pizza.  Maybe it's just this location?  Last night my wife and I ordered in.  The usual prompt of 45 minutes until delivery was received.  That's always expected these days in a city this size.  Well the order took 1.5 hours to reach our house.  The driver said the kitchen was backed up and that he was waiting on our food to be ready.  The food was all ice cold.  It was not just made or it would have been warm....so try again.  This was very disappointing.    Update: NYPD Pizza made good by giving us a certificate to cover the cold/late food.  We went into the restaurant to eat when using this.  Service was great, fast, and professional.  Food was fresh!  We haven't tried delivery again since the incident, but seeing how they contacted us to make it right I will likely try again one day.  I've adjusted my rating to 4 stars to reflect this accordingly."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this place for a while and I have always been pleased with my food and the staff. The service is great and the managers are attentive. One of the servers thought I was come wales or England after we talked for a while. I do have an accent, but I'm from the NYC area so she was close enough! Ha. Back to the review.The pizza is always hot and fresh. I usually order for delivery and I never had any problems. They are on the expensive side, but I'm willing to pay the price because of the great service and the taste of the food. I'll always return if they keep it up!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Pizzas are absolutely amazing, as are the apps. My only negative is when you order take out. They give you two options for apps. Full or half size. When ordering the bruschetta and artichoke dip the full and half sizes are exactly the same only difference in the full size is you get more bread for dipping. So go with half sizes"}
{"text":"Loved this pizza!!!!!! Giant and tasty!  We ordered while in town visiting family. We had convinced them to try this place just off of good yelp reviews, and they proved to be accurate!"}
{"text":"Not only is the pizza and food amazing, but the service is absolutely excellent! Specifically, we walked in to pick up our pizza one night and, because we just moved into the area, we didn't have easy access to ice. So, the manager kindly  gave us a bag of ice to go! I truly believe it's the little things that really make a huge difference!"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch every now and again I always order a slice or two and a soda. I absolutely love thier specialty slices, they have the best white pizza I've had in a long time! The slices are pretty generous and one alone can fill me up and happily satisfy my pizza craving :)  The pizza dough could be a tad bit thinner crispy crust, but that's just my preference. The pizza slices are amazing. I'm glad this is a little far from where I work otherwise I'd be here all the time  I'm so happy I found this place. There are not many good food choices near my office, so NYPD is an awesome find!"}
{"text":"The food is okay.  I really like their garlic knots but that's about it.  The pizza really shouldn't be associated with anything in regards to New York.  The delicious pizza of the city of New York doesn't come to mind when trying this pizza.     I ate there today and noticed that the booths were dirty.  We sit at a booth that had food remnants on the seats.  I think the waiters could do a better job of cleaning.  If you sit at your booth long enough, then you will notice other things as well."}
{"text":"I've only visited this location once.  The food is okay but it doesn't put me in a New York State of mind.  It's tough to find a good pizza establishment.  My only complaint was that we were not properly greeted when we walked in.  The bartender only said 'hi' and walked off.  There was another employee who was apparently on her break.  She just looked at us.  So we walked out.  The employee that was sitting down, got up and walked outside to stop us from leaving.  We decided to stay and eat on the patio.  We were not impressed at all with the service.  The food was okay.  It was definitely better than other pizza chains such as Pizza Hut and Papa Johns."}
{"text":"Ryan is the BEST server EVER! Every time we come in we always request him. We have been requesting him for 3+ years! Good food, good service, and we love love love NYPD!!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place after seeing all the good reviews on yelp.....but i didn't like it all all. The slices were big and I will admit it was rather cheap but that didn't make up for the fact that it was hardly any sauce on the slices. The people that work there are nice and friendly and it is a nice place to chill but the food is blah. I ended up not even eating the second slice and tossing it. I gave this place 3 stars not for the food but because the staff is really nice."}
{"text":"Disappointing and overpriced. We got a coupon in the mail for BOGO. We used to come here all the time and haven't been in a while. This place has gone downhill and prices are too high. Save your money and go someplace else. Pizza was soggy and not cooked long enough. Plus now my stomach is terribly upset. Blah. Never again!"}
{"text":"I have? been dining here for years for special occasions. At this time I brought my family from out of town. We ordered the Da Works pizza, Upstate Style wings, Boneless chicken wings and Chicken Parmigiana. All the food was delicious and the servings are generous. The service was excellent, the two wait staff checked on us several times to refill our drinks and the food? quality.  ? The ambiance? of the restaurant feels like a pizzeria in New York. The place feels cozy and comfortable. In my opinion, the menu? price??s are about average. For less than one hundred dollars it fed five people and we had leftovers. I like this restaurant because it is nice to bring family enjoy eating ?and chatting."}
{"text":"First time here just moved from NY. The service was stupendous and the food way above any rating. I'm glad I found a local pizza spot that I can say is beyond delicious with reasonable prices. The manager Matt even came over to our table and made sure we were being treated right. They have just gained a regular customer!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a sausage pizza. It was delivered on time . However the pizza was cold and  I struggled on eat the dough even with a knife.  Very disappointed.  We order from them quite frequently"}
{"text":"We usually go for the pizza but this time I wanted to try something different. In ordered the spaghetti and meatball. It was okay the sauce was so watery that it seems like I was eating noddle soup. The meatball had no flavor what so ever. We also order the chicken wings which never disappoint. Always crispy and nice and saucy! The salads were nothing special seems like they just opened a bag of spring mix and put it in a bowl. What saved dinner was the dessert we had. It was a zeppoli sundae! Lots of cinnamon and sugar recover zeppolis topped with ice cream topped with lots of whipped cream and chocolate drizzle. Yes is it delicious"}
{"text":"Have been here several times for many years...Just never wrote a review...Had a craving for a pizza with sausage & pepperoni; and NYPD Pizza just fufilled that craving...Love the pizza, pastas, salads and even the desserts I've tried...Will be back again and again..."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times when in town. Pizza is good, staff is friendly and we haven't had to wait yet to be seated whenever we've come. Really like it!"}
{"text":"Always great service and nice staff, very attentive. Love the chicken pesto pizza and wings, very good. I've also ordered delivery as well, very quick service and always show up sooner than delivery time."}
{"text":"I have to say after 15 years of pretty good pizza I had my last experience tonight. The service is not good, the pizza is regularly wrong. In the past 4 months we have had take out several times on two occasions they held the pizza on top of the oven after we paid.  By the time we got it the pizza was not fresh. One two other occasions the pizza was made wrong and we don't order complicated pizza.  When eating there they over cooked the pizza on two occasions. The manager approached and told us they would remake another pizza which is fine other than it's another 30 minute wait. No longer worth the trouble. There are lots of options nearby."}
{"text":"Great dinning experience in every way ! Till it came time to pay ! Ever forget your wallet? I did...Ooops...5 stars to the person who trusted me on my word. The bill was settled and just for the old school value called trust This place has earned myself and all my  friends family and acquaintances business. Thank you very much. That person is a true leader on customer satisfaction. Highly recommend NYPD in Surprise to anyone."}
{"text":"2 hours for delivery on a thurs nite from 7th ave-15th ave and mcdowell...ridiculous"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner and it was delish and service was great.  Beers were cold too! Ordered honey BBQ and medium wings for an app.  Wings are very meaty, flavorful and taste fresh. Dinner was a 14\" pepperoni and sausage pizza.  Cooked perfect and hot out of the oven.  Our server was Tammy and she was great.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ordered  pizza for delivery.  They got the address  wrong but still  got the pizza here 15 minutes  early. . They help set the order up and brought all utensils.  The pizza was good . Good  lend of cheese and meat. They have a great Hawaiian  pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was better last year. Server was nice but slow and would forget to bring requested items. Knots were awesome. Cheese sticks were frozen in the middle. Good space for kids."}
{"text":"good pizza but how the hell is your air going to break in the peak of summer you guys messed up there..how the hell am I suppose to enjoy my pizza if imy sweating a lot and then the food took an hour to come out..smh"}
{"text":"Pizza was good, service was good. But... There is an odd strange odor here and the walls of the booth are filthy. Seems like this place needs a good cleaning."}
{"text":"I've lived next to this place for 4 years and I'm beating myself upside the head for not trying it sooner. Went in on a Sunday night and was seated immediately. Wait staff was very courteous and attentive. We were starving and got garlic knots and fried mozzarella for appetizers. The knots were good but the fried mozzarella was out of this world. Not your ordinary fried cheese sticks. You get slabs of fresh mozzarella coated in a delicious breadcrumb mixture then deep fried. For main course we got the Quattro Formaggi (4 cheese) pizza. Oh man it's the best I've had in quite awhile. This is my new go to pizza place!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Kendall did an amazing job and made sure we had everything we needed! Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Well I was using my Jedi mind powers when we picked this one. We walked in and low and behold Wednesday nights kids eat free. The pizza was awesome and we tried the cannoli to it was also good . Over all we were very happy we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We have enjoyed their calzones, but recently had an unpleasant experience.  We called in a to-go order, my wife arrived to pick it up.  First they charged her $20 for a $12.50 order, then had to reverse the charge and re-charge the correct amount.  Then she stood and watched as 3 employees milled around ignoring her order on the back counter when it was delivered from the kitchen.  When the one employee that was working (and on the phone) finally got around to handing her the order, the box was covered in grease, and the employee was quite put-out upon being asked for re-boxing to something suitable to be put in the car.    That's 3 strikes on one simple calzone order that we've ordered in the past at least 5 times without problems.  Management had better nip this in the bud, not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"The guy behind the counter was great! but the pizza was not.. sorry NYPD but you've got some work to do"}
{"text":"This is THE BEST pizza in all of AZ! Doesn't even matter which location! I have an Adult Autistic Son who will only eat pizza from here so I often bribe him to leave the house by saying that if he does, we will get NYPD and it works every time! I highly recommend you try this place at least once, but don't blame me if you get hooked after one time!"}
{"text":"Can I just say how amazing this pizza is. I was born and raised in NYC and this pizza truly lives up to its name. We ordered a large half white pizza and the works. I came in with my husband and twins. Johnny was so attentive and even brought over some dough to entertain our kiddos. They truly loved it. Thank you NYPD Pizza and Johnny for the great experience. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Too bad this place closed, our family had a wonderful dinner and time here on a Friday night in August. Was totally unplanned to go here, as we tried to get in to the sushi place next door and the line there was out the door. So, we wandered next door to NYPD pizza. This is my actual favorite pizza, but this was my first time at this location. The staff there was super friendly, fun, and top notch. I promised to Yelp great about them if I ever got on to write a review, and I finally did. So, even if this location is closed, the pizza is consistently amazing at every location. The absolute best if you like thin crust, large piece NY style pizza."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed! Absolutely worst fast talking management staff. We thought about going to The new Oreganos and I'm so sad we didn't. We got there and it took 3-4 minutes to be seated, it was not busy. Kendall, as the manager should really pay more attention to her staff. It was a simple order 8inch pizza and lasagna. My husband and I sat there  for 30 minutes after putting in our order. We began to look around I noticed everyone else is being served but not us. They all came in after us. We called our server over who explained it was his fault that he had too many tables and a bar to take care of and that he forgot to put in our order. He did apologize. We asked the manager to come over. She never asked us anything she was a fast talking manager who just wanted to go back to her office and hide. She kept talking over the top of me like I was a child. I'm extremely disappointed and will never be back to this location. It took 35 minutes to get a cold bowl of lasagna. It took another 15 minutes to get the pizza. We had them box it along with the cold lasagna and another lasagna the manager made and went home. What a horrible experience. Yes, the manager took care of the meal but that wasn't the experience I wanted. I wanted a good dining experience not cold food and rotten service."}
{"text":"Tasty!! That's what the family said! Will be a pizza place to visit again. Although the waitress was alittle moody, we walked out happy!! Lol my son said, \"Better than Costco\" :)"}
{"text":"Hello NYPD Pizza.  I'd like to turn myself in.  Please arrest me for attempting to warm up a so called NY style pizza from elsewhere in the fridge cause it was that baaaaad!  I heard New York's finest can offer me just a quintessential slice to expunge me of the heinous pizza crime I commited!    Yes!  Just one meatball slice was all it took!  The classic NY slice foldability was on point.  The crust had the perfect balance of chispyness (Chewy and Crispy) The cheese AKA the fats had a nice stretchyness to it.   A really good foldable meatball slice that I ordered indeed.  Since this was an already made pizza slice that just had to be reheated.  Some of my homemade meatsaball toppings were room temperatureish.  So it could've used an extra couple minutes in the oven.  I'll be back for a full size made to order pie with no lukewarm topplings.    Overall this location is a good place to watch a weekend game or why not burn off those calories afterwards and with a high intensity interval dumpster diving session at the Nordstrom Rack in the same plaza."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by NYPD for lunch. Got there around 12:30 food didn't arrive till 1:20, ten minutes before I had to go back to work. The place was not busy at all for them to take almost an hour to bring out the food. To top it all off the waiter (Keoki) forgot to add the wings I had asked for to the order. He seemed lost half the time."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of NYPD coz i think they have really good pizzas. I have a NY bias and altho there's very few places that are able to come up with a true NY style pizza, NYPD is close enough. There are four pizzas that I order at NYPD and they are: Pizza Blanca, Da Works, Joey's Favorite and Cheese. I love their Pizza Blanca which is made with Olive oil, crushed garlic, ricotta, mozzarella with your choice of spinach or Roma tomatoes. *yum* I've always liked it with spinach but I have to admit it's exceptional with the tomatoes!! Da Works is their version of supreme, and their Cheese reminds me of pizza by the slice at any pizza place in Queens but not as good as the cheese at this pizza joint my family frequents in Whitestone, NY.   Their strengths are their pizzas. AVOID the calamari, it's yuck and if you've never had calamari this should not be the place to try it... it's GROSS! Their lasagna is not half bad, and their wings are good. Overall, this is one of my go to places if I'm craving pizza or buying takeout. It's true NYPD it's your pizza I trust!"}
{"text":"Updating my review: I go on occasion for the walk-up lunch.  Their service has gone down the drain.  Can take 15-20 minutes to receive the \"express lunch.\""}
{"text":"Won't be back.  Pizza was so thin, everything fell off of it when you picked up a slice, soggy middle.  Crust on the edges was burnt. Sauce was good.  Also charge you for a take out box, over 2 bucks.  Called in for pickup, had to wait anyway, even though the place was almost empty, 3 pm. Live and learn."}
{"text":"This is a place where you go inside only if you have exhausted all other options..including going to your neighbors with a frozen pizza and a six pack of natty lite. Horrible horrible atmosphere. It was one step above a wake. Dreary. It is like a cloudy day inside with no hope of sunshine.   Which is to say, the pizza..great! the wings great! Delivery Only."}
{"text":"I had a pizza emergency and had to feed six people! Ami came to the rescue. Polite and helpful, she made the ordering process easy. Emergency solved. They even double cut the pizza for easier slice distribution."}
{"text":"I moved to the Phoenix area a month ago.  Tonight was the second night I ordered pizza and appetizers for delivery.  The first night it took an hour and fifteen minutes to receive my order.  The food was good and everyone has a bad night every once in a while.  Tonight it took an hour and forty minutes to get my order.  AND EVERYTHING WAS COLD!  My pizza looked terrible too, like it was tossed around.  Time to try some place else."}
{"text":"Great service (a waitress named Emily). We got our food pretty quick, and it was delicious, and for a very reasonable price. Warning: the size large salads are HUGE, so order a small if it's just for one person. Wings are very tasty. I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"There pizza was deliciously NYC style, yet there buffalo hot wings was so great.. Two appetizers were the garlic knot bread and spinach artichoke dip."}
{"text":"Brooklyn Family pizza was delish,  Strawberry Summer salad was awesome, and they delivered in less than 25 mins at 7:30pm on a Friday... Ahh-mazing!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, especially for lunch. They have a few options for lunch specials and they're all a good deal for the money. The wings are decent. The pizza is great. The quality of the toppings is quite a bit higher than most of the pizza places around here. The garlic knots are addicting. The only reason it doesn't get 4 stars is because the service tends to be a little slow/inattentive. Last time we were there we were pretty much the only ones in the place at around 1:30 and we waited several minutes before anyone realized we were standing there waiting to order. Prior to that, we were in for dinner and it was like pulling teeth to get refills on drinks. Overall, it's worth the trip if you can deal with sub-par service from time to time."}
{"text":"My husband and I order from here at least twice a month but felt the need to leave a review after the past two most recent deliveries. Their driver Toni is awesome!! She has brought us hot, fresh meals with all the extras we needed.  We live in a complicated complex and most food deliverers call us when they're outside,  but Toni always makes the journey up to our door! Extra points for that! She's so sweet and makes our dine at home experience better each time. Thank you, Toni!!"}
{"text":"One of the first places I have eaten since moving to AZ, pretty good.  We had a large gathering of family, and the place was fairly busy at first, but they worked with us to get everyone seated, make sure they had drink orders, then time for everyone to make up their mind.  For what I could tell, everyone enjoyed their food, especially the cheesy garlic knots...tasty... We had Da Works pizza, it was good, not the best pizza I have had, but certainly far from the worst.  Really, the only thing was it was a little light on amount of toppings, and wasnt hot, only warm,  but with that many people, I cant really complain."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good. Nothing to write home about.but the closest to home I've found here since I moved from Boston. Service is terrible and slow and in my 1 hour experience there I saw a manager for 5 minutes. May suggest another location but I haven't been to others yet."}
{"text":"One month ago, I ordered my usual, a full Sicilian veganizza with green peppers in place of the spinach.   A friend went to pick the pizza up for take-out, and when we opened the box, noticed there was no basil on the pizza.   I called the store, spoke to the manager, and he tried to offer me free chicken wings next time. I pointed out that I'd ordered their vegan option and those chicken wings wouldn't do me any good. He laughed and said he hadn't put 2 and 2 together.   He then said he'd process a partial refund of my friend's credit card. I just asked her today. It was never done. My review is being based off no follow-through on this customer service interaction. There is (almost) nothing worse than words not backed by action (lies)."}
{"text":"I have not been here since the \"fast track\" happened. I guess we should have done that--we were seated and then waited for 25 minutes for a server to come take our order--as in no drinks, no anything. After 20 minutes, I got up and asked if we misunderstood and needed to order at the counter. Another 5 minutes go by before anyone made it over to get our order. It took another 20 minutes to get food. So that sign should say, \"if you like being ignored and waiting forever for your food, opt for table service.\" We got a pizza margarita. And it was good. But I'm not going back."}
{"text":"We normally just order take out from here and it's always very good, but since it was Valentine's day we decided to eat at the restaurant as a fun treat for my son. We hadn't been since the remodel and we were very shocked at how nice the dining area looks now. We had rarely eaten at the restaurant previously because it felt too cramped, but now it's definitely a lot more open and inviting. Since it was a nice day, we sat outside which was also very nice. Our table wobbled quite a bit but our served fixed that quickly. The only negative about sitting outside was there was a man who kept comimg outside to smoke, even though it cleary says no smoking all throughout the patio. We were not affected since we were far enough away, but other tables asked to be moved inside due to his smoking. I was surprised that none of the employees said something to him. Makes me wonder if he was also an employee.   When we order take-out we normally get the Brooklyn, which is our favorite.  A 16\" is normally a good size for the three of us. This night we decided to order our own 8\" pizzas. My husband did the brooklyn, I got the chicken pesto, and my son got the cheese.  If you're hungry get a larger pizza. The singe pizzas are very small. For me, it was perfect, but my husband was still pretty hungry at the end of the night. If you have a bigger appetite I definitely reccomend ordering a larger size. Overall the flavor was very good on all three.  Drinks, I ordered their locally brewed Phoenix St. ale and it was very good! my husband had a mojito which was too sweet. We had a coupon for two free cannolis. They were less than impressive and I was very happy they were free.  Overall NYPD is one of our go to restaurants for pizza and if you stay away from the mojitos and cannolis, you will not be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Palace was empty go figure. Told me they were low on boxes that is why they could not sell one. I guess if you don't eat there you are not welcome. That is how I felt."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for their delivery times. It doesn't seem to matter what day or time it is, they always take more than an hour for delivery. I find that ridiculous given delivery times for their competitors. Ordered a pizza for the last time last Wednesday night. 75 minutes for delivery, pizza barely warm, $24 and some change for a large pepperoni, and a delivery guy who seemed insulted with his $2 tip. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Until this last Friday my NYPD Pizza experience was limited to what had been delivered to our office for sales meetings, which was good.  Having an NYPD pie fresh from the oven......heaven!!!  We ordered the house special with pepperoni, sausage and fresh basil.  The worst part was having to stop because we were full.    I only give it four stars due to OK service.   There seemed to be plenty of staff available, and yet the staff walked right past us without a word as we were waiting to be greeted and ultimately seated.   Once seated our server took good care of us!    Did  I mention that the pizza was really good?"}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza. We ordered tomato, garlic, basil and cheese. Thin New York style crust is just right. The delivery was on time. We also ordered a small Greek salad and a small artichoke dip with bread. The dip was a mistake, don't order. The bread tasted the best. The dip had a rancid taste. The salad was really good."}
{"text":"So...we will start with the great things.   A. They deliver to my hotel! B. The guy, Ryan, very friendly. And he just might be from NY. (I ordered a \"pie\" and he didn't skip a beat C. The garlic knots were good. Better than home. (LI, NY)  The so so... A. Pizza was not like home. Closer than any other I have had, but not like home. Sorry. :-( B. My order was wrong, once it got there. I got two sandwiches and no fried mozz.  C. The driver got lost on the way to my hotel.   Will I order again, sure. They deliver to my hotel :-) Is it really NY pizza...no...but probably as close as you will find on AZ."}
{"text":"Pizza is really good, best in the city probably. Usually order once a week from the Surprise location. Maybe they're getting busier or something, but last two times I ordered I was told it would be an hour to an hour fifteen. Got a phone call after an hour twenty saying it was on the way. No biggie, I don't mind waiting for quality. First time it was behind I end up with a very small pie, not even a medium as I ordered. Probably 3 inches of space in the medium box around the pie. Second time behind, size was good but I ordered the Wall Street with garlic on it. They apparently forgot to put the garlic on it or mistakenly gave me someone else's order. More likely, they just forgot. Thankfully, they did NOT forget to charge me for something I did not receive.  The quality is good and it's worth the high price, just check to make sure your order is correct and you're not being charged for something you didn't get. Also, visited the NYPD on Mill Ave in Tempe for a slice. Not a good choice for a slice, they just take a plain cheese pizza and set whatever toppings on it. When you eat it they all fall off. Order a whole pie instead."}
{"text":"Good pizza and they delivered to our room at the hotel close by. Wings pretty tasty too. Food was above average but not worth the $35 for 6 wings and a large pizza."}
{"text":"Not sure what is happening, but two visits and two messed up orders.  Both times it took them more than an hour and half to prepare our pizza.  The first time they apologized for the \"slow service\" and the fessed up that they lost our order.  Six weeks latter - they DID EXACTLY THE SAME THING AGAIN. Not only did they lose our order, but then when we got home they gave us the wrong salad order.  Their pizza is not good enough to justify this type of wait.  We will look for another pizza place that manages their orders better."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to the 7th. Ave & McDowell location.  Overall, I have enjoyed each visit and the food has been good.  My wife enjoyed her calzone and would order again.  The waitstaff was friendly and helpful.  I don't have anything negative to say about NYPD Pizza, but I'm just not sure it's up to the standard set by other downtown pizza restaurants."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my aunt on friday and the food was delicious like always! We ordered zucchini to start off then we both ordered the lunch special with a salad and piece of pizza, which both were super yummie! Also, this location has Mountain Dew which I was super excited about! I definitely will be back, I love NYPD pizza!"}
{"text":"Love this kind of pizza with the thin, flexible, chewy crust.  We are visiting Scottsdale for a Giants game and wanted a pizza delivered to our rental house after sitting and baking under the hot sun at a winning game (yay). This was very good - ordered three 18\" for 8 adults and 4 young kids.  ALL was eaten - no leftovers. The toppings are not heavy and generous but good. I would choose this pizza parlor again if I were a local but I'd order more!  Delicious."}
{"text":"I went here recently with my family.  I need to eat gluten free and NYPD has a poor gluten free menu.  They have 1 salad on the GF menu and it is basically a salad on top of a gluten free crust.  I ordered it and it came with a regular crust.  Luckily I noticed and sent it back.  Because of this, it took over 30 minutes to get my meal.  The food was okay.  I would like NYPD to include their other salads on the GF menu.  If there is an item on the salad that has gluten - just note to remove that item.  There is a reason why I am not ordering GF pizza because most of them do not taste good.  This one included.  Putting a salad on top of a crappy crust does not make it better.  We had a groupon for NYPD, which can only be used for dine in and only $20 at a time - not much of a coupon.  I won't be buying one again."}
{"text":"Have ate there quite a few times love the Greek salad and always get the works pizza!! Never have been disappointed and my husband likes it too"}
{"text":"Great food! Customer service is awesome! We were there when it was 112* out and our car broke down. The let us in and have us free drinks!  NYPD= great"}
{"text":"The best gluten free, Vegan cheese pizza i have ever had. Great work NYPD pizza, i will return 100%."}
{"text":"Chandler location : Danielle was our waitress tonight and she was literally the best waitress ever! Thank You, Danielle. I will be sure to come back. Food was amazing . Atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"This place isn't fancy and you shouldn't expect it to be. But it is good. And the staff is nice. My girlfriend and I continue to return for lunch or dinner. We always get a half order of garlic knots, split a salad, and then some pizza and wings. It's a place that I can go and catch up with my friend and have a good meal without breaking the bank. I'll be back!  Oh and the seasonal pear salad knocked my socks off!"}
{"text":"First visit, I need pasta, sausage, peppers and garlic toast on a Friday night. Done deal..."}
{"text":"They reopened and loved the new look! Every employee that walked by us were extremely friendly. Hands down the best customer service experience I've had in a long time. Waitress was awesome and we got an appetizer on the house. Our pizza was so delicious and fresh. The price was also great!"}
{"text":"Ahh the joys of living in Phoenix.  The cheery voice taking my order let me know about the 1-1:15 hour delivery wait.  I just had to try something different than Dominos.  Guess what?  Dominos is actually better and $10 less than my overpriced $32 pizza/meatball sandwich meal.  This has solidified my opinion that the best pizza in Phoenix is still Spinatos.    The NYPD meatballs had a taste that could not be recognized; if these are meatballs, then they should be renamed spicy bready dough balls.  The pizza was a little warm when I got it and certainly not thin crust.  So many pizza places lie about \"thin crust\" that the next time I'm going to ask how thin?  The cheesecake was actually the best part of it; next time, skip the pizza and just order dessert for lunch!"}
{"text":"Not much has changed over the years in the Scottsdale PV or Northern Phoenix area Pizza wise, and this NYPD pizza franchise lives up to the mediocre in Phoenix. One of the tests I use to figuring out if a place has decent pizza is how it tastes the next day in the fridge. The nearly flavorless crust, the sliced meatballs that are essentially gray slices of mostly bread and sparse toppings make it unappealing, but then I guess it serves me right to eat leftovers :)   There's really two things though, that really irked me enough to make me post.  How do I get to $45 including tip for a large pizza with sliced meatballs and six meatballs that were at best medium sized and disappointing. The final item that takes the cake are no Coca Cola products. There's nothing better than a great pizza slice and a coke or diet.  At this NYPD it's no Coke Pepsi!   What I would recommend to the owners is check out the NYPD pizzas in more competitive markets like Orlando where restaurants have to be good, and are just consistently better. Tasty pizzas, salads and Coke products made my visit to an NYPD on I Drive really great.   Cmon North Phoenix, please give us some decent pizza!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in the valley. I'm from jersey so I'm real picky...no I'm a snob when it comes to pizza. I love this pizza and if you have tried their zepollis yet...order them with all 3 dipping sauces!"}
{"text":"Great service and personal pizzas. Bbq wings were good and crispy  great beer selection for only having 6 taps. Beers were $3.50 on Sunday's for a pint of craft beer"}
{"text":"I work right around the corner from this pizza joint. So we go there at least once a week. I am definately a pizza connoisseur so I will give this place ashout out!!! WOOT WOOT. The staff is always really friendly and they decor is also kinda clever, They also have a rooftop patio you can eat on that is cool if the weather permits.  A fun fact, all the water used to make there dough comes from New York. I would call that going the extra mile for authenticity.  I wouldn't go there if your party is larger then 5 or 6 as the place isn't that big.   try it for lunch sometime, you wont be disappointed, and if you are I didn't recommend anything"}
{"text":"The pizza was good. Fresh mozzarella.  The fried zucchini was overdone and very thin. And the garlic cheese knots were not garlicky.  If you order ranch, it doesn't have a lot of seasoning.  If you go just stick with pizza"}
{"text":"Pizza is prertty darn good. I forget what it was called on the menu, but basically it was canadian bacon n pineapple. Crust was just right. We also had the ceasar salad. This is the reason why it didnt get 5 stars. Lettuce seem a little wilted. Service was excellent. Because they make the pizza fresh, it does take a while, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I like to come to this NYPD for some lunch. My thing to get is a slice of Wallstreet and a small Greek salad. It's like $6 and change for the combo. I recommend dipping your crust in the Greek dressing. Probably better for you than ranch. Oh but if they don't have any Wallstreet prepared, don't make the mistake of ordering it anyways. What they do is grab a slice of pepperoni and then stick all the missing toppings on that thing. I think this is a typical thing to do, but there are so many meats on a Wallstreet that it doesn't end up tasting right since the toppings aren't baked in the right way."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I have tried another local place for pizza, but we figured that we would try another place for comparison.  We were both very impressed!  You really can't judge the inside by the outside.  If you merely drive by and look, then you are expecting a typical fluorescent lite, fast food pizza place, and nothing more.  However, we walked in with the hostess opening the door for us.  We had called ahead to place an order for pick-up.  The inside was very nice, a very dark wood stained, pizza parlor decor.  The staff were on point with customer service, and the Manager seemed very on point with keeping things in order.  The pizza and antipasto salad were amazingly great!  I would say, that if you have never tried this location, then  you need to stop in and eat!"}
{"text":"was here on national pizza day 2018, sat at bar with coupon.  Took 10 minutes for a wait person to show up.  ordered pizza, halfway through eating, was asked if I would like some bread with, I say sure.  bill comes after finished, coupon was not fully honored, I was charged $3 for bread \"knots\"..  nothing was said about charge when bread was offered.  manager called me a day later, was sorry about misunderstanding, would send me coupon in mail.  2 weeks later-nothing.  plenty of pizza places in my hood, this one will not get my business, and I suggest readers of this comment also avoid."}
{"text":"Customer Service is back!  Hey Nikki, Matt Scottsdale Pima ought to be a manager .  I had a problem a few weeks back, and returned last night.  Matt, unsolicited came to our table, introduced himself as assistant manager, I introduced myself, he recognized my name, pulled up a chair, and wanted to know the details of my prior problem.  He was terrific.  Now if only my other local hangout, Macaroni Grill Desert Ridge to which we shall not return, was as professional."}
{"text":"This was my favorite for 2 years. If you have it delivered make sure to order extra crispy. It's a toss up between NYPD and Rays."}
{"text":"This pizza has to be one of the best in the valley. I ordered a 5 topping 18\" for about $25, well worth it. My brother just had his wisdom teeth pulled two days ago and has been eating oatmeal and pudding for these past two days. I holla lets do some NYPD for lunch! my brother jumps up with this smile on his face, so we head out. Fresh ingredients, good service, well worth it."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot for the M-F crowd.  The parking sucks (due to it being near paradise bakery).   They have a quick grab and go menu/walk thru with lunch specials. I got a slice and a salad, my husband got 2 slices. We paid, easily found seating and our food arrived really fast. My side salad (greek) was huge and yummy and my pizza was good. My husbands pizza was also delicious (according to him)   If you want a place you don't have to wait at, fight for seating and get great lunch specials....come here :)"}
{"text":"I can't speak to 98% of the other pizza joints in town, but I can say that I eat here every time I travel to Scottsdale.  I was born and raised on the east coast and now live in Minnesota.  My wife, who was born and raised in Minnesota, agrees that the best pizza comes from the Mid-Atlantic area of the country (and we've traveled to 47 states).  All of this being said, NYPD Pizza is the real deal - it lives up to expectations for east coast or \"NY\" pizza.  We'll continue to visit every time we're out here."}
{"text":"As a NY'er...I can tell you this pizza isn't THAT good...and it's inconsistent. I like Ray's far better."}
{"text":"Our server was nice, we asked what the most popular pizza was, and ordered it (da works) we asked for no bell pepper and add garlic instead, we also asked for it to be well done. We were impressed that the food runner came out with the pizza to make sure it was over done enough. He went back and cut it, and when he brought it out there were bell peppers, and no garlic. If it were extremely busy, I would have understood, be we went in at 8:30, and the place closes at 9:00, and we were the very last pizza to be made for the day. When we had it boxed up, our server asked us if we liked it, I said, it was good, although they put bell pepper on it, and I don't like bell pepper. She asked if I was allergic to them, and I said no, she said that was a good thing. I think it had to be the kitchen's fault,  because our server confirmed our pizza order with us. This was our first time at NYPD Pizza, and I think it will be our last."}
{"text":"Best pizza place in Scottsdale! We love going there and as well order take out anytime we feel like pizza."}
{"text":"We just got this...the zucchini cakes are hands down the best I ever had! Pizza...delicious! And the upstate sauce wings were great!"}
{"text":"Pretty bad pizza. Under cooked dough covered in cheep cheese. Their crust is crap. I wish I would gone somewhere else for lunch for $30 I'm sure I could have found a better meal."}
{"text":"So my company catered in NYPD today. They delivered pizzas, wings and salad.   The wings were good. Still hot, good amount of sauce and crispy skin. The pizza was good but had too much grease. They are large slices so the grease just pools up, making it unappetizing. Overall, the flavor was very good, with just the right seasonings, tasty sauce (could've used a bit more sauce tho) and good cheese. Again, very greasy tho. I'll try it again and see if ordering directly works out better."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for the first time here for delivery.  Got a Margherita.  It was ok.  A little too much crust with not a lot of flavor.  When delivered it was not hot so must have been sitting for awhile...."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and calzone.  Always great service from friendly staff.  Children welcome.  Try the garlic knots!"}
{"text":"Our waitress Tinill was AWESOME!!! It was our first time at NYPD and we enjoyed our service, our waitress, and last but never least the food!!! Definitely going back...."}
{"text":"A very nice pizza.  I haven't made up my mind which is more authentic, NYPD or Ray's.  Both, have the thin NY style crust, but NYPD makes me feel like I'm waiting for an E train to Queens; whereas Ray's feels more upper east side-ish."}
{"text":"I want to love this place. The food is good but service is extremely slow. Painfully slow, most especially given their high prices. Granted, I've never eaten in the restaurant, as we always do delivery but I'm sorry, two hours for delivery is crazy. Either don't offer delivery or stick to your time comittments. I can understand the occasional delay but this place is consistently behind. Will be passing this place up in the future."}
{"text":"Being from the East coast and just recently coming back after a NY visit, I was craving some good Brooklyn pizzeria type/style pizza and a friend recommended I check this place out.  2 stars because I got good customer service and it was something other than typical chain pizza but it just didn't cut it.  I got 3 slices, each were huge like NY style:  Buffalo chicken, BBQ chicken, and cheese.  Cheese:  Worst one, literally tasted like a reheated Ellios frozen pizza.  Would not get again BBQ chicken: Not bad, flavor was there and the crust was soft and chewy but again lacked that crispy pizzeria feel. Buffalo chicken:  Best out of the three, had a good kick that wasn't too strong with celery pieces, and again the soft flowery crust.  Overall:  If you're craving a different style of pizza than pizza hut/dominos this will do the trick, however, in terms of taste and NY feel-wise, it doesn't cut it honestly."}
{"text":"I hate this danged pizza it's down right addictive,  I am thinking about that stretchy cheese right! This was our third time here. The first time my daughter and I met for lunch, service was slowwwwwww.but the pizza was good tasted like more!  The second trip, we got take out, didn't take too long, I talked to a man who was waiting and trying to see a game while waiting. The pizza was good, so two days later we were inside in the round booth with my grandson who was hiding under the table. Had wings and pizza, both were good.  There will be a next time!"}
{"text":"Great little pizza place! We went there on a whim one Friday night and were very pleasantly surprised.  Great ambiance and superb service! The pizza was pretty good as well but they accidentally brought out the wrong pizza.  They were very apologetic and even gave us the pizza for free! As well as a free dessert! Our server was beyond pleasant even before this happened.  Also, the beer that they make, an amber, was actually very good, I recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"I loved our server.  He had no idea what he was talking about when it came to beer/wine, but he was extremely friendly, paid us plenty of attention (but not too much), made us feel welcomed, and made our experience here wonderful.  The pizza?  PHENOMENAL.  We got the Pizza Blanca and Vinny's Choice, both were cooked to perfection with a good balance of spices. The toppings were fresh and flavorful, and this home-cooked meal --while more expensive than regular chain-store pizza-- more than lives up to its price with its outstanding flavor.  Also, for the beer drinkers, the selection is limited, but their happy hour deals are exceptional.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Like the one in Avondale and Scottsdale, the pizza is excellent.  However, our server took a long time to take our order.  My friend who was 25 minutes late in meeting me, needed to use the restroom, but we waited a while so we could put in our order.  Additionally, the server was aloof & unfriendly barely smiling.  Overall, because of the bad service, it was not a good dining experience."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza places in the west valley.  Been here a couple of times getting 2 slices.  I enjoy the NY decor here as well.  Went here last year for Christmas.  Tonight I'm trying the location in downtown phoenix on McDowell.  Waiting for my friend who is running late."}
{"text":"I had a date in January here with Jen.  We got the meat pizza, which was great.  I thought our date was pretty good, but wasn't quite up to the hype of our texting and online chatting.  She was very talkative and definitely an adventurous extrovert.  She lived in New York (Appropriate NYPD PIzza topic) for a few years to be close to theater, but moved back to Arizona because of lack of money.  It was another unsuccessful first date, not leading to a second date.  Overall, I recommend the pizza and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Happy to say things got Resolved I hope to go back soon since things have been Resolved and have not gone yet I will give 3  until my return  (but to be honest b4 the incident) it was 5  I hope it is when I return"}
{"text":"After my previous review i was reached out to by the manager of this location who apologized and gave me a gift certificate to come back and have a better experience. Now i am very impressed. Not just with the way that they handled everything but how much they care about their customers. They make sure every issue big or small is resolved and strive for excellence. Good job goodyear NYPD!!! I am a regular customer and i love the food but theyve exceed my expectations this time"}
{"text":"pasta sauce is a little spicy which I love, great meatballs and calzones and the pizza of course is great!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  It's very... comfortable... It was warm from the cold outside. (I'm a native!!! I can't take 65 degrees!)  And smells AMAZING.  Their pizza smells so good, it's ridiculous.  Walk in... they do have a bar... complete with barstools, neon signs, \"tacky\" (but I like them) posters from movies...  We sat in the group section.  I was coming in expecting to have their cookie with ice cream to celebrate my birthday and leave.  We ended up having the Soho Salad Pizza, Fried Calamari, and then their Cookie.  I've had their pizzas in the past (pre-Yelp) and I really liked them.  You know... their Soho Salad Pizza was GREAT.  Four stars.  Completely makes you feel that you are not eating something high in calories AT ALL.  Very tasty and we would definitely order it again.  I was telling my partner that it was reminiscent of CPK's salads.  Almonds, feta cheese... and of course the awesome dressing that wasn't too heavy.  Calamari... I was ok with it.  Three stars for me.  While I agree that I've had better, I didn't think it was terrible, but at the same time, it could have been crispier and with more seasoning.  It was fairly bland.  I think the sauces that went with it made it.  And of course, the cookie.  Halfway cooked... just the way I liked it with two huge scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. :)   5 stars. :)  Gooey... warm... soppy... perfect. :)  And it's not too big. Sharing between two people isn't uncomfortable for the belly... even after having the Soho Salad Pizza and the Fried Calamari.  We'll be back.  I want to have their pizza again. :)"}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and every year when I come in to chandler to visit, I always have to come here for dinner. I love this restaurant. Their pizza is awesome and their service is great. This is a well managed, clean restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't eat pizza. No really, I don't. Not normally. But every once in awhile, even the most discriminating tongue gets a hankering for a good pizza. That is NYPD. If I am going to get a pizza at home, it's the only option I would ever consider. So fresh. The best ingredients. Not heavy. A perfect balance between sauce and toppings. The crust is amazingly light, fresh, delicious. It's simply the true taste of what pizza should be. Highly recommended. #perfection"}
{"text":"I had to pick up my car after it had some minor cosmetic surgery at Scott's Coach Works and decided to stay in the area for awhile. After browsing around Last Chance awhile I decided to grab some lunch before heading home.   Although their premade pizza's looked pretty good, I decided on the lunch size Louie Prima calzone. The wait would be about 20 minutes, so I went next door to Fry's for some quick grocery shopping.   I picked up my lunch and it just about killed me to smell it but not inhale it on the way home. As I finally sat down to eat it I was like a kid at Christmas! Every time I tore into the perfectly browned crust I found another treasure. Sliced tomatos, gobs of spinich and a load of my absolute favorite-ricotta cheese all mixed up with a fair share of mozzarella too! And of course the marinara sauce for dipping.  It was pretty messy to eat, but anything I eat usually ends up being messy and in my book: messy=good. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I really like their pizza. It truly reminds me of being in New York. I got my free birthday pizza to go. Usually I order in and we get more stuff but was too busy to sit and enjoy. I ate some whole hot for dinner w d the remaining for breakfast. Love cold pizza especially good cold pizza.  I am glad nypd is so close."}
{"text":"I finally came back because I was in the area and starving.   I ended up having to wait a good 45 minutes for my gluten free pizza. They did end up comp'ing me the meal because of that. The pizza was pretty good but hard to really enjoy after the wait.   The manager was super nice and came over to apologize, he even had us do a taste test for a new version gf crust (the older/current was better).  I may indeed end up going back 1 day.."}
{"text":"We have come to this location several times over the years and little by little the quality and taste has gone downhill. This most recent experience is likely our last.   We had take out of a Mott's Street Meat Lover and a Joey's Favorite. Mott Street is a pepperoni, sausage and meatball pizza. It was pretty good but the crust was just too darn doughy. I was born in NY and I know NY pizza. It's not this doughy. Joey's Favorite is a veggie pizza. The crust was actually soggy from all the veggies. It's been this way a few times, but this particular time was the worst. It rendered the pizza inedible and as I totally love veggie pizza, it was disappointing enough to force my hand with writing this review.   NYPD pizza is kind of pricey for pizza, especially when it's subpar pizza. It's been nice to have them close by but it's just not worth it anymore to suffer through less than delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Went to NYPD with some co-workers, and being from the east coast was interested in how good this place would be. Although I can not speak about the Pizza I can speak about the Calzones. By far some of the best I have ever had. These things are packed with quality ingredients and flavor. I also had an order of garlic knots which were equally as tasty. I liked NYPD Pizza so much I had it again as takeout at a later date. Overall a great place at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Family went in for Calamari and Pizza. Calamari was really small - like left over or end of supply. Cheese Pie was great but the attitude of the Waiter wasn't really. We mentioned the small pieces and he agreed and said \"yeah they are small pieces here\" And then he mentioned - Yeah but there gone!  And he was right and so are we."}
{"text":"Food is delicious as always and delivered in 30mins. Wow that was fast, website quoted 60mins. Very satisfied. Drivers are always very friendly. Thanks DJ. Ticket number 150 place on 1/15/2018."}
{"text":"I live in California and I was in Arizona for a wedding. The next day after the wedding, the bride and groom's family had a BBQ. I'm vegetarian so I wasn't able to really eat anything they had cooked and I was starving. I was in the mood for pizza that day but I normally go to the same pizza place since I am really picky with my pizza flavor and texture. Well, first of all, thank you NYPD for being vegetarian friendly and having healthier options. Second of all, the pizza was really good and had great flavor. I would definitely drive out to Arizona for some NYPD pizza. Well, I mean, If i drive out towards the area, I will stop. Last but not least, our waiter was really really nice. He conversated with us and made sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"Being from queens New York and I say with absolute confidence this tastes just like the pizzeria pizza from NYC, best pizza in arizona hands down!"}
{"text":"I am a pizza nut! That is to say I love all pizza. I grew up in a pizza restaurant. Worked at one all through high school. I have known and been able to love pizza all over this country.  When I received my pizza from NYPD pizza in chandler AZ I was not disappointed not one iota. I ordered the Mott Street Lover. I added pineapple. The meat is really what makes this pie! I have to say that the meatballs are what really did it for me. So much so that today I am sitting in the restaurant getting ready to order the meatball sandwich. The sausage is the traditional link sliced and I have a feeling that when they put the sausage on the pie that it is only partially cooked and let it finish in the oven because I can taste the fat that is rendered from the meat. Their choice in cheese is magnificent it has a moist, almost creamy texture. I did not get a chance to eat in the store as I sit here today I am waited on hand and foot. Joe is very attentive. They have a traditional Italian appeal. I am sitting at the bar which has 12 beers on tap.  One of the best pizzas I have ever had. And I travel quite a bit! Did not expect this caliber of pie in Chandler Arizona! This is a must do whenever you are in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Da Works crust was doughy and loads of bell pepper and onions were raw. Very little sauce or cheese. About 4 pepperoni and 4 bites of sausage on the whole 14\" pizza! I'm surprised at the good reviews. That was why we chose you for delivery to our hotel, while visiting here. Our delivery girl was pleasant and well compensated, but she should have brought us condiments, instead of us having to go down to her car to get them. I won't be saving this place on Yelp."}
{"text":"I was very dissappointed with my pizza. I ordered extra thin and it was very thick crust. The pizza had way to much garlic, and I love garlic. The bottom of the crust was charred and tasted like ash. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"NYPD responded to my less than positive review on yelp promptly. I thought that it was cool and showed that they really care about their customers.  As requested in their response, I emailed them my contact info so they could find out more about my experience. Never heard back from them. I guess it's just a gimmick to make people reading yelp think they care. Instead of impressing me, that gimmick has dropped my review to a 1 star. You've officially lost our business. Grimaldi's it shall be.  After the last post I received a call from their office. She was genuine, pleasant and thanked me for the review. They took the time to shop the restaurant after my review. They learned that some items were being prepared improperly and that my order was placed incorrectly.  They're sending us gift certificates to try them again. Because she seemed sincere, we will try them again."}
{"text":"Food and service are great.  Wide variety of pizza, salads, and pasta.  My favorite pizza is Fran's Favorite.  The wings are great too.  I also recommend the Greek salad.  It's a little on the pricey side, a few drinks and a  pizza  will run you about $40 for two.  But I do love the great food, ambiance and friendly service."}
{"text":"Place is always dead. Pizza is Ehh. Try BARROS. And take your no gun policy back to NYC"}
{"text":"NYPD makes a decent pie and is a perfect place to go for a quick lunch.  A colleague and I came here last week and had a nice time,  Cheese slices are $2.25 and Sausage and Pepperoni (photos) were $2.90.  So $5.57 for a quick lunch seems very good to me.  Don't get me wrong, this is not gourmet pizza or a wood fired pie by any stretch, but it was good, fast and cheap.  Fired Pies over on Ray couldn't fit our time window, but NYPD did the trick."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service. Walked up to order one of the combo lunch options. No wait to find a table. Food was brought put hot and in a few minutes. Woulf go back. There were two tvs near the front foor showing different sports games. Cute NYC subway theme. Place was clean."}
{"text":"Great service, I ordered the wrong pizza and the changes it out. (Caught it just in time) had one if the local beers and it was great."}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix during spring break, and I looked at Yelp reviews and menus to find a place to make all of the members of my family of 4 happy. We arrived at NYPD Pizza around 7:30 and were promptly seated.  The place was about half full.  Natalie greeted us and provided excellent service throughout the night.   My wife ordered a glass of wine and had a beer. We ordered a small Harvest salad to share--we received the large--and three of us ended up sharing.  It was awesome!   My daughter ordered the spaghetti with garlic knots.  She loved it, and the portion size was generous.  My son had the traditional wings, and they were good too!   My wife and I shared the 14\" Wall Street and it was delicious.  We ate all but one piece.    If you are looking for a reasonably priced pizza joint with a large variety and good service, NYPD pizza should fit the bill.  And again, Natalie was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food & great service! The crust of the pizza was light & crispy, the salads were fresh and delicious. We will visit every time we come to Tempe."}
{"text":"NYPD Pizza is my favorite pizza place in Scottsdale.  There are options for all types of diets including vegan and vegetarian."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chandler pizza I've had yet! Everything was delicious from the Cheesy Garlic Knots to the New York style pizza to the cheesecake. Had a few snags with the order (computer issue not the staff) but Danielle made sure to make everything a great experience! Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Coming from the Bay Area, I thought everything at NYPD is cheap and a great deal, but more importantly, it was tasty. For three people, we ordered 6 cheesy garlic knots, 6 boneless Hell's Kitchen wings, a half size of the spinach artichoke dip, a large spinach salad, and a small BBQ chicken pizza. The same meal back home would've cost at least 50% more, and that's a conservative guess. We arrived at lunchtime on Saturday and the restaurant was pretty empty. There's a construction project going on in the parking lot so it wasn't super clear to an out-of-towner like me that it was even open, but I was still surprised it wasn't more crowded. Our server, Justin, was polite and attentive, without being overbearing. Props to him!   The only thing that I found not quite up to par was the garlic knots. I did enjoy them because chewy carbs + cheese is my favorite food combination, but I didn't really taste any garlic. The spinach artichoke dip was pretty mild, and the bread (I think it was pizza dough?) that came with it was delicious. They weren't skimpy on the salad toppings as it was absolutely loaded! I didn't have any of the wings, but my husband seemed pleased. By the time the pizza arrived, I had more or less filled up on the appetizers, but I had a couple of slices and was also pleased. It was nice and cheesy with a well-seasoned crust, although I feel like it could've had more of the toppings.   NYPD is an absolute gem and I will definitely come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I went to dinner here last night. The customer service is fantastic! They had a Facebook promotion about a week ago offering a free 10\" cheese pizza with a coupon, but apparently there was some sort of issue and they stopped honoring the coupon midway through the promotion. I commented to management about that, and instead of simply giving me a 10\" cheese pizza, they gave me a $50 dining certificate! So, I tried all sorts of things on the menu I normally wouldn't have tried.  Mott St Meat Pizza This was DELICIOUS! I can't wait to order it again!  Mozzarella Sticks I wasn't blown away by these and thought the menu price was too high for the quality and quantity.  Garlic Cheese Knots This was by far the best part of the meal. I got it with Alfredo sauce. Next time I think I might just have a meal of these.   Meatball Hero This was so-so. The meatballs were yummy and there was tons of cheese, but the sauce was very sweet and I don't think the bun was toasted because it was soggy.  The chips they came with tasted like they came out of a bag. Homemade chips would have been a nice touch.   Cannolis These were good, but very small for the price.   Cheesecake This was delicious and the portion size was nice.  Overall, I'd say that if you order what they're known for (pizza and garlic cheese knots) you'll be blown away!"}
{"text":"So excited that an NYPD Pizza opened in my neighborhood!  We stopped in with a friend last week and had a great experience - friendly server, nice atmosphere and delicious pizza!  I tried the Big Kahuna and loved it!  The personal pizza was the perfect size for me, but the guys in the group ordered the small since they were hungrier than I was.  Love that they have cider on tap too - bonus!"}
{"text":"I run by for a slice here about once a week but I need to stop that. I just do not think it should take more than 5 minutes and it usually takes closer to 10! (Even when they are not busy.) I am never disappointed when I stay and get a table but sometimes I don't have time for that."}
{"text":"Ordered large all veggie pizza (as a vegetarian I know it can be difficult to make a crispy) waitress specifically told us to make order it \"extra crispy\" so we did.. Out comes a very light pizza... Skeptical, three friends and I all took a bite to confirm our pizza was very much so undercooked. When we were unable to get our servers attention, another server noticed we weren't eating, she got a manager who we hoped could resolve the situation. She asked 3 times if we wanted our same pizza put back into the oven (makes NO sense) then offered to remake our pizza, (though we just mentioned that we already waited once before and weren't able to stay to wait again). The manager did not seem like she was interested or concerned that after a pizza place that had been open for \"21 years\" just served a pizza that was not done. It's unfortunate, but pizza is pizza. This just was not good."}
{"text":"This place is seat yourself, so when we came in Monday around lunch time, we sat down immediately. We came in with the intent to use a BOGO coupon for large pizzas, and there were no issues using it. First off, this pizza is so delicious, and secondly, it is MASSIVE. For two people, two large pizzas were more than enough. We brought home a pizza and a half. I would definitely return here again. The atmosphere is very nice too! Feels more high end than the rest of the places on Mill!"}
{"text":"NYPD pizza was always my all time favorite pizza since it first started. I order their food for about a few years now and I can say that their pizzas especially are one of the best in the country in my opinion. That's just how good their food is too me. Prices are a little high but that doesn't stop me from ordering there weekly. You guys should really try their options they provide. You will not regret it, I guarantee you."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I have eaten here once weekly (at least) for over a year: it's a gem!  The food is great, the prices are reasonable, and ambiance is pleasant.  I tend to order the cheese garlic knots as an appetizer for the table, two slices (either Big Kahuna or Da Works), a caesar salad, and a Mango tea. Berry good.  The service here isn't consistent, but it's not poor enough to override the strengths of the establishment. Pros vs cons . . . pros win!"}
{"text":"Decent pizza but a bit overpriced.  I thought it  was better under the original owners.  There are a lot of different pizza places to choose from in Scottsdale and I'm not sure this place separates itself above the others to warrant more than 3 stars.   Worth a try but don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Great Pizza! Rocio was our server and she did an excellent job explaining the menu and offering samples of the NYPD Uptown Amber Ale. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Sicilian pizza here is amazing, as is the Alfredo sauce. Food and service are both great. Ordered pizza and cheesy bread for pick up, and everything was ready when I got there, no extra wait. Will definitely be back to try some of the other items on the menu :)"}
{"text":"When it comes to pizza....I am a snob. After tasting the food of the gods direct from NY, I have yet to find a suitable facsimile in other parts of the country. I will say that NYPD comes pretty dang close. Even some of my friends from the east coast can attest that it is \"pretty close to NY pie\". I am partial to eating pizza like a fat kid so when I get a slice of sicilian in front of me you would think that the zombie apocalypse was right around the corner.  The prices are fair for what you get and I highly recommend eating carbs with your carbs and order yourself the cheese covered garlic knots. If anything, you will be vampire proof for at least 24 hours. Some locations have a great Happy Hour and an acceptable set up for alcohol. Go, eat, love, regret and do it all over again.  Boo to the yah."}
{"text":"We are from LA and were driving in from a long day of rock climbing and thought it would be easy to get a pizza fairly late in Phoenix since it's such a big city. Turns out, not so much on a Monday night. Almost every place near our hotel was either closed all day on Mondays or closed at 9 or earlier. We called two that were open and they had only weird options... deep dish, no chicken or meatballs, etc. One even said they have sausage but it comes in a single sheet on the pizza. WTF does that even mean? So finally in desperation we called NYPD, even though they were closing in 6 minutes. They saved the day! Said they could take the order and just knock if the door was locked. Meatballs? Of course. Chicken? Would you like grilled or crispy? And they even had garlic knots that were to die for. The guy who helped us (I think he was the manager on duty) was super awesome, gave us info about the area, etc. And the food was great! This will for sure be our regular pizza place when we go through Phoenix from now on... even if others are open. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I eat a lotta pie from all over the place and today I found another great place. The pie here is wonderful! Soft chewy crust gooey cheese. I ordered takeout large pie xtra cheese mushrooms and sausage. It was pure perfection. When I arrived I was treated with plenty of hellos and smiles. They have a fridge that shows their salads and cheesecake and yup I was sold up. I'll be dinning here again soon for sure."}
{"text":"Came here on a groupon, food was good at the time, and service was mediocre. Server was polite but had to ask for plates/ napkins , refills, and the dressing we ordered with our wings. We were nearly done with the wings by time I got the dressing. If I would've waited for the dressing the wings would've been ice cold. Unfortunately after eating here my family and I became very sick and have been for several days. And this was the only place we all ate at in common.  Will probably never return here to this location and throw away the other $20 groupon voucher."}
{"text":"This place is excellent, both in food and service.   My wife and I have eaten in the restaurant and had food delivered many times. And in those (literally) dozens of times, we have had a single issue which was rectified IMMEDIATELY.  And it was as simple as we got the wrong pizza delivered. And they sent the correct one right away, Stellar customer service.  Now, between delivery and dining in, I do recommend dining in. Not because the delivery is any less stellar, but because the atmosphere of this restaurant is so inviting and friendly you shouldn't miss it. Even when they are super busy, they are attentive, polite, and efficient. The serving staff is always ready with a suggestion if you get stuck on deciding what to order, and they are accommodating with special requests (my wife is pregnant and puts the oddest stuff together on a pizza sometimes, and they pull it together flawlessly). The managers are present and engaged with their clientele without being obtrusive.   Now for the food. Excellent. I have had pizza, pasta, salad, sandwiches, appetizers,  and desserts here and have never been disappointed with anything. The care and pride they take in the kitchen is evident in everything I have had. Prices are reasonable as well. All in all, this is probably our favorite place to eat locally."}
{"text":"went there for lunch and had great service and good chelsea salad and so so minestrone soup.  garlic knots baked to perfection with tons of flavor and a nice crisp on the bottom.  so, i bragged it up to my family and took eight of us there for dinner on friday night!  mistake number 1 !  15 minutes for drink order,  ordered the same thing i had for lunch the day before and while the salad was good the soup was warm and garlic bread was a dough ball with no garlic slurry or crisp bottom.  complained to manager and she was full of excuses of the oven not being reliable!  slice of pizza was doughy!  antipasto salad had no toppings on it!  really?  11 people supposedly working with 8 customers and could never get their attention!  what an embarrassment!  new york would evict this pretender!  someone call the  real nypd and arrest them!"}
{"text":"Eight of us. All seniors. The service and attention we received could not have been better. I think every wait person in the place checked on us to see if we needed anything and how  we liked our pizza, which by the way was the best I've had in a long time. This is just a great Pizza place."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! The atmosphere is great and the staff really cares about their customers. Our pizzas came out a little crispier than we had wanted and they remade the pizzas for myself and friend! They were so wonderful and took 10 dollars off our bill and gave us a gift certificate for our next visit! The food was wonderful, especially the garlic knots!!! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Got wings and marguerita pizza w thin crust. It's the best option for delivery/takeout pizza in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"The server was nice. The food was mediocre. We ordered spaghetti, antipasto salad, and another salad. The main reason we won't be going back is because this business is against the Second Amendment, which some of us hold very high. The no gun sign on the door is a large deterrent for those of us that enjoy our rights in a state that still allows us to have them."}
{"text":"NYPD ranks up as one of my favorite pizza places in the valley. Their pizza and calzones are absolutely amazing; incredibly fresh ingredients all with their own unique twist. (Their italian sausage is to die for) The pizza is very traditional new york style - very thin crust, the focus is more on the ingridents.  What impresses me the most however is the prices are superb! You can get a 18\" pizza for about $10 with two toppings, amazing price!  For under $25 we had two sodas, an appetizer and a pizza that easily fed both of us (without the appetizer)  Highly highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, great lunch specials, had a slice & Cesar salad for like 8  bucks, Pizza wasn't bad but I prefer Chicago style and obviously this is NY style. Four Stars. will return."}
{"text":"My family and I have been dining here since it opened, and eat there weekly. Love their pizza's, the sauce is great. Try the Sicilian pizza with salami and onion, mushroom or black olives - fantastic! Their dessert Zeppolis are wonderful, I favor the caramel sauce while the rest of my family prefers the raspberry. Antipasto salad is great but sometimes needs extra dressing which the server is more than happy to get for you.  The managers and staff are very friendly and attentive, always willing to get you whatever you need. On the weekends if you arrive after 5:30 you're in for a wait. The parking lot is usually packed so park across the lot by Jo-Ann's instead of playing musical cars."}
{"text":"excellent place to have a pizza.  i have been coming here for several years now.   but what made tonight extra-special was a server named Meredith who was working upstairs.  she is just wonderful !"}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick pizza that is very good and the fresh ingredients make it complete, complimented by multiple beers on tap we have a winner!"}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza but at a high price. Two large pizzas,one plain, one pepperoni and a small salad to go....delivered.....$56 plus tip.  In Pennsylvania I get genuine NY pizza, large anywhere from $11 to $14. With weekday specials I can get a large pie and a dozen wings for under $19"}
{"text":"Great food and fast delivery service. Prices are decent. There's not Mich more to write about. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"It took me 30 minutes until my pizza was cool enough to put in my mouth without fear of scalding my tongue and rendering me mute. When I was able to safely eat my order it was very \"meh\". There's no real taste and it looks like they just pulled it out of a grease sauna.  The interior looks like they gutted a Chompies and tried to fill it in a quarter of the space.  The service was mediocre at best. For a place that small and with all the waiters going around, how hard is it to drop by the table more than twice?  There's nothing really NY about this place. The rape scene with Harvey Keitel in Bad Lieutenant would've been a more enjoyable and a NY experience than eating at this place was."}
{"text":"While the Hells Kitchen wings leave something to be desired in the heat department, they were still tasty. The pizza was awesome and Shelby, our waitress, was great. We were surprised at how empty it was for Super Bowl, but that worked fine for us!"}
{"text":"Been to other locations and had wonderful experience there. So I figured I would go here but it was a bad experience way to demanding for me to order as soon as we sat down so we got up and left."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE pizza place.  I am not a big fan of pizza yet I could eat here daily.  I prefer the white pizza with tomatoe slices but I will eat any vegetarian variety, including just cheese.  The eggplant sandwich is to die for and enough for two meals if you aren't a big eater.  I have to save room for the Ba Da Bing Chocolate cake.  The best cake I have ever had in my entire life."}
{"text":"Wow what a total disappointment here! I had a 1/2 hour wait at oreganos so I said I try Nypd next door! I tried their meat lovers pizza in 18 inch for 21.99 on menu.  It had mainly crust and could have been a 14 inch pie with the small amount of meat on it! A total ripoff no meat on meat lovers pie!  2 inches on each side had no meat. And for the same money I can get a 6 pound monster loaded at oreganos with enough meat to make 2 nypd meat lovers 18 inch pies at the same price point! The reason oreganos is always a wait is the food is great quality and huge in size every time! Fantastic customer service all things nypd neighbor is not. Nypd needs a lot of help here! I would not waste my hard earned money"}
{"text":"Crust was not chewy enough.  Sauce was a bit bland.  Toppings were good quality.  Service is good.  Prices are good."}
{"text":"I actually like the pizza here. I have been searching high and low for good pizza near my new home downtown. I'm in love with Rays Pizza and when you're in love you want nothing else but what you love. Went in pretty late on Saturday night and the place was packed. We ordered the cheese bread and that was pretty good. Next up was the white pizza. Very good. I was surprised! The crust was very good, crisp yet soft and it actually had some taste to it. The wait staff was very nice too but they were very busy trying to calm down the drunk cowboy fan. Kudos to them for trying to keep that jerk under check. Anyway, I will definitely head back again. I hear they deliver too!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little pizza place, one that I can see myself coming back to. I recently ordered the small Brooklyn pizza with some cheesy garlic knots. The crust was cooked nicely, with some tasty pepperoni, sausage and basil. The cheese on the knots didn't really stick well, but it was all pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Second trip was the charm. I ordered the garlic knots and chicken parmigiana, both were fantastic. Service was fast and efficient, especially for the fact that it was a Saturday night.   Rebecca, the manager, keeps the place clean and running smoothly.   My girlfriend ordered the penne with marinara and meatballs. And it was equally delicious!  Can't wait to try the chicken parmigiana on a sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"The place has a nice vibe and the service is very customer oriented. I was just stopping in for light snack and they treated very nicely for just a small tab. They go an extra mile for customers of all ages."}
{"text":"In town for a family visit from Boise, Idaho, I decided to try NYPD, as I had heard good things. I was not disappointed.  Casey was well-versed in the extensive menu, and not only did he find out what I liked, he made recommendations based on my preferences. The exchange felt personal, like he was truly getting to know me as a potential regular customer. Seriously, who does that nowadays?  The garlic knots he suggested were like crack; I couldn't get enough of them (not that I have personal experience with crack, but one hears things...). I didn't feel like pizza, and had pasta that unfortunately, was a little salty (hence merely 4 stars), but still tasty.  Since I too work in a pizza restaurant back in Boise, Casey and I geeked out hardcore about the filtration system NYPD has and gushed over our ovens. I mean, come ON! We nerded out over commercial baking appliances! That, honestly, on top of the great food, made my night.  I'll definitely have to come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"pretty good pizza place... i get take out from here alot... the \"pies\" are large and you can get anything on them... the salads are also good... i have never eaten in the restaurant but it is normally busy when i am there...  kinda expensive for pizza but i have not found a place i like better (la grande does not count!)"}
{"text":"I have ate here 3 times and I had always had great service. Service is very important, even if they have great food bad service can ruin all. I love their pizza as long as it is fresh if I can offer any advice only order what u can eat since the food does not taste as good the next day. If u plan on take out eat it before it gets cold. Great pizza but taste does not spend the night."}
{"text":"I have positive and negative points about this pizza joint.  I've heard the radio commercials for years.  The special water used to make the crust.  I've passed it up for years because of out of the way location.  But, finally the radio commercials convinced me to try.  I literally tried cold, on a whim, as I was driving around.  I didn't know the store's location or phone number, so dialed information to connect me.  The girl who took my order quoted me a price and a time my order would be ready.  She was kind enough to give me the corner the store was located.  The biggest negative was 2 slices of the medium pizza was burned.  The pizza was shown to me by the clerk, so I guess that's my fault for not catching it, but I'm surprised that the quality was not checked before reaching me.  Another thing that threw me were the sizes.  A medium is 16 not 14 as I assumed.  I ended up with 3 meals.  Fortunately the pizza heats up well.  I will say the pizza tasted good. The crust is light which I like.  And, the ingredients are of good quality.  I would not dissuade any one else from trying, but there wasn't enough of WOW factor here to bring me back."}
{"text":"After my first review I will send a certificate I barely got a chance to go. I sat at the table where I had a server name Jen. Ordered my pizza with all the toppings I had never seen an 18 inch pizza so big with all the delicious hot toppings. I was so pleased. I got to meet Chris which I think was a manager at I would check on me a couple of times to see how you were doing. Will I be going back most definitely!"}
{"text":"I did delivery first. It was faster than quoted time, and food was very hot still. We also went back for lunch and service was also quick and friendly. Great service especially considering it was busy lunch rush. Lots of pizza competition in this area but NYPD definitely the best for true NY style pizza with thin crust and fast."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza was super yummy and Denyelle was very knowledgeable about cross contamination procedures.  No place can give a 100% guarantee, but I'll be coming back here with my Celiac daughter as this location takes allergies seriously.  For the non- GF eaters the pesto pizza was delicious and the garlic knots are out of this world."}
{"text":"Excellent! Pizza was great. We stopped in for lunch and grabbed a couple of slices. Finished it off with a cannoli,-also excellent. The service was great. The food was fresh and the place was clean"}
{"text":"Loved the pizza here. We've had the blanco, Brooklyn and the one with pineapple and ham. Brooklyn is my definite favorite. I find a lot of places are hit or miss with a white pizza, this one was pretty good though. As a beer lover, they had tasty beverages from one of our favorite local breweries Phoenix Ale Brewery. Great pairing!"}
{"text":"Love the Brooklyn slice day or night. This company is so impressive with their toy drive for Cardon Children;s Medical Center. Thank you for helping kids in our community!"}
{"text":"Just finished eating pizza here. It was awesome. Very reminiscent of pizza from NY and NJ. Wish we had an NYPD in grand rapids, Michigan! Please..."}
{"text":"We come here every Friday night and we are never disappointed.  The food is great and the service is unbeatable,  shout out to our waitress Courtney for always taking care of us."}
{"text":"This is a very nice,warm,and friendly spot to get some very good food. To start,tried many of their items,it's hard to get me to do wings(being a cook of some very popular wings),got to say that I was very pleased with what was placed in front of me. Did the honey BBQ,you would think that it's easy to do,not at all. You get a very nice BBQ sauce with just the right amount of sweet honey.    Ordered a small size pizza for the wife and myself. Very nice size,easily feed the two of us,plus a cpl of slices for later.    Finished the meal with a nice slice of lemon cake (for me) and cheese cake(wifey),all I can say is that the lemon is RIGHT ON POINT!!!  The service there is so friendly, if you have any questions they're able to help and answer, the Ambiance inside is very warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"I love this place.   Love how thin the crust is Weighed down with soggy greasy cheese n stuff.  I also love their buffalo wings. And caesar salads.  It's my favorite.  Truly."}
{"text":"Now open, the awesome NYPD Pizza!! The closest you're going to get to NY pizza!! Becky and the crew really hooked it up! My new favorite pizza place!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and nice location, clean and well kept. Ordered pizzas for pick-up.  The cheese pizza was very tasty, even as left overs - the little that was left - and the kids loved it.  The \"da works\" pizza was soggy - even though they made the crust extra crispy at their suggestion - and something on the toppings may have been undercooked.  We'd definitely do the cheese pizza next time without hesitation.  Others have said the Sicilian is great so maybe the thin cheese for the kids and thick pizza for the adults!"}
{"text":"My daughter called in a pizza order. Nothing fancy, large pepperoni, the usual. She was told the pizza would be ready in 35-40 minutes.  Upon our arrival I was told that the order had never been received. I am positive the Surprise location was called and even know the name of the girl who took the order but we didn't want to get anyone in trouble.  The manager took customer service to the next level! I'm not easily impressed but honestly, he knocked my socks off!!!!  I was told that a pizza would be ready for me in 8 minutes. I said ok and went to wait in my car with my daughter and dog.  Not only was my steaming hot pizza ready in 8 minutes, but delivered to my car by the manager himself!!!  That simple act of superior customer service has bought a loyal customer forever!!!  Do yourself a favor- run, do not walk to NYPD on Bell & Litchfield Rd. The pizza is a little pricier than other local places, but it is delicious and the service is beyond reproach!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, great staff and quality toppings. This makes my top 5 pizza places. Monday & Tuesday is 50% off second pizza!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but the service provided by our waitress Sabra was honestly the worst I've ever experienced. I never will be back..ill wait 30 min for oreganos next time. If you get Sabra make sure to know what your having before you sit and do not ask for anything or be prepared for a dramatic eye roll and a huff. Hey Sabra, no ones making you work in the service industry. There are other jobs that don't involve customer service for people just like you."}
{"text":"I like in Ahwatukee.  I like nypd  And this location delivers to my place!  Huzzah!  I like thin crust soggy type pizza, and this fits the bill. I prefer the Brooklyn.  Sausage, pepperoni, sauce, cheese and fresh basil.  Deeelish!"}
{"text":"NYPD makes a good pizza.  The place can be crowded some days, quiet the next.  The primary reason I enjoy their pizza is that they seem to do a great job with vegetables on pizza.   Their sandwiches aren't bad, but the pizza is the reason to visit."}
{"text":"Love this little pizza restaurant! Always great food... the pizza is fabulous and the kitchen always comes out to make sure the crispness is just right before they slice it... delicious garlic knots. No complaints! Been here several times.. super fast lunches and great desserts."}
{"text":"The food here has declined severely! I've only ever had one issue with a salad here back last August and the manager was kind and sent me a coupon/flyer for a replacement next time. I have ordered pizzas since then several times and on all occasions the pizza was great. Tonight I ordered a personal pepperoni pizza and a small greek salad.  Upon ordering Brody seemed to struggle over the phone putting the order in the computer. When I arrived to pick up my order the \"manager\" was amongst a group of servers standing in a circle at the other end of the counter just visiting. One female server in the group yelled across the dining room to another server trying to greet a table that they had already been taken care of. Tone was demeaning and clearly not nice. Manager does nothing and carries on leaning against the counter. The girl helping me now has to ask someone to make the salad I ordered 25 minutes prior. It was clear she was new so I simply thanked her for getting me a fresh salad. She then needed help on the register with the salad coupon and called over to the manager. No response, calls her again and she comes over. She doesn't even acknowledge I'm standing there and has zero smile. She seemed truly not happy! Almost pissed off was the impression I got. With what seemed like several green employees on the floor you'd think she'd be more friendly and present on the floor as to set an example.  Back to the food, pizza looked good when presented and the salad was all bagged up so I headed home. Pizza sauce tasted off, kind of bland and not as usual. The small greek salad was exceptionally small. Only filled about 1/2 the small container but that's not the only issue. I'll have to assume the salad was small because they were running out of quality lettuce. \" see picture\" This was all throughout my salad and not very appetizing. Not a good recovery on a prior bad salad I'd say. Also they were out of lids so my salad was wrapped in plastic wrap. Not a big deal but when customer service is lacking, food quality and quantity standards aren't being upheld and supplies aren't being properly ordered I'd say there's a problem."}
{"text":"At his request, I messaged \"Richard S: through Yelp and also e-mailed him directly so I could better describe our visits.    I never got any response whatsoever.  So, here's the message:  \"Richard S\", If you don't want to hear the details of customers' experiences, you should not ask people to spend their time contacting you.  PS.  Yes, I took away one more star."}
{"text":"We were regulars. Then...new owners take over and slowly started changing recipes and using sub-par ingredients. There is so much competition in the area. Won't go back ever again."}
{"text":"I love NYPD Pizza, and last night we went, and there was a snafu, it happens.they had a HUGE rush all at once and were running behind.  What was impressive was way they handled it. The waiter was over checking on us, and making sure we had refills and that everything was okay. When the pizza came (it was only about 10 min more than usual) it was as GOOD as ever! NYPD never fails to please.  Get the Big Kahuna and Garlic Knots...you wont be sad!"}
{"text":"So today was Italian day! My colleagues and I decided to go to NYPD. I haven't been there before but they said they loved it so I thought I'll give it a try.  Everyone ordered pizza so their orders were out very quickly. I ordered Chicken Parmigiana instead so it was a few more minutes before my food was out. I also ordered a side house salad with balsamic dressing.  Overall, the food was very good. There were a couple of parts of the chicken that felt a little undercooked but everything else tasted good. The bread was delicious. I loved that they had three of them on my plate. The salad was also fresh; the lettuce was very crips and the croutons tasted great as well.  My colleagues enjoyed their pizzas too so good experience all in all. Good option for lunch since they serve the food pretty quick and prices in general are reasonable."}
{"text":"It's okay... Doesn't wow me but cures a pizza craving. It's walking distance from my house and that's why I do"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Customer service is above and beyond! And of course the pizza is fantastic! Best in Phoenix!! Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"I think this is a great place. I have been there a half dozen times and the service is always good, as is the food. They have a great selection of specialty pizzas. Usually, I do not get garlic knots out because they are too greasy, but not here. They are delicious, without being greasy.   This has become my regular pizza lunch place. Someday, I have to try it for dinner."}
{"text":"After living in the valley for over 10 years I finally made my way to Avondale recently while scoping out locations for my next Hawaiian Experience Spa. One day I stopped at NYPD pizza for lunch and it was so good I went back again when I was back in Avondale a few days later.  The service was quick and friendly and the menu had lots of options. My wife got a Strawberry Fields? salad because she is watching calories and she loved it. It really looked good. I tried the margarita pizza the first time and the bruschetta pizza the second time. Both where excellent.   There is a bar but it was lunch time and we were working so we just got water. :( Speaking of lunch, there is a lunch menu M-F which has pizza by the slice.  If we open a new day spa in Avondale or a new day spa in Goodyear (which is a block away) NYPD Pizza looks like it will become a regular stop for us. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I normally travel all the way out to Coolidge for authentic New York style pizza. NYPD will not replace it, but it certainly will be a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"This place if fantastic! They serve up the best New York Style pizza in town and have a fun and friendly atmosphere. I have always had great service when I have gone in. Their Garlic Knots are the BEST appetizer on the menu and the Chelsea Chop salad is to die for! If your looking for a great night out, you should definitely try this place!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, but the service and management is what really impressed me. I had one of those rare experiences where the staff went over the top and created an experience we will not forget. Very friendly greeting and excellent service. When the pizza was delivered we asked for Tabasco sauce. The waiter said he would check. The waiter came back and informed us they were out of Tabasco, but it would be here soon. We said it is okay, not to worry. The manager came over a few seconds later and apologized for not having the Tabasco and said he had sent someone to get it. Two minutes later someone delivered a new bottle to our table. Even though the experience was rare for us, I have a feeling that is the way this restaurant does business as usual."}
{"text":"Great delivery and take out. Great Wings, Salads and Sandwiches. If you want something really good, get the Brooklyn family Pizza or the Louie Prima Calzone. The restaurant looks clean and comfortable. I didn't have any issues with deliveries of take out.   Go here if you like Pepperoni, Sliced Sausage (not the cheap crumbled one) and fresh basil on a pizza or Tomato, mushroom, cheese and spinach in a calzone!"}
{"text":"I actually really like this location. It's got a great bar and friendly employees. Pizza is better than average. I hope this place lasts because it's the best pizza joint on Mill"}
{"text":"this is our fourth visit and we love it every time. the food is delicous and the pizza tastes just like the real deal in Italy. we highly recommend this place. never over crowded, always very friendly and you can linger and visit. they have a good selection of wines to make your meal even better."}
{"text":"This place is great!....One of the best Calzones I ever ate.....and I grew up in the Philadelphia area that has some of the best Italian food! I always get take out, and the staff are very helpful and pleasant!"}
{"text":"This place claims NY style pizza however the pizza is undercooked unless you ask them to make it well done. this pizzas here take a very long time to cook, and there is no by the slice option on weekends.  In addition to pizzas of various types there are calzones and standard Italian fair all at fairly low prices.   The sauce is not too sweet, the cheese is decent when well done but the crust is lacking with the pizza. It is nice to see granulated garlic a standard condiment on the tables as it helps to add some much needed flavor.  The atmosphere is casual and it is a sit down style dining on night and weekends. During the day one has the option to get a quick meal from the pickup counter.   As pizza goes in AZ this place is better than most, however it is still far from the best pizza ever."}
{"text":"This is one of the pizza places we order from on our pizza night rotations. They have the thin crust NY style pizza (hence the name). I haven't had a pizza combination here I didn't enjoy. My favorites are the philly steak and the meatball. Slices are huge, I'm usually good with one, two if I'm starving. Toppings are disperse evenly and the leftovers are good cold or reheated in the oven.  They also have tasty wings and garlic knots. Most of the time they offer you a cup for a complimentary drink at the fountain when you order take out."}
{"text":"Coda B. and I don't go out for pizza very often. This is for 2 reasons. 1. Coda likes Domino's. 2. I like, nay, LOVE mushrooms on pizza (among other delicious vegetable toppings) while Coda prefers his pizza be served with toppings that, at one point, had a face. I'm not a vegetarian by any means (see my review of Blue Nile for proof), I just strongly prefer veggies on my pizza. I feel the tastes compliment each other better, and it's also much prettier. Neither of us is a big fan of compromise, so splitting a pizza is usually a challenge.   NYPD took the pain out of pizza for us. We ordered a 14\" 5-topping and our AMAZING server let us know that, if we so desired, we could do 5 toppings on one half and 5 DIFFERENT toppings on the other, at no additional charge. I wanted to kiss her feet. I don't think she realized how far we would take it though, as our respective halves did not share one topping. That's right, we don't mess around. At this point in the meal, my Yelp rating of NYPD was 5 stars. Of course, I still had to eat the pizza.     It is utterly confusing to me how so many places can claim to serve \"New York\" pizza and fail miserably, while almost every pizza place actually located in New York manages to pull it off. It's as if something magical happens when pizza is prepared in a new york zip code, and it's nearly impossible to recreate. But people keep trying. NYPD did not successfully recreate New York pizza. However, for Arizona pizza NYPD is definitely up there. And no, I've never waited 4 hours for pizza.  Four stars for the food and cute, albeit somewhat gimmicky, ambiance. Five stars for the service. Our server was incredible, and they even gave us a gift bag when we left! It had coupons and a magnet! I used to order from a Chinese delivery place solely because they gave you little trinkets with your order, and I do order happy meals every so often so yeah, I guess you can say I'm a fan of gifts with food. So thanks for the magnet, New York Pizza Department. I will be back."}
{"text":"As far as take out goes, this is true NYC style pizza.  I had two slices of the cheese for lunch today, and I can't wait to eat it again!!!"}
{"text":"The Pizza was delicious, however ordered delivery and after 1 hour and NO SHOW, I called and they said they had delivered it to me already, NOT. After the second hour I got my Pizza.   Didn't appreciate them accusing me of telling a lie to get a free pizza. The nerve. When the delivery guy finally showed up he admitted to me that he gave my Pizza to the wrong address but they paid for it?? Nobody from NYPD called to apologize for the mix up and calling me a liar.   The person on the phone said and I quote, \"we have to look out for people that lie to get free pizzas\" BTW, I paid for my Pizza (gladly) and so did the person who got my first order.  Don't order delivery and you will be just fine.Maybe they should get GPS instead of upsetting customers.   Does that sound like good business?"}
{"text":"First time I came here I got a calzone. Didn't like it cause it had ricotta cheese. I was not used to that. Next I tried the pizza and I love the Brooklyn pizza. Also tried the pasta these were ok not bad not great. Do like that fact they are a Pepsi affiliate restaurant. And the family all LOVES the zeppolis."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and cannoli . So impressed with this restaurant. Some of the best pizza I've enjoyed in a long time!! The delivery guy was great too!!! Thanks for a great food experience!"}
{"text":"While I love the food, the dine in service at lunch today was ridiculously slow.  Order to go don't dine in.   Update: after posting, I was contacted with an apology for service. Most places stop there. But NYPD pizza sent me a gift certificate. I guess some people do still believe in the concept of customer service!"}
{"text":"Came to Arizona to run Rock n Roll Arizona and as part of Team Pizza Racers I had to get pizza my first day. I chose NYPD because it was close to my hotel and got good reviews. I ordered takeout at the register and the people were super friendly and fun. I got the small chicken Pesto and it was really good. As good as most pizza I get in my neck of the woods in NY. Definitely a great choice even with the rush hour traffic."}
{"text":"My family frequents this NYPD location for dinner and we're never disappointed. The service and food are always top notch. Our servers are consistently friendly and attentive and management regularly comes around to make sure all is well with our visit. The pizza, appetizers and seasonal salads are always good. I highly recommend NYPD Avondale!"}
{"text":"This is not pizza! I have had better pizza out of the freezer! The crust is hard and flavorless. There is no chewiness to it whatsoever. The cheese is flavorless and the sauce is something else.  I have nothing good to say about this place. It's just a pizza place and for some reason people seem to like it? But if your a true pizza lover, this is soo not the place for you. There is much much better out there. Find it!"}
{"text":"Pizza tastes good just pricey, do not like when waiter/waitresses only address the man at the family table.and not ask or look at everyone else sitting there if they would like something else also. Why because they think he is paying the bill, not sure...."}
{"text":"Food is great but the best part is the service. Keith is awesome - very friendly, mentioned all the specials for the day and even the week. Would def recommend!"}
{"text":"Katie is fabulous! She is very friendly and nice! Awesome hostess!  She came around and asked if I wanted a drink and ask for anything else!  I really recommend her to be waited by her! U will have a fabulous experience ! U rock kittty cat!"}
{"text":"$7 for a couple of slices and a pop is a good deal.  The place is very clean and service is good"}
{"text":"We love this pizza. When we go down to spring training, we have to stop and get some NYPD pizza. Now if NYPD would open up in Colorado, we'd be happier"}
{"text":"I was very excited to finally come to NYPD because I have been hearing about it for a very long time. There was 4-6 tables in the restaurant which was not very busy at 7pm on a Thursday, so I assumed my order would be completed quickly. Unfortunately I was wrong. After 20 minutes of waiting I asked the bartender if she could check on my food. 10 minutes later I walked up to the counter myself to ask what was going on. I could see that part of my order was bag with my name on it sitting under a heat lamp, and the manager Jenn, let me know that my pizza had been done for a while and was on top of the oven. I let her know that this was my first time in and needless to say I was not impressed at this point. She asked me what I would like to do and I let her know that all I wanted was to make sure that I had fresh food to take. Jen had my order remade and record-breaking time and I can happily say that I was also gifted with a coupon for the next pizza to be on the house. This is a prime example of what customer service should look like an NYPD pizza should be proud to have a manager like Jenn at the helm of that restaurant. A true team is when one member may Fumble, while another picks up the ball and runs in for the winning score! Great job by NYPD and fantastic time! I will always speak very highly of this establishment!"}
{"text":"Is this the trend to hire only Mexicans that are beauty school drop outs and can't even cook a pizza? This place is a joke because of who's cooking .... Seriously clueless"}
{"text":"This is likely the last time we eat from here. We've been ordering from here often for the last year or so. Started off great but about 2-3 months ago the quality started going downhill. It started with wrong orders, then ordering gluten free but getting regular, sicilian pizza delivered raw and we could only eat the edge pieces, now a GF salad pizza crust burnt to a crisp and inedible so they're sending a new one (so I'll eat after everyone's done). EDIT: I spoke to a manager at 6:17pm offering to send a new GF pizza - insistent it only takes 7min...its 1 hour later and still no pizza. I only live 10min away...for sure our last order here.  After a recent dine-in experience and seeing all the people in the kitchen were very young and goofing around the whole time (albeit nothing wrong with that if still producing good food), but when the quality of food you produce is suffering then it's time for a change. Seeing the recent reviews it seems that others have noticed the change in quality as well."}
{"text":"My girl and I are hard core health nuts.  Translation:  Doing the math we eat pizza 2 times a year.  Once in her birthday and once when when we go back east.   Only.  We just each had our own small pie and cherished every bite till there was nada left.  Anywhere.  That's after having their cranberry pear almond small salad to start.  He Small is an 8 slice 14\" equivalent to most mediums elsewhere.    In short- our long time top dog \"Papa Gino's\" from Boston.. just got officially knocked off.   So go here if it's the last meal you have on earth.  Order it on death row.  Do favors for it.  Anything!  And...  Don't mess around. Do the cheese pizza STRAIGHT UP.   You won't be let down.   I varied mine only by adding asiago cheese to the already perfect blend they use.    Nice tip to appreciate the ingredients and their recipe: ask for a warm cup of the piZza sauce (not marinara) so u can dip that perfectly flavored textured and thickened crust and taste the sauce in its pure state.    Or better yet.. A side or five of the garlicky ranch dressing.    Brilliant.  P.s.  The two gentlemen that sat down behind us were legit old school Italian guys ON CAMELBACK! Speaking Italian throughout dinner.   Not a bad endorsement right there!"}
{"text":"This is best place to have a date, service is the best atmosphere is comfortable. Manger and staff is a 10+."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. Service was excellent and pizza was delicious! We will definitely be back. Highly recommend the bruchetta pizza and garlic knots."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised here and my family was as well. I ordered the pizza with salad on top and they were nice enough to switch out the dairy cheese with the vegan cheese. The salad was plentiful with lots of toppings. Our server was attentive and helpful. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty dank if you ask me. Got a selfie from one of the waiters for my friend. (Get the ravioli)"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza, salad and wings.   Alexis was amazing.  Service was super quick and friendly."}
{"text":"They have a decent pizza and chicken parmasean. This place is A-OK in my book. I would rate NYPD Pizza 3 1/2 stars but felt it was closer to 3 stars than 4 stars."}
{"text":"This review is only based on take out pizza.   NYPD Pizza is a local pizza chain with twelve individually owned locations in the valley. They offer New York Style Pizza made with genuine New York Water.  We took out two pizzas and found some difference between the personal size and the small size. Our personal size pizza was tasty but had a much thicker dough ratio to toppings than the small size.  Both of us were most found of the small size \"Blanca\" (white pizza that was 1/2 tomatoes and half spinach) While the pizza didn't remind me of a genuine New York Slice it was a very tasty unique pizza. The crust was thin and chewy and very light. The toppings were delicious and  extra seasoning wasn't needed. The spinach was actually fresh spinach and you could tell it wasn't from frozen. The pizza was so light I could eat three slices without that over filled feeling that I get from some other pizzas.  The pizzas we tried were hot, fresh and tasty.  I'd recommend the small size over the personal size because of the topping to dough ratio."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this place since it first opened and we could walk over from school at lunch. Recently returned to Scottsdale from being out of state for a few years and it is every bit as good as I remember. Sure it takes a little longer than other places and it costs a little bit more but that is the price you pay for a superior product. In the past I always went with my standard of pepperoni and mushrooms but recently I had their pesto pizza with chicken. Very very good.  I always have a mental debate between nypd and grimaldis but I would say they are both on par. Will be back soon...."}
{"text":"I was approached by the area director Josh McGee, he had followed up with the store to see what happened. I guess the store wasn't aware of their new policy, the whole order has to be 15 dollars which includes tax and delivery. Also, the girl that was on the phone was just a trainee. He apologized about what happen and explained that the team now knows the correct policy and procedures. It was great that they actually contacted me, it made me feel valued as a customer. So they get their 5 stars back, because they actually do deserve it. Not only for having great delicious food but also for their great customer service."}
{"text":"1st time at NYPD last night. Our son has been talking about it and my husband loves NY style Pizza so we went. They welcomed us like we were the most important customers. Courteous, welcoming, hospitable. Our wait person Sunny is amazing. Pizza is Fab. Sandwiches are Fab. Will go back again."}
{"text":"Second visit to this location,  first visit was not good but the second visit was much better.  The service was great and the food was cooked exactly as we ordered. The server checked in on us throughout our visit and ensured we were taken care of."}
{"text":"Great desserts!! The service is usually slow but the food is on point. I usually get a calzone and finish it off with one of their amazing desserts especially the zippolies"}
{"text":"We ordered tonight a Fran's Favorite thin style and crispy. Wow we all loved. By far this is the best I've had here. We will be back!! Check them out."}
{"text":"Awesome. Food was great. Atmosphere was great. Our server Christian was amazing too. Will be for sure coming back to this place again...."}
{"text":"This is an update. I took my family in for dinner today and we had such a great time. Bry (Bree?) was such a fantastic server! She was funny and very attentive. Great service. We started with the artichoke dip which I HIGHLY recommend. It was so good I stopped short of licking the bowl clean. We split a large Cesar salad between 3 of us and it was perfect. For the main entree, we all got a personal pizza. Mine was the bruschetta and it was so good! My daughter got the pesto chicken pizza and she loved it. My husband got the bbq chicken pizza, he liked it but didn't rave about it. My son got something with pepperoni and sausage and he liked his. I really liked the crust. Our only complaint about the pizza's is that most of the sauce and toppings seemed to be very concentrated toward the middle with a lot of crust around the edges. I think it would be better if the toppings went further out and less crust around the edges (if that makes sense). We had cannoli and carmel cheesecake for dessert. VERY yummy! Especially the cheesecake. Overall a great experience. We will be back. AND it's a pokestop! Bonus!"}
{"text":"great pizza i always get the brooklyn and am satisfied everytime. the only thing i think they can work on is their delivery times maybe. not sure why but it takes them a minimum of an hour to get the pizza to my apt even though i live only a couple blocks away."}
{"text":"My first time eating there and I must say it was awesome!!! I created my own calzone and it was so good. I got the vegetarian pizza for my kids and  they loved it. I'm going back tonight to get my another Calzone. This time I'm getting a large one."}
{"text":"I will never eat at this one again. I will go to the other one on Camelback. The calzone I ordered didn't have any meat in it just all cheese. I live to far to take it back. Then as I was walking outback I seen the RAT trap box outside so that tells me they have rodent issues. I will not be back thank you but no thank you."}
{"text":"Very good food! I had a pepperoni pizza with jalapeños delicious the only down fall was the food took a very long time to come out. Server was very nice. The place is Very clean neat nice not a bunch of kids running around classy pizza joint! Will for sure go back to this place again!!"}
{"text":"The service was great. Waitress was very friendly and nice but our pizza came out very soggy and asked them to crisp it up a little came back exactly the same. They remade the pizza for us and the second pizza  as the same way. We come here at least once a week and the pizza has never been this bad. Not sure if they have new cooks but management is absolutely different. The manager kept starring at us and glaring and not once did he come over and apologize or even bring out the new pizza to us. Honestly the worst experience we have ever had here tonight."}
{"text":"I love love LOVE their pizza I love thin crust pizza  NYPD does awesome thin crust pizza  Love it.  Their lunch special gets you a small salad, a slice of pizza and a drink for $5 It's the perfect meal.  I usually only get their cheese and mushroom pizza, its simple and perfection.    Their hot wings are pretty damn tasty too"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Phoenix. I love it there and all the waitstaff are very nice. I usually sit at the bar and have a few slices with some beer, but is also seems like a good place for first dates or even families."}
{"text":"Only reason why we tried this place, because we were in the area. Place is not to bad, I've had better especially in Cali. I am searching for that spot in Arizona still! Haven't found it yet. Girls like their salads, Pizza was good, enjoyed their garlic knots! I would and will come back again."}
{"text":"Okay - first the good news - the pizza is so good they must put CRACK in the sauce. From the cheese to the crust, to the sauce, it's good old back East style thin yet chewy crust with real, nutty mozzarella and mild yet flavorful sauce. We literally got take out of this pizza for like 3 weeks in a row on Fridays till we got tired of no delivery availability (yes - as typical Amercians, we got SO lazy that not only do we not want to COOK the dinner, we also don't want to leave the couch to get it.)  Now the bad news: Mostly everything else, and especially the service. On our last visit, we had the misfortune of having a waiter named Sinjin, (I kid you not) who had to be the last Neanderthal walking around the planet. He forgot what we wanted, we reminded him, he forgot to bring things we ordered, we reminded him; he forgot who got what, forgot to refill ANY drinks, and ultmimately forgot we had a coupon even though we reminded him throughout the meal, which resulted in another 20 minute wait while he tried to retrain himself to use the cash register. (We literally saw him scratching his head over the register as though it were some foreign object ready to bite him if he pecked the keys any more aggressively).  Sinjin (and what the hell kind of a name is that anyway? We are in Arrowhead, not the freakin' British Aisles! I think Sean McLaughlin's family had a hand in naming this one) was the last straw for our dining outings to NYPD.   My husband thought we should tip him SOMETHING, in hopes he would use it for a brain transplant at some time, but I insisted on leaving him a big fat ZERO with some pointed remarks about remembering at least ONE thing your diners ask of you during the course of an entire 80-dollar meal. My husband now refuses ever to set foot in there again out of sheer possible embarrassment of being known as one time Non Tippers. Sorry, but I ALWAYS tip generously when the service is good. When it's bad or nonexistent, the waitstaff needs to know it.  We now get take out, and only for the actual pizza, and only I venture in there myself with my non-tipper scarlet letter emblazoned on my chest. (not really - I saw \"Waiting! I use dark glasses and a Father Guido Sarducci mustache now! No pubes on MY pizza!)  On other menu items here: Everything else is, well, so-so, or as my Italian grandmother would say, mezz-a-mezz (wavering  hand motion included). Take the pizza home and leave the rest of that train wreck at NYPD."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the Pizza Blanca again last night. He came home exclaiming how awesome the service is at this location and even went as far to say that it's the best service he's received in years!   Apparently he was greated by a hostess who opened the door for him, while another pleasant hostess assisted him as he entered the door. He was even offered a complimentary cup of pop. That went over BIG with him as he was very thirsty and appreciated having a beverage to enjoy while waiting for his order to be ready.  It's hard to find an establishment that offers delicious food AND excellent service these days. KUDOS to NYPD pizza!!"}
{"text":"So much fun when Justin is there! The bruschetta is great, and the service is amazing."}
{"text":"I travel often for business, and often order a pizza for dinner.  I try not to ever order from the national chains.  I landed on NYPD pizza based on yelp reviews.  i was not disappointed.  Awesome.  And very true to real NY style pizza.  I ordered a pepperoni, sausage, feta and garlic.  every bite was perfect.  crust was soft, sauce was good, all around a great pie.  If i come this way again, I'll call again.  Based on reviews, I decided to pickup.  I can see why delivery could be slow.  It was 1.5 miles from my hotel, took about 15 mins to get there at 6:30p on a thurs,    Staff was very friendly and helpful.  when i pulled up and got out of the car, the smell was amazing.  I knew i made the right choice."}
{"text":"Great pizza-calzones-salads are AMAZING!! Friendly !!  Beer and Wine!! Good lunch specials!  Had one issue with delivery one time and the manager fixed the problem immediately!!  Kid friendly!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to try a new pizza place in AZ, we have been here a little over a year, we moved from Western PA, and have been pretty particular about our pizza out here.  I have to say this pizza is the best I've had out here, by far. We had a Sicilian style pizza, and the entire pie was delicious, crust was perfect, toppings were fresh and full of flavor, and cooked perfectly.  Service was great and atmosphere was very chill.  Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I've ordered out and dined in several times and their food is delicious.  I am usually willing to try new things, but when I go here I just want the same thing.  I start off with a small Chelsea Salad, which can be a whole meal if you get the large size and put chicken in it.  But it also is topped with almonds, bacon, cheese and a creamy dressing to die for.  I usually save room for a 14\" pizza that is split between my husband and I.  I can still eat half, even with the salad and several toppings.  The price is not bad, but the food is good!  There is an option for a 5 topping pizza for $17.00.  Their beer selection is average, but it's better than not having any beer at all to go with delish food."}
{"text":"We have ordered pizza here to-go twice and always love it.  It is always hot and fresh.  Tastes great! I always make sure we get the garlic knots as well because they are delicious!!  So I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"I don't know what idiot staff you've hired in the last year, but you need to teach your kitchen what EXTRA well done pizza is as my pizza is still so soggy my toppings are falling off. Not AT ALL New York grade pizza."}
{"text":"Being from the NY/NJ area, this is about as close to home as it gets. It's similar in taste and quality but still missing the wood brick oven taste. The place is dimly lit, sparsely decorated. Several booths and tables with an open kitchen. I've yet to see a cook \"throw\" a pizza up in the air. I ordered the bruschetta pizza. It came relatively quick. It was light, fresh and the ricotta cheese has NO SUGAR ADDED! Whew! So many places in AZ think you need to add sugar. This is only for deserts fools! Happy they get what real Italians do well here. A definite place for me to get my home town food fix."}
{"text":"Great pizza - great calazone's - don't care for the garlic cheese knots."}
{"text":"My family have been here a number of times and the food has always been great! Pizza sizes are good. Prices are a bit high for extra toppings in my opinion. My only real complaint is the kids Mac n cheese. They make it watered down....for what reason, I dunno???? My daughter doesn't like it but they both loved the Alfredo! So tell your kids to stick with that and you will have a good time. :)"}
{"text":"Four star update for the Manager, Josh playin phone tag with me until he got a hold of me to get my input on my last dining experience. This shows true customer service and that NYPD wanted to make things right. Coincidentally, I got the same original server and things went smoothly this time around. I appreciated the call and the kind gesture."}
{"text":"Dont let the 3 star fool you. Great pizza.  But when they changed management I stopped going."}
{"text":"I love this little joint! It is a very cozy atmosphere and the food is great. I always get a calzone, it is worth the wait. They also have a great variety of salads, which I enjoy. I have also tried the garlic cheese knots, which I would not order again. The canolis are amazing!"}
{"text":"All across the board, 4 stars. My wife ordered penne pasta with marinara and I got the baked ziti with sausage. The only drawback is the food is loaded with garlic. That was fine for me, loved the ziti. My wife returned the pasta and got a slice of pizza. The waitress/hostess was very nice. The manager came over and removed the pasta from the check.  For desert we had the cheesecake and some cannoli. Again, a solid 4. I would come back. Be mindful of the garlic if you're not a huge fan of it."}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment. The pizza was simply horrible, the salad disgusting and low quality but the wings weren't bad.  Just the same with so many great places around I won't be back."}
{"text":"Save your money and go to the freezer section of your local grocery store. Some of those are far tastier.  You can call yourself NY all you want but no one in NY would ever eat this distasteful cardboard."}
{"text":"We had such a great time @ NYPD.  The pizza was great.  Caroline and Jose were such great servers and very nice.  Cannot wait to come back next year."}
{"text":"This pizza joint is always my go to! Amazing food! The staff is great. Always smiling and willing to go the extra mile."}
{"text":"A Great Pie At A Great Price!  On every visit to NYPD I am seated promptly, and the service is always outstanding. There has never been a time where I had to wait for anything.  The staff is very accommodating.   As a native from NYC I can be pretty picky when it comes to my pizza. I really enjoy a good slice of NY style pizza folded in half loaded with toppings and NYPD never fails me.   NYPD serves up an authentic pie with just the right amount of seasonings, a tasty blend of oregano and basil. Topped with a  fabulous sauce and NYPD  never scrimps on the toppings. Their pizza's are loaded. Not to mention, as an extra bonus, a NYPD pizza holds up as a great leftover, even when reheated unlike many other pizzas west of the city.  I have never been disappointed in an NYPD Pizza and will always go back for a slice or two!"}
{"text":"NYPD Never Disappoints  On every visit to NYPD I am seated promptly and the service is always outstanding.  There has never been a time where I had to wait for anything and  the staff at NYPD is very accommodating.   As a New Yorker I can be pretty picky when it comes to my pizza. I really enjoy a good slice of New York style pizza folded in half and loaded with toppings and NYPD never fails me.   NYPD serves up an authentic pie with just the right amount of Oregano and Basil seasoning.  On top of the fabulous sauce  NYPD never skimps on ingredients.  This pizza has lots and lots of toppings and your leftover pizza is even better tasting the next day when reheated, you can't say that about just any pizza.  I am never disappointed with NYPD I guess that's why I keep on coming back for more."}
{"text":"Well, unfortunately I am just out of their delivery range but I do occasionally go in for a carry out and of all the \"NY Style Pizzas\" in Tempe, this is one of the best. Their service is always great and the pizza is delicious"}
{"text":"Foodie and service snob: Excellent service, good pizza great wings. Phone guy found out we had a death in the family, even though driver had car in shop and was driving a rental: awesome attitude and attention to detail on phone and delivery. Highly recommend..."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I enjoyed the pizza and appetizers. The Caprese Bruchetta was very good, and my friend got a Calzone that was the size of a football. The waiter was new but extremely friendly as were all of the wait staff that were around that we talked to since the place was not very busy.  This is good man food."}
{"text":"Our meal got off to a little bit of a rocky start when they seated us and forgot about us. After 10 minutes of waiting, seeing other people be seated and their drink orders taken and watching some servers stand around I went back up to the man who seated us and let him know. The waitress followed me back to our table and took our order. After that our experience was a good one. We ordered wings and a large pizza. Our wings were hot and juicy. Our pizza was very good. The server was very attentive and our drinks were always full. No pictures of our pizza it was half gone by the time I got back from washing my hands."}
{"text":"I've been going to NYPD for years. First just for Pizza, then for diversity of menu for family members. I've always left there happy."}
{"text":"After writing about my negative experience, I received a follow up call from Angel the manager and also received a direct message from the CEO. Right away, I could see they take such reviews very seriously and I greatly appreciate it. I know it's just pizza, you eat it and get on with your day, but this is a product and a company and there are people behind every bite.  I believe they deserve a good written review and I applaud both the manager and CEO for being so quick to follow up. After all, I'm a nobody. I just write Yelp reviews when I feel it's absolutely essential. I'm not some gatekeeper with a million followers and reviews. I rarely have ever experienced such a thing and I was pretty surprised to be honest. They both truly believe in the product they put out and they are both on top of things when it came to addressing this situation.   The CEO mailed me a voucher to use at this location so that I could try them again and I must say that NYPD Pizza went well beyond my expectations in providing another opportunity to experience their product. I was able to sample more of the menu than before because of the generous voucher.   Now, I want to be clear that even if the experience was still lacking, I would have made mention of it in this followup, but it was indeed a 5 star experience.   What I ordered: 1x - 8 inch personal - Quattro Formaggi Pizza 1x - 16 inch medium - BBQ Chicken Pizza (ordered it crispy and yes, it came as such!) 1x - order of a 12 Garlic Cheese Knots  1x - small - Tossed Antipasto Salad  ...and all of it was great..and I'd go so far to say that I would absolutely order from them again and again. It was damn tasty. It was like I was eating from a completely different restaurant this time around and they had no idea it was me, the person wrote the negative review, coming in to place an order. I'm saying that I received the same quality as the person next to me in line did. So Angel and his team were on point. He remembered me, thanked me for allowing another chance, and he was nothing but personable, human, and concerning. I was even asked to look at the pizza before leaving which proves that again, they actually care and want to avoid mishaps. I can't praise him enough and fantastic that someone like him is there to help oversee operations of this location.  It's also great to see a CEO so involved in their company in what not only happens behind the scenes, but what happens in front of house. Good on NYPD Pizza.  Perhaps it was just a bad night for them or maybe I'm an outlier (given their 4/5 star rating), but I can honestly say I experience a 5/5 NYPD Pizza location tonight and their customer service and quick attention to the issues has given them a customer for life...or until I explode from eating to much of their pizza.   Thanks Angel, Nikki, and your Glendale team. You all nailed it and I am a satisfied customer."}
{"text":"Picked up a couple of pizzas, Greek salad, and a piece of chocolate cake.  The salad and cake were very good.  One pizza had sausage, olives, mushrooms, and basil.  They charged two bucks for fresh basil and what a joke.  They didn't put fresh basil on it but instead sprinkled dry basil from a spice jar.  Very little of it too boot.  Seriously, go to Trader Joe's and see what fresh basil looks like.  Hardly any mushrooms.  Sausage was good.  Mainly, the crust is super soggy.  The other pizza was Joey's Favorite and it also was super soggy.  The website said something about ordering pizza extra crispy.  Will do that next time but they need to just bake it a little more so it's minimally soggy.  My opinion.  Won't rush back but will give it another chance."}
{"text":"For Dad's day they offered a free meal.  So we went for dinner!  I just reviewed them three months ago, and nothing has changed.  The pizza is good.  I ordered chicken parmesan, and it was reasonably good too.  I tried a slice of leftover pizza later on, and it was good.  I still like Grimaldi's better, but it was very good.  Their pizza is definitely the star.  Their other entrees are fine, but pizza is what they do best.  And you can't beat \"free\".  It's cool that NYPD does stuff like this on Father's Day, and Veteran's Day, etc."}
{"text":"NYPD is a reliably good pizza.  They aren't the best in my opinion, but they are very good.  Nice sauce, good ingredients, and the staff is usually very good also.  On this occasion they were giving away free personal pizzas for those who signed-up for their app (plus I think you needed a code which we got from T-Mobile).  It's worth signing up to get the perks they offer from time to time.  And like I said, the pizza is very good.  Not much more to say about that!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, the person showed up with our food suffering from a really bad case of the Flu symptums.  Really bad Coughing, congested sounding, and seemed really contagious. I did not want to eat the food that we got, and I just hope we don't get sick.  Not a good customer experience."}
{"text":"The pie is really good. My favorite is the wall street...can't go wrong with bacon. Service is great, and if they get something wrong they work hard to get it right and make sure you are happy before you leave. Prices are competitive for the quality they produce...and the friendly atmosphere can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Had to stop in for some pie. If you want good tasting pie with fresh toppings and handmade fresh crust, NYPD is the place t ok go! Staff was super friendly and the place was squeaky clean. They have lots of choice of toppings and even offer military discount. Great place.   Carried out. Thdy even gave me so.e quality plates and plasicware all wrpped up in napkins. Will stop by again!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Pizza is absolutely delicious!!! Definitely recommend the garlic knots and zeppolis are addicting!!! Wednesday and Sunday's after 4pm, kids eat free!!! The staff here are so friendly!!! S/o to Tennille!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza for delivery and requested it be delivered to my work office (right up the road) by noon. This was at 10am. By 12:07 I called to check on the order. I was assured that it had already left the building and was on its way. At 12:30 I called and was told the same thing \"Oh yes, she just left. It should be there any minute.\" 12:50 and my pizza finally arrived. The woman who brought it had a piece of paper with my name on it and nothing else. She was on the phone, on hold, to find out if I had paid by card or if it was cash. I informed her that I ordered the pizza over two hours ago online and paid by card. She ignored me and we stood there for 5 minutes before she would hand over my small, now cold pizza. I signed the blank piece of paper. Now with 10 min left in my lunch break, I opened the box to find a cold and soggy pizza. The crust was wet with, I don't know what and the bottom was almost completely soggy.  This is probably the worst experience I have had. One thing after another, not to mention the website crashed on me three times when I ordered, should've know it would be a problem. Needless to say... I won't be eating here again and neither will my friends."}
{"text":"We ordered the joeys veggie pizza. The waitress suggested getting it extra crispy so it wouldn't be soggy. When the pizza arrived the dough was undercooked. The manager only offered to put our pizza back in the oven or cook a new one. We declined a new one and she offered no other compensation. The undercooked bite I did have was mediocre. There are so many great pizza places out there, I would skip NYPD."}
{"text":"Terrible service at night Aug 16. Usually the service is great.  But thanks Jersey Shore dude for ignoring us and not checking on how the piZza Was. It was raw.  And thanks for cooking it more and not bothering to making a fresh one.  And thanks for not checking if it was better the second time.  And the manager who we flagged down to fix it.  Thanks for not chomping the meal. You served raw dough pizza.   In his defense he at least got the order right.  And this place usually has great service and very good food. But thats pathetic serving raw pizza. Get it together.   I wish I refuse to pay and wish I stiffed the server. Enjoy your one star review. And guess what I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials that are inexpensive.  Liz, our server has taken great care of us there the few times in.  Very prompt service."}
{"text":"We always go on a Saturday afternoon. Not too busy and the manager is very nice and quick with everything. we ordered the garlic knots which were amazing! The bruschetta and a Mediterranean salad. We order the kids Pizza bites and ice-cream. Pizza bites are just a slice cut up into pieces. The kids loved it and the ice-cream. My salad was really good had a lot of ingredients. only thing I would recommend is to have the dressing on the side. the salad was doused in it. The kids get crayons a plate to decorate and a kids menu to color on. it keeps them occupied while we wait for our food. It does take a little longer than I would like to get everything but its still good."}
{"text":"We wandered in on a Sunday afternoon looking for a slice of pizza for lunch. We ended up with a slice of pizza, a strawberry fields salad and some great beer on tap, while sitting at the bar watching Euro soccer! Everything was SO yummy!! Service was helpful, courteous and responsive too! Also, everything was so delish that we ended up ordering cheesecake for dessert! Talk about scrumptious?!?! We will definitely go back! Fantastic place to hang!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza joints in the country. NYC pizza is fantastic but this AZ restaurant challenges it! It is consistently delicious, which can be hard to come by! Check it out!"}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place.  Very good.  Also tried the wings and I thought they were good.  Will definitely keep going back."}
{"text":"All of the Pizzas from NYPD are great. My favorite pizza of all the Pizzas at NYPD is their Sicilian Pizza"}
{"text":"Kind of a disaster. I had heard good things about this place, so my wife and I wanted to try it. Last weekend we ordered 2 small pizzas for delivery which turned out to be more than $50. This was absurdly expensive, I felt... but maybe it's just that awesome. I decided to give it a shot. Ordered the pizza at 12:30pm. The receipt said I should expect delivery by 1:22pm. Waited... waited... Finally at 1:55pm, I called the store to just cancel the order. While I was on the phone, the driver finally showed up, so I decided to go ahead and get the pizzas, since we were starving by this point. I pay the driver, including tip, and go inside. My wife's pizza was actually covered with jalapenos instead of green peppers...  So I called the store back again. I explained that I just waited an hour and a half for my delivery, and that the pizza was wrong. The lady said that she could have a new one made a sent out. No offers of additional compensation or anything like that. A little over 30 min later, the new pizza finally showed up so we ate. The pizza was pretty bland. Way overpriced, not very good, excruciatingly slow delivery time, and no additional compensation even after sending the wrong pizza. I'll stick with Rosati's. The ONE time I ever had a problem with Rosati's, they apologized profusely, fixed it, sent the correct pizza and didn't charge me ANYTHING for the entire order. That's how you do customer service. These guys couldn't seem to care less about their customers. Too bad. I always try to support the local businesses. Even Papa John's would have been better tasting at half the price."}
{"text":"My boyfriend were ravenous after a day of strolling around Phoenix (strolling is hard work, shut up). Whilst stuck in traffic heading back towards Surprise, we started getting a little hangry and snapping at each other -- but lo! Food! Pizza and pasta and beer? Please, yes! We went in and were immediately seated by a lass who looked like she hated life (black lipstick and a scowl will do that). We ordered a pizza and a pasta dish and a local beer, which was tasty. It was freeeeeezing in there, so I layered my lap in toss-away napkins and rocked back and forth like a psych ward patient.   Now...the food. The personal pizza wouldn't even have filled me up in my bird-like ways, much less my garbage disposal of a boyfriend. He was finished with it in about 3 bites. It was pretty light on the toppings, as well, and it arrived on the table uncut. Charming. My pasta dish was boring. Think of the most Spaghetti-O-plain-Jane-no-herbs marinara sauce you can conjure up. Now make it blander. That was my pasta. Tolerable, but not worth the price. I let my still-starving man eat the rest.  So he ordered a cannoli, thinking, Yay, two for $5, that's awesome! Um...these things were the size of a 5-year-old's pinky. I didn't even know they came that small. I've worked in 2 Italian restaurants (both family-owned and admittedly superior to any chain out there), so I know what a good cannoli can look like. That wasn't it.   Service stunk. Didn't bring out utensils with the dessert, never checked in, didn't bring the waters we asked for twice, brought the bill before we were even done with entrees. All in all, I can see why the only other patrons were old folks.  Gets 2 stars for not being stinky, dirty, etc. But not coming back."}
{"text":"A little taste of home. Best pizza we have found in the valley and great deals for kids. Our service left a little to be desired but hey it's a pizza place and we will be back"}
{"text":"Pretty good chain pizza.  Service was good too once I got the waitresses attention.  I must say that there is nothing special about this particular restaurant/location.  I had a small side salad with vinagrette dressing.  Very tasty.  Followed by the \"Meateaters\" pizza for one (10\").  The pizza was really just average.  Nothing to write home about.  And they're not cheap by any means."}
{"text":"Not the restaurant for me!!!!  Management doesn't seem to be willing to discuss as much as they are willing to confront, well one employee in particular.  Sad.  I guess this is the way that  current businesses expect to succeed these days.  Maybe that is why so many go out of business."}
{"text":"If you're craving some good, hearty, NY pizza, NYPD is the place to go. I say hearty because it's a bit thicker than the typical NY pizza with a thicker layer of toppings but it's not as thick as a normal pizza either. It was perfect for me.   We got \"Da Works\", which is basically a combo pizza but it's very rich in flavor with fresh ingredients. We also got the \"Kahuna\", which is their Hawaiian and that was amazing as well. Don't forget to order some Garlic bread and wings as well as beer and wine!   The atmosphere is very chill and New York like. Service was excellent and I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow, what an improvement. I'm not sure what has happened at this location, but keep it up. It feels like the way it was before all the mess ups. Delivery was 30 before the quoted time and everything was hot and fresh. This is a much better improvement from out last three experiences. Maybe NYPD has reclaimed a very loyal customer."}
{"text":"Had the Sicilian BBQ Chicken with pineapple:) It was delicious, it only feeds two though. Kind of pricey but tasty."}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice and I'm a fan.  Highly recommend the Wall Street pizza and garlic knots; the thin crust is deliciously combined with pepperoni, sausage, bacon, and mushrooms.  If you want to broaden your selection you won't be disappointed by the chopped antipasto or chicken wings either.  They're not on the same level as the pizza and garlic knots but good nevertheless.  Can't say enough good things about that pizza; now that I'm back in California, I'm craving a slice."}
{"text":"Best pizza on the planet! By far !!! So amazing and delicious. Cannot get enough. Wait staff iffy, sometimes good... Sometimes not so much.  Update~ This particular place has now gone out of business. So sad. Not sure since the food was so amaze, but maybe the waitstaff did them in."}
{"text":"I usually get the pizza at the Central/McDowell area when at work and this is the only one close to my home.  Went on the weekend with the family, it was not that busy it was pretty nice atmosphere inside.  Seated pretty quickly, the service to get our drinks at first was a little slow but afterwards the waitress was attentive. The menu is pretty pricey, one large pizza sets you back to 20 bucks. We got the garlic knots, the large pepperoni and sausage pizza with side of harvest salad.  It was so good. Loved the sliced sausage on my pizza, never had that style before. The salad was great. I would recommend going and giving it a try. I wish they opened one in the Mesa area."}
{"text":"Ordered a calzone which was really good. Takes about 20-30 min even if you're the only one there because that is baking time so don't be in a hurry.  Kind of expensive for pizza but, whatever, it's something different than the usual. Servers are nice."}
{"text":"You get overly pricey New York prices and slow New York service.   Want affordable yummy food? Fageetaboutbit."}
{"text":"Pizza was good! Wait time was too long and we placed our order over the phone 15 minutes before. It was the lunch hour."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a group of people.  No one could decide on a pie or pies so we all got slices. I got a very generic slice of pepperoni and 6 wings.  The pizza was good and the wings were good but the wait was not. Nypd shall now be know as \"The home of the half hour slice.\""}
{"text":"Good solid NY style pizza.  Ordered over the phone for pickup, basic large cheese. Arrived 25 mins later, was greeted at the door and checked out immediately $15 and some change, pizza was ready and piping hot.  Pizza tasted very good, authentic to NY taste, awesome NY crust, stretchy gooey yummy cheese, no complaints everyone loved it."}
{"text":"The service was good, the waitress was friendly n didn't over bother us but the food was ABC 123 it was plain as can be to me sadly...... So I'll try again cus my partner claims it's native New Yorker...... Even though I would beg to differ"}
{"text":"We are traveling thru Surprise on our way to Vegas and stumbled upon this AWESOME pizza place.  Our server Sierra was the sweetest and most genuine young lady!  We ordered garlic knots which came out quickly and were very tasty.  At first I wasn't sure about the sesame seeds but after bite two I was a fan.  Beer was cold. Wine was great.  And the pizza.... ohhhhh the pizza.  The crust was an excellent combination of a chew yet airy crust and thin but not too thin perfection.  The sauce was tangy but not overpowering. And that cheese.  It wa pizza commercial pretty the way it got all stringy from the pan to my plate.  The tomatos were fresh and pepperoni were perfect.  And here's a secret  tip from one yelper to another....  Pokemon Go eat pizza at NYPD Pizza!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly people.  Had to wait for awhile for our to go pizza. They let us have a drink of soda or tea.  That was nice.  I ended up going shopping in the little area there.  Got the pizza and salad home and honestly I was under whelmed but the pizza and salad.  It was kinda limpy but it had a nice flavor.  Next day I had a slice of cold pizza and it was soggy.    My son liked it and it was bought for him really."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try, since we drive by it all the time.  First time we came we ordered the meat lovers. It came out fresh and hot and was pretty good. We had added garlic for the extra kick.  The salad we okay, not really worth getting.    The second time we sat at the bar and ordered the Big Kahuna.  It has ham, pineapple and basil.  I had added garlic to it as well. I enjoyed this pie more than the first. I also had a beer that I guess was from New York.  Anyway the beer and pizza combo was wonderful.. Our server/bartender was friendly and efficient.  Overall, I thought it was a decent enough place."}
{"text":"First time visit to the restaurant and first time trying their pizza. So glad we did and our server, Danielle, was great. We started with a couple of cannolis and then had a small pie with sausage, mushrooms, roasted red peppers, onions and fresh garlic. Thanks for the awesome meal and we'll see you again soon. We highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great options here, carry out, delivery or sit in.  We started off with garlic knots, yum!  The wings are good as well, nothing too hot for the sauce but still good.  Their blue cheese is better than the ranch.  Great options on the pizza toppings.  I would get margarita, pesto or the vegginizza.  Gluten free crust is so tasty! Liz was great and provided amazing service among great recommendations!"}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent.  Atmosphere was really nice.  Service was great.  Only complaint i have is they don't have fresh cracked pepper for salads or pasta.  I think that's a miss."}
{"text":"We love this Place. We had the Ceasar Salad and Spaghetti and Meatballs and it was delicious and perfect portion.  Pricing is excellent! The service was Superior and the Manager Sergio was so great to talk to. We are looking to do a fundraiser nights for AAHC and he provided us with all of the information we needed. We are looking forward to returning next weekend!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food and service here is always outstanding and second to none.  Just wanted to recognize our helpful and friendly server from last night, Elliot.  Elliot was spot on and had a great demeanor!  Thanks for always making our visit here a great one.  The My Za BBQ chicken is the bomb!"}
{"text":"5 STARS based on my overall experience!!!!!!!!!!! Nothing has changed with the food, it still is and always has been a solid 4 1/2 to a 5. I have never had a bad pizza at any of the NYPD Pizza's I have been to. One of the things that put this over the top was the large antipasto  salad that we started with. There was plenty of salami, cheese, and ham which at other places is skimped on. The salami and cheese was nice and thick, NOT some cheap thin cut garbage.  We went on Wednesday night for a family dinner and took our 3 kids. A good tip, which we learned last night, is Wednesdays kids eat free! Not a little meal but a good size meal. Drink, meal, and desert. My 4 year old got the spaghetti and it was more then enough for him, and my 3 year old got the pizza bites. The pizza bites are not some frozen, bread covered, get it anywhere stuff. It is full piece of pizza cut for a kid. We didn't even order a meal fro our 1 year old because there was more then enough food for her to pick off of.  The last thing that needs to be mentioned was our server Tyler. He is the biggest reason that this was a 5 star experience. He was polite and on top of everything! Since it was late our kids were acting up and getting loud, which I know can be annoying for a server and other costumers, but he did not start rushing us.   I don't like to write long reviews because honestly most people don't read the whole thing and most of the time there is not that much to say, but this time everything was worth a top rating.  WELL DONE NYPD PIZZA!"}
{"text":"My gal pals and I usually get together a few times a year to celebrate our birthdays.  This is our go-to place as it is centrally located between our homes.  We are always pleased with this location but our visit on 9/1/15 was truly the BEST.  Our server Michelle was amazing!  Super enthusiastic and provided excellent service.  She acknowledged it was a b-day celebration and said happy birthday to the birthday girl numerous times throughout our visit.  She made sure we knew about the complimentary dessert and of course we took advantage of that.  :-) I would have to say this is not the cheapest pizza in town but it is REALLY GREAT tasting and they have a great happy hour.  I highly recommend the Strawberry Fields salad.  Delicious!!   Side note to management..... our group (all ladies) did stop going to your restaurant for a brief time due to the homeless/disadvantaged people approaching us and begging for money every time we were in the parking lot.  It appears this unfortunate situation has been rectified as we saw security patrolling the lot and not a single person approached us for $$."}
{"text":"Have ordered carry out at this location a few times and orders have been on time both times. Pizza is really good. Ranch is on point. Wings are usually really crispy at the restaurant but when you get them for carry out they usually don't stay crispy. Customer service is always very friendly. In my opinion, I think it's a little pricey but that doesn't stop me from going."}
{"text":"First of all,let me say that I used to love this place. Last night we did take-out. Spaghetti with Marinara,Cheese Pizza,and Garlic Knots.  It seems that take-out is not nearly as good as eat-in. The spaghetti was just fair,the pizza,meh,and the garlic knots that I used to crave,had little flavor. Not happy with NYPD at all."}
{"text":"Great quality pizza: perfect crust, fresh ingredients. Has online delivery, which is hard to find and super convenient. The fried zucchini is perfect."}
{"text":"Always a great stop! good pizza and great service in a Nice atmosphere, plus kids eat free night made it easy on the pocket thanks NYPD pizza"}
{"text":"First time everrrrrr that I wish yelp had a half star. The pizza is great. The wings are good. The service is awful. That combination = 3.5 stars.  I was in the area and wanted to try more places that served wings after my awesome luck at Long Wong's. NYPD has an \"express lunch\" area which has a different menu than the normal dine-in menu. I went with a sicilian slice (already cooked and on display) and 6 wings. There was only one other table (2 people) in the lobby, so I figured I'd get my food within a reasonable amount of time.    I waited over 30 minutes to get that very simple dish... and it came with one celery stick. I asked for more celery, so the waitress brought out two celery sticks... really?  I would eat here again, but only through delivery."}
{"text":"Great pizza !!!! Probably the best I've had in Scottsdale . The crust is cooked to perfection and all the toppings are great too !! A good and more casual environment for pizza in the Scottsdale area . :)"}
{"text":"NYPD has a good bar, with good beer, Sunbru. The wings are good and the pizza is nice. Ask for it cooked crispy."}
{"text":"Oh yes, I did want to thank the staff and management at the NYPD Pizza in Avondale.  They Rock!  They contacted me to see if they could make up for the issue with my pizza and invited me back in and made everything right with no problem's whatsoever these guys are true Pizza pro's and know how to treat customer's I would go back again and again..... Thanks once again guys.  Sorry about the major delay had some IT issues....  Derrick M."}
{"text":"Very well done pizza...its like a pizza pillow, tasty, savory and rather doughy.  This is not my favorite style of pizza but nonetheless it was especially good pizza.  The service staff was top notch and the store is very warm and inviting.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Cool place! The staff was very nice although the food was pretty average. Yummy pizza crust though. We got a margarita pizza (pretty decent) and some fried mozzarella (would not recommend). To sum it all up, this restaurant has a cool vibe, friendly service, but the meal was just okay."}
{"text":"Now I haven't been to this place in a while, but I sure remember it, and it was good. As a child, I went to NYPD's Wednesday kids eat free/discount program.  PRO- When I walked in, it actually looked like a pizzeria. I liked the bowl of mints they kept for people who ate a ton of garlic knots. So, when I entered, the hostess seated me. The Waitress took my order, I remember that I ordered Hell's Kitchen wings, Knots, and a Pepperoni Pizza. My knots arrived first, they had garlic butter and marinara, both were superb. My wings then came, and let me tell you something, I am immune to most spicy things. But those wings man, I loved them. They were spicy, but not too spicy for me, They even added neat little jalepenoes as decoration. My pizza came, and I liked the garlic salt, and oregano sets they had. The pizza was excellent.  Cons- The price literally took me to Hell's kitchen. The waitress took long to bring me my food. I don't like the fact of a bar, right next to a kids' restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't get their \"hero\"s /their hot subway sandwiches. Last night I ordered to go bruschetta, spaghetti & meatballs, a chicken parmigiana hero and an eggplant parmigiana hero. The bruschetta was delicious and perfect, the spaghetti was good and came with two extra large meatballs and three rolls, but the hero sandwiches were pretty gross. My husband and I could barely stomach them: not only was the bread tough and hard to bite through, but both sandwiches were dry and had hardly any sauce on them. Chicken and eggplant parm dishes traditionally also have sauce on them, so we expected sauce on our sandwiches. There was a small bit on the top but the bread was completely dry and it left both sandwiches tasting bland and gross. I could only handle one bite last night when we ordered before I had to put it down; today I tried to finish it for lunch, and I did, but I shouldn't have, because it came back up in the toilet 5 minutes later. It was that gross.  I'm sure their pizzas are great - I saw pizzas being served to tables when I was picking up my order and they looked delicious. But man those sandwiches were disappointing and unappetizing."}
{"text":"We usually do takeout and every time I go in I am greeted by several employees.   They are always attentive and friendly. It's hard to find anywhere these days that offers great customer service so kudos to the staff!  The tossed antipasto salad and lasagna are delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! I came to visit Tempe about 6 months ago and had NYPD pizza and couldn't wait to come back for ASU orientation to have it again. Great taste and all for a great price."}
{"text":"This is one of my top two favorite traditional pizza places in Valley. I am partial to ricotta and salami or ricotta and breaded eggplant for toppings. The crust is thin enough to fold but thick enough to have some chew to it.   And, whatever you do: start with the spinach artichoke dip! (It really could/should be a meal in itself but is sure to at least become a standard kick off for your table.)"}
{"text":"Very tasty pizza- sweet sauce but wouldn't call NY style as not that thin. Setting had adequate beers on tap and nice TV's for watching game."}
{"text":"Their pizza is the best I've tasted.  Their prices are slightly high, but it's worth it the pizza and pasta is so good.  Make sure to save room for the zeppolies (sp).... They are to die for.  My favorite is the raspberry sauce."}
{"text":"Our first experience here was not stellar by any means. We waited over 30 minutes for salad and drinks to come out, and then waited again for pizza.   I only came back because this place is the closest place to eat after a medical procedure. It was more necessity than anything else. Buuuuut...   This time it was a lot better! They remembered us and got our salads out super fast. The waiter remembered that I am vegan and got me everything I needed to be able to have an awesome pizza experience.   I didn't even leave a rating last time because I would've been too upset. Haha. I was starving and waiting to eat sucked.   This time was AMAZING and saved this review. I'll be back for sure. Stellar experience. Also a shoutout to the manager who obviously put our constructive feedback into place between two visits, two weeks apart. So good!"}
{"text":"Not a well known location so its not as busy as some NYPDs I've been to. Just as good as the others though. Probably the fastest I've ever gotten my Calzone. I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"I really  like NYPD food and service. Don't sit on the patio though, they forget about you out there. I was disgusted and left from the lack of service out there. I did eventually come back because I like their food."}
{"text":"So my husband and I went looking for some place \"new to eat\". I wasn't in the mood for pizza but we went in anyway. Boy was I happy we did ! We had the Big Kahuna and it was fantastic! The crust was excellent, so good I ate the ends! I never do, but the entire pizza was terrific. The service was excellent, our waiter checked on us and we never ran out of drinks. The manager also came to make sure we were doing alright. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is a fun, family restaurant.  The pizza is perfectly good but not memorable or outstanding.  It's great for kids and the atmosphere is fun.  It's a solid American version of pizza.  This cannot be compared to truly excellent pizza like what you find at Pomo or Andreolis Italian Grocer on Wednesday and Saturday evenings."}
{"text":"Being the pizza snob that I am, I have tried many places that said they had NY style pizza. There's only been two others that came close. Met a friend here last night and I have to say, it gets not much better than this! Our food was on point and the beer was cold, the service was what puts it over the top. I've never had poor service at ANY NYPD location but our server, Steve, well he's just the toppings on the pie!  Polite, friendly and knowledgeable makes a return trip in the near future (sitting in Steve's section) a guarantee!"}
{"text":"My co-worker and I decided to pick-up lunch today at the NYPD on McDowell & 7th Ave.  There were a few people behind the counter and in the kitchen.  Was not busy at all.  The Manager even took my order on a spare register while my co-worker was getting her order rung up.  And then, we waited.. and waited... and waited.  We both ordered the \"express\" lunch deal w/ one slice of pizza and a salad.  The salads were bagged and put on the wait line, but our ONE SLICE of pizza's took FOREVER.  I think we sat there for 30 minutes.  You could see people in the kitchen hanging out, as well as the front.  So, I don't know why it took soooo long to WARM-UP our slices and put them in a box.  I finally went to the cash register and talked to the woman in suspenders and inquired about our EXPRESS LUNCHes...  She said it was coming up and rolled her eyes after I walked away (per my co-worker).  The Manager wasn't around to talk to.  We finally got our orders and left.  When we got back to work, the pizza slices were small & lukewarm;  and the salads were room temperature by now.  WE will not be going back to this location again."}
{"text":"No sauce on the thin.  Wrong toppings on the Sicilia.  Honestly we only ate half: ( will not order again.  Oh yes an hour wait and 40 buck for serving size of 5-6.  To bad high hopes!"}
{"text":"This review is for the delivery service only!  I've ordered from here a couple of times. While I think the food is a bit on the pricey side of things, (most of) the stuff here tastes pretty scrumptious.  I highly recommend the white pie, garlic knot appetizers, and the Caesar salad. (But for the last one, there are very few places that mess up a Caesar salad...) I think the chicken parmigiana sandwiches are pretty good here, but my friend disagreed, so... good-not-great. And taking the prize in the Yuck! category are the calzones - they are super greasy and have no saving quality. The only dessert that really holds up under delivery conditions is probably the New York style cheesecake - ask for all three sauces."}
{"text":"First time to Phoenix and my best friend who lives here highly recommended this spot for good NY pizza.  I trust that she would know as she is also from NY and New Yorkers are funny about their pizza.  Well I have to say it was well worth it.  Very seldom do I eat pizza when I leave NY, but this was really good and the service was good as well.  Te only reason I did not give 5 *'s is that i was not a fan of the salad.  This is a definite must if your in the mood for good pizza."}
{"text":"Aside from the yummy food... I have to acknowledge the ABOVE & BEYOND service we received outside of the restaurant. Our car wouldn't start, we had been waiting for a tow truck to jump start the car. My husband went in to ask for water which they gave without question... the manager found out we needed to jump start. She had one of her employees help her out to help us out. We had our two lil ones with us and living in AZ during noon is not the funnest place to be stranded. They both were able to help us out and jump start our car. The employee even checked our car out to make sure it wasn't anything else. I'm truly grateful for kind people who are willing to put themselves in uncomfortable situations dealing with 100 degree weather to help strangers out! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the manager is super nice and attentive, but I've been here twice now and I have yet to receive good service. The place isn't busy and I haven't seen the waiter check in on many of the other tables. I have seen the manager more times than our waiter. I needed more water and it got to the point where I just got up to refill it myself. I took all that for the waiter to notice and stopped me and asked if I wanted a refill. When our waiter does come around it takes him about 10 minutes to actually come back with what we needed."}
{"text":"The service at NYPD has gone down hill. I went to this location with my friend and everything seem to take forever. The waitress didn't know the menu at all. When I would ask a question she would either make me wait 10 minutes for an answer or take my menu and look. Shouldn't you know this stuff off the top of your head? My friend works in the resturant industry and was very unhappy with our experience. On top of it all, when our water glasses were empty they would sit there for a good 20 mins before they got refilled. I used to go to the Union Hills location and I loved it. But this reopening at this location...I doubt I'll be back. Take your money else where people!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is very good!  Patio is nice and well shaded.  They will allow pets on the patio if well behaved!"}
{"text":"I am a very frequent customer of NYPD. I absolutely love their food and the quality is usually exceptional. The past fews times I have ordered food for delivery it has been awful. The first time I brushed it off as a bad night but now after several times I am truly beyond disappointed. They have sent me cold pizza, forgot items and even when I specifically mentioned/reminded them.... they still failed to bring it. The food is more expensive than most pizza joints, which makes sense because of their quality.... but after so many mistakes how can you continue to keep paying for bad service (especially for loyal customers)?"}
{"text":"this pizza place is definitely one of the better places i've found in Arizona there pizza reminds me of the pizza in New Jersey/New York area definitely would recommend to others"}
{"text":"Dined here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and it was okay.  Ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza that lacked flavor, a side Caesar salad that required more dressing and was quite expensive for the small size it was.  Best part of my lunch was the croutons, that tasted homemade.  We also order a side of mac and cheese with jalapenos and that was rather tasty. Service was good and manager was pleasant when I requested more dressing. Not sure I will seek them out again."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place ever! The staff is friendly and prompt. The pizza is top notch.  Great atmosphere and even better food."}
{"text":"I'm still on the hunt for the best pizza and wings in the area and NYPD is number one so far.  I usually get take out or delivery and they are always efficient and prompt.  Of the times I've been inside, I've seen the manager running around lending an extra hand wherever needed.  It was a nice change from the usual managers that just casually walk by and ask how your meal was."}
{"text":"Well this review is after our experience with our take home pizza last night. Let me start there first. We love New York style pizza. In this part of Chandler there is nothing beside NYPD, that we know of, that is New York style. Our favorite pizza is Venezia's but it is not near where we live, so we have to go with something different. That is why we have gone with NYPD. I have had pizza from this location and company several times, it is great! However..... last night was far from a shining moment. Now when there are only a few ingredients on your pizza and the main ingredient is cheese, you expect cheese to cover the pizza, not even close with this pizza last night. My husband got home with the half cheese, half pepperoni pizza and it was shocking how much cheese was NOT on this pizza! I mean so much so that before I even started eating it, I called NYPD to inform a manager of this issue.  I spoke to two different people before getting a manager, however the manager did listen to the issue and said she apologized for it. She said something about they have recently made changes to the portions on their pies, I took that as \"we recently started putting less cheese and toppings and the cooks are not use to it yet\"... anyway... the manager said she would send me a discount card for another visit, though she did offer to remake the pizza for us right than, but there was no way we were going to wait and go back out again to pick it up. I will say that I don't know if I will return to NYPD for pizza again. We may just go a few miles out of our way to get Venezia's,which we have never had any issues being gypped of cheese or toppings on our pizza. We also got garlic cheese knots and those too were lacking cheese on every knot and not very much garlic, or butter for that matter.. they were very dry and a waste of our money.  NYPD... I hope you are reading this.. You are over priced on a good day! You should never, ever skimp on a main ingredient.. ever! People order pizza because they love cheese, to gyp a consumer of that is robbery. I understand everyone has a bad day, and maybe we got you on one of those but please give your customers what they are paying for every time all the time, that is just good business ethics."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 5 stars but as a disclaimer I've only had their pizza. My fiancee and I have gotten pizza from this location a couple of times and every time it's hot and Delicious. This location is very convenient for pickup or they have a patio if you're feeling social. We usually get the Vinny's favorite where you can choose up to 5 different toppings. We get a new combination of toppings each time and are never disappointed. I would highly recommend trying ricotta cheese and eggplant on your pizza. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"To whom it may concern: I've visited this excellent restaurant many times with my husband and family and until today have always considered the experience amazing in every regard!  Today I was disappointed.  I came in alone and sat at the bar as I was going shopping at Fry's next door and just wanted a quick bite.  I ordered a slice and 6 wings.  The food was excellent as always, and the service was near perfect except for one huge faux pa... As I ate, I was transfixed by an episode of Bones.  I hardly took my eyes of the screen.  I had forgotten my cell phone at home, and as I was dining alone watching the TV enhanced my dining experience.  I was the only person sitting at the bar for some time, and was about 75% done with my meal when an older guy came and also sat at the bar.  Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed him glance over at me a few times as I watched the Bones episode.  Soon after that our server, Fabienne came back, and this man whispered something to her.  To my utter amazement Fabienne said something to the effect of, \"Oh sure Sir, I can do that!\" She proceeded to change the channel to a sports game without even glancing over at me to ask if I was done watching, or if I minded.  If she would have asked I would have given my \"ok,\" but I was offended that she didn't even acknowledge me.  I was stunned!  I bill was $10.52, and I normally would have left a $3 tip on this small amount, because I respect and value the hard work servers do, but this time I left a $2 tip.  I didn't say anything to her as I felt she knew exactly what she had done, and didn't care, because she held the man in higher regard than me a lone female.  I know there's a misconception out there that single women don't tip that well, but her mistake is in assuming, and holding another person in higher regard due to gender, ethnicity, or I don't know what.  She should have considered the fact that I do come in with my husband, and/or family 90% of the time, and we always treat our servers like they are our own kids, and tip well.  A little disappointed today..."}
{"text":"I like NYPD. It is good.   We had a pizza with 5 toppings.   1. pep 2. garlic....yeah 3. onion, red 4. green peppers 5. roma tomato  It was a great combo except the tomato was not very tasty. The garlic was killer. In a good way.   The kids had pasta with meatballs and garlic knots.   YUMMY!"}
{"text":"The food is good but they have raised prices much like everyone else but it's getting to a point where the value isn't their any longer. They get packed and service can be spotty. They do deliver as well but for some reason the pizza always comes cooler than we'd like it. The wings are great be sure to ask for extra sauce though they can be pretty dry as they seem to skimp on the sauce."}
{"text":"WOW!!  Great pizza!  Try the \"Soho Salad\" (yummy fresh salad on a thin crunchy pizza crust) or the \"Prosciutto Perfecto\".  Fantastic!  And the service is awesome!"}
{"text":"Before I knew it was a local chain, NYPD Pizza served as an oasis of semi-authenticity amid a sea of Brea, California-like national-chain-store hell.  My parents and I were frantically driving home from a bloodbath of a college football game, but we weren't going to roll the dice and wait till Blythe, California, and settle for its pathetic Denny's.  No, my intrepid readers, I got off the freeway at North Dysart Road--and there was South Bend, Indiana-inspired authenticity to that random choice, though it's difficult and possibly in poor taste for me to explain the reference--and searched amid the strip malls for something, anything that wasn't an Applebee's or a P.F. Chang or a Mimi's Cafe.  There was NYPD Pizza.  Technically, it's just NYPD, since it stands for New York Pizza Department.  But I'll forgive them the redundancy and almost the blind, tacit approval of police brutality because this restaurant knows what it's doing.  The food is delicious, although I didn't have any pizza.  It comes in large portions, and there's quite a variety for a random Arizona pizza chain.  The service really stands out as well.  I believe four people helped us, and each one was very friendly and efficient.  If someone had to pass along a task to someone else, he or she let us know what was going on.  Even though the restaurant was busy on a Saturday night and we were sitting in a prime booth, we never felt rushed, yet we received our bill right after we turned down dessert.  No fussing or ignoring us just because we weren't going to order anything else; my dad's coffee got refilled, and we were on our way.  The New York theme is done well, and it's actually subtle, which is quite an accomplishment in a restaurant this large.  The bathrooms are clean, and there's tons of parking.  It reminded me of Welcome Back, Kotter, even though no one was yelling \"Ooh! ooh!\" and there wasn't a closet with the word \"CLOSET\" painted on the wall right above it in a horrid shade of brown."}
{"text":"I have fallen in love with this place pizzas an calzones. I'm 15 weeks pregnant an this place covered all my cravings last night. There dough is OUTSTANDING, getting thin crusts on occasion is great too, their cheese cake is addicting  with 3 different choices of toppings to chose from. I will always order from this establishment, great service an great choices."}
{"text":"No place settings - had to steal from empty table.  Dough wasn't cooked all the way, cold and doughy in spots with hot toppings? Frozen pizza kinda quality. Salads were drenched in dressing to the point of soggy lettuce."}
{"text":"I love this Pizza place!!!!!I had the white pizza and it is amazing!!!The only set back is its kinda pricey compared to other pizza joints but it is worth it for the quality of the pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza. I took them up on their water challenge and did notice a difference. Regardless of whether the water makes their pizzas taste good or it's something else, is irrelevant when you enjoy their delicious pizza. Wall Street is one of their best."}
{"text":"I tried the Pizza Blanca with Roma tomatoes and it was, literally, the best pizza I've ever tasted! The garlic knots are also very tasty. I was impressed with the management when our pizza was delayed for over an hour. The manager came out and said our whole meal was paid for. This is the type of service I would expect, but do not receive from many restaurants. Kids eat free on Wednesdays, which I know is a big plus. My overall experience was great, despite the sometimes inconsistent waiters/waitresses."}
{"text":"Best Gluten-Free crust!  I've been trying to find a good gluten-free pizza and I finally found it. However, I had my pizza baked in their regular oven at my waiter Austin's suggestion even though they have a separate gluten-free oven.  The crust was nice and chewy unlike most places where it's hard.  Happy camper!"}
{"text":"I've only ordered delivery from this restaurant so maybe the restaurant dining experience is better. The first time the food was pretty decent. Upstate wings were spicy and saucy and the lasagna was ok. Ever since that first experience it's been consistently downhill. I ordered the calzone the second time. It tasted like someone spread Philly cream cheese inside of pizza dough (YUCK). Hero sandwich was tasteless, lasagna the second time around was bland and the wings were dry and without flavor as well.  Plus everything was cold upon arrival. The cold arrival became a trend for them as I haven't received a hot meal any of the other three times I ordered.  I wanted to give these guys another chance to redeem themselves tonight so I ordered the Upstate Wings, Fried Calamari and a Greek Salad. The salad was the only decent thing and since it was supposed to be cold I didn't mind it being that way. Calamari was soggy and had too much breading and the wings were again cold and dry.  Skip this place for delivery. Maybe the in-house experience is better."}
{"text":"So I'm updating my review. After the bad experience we had, we received a phone call from the manager and they offered us a gift certificate to give them another chance. I also received a message here on Yelp apologizing for how our experience went. On top of that they hand delivered the gift certificate.  With all of that we tried again today using the gift certificate. I got individual pizzas for all of my staff and an order of Zucchini. All of our food was hot and actually really good.Later in the afternoon we even got a phone call to make sure our order was okay.  After all of this I've got to give them credit for really stepping up after our previous experience. It really shows that they care about not only their reputation, but their quality."}
{"text":"I tried a few different kinds of pizza and they were all okay.  A few people had told me that they made \"incredible\" pizzas, but I didn't really think so...I'd say they were pretty good pizzas.  What I liked were the fresh tasting vegetables which topped some of the pizzas.  The cheese was a bit disappointing, especially since I don't think you can really go wrong with cheese...it just lacked flavor.  All in all, I probably wouldn't go back...it just really wasn't all that impressive."}
{"text":"I eat here probably once a week for lunch and I must say, It's one of my top favorite pizza joints. Lunch here is a breeze. There is usually no wait at peek lunch hours and to boot they have an express lunch line that gives you the option to order by the slice from an assortment of pre-made pizzas. Ok. I know I know. Pre-made??? Let me tell you, they heat that shit right up in their oven and its perfect! I usually pig out here and get three slices, either the plain cheese (so simple and so good), the pepperoni/jalapeno or the tomato ricotta white pizza. Oh yeah, the sicilian style pizza is awesome, but that one you have get made fresh to order. Way better that way. You can really taste the NYC water in the dough with that one! If you enjoy a good Greek Salad this place has one of the best. The dressing is so damn good.  I have tried on occasion to stray from the pizza and have always been disappointed. NYPD is excellent for pizza, I suggest sticking with that when you go."}
{"text":"Nice space and friendly staff, parking is shared with Fry's and the other shops in this L shaped part of the strip mall. I stopped in to get my free birthday pizza to-go and I realized that I should've called my order in, because they were pretty busy. The manager was super sweet and gave me a free soda on the house floor enjoy while I waited so I was happy to wait and type out this review. This place is great for linking up with friends and family after work or just because you want some pizza, pasta or a delicious Italian inspired dessert. As a bonus they have vegan cheese so you can get a vegan pizza called the \"Veganizza\"."}
{"text":"Got to admit I was not thinking I would really enjoy our dinner at NYPD Pizza. No reason why, just thought it had a chain restaurant vibe and I would be disappointed. I am glad to say that I was wrong and it was a very enjoyable meal with the family.   For dinner we started with the crispy fresh mozzarella. The dish was panko covered mozzarella with your typical marinara sauce but also with a side of balsamic reduction that was a hit. As for our entrée, we went with their large pizza that was half big kahuna (ham, pineapple, and basil) and half ricotta and meatball. The kahuna was decent and the ricotta half was awesome. The ricotta and meatball together were so flavorful. As good as they were the real winner was N.Y.'s crust. That stuff was so good. Just the right amount of crisp and chewiness. I guess their filtered water really is the difference.   Staff was great and the ambience was nice with slightly dimmed lighting. Just the way this guy likes it. Overall, a very nice dining experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"I am vegan and my ENTIRE family is not.  I was blown away when i found out last week that they have a VEGAN pizza!  I am always up to trying mainstream restaurants with a healthy dish for us non-carnivores.  I ordered a 10 inch Veganizza and added red onion. My husband and father-in-law ordered a medium 1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 red onion.  Each person was completely happy with the pizza.  My pizza was delicious.  They used Daiya cheese, basil, spinach, garlic and red onion.  I will for sure get it again.  It's so close and so delicious.    I wondered why they even made a vegan pizza and it turns out that the owner's son is vegan.  Who knew!  This pizza was created for him.  LOVE IT!!! Nice job, NYPD!  Nice Job!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great lunch specials! I have never been disappointed in the pizza here!    Tons of toppings on my fave...Joey's favorite (minus the onions). Their antipasto is to die for with tons of flavor and endless goodness!   My boyfriend loved the pizza and the wings!"}
{"text":"35 minutes. That's how long my four-year-old son and I waited from the time we sat down until we received our lunch. Granted, my son is more patient than most children his age, but after about 20 minutes, he started to ask about where his food was. This occurred on Good Friday between 1:30 and 2:30 pm.  I guess I should have been alerted to this situation from the moment I walked in. No one greeted us, and it took about three minutes before we were even acknowledged. We wanted to sit outside, but after 60 seconds of debating with a colleague, the gentleman told us there were no outside seats - although we clearly saw two empty tables. Then, the shirts on the employees said, \"Unique like a Brooklyn accent.\" I really should question a company that doesn't use proper grammar. (It should read, \"Unique, like a Brooklyn accent.\")  The person who seated us also took our order moments after we sat down. I asked for apple juice for my son and was told they were out, so we switched to iced tea for him and water with lemon for me. We shortly received our drinks - sans lemon.   After we were there about 10 minutes, a large party of 10 was seated near us. Half were small children my son's age and they received lemons with their beverages, so my thought that the restaurant was perhaps out of those too was erased. Unfortunately, our waiter never checked on us, and I actually had to flag him down as my son was whining for food to get a water refill and ask - again - for a lemon. It was then that he told me he'd check on our food.  FINALLY, 35 minutes in, our food arrived. I think we were so hungry at that point that dirt would have sufficed. My son doesn't usually like mac and cheese that is penne with cheese sauce, but he ate nearly all of it. My eggplant lasagna was certainly not the best I've had. Neither of our items was baked, so I'm still not sure what the holdup was. And, by the way, the table of 10 received their food before we did and came and left in the hour we were there. While I'm complaining, my son's ice cream was so frozen I almost needed a knife to cut it for him.  I would like to say the poor service was because the restaurant was understaffed. Although the place was full, I counted seven employees, including a manager. Other tables were receiving much better service, so I'd have to say the problem was more with our server (who never shared his name). My son and I eat out about once a week, and I always leave 20% for a tip, but this time I left $1 on a $16 bill. At first, I felt badly about it, but then I remembered, \"Oh yeah, it's not like I'm ever coming back here.\"  *** On 4/5/10, Alana, a representative from NYPD Pizza sent me an e-mail when she came across my review and offered her sincere apologies, a follow-up call from customer service, and a coupon for a free pizza / meal. I was very appreciative of the response, and as I told her, I've been to other NYPD Pizza locations with much better results; I think this episode was the result of a new or poorly trained server."}
{"text":"Ate here today with a friend. they have all their booths occupied, so we were sat at the half booth and chair. Skinny blond server with green eyeliner served us. She was okay. Checked on us a tad bit too much, but Id rather have that than completely ignoring us. She mixed up my order though. I wanted the eggplant parmigiano but she gave me the chicken parmigiano. She quickly apologized anyway and had my right order packed To Go while i ate the mistake one. Both were good. They were meh. Not exemplary. My friend had their lasagna and she didn't finish everything, she said it was just okay too. Anyway, I'm willing to go back and try one more time. But I don't think I'll be coming back anytime sooner."}
{"text":"Good solid pizza joint. We frequent the NYPD Pizza in Orlando. The food was similar. We had garlic knots...good but for our preference could have used more garlic and butter. Boneless wings and pizza...da works minus olives, both were good. We had hoped to try the NYPD Amber Ale but they were out....what?!?"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places I have been to in a long time and this is coming from a transplanted New Yorker.    The decor was great felt like being on the streets of the city and the staff was very friendly and worked like a well oiled machine!  They were very nice and came around to ask how we were doing and how the food was.    We ordered a Wall Street with a pitcher of pumpkin harvest beer.  It was very good.  The pizza was cooked perfectly, perfectly seasoned and you got a great mix of all the flavors that paired very well with each other.  The beer was amazing and had great aroma as well which sent it over the top.  All in all it was a great experience not just a meal!"}
{"text":"The food isn't insanely good but it's yummy. Where this place takes the cake is the EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE! They go above and beyond which can sometimes be lacking in Scottsdale.   I'll be loyal simply because of how wonderfully they have treated me/us."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service needs serious help.  On our last visit, one of the bussers started clearing my plate before I was finished.  When I told her I wasn't yet done, she actually picked up the pizza with her hands to set it back on my plate.  Of course, after seeing that, I was no longer hungry.  My advice - train your staff better.  If the service matched the food, perhaps you'd get better reviews."}
{"text":"I am updating my previous review as whatever issue we had encountered, seems to have been ironed out. I couldn't completely write off NYPD, I just had hope. I didn't take them up on their offer to rectify the issues, I just every now and then would revisit with hope on my own without offers, or whatever. For fine pizza this is really the best."}
{"text":"Went here last day of school, for lunch, and was busy of course. Our waiter Arthur, was real nice and was sorry about the wait, but it was busy, and really not a bad wait at all,no problem. We had a large \"Big Kahuna\" for three people. I had two slices and the two teens, had three each and we were all stuffed. This is a great \"Not to thin\" thin pizza. LOVE the crust. This is  a simple, casual place, just nice to relax and enjoy your pizza. Arthur made sure our drinks were always full, he was really moving, good man.  Another great Pizza here is the Gluten free. Comes in one size, like most pizza joints, but it is really good, really, I wouldn't lie. So I have to give this NYPD a big WOO HOO!!!"}
{"text":"These guys have a nice lunch deal.  I received a coupon in the mail for two slices of any pizza and a drink for $5.99 at lunch.  I enjoyed two large slices of pepperoni and an iced tea.  When I got my bill I saw that they charged me only $5.95.  I saved an extra four cents!  At these prices, I'll be back again for lunch."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I must give my once favorite Pizza place only 2 stars today.  Something is different about their pizza/pizza making.  Not the quality we've been used to for 13 or so years...."}
{"text":"The pizza is good and slightly better than Barro's, but be warned you will pay a decent amount of coin to get that slightly better than Barro's pizza. Went there today and realized two things (1) the pizza is awesome (2) the pizza is expensive.  I ordered two large two topping pizzas and the total was $42. Compare that to Barro's where you can get the same thing for $19. Maybe it's me but I can't taste the $23 difference.   With that being said, the food here is outstanding and it has a nice New York charm to it. The pizza is pretty authentic in comparison to that in New York. If you are willing to pay for it, then I would suggest this spot.  Kids eat free on Wednesdays, so maybe the average family can afford it then.  All in all NYPD Pizza is worth a try."}
{"text":"This is a great casual location to enjoy pizza, calzones, pasta, and sandwiches. The walls are full of NYC memorabilia like pictures of Broadway shows and signs from the subway.   Service is friendly and attentive. Our waitress kept gladly bringing paper plates for the four year old to draw on and brought out the kid's spaghetti with the meatballs and the sauce on the side per our request.   The food is great and the prices are just right. Their claim to fame is that they make their pizza dough with filtered water imported from NYC."}
{"text":"last ditch Christmas eve take home pizza...ok...I ordered it on line and went and picked it up..they kept me waiting anyway...I asked for extra crisp...might as well have asked for extra raw...just to much dough..ingredients just laid on top of mushy dough...flavors..so so...would never go there again thanks...."}
{"text":"I most definitely have a love - hate relationship with this restaurant. On one hand, the pizza tastes really good. Be it Sicilian style, or hand tossed, this is the best East Coast style pizza you can get in Arizona (when it is made well, of course). My biggest problem, which tends to be the problem with most NYPDs in the valley, is the service. In fact, that's the reason I have to give this location three stars. The service is consistently inconsistent. I've gone into the restaurant to eat and pickup, but most often get delivery. From burnt crusts to forgotten orders (tonight's screw up), there seems to be an issue every other time I take a chance on this place. The managers and staff are pretty quick to correct their mistakes, and I've even received a free meal on several occasions (including tonight), but if I could have one wish, it would be that NYPD get their act together and offer service that matches the quality of their food."}
{"text":"The NYPD brand itself is the best for pizza in AZ. It's the closest you'll get to real New York pizza. This location, however, has horrible service. Tonight was definitely the last I'll ever order here. Placed a phone order, went to pick up, and not only was my pizza not ready, the staff acted as though my call was never made. No offer to do anything but make me one. I passed. Truly disappointing."}
{"text":"Today's visit to NYPD Pizza was great, especially because of the first class service provided by Junior, Server.  Junior displayed such a positive attitude and provided constant professionalism during my visit.  Junior genuinely cared about exceeding my expectations.   I highly recommend that you visit NYPD Pizza and ask for Junior.  Thank you."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza in Phoenix! We also ordered the fried zucchini which was awesome! The wings are VERY delicious and the service was amazing. We had a young lady Tatum who served us Sunday 9th at 8pm. We were a group of four and she was on top of everything! Fast, efficient, accurate and she is even brought out our pizza to see if it was crispy enough (we asked for crispy when we ordered)!!!This girl deserves to be recognized for her excellent service! Tatum you go girl!!! I was a server for 8 years and she puts me to shame. Thanks for the great service and excellent food  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Camelback IPA on tap, try it if you like IPA. Greek salad is so so. The ingredients needed to be chopped up and tossed.  Lettuce is usually not an ingredient of a true Greek salad. Pizza looks great. Pizza is \"Frans  Favorite\". We added crumbled sausage and forgot to ask for extra crispy.  Darn. Pizza is very flavorful . Good and quick service. Thank you NYPD PIZZA."}
{"text":"Lara runs an amazing store! Have been eating here since it opened years ago and it keeps getting better... Lori was super helpful... even at 10:16 at night, they are awesome!"}
{"text":"My family and I have used NYPD Pizza for many years and when they are good,they are good.  This time though,they were fair. We ordered the Lasagna, Spaghetti and Meatballs and a Chicken Parm Sandwich. The Lasagna was good, The Spaghetti and Meatballs was good,but a bit dry and the Chicken Parm Sandwich was good except the Bread, which was very greasy. The wait time to pick it up was overly long. We called it in at 5:15 pm and was told in 20- 25 minutes it would be ready. My wife got there at 5:45 and waited another 35 mins for it.  I think they never cooked our meals until my wife got there. They did apologize and gave a 10.00 off coupon when we came back again. Actually,they should have at least given something off for our dinner to begin with, for waiting all that time for a pick up dinner,not towards our next visit. So I am hoping they get their act together the next time. Yes,there will be a next time,but this time a bit disappointing.."}
{"text":"I ordered the calzone, it was delicious loaded with meat and cheese.  Staff are courteous and helpful.  Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Ordered from NYPD Pizza a few time here in our office. We are about 2 blocks away. It takes them over an hour to get us our pizza. They also charge a deliver fee which is fine but don't expect a huge tip when it takes over and hour to get our overpriced pizza. Well the driver wasn't too fond that we tipped him a few bucks on top of the delivery fee and stormed out of our office cussing and making a seen and drove off in a fit of rage. This is the second time this has happened from this same delivery guy. We called in to talk to the manager and he was nothing but rude and did nothing about the situation. We will not be ordering pizza from this place ever again!"}
{"text":"Love this place, great lunch deal for this side of town. Fast service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Slow as molasses! Don't go here if you want service. If I could I would have gone in the kitchen and cooked my own pizza. The employees here do not want to work."}
{"text":"Went here early afternoon on Saturday. We showed up as a party of 15 bring 5 adults and 10 kids. We were trying to feed the kids quick in between ice hockey games. The staff were absolutely amazing! They were quick with everything. Extremely accommodating for our needs in which a short time frame.  I will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Do you know pizza?  Or is pizza an acquaintance to you?   Is pizza a long-term relationship, or is it the Betty that you picked up at Dos Gringos on a Friday afternoon?  If you are truly a student of pizza, you know this:  it's all about the water stupid.  It really shouldn't be a secret why za in NY and C-town is so good.  Hence, apply this rationale and you know the secret to NYPD.  Great za in Phoenix, AZ???  You bet!  Pizza starts with the crust.  Without great crust, you can't have great za.  But...if you make your crust with the exact mineral content of water from Yonkers, NY....you have a great crust!  Top it off with a spicy (not sweet) sauce, and moz that is of good quality and melt, and abracadabra....there it is.  Way to go NYPD...pride in za making....and real ovens too!  Conveyor belt pizza is crapola, meant for California.  I give it my 2nd highest 'sausage and pepperoni' rating, from the NY Pizza Guy."}
{"text":"Decent pizza for a chain.  We ordered a side of meatballs which were just ok.  There was too much bread crumbs and not enough spices.  We ordered the \"thin crust\" which isn't what you normally expect.  The \"thin crust\" was really just the standard pizza crust.  Would come back but definitely not very memorable."}
{"text":"So, this review is more based off of the service, not the food.   We walked in on a Saturday night after a full day of moving, ready to eat some pizza. It was busy, but not packed. I told the young lady how many and she said 25-30 mins. I then rudely blurted out, \"that's dumb\". It was the exhaustion, my apologize. However, it seemed to catch her off guard, and it worked. The 30 mins quickly turned into 5. There were empty tables for pete sake!   Once seated we were greeted by a friendly waiter. He was very nice, but I think he came by maybe 2 times after taking our order. They brought out pizza with no plates. I had to ask 3 different servers for things. The manager finally came by to clear off our table and offer us our check.   So, food was good. Service sucked."}
{"text":"We love this place. The pizza is delish, almost as good as back east. Clean. Friendly service. Bar. You can get slices!!! Lunch is fast. We had a fabulous salad and shared a large 5 topping choose your own. It was colorful. Fresh. And really hit the spot. Everything coming out of the kitchen looked very tempting. Give it a try. I think you will come back. There was one in chandler that we used to go to, but the landlord thought he could get a better restaurant. Wrong. It keeps changing hands and the locals miss NYPD!! There is one at the airport we will try on our next trip back east."}
{"text":"Those fried pizza doughnuts are to die for. I literally travel out my way just to get them."}
{"text":"This is an updated review. After having a not so pleasant delivery experience I decided to give this place an second shot before leaving town.  Let me just say I retract my previous comparison of this establishments pizza to Sam's Club pizza. The pizza here is far beyond warehouse pizza or most pizza. The key here is having it fresh out the oven. You can taste the difference in flavor when you bite in to a fresh pizza vs one which has been removed from the oven and makes it to you 45 minutes later.  Per my last review this business does offer great ingredients. From the homemade Mac & Cheese sauce to the freshly made pizza. I ordered the Brooklyn Family lunch special and an individual Wall Street Pizza with a side of wings.   Service was top notch for my visit and will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Awesome salad options and their garlic knots are amazing!!!!!!!! We could just eat those and be happy. Their pizza is a much better quality than some of the other options around. Will be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cooked in a real stone oven. Tastes better than the tpical \"New York\" style pizza in the area.  They also have pastas, salads, soups, wings. Oh -- and how could I forget -- Garlic Knots! They're yummy enough to break my South Beach Diet for.  It is a chain, but this is an especially nice location; We've had real good service here so far (knock on wood)."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Pizza orders are about 30 minutes. Cheese knots were very good. Made my own pizza, place has no beef (hamburger). Dont know if thats local or not as I'm from Texas. Reg size water cups not child size. Service was a bit slow as it seemed one waitress for the lunch rush. All in all recommend."}
{"text":"The pizza..Now I've had way better pizza at other places BUT if you are looking for pasta or a sandwich this is the place. They also have great appeitizers and deserts. I just wouldn't recommened the pizza."}
{"text":"Maybe it's not normally this way but it took us over two hours to get our food and checks. Really slow. Too bad."}
{"text":"So I gave the folks at this NYPD location a pretty bad review a few weeks back. Must say I was impressed that the owners contacted me personally and asked me - in a very constructive way - for details about what specific issues I had with the restaurant. After giving them an earful, they advised me that they had shared some of the concerns I expressed and recently changed their management of this location. In the interest of full disclosure, I must say that they also gave me a gift certificate. But I  purposely went back and tried the place a few more times so that I could be honest about my revised review. In short, I think the service and management of this particular location is much improved. Again, I love the location and ambiance of this location. It has a very urban feel. And I am not saying it is perfect. But it now has more attentive service and the workflow of who is responsible for what tables and other responsibilities seems to be better. I even witnessed a manager getting after an employee who had neglected to check on our food and left it sitting for a couple of minutes under the hot lamp. It is nice to see them on top of things. So I am updating my review and wishing the best of luck to the folks at NYPD. Keep up the responsive attitude and I am sure your downtown eatery will be a big success."}
{"text":"Every-time we have gone there the food was great! Place was clean and they have  a small seating area they use as a bar, so you can get you slice and a good cold brew.  What more do you need \"for get about it\"     A+ service"}
{"text":"They have vegan pizza! I really enjoyed the pizza, I will say though with the dairy free cheese ask for the pizza Crispy and use fresh vegetables. The artichoke and red peppers bring out the saltiness of the cheese substitute. Super excited about NYPD Pizza! Wish it was just a little less expensive."}
{"text":"Ordered the Italian Wedding Soup, and the Italian Sausage+Peppers a la Vodka.  Both were extremely underwhelming.  The soup was almost bitter, an overpowering celery flavor destroyed any attempt to enjoy it.  Also of note, as a result of this it tasted nothing like any Italian wedding soup I've ever had.  This is further reinforced by it's complete lack of any meatballs (a staple in this soup, under all circumstances).    The pasta was dry (lacking sauce), and a little mushy (the bad, way overcooked kind of mushy).  The sausage in the pasta, however, was outstanding.  The sauce needs to be thickened and the pasta cooked correctly so they adhere to one another.  The absolutely overwhelming amount of basil(?) placed on top of the pasta - I assume for decoration - was also a gigantic turnoff.  Nobody wants to open a vodka/pasta dish and see 3/4 of the surface green - it was just ridiculous.  We'll try them, and review them, again.  But these are two pretty basic staples that unfortunately fell very short of even \"I haven't eaten all day, I just want food\" expectations."}
{"text":"First time ordering from NYPD. Ordered half Big Kahuna and half Pesto with tomato. Both were delicious! Crust was crispy, but not burnt, and toppings were generous and balanced. Loved the flavored, price is reasonable and love that they let you combine flavors! Staff was super friendly and attentive both on the phone and in person when I went to pick it up. Would recommend to friends and will definitely be coming back to try more pizza combinations!"}
{"text":"I always get the pizza to go but I have to say, I'm a big fan of their pies.  They do a great job of making a perfect crust every time and the sauce they use is great.  Everyone that I have interacted with there has been nice.  I will continue to come back as a returning customer to get pizza from them!"}
{"text":"pricey but worth it.  they delivered fast, their large was 18 sweaty inches, and because i'm in a house with 14 other people i decided that i was going to take that whole 18 inches myself. i sat back, leaned over the table, and tried to relax. I wasn't able to put the whole 18 inches away, but I was close. A new record! i was pretty sore afterward, but It's understandable. it's not every day you try to stuff 18 inches into you."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza in Arizona! For years I have tried to find NY style pizza and no one can do it except for NYPD Pizza. Every time I am in the area, I will always order from them!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite NYPD. They definitely hipped the place up to be in such an urban location. I've been here quite a few times since moving nearby and have never had bad service. In fact, during my most recent visit, a server came and greeted us even though we weren't in his section. The other server was busy, so he took over to make sure we didn't have to sit and wait around. Pretty good if you ask me.   As far as food goes, NYPD has what I consider fairly decent pizza. I like it for something fairly commercial and comfortable. However, I am a huge fan of their garlic knots! Love those little things. I also tried a calzone recently and it was pretty good too.   Overall, if you're looking for some kind of fancy, upscale pizza, then NYPD is probably not the place to go. But if you're looking for good comfort food with a little bit of funky atmosphere, then this is the place to go. This is definitely on my list of regular spots to visit."}
{"text":"Received our pizza after an hour of waiting to find it wasn't the right style and that all the sauce, cheese and toppings had made its way off our pizza and into the corner of the box. Tried to race down the driver but he booked it before we could find him. Called and they are sending a replacement pizza....super disappointing that we have to wait possibly another hour...  Updated to add: I'm not in California. No clue how to change it. I'm in surprise AZ"}
{"text":"Nypd is one of our favorite pizza places to go. I am a fan of thinner crust pizza, as opposed to thick crust. This is one of the reasons that I like nypd. The pizza always tastes great. I'm not sure that I have ever had a pizza that wasn't good. I have always had pizza when I have gone there so I can not comment on their pastas.   I have had their zucchini and mozzarella appetizers and they are both very good. This time around we have the zucchini. Once again it was very good. My wife and I ordered the Brooklyn family and it was, as always delicious. One of the best things about NYPD is that on Wednesday's kids eat free off the kids menu when and adult entree is purchased. My kids both got the pizza bites, which is just a slice of pizza cut into pieces. To close out the evening you have to have the Zeppolis. They are pretty amazing!"}
{"text":"Me and my boys came by and had the meat lovers and a buffalo pizza. The large pizza is huge and lots of take hoe. Service was good."}
{"text":"My favorite local pizza joint! The pesto pizza is my favorite! Originally from Chicago, I'm picky about my pizza, and the fact that there is a NY in the name of this place scared me away for a long time....but im glad I finally tried it. Definitely not your typical soggy, greasy, floppy new york style here."}
{"text":"Tucked back next to Frys, one of our favorite pizza places in the valley for take out! Always good for a crowd too, reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Yikes! Where do I begin......  Well it started off with my mom deciding we should order food from here to pick up for dinner. She called and ordered a large pizza: half plain/ half pineapple, 1 cheese calzone, and 1 order of garlic knots. The person on the phone told her to come pick it up in 30 minutes.  30 minutes later we arrive at the restaurant and it is a zoo. I head inside to try to pick up the order and was told it would be a few more minutes. They gave me a cup for a complimentary small soda while I waited.  Well, 1 complimentary small soda turned into 2 complimentary small sodas and a visit from my Mom who got tired of waiting in the car. Another 30 minutes had gone by and we were finally given our food. It was all cold by the time we got home and had to be re-heated.  We chose this place because in past years, it was the only place to get a decent, NY style piece of pizza in Arizona. Well, now I'm not sure if there is a decent NY style piece of pizza in Arizona. The pizza was undercooked and covered in oil (took me 3 napkins to remove it). I took one bite and refused to eat any more of it.   The garlic knots and calzone were decent but not decent enough to redeem this experience.   I'll avoid pizza on my next vacation and just have a decent slice when I get back to NY!"}
{"text":"I visit Phoenix occasionally for work and have passed by this pizza place several times. In the evening, the you can see inside the restaurant from the street and it has always looked very inviting. I had some time tonight and was on the hunt for pizza.   I stopped in and was immediately greeted by a server named Vanda. She was awesome. Very attentive and took some extra time to help me decide what to have for dinner. Vanda made an appearance often. I don't like when I have to scan a restaurant to see if my server went home for the night. Vanda stopped by the table often to check in on me.   I had a Fall Harvest Salad and a Mott Street Pizza. The salad was amazing. It had pears, dried cranberries, almonds, gorgonzola cheese with a Zinfandel vinaigrette. The pizza had pepperoni, sausage, bacon, meatball, bell pepper, and tomatoes.   I just found my favorite pizza joint in Phoenix. I'm not sure what will cause me to return more - the great food or the great service. I guess it's both... perfect combo. The restaurant is clean and the decor simple and perfect. Music and TV's.   I'll be back for that Fall Harvest Salad tomorrow since I ate just about the entire pizza by myself. 5 Stars! Check 'em out!!"}
{"text":"The garlic knots are to die for.....i could eat a huge bowl for them for my meal.  I really, really, really hate that they have a wait staff so you have to tip. I think it would be more family friendly if you ordered at the counter, took a seat, and waited for your food to be ready to either pick up at the counter or have someone just bring it to the table like other pizza joints."}
{"text":"NEVER  SHOWED WITH MY DELIVERY ORDER!!!Ordered a pizza for delivery at 1:28 pm (45 minit is 2:56 pm the driver called 30 min. Ago and had the wrong address .. gave him the correct address and never showed up.  No call no nothing, just a no show.  Go somewhere else this company doesn't have it together. Will be one of hundred failed pizza joints in the valley.. disappointing."}
{"text":"Me and my husband and our two kids went here Friday night. Great service, Shaina was very sweet and very attentive. The pizza was great. Me and the boys had pepperoni, and a cheese! Classic choice and very good one. Fresh and amazing! We ordered pizza sauce on the side to dip our crust in! Wlthe prices are a little more than we wanted but kids eat free on Wednesdays, and they also offer deals on Groupon! So we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is another eatery on 7th Avenue and McDowell. Close to work and lots of other selections but NYPD has a great lunch selection at a great price. Pizza is always great! Brooklyn is my favorite. But you do have to order the crispy mozzarella if they have it it is the bomb!  Service is always friendly and with a smile."}
{"text":"My last update was in 2010 so I figure I do a re-review.  We came here to celebrate my husband's birthday lunch.  The place was pretty packed for lunch but the service was still great.  I ordered a personal pizza Brooklyn Family style (pepperoni, sausage and fresh basil).  WOW, it was so so GOOD but a little pricey for a 10\" pizza.  Everyone else enjoyed their food too.  We had a great time!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent lunch here last Saturday. It wasn't busy which can sometimes mean poor service, but that was not the case here!!  We had baked ziti and a pizza salad combination. Both were excellent with plenty leftover. Our server was Excellent, refilled my water constantly and kept checking on my hubby's beer to see if he was OK.  Great food, cute and clean environment and superb service. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We returned to this location and a great experience.  The service was much better, our server was diligent about making sure we had everything we needed. The food came out hot, well prepared. Our server checked on us throughout the meal and everything perfect. Thank you for encouraging us to give this location another try!"}
{"text":"The Pizza Blanco rocks my world!  I crave it!!!  THere is something special about the delicious ricotta with the other flavors.  I don't like it with spinach, but go for the tomato instead and have them add fresh basil.  SO delicious!  The salads are also great and the service has always been good."}
{"text":"Great price for delicious pizza. I come here during lunch and order the combo most of the time. Delicious salads too. Service is attentive, friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"I want to commend NYPD for going above and beyond to help me with a birthday surprise.  I contacted the corporate office for NYPD to see if they could assist with a birthday surprise I was planning by creating  a pizza that spelled out \"Happy Birthday\" in pepperoni.  Heather, at their corporate office, was quick to respond and so helpful with connecting me with their Camelback location to see if creating the pizza was something their team could do.  Additionally, she made sure to stay connected and confirmed the day before that the delivery was going to go through the next day.  Torri at the Camelback location immediately got on board once Heather connected us and walked me through the ordering process.  She and her team, specifically the cooks, Luis and Justin , went above and beyond in delivering the birthday surprise.  In addition to the pizza, they included bonus items -- a birthday cheesecake and garlic knots -- to ensure the birthday celebrant knew the Camelback team was celebrating his birthday with him.  I can't say enough good things about the excellent cooperation and service we received from NYPD corporate and Team Camelback.  Their small gesture and willingness to go the extra mile really took this simple birthday surprise from \"kind of cool\" to \"really awesome\"!"}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza with huge slices.  I'll pass on the pasta.  I've been here on the two separate occasions.  First time had the Wall Street Pizza based on suggestion from staff.  Staff is friendly and appreciative.  Pizza was delicious and slices were huge.  Didn't wait long either.  Second visit had a pasta dish with penne and meatballs.  Lots of cheese but the sauce and meatballs lacked flavor.  They also have fast carry out. I finally found my ZA takeout place.  Score!!"}
{"text":"Decent. At best. The dough is bland.  Lacks flavor. Our slices were a mess. We joked about the one jalapeño and one pepperoni per slice. It was busy but still. Need to improve the presentation."}
{"text":"First time eating here and they were very busy. The service was good not fast and not slow. Really good flavorful pizza not a bad price"}
{"text":"Forgettaboutit!  Reminds me of home in NYC!  Awesome pizza and Matt is the best!  Why would you go anywhere else to have pizza in Scottsdale?"}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood pizza place. We come here regularly. We eat in, take out and get delivery. It's consistent and delicious. Tonight, we had an extra special experience. We wanted wings- they have delicious ones- and so we decided to eat in. Our waitress let us know she was new, but she was AWESOME. Kind, on top of it and had good timing. As we were about to leave, a uniformed police officer walked in. We wanted to cover his meal. This week, a PHX police officer was ambushed and died in the line of duty. I asked for the manager and told him we'd like to leave enough $ to cover his ticket along with gratuity. INSTEAD OF TAKING MY $, the manager said, \"I had already planned on covering his ticket. Whoever joins him, it's on us tonight.\" He thanked me for my offer, but said he had it covered. TOP NOTCH LEADERSHIP IN ACTION! Thank you for your service, officer and thank you for being a great neighborhood pizza place NYPD!"}
{"text":"Pizza at its finest ... and wings yes the wings but, they have pasta and alot more! A small place with a big taste ! When you take the first bite well  you will see... while you wait try those garlic knots .. Good service  as well ! They only have a few booths so take it to go  if need be...Perfectly thin crust that you can eat by itself .. there is only two other places that have better Pie Wolf Gang Puck and my house of course.Any way..... here is the thing I thought they were going to pass out when I took half the pizza up to the counter and told them it was not very good .Just needed a box .. if you do not like GOOD Pie do not go here. And did I say wings?they really taste like wings...Please do not let your tongue beat your lips to death when you see this..."}
{"text":"The location is great & so is the staff.  The thing is... It's EXPENSIVE!  I can go to MOD, Sauce, Pizza Your Way, or Fired Pie and spend 1/2 as much.  $65 for 3 pizzas vs $35 is a big difference!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited NYPD pizza yesterday. We decided on dinner there due to a groupon we had. We had a great waiter. Very friendly and didn't seem rushed. We started with the zucchini sticks for an appetizer. The pieces of zucchini were crispy and fresh. Very good. We also had the SoHo salad. It was so good! I would definitely get that again next time. It was a salad on top of a crisp like pizza crust! It had feta, almonds, bruschetta and a really good dressing. I would recommend that to everyone!! We also got a small white pizza. We were pretty full by then, so we had left overs. But that pizza was really good too. You get a choice of spinach or tomatoes on the pizza, we chose spinach. Very good!  We are always impressed with NYPD pizza and are so glad it is so close to our house!"}
{"text":"Reading through these reviews makes me think that I may have been the only person to stumble upon the wonderful masterpiece that is NYPD's Baked Ziti.   Everyone listening? I'm reviewing their Baked Ziti NOT their pizza. It's the perfect combination of cheese, pasta and sauce. You get the rich flavor of their tomato sauce without being overwhelmed by it. The cheese is really the star of this dish and the sauce lets it shines.  The Pièce de résistance is the garlic knots that come on the side. Perfect addition to the best meal in the restaurant.  The reason why I say 4 out of 5 stars is because I can wait for quite a few minutes for are refill and to get the maximum enjoyment out of the meal I need to have my Diet Coke DURING the meal, not afterwords."}
{"text":"Great pizza place. My favorite pizza is the white pizza. Their ricotta cheese tastes amazing."}
{"text":"REALLY love their pizza because it reminds me of what I grew up on at the Jersey Shore. When my family comes to visit, we always order NYPD (although they do balk at the prices--don't expect $5.99 for a pie at this place; but if you demand a better quality pizza, give this place a try!)  For lunch, they have a variety of pies for per-slice sale, which is great when you wan to mix it up. Their cold cut sub has tons of meat and is SO much more substantial than what you get at Subway! And the Pepsi from the fountain is the best tasting fountain soda in the Valley! The perfect amount of carbonation and syrup (I don't know why some places seem too heavy on one or the other; and Pepsi is so much harder to find at restaurants).   I love the garlic knots with a side of red sauce. Lots of garlic and butter. Yum!  I've tried all of their salads and my favorite is the Soho, which comes with a pizza crust base (very clever), so if you can't decide between pizza or salad, you don't have to with the Soho! The dressing is a very tasty combination of ranch and vinaigrette and it works SO nicely with this meal. Never disappoints.  The pizza is my favorite. My kids' choice too whenever we go for pizza. NY style crust and you can put anything you want on it. The Bianca and The Brooklyn are the adult's favorite and my brother favors bacon and pineapple. Always delish.  The zeppolis for dessert are my favorite. Hot, sweet and enough for the whole table!  Recently, I tried the calzone and I wasn't impressed at all. I'll be sticking with pizza/salads from now on. Oh, and we had a bad experience with their pizza cookie (rock hard!) once and never ordered it again.  Service is also always good, from the people who greet you at the door, to the counter help and the wait staff--consistently helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"The food is normally very good when going into the restaurant and ordering.  Today, I ordered via their website and my order was not ready at the time specified for pickup.  In fact, the order took an additional 30 minutes.  I should have by-passed the online order and just gone in as it would have been faster.  I'm very, very disappointed in their service."}
{"text":"We've eaten pizza in well over 100 countries, and many places in the USA.  I have to admit my surprise time after time, at the quality of NYPD's pizza.  Yep, they are a chain, but who cares when the pizza is pretty darned good every time you go there, and the service is great?"}
{"text":"Another average restaurant. As usual the husband was hungry and wanted somewhere close to home he could get wings. Personally I'm not a wing fan, but knew I could get a salad and he could get his wings at NYPD.  We tried their pizza at another location about five years ago and weren't impressed. I think he enjoyed his wings and my salad was okay.  Our server was great, so we'll give them three stars. NYPD will do in a pinch, but not as a regular place to go."}
{"text":"I have eaten there twice and ordered out a few times. When you order out they tell you it will be 30 minutes. Realistically its 40-45. They have always been nice and gave be a free fountain drink while I wait but now I just come a little later.  The pizza is great, I love it. I always order the Brooklyn and I love the fresh basil on it.  When I have eaten there I had mixed experiences, the first time was great, the second time the server spent more time complaining about her fellow employees than serving us.    I will eat here again and if your in the area I suggest you try it out."}
{"text":"Pizza was soggy,  sauce is like ketchup and salad was old and nasty. I will never ever order anything here again.  I hope people read this and don't eat here.  Little Cescers is 100 times better."}
{"text":"NYPD Pizza is pretty yummy I have to say.  We do love coming here to order our favorite pizza with extra ricotta and meatballs. It's not a pizza on the menu but you can build your own with the items listed.  The crust here is wonderful and you actually want to eat it not leave it! We also got the Big Kahuna Hawaiian pizza and this one was not my favorite. It seemed a little blah for my taste buds. We tried out the Crispy Fresh Mozzarella and it was very flavorful but it was not a very large portion compared to some places.  If we go back, we will order the Garlic Cheese Knots we were eyeing at the table next to us! Those looked so good.   Though I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants.. this one is A-ok!  It can be a touch pricey if you don't watch it."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Everything about it, the ingredients, just the right amount of sauce, the crust. All really good. Not the best I've ever had, but close.  But...  The garlic knots were decent, but not good. The salad was good, not great.  The beer selection was decent."}
{"text":"Updated review : NYPD reached out to me a couple of days after leaving my first review. My family and I went back in roughly a week later and the food was as good as the first time and the service was much better and faster!! Definitely worthy of a 5 star review!!"}
{"text":"I eat at the 7th Ave location weekly for lunch. $7 for two slices and a drink, can't beat it. I go through the express line and then watch sports on the two big screens. Tawnya, the bar tender, even remembers what kind of soda I drink, this place is great, food is great, service is great! Quick and easy, highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Sorry my update is late but I wanted to tell everyone that we went back to NYPD recently and had a great time. Nikki (the CEO - Chief Experience Officer) went above and beyond what we have every experienced from any restaurant with an invitation to come back for dinner on NYPD, as well as refunding our money for the last visit that was not so good (see previous review). At any rate, food was great, service was great, garlic knots were actually garlic knots and the pizza and spaghetti were excellent. We will definitely be returning to NYPD in the future when we want a sit down dinner. Thank you Nikki for whatever you did to get NYPD back up to speed. We are happy to know when we have a concern that NYPD listens and does what is needed to remedy whatever is wrong. In this day and age or poor customer service, it's nice to see there is at least one company out there that truly knows what customer service is all about."}
{"text":"Wife and I had a Groupon for this place so decided why not :). Once inside all we really wanted to do was order to go. There were slices of pizza in a window that you could order but we wanted to order a whole pizza to go. When we asked they told us we needed to be seated in order to order a whole pizza...I was like seriously?!  So we sat down even though we did not want to and ordered a half and half pizza. One side margarheta and one side hawaiian. It was thin and cooked well. The taste was good. I prefer a crispier bottom crust than the one they gave us.  Overall, the pizza was good but the service was odd..."}
{"text":"I get 2-3 pizzas from here a month.  In the last year, i've only had one I wasnt too happy with.  It seemed a little undercooked.. but honestly the other 20-30 times I've gotten pizza there its been good.  I'd eat here more but it is a bit more expensive than I like to pay for pizza."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner last night. The cheesy garlic knots and the pizza were good. The service was friendly, but slow. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Finally - awesome pizza in Chandler! What took me so long to try ths place?  Excellent white pizza for husband and yummy ham, olive, artichoke pizza for me - not swimming in sauce like other pizza places AND the sauce is really good!  Lasagna and Vodka Penne also really good.  AND they deliver-yeah!"}
{"text":"I was asked to never set foot on the premises again. of thIs subpar Italian restaurant today. I walked out of a ticket on Sunday because they could not figure out how to make a calzone into a flatbread. To sum up their \"General Manager,\" \"We've had some major problems lately. Either we can't make what you want or you do not like it. My managerial staff is getting uncomfortable. We think it's best of we part ways.\" I'm ok with this because as a REAL chef, I know good food. There was never any flavor to the simplest of things. Greasy pizza, managers who were always on their cell phone on the floor and frozen desserts are just some of the things you will find here. I was a regular for three years and kept going back because they did have some excellent servers. There are other pizza places that know how to make real pizza. Hell, my students make better food than NYPD!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had the pizza/caesar salad combo.  I went with the sausage/pepperoni pizza and I must say, it wasn't bad!  I know that they pre make the pizzas and re-heat them for you so I can only imagine the pizza being better when ordering a fresh one (which I'm looking forward to!).  The caesar was very good!  Another bonus, got 10% off for being a local employee!  And to the people that think that they're pricey must be used to ordering from the $1 menu from McDonalds or going to Taco Bell.  The combo I got was under $6 and I was full!  I think someone else posted that they only offer dine in on the weekends?  I was there during the week and the hostess asked us which we wanted--sit down or counter service...maybe they have changed it since that review.  I definitely look forward to trying them out again!  Finally, a Chicagoan found great pizza in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Went with a couple guys from work.  Being new to the area...kind of anxious to find some \"good pizza.\"  Still searching.  This isn't bad...it's just pizza.  I'd stop in again, but like so many others...nothing that I've \"gotta have.\"  The garlic knots that were raved about I didn't find to be up to the hype.  Their flavor didn't \"pop.\"  Not enough of a garlic flavor to them.  Kind of like soft, fluffy, buttered rolls.  It was all good...just not 5 star break down the door gotta have it good."}
{"text":"NYPD just opened at Arrowhead and is a great place to eat.  They didn't do a big grand opening, so business still seems to be friends and family (I am neither, but had been monitoring the construction of the location).  I'd highly recommend, and I am in fact a New Yorker."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza. I did venture and get a Beef Sandwich, which was too dry, so skip that. The pizza is on point."}
{"text":"It's a small little place hidden in the corner with a few other stores buy the Circle K. They have good specials on the pizza, so you can't really complain on that. They add the toppings you want throw it back in the oven and let it cook.   Pizza is pretty good. You get some big slices. The special is for 2 but I'm sure 1 slice would fill up most people. It is kind of greasy though so that kind of kills it a bit but the flavor is pretty good.   The staff is friendly and easy going and just fun to carry on a conversation with as you wait for the pizza.   All in all it's not top of the line pizza but def not the worst, so if you're need in something to eat I'd recommend you stop."}
{"text":"First I'd like to say that I was contacted by the restaurant regarding my previous visit. I was impressed with their commitment to great customer service. They took the feedback I could provide them & they even sent me a dinner voucher.   I visited the same location again this past weekend. As soon as I walked in I was promptly greeted, given a choice as to where to sit & my drink order was placed. I didn't get any of those last time, so I was already happy as a fiddle!   I was attended to by my waiter PLUS an additional 3 people who were helping him.   This is still a place were you need to have plenty of time on your hands if you want to eat there. We had planned on going to the mall after our dinner, but changed our minds when we realized we'd been there for nearly 2 hours. I highly recommend you place your meal order at the same time as your appetizer, & that you don't dawdle on making your choices. We didn't. The waiter did tell us when we placed our pizza order that it would take 20 to 30 minutes for the pizza to be ready. It took exactly 30 minutes, so at least they were being honest, lol.  My daughter was less than thrilled with the chopped salad that we shared, it was really bland & the pizzas (I had the one with ham & pineapple & she had one with sausage) had little to no sauce. We are both sauce girls & maybe we should have asked for extra sauce when we placed the order.   Regardless, service was definitely improved. I'd recommend this place for leisurely lunches & dinners with family or friends."}
{"text":"Omg!! Best pizza ever!!!!! Seriously. If you have never had fresh ricotta heaped on a garlicy, chewy, authentic NY crust, you're missing out on everything!! Buffalo Caesar salad was yummy too! This pizza is worth an extra long drive!"}
{"text":"My brother introduced me to this pizza joint.  The service and the food is phenomenal.    The atmosphere is great.  Our new go to place for Friday family pizza night!  FYI- you have to try their Fall Harvest salad and Fran's favorite pizza.  So yummy!"}
{"text":"I was at Fry's and I wanted some pizza and I see NYPD - I thought they would sell individual slices, but we had to order a full pizza. So my husband and I ordered the pepperoni gluten free pizza to go. The employees were friendly and it was about $17 - a little higher than another pizza joint that serves gluten free pizza, which I won't name. They tell us it will be about twenty minutes so they told us to grab a drink and wait. We finally got home and started digging in - it wasn't the best gluten free pizza I've had, but it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"We had a couple of Deal Chicken coupons for this joint, so we came on back to back Sundays to redeem.  This was the first time I dined in.  Normally, we order delivery.  I can tell you that dining in is a very good experience.  The server remembered us from the week before and greeted us with a warm hello and smile.  Her name is Ashley and she's awesome.  She made sure we were well taken care of and that our drink glasses were always full.  Another standout  employee is one of the cooks.  I didn't get his name, but he took the Pizza out of the oven and brought it to our table before he cut it to make sure it was cooked to our desired crispiness.  We like our Pizza well-done and he wouldn't slice it up until we gave him the thumbs up.  Both visits we didn't have to send it back, they got the crispiness done properly the first time.  We ordered:  Family sized Brooklyn Family Pizza (Pepperoni, Sausage, Basil), $21.49 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=Q61H5MQsP_7pOjeVF_DwFg#Q61H5MQsP_7pOjeVF_DwFg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=prumSXcrD0Eozq3Rx7pWVQ#prumSXcrD0Eozq3Rx7pWVQ  Family sized Mott Street Meat Lover Pizza (Pepperoni, Sausage, Meatball), $21.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=63hD4U7PKOLnonxA--8XAQ#63hD4U7PKOLnonxA--8XAQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=pO92ZpZdDaN1LGtSCi_KnA#pO92ZpZdDaN1LGtSCi_KnA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=XdIo9EZWyEgtcCQmqmI_gg#XdIo9EZWyEgtcCQmqmI_gg  Chicken Wings, $8.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=Zc5dliKkTzXw1arLmXSf-w#Zc5dliKkTzXw1arLmXSf-w  Garlic Cheese Knots, $4.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=uW_tFc4M2RIs8KG6QWS2FA#uW_tFc4M2RIs8KG6QWS2FA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-5?select=5p3iujrt6uR9OkTX51GZRQ#5p3iujrt6uR9OkTX51GZRQ  Everything was good.  The Pizza is awesome of course.  I'm a huge fan of their Pizza.  The Wings are OK, not great.  The Garlic Cheese Knots are outstanding, which surprised me.  They're not really \"knots\", but more like a fluffy dinner roll covered with Melted Cheese, Butter, and Garlic....pure heaven!  Once you have one, you can't stop eating them.  Overall, the dine-in experience was awesome.  I highly recommend giving it a try if you like Pizza and are in the area.  Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"Thanks to Groupon we gave this location a try.  It's a little farther from our neighborhood than our regular NYPD Pizza location....but for a 50% off deal, we'll make the extra drive.  I'm happy to report that this location is as good as the our favorite on Raintree.  We dined in and were seated upstairs near the bar.  It's pretty dark up there and it's more quiet than downstairs, which was jam packed with people dining in, plus all of the people picking up orders.  If you want more privacy, upstairs is the way to go.  We ordered the Garlic Cheese Knots as an appetizer and the Brooklyn Family Pizza (Sausage, Pepperoni) and added Salami to it.  We like our Pizza well done and they know how to do that here...it came out perfectly. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-3?select=CbOVy7I3aQgoyWfMOB-MeA#CbOVy7I3aQgoyWfMOB-MeA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nypd-pizza-scottsdale-3?select=s57CGAyhkoHxP4HNCkV31w#s57CGAyhkoHxP4HNCkV31w  The Garlic Cheese Knots are awesome too...and they're huge!

{"text":"Yummy food. Had the Hawaiian Pizza and Turkey Foccocia sandwich. Everything at just the right pace. Server Aundrea was GREAT!"}
{"text":"Have previously gone to location in Surprise and it was always very good. We moved and tried this location. Ordered online and went to pick up. Came home and realized they didn't give us our soda. And discovered one of the Calzones we got was completely the wrong one. And I got a sandwich I always got at the Surprise location, but the one here was not the same. This was a one and done."}
{"text":"I will never order from this place again. Every time we order they always forget something or mess up our order and it's not like they are cheap or even reasonable but we still ordered from there. This last time the Manager took my order and he screwed it up. Onions were in our salads and marinara was on the meatballs after I asked not for it on there. Annoyed I wanted to sign my credit card receipt. There wasn't one. I called to ask where it was and the manager tried telling me that they couldn't print one out. Are you kidding me!? Not even an itemized bill!!! I was pissed and said I want a receipt of my transaction or I'm calling corporate at which time they decided to charge my card a second time!!!! Now I have to wait till the transaction comes out of pending for my money to be added back onto my account!! I asked him why he charged my account again and he couldn't give me an answer. I don't know why it took us this long to finally give them a bad review. They are never consistent and always forget our sides for our order. Now I'm waiting on corporate which has not responded to me yet. Great customer service. Be careful when you order from this place. Pay cash and don't use your card or better yet order from somewhere else. It's sad that they can't get it together. Never again consumer beware. Contact the better business bureau also and already contacted my bank about there transaction. Never again. Done with them. I have never had such poor service and never have a spoken to a manager who seemed so lost. Also we are from New York and this pizza is nothing like that at all!!"}
{"text":"Sooooooooooo good! Best NY style pizza. Only draw back is the prices. Very expensive!!!! If the prices were more reasonable ($22 for a large with extra cheese is wayyyyy to much) I would order way more often. Speaking from others I have asked, they all say the same thing! Wish I took a pic of it cause it sure was as delish as it looked!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. The service not so good. We made reservations for 25 and there were 20 of us that showed up. We got there at 1:30 and left at 3:30. They just needed more help. As a large group we will not be going back. Food I would give five star. Service a one star for a group."}
{"text":"Soot on my pizza, a register Chickie who is too young to serve a beer...  I stopped for a slice...great prices...good sauce...outstanding crust and toppings...BUT YOU GOT SOOT ON MY CHEESE!  Because of your airport location and the number of people always in line, as well as my getting the slice to go so I had something to eat on the plane, I was unable to take the slice back and show it to someone who could do something about it.  Your prices are very fair, your pizza certainly has potential...anything you can do to educate the person who got soot on my pizza will help.  Yer gonna save yourself a WHOLE lot of time and gain more customers if you get someone old enough to pour a beer to run the register.  That way, the folks who order a beer can pay, get their beer and receipt and clear the register to help the next customer.  Having to wait while the cashier gets someone old enough to pull a beer is not an effective use of time or personnel..."}
{"text":"Very quick delivery and great basic pizza. Not a fan of the atmosphere in the restaurant, but the waiters are always very friendly and helpful. Order the garlic cheese bread- it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Came in around 830 and debated it because it was so close to close, but we went in anyways. Our server was Steven was amazing! I, as a manager expect my employees to give the same service to a guest coming in 5 minutes to close the same service they would give a guest let's say around lunch. He delivered! I was very impressed! The food was also good. We got the garlic knots and a large pizza! We will definitely be back to this location!"}
{"text":"Visited this past weekend with some friends and the food and service here were amazing!  Wish i lived closer! My x-GF was there too but did not notice! #close call :-/"}
{"text":"GARLIC KNOTS. You must order them.  Usually has a 15-30 minute wait on Fri/Sat night. We usually try to go for lunch, less crowded, same great pizza still offered.   There are a few tv's in the bar that will have on a game, don't count on seeing the tv's from all seats in the dining area however. There's a patio but we rarely see people sitting there, maybe its just too hot. They do deliver, but then you miss out on the fun atmosphere and neat NYC inspired decor."}
{"text":"I'm not a professional pizza reviewer by any means, but I know good service, good food and a good restaurant when I see one. NYPD's slick modern decor and friendly service staff was the perfect first impression. My husband and I sat at a booth, tucked away and private, browsing over the menu until a smiley waitress came over to see if we had any questions.   I ordered a local ally brewed Mill Blonde Ale which was the perfect pairing with our Brooklyn Family and Big Kahuna slices of pizza. The fresh tomato sauce and toppings were spread creating a perfectly portioned thin crust pizza.  For starters we ordered the Crispy Fresh Mozzarella, which I would have ate as a meal all by itself! The fresh mozzarella was breaded to a crisp on top of a bed of green spinach lettuce accompanied by deliciously red tomato slices. The sauces included a thick balsamic and chunky red sauce for dipping.   We finished off the evening stub a Cookies N' Cream chocolate chip pan cookie topped with vanilla ice cream whipped cream and a cherry to share. It was a perfectly cooked, warm and gooey,  treat after a hearty meal.  Overall, the experience was delightful and the small serving staff makes it feel homey with reduced chaos compared to other Pizza Restaurants."}
{"text":"There are many things I appreciate in life, two of them are pizza and customer service.   NYPD Pizza is off the hizzle for shizzle! The dough/crust is good, nice balance of flavors, and the right amount of topping makes NYPD Pizza one of my favs.   Their customer service is a good as their pizza! Shout out to my peeps Ro, Alicia, Ryan and Zach...you rock!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat pizza and calzones in the west valley. Food is great and the staff is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Great pizza and very nice restaurant in general. I also scheduled a diver for next and the manager actual took my order and provide great service."}
{"text":"Just plain old NY style pizza and hot wings are very good.  I don't care for anything else on the menu so stick to these two things.  The Italian dishes are not good at all!"}
{"text":"We tried the pizza and it was delicious!! The ambience is good too. Service was good except it took quite a while for our pizza and dessert, so for this reason I give 4 stars. Hope this place stays around!!"}
{"text":"Great little dive. Larger on the inside than you would expect. The wall decor immerses you in the feel of a New York pizzeria. Bonus: VEGAN CHEESE is available! It is a soy-based, nondairy alternative, and it melted well. Can't believe I haven't ever done a check in here. There is a mellow mushroom close to where I live, but I will drive the extra distance to go here when I can."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza spots. I don't dine in often (when we did the service was meh). Carryout is the way to go! Delicious pizza without the annoyance of inattentive staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I were already fans of NYPD but we usually frequent the location closer to our home in Scottsdale. We happened to be in the area so we decided to try out this location. Now we knew the food would be great but what really set this location over the top for us was our waitress, Jayme. She was seriously one of the best waitresses we have encountered and we dine out quite frequently. Not only was she attentive but she was very helpful and super friendly. She was just one of those people that you can tell enjoys her job and that was great to have on Saturday Date Night. For dinner we split an order of wings, half buffalo and half barbecue for my husband since he is allergic to Buffalo  (aka he can't handle the heat). The wings for me were the star of the show. They are perfectly sauced and perfectly cooked and every bite made my mouth water. We also shared a personal size Brooklyn Pizza and Garlic Cheesy Knots that were both bursting with flavor. Overall it was the perfect spot for a casual date night, great food, even better service and a good price. If we are ever in the area again we will visit this location again for sure!"}
{"text":"If you come here, you MUST ORDER garlic knots. Those things are amazingly delicious. We went for lunch and it was super fast, had a group of 4 and everything went smoothly. Our server was super nice and efficient. We ordered the ham/pineapple and it was delicious. I wish there were more of this place around Arizona. We were in and out in half an hour. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this restaurant.  We chose this restaurant because of the good reviews on Yelp, and it totally lived up to the reviews.  Our dinner was amazing.  It started with great service and our waitress Kris.  We ordered the garlic knots, based on reviews, and they were so good.  We followed that with the chicken ceasar and it was hands down one of the best ceasar salads I have ever had.  We had the Brooklyn Family pizza and not a crumb was left.  We wolfed it.  Dessert was zeppolis and they were delicious too.  The manager checked on us several times as well to make sure we were happy with everything, which was a nice touch, and we noticed him doing it with other customers as well.  Our entire experience was positive from beginning to end.  We will definitely be coming back here the next time we are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I has been a while since we've been to NYPD pizza.  We had been running into a soggy crusty, low taste, and quality issues on a repetitive basis, that we really needed to give it time to figure pizza out.  So we had a craving, and we decided to hit NYPD Pizza once again.  We started with some Fried Calamari, which was as good as usual--standard, not excellent, not horrible.  The pizza was excellent.  Perfect cook on the crust (not soggy, not burnt), sauce was very tasty, and excellent cheese:sauce ratio.  It was really good, and the best pizza we had had in Arizona in quite some time.  Thank God!  We had been running into so much bad pizza in Arizona, we were giving up hope.  Hopefully, NYPD will keep up this formula.  We waited 20 minutes for this excellent pizza.  Service was good, bill was as expected.  So bravo NYPD!  We'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Alright so this is my second time here and the first time I was amazed by the service and the food. Everything earned 5 stars!   This second time has been iffy for me because we waited a while before we were seated and waited a longer while for our server to come and ask for our drinks. And the same for our food, but I understand that they could be short on staff or something even though it isn't very busy. Still a great place bumps happen I recommend it here!"}
{"text":"I can not believe that pizza could be this good. I had good pizza on a recent trip to NY, and this really is the closest that I can find to the pizza out there.  They say that its the water, but I am skeptical of that. I guess it doesn't matter what they did to make the pizza, it was really, really good."}
{"text":"Okay I am not a New Yorker nor have I ever been to New York but let me tell you this pizza is soooo good! If ever I was to try actual New York pizza I would imagine this is what it would taste like. I ordered the Joey's Favorite (Vegetarian) pizza and it was as tasty as can be. The dough was perfect and the toppings and cheese were all fresh. I can't wait to go back and try the calzones and hot wings. I highly recommend this place! Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love NYPD Pizza. Their pizza reminds me of being on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village enjoying a slice.   First of all, their pizza is fabulous! Rich sauce, perfectly prepared crust and fresh toppings. Plus, you can fold the slice - like you're supposed to be able to do!  Their service is hands down the best service on Mill Avenue and their beer is ice cold.   It seems like they're either really busy or really slow...I've not seen anything in between. Don't let the empty restaurant fool you. They're good at making pizza and in my opinion, have some of the best pie in Phoenix.   They're further down on Mill, so don't they don't seem to get the southern Mill traffic, but well worth the extra few block walk for lunch or dinner.  Oh, closed Sundays. Good for them!"}
{"text":"I'm from NYC and yes the water makes the difference. The food here is amazing so fresh and delicious. I came for the zeppoli dessert but decided to stay for dinner too. I normally wouldn't bring it up because they fixed it but because of how great they handled it thought I'd share here it goes.... they overcooked the calzone a bit but I never knew the waitress said she noticed it and requested a new one. they did such a good job making sure they replaced the order before I was even notified there was an issue a new one was being made.They also gave me something to snack on until it came. Now that's customer service, that's caring about what you put on the table!! The manager even came by to check on us and make sure everything was going well. He assured us the new calzone was on the way. Fresh salad, yummy food, and attentive staff... AMustGo #yummy And THEY HAVE MILITARY DISCOUNT 5 stars"}
{"text":"This pizza is not very good. I am used to pizza I had back in the NY NJ area. The pizza there is really fantastic and when I came here to Arizona I went to NYPD. I found the pizza to be average to below average. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and 10% off the bill because I work in Surprise. Of course, the food is awesome, too. Adam, from Tenn, is pretty cool behind the counter."}
{"text":"I have been to NYPD a few times now, and have left happy each time.  The restaurant is a bit small, but the layout (with a small bar & a few tables upstairs) is fine if you don't have a large group.  The wait staff is laid back and friendly - attentive but not all over you, which I like.  The garlic knots with cheese are a great way to start a meal - golf ball sized twists of bread topped with melted mozzarella and served with marinara dipping sauce.  The thin crust pizzas are tasty with just the right amounts of cheese and sauce.  On a visit where I ventured away from pizza, I was very impressed by the shells florentine - large pasa shells filled with spinach & artichoke hearts, mixed with oh-so-melty cheese glorious cheese.   Have you noticed yet that I love CHEESE?  :)  Save room for the cookies & cream dessert - a freshly-baked chocolate chip cookie served topped with vanilla ice cream.  Mmmm..."}
{"text":"Clean, comfortable and good service. Good pizza in a nice atmosphere and good location for a bite to eat before and after fun arena event."}
{"text":"Visited this location last night while shopping in the shopping center. We were seated promptly. We ordered beer flight it was good and so was the peach beer. Appetizers bruschetta and artichoke dip both very delicious! Pizza was good ziti sauce not to my liking it was too sweet. Our waitress Danielle was so amazing, so friendly and personable she returned at the exact moments we had needs and was more than willing to remedy the disliking of the ziti. Her personality is great and very funny. I will definitely be requesting her at my next visit! Thanks NYPD for an enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"A few years ago, this place used to be sooooo good. Ordered from here yesterday and ended up with some \"eh\" pizza (hence the 2 stars) and some chicken wings that were dry, hard, overcooked, smelled disgusting and made me sick."}
{"text":"Kids eat free on Wed and now also Sundays with specific adult purchase!   The white pizzas are fantastic!! mmmmmm. The kids get slices (as a kids meal) and the cheese ones are good, too. The seasonal salads have been wonderful--current one I think is called Strawberry Fields? it has nice greens, almond slices, strawberries, apples, cheese, and 2 different dressings.   Got the calzone last night--not recommended. The large (I ordered a small and she made a mistake) was HUGE---large enough for about 5 or 6 people, unless everyone has a huge appetite for a lotta carbs. The dough was uncooked on the inside, and the broccoli and chicken were cold :(.  I guess that process needs some work.  At this particular location, there's always a gal that greets us and keeps calling us \"guys\" in every sentence. It's just a little weird, but the rest of the staff is great.  Again with this place, like at China King, never sure why there doesn't seem to be many people eating in. They do deliver, so maybe lots of ppl have delivery?  They do have patio seating with misters, but right now, kinda hot to eat outside. Probably lovely in the cooler weather.  Kids meals come with a small sundae, so that makes them happy.    The fountain drinks are Pepsi. The diet pepsi tastes bad, and the diet dr pepper doesn't taste much better. They do, however, have filtered water. Your choice of filtered NYC water (tastes great!) or filtered Chandler water.  BTW this location is in the same plaza where Outback, Nordstrom Rack, Famous Footwear, SAS, etc are, so the parking is a little cramped. Not much NYPD can do about that, but it's annoying."}
{"text":"Currently sitting here watching others get there meals before me. I frequent the scottsdale location a lot and the service is always amazing except for today at this arrowhead location. The blonde headed man waiter was so rude. He didn't check up on us... two other groups were getting served faster than we were. He slammed down my drink.  I finally have had enough I'm calling a manager over.  Update* Brittney the manager came over. I asked her if she could find us another waiter and she volunteered her self. She turned this whole evening around for me. Her friendly smile and friendly demeanor just made me feel comfortable again. Our food and drinks came promptly and she was just perfect! If I were to look up excellent customer service, a picture of her would honestly show up next to the definition.  I will be back!  Anyway on to the food! Those deep fried mozz square thing's are delicious. The Bianca is my fave garlic base with ricotta and spinach and mozz The Mott is a close second red sauce and meat! The Pepsi was crispy as all ever! Yum! The fans are made of wooden Pizza boards! Cute! The place is much smaller than its old union hill location but who cares right?  Prices! A large pizza will run you about 20$ and it's huge! No desert costs more than 6.99 The appetizers vary but still great prices!  This is honestly a great place to have a mini b day gathering for the kids or bring your family to.  The bathrooms are clean.  Tables and floors are clean.  Everything is clean.  I will be back. I honestly couldn't take any stars out. The manager was exceptional."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best calzones in the world. The ricotta is amazing and no one does it better. Pizza us awesome and so is this chicken parm. If your from new York come here and be at home."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and live in Colorado and I've been craving good pizza. This is the place! Many options on crust styles and the crust flavor is amazing. Really enjoyed the pizza! The sauce isn't sweet which I like and the staff was so cheerful and helpful.   Thanks NYPD Pizza :)"}
{"text":"I've never actually dined in at this location; however, I order quite often for work lunches and they deliver.  The food is always hot and delicious.  The customer service is always great.  I've tried most of their menu and have never been disappointed.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I'm from nj/nyc so I'm already a snot when it comes to pizza and anything Italian.. We just moved to Glendale from ca.. Which CA has shitty pizza lol.. And we have a restaurant by our old home called NYPD(looks just like the one here).. Anyway we came here for dinner ordered the mozzarella. the kids a small half cheese/pepperoni. we got a small Wall Street. Have to say it's petty tasty I wasn't disappointed... We will be back to try other foods on the menu  Might be our new spot for some yummy pizza"}
{"text":"You want pizza? They've got pizza. I always order the Sicilian pizza from this place - it is the best traditional pizza in Arizona - hands down."}
{"text":"Damn Good Pizza!  I Love a pizza without tomato sauce and NYPD's White Pizza does it right!  Check out these slices of Glory (see pics) One with Tomato and Ricotta and the other with Spinach and Ricotta  They had about 6 or 8 different pizzas to choose from for a slice, not to mention a full menu of signature and custom made pizza, calzone, pasta, soups, salad and appetizers.  The pizza had a  crispy crust with a fluffy interior, not too doughy but just like a perfect french bread, I Loved it!  Great spot for lunch to grab a slice or two and maybe a salad. I would love to try out some of their dinner items as well."}
{"text":"Chicken wings were good, pizza was yummy. Service was good. It was a nice place to hang out and chill."}
{"text":"The pizza is always delicious.  Our waitress, however, was way to busy training to keep up with our party of 3.  Sad. Update.  Actually really horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Excellent service - fun atmosphere. And the pizza is about as close I've had to NY style as I've had outside of NY.  Wish I didn't live 800 miles away."}
{"text":"another pie place that I would be happy to meet you at.  Good service and the trick is to ask that you get thin crust  pizza.  I always go extra sauce light cheese and get toppings.  Not the best but I think it is quite damm good.  hmmm...  getting hungry."}
{"text":"Really great pizza place...  A few good selections of beer and outstanding service ... Sat at the bar and enjoyed Melissa's company and humor..... She made the experience even better."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Nypd. Their pizza is really, but I would definitely ask for it well done so the crust comes a little crispy. Their delivery times are spot on. They save your information and know your past orders so it makes for a pretty easy ordering process.   I'm a pretty decent tipper for a good delivery guy and I really like the guy with the mustache. He's very nice and even brought us a little card for a complimentary appetizer last night as a thank you.   I highly recommend nypd for their food, but the customer service is what pushes them from a four to a five star  review for me."}
{"text":"Great pizzas, salads, chicken parm, garlic knots. I love their white pizza and this is one of those rare places that a simple thin crust cheese pizza is delicious. All their pizza,are great but those are my faves.  Lunch specials are affordable and delicious. Their catering menu is great also. Fresh salads and dressings, hot entrees, sandwich platters, antipasto, cookies, knots... All fresh and delicious. For a family of 6 it is actually cheaper to order chicken parmesan meal from catering menu than to order 6 separate meals."}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I come here.  Excellent pizza with the freshest ingredients.  Highly recommend the garlic knots!  Food is always ready when quoted for take out.  Service is great, very friendly and helpful staff!"}
{"text":"***Update 1/6/16***  Went in today with a co-worker and placed our orders to eat there (that way I could make sure that my order was correct). Food was warm not hot when delivered to the table, not a great sign.....  Although it wasn't hot it still tasted good. When we were almost finished with our meal, I went to the front to place an order to go for a co-worker and the gal who took my order (Claire) wanted my name which I told her what it was but that I just wanted it delivered to my table since it was for a co-worker. She said so you want to eat it here?  I said no it is for a co-worker who is not with us and I told him I would bring him something back. She then said oh ok I'll bring it to you when it is ready so he can eat it here.  Seriously!  No ma'am I need the order TO GO because he isn't with us, I am taking it back to the office for him since that is where he is. Finally the lightbulb went off and she understood.    Order was delivered to our table and I checked to make sure there was ranch for the salad (container wasn't even half full). There was no parmesan or red peppers for the slice of pizza and no napkins or silverware.  So I went up front and asked for these items and some additional ranch for the salad. Needless to say I won't be going back to this location (Raintree and 101) because they need some major training.    ***end of update***  Went in today for the lunch special to go, placed order and then a group of guys came in and placed their orders to eat there. They all ordered lunch specials as well and I'm patiently waiting for my to go orders and these guys started getting their food delivered to their table. I saw what I thought was my order sitting under the heat lamps and nobody is even looking at them. Finally I was asked what I was waiting for and I told them the lunch specials I had ordered 15 minutes ago so they start scrambling to find my orders. Low and behold it was exactly what I thought the order had been sitting there for at least 5 minutes. The styrofoam for the garlic knots was melted and I'm sure the pizza slices were cold. They offered to reheat my slices and I told them no thank you I would like a new order completed so the food would be hot when I got back to the office. No problem they would do that right now. So finally it gets done and I leave and get in my car, the manager rushes out and hands me a card for a free lunch combo which was nice of her to do. I get back to the office and my pizza slice was WRONG. Not happy with the service received and probably won't even go back for the \"free\" special because they will probably make that wrong too. Very disappointed.........  Maybe it is my fault because I didn't check the order before I left, but come on they already had the order completed before so they couldn't double check it?  Wow!"}
{"text":"Best replication if nyc pizza in phoenix hands down.  Greasy, cheesy, tomatoes. Great crust!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great.  One of the better ones I've had. The service  was awesome!"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about NYPD, the reviews are high and I was in the neighborhood.  In the neighborhood is a whole mess of chain restaurants, for some reason I thought NYPD would be different than the rest of Chandler.  Nope.  Sorry, but I can't give this place anywhere near the other 5 star reviews presented below.  I don't want to talk you out of going there, they will feed you, no problem.  The thing is, it ain't all that great.  Maybe they had a good thing going at the beginning but this place is just as plastic as the others.  Everything is satisfactory here, but I really feel they're striving for the mediocre.    The food is good, generic American-Italian.  Pizzas are big and crusty, middle of the road thickness.  The subs are far too bready and the ingredients could be better.  Service was very nice.  I figure this place would be good for lunch, which is super cheap.  Where-o-where in Chandler can a man get some flavor that wasn't shipped in from a lab..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and was surprised to get a great lunch for $8! Since I had never had lunch there (I have ordered take out pizzas for dinner and I knew I liked the pizza!) I am sure I had a perplexed look on my face when the manager asked if I wanted the lunch special. He very patiently and kindly explained how it worked: Order a slice and add either a salad, garlic knots or wings. I chose the mushroom and pepperoni (they will add what you want on a cheese pizza if you don't see what you like on display)  So,,,great salad, slice and a fountain drink for $8!! A much better deal than any sub or chicken place that is for sure!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza here last night.. it was amazing and very authentic too. I have ordered pizza at many places around the valley, and NYPD Pizza is my favorite now!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, salad, and wings for a reasonable price! Service was quick and attentive. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to let everyone know that this NYPD is a wonderful place to go eat at everyone is friendly and happy to be working there. Alyssa took every good care of me she was wonderful keep on doing what you do Alyssa you will be going places in life by helping others!  Thank you to you all!!!"}
{"text":"I had the BEST dining experience here.... not only was the food (we had appetizers, pizza, and salads) really good but our server went above and beyond. He took care of our every need and was so efficient and friendly and just really made our whole night. I will definitely be coming back here again and again!"}
{"text":"I miss this place.  When I used to live in Arizona, my girlfriend and I would eat here really often whenever we were craving wings & their delicious garlic knots!  We usually always ordered their Hell's Kitchen Wings & side of Garlic Knots.   Their wings were always on point! The sauce... mm spicy and full of flavor.. dipping it in ranch to cool down the spiciness a bit.. yum. And their garlic knots!! Such perfection.  So warm and garlic-y.. I am a huge garlic & bread lover so this was always such a pleasure eating.  Sometimes I would eat too much and get really full off of it.. refraining me from enjoying the other stuff we ordered.  I once ordered the Buffalo Caesar Salad but it was nothing special.  Just caesar salad topped with pieces of buffalo chicken.  It didn't really go too well together in my opinion because the buffalo chicken was drenched in its own sauce while being on topped of a bed of salad.. drenched in caesar dressing.  It was really a clash of sauces and too much of it too.  Service is always good, price is decent and the restaurant itself has tons of seating and is very clean!  Anyways, if you come here, stick with their wings & garlic knots! You won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Service is pretty good, but the food is hit and miss.  I love the meatballs and they're consistently good.  But the pizza, you never can tell.  Recently I went in on a Saturday afternoon and asked for a slice of extra cheese & mushroom.  It was like they didn't even try.  It was sad really.  It was so dissapointing I took a picture of it.  Not sure how to upload that picture here though."}
{"text":"First off, the service I received here was fantastic. Attentive, prompt courteous service. Drinks refilled before they were empty etc...  We ordered appetizers, they came out hot and delicious the panko covered mozzarella was a big hit. Their Ranch dressing was delicious. Everything amazing so far at this new location. Well done guys.  Then the pizza came, oh God. This pizza. Clearly this place is running on such tight margins everywhere else that they make up for it by charging heavily for toppings, and then putting 5 or 6 pepperoni on your pizza. The other toppings you ordered you have to play where's Waldo to find them. No way they are hiding under the pepperoni....So, well. Uh...maybes it's under the cheese? No with it being as undercooked as it was the cheese was barely hiding the chewy dough that wasn't cooked enough. Whatever that was. I'd rather have a $7.99 Domino's Take out at least they can cook a pizza properly on their conveyor belt ovens. Unlike this expensive \"Pizza Restaurant\"...  If you go here for an appetizer and few beers you will probably have a great experience. If however you are brave enough to trust the sign on the door and mistake this for a Pizza restaurant...You will be extremely dissatisfied and disappointed with this joke of a \"Pizza Restaurant\". Charging that much for pizza. You should probably run some quality control at the pass before you let sad ass pizza go out and ensure your customers are of the one and done variety.   Should honestly be a 2 star. But the service was really good. So, good luck if you go here. I will send thoughts and prayers to your pizza. It needs them."}
{"text":"Went here and we waited 35 minutes, we ate our appetizer and salad and server told us it would be an additional 25 minutes before our food would be ready who waits over an hour for food? So not sure how the pizza and pasta is but we will not be going back."}
{"text":"I love NY style pizza! NYPD is a great place for an office lunch, grab a couple of slices and a salad. The service at this location is exceptional. The lunch waitress knows what we normally order and is always so friendly. Even on busy night the employees at the takeout counter are really friendly and offer you a free soda while you wait for your takeout pizza."}
{"text":"We found this place from the awesome Yelp! Reviews. It did not disappoint!! From my husband's fried mozzarella to my gluten free spinach artichoke dip, then on to the fabulous gluten free pizza, we left stuffed. We were celebrating our honeymoon in the area and through conversation they found out and gave us an appetizer on the house! If we lived here this would be a go to spot for us! Thank you NYPD! You made us feel so special and full!"}
{"text":"I've never been to this location - previously had only been to the one in Chandler - but I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the west Valley. The food was amazing - I had a bacon calzone that was STUFFED with cheese and then cannolis for desert - and the service was excellent. They say give about 30 minutes for a calzone because they bake it fresh and to-order but I got mine in about 15. The waitress put in the wrong sauce - they ordered a white pizza, got a normal one - so the waitress gave them the messed up pizza and cannolis for free but got the ordered pizza to come out promptly in no time at all. NYPD has the best pizza I could hope for from a chain!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of NYPD. The pizza is always delicious and tastes fresh. My favorites are \"Fran's Favorite\" and the \"Brooklyn Family\". I have no complaints about the pizza. Now, normally my wife and I start our meals with either their garlic knots or tossed antipasto. We're always satisfied with those. Tonight, we decided to try their zucchini sticks and were utterly disappointed, the breading was hard like it had been sitting out for awhile and the cold and soggy inside further confirmed that belief. Not sure if that's how the make them or if it was an off night, but it was definitely far from pleasant. Other than that, pizza was great and the service was superb.  P.S. We have two \"check-ins\" at this particular NYPD, but we also frequent the ones in Goodyear and Gilbert."}
{"text":"Ok I know its a Chain and I try not to review chain restaurants but the deep dish Sicilian here is amazing. Its a great place to go if you want to be stuffed with pizza and leave with your top button open and a smile on your face."}
{"text":"Brooklyn pizza and up-state wings are my jam! Being from NYC this pizza is as good as it gets here. It's one of the best slices in the state and I've tried a bunch. I'll usually get it delivered and still shows up hot and delicious. I've been to this location several times and always great service and ppl. Will continue to visit NYPD!"}
{"text":"I was invited back to NYPD by some higher up I suppose... I was happier this time than with my last couple of experiences there. I was told they were changing things around (managers etc.) I ordered the Sicilian pizza with no toppings and it was delicious and this time in about 20 minutes :)...... All in all this place is good for families and large parties as well as a couple with no kids. I wish they would get rid of Pepsi (I HATE IT), I will be back, was impressed with the service this time!! Thanks for the invite and the food was better!"}
{"text":"So I'm very dissappointed in the service and probably won't be back unfortunately. My mother and I decided to try this locale out, since I haven't since living on this side of town.   Well we waited a couple minutes before anyone approached us to seat us, and then waited an additional minutes before the guy came back to give us menus. I was trying to give the guy the benefit of the doubt considering they seemed to be a lil busy but this was just a series of issues to come.  I ordered the italian beef hero which was actually really good but they didn't provide enough au jus, so i seriously waited forever and a day till the guy decided to come check up on us and see how we were doing. Come to find out he was only waiting on my table and two others (that came in after us), and making coversartion in the back with the employees which was the reason why there was such delay to assist us. When he finally did make it around and I commented the need for more au jus he said he'd be back witha  refill for my mother and my au jus. Well he passed us literally 5X's before he goes, \"OH! The Au Jus\". I mean come on dude where the heck is your head at?! After we were done with our meals, we decided we may attempt to go for some dessert so instead of waiting for him to bring the menu we walked over to the podium and grabbed one our selves. He came by and asked if we'd found something else and I asked him for a refill while we decide.  He again went behind the bar and started convo with another employee and trying to somewhat multi task- and this is where he f'd up. He took my drink and walked over to this senior couples table and put my drink down and went back to converse with the employee AGAIN. I then had to call him out and told him to come over to our table. I told him he just took my drink over to the other table and that I now longer want a refill or dessert, just my bill.   I was really disappointed- I definitely won't be back. To be honest as soon as we sat down I looked up the locale on Yelp and started to see the negative comments and was like, eh I'll give it try, maybe they just happened to hit them on a bad day, but that wasn't the case the service is just bad."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the low marks some people have given. The New York style pizza was delicious and there was nothing wrong with service. I will come back again."}
{"text":"**Update: Manager reached and they are working on making changes, giving an extra start for effort!** ___________________________________________________________  Not sure why this location seems a little lacking compared to its brother over on Camelback and its a bummer since this one is walking distance from our house, but it is..  The staff is average, the atmosphere ok, and the pizza tasty, but just not quite as good.  The parking is also a problem if you do drive, especially during a lunch break.  I hope they can step it up a bit to get back in the NYPD game."}
{"text":"We love NYPD the pizza is awesome! Although we were very disappointed with our waitress this evening. She was slow on filling drinks, asking if we needed anything, when I would ask for things it seemed as if she was annoyed.. Our pasta took 40 min to come out! When I mentioned it taking to long she replied with \"well he gave you some extra pasta so yeah..\" Umm I didn't ask for extra I was just curious why it took so long!! After dropping off our bill she took 20 min to come pick it up! It was SLOW we were her only table. The worst part was we could see her standing in the back talking.. I had to ask other servers who were cleaning to get her for us..smh"}
{"text":"Horrible experience.... Bartender never put my sons spaghetti in and he got it when we were done... 20 mins later!  To top it off I had to go ask for the spaghetti which sat in the window... Here's the catch we were the only customers in the store... No wonder they are slow"}
{"text":"Went during the last PIR race with my wife on a date night.  Worst experience ever.  There were a few loud and rowdy patrons eating the table next to us they were being abnoxious swearing and talking inapprpriately with children within ear shot.  You could tell they have been drinking before they sat down.  The waiter should have asked them to leave but served them alcohol anyways even when they were being inappropriate when he was there he pretty much joined in.    I was going to send an email to there corporate location but the sight does not allow you to.  Surprise surprise.  Horrible definitly do not recommend again."}
{"text":"NYPD Pizza and Nick's were my favorite pizza places when I lived in Scottsdale a few years ago. When I went back recently I ordered some for delivery (they delivered 3 miles away!) and am happy to say the pizza has remained great. Pizza this good is hard to find in other cities unless you are on the East Coast or maybe LA. It's even hard to find good NY style pizza in Chicago. I definitely have never had anything close to this in either the DC area or Kansas City."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I were in the mood for pizza and wings last night so we decided to head over to one of our favorite places for dough and chicken - NYPD Pizza.  We've been there several times so we pretty much knew what we wanted before we even got there. Cheesy garlic knots and honey BBQ wings were a must. But then I ordered a small caesar salad and he ordered a calzone. We've had their pizza before and we both think it's really tasty - good crust.  The garlic knots are SOOO good. Little garlicy dough balls covered in mozzarella cheese and served with a side of marinara. Yummmm-o! Both the knots and the wings came out quickly and were piping hot. The wings are good too, they slather on the tasty sauce.  The boyfriend's calzone came out later (they told us calzone's take a while) and it was ginormous. Seriously, this thing was like a large pizza folded in half. You could easily feed two with that behemoth.  The service at NYPD is always friendly and fast. So while I wouldn't say it's the most remarkable place in town it's a great, dependable place to get flavorful food."}
{"text":"As an East coaster I'm pretty serious about my pizza selection. While visiting my sister in AZ I turned to Yelp (as always) for top picks close by in Chandler.   The 4 star reviews on this place are accurate. We ordered the Da Works pizza and it was SOLID - cooked to perfection and loaded with fresh ingredients artfully balanced. Balance is critical when you go for mass toppings and they nailed it. It's one of those things that's simple in theory but too many places drop the ball on. This joint takes pride in their craft and the outcome doesn't disappoint.   On a side note, we also ordered a Greek salad sans cheese. Unfortunately they forget the pepperocini's so it was a bit underwhelming. THAT SAID, I called and spoke with Michael (one of the managers) to give my feedback real time. He was attentive, concerned and solution oriented. Everything you want when you pay for something that missed the mark. He sincerely apologized, offered a coupon for our next visit in and assured me he'd pass along the feedback to the staff. Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"I have been a regular here for YEARS  and through the years The managers have always gotten to know me and they knew my order... Things like that. Well... I do not know what has happened in the last couple of months but the staff seems to have completely turned over and once AGAIN there is big time inconsistencies with the food and the service. They total is always changing even though my order is the same and prices have not changed, it takes a long time to even place an order on the phone because the staff is not trained, and the pizza is hit and miss. Now, I am FROM New York and have eaten at some of the best and most famous pizza joints in the city. I know how it should be. And it is never good back to back visits. Losing your regulars is a death blow to a neighborhood pizza joint, especially one that is 30% more expensive than their competition. I am done with it. I will just go to the Camelback location on 20 th st. It has been and is always.... Consistently good and since I am working near there again.... Problem solved. I am really sad i used to love this location."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and the pizza and service are always excellent. I've never been let down. So NYPD has earned 5 stars from me!  They've also updated their menu to offer vegan cheese and salad pizzas. Just as yum as their regular pizzas.   Be aware that it takes about 30 minutes to get your pizza. They don't cut corners here. Get some appetizers if you can't wait that long. Salad is a good choice. I personally don't want the cheesy, doughy apps because, well, the pizza is cheesy and doughy. But my dining companion loves those cheesy garlic knots with either marinara sauce or ranch dressing."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Surprise. In fact it is our favorite pizza anywhere. We travel to AZ every winter and this is our first and last place we eat when we come and get ready to leave. We take all our friends who visit and they love this place too. We have never had anything that isn't delicious. Examples are their salads, (my favorite is the Asiago Caesar salad), wings, lasagna,  pizza (best crust and everything is fresh), good beer and great service. Just ask for Courtney (there are 3). The owner and staff are very customer oriented and friendly. They also have take out and delivery."}
{"text":"I walked in and said we were picking up, the bartender said to wait at the bar. We waited for 20 minutes with nobody coming up to us and then finally went up to the checkout counter to ask what's going on with our order and it was ready the whole time. We finally get the food home and the pizza is undercooked so we are now waiting for it to cook more in our own oven. Just sayin. Bad experience."}
{"text":"Not my favorite chain location. While the service was very friendly and courteous the food did not meet my expectations. Everything was overcooked and flavorless, to include the garlic knots. While I do love NYPD pizza, I'm afraid I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I had purchased a Groupon from here and I thought they were great.  I only had the pizza, but it was wonderful.  The people were wonderful too - the Groupon stated \"eat-in\" only, but I was by myself and really just wanted a pizza for take-out.  They accommodated me without question and even gave me a free soda while I waited.  I will definitely be back here for the pizza again and to try other things on the menu"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town and excellent service.  The kids like it a lot,  which helps it quite a bit.  The cheese knots are a must,  and the bruschetta pizza is the best one.  Really addictive."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with my husband and friends. It was moderately busy. We were seated and greeted right away, and our drink orders were taken. The menu is loaded with appetizers, salads, pizzas, pastas and other goodies. The have vegan pizzas and gluten free, which is great! After reviewing the menu I decided on the honey bbq boneless wings. After a little wait our food was brought out. The wings were okay. Nothing spectacular. The honey bbq sauce was good.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive, the restaurant was clean and bright. Overall I will say my experience was good, nothing over the top."}
{"text":"Friendly staff!!! I received my drink right away which I appreciated, because the weather is hot Hot HOT! I received my salad and chicken wings 8 mins after I ordered! The lasagna came 10 mins later. Food was super good! I'm definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery tonight. Pizza was warm but flavorful, the hell wings were weak ( the jalapeño pepper slice was hotter) but the delivery girl was sweet, she knew my son and lives nearby thought of everything we would need-thank you Linh you were great!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was yumtastic. We ordered 2 appetizers. The fried mozzarella cheese & the fried zucchini . The zucchini was your standard , average , fare .. Now the fried mozzarella cheese was life changing !! The cheese was so soft , fresh and  tasty . The outside is fried perfectly crisp but not greasy .  Then came the large cheese pizza , and a bowl of spaghetti  and meatballs . The pizza was phenomenal !! It's one of my new favs  my daughter and bf loved their spaghetti and meatballs . They both raved about the marinara sauce . If your in central Phoenix and looking for some Italian food be sure to check out NYPD  pizza"}
{"text":"The pizza here is seriously the closest to New York style pizza I have ever had . We had a large pepperoni and asked them To \"burn it\" or cook it until it's well done . The pizza came out PERFECT  we also ordered the fried zucchini as an appy, which was also pretty darn tasty. Shout out to our server Alyssa who was friendly, attentive and seriously Provided some of the best customer service we have ever had !!"}
{"text":"I've had the same pizza every time now.  My eyes and belly just love it so! It's the Pizza Blanca and I get it with roma tomatoes and extra mozzarella!    AND, the people working there are just flipping fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    While we were waiting, I noticed two employees tucked away taking 'food tests'.  I appreciate that!    I've been to the one off Camelback & 20th St. and they're a little undesirable... Ima keep coming back to this exact location :-)"}
{"text":"The food at this place is always great whether you dine in or have it delivered. The staff is very friendly and they actually seem to enjoy their jobs. I highly recommend you give this place a try."}
{"text":"The staff was very helpful. Our waitress had obviously been there for awhile and knew what questions to ask to make sure we got what we wanted.  I like my pizza fully cooked and crispy and she even brought it out for me to check before they cut it so they could put it back in if necessary.  Both my and my husband really enjoyed our personal pizzas.  Will go back."}
{"text":"WTF? WTF? WWWWTTTFFF?  I must be on lonely island because this place sucks. I have a theory about pizza. You could take a loaf of wonder bread, a jar of ragu and melt mozzarella cheese on top and usually find yourself pretty pleased. Pizza is just, well....comforting. Cold/Hot you generally can't go wrong.  NYPD is TERRIBLE! Pizza does not have to be New York style to be good these days. Although being from Brooklyn the Pizza in New York can't be beat. It is my favorite. I wish they would take the NY out of there name because this place is PURE AND UTTER GARBAGE!!!"}
{"text":"I FUCKING LOVE PIZZA! The end.  I try things over and over, sometimes when they suck too. Same is the case here. I keep trying this pizza and eveytime I just don't like it. I don't know what it is.   Sauce = Bland  Crust = Bland and did not pass the NY fold test, full on Tip Drip!!  Truly they're better places than this in AZ. I don't want to mention them in this article but 3 or 4 come to mind.    P.S. This time when I tried the pizza I was swimming laps outside.....in the heat..... That makes me soooo hungry. Our friends ordered it and thats why I had it again. As hungry as I was I still no likey!!!"}
{"text":"If you just want a slice or you need a whole pie, you can get what you want at NYPD.  Do you really think this is going the be the best pizza?  Um No but it is better than the crap you order from Papa John's, Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Pappy Murphy's.  Just eat the damn tasty pie and shut up.  It is pizza and I like it!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and not only did they accommodate me by going slightly out of their usual delivery zone, but the pizza arrived way before the promised delivery time. Both the pizza and hot wings were very good. The pizza had just the right amount of sauce, toppings, cheese ratio. And the wings had a pleasant amount of heat and good flavor. I also especially love the unique pizza crust. Will order from them again the next time we want pizza!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza; decent prices, especially if you just want an individual pizza.  For vegetarians, the salads are beautiful--an artful blend of fresh greens, cheeses, fruit, and nuts.  The \"Joey's Favorite\" pizza is the perfect veggie pizza with lots of fresh greens, mozzarella, and marinara--not fancy, just fresh.  Portion sizes are large, so plan to ask for a box.    The service has always been excellent and one time the manager brought our table an order of garlic knots just as a thank you!    They have a good beer selection, but I always go for the Uptown Amber Ale which is brewed locally in Phoenix and exclusive to NYPD restaurants.  Take it from a NY-expat, this place is good pizza at a good value!"}
{"text":"NYPD does it right. Pizza, that is. I haven't actually tried any of their other food because the pizza is so freakin good. PERFECT doughy crust just crisp enough on the outside and soft on the inside, flavorful tomato sauce, and the ratio of cheese to sauce is spot on. When my parents visit from NY and want pizza that is like home, we go here.   Like the other reviewer said, the Pizza Blanco is to die for...big gooey chunks of ricotta and fresh roma tomatoes (or spinach) and an s-load of garlic.   I dine in and get takeout from here pretty regularly, and I think the pizza is slightly better as takeout because it has more time to rest. When you can get it home you can fold that sweet slice in half and dig in. It is nice to have a fresh from the oven pizza in the restaurant, but if the cheese is not set up at least a little, you can have kind of a messy slice that requires a fork. As far as pizza goes in this neighborhood, NYPD (and occasionally AJ's by the slice) is the only way to go."}
{"text":"Got some take out from here the other night place was good. Got just a plain cheese pizza and wings. Everything was just good not amazing or great or awesome just good. Worth a try I probably would not go back.  that's a big name to live up to so I was expecting something a little better then what I got."}
{"text":"Visited NYPD for the first time in a long time.  It was delicious.  I have often felt and said that I can determine the quality of the entire menu of an Italian restaurant by a thimble full of red sauce (or as the Italian's say, \"gravy\").  It doesn't even matter what I ordered tonite, the food was so fresh, so delicious and the red sauce was fantastic.  My only complaint is the prices.  A large 3 topping pizza is $25.  Maybe it's me.  Maybe it's the cost of quality, fresh food.  I can tell you this: it's fresh and it's good."}
{"text":"NYPD Pizza was good the first two times I went there but the last 4 times since then I have left unsatisfied. Yesterday, I got a meatball and parm sandwich. The sandwich was tiny!!! It was also tasteless and had two little dots of sauce on it. My wife and I were laughing as we could not figure out how they took marinara sauce and put two very small dots on the sandwich. It was like they tattooed the bread with a small amount of sauce. Is your marinara priceless or something or do you just not give a crap about the quality of the food. My wife got the Italian cold cut which was a bigger sandwich but very, very plain. It was like someone slapped it together in two seconds. I could have made the same sandwich at home with no effort. The last 4 times we have been burned and I have said \"we are not going back\" but because it was so easy to go because it is close by, I thought, well maybe it will get better. It hasn't and we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with the lady friend and to be honest, I didn't have very high expectations for the place. She is an NYPD regular and ordered up a gluten-free pizza, gluten-free SoHo pizza salad and the chopped salad. Everything was DEE-LISH. Love the fact that they have the gluten free options and the food is incredible. The service was great as well.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Again, super impressed. Wish i would have got a photo of my pizza and hubbys GIGANTIC calzone. Seriously, you can't really understand the size of this thing. Went on kids night, not terribly busy, I like that the kids can exchange another slice of pizza instead of having dessert. Our server wasn't the best- maybe a little too much socializing at the server station... but the food was delicious, hot, fresh and plenty of it. On kids night and we had a m'za pizza blanca, a large pepperoni calzone and 2 giant slices for EACH kid and the bill was $18.03!!!! Hands down my favorite new york style pizza place in AZ."}
{"text":"They have a great lunch special with a slice of pizza and a salad for a reasonable price and it's definitely filling. I've also had great service every time I've been."}
{"text":"I wish they had a location closer to me! I've always done the take out but now I guess they deliver too! The pizza is crisp and has the perfect amount of cheese. I like that they have updated their website. They have a 10\" pizza which is great for a night in alone. Prices are spot on. Staff friendly."}
{"text":"Just so-so for me. Came here with a Groupon.   Garlic knots weren't great. Sort of doughy. And not enough dipping sauce to go around. An assortment would have been nice. Wings were ordinary.   Our food took forever, which was strange, because my daughter and I split a salad and my other child got Mac and cheese. We waited soooo long. Our poor server didn't even know what was going on.   The Antipasto salad was okay. There were only like 6 pieces of salami. I had to salt it which is out of the ordinary for me. It was swimming in olive oil and balsamic. The bottom was like soup. Get the dressing on the side!   Overall a so-so experience. Next time I'll try a pizza. I do have to use my other groupon."}
{"text":"WOWSA- we just moved here from NYC and this pizza is like home :)  We tried the Brooklyn and Da Works  pies and the Brooklyn was WAY BETTER. I didn't like the Da Works (don't care for fresh tomatoes on top of my pizza).    This will be our regular pizza joint for the area- we were both impressed and will order many more Brooklyn pizzas from NYPD! Having just moved from NYC we can speak with authority when we say \"It's authentic NY pizza!\""}
{"text":"I would honestly give this place more than five stars. I've been in here about once or twice a week and I love it so much. The staff is so welcoming and friendly and it makes me want to keep coming back. Their food is incredible but the atmosphere and energy makes it even more delicious for me. I don't know if the staff reads this but if they do shoutout to David and Cody"}
{"text":"I have a pizza problem. I like pizza and i like it lots of ways. this is the only place the gets it the New York way. That fold is so perfect. I've tried so many things here to list em all. If it's pizza you can get it. I dont go to a pizza place for anything else. The wings are good had the pasta once but the pizza has my love."}
{"text":"We had a few problems here and my fiancé emailed corporate and they sent us a gift certificate to give them another try. I'm glad they did because it's become one of my favorites. Monday has become pizza night because we love the but one get one half price special."}
{"text":"If you need a gluten free pizza this is the place to go.The gluten crust was crisp,the pizza sauce was very tasty.I would highly recommend this restaurant.The price is right,the service is good."}
{"text":"This is a tough one anti pasta salad was fair at best! Calzone is Hugh but was cold in center after 30 min wait. Service was not there; waiter walked by us so many times that I lost count and I still needed a refill. It wasn't him that got the refills for us. Not bad food not the best, it's the service that really hurts here!! Maybe some one would want to work a split shift. Just not a good experience. I love to tip good service this was zero service and only will return if someone just has to visit! I've been here probably five times and service has always been a notable issue! Waiter paid a ton of attention to a couple sitting at the bar! Probably not their desired outcome for our visit but it is that. I did speak with a manager and addressed my observations and concerns! Good luck give it a shot!!"}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings. One visit was great, and another visit was abysmal. The lunch buffet was really bad, but the freshly ordered pizza was one of the best I have ever had. The timing was even respectable, which is amazing for a pizza place."}
{"text":"I was going to give five until I tasted my friends eggplant parm, not what I would expect. The sauce was bland... But that aside, the pizza here brought me back to the East coast, same crust, they even bring in the water to make the dough. This is the pizza I know and love, bend in half and shove into mouth, trying not to burn off the skin on the roof of your mouth. I highly recommend this place to every one. Oh, and I tried their signature beer and that rocked as well."}
{"text":"I felt compelled to update my review today.  This is the third time I've been here.  Dined in once, ordered delivery once and picked up today.  My previous review was based on my first experience.    When I ordered delivery I was told it would take 75 mins for delivery but it ended up taking 2 hours and the pizza was cold when I got it.  The manager, Mike, mailed me a coupon for a free pizza and then once my pizza was delivered he called to make sure I did in fact receive my pizza.  I told him I did but it was cold so he offered to bring me another one rushed but I declined.  The pizza tasted damn good (Blanca pizza) so I was okay.    Today I ordered the Margherita pizza using my free coupon.  The pickup area employees were very nice and the pizza was delicious.  It wasn't hot (even though I came 5 mins before the time they told me) but I was so hungry I didn't care.  The taste made up for the lack of hotness.    I still don't think this is the best pizza around but it's hard to compare them with Phoenix's finest like Cibo and Federal.  If you want delivery or pickup, this is definitely the best around and a helluva lot better than Pizza Slut or Crappa Johns.    Their white pizza and margherita pizzas are fabulous and they have earned my business so I have now added them as a contact in my phone.  They should feel special."}
{"text":"Chain or not I really like the pizza here.  The ricotta is great so the calzones are awesome too.  Also, the spinach artichoke dip is stellar.    That said, order take out.  Don't try to go eat at this location.  The service and management the times I've been are bad.  Not like, they forgot to put the dressing on the side bad.  Like, I'm going to go fight the manager bad.  I've seen people screaming at a manager.  I've seen people walk out.  I've seen people give up the will to live.  I guess when you have a 19 year old manager, this happens.  You'd figure the ownership would get fed up with watching thousands of dollars walk out the door weekly due to incompetent hosting/managing but whatever.  Order take out, add 10 minutes to the time they give you and you'll be ok with the result!"}
{"text":"Must have whenever I'm back in town...Spinach Dip is the shiznit Pizzas are bombdigity and the service is pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"Easily the best pizza we've ever had. The crust is made with their special \"New York\" water. Not sure what makes that H2O so special, but that crust is to die for. The sauce is fresh and not overburdened with spices - tastes light and fresh. The bruschetta was a mound of perfection as well - beautifully presented. The feta on my Greek salad tasted nothing like we get at home - absolutely delish! The 8\" pizza is a perfect size for one. NYPD Pizza goes to the top of our favorite's list."}
{"text":"I was there towards the end of lunch and got a fresh slice since they didn't have any pies sitting out. Got them to go and was super excited to get home and try the pizza. I was starving so I scarfed the first down without really thinking. When I got to the second however, I realized the dough was under cooked. Not severely, but enough to taste it. Other than that the pizza was pretty dang good and I do plan on trying them again, hopefully then I'll be able to update my review to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Want to start of by saying Kayla was an excellent server. She was very sweet and attentive without being overbearing. Really made it that much better of an experience. :)  Besides that, the food was excellent! I had a not-so excellent experience at another location, but opted to give the one a little closer to my house a try and was not at all disappointed. The garlic cheese knots were crispy and flully and prefectly cheesed and garliced. The fried mozzarella was excellent, especially dipped in the basalmic it was served with. My boyfriend raved about their superiority over mozzarella sticks the entire meal. And finally, the pizza was delicious. Went for the Buffalo Chicken, it had the right amount of spice and cheese and the celery added a wonderful crunch and sweetness. The crust was perfectly crunchy and chewy, I loved it. We will definitely be returning when we get cravings for pizza."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and the food was delicious . The Waite staff was very courteous and attentive . The rest room  was clean and well lite. The prices were very affordable."}
{"text":"Recently, we had placed an order for a fairly large. The delivery itself took a lot longer than expected, the food was cold and we were missing a soda. Coming from a family business, we do understand that sometimes it gets busy. I did feel the need to express my frustrations to management at NYPD, so I called shortly after we received our food and asked to speak with a manager. I spoke with the manager Tyler who apologized for the late delivery. He completely turned the situation around and offered to completely refund our order. I was pleased with with how he handled the situation and felt like we were being taken care of.  In fact, I'm ordering pizza from them tonight!"}
{"text":"Visited for lunch today after several months (been dieting) and the food was excellent and the service received from Tawnya was even better! Definitely will come back here and request to sit with Tawnya."}
{"text":"Pros : Great Pizza, food, Service, and Atmoshphere  Cons: Pricey with no combo of pizza & wings specials   You can tell their management team is very expirienced.  well deserved 4 stars and worth a try."}
{"text":"So... It is really good, I would not say it is JUST LIKE NY pizza, however it is good. Guy at the counter was nice and was greeted at the door. A little customer service goes a long way. :)"}
{"text":"Place just isn't on top of it as it was in the early days. Just ordered for delivery and they claimed 45 minutes and it was an hour and 15. I live about 3.0 miles from the store. Dude didn't say anything about it being late. They forgot my blue cheese for my wings and the pizza has very little sauce and is undercooked. Again, this place used to be can't miss, but the last couple of years has just lost their mojo. For $20+ for a pie it's time to go to Grimaldis for better quality and consistency."}
{"text":"They have vegan Daiya cheese on their Veganizza pizza and you can order vegan garlic knots with Daiya cheese also (but without the butter garlic spread). Good quality and delicious classic pizza spot (that happens to have some vegan options). Fresh pizza toppings and good sauce. Always great service. Fun date spot. If they had a vegan dessert option this place would be a perfect vegan indulgence."}
{"text":"We were having a conversation with a local pizza maker a few months ago about the varying opinions about what constitutes \"good\" pizza. He shared with us that one of the most common opening remarks he receives from customers is: \"I'm from New York . . . \"    Okay? And?  I guess it gives people a sense of credibility and a perceived \"edge\" over others, who lack the credentials to judge what's good vs bad when it comes to this style of pie. Given that I've never visited New York and will unlikely be going anytime soon, I'm not entirely sure what the keys are to doing the pizza right. I've just always associated it with big, floppy slices of pizza that are foldable and contain dough that's extremely high in gluten. The quality, more or less, lies within the skill of the maker and the quality of the ingredients used.    Some say that NY crust has a distinct flavor, which is largely attributed to the minerals found in the city water. Hell, I've heard that some owners even go so far as to physically import water from New York in order to duplicate this. That's what I call hardcore dedication! Apparently, NYPD uses a specialized water filtration system that allegedly gives it the minerals required to emulate the \"New York taste\" in its crust. Whether or not it works, I wouldn't know - but it's definitely a clever little approach and a great marketing tool if anything else.   As for their pizza, I actually don't think it's too bad in comparison to other chain-level options. Before the wood-fired and fast casual concepts consumed the city, I used to pick up pizzas quite regularly here. The crust does have somewhat of a distinct flavor and the ingredients are a notch above what you would find at many other places. In fact, I remember one instance when I went to pick up a pizza, the girl opened the box and deemed the pizza unacceptable for being just slightly overcooked. Although I said it was fine, she insisted that they make another one properly. It's nice to see some quality control in place.    Is it the best pizza you'll ever eat? Probably not. Nor is it a place that I'd ever make it a point to visit for a Saturday night dinner. But in terms of the convenience and a quick pizza fix, I feel that they do their job just fine.  Unfortunately, I'm from Phoenix, so my opinion on New York pizza holds little value."}
{"text":"Went to NYPD today and food was ever so perfect. We had picked up our food without waiting, the staff had our ready for us. I will recommend this to my friends and family. Thanks NYPD for making our night enjoyable!"}
{"text":"We were in town for a couple of nights and we ordered take out on our 2nd night (I wish we would of came the first night too).  I'm not a pizza person, so I opted for the Soho Pizza Salad that was sooo delicious - thanks to the gal that told me how to eat it!  =)   My boys had the Mott Street Meat Lover's Pizza and they said it was all good.  When we came in to pick up, the restaurant seemed to be family orientated and friendly.  I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"The soho salad is awesome and pizza is great. It's priced a bit higher than most pizza places (minus 1 star), but we continue to go because it is so much better than others. I think I could eat the soho salad every day!"}
{"text":"The pizza was very oily. I think it was due to the quality of ingredients. The crust was good. My date order the chicken parmesan and he liked it. I thought the spaghetti that came with it look very cafeteria style. Our waitress was very apathetic. Overall it was just OK. I can't say I dislike this place, but I definitely don't like it either. They're open until 10PM which is nice."}
{"text":"Love the fried mozarella! I could not get enough. The pizzas are just perfect to share as well. Fun place always busy but the service is great."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok.. I ordered Vinnies, which is your choice of 5 toppings.  Italian sausage, black olives, onions, garlic and basil.  It wasn't bad - but it wasn't great either.    The server was exceptionally friendly and helpful - but the service was the high point of the experience."}
{"text":"Just had an ice cold pizza delivered to my door. What the pie lacked in temperature it also lacked in sauce, flavor and cooked toppings. The onion on it was raw. The wings we ordered were also cold and the cannoli just sadly drenched with Hershey's syrup and kisses on top. NYPD clearly doesn't care about their product. Won't return."}
{"text":"WOW!!  Can I just say the customer service is second to none!!  Thank YOU Nicole!  Not only were you extremely efficient in taking our order for delivery but everything was PERFECT, thank you so much!  NYPD needed you to bring customer service back. Way to go Nicole. Many times the negative is brought to light and the POSITIVE goes unsaid...  YOU deserve a great Pat on the back, job more than well done!  Our food was perfect even with the extras and the minus', on time, actually early and hot!  Greatly appreciated.  More business headed your way!  Enjoy your week knowing you went 'above & beyond' Thank you Dawn O"}
{"text":"The absolute best pizza in America. I always order the extra large cheese, and I have leftovers for a week. The ranch dip for the pie is the best in town, and the crust is perfection.  I wrote a short poem for NYPD in hopes of getting free food, here it is.   NYPD,  The place I always want to be I cannot live without that pie And if it didn't exist, I would want to die.   The ranch, the salad, heck even the garlic knot. Everything is made with love, But wait just a few minutes, the food is hot.  And if you don't like grease, you should bring a glove.   One dollar sign, two or even three, This is the place God made just for me.   If you can't tell already I love NYPD, and it kills me not to eat there more often. Keep up all the great work, and I will surely be coming back."}
{"text":"Some of the better pizza I've had. Top 5 for sure. It's a little slow but good priced and worth.  They have some amazing garlic bread ball things you can get before the mean (or anytime I guess) and one time they hooked us up with some free dessert because the food took so long to come out.  So here is the just of it - they had some service issues, but the food and how they tried to take care of us made up for it!  Will (and have gone back) to this place again!"}
{"text":"The white pizza with breaded eggplant added is amazing.  Lunch deals are wonderful too.  Always a fun place to go."}
{"text":"Never again!  This is the third time I tried, each time trying a different pizza.  Today I had a small pizza, the middle was so loaded with sauce and the dough was a little under cooked that the entire middle fell off and was a ball of goo.  The wings were mushy.  The last time it happened the manager said he would send me a gift card. Never did.  Then I thought maybe it was because I had it delivered, so I went in and ordered.  It was like the guy at the counter had been smoking something.  Placed my order, walked to my car, came back in and he could not find my order and asked if I called it in.  I should note, there were two people in the restaurant.  Better step it up NYPD, there are a lot of choices in Chandler."}
{"text":"It's definitely more expensive than a typical chain pizza spot, but it's well worth the price.  Everything I've had here has been great.  It does hold true to its name as a New York style restaurant, having been to NY several times it's the closest I've found in AZ.  We do takeout from here roughly once a week and have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Been here before and this last time will be my last. Waited 30 mins for the wrong order. Then waited another 20 mins for my ordered pizza to be cold. I will never go back !!"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about the restaurant.  Some items are good, but the pizzas are extremely greasy.  Service is very polite and punctual, but it feels as though the service isn't even required because of the Chandler restaurant's layout.  I was not impressed with this pizza, but have not tried other offerings."}
{"text":"Came in to have some pizza while waiting for a car service to be done across the parking lot. The restaurant was not busy in any way but instead of seating me, I was asked to go up front and order then sit anywhere I would like.  When the cashier finally got done looking at something her co worker thought was funny, I placed my order then sat down across the way so they could see where I sat.  While waiting for my order the same cashier came up to me asking what I was doing in the restaurant sitting at a table. I told her \"I ordered a pizza from you a few minutes ago and waiting to eat it here\".  Eventually it was brought out to me in a \"to go\" box, not served in a way as if I would be dining in.  I told them that it would be fine, I was too hungry and bothered to ask them for anything else.  After I started to eat my food, they decided to sit down a small family with a few young/loud children at the table two feet away from me.  Again, it was not busy, they had the entire restaurant to seat them that did not have to be right next to someone else already upset with them. Wait, how did they even get seated? When I walked in they wouldn't seat me!!  So needless to say, major fail and will choose somewhere else next time I am near that location."}
{"text":"I came here after having a bad experience at one of their other locations.  What a world of difference, this place was great. From the moment I called in my order, to leaving their establishment, I have nothing to say but great service and great food.  The manager was extremely friendly and concerned about my experience as well as Molly who worked the counter that night could not have been more friendlier and caring.  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is excellent. Good quality ingredients, well made crust and sauces. I enjoy Vinny's Favorite pizza, because I can choose any five toppings I want and can change it up at anytime. The service can be hit or miss. I have had great experiences and not so great experiences, but overall I recommend you give them a try."}
{"text":"I love calzones and haven't had a good one in quite some time. This was my first time at NYPD and it's definitely top 2 if not 1 best calzone I've had. Most places put tons of mozzarella and hardly any ricotta, but they got it just right! Only bad thing is the location. It's kind of tucked away, but so glad I found it! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here I was pretty impressed so I decided to try it again but this time I got delivery. The pizza arrived in about an hour and when I got it, it was barely warm. I would expect the pizza to be hot as I only live a mile away from this place. Also I don't really like the fact that you have to spend $15 to get delivery. Therefore, I ended up spending $20 on a cold pizza and a salad that I didn't really need. A pretty big bummer for me. The pizza was also undercooked. The crust was still dough on one of the slices.   I only ordered from here because Pino's is closed on Sundays. I may eat in-house here but will definitely not get delivery from here again."}
{"text":"Love this place. We go quite often as an office and always sit in Liz's area. She is fantastic. She knows our usuals and is very friendly. She never lets our drinks get empty and is fun to talk to. Look her up next time you're in"}
{"text":"Garlic knots, pizza, cheesecake and child entertainment?!? Yes please! Great food. Very nice staff. Most importantly,..they hand out paper plates and crayons to the kids. I don't know why this keeps kids busier than a coloring page. But it does. My four year old looks at these paper plates with amazement in her eyes. Like she has a score to settle. Is it because paper plates are foreign to our household? Maybe. All that matters is she  quietly concentrates while carefully coloring every piece of her paper plate. Who would have thought! Peace and quite the entire time it took to receive our food.  Then the waitress hung her paper plate picture on the wall among various other plates colored by children whose parent undoubtedly love this restaurant as well. What a great idea.  Oh yeah, the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Consistently good pizza, wings, and salads.   Great lunch combos, and decently fast. We like to come in for a quick lunch from work. Whether you're in the mood for wings, pizza, or salad you covered for an express lunch. It really seems like they value your time, and get you on your way in an acceptable amount of time."}
{"text":"Ordered two pizzas for our office: one full pizza with sausage, peppers, onions, pepperoni and olives and the other was a medium veggie pizza.  The food not that great; it tasted like the pizza had been sitting in the car for a while. The sauce tasted bland and the crust was not crispy at all.  I felt like the pizza was frozen and re-heated up again. Also, it seemed like the vegetables were overcooked.  I do not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Never again. Pizza was nothing special like other times. Wings were screwed up, dry and cold. Ordered extra ranch and some of them barely had any ranch in them. Thanks for the laugh!!"}
{"text":"We love NYPD. My girlfriend thinks they have the best gluten free pizza and I love their eggplant parmigiana sandwich. The other night I picked up our regular order and when I got home we discovered that there was an error in the usual pizza toppings. After dinner we called NYPD to let them know. Without batting an eyelash the NYPD staff person apologized and said they wanted to send us a coupon for a free pizza the next time we ordered from them. In a couple of days a $20 gift certificate came in the mail. WOW!!! Talk about great customer service. Thanks NYPD!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The people working there were always nice and the pizza is just plain good.  Sometimes slightly salty, depending on which toppings you go for, but in general a good crust, good toppings, nicely cooked and pleasantly presented.  At some point we became fans of the white pizza.  This one has no sauce on it, though they do toss on some spinich or tomatoes for color-- it's a toss up, I like it both ways.  This is not to say that their more traditional sauce-laden pizza isn't a fine choice as well.  And for those who have ever had a calzone from \"back east,\" we figured we would ask them if they could take their normal calzone and deep fry it, just like at Pizza Town, USA in my old home town of New Milford, NJ.  They were good enough to oblige us, but things went awry quickly.  Our theory was that the cook tried to bake the calzone before frying it, so we ended up with an oily glob-- kudos to them, though, for giving it a try.  When I go back to visit in Phoenix a stop at NYPD is always on the agenda."}
{"text":"I have been eating at NYPD for some time and it is always great.  The Food is wonderful and the staff is amazing.  For some time now a young man named Adem has been my server and is wonderful.  I eat most of my meals out and I can tell you he is the best.  Adem knows the menu inside and out so he can help with offering up vegetarian or Vegan items.  He greets you as you enter and is so fast at assisting you with a drink and a menu.  He checks back often and is so attentive that he knows just the right time to bring over the check.  Adem is a huge asset to NYPD.  I wanted to make sure someone knows how great he is.  I managed domestic and international customer service for a large international company for 37 years and have now retired.  If I was still working I would steal Adem away as his skills would be valued at any company.  Thanks Adem for always being the best....Ray"}
{"text":"I wanted to give an employee at the Dysart location a commendation for outstanding service.    Sometimes you will get an employee that goes way above expectations and stands out giving exceptional service.  That was Dominic.   When I first came into the restaurant I was quickly greeted by Dominic and I could tell he liked his job.  I sat outside as I had my dog with me and Dominic immediately brought my dog a bowl of water.  Due to  my work and traveling before retiring, most of my meals were in restaurants.  Dominic stood out as a memorable restaurant experience.  He was personable, efficient and I could tell he was dedicated to his job and the customer.  I spent 37 years managing worldwide customer service for a large corporation and Dominic stood out.  I just wanted to make sure someone knew I appreciated his ability to make a quick stop for pizza a great experience.  Also, a thanks to Josh for his help when I called in this morning.  I recognized the voice and realized I knew him from another location.  Thanks Dominic and Josh..."}
{"text":"Great food!!!  Good lunch specials."}
{"text":"Like the cleanliness and the service. I visited the NYPD on Union Hills, Never again. Service mediocre and not as inviting. Friends and I have returned to the 7th Ave location for three consecutive Fridays and never disappointed."}
{"text":"Best chain pizza in the 85295/85297 zip code. New York style thin crust pizza, perfectly blended cheeses, awesome toppings. And they now deliver. It's a little on the pricey side (expect to pay upwards of $25 for a large specialty pizza) but it's worth every nickel. I recommend the Brooklyn Family (pepperoni, sausage, fresh basil) with garlic knots and their upstate wings. Add in some ice cold beer and you've got yourself a real meal. Delivery time is typically 45-60 minutes on a weekday and longer on the weekends (especially when a big game is on).  The restaurant is rather small, seating maybe 50-60 people. They do have a bar with several beers on tap. Expect longer wait times during the weekends. Service is decent, but not great. The couple times my wife and I went the orders were mixed up but the manager helped a little by giving us some free food (this should happen any time there are issues with an order IMHO).  Overall highly recommended. Treat yourself to NYPD pizza, you won't regret it.  UPDATED March 2012: The Gilbert location (San Tan) has really taken a few steps backward for this pizza chain. The delivery is pretty much guaranteed to arrive COLD, and the product itself seems to have declined overall. Unfortunately, I wonder if NYPD grew too fast for its own good? Overall I'm changing the score from 5 to 3 stars- as the pizza is just OK now when compared to alternative options. Last time the wife and I sat down inside the service was horrid- taking nearly 20 minutes to get the beers we ordered after getting our table. Even the pizza was served luke warm at the restaurant, which is amazing since it's a 20 second walk from the oven to table. Oh well, it was good while it lasted I suppose."}
{"text":"The absolute worst service! I am so dissapointed! Our waitress was Kayla and we waited for 30 minutes after we had ordered before she came back to the table. We had waited almost 50 minutes, finally asked when the food would be done, Kayla then tells us that  the kitchen didn't have something to make one of the dishes... would have been nice to know this because we could have changed the order! She was talking to a co-worker and pointing and proceeded to do that the entire time we were there. She gave us attitude tgen when she handed us the check, then she was nice! So dissatisfied!"}
{"text":"With no doubt, our family's go-to pizza joint. Perfect amount of sauce: topping ratio, crust is crunchy outside and soft and chewy inside. Service is always great and we've never had and issue. My only complaint is they don't deliver to my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ugh guilty pleasure at work! I love when we order pizza from NYPD. The Vegan pizza is delicious, but my ultimate favorite it the BBQ Chicken pizza."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is horrible! We were sat pretty quickly and order was taken in a timely manner. After that, it went downhill pretty quick. Each thing we ordered came out at different times.. side salad was brought out after appetizers and wings, the pizza followed 10 minutes later. Had to wait a while for a water refill. Waited forever to get a few boxes and the check. Kept looking around for the waitress, one time saw her eating a bite of salad at the counter. We  didnt even get a \"how is your meal going? Do you need anything\" each time I asked for something I had to ask as our waitress passed the table. Probably spent more time waiting around for the waitress then actually eating."}
{"text":"I recommend:   Spinach Artichoke dip Wall Street with mushrooms Pizza Blanca with spinach Brooklyn Family (always a hit if you have a group who can't decide)  We've ordered from NYPD for family parties. We've eaten in. Just yesterday I snagged their lunch special of a slice and a small salad (Caesar with anchovies... yes anchovies). Everything is always a solid four stars.   Consistency FTW."}
{"text":"We have chosen to come to this location rather than the location five minutes from our house due to what we perceived as better service from a couple of other visits. Looks like we were wrong and that's disappointing. Given that there are no shortage of other pizza places around to get our business, it looks as though NYPD will be stricken from our list.  Choosing to come in on a slow Monday night, we were told they didn't have any knots because they ran out and were making more. No worries there... except when they finally did show up, they had been sitting under the warmer for no shorter than 10 minutes instead of being brought to us when they were available. Why is that? It wasn't busy and they server walked past them at least five times. We were seated in front of the kitchen so it wasn't hard to see.   My wife ordered a salad. Easy peasy. I ordered a personal pizza which, like the knots, has been sitting under the warmer for more than 10 minutes plus while I've typed all this from my phone and have been watching the whole time. When it finally came, it didn't look all that great and it wasn't all that hot. Oh, and it's soggy in the middle to boot. How wonderful.  If management reads their reviews, I sure hope that this is taken seriously and acted upon promptly. I wouldn't mind a contact from a member of your team. Don't get me wrong here as it likely wasn't all on our server who was nice enough but not as attentive as I guess I expected seeing how slow it was in the restaurant. I also didn't want to delay our exit by waiting to speak to the MOD."}
{"text":"Okay, so before I even get into how awesome the food is, I really have to stress how great of service I experienced from our server, Keith. Honestly, truly. From the moment my husband and I got sat at our table outside (and we were the only ones outside), Keith was super attentive to our needs. The service was quick, and not once did he forget about us or let our drinks ever get empty. He was very kind, and has a great personality. We really didn't even need to ask for much because he was already on top of it! It was just a plus that our food came out to us hot and fresh. I really do wish I could give Keith and this restaurant 10 stars because everyone we interacted with provided exceptional customer service. Thank you NYPD and Keith!!"}
{"text":"Paging: Members of the Gluten Free Society.  The Soho Pizza Salad on a Gluten Free crust is crazy good. They have a rice based sweet gluten free crust here... You can get a regular pizza or have them throw the Soho Salad on top.   You are welcome."}
{"text":"A fave pizza place in the valley.  The whole family loves it!  I prefer to dine in as when we've had it delivered its never been hot enough.  But it sure is yummy!  The cheese is my faaaaaave!"}
{"text":"Delicious special veggie pizza and draft beer. Excellent service. Nerd friendly: electrical outlets at all the tables."}
{"text":"I enjoy ordering from NYPD on a Monday or Tuesday night when the second pizza is half price. I order probably 2-3 times per month as the family enjoys getting together and chatting over a good meal with little clean up. Our deliveries always arrive earlier than the time quoted! The delivery drivers are polite and professional. The toppings have been correct all but one time and it has been so long since the foul up I can't honestly remember what was wrong. My husban and I are from NY and we love thier pizza. We used to be die hard Ray's fans, not anymore. Our favorites: plain cheese with extra cheese, pepperoni, sliced meatball (yum!) and ham with pineapple. We will continue to order on Monday/Tuesday for the cheap leftovers! Thanks NYPD!!"}
{"text":"People with allergies beware.... My family used to come in to eat a lot. They had such great pizza. But there was one visit that disgusted us so much that we haven't been back since.  My dad is allergic to parsley. Whenever my dad orders something, he always asks of the food has parsley in it since he could be sent to the hospital. Our waitress that time had complete disregard for it. When asked, she didn't even look at the ingredients;  she said there wasn't parsley. She didn't even write it down just to be safe. So when we got the pizza, guess what was on it??? Parsley. We had a talk with the manager and he checked the ingredients list and there was in fact parsley listed.  They need to be safer with people's allergies."}
{"text":"Our favorite New York style pizza restaurant in Scottsdale! I'm not a fan of crust. So I always eat my pizza backwards starting with the crust so that I can have the best part last, but at NYPD it doesn't matter to me because the crust isn't that good! It's thin, light, airy, and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Just great pizza! We always recommend them for New York style pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza around, just like home! We are from NJ and have been searching for \"real\" pizza and we found it at NYPD pizza! Staff is friendly and the place is clean"}
{"text":"Aside from the great pizza (Vinny's is my favorite), I go to NYPD for the GARLIC KNOTS!  I could throw down a six-pack without thinking twice.  Each bite-sized knot packs a serious garlic and buttery punch.  Every now and then I get the garlic cheese knots, but most times I stick with the original."}
{"text":"I usually have a large Wall Street delivered but Brooklyn family is good too.   It's good pizza.  But it's not the cheapest. Get what you pay for I guess."}
{"text":"New to the area and have ordered from them twice. The pizza is good, but overpriced, in my opinion. Everyone raves about the garlic knots...they were good, not great, just good."}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Stopped here for takeout with friends.  Had a salad which was very fresh and delicious.  Pizza was tasty and hot upon pick up.  A little out of the way for a regular pizza for us but definitely a good place to go for a pie!"}
{"text":"I couldn't be more pleased to find NYPD near my new home in Scottsdale. Their pizza crust is thin and bubbly, and the ingredients are fresh. The fresh mozzarella is especially good. It's as close to Grimaldi's as I've gotten since I left New York. The staff is friendly. The beer is cold. Excellent.  (By the way, in regards to all the hyperventilating about how every pizza place in New York is wonderful and that any attempt to make a pizza outside of metro New York is doomed, puhleeze. Most pizza joints in New York serve pretty average pie. Some are bad. Patsy's is great. But if you want consistently great pizza, go to Italy.)"}
{"text":"I gave it 1 star... but that's an overstatement. The food was below average! Yesterday was National Pizza Day and to think- \"oh no we're not going to order from Pizza Hut or Barro's or Hungry Howies or Jets or Dominoes- no we're going to order from NYPD tonight\"- even though it's TWICE the price. $28 for a small pizza, 6 wings and something that was supposed to be crunchy zucchini but turned out looking more like dark brown salmon croquettes, which were not crunchy at all by the way. The sauce was good on the wings that we asked to be fried crispy but were not. Too tired to take the food back or call and make a big deal- so here's a review to warn anyone else in the near Chandler area. Trust me- I live within 5 minutes of this place and there are 10 other pizza places to choose from that offer better tasting and more appealing food for better prices. Never again NYPD."}
{"text":"So I gat a message from Nikki in customer service and apologized for my experience and ask me to give NYPD another try which we did tonight with a dine in. We were taken care by Cody who was very nice and took great care of use. I ordered the same pizza with wings honey hot. John came by to check on on us which was great customer service.   The wings honey BBQ hot were excellent and some of the best I ever had.  We had the cicilian  Hawaiian and 1/2 pepperoni was was delicious.    So NYPD good recover and I am happy to update my review and thanks for the great service Codey, John and Luke."}
{"text":"Met some friends for Pizza Friday Night. This place gets very crowded so plan accordingly. Our table ordered garlic knots, 2 mediums and one Gluten Free Pizza. We were told the pizzas are handmade so expect 30 minute wait. It only took about 20 minutes have piping hot pizza delivered to the table. Everyone enjoyed the pizza and knots (although they were more rolls then knots). We all ordered desert, again very tasty, but took close to a half hour to be delivered to the table! That wait seemed a bit excessive. The waitress was helpful and polite but we hardly saw her. Celiac Review I called NYPD the morning before we planned on dining eating there. I spoke with the manager and she told me that the Gluten Free pizza is cooked in a separate oven, they use separate utensils, and that all but a few of their toppings were gluten free (meatball, fried zucchini, and breaded chicken). She made sure to tell me that they do use flour in their kitchen and although they are trained and can handle Gluten Free requests there they call there pizza \"gluten sensitive\".  When we arrived at the restaurant I spoke to the waitress about my gluten free needs and she sounded well trained in the requests. I ordered a pizza with several meat and veggie toppings. When delivered to the table it looked good but it had to be sent back to be cooked a bit more. The crust was tasty but very crumbly. I suggest ordering the gluten free pizza well done as that seemed to firm up the crust a bit. Not too bad for a then crispy crust. I also ordered the GF chocolate \"cake\". It's exactly like the chocolate dome from PF Changs but served warm chocolate sauce on it. DON'T EAT THE ICE CREAM. I found out that they use shamrock vanilla ice-cream and shamrock lists restaurant packed vanilla ice-cream as one of their non-gf items. The manager worked with me on this even went as far as brining the tub of ice-cream out. They remade my desert without ice-cream and even took it off the bill (very nice of them but unnecessary).  In the end I didn't get sick and the food was good. We will go back again!"}
{"text":"Lunch specials are not to bad.  Loved the Antipasto salad.  Perfect lunch portion. Lettuce cut to perfect bite size pieces. Everything in the salad from meat to olives were so good.  The house dressing it is delicious. Friend had the calzone. Looked different. Well it looked more like a ricotta calzone more than anything. I might not ever try it. She was told there was mozarella and pepperoni and sausage but I really didnt see any of that going on.  Oh and they do have New York water you can serve yourself. lol.  That was pretty good with some lemon.  So try to make it ther before the lunch rush and you may get some decent parking.  They also have valet if you feel like parking right by the building and do not like to walk. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I will not come back to this location. My antipasti salad was so disgusting and the staff did not seem to care. This Location needs to work on that. I did have that awesome salad in the downtown location."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in the east valley... Best I've had so far at least. My favorite is the white pizza but I can eat anything here! Slices are huge and filling, and a large will feed you for days. Good service too.  I do wish NYPD had longer hours, as they close at 8pm even on weekends. I've done delivery, take out, and dine in - but delivery is not always an option as they near their closing hours.   You really can't go wrong at NYPD pizzas anywhere in the country, so I'm happy I have one close to home. I will always choose this place when I'm craving pizza!"}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here in a long time, but as I recall it, one of the very few places where I've eaten great spinach calzones.  Big, cheesy, crispy, and flaky dough- I HATE doughy calzones.    Good pizzas, too.  And the chocolate cake!"}
{"text":"Didn't like this place for the longest time because I thought the pizza was too greasy but I gave it another try and WOW! Not sure what changed but their pizza is fantastic! Not only that but I gotta say, they have some of the best upstate boneless wings in town! If you want something fairly priced say a personal pan pizza to your liking and some of the best wings in Scottsdale, this is the place for you! The staff was incredibly nice and seemed to work so hard in making sure your experience is authentic and delicious! If you're up this way, check it out and have a meal!"}
{"text":"I visited NYPD this past Saturday. I haven't been here (or it may have been the other location back then) in years since I was a kid, but had a craving for really good pizza and from what I remember, this place has great pizza. So I came with three of my cousins. We knew it was Saturday night and would probably be busy, but we went anyway. It was pretty busy so we were seated by the door which I didn't even care about since the place smelled so good. I was looking forward to getting some broccoli pizza (which very few places have) and I'm sure that would have been great... if we ever got any service.  This was really upsetting. It was pretty busy that night so we waited 10 minutes without drink orders without complaining... and then 15 minutes.. about 20 minutes into our sit-in, I notice that there were people cleaning the empty table next to ours and waiters standing around. Now that I think about it, maybe they didn't even notice that we needed service. But nonetheless, no one came and even asked if we wanted water. Eventually, we just left and had to get food somewhere else.   Really disappointing."}
{"text":"This is a great pizza place!! The pizza is really fresh and tastes amazing! The price is really reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza! Great place to just hang with friends and have great pizza and beer."}
{"text":"I simply love the pizza here and to me there is no better New York style pizza anywhere in the vicinity. I can't say enough great things about the pizza here and sometimes when I want to New York style pizza, this is my go to place."}
{"text":"These guys do a GREAT gluten free pizza. Always friendly, fast service. I get pizza here every time I come to AZ for work. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Parking sucks in this area but there are so many great food options at this corner now it is hard to pass up.  They have free valet now which helps tremendously on this side of the corner.  I love NYPD pizza and now they have a great gluten free pizza option that is the best I have ever had.  I am not 100\" gluten free but stay away as much as possible and now I can have pizza more often since they have a great gluten free one.  They have great wings here too and if you like white pizza it is also one of my favorites.  I am usually a pepperoni jalapeno kind of dude and you cant go wrong with that either.  This location is nice new clean and very casual like the rest of NYPD locations.  They have a small casual bar, and you can order in line or sit down and get service."}
{"text":"I love NYPD, the pizza is always awesome they have the best honey BBQ chicken wings every (they but BWW to shame).  Service is always great here as well and the location is great because it is in the NW valley with good parking.  They also deliver and I just found out yesterday that they have great lunch specials with great prices, you can get a slice of peperoni for $2.25, that is insane!"}
{"text":"Our server was hard to find and just got everything wrong. Special requests were ignored and the kitchen was blamed. We ordered a large pizza and after a long wait a small came to the table. Our drinks remained empty more than once (that's how long the food took). The manager came over and apologized and after that the server had a really bad attitude. Having dined in NY I can accept bad attitudes, but this was more a spoiled kid pouting and slamming drinks and dishes on the table.  The restaurant was not that busy and they seemed to have more wait staff than they needed. So I can't excuse the poor service and getting every dish on our order wrong.   The flavor of the food is good, price is high for comparable in the area. Service is horrible so I can't recommend. I had to give it an extra star for the flavor, but the rest ruined the meal. Too bad."}
{"text":"Although some of the guys seemed a bit confused around lunch time, the service was great and quick. This was my first time eating here and its great pizza with great ranch dressing. We had pepperoni and cheese slices with a salad. The salad was big enough to share so that was nice. I would definitely order from here and get delivery or just go and eat here again. They had some renovations going on during our trip there but it was still really clean and nice inside."}
{"text":"We have always loved NYPD, but hadn't been there in a while.  Taking advantage of a recent Groupon offer we decided to go on a Friday night.  Our server, Brittany, couldn't have been better, very kind and attentive.  When our pizza came out more underdone than we liked she happily offered to bring it back into the kitchen.....which she actually did twice.  Well even though the pizza was delicious, it just was lacking in the crispiness this New Yorker prefers.  Pizza is like that.  It can vary based on oven temperature and who is making it, and personal preference.  The manager, Matt, showed concern and offered recompense which was not necessary.  We kept telling him we still very much enjoyed the evening. It is rare to get the kind of customer service that we got at NYPD tonight, and we will forever be fans!  Thank you Matt and Brittany!"}
{"text":"Clean place, friendly staff. Pizza was delicious. Only problem was I ordered a meatball sub to go and when I got back to my hotel I opened the box and found out it was an eggplant sub, not a meatball. I called and they delivered the right sub to me. That is the reason for the 4 stars. It could happen to anyone and I am glad that the problem was fixed. That being said I would most definitely recommend this place based on the quality of food and the polite staff."}
{"text":"Never had a bad pizza here. Service has always been good. Have not tried any of the pasta dishes here. Can't pass on the pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza, also very generous portions. Not to expensive and very friendly staff. 10/10 would try again!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best pizza in Arizona, seriously.   They always have a good pizza, however the last visit was hands down the best pizza I've experienced from NYPD.  Everything tasted very fresh, high quality with the perfect amount of toppings, cheese and sauce to crust ratio. My whole family raved about it and we were all pretty surprised just how good it was.  We fought over leftovers that night.   My five star is reserved for pizzeria Bianca, but that's a different playing field.    If it helps I would only rate Grimaldi's a 3 star.  I feel NYPD offers better value and taste."}
{"text":"After a fairly mediocre first experience at this location Jamie Reaths, the Assistant Director of Operations for NYPD reached out and extended an offer for us to come back and give NYPD another try. With her very generous gift card we were able to really explore the menu and try more options. We stared with traditional Hell's Kitchen bone-in wings and boneless Upstate, both which were delicious. My husband loves heat and was not dissapointed in the flavor of the Hell's Kitchen. He ordered the Brooklyn pizza which came with pepperoni, sausage, and basil. The ingredients were really fresh and the pizza was very flavorful. I ordered the Pasta a la vodka with sausage and peppers and it was the perfect blend of spicy, creamy, and fresh. I really enjoyed the kick of the sauce as well as the layers of flavor it provided. We ordered a turkey foccacia sandwich to-go, it came with a fresh side salad. I think the sandwich could have used a bit more flavor and I'm sure would have been amazing had it been toasted. Our server was friendly and helpful in providing suggestions. We received our food quick and hot. This was such a better experience and will motivate us to return in the future. I would recommend this location, thanks Jamie for inspiring us to come back!"}
{"text":"No margaritas. Just beer and wine :-/ what's a girl to do. Indulge in some dessert maybe :)"}
{"text":"Disappointed in delivery.  I ordered a 5 large pizzas two separate occasions and was told it would be 90 mins for delivery. Both times the pizza was delivered not before the meeting intended for, but after it had ended."}
{"text":"NYPD ... Best Pizza?  Hmmm, not so much.  Being an actual NATIVE New Yorker, growing up in the city and on the island, I do know NY style pizza, both good and bad.  Unfortunately, NYPD really isn't it, and it isn't even up to snuff with the BAD kind.  I have heard sooo much about NYPD over the past few years.  I had REALLY been looking forward to having the opportunity to stop by.  I finally did, today (8/31, around 1:30 pm).  Had the Wedding Soup and a slice of cheese pizza with crumbled sausage.  Firstly, while the Italian Wedding Soup was tasty, it really wasn't what I've always had back in NYC.  Also, it comes sized as a BOWL, yet it seemed like there was less in the \"bowl\" than you get from other restaurants in a \"Cup\" size.  The soup was in a bowl-shaped object (almost a plate rather than a bowl), filled to about 6\" across and less than 1\" deep.  It took me about 1 minute to finish.  It also came with \"Garlic Knots\".  I've noticed praise for them here on Yelp.  Again, they were pretty good as far as taste, but they weren't true Back-East garlic knots.  They were more like dinner rolls with garlic flavoring spread on the outside.  The slice of pizza ... now this is where I was really disappointed.  NY-style pizza is very thin crust, with an an almost round \"bump\" at the outside.  It's always very crispy, light, airy ... usually has bubbles formed in it due to being spread that thin.  The pizza I had was underdone, not hot and VERY BREADY.  It was almost like eating a big piece of white bread with Motts Tomato sauce spread on top.  The sausage was okay tasting but again was barely luke-warm and was concentrated in a strip down the middle of the fairly small slice.  Back in NY a slice of that size would be a buck at a knock-off, wannabe shop, not something that would come out of a self-respecting pizzaria.  Ray or Geno or Mamma Gina would be turning over in their graves if they knew this was being served as a NY pizza.  All in all, I was very disappointed, and completely underwhelmed.  I will make sure that anyone I speak with knows just how uninspired NYPD is.  Sorry, guys, but I'm ashamed, being a New Yorker, that you are defaming the name."}

{"text":"Good pizza for Arizona. Always friendly service too."}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be. It's been a couple years. The garlic knots, which used to be incredible, were still very tasty but they were undercooked on halfway through and just doughy. The boys shared a Margherita large and the crust - while really good - was just too thin in the middle to support the toppings. It was really a mess. The SoHO (salad pizza) which used to be an amazing rectangular flatbread is now just a regular round pizza crust...which was so tough it was hard to cut with a knife. It was still good, but nothing like I remember. Our waiter was very attentive and the restaurant itself was nice as always. But it's just become a normal pizza joint and honestly I'll probably head to Streets of New York next time."}
{"text":"This is the first NYPD I believe and I was here on opening day.  Back then the pizza was insanely good and overall it still is.  We went here for dinner while we doing Hell City at the Biltmore.  Figured it was cheaper than spending $200 on dinner there.    My girlfriend and I ordered a couple slices of pizza.  My only problem with the pizza was that it seemed the crust wasn't as good as it usually was.  I wondered if they changed it or it wasn't cooked all the way.  Usually when I eat their pizza I will destroy their crust at the end..  I ate it, but it wasn't the same.  They are also a Pepsi vendor, so that's a plus for me.    NYPD is still my favorite pizza place, but this past visit wasn't the best for me."}
{"text":"Im giving this place two stars because I love the first location at 20th St & Highland.  That place was always great.  This place was pretty bad.. at least on this visit.   We arrived to eat to see a packed parking lot. Many people were eating at Oregano's and we've always enjoyed NYPD.  As we walked in, we were seating pretty quickly.  Always a nice thing.  Nice waitress came over, took our drink orders and we also ordered an appetizer and a salad.  Within 5min, both were out and we placed our pizza order.    In came more people to eat and we realized we were going to be waiting a long time.  The table next to us  who was seating long after us asked \"I wonder what's taking so long?\"  That's when my girlfriend informed me that we've been sitting here for nearly an hour before our pizza showed up.  I learned they were short staffed, but it would be nice to let your customers know that.    When the pizza finally came out, it was over cooked and wasnt great.  Ive always raved about NYPD having the best pizza in town.  Today (at least at this location), I was wrong.  It was far from it."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years but decided to visit again since a few weeks ago. This place is still awesome!  Our server James was great and the food came out pretty quick.  NYPD still has the best garlic cheese knots.  We live near the Scottsdale/Shea location, but this place is sooooo much better.  Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"We were driving around looking for a place to have a late dinner Saturday night.  We decided to go to NYPD Pizza, but didn't realize they closed at 10pm (figured they were open until 11pm).  We got there at about 9:40pm, and were promptly seated.  The place was practically empty, two tables looked like they were just finishing.  However, our server, Dominic, never made us feel rushed at all.    We ordered 2 ice teas, which he brought over quickly.  We ordered some garlic knots, which were delicious!  They could've had a bit more garlicky-ness, but even so, they were really good.  I ordered the lasagna, which came in a baking dish, oozing with sauce and melted cheese.  It was amazing!  The portion didn't look too big, but it was incredibly filling.  The big chunks of sausage/meatballs really made it for me.  I like lotsa meat, and this satisfied in every way.  Plus, the cheese was gooey and...yummy!!!  Hubby went with the 14\" pizza, just cheese.  When it was brought to the table, Dominic asked if it was too burnt.  It was a bit charred in the middle of the top, but not on the bottom.  He actually asked if my hubby wanted another pizza made.  But, he likes it that way.  And, said it didn't taste charred at all.  He loved it, and ate a little more than half (took the rest home).  My hubby's also a sucker for a good cheesecake, so since he was so stuffed, ordered a caramel sauced one to go.  I have to add, we do like to eat late, and lots of times we're the last ones in a restaurant.  Most of the time, we're getting the evil-eye, while the staff start cleaning up around us.  But, here, we never felt like we were bothering anyone.  Our waiter was on point with refills and making sure everything was alright.  And, no one was sweeping up next to our table, making us feel like we were in the way.  This is the way to treat people, and next time, we'll make sure to get there a little earlier.  And, I must say...there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"I had dinner with a group of 12 people and I have to say I had a great experience. We ordered wings, bruschetta, artichoke dip, and pizza.  Everything was delicious and our server was very prompt.  I will be visiting NYPD again!"}
{"text":"We enjoy coming here with the family. The pizza selections are good, the kids menu is a hit from the Mac-n-cheese to the pizza bites, the daily specials are great (mostly the wine ) and the staff are always friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, had some boneless honey hot, tasted like bbq sauce to me. Had a big kahuna I love pineapple pizza and it was good but I like more of a crispy pizza and this was more doughy than I prefer. My son had the regular wings he said they were good, the pizza he had was cheese with garlic and he's a kid so he enjoyed it. Service was good, ate outside it was enjoyable and nice ambiance... Would I come back probably if in the area but if not I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Update:  never went back, but...  It turns out that these people are lousy neighbors.  When zoning changes were done to allow this and other businesses in the My Florist complex, there were a series of stipulations concerning parking, loading and unloading etc.  This place manages to violate most of them.  Deliveries occur in the middle of the night at a spot not authorized for such activity, huge trucks are left idling for as much as an hour at 4 in the morning, their own delivery vehicles park in the alley where it is clearly posted  \"no parking\".  Across the alley is a residential neighborhood that this business shows no regard for.  Continued attempts for resolution via building management have yielded no results.  Living nearby, I received a coupon in the mail for $10 off of a pizza.  Figured I couldn't go wrong.  Ordered an 18\" with pepperoni and 1/2 side of roasted red peppers, for pickup.  They said it would be 25-30 minutes which seemed a bit long for pickup.  When I arrived to pick it up, within the 25-30 minute window, it was not ready yet.  It ended up about 33 minutes total, not a disaster, but not great.  When I got home with it, it was hot, so it is clear it had just left the oven when handed to me.  Sadly, it was soggy in the middle.  The crust had promise, the outside crust was tasty, but it appeared to have needed to be cooked longer, odd given how much time that they had.  The pizza itself was a little too saucy and cheesy for my taste, although the sauce might have solidified a bit if it had cooked longer.  This bad pie might have been a freak occurrence, an outlier, but we have a lot of pizza choices and I doubt that I will bother with this place again.  Z Pizza on Thomas remains my goto place for a good pizza.  We also do carryout from Pane Bianco when in the mood.  I would order from Domino's before I would risk this place again."}
{"text":"This is going to sound weird, but their hot, hot wing sauce is amazing.  I get 3 sides in takeout and use it at home on everuthing.  If I could buy a pint I would."}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza!!! Great service. Placed my to-go order and Daniel invited me to sit down and relax to a comp beverage from the soda fountain. With me, its the little thing that impress. Good Job!!"}
{"text":"We love this NY. The friendly staff are always awaiting us with a smile. We go to family dinner here often as it is has great deals. Nice patio seating, a well stocked bar &  TV's for watching the game."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza spot. Beer was ice cold and the server was nice and on top of his game. Will go back."}
{"text":"Although a bit $$$, the pizza here is really great!  They have the traditional \"NY style\" pizza, square, flat and regular.  We enjoyed the traditional with all sorts of toppings.  Huge slices and only took 20 minutes to be ready for our pickup."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Bumped up the rating because the service was really good.  I'm from the tri-state so I've had my share of pizza. The pizza isn't really comparable to the real stuff but in general, their pizza isn't bad. Thin, crispy, and they load on the toppings. The calzone was much more dough than filling which was a bit disappointing. The garlic knots though were one of the best I've had though."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! The staff was super friendly, the food came out very quick and tasted incredible. I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Came across this awesome place while searching yelp.  We are new to AZ from CA.  We had the best pizza.  It's been two years since we have had a great Pizza Pie.  I highly recommend.  Their NYPD beer is awesome!  Our server Rocio was so wonderful!  Very accommodating and made awesome suggestions!  Going to be our weekly hang out!  Atmosphere is awesome!  If I had kids I would come on Wednesday and Sundays as kids eat free.  Thank NYPD great experience! We love their Vegan Gluten free pizza!  It's amazing"}
{"text":"A sporadic text message from my friend had me wondering what to have for lunch. Before I could figure it out, he was already ready to go. So I turned on the GPS on my phone, and found a place nearby on Yelp. I really hesitated to go here, and was so close to insisting on Chipotle instead. However, I figured I would give NYPD another shot.  I rarely leave food unfinished, even if its mediocre. But the wings that came with the lunch special were so bad that I just could not finish them. If there wasn't any hot sauce, I probably would have vomited. Did they decide to just take week old wings and serve them? I am incredibly disappointed. I seriously have never had wings as bad as NYPD's in my entire life.  The pizza slice was ok, but seriously why bother selling stuff that is just plain terrible? I'm really going to hesitate coming back here. In fact, I probably wouldn't come here even if a friend invited me for lunch and paid for it. One of my worst experiences ever."}
{"text":"Great pizzas with crispy crust and fresh tasty toppings.  Mondays and Tuesdays are buy one, get one half off days for pizza.  Their wings are also quite good, full of flavor."}
{"text":"Crispy thin crust, and fresh flavorful ingredients.  Very highly recommended if you want a good quality pizza."}
{"text":"NYPD has my favorite pizza out there. It is a little pricey but so is most other places. It is totally worth it. Always make sure you get garlic knots. They are cheap and filling. They come with marinara to dip in that is sweet and tastes amazing. The calzones here are very big and tasty as well. I highly recommend their food. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. They have good dessert choices as well.  The restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. My Sicilian pie was way overcooked. Crust hard, mozzarella brown/blackish. Cook comes out to explain that it is \"ok\" that is \"just the way HE likes it\", well guess what HE wasn't eating it, and HE wasn't paying for it. I went back the next night to try a calzone, and same thing overcooked and burnt crust/dough. Very disappointing since at the other locations this was not my experience. This one is closest to where I live now and it would have been nice to have, but unless this guy learns how NOT to burn everything, I will not be going back. All crust should not be dark brown to black. Hint: lower the temp and less time in the oven."}
{"text":"Went back there again and as usual everyone was exceptionally helpful and every pizza was just as we ordered it. Love their micro brew!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! They are VEGAN FRIENDLY!! *clap clap clap*   We were seated immediately, got our drinks quickly, our order was taken and the waitress told us that our 8\" pizza would take a little longer. It's nice to be welcomed with great service.   I ordered the Veganizza (pizza with marinara, vegan cheese, basil, spinach and tomatoes) I ordered it without spinach because I knew my toddler wouldn't eat it with \"salad\" on it, lol. Then I ordered a kids spaghetti with marinara sauce and no butter/cheese. It was actually brought out earlier than the other dishes and that is awesome!! My son wasn't even finished with it actually before they brought the rest of the food! The portion size of the kids pasta tho was way too huge!! An adult could hardly eat it all so my two year old barely made a dent in it! My mom ordered an Asiago Caesar salad (note: she is not vegan).   The food was delicious; we all agreed upon that. Kids eat free Wednesday's and Sundays after 4pm! Score!!!! And they had some other deals such as 50% off a second pizza on two days (I forgot them, tho lol). The decor is pizza-y and fun. Wait staff was great and prompt and helpful. Food was delicious.   We shall return!"}
{"text":"Okay this pizza ROCKS!  We always have to order 2 pizza's because my husband does not like my creation.  I do a double ricotta, spinach, fresh tomatoes, and it is amazing!  One time I waited a bit for the food, they were very busy and the manager came to deliver it, comped the pizza AND gave me a cert. for a free one.....seriously who does that!  Loyal customer here.  We are getting it tonight.  Sometimes they offer some good coupons in the mail, they can be pricey, but well worth it.  Wed. kids eat free."}
{"text":"Our Margherita pizza was pretty good. Caesar salads were better than most chain restaurants or pizza parlors. Service was friendly & prompt. Atmosphere was A-OK. Would we go back? Maybe so.  Overall it gets the Yelp \"A-OK\"  rating."}
{"text":"So I have given them a few more chances--- the next time I tried it they still didn't get it right. But the last 2 times they got it right on..... I think I have made friends with the Manager, not sure if that is good or bad but Ill take it. Well I do know that he knows me by name now. I like to think he notices when I order and double checks it before it goes to for delivery. David-- thanks for making my orders correct. Everything was perfect and arrived at a decent time on friday :) My only wish is that they would offer the lunch specials with delivery during the lunch hour. Thanks NYPD for making my order right!!"}
{"text":"We go here frequently for lunch. We love the buffalo caesar salad. The service is really going downhill at lunch. We filled our own drinks a few times at our last visit. 2 out of 3 of our orders were wrong. Our waiter was training a new waitress -- might want to rethink allowing him to train bc he made many mistakes serving us. Wrong order, No drink refills, and reminded him 2 times about our bank of america discount and he still forgot. Guess its time for a new weekly lunch spot."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great pizza, good wings, good service....a great spot for NY Pizza. Also they have a great selection of slices at lunch time. I recommend this spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Garlic Cheese Knots and Fresh Mozzarella were amazing! And the Calzone is MASSIVE!!!  I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite things to do is order a pizza in person and sit at the bar and have a beer. The beer at NYPD is really great, as well as the atmosphere. The pizza is really outstanding for take out! I love the friendly service and would recommend NYPD to anyone who has never tried it!"}
{"text":"I would have given this location 2 stars bit I love the restaurant.  My friend and I normally eat at the one in 7th Avenue but we're near this one.   The pizza was good but my antipasto salad was so soaked with olive oil it was so gross. No balsamic  in it just spices.  It ruined the best part of the meal which I was looking forward to.  When I brought it to our waitresses atten ton,  showing her the half of a cup of oil in my salad all she could do was say. ...\"uhhhhhh\" I just went back to my both.  Obviously she had not complaint to the manager.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I would like to start off with my very first trip here about a month ago was absolutely delightful!!!  Their antipasto salad was amazing!!!  Now... to this current visit.  I ordered the same exact thing and to be honest, I am getting disappointed in the \"special balsalmic\" dressing that they make.  It has SO MUCH THICK OIL than anything else, it leaves your salad DRENCHED in oil and that's what you taste.  It ruins it!!! You end up blotting your salad to soak up the excess oil.  It makes the lettuce soggy quickly.  (this same exact thing happened at the Surprise location as well.....so it is disappointing)  We asked the waitress who walked by our table and she clarified on the ingredient ratio for oil to vinegar and I think they need to rethink that OR be consistent and have 1 person make the stuff. Seriously. Consistency is the key.  I showed her my salad and poured out on a plate as to what actually my \"dressing\" looked like.  She agreed it didn't look good either.  She was nice enough to offer me another salad, but I ate the one I had, so instead gave me a free lunch because I was unhappy about spending 10 dollars on my meal that half of it tasted like I was eating an oil sponge....     She then proceeded to tell me that I should ask for a spoon the next time and have the dressing on the side so I could take out what oil I didn't want.  What the heck???? If I have to do that, what is the point of paying for it?  May as well eat a salad at home with my own dressing that I DON'T have to mess with or alter, right?  So, in my opinion if you are a salad lover and want to try their salads... don't get the balsalmic dressing.  Go for ranch.  You are safe with that.  I am a fan of the pizza there.  It is tasty.  I love the Big Kahuna!!!  Also, I will have to say, they do care about their customer satisfaction, which is great and they don't get defensive about any issues customers have so I gave them 4 stars for that alone.  Thanks for reading....."}
{"text":"This place has good vibes all around.   I discovered them through Groupon, and because they're right down the street from me. The restaurant is tucked into the corner of a shopping plaza on Camelback & 20th St, right next to Fry's.   There are a few different options for dining here. You can order at the counter for a grab and go option. I saw quite a few people come in an pick up orders that they called in. They also offer delivery. Of course there's a dine in option as well. They have a small bar where you can sit, as well as indoor and patio seating too. After coming here twice, I've had an overwhelming feeling that the tables inside are in desperate need of reorganization. It feels a bit too spread out in there.   The service has been good on both occasions that I have gone. Everyone who works in the restaurant seems to be very friendly and welcoming. I've only been on weekdays and both times I think the bartender was also serving as a waitress which made things a bit held up when the restaurant unexpectedly filled up around 8 PM on a Monday night, but the staff handled it well and did their best to make sure everyone was taken care of.  They have a decent draft list of beers, about 5 options, with one of them being an NYPD custom beer. Some happy hour specials too which included discounted beers and pitchers.   As for the food - I have tried a few different things. The garlic knots, bruschetta pizza, bruschetta appetizer, and penne ala vodka with sausage and peppers. All of it was very good. The portions on the pasta are BIG! Not that I'm complaining, I love leftovers. I want to try the dessert because they look incredible and they seem to have a variety of options.  I'm so happy to have a great pizza place like this nearby and I plan to return in the future."}
{"text":"I went in to NYPD Pizza to get a couple of slices of cheese. I sat at the bar and the server didn't give me a menu? Finally, I placed my order and not once did he ask if I needed anything. I got my pizza and when I was finished, I had to track him down to get my bill. He was talking to one of his co workers? The place was not busy so I can't understand why I got poor customer service. Oh I'm from New York and this is not New York Pizza!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place. Hubby and I came in for dinner. Our waiter was great...recommended an alcoholic cider to drink...when I said I usually didn't like those he offered a sample. YUM!! We ordered the fried zucchini...best I've had. I love the fact that the outside is so crunchy but the inside is not soggy and gross like a lot of places. We had the white pizza and the margarita pizza cooked crispy. Again, couldn't have asked for better food!! Will be back!!"}
{"text":"NYPD is an excellent small chain. Top notch pizza sauce flavor, excellent crust and lots of cheesy goodness. Their sausage topping is one of the best available anywhere. Their cheese knots are also very good.  The pricing is higher than many NY styled pizzeria joints, but the consistency of flavor and excellent results each time keep me coming back.  I've never come to NYPD and been disappointed in the taste or temperature of a pizza.  I have not ventured out to try other items on their menu, so you are on your own if you veer away from the pizza pies.  My favorite selection is the Brooklyn Family, which features pepperoni, sausage, and basil on a healthy bed of cheese. \"Healthy\" in that context is a euphemism for \"a lot\". :)  Anyways, this location is usually without a wait and while the preparation of the pizza can take 25 minutes, having a garlic cheese knot order to wait is an excellent choice."}
{"text":"First, the pizza was great.  Probably in the top three I've had in Phoenix.  Second, the delivery got screwed up.  Third, when I called in, Christine the manager SWIFTLY took care of the issue and made me fully satisfied.  It was obvious that she is a professional, and has high standards for customer service.  I'll order from them again."}
{"text":"Just wanted to update my prior comments as I discovered management reads these Yelp reviews. Let me start by saying that they apologized for a bad dinner experience and sent us a $20 coupon for our next dine in visit and not only that , but did NOT charge us for the meal.  That is an awesome way to earn our business and look forward to giving this place another try based on the nice way we were treated after an unpleasant experience.  Kudos to the mgt..  Will post another review on our next visit."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. We got a cheese and pepperoni Sicilian and it was so good. Cheese tastes so fresh, their sauce has a bit of sweet to it, nice thick crust and the spices are awesome. Also got some garlic cheese knots and those were good too! And the marinara dipping sauce goes perfect with it. Didn't get to dine it this time but I'll be back to come in for some wings and a beer."}
{"text":"I love their vegan pizza, eggplant parm and even the garlic knots if you get them without cheese . Plus they give a 10% discount for local employees ."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool! What you would expect out of a NYPD Pizza place. It was decorated in a modern NY style, with a huge kitchen in the back. We decided to split the Brooklyn Family pizza and had a few drinks while we waited. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to prepare, it was nice that our server let us know that upfront so we were prepared. Our server (I wish I could remember his name) was very nice, sweet and funny. When you come to smaller restaurants like this that aren't so busy, its nice to have staff that visit a little with you. He gave my friend a few different samples of the beers they had and they discussed different beer options while I sat back and enjoyed by drink. He saw a picture of my son on my phone and asked me about him and then told me a little about his family. I thought it was very kind of him to have a little conversation with us while we waited on our lunch.  When the pizza came out it was delicious! It was thin crust with a thicker edge, filled with cheese, pepperoni, sausage and basil! We ate every last slice! That was at least 3-4 slices each! Perfect size for 2 hungry adults.  Enjoyed the atmosphere, the staff and the food! We were able to walk out with a huge pizza and a few drinks for under $30! Perfect! Keep it up NYPD"}
{"text":"We are in the Concord area with some regularity, and it always seems to be around dinnertime. Pizza by the slice comes in handy at those times, since we're always headed somewhere, and it's a quick and easy meal. Rather than our usual stop of Rosario's, we decided to try NYPD across the street.  The staff was friendly, and the food was served quickly and HOT. Now I don't just mean warm, I mean hot. This is lawsuit hot, like you have to wait another ten minutes just to let it cool enough to safely consume. Perhaps why they only have a couple of booths inside - you aren't really expected to eat it there. If you were driving home, the food would be a safe temperature.  As to the taste? It's reasonable, but nothing out of the ordinary. For my own tastes, I would prefer Rosario's across the street, especially since if I'm in the market for a slice I want it then. If I am going to have to take it home to eat, I'll make up something myself.  Update: They may indeed have closed. Not sure if this is permanent at this point. Time will tell. Could just be not paying rent."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town, or at least the best you don't need to wait hours for! Order pizza there about once per week and usually on Friday. Only issues are with the persons who answer the phones. They are usually not paying close enough attention and I wind up repeating myself 4 or 5 times until they are able to read my order back to me -it's very frustrating. Not tonight!! Tonight, Vanda answered the phone! She was clear, professional, attentive to detail and accurate. I told her she should answer the phone all the time and she said I made her smile. Vanda, u rock! And NYPD Pizza, you'll always be my go to, outside of pizza back home in NJ!"}
{"text":"Pizza was delivered with box pressed against pie ruining cheese.  Pizzas were transported on an angle. Ingredients slid to one side.  Pizza was undercooked.  No plates were given. Called manager, he told me he would take the \"opportunity to re-direct his crew\", that is the douchiest thing I've ever heard, you are not from New York.  This is New York: \"I'm gonna redirect my business outta your joint\".  I've been coming here for 12 years. I'm from New York, I was always impressed. Now I'm not.  I have ordered a lot of staff meals for my office. Maybe you have a new manager, maybe a venture capital group bought you. Who knows, I really don't Care, you have lost my business."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my Phoenix staples when I lived here 7 years ago or visited in recent years.  After going today, I don't know if this is going to be a must visit for me anymore.   At lunch you have the option for express lunch and order from the counter and serve yourself drinks or you can sit down and get the same deals & all the menu options.  I hate taking a server's table, so we elected for full service.  It was busy, but not crazy busy today for lunch.  Our server had a trainee, but it seemed to take forever for everything.  At the end, he apologized for giving crappy service.  He was very polite, but just missed all the serving point.  I had to get a refill on our iced teas on my own from the self service area  since we waited so long with empty cups. I also had to bring my cold pizza back up to the counter. They offered to re-cook it, but I hate wasting food.  They re-heated it, but they went a little aggressive and almost burned it.  The lunch speacials are great since they give you a slice and multiple other options: another slice & drink, wings, salads, or garlic knots; at a reasonable price.    Will I be back?  I'll give them another shot since I have really liked this place for years, but I was really disappointed in today's experience."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza and wings in the city.  Definitely worth the trip and while it's a little pricier if your a dominoes fan, bit the two don't compare.  If you haven't been in yet, treat yourself at least once"}
{"text":"Antipasto salad: Middle of the road. The dressing I couldn't really taste. The salad came with hunks, or salami, and ham.  They did hook a brother up wiff a side of Peperoncini's. I bit those all open and drizzled the goodness onto the salad for some Fla-VA!   I didn't get any of their Pete-zer, this go round, I usually do, but just wanted a salad."}
{"text":"Got the 10\" pete-zer with all the veggies and meats (Minus Anchovies) it was very good. I came for dinner it was a little pricey for the size of the pie. But their lunch specials blows the competition away with the all you can eat 1 topping slices."}
{"text":"This review is based on take out...  Since it was NYE we decided to treat the family to extra yummy salad, pizza and wings.  Being from NY it's definitely the closest to \"home\" that we found so far. The antipasto salad was \"skimpy\" in the toppings department, the boneless wings were soggy and the pizza was just okay. One of the pizzas had huge dough bubbles on one side, therefore lacking cheese and toppings.  Probably something beyond your control but definitely not the pizza quality we've become accustomed to at NYPD.  Again it was NYE, and you were really busy...but nonetheless our meal left us underwhelmed. Your prices are definitely higher then other local options but typically the experience is well worth the higher price tag."}
{"text":"I recently moved into a neighborhood in NORTH surprise.... very nice house... but NO ONE delivers to our neighborhood. No pizza. No chinese. No nothin!  Until one day, what do I find hanging from my door knob? Like a golden glowing beacon of light... an advertisement from a place called New York Pizza Dept that says they deliver to my house!!!!!   Immediately, we cancel any plans for dinner we had and order some pizza. And I'm glad to say we were not let down. They have some pretty damn good pizza! It's not the best in the world but, if Papa John's or Pizza Hut ever decide to deliver to our neighborhood, I wouldnt order from them... and not because of any loyalty to NYPD for being the first to deliver... but because its actually good pizza!  I just had their Calimari, which was delicious, and a Sicilian pizza (the square kind)... sooooo good!  Also, if they're late with the delivery (like they were the first time we ordered... but I didnt care... cuz no one else delivers!), they might give you a $20 credit like they gave us.  Eat up!"}
{"text":"I haven't had any pizza yet, but I'm hooked on the Caesar Salad and the Caesar Salad Wrap with Grilled Chicken.  You might have to wait a few minutes for them to prepare your meal, but you know it's fresh and it's GOOD!"}
{"text":"Thanks for the pizza but I really was expecting the traditional New York style it was still good."}
{"text":"I am giving an update on our 1 star review on our experience at NYPD on 1/22/2013. After posting our review on Yelp, we received an immediate response from Richard S. from NYPD, acknowledging our concerns of that afternoon. We were asked to give a contact number where we could be reached. My husband received a phone call the very next day from a very apologetic: Nichole, listening, understanding and agreeing with our issues during that visit. She was gracious enough to reimburse us the full amount and have personal apology note sent from the Managers. I have to say that NYPD Corporate handled our complaints to the best that they could and with that, we will give them another try. Thank you, NYPD Pizza"}
{"text":"We very rarely order take out Italian, as it's either too cold or soggy when I get home. I was in a bind yesterday for lunch. I went to this NYPD location and I couldn't have asked for better service and pizza. I ordered 2 18\"pizzas, one with Extra Cheese and Pepperoni and the other with Black Olives and Green Peppers. Both pizzas took about 15 minutes, I was offered a soda while I waited. The pizzas came out and I was asked to check to make sure the order was right. They were pipping hot and by the time I came home, 15 minutes drive they were still hot and crispy.  Love the service and love the pizza!"}
{"text":"I was in 08/06/2016 and our server was Malory. The Brooklyn Family was delicious per usual and the Crispy Mozzarella was addicting. Food was and is always great here. Our service on the other hand was irritating and made me not want to come into this location again. She constantly interrupted us to push us to order and then boxed our pizza up when were still working on our first slice. She was not cut from her shift yet, she did not need our table for anyone waiting. She asked me 6 times for the payment in the space of 10 minutes. I did reach out Josh McGee per my receipt; I was never contacted. I love NYPD but I will not dine in this location again."}
{"text":"Not much pizza of late for health reasons but OH EM GEE, NYPD's Joey's Veggie pizza was simply perfection in flavor, texture and appearance. This pizza won my heart over the Margherita and Hawaiian pizzas. Our server was attentive to our party of 9 for our after-work celebration. And the manager walked by to ensure we were happy. Will definitely keep this place in mind for my next special event."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years and love, Love, LOVE NYPD Pizza.    Generally very good service with friendly staff and excellent menu.  Favorites are the Chelesa salad, pizza blanca and more recently margherita pizza - yum!!  Occasionally we splurge with a baked cookie (pizookie?).  Always go home with leftovers and enjoy as much the next day.  We usually eat in but take-out works well and so does delivery.  Check out their email specials and Mon/Tues specials too.  NYPD's got it covered."}
{"text":"We've ordered delivery from here tons of times, and if it were up to me, I would've boycotted this place a long time ago (even though they've just opened).  And it's not that I hate pizza, I friggin' love pizza.  I'm happy with just about any pizza, except for the ones I've had from here.  To put things simply, I've had cheaper and much better overnight, cold pizza from Costco that tasted better.  At NYPD, the toppings on their pizzas are sparse, to say the least, the sauce is barely there, and don't get me started on the cheese.  It's disgustingly translucent when \"fresh\", and even more so when eaten a day later.  Plus, there's barely any of it so all I see is dough, and more dough.  And grease.  Not worth the money they ask, or any amount of money really.  This is college town guys, get on your game or you're gonna lose out to the five million other pizza joints in town.  Oh, and I've had better cookies from Keebler."}
{"text":"My number 1 pizza place here in AZ so far and I'm on a mission! Don't leave without eating the garlic cheese knots !"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I loved to order delivery from this place, but lately their customer service hasn't been too great and we don't think we will order here anymore. Last night we ordered for delivery and it took over an hour and a half for our food to arrive, when they said it would be only be about 45 mins to an hour max. The pizza wasn't hot or even warm anymore, so that was a bummer. Then last week, when my boyfriend ordered his salad with extra ranch, they only gave him one Italian dressing and no ranch, so he couldn't eat his salad. I just don't like spending good money when it isn't what you're expecting to eat. Two strikes in a row, not lookin too good."}
{"text":"Ariana at the bar was outstanding. It's seems so much harder now to get excellent service and she provided just that. Ariana was very attentive, aware and extremely helpful! The wine served tasted like it had turned she immediately offered to open a new bottle and it was perfect! She knows how to properly handle food (don't touch it) knows the menu, and made great recommendations. Called the manager over just to say how great she really is, and of course he agreed. Andrew was very responsive and aware of what is going on within the restaurant. Highly recommend this location and Ariana (and Andrew) for recognizing great staff when you have it!!!!! Thanks for a great dinner"}
{"text":"I'm going to say something **sHocKiNG!!!!* so hold on to your butts!  NYPD pizza is better than Oregano's pizza. 90% of the cars in their shared parking lot don't know what they're doing!  Now, pick your jaws up the floor. I won't turn this review into an apology for Oregano's (who will never leave my heart for MANY reasons: Guacatony, all salads, baked pesto pasta, the list goes on and on and on and...) but, man. The pies at NYPD are where it's at. It's pizza at it's finest: huge, foldable slices, ample toppings, CHEESE, the works. The pizzas here are the stars of the show and I'm so glad we're now tuning in.  BONUS: THEY DELIVER TO ME. So when we want to indulge in Pizza Friday (or Pizza Any Other Day), we don't have to leave the house if we don't want to. And sometimes, like during this Mercury-in-retrograde garbage time, I don't want to leave the house. NYPD wins again! NYPD for Pizza President!"}
{"text":"The Sicilian Wall Street is so good!!  The garlic knots are delicious!  We visited with our of town guests and they can't wait to come back to visit to get more NYPD Pizza!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable dinner spot.  My wife and I had personal Pizzas and shared fried mozzarella and baked cookie with ice creams on top.  It tasted good, but nothing overly special.  Service was OK, but could tell server us a ton of tables.  Kept repeating to everyone I just got sat 4 times and no one else got sat.  I know how fought that is.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we no longer frequent this place after finding out, they do not make everything from scratch.  Many of their items they make here come from a mix rather than being made from scratch.  also they do not use 100% Olive oil on their pizzas  All of their pizza dough has genetically modified soy oil and soy products in them and their reasoning for using soy oil rather than olive oil is cost, soy is less expensive, soy is also linked to numerous health problems which the manager did not really care about as the bottom line is money not health of their customers.  They knowingly use genetically modified ingredients and mixes which contain unhealthy ingredients.  Restaurants should use healthy ingredients and this one does not.."}
{"text":"This place has pizza just like they do in Queens, NY.  Original Traditional NY Pizza.  The Pizza is good if you like original NY Pizza thin crust if you are looking for something else besides Cheese pizza then this place is not for you.  Also I have never had anything delivered everything is dine in so no idea what delivery is like.  Also this place has terrible mac and cheese for children do not order it it is terrible just pasta with cheese melted on top nothing fancy actually terrible.  Also this place just got rid of their root beer so no root beer even though all the customers ask for it so the manager must not like customers much.  The wait staff is always changing and they are usually empty on Monday and Tuesday.  But they do have a full bar upstairs and a patio.  It is a little bit of NY in AZ.  enjoy the large cheese pizza dine in only;-)"}
{"text":"We use this place for big orders for work. The food comes out consistently great for everyone and they are always so organized. Super easy to work with.  They stand out for customer service (especially when compared to other places we use for big orders). Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim after Teharu would not open up 2 empty tables for my 11 person group even though we called ahead. Thank you NYPD for being so accommodating.  My girlfriend and I each enjoyed a 1 topping slice (salami). Very, very good salami and the crust was on point. The consistency of dough seemed to vary across the whole slice, but it didn't take away too much from the flavor. The slice washed down great with a pitcher of an IPA (forgot the brewery).  The waitstaff was incredibly friendly--I need to make a separate note about this. They were sweet, ready to offer suggestions, and split the check perfectly.  All in all, this is a good NYPD Pizza location."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst service ever. It took 30 minutes to get our check. One of our party didn't get two of the items he ordered. To top it off, the manager did not stop by our table to see if we needed anything.  The food is decent, but the service is so bad if I come back it will be for take out."}
{"text":"NYPD... You can't beat them! Always great pizza & garlic knots, always a great price. My favorite is the Brooklyn pizza (Pepperoni & sausage), with a slice of white pizza (Spinach & white cheeses), yum! Service is quick, even during a busy lunch, indoor & outdoor seating, and good cheesecake too :)"}
{"text":"Super yummy pizza.  Service is good.  Our server, Joseph, was very attentive. The Phoenix Ale NYPD collaboration Amber Ale is a nice addition."}
{"text":"Second try ordering online. Ordered this time despite the difficulty communicating with everyone who answered the phone. $22 before tip is pretty steep for a med pizza. Hope it's good. Fingers crossed. Will update when food arrives."}
{"text":"Quick service, friendly faces and great food. They were even nice enough to hold the door open for me as I left."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with my niece, as a little lunch date... I have to say the food was amazing! I used to go to Olive Garden for my chicken Parmesan craving, I can definitely say I will now be coming here. The food was so much tastier and the portions are really big! My niece had a slice of pizza which was very similar to New York pizza, thin and crispy! We then had dessert, the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream and that was amazing as well. I would recommend NYPD"}
{"text":"i LOVE this place. the food is amazing. the people are so friendly and greet you instantl when you walk in. the waiters/waitresses check up on you often. and the food comes out in a good time. no bad experience here yet. and when there was al ittle mistake on getting the wrong drink they were quick to get it right and very apologetic. i also love the atmosphere of the place. it looks nice but its not too fancy :)"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza place! I loved the laid-back atmosphere, and our waitress Casey was very sweet and outgoing. I highly recommend this location. Will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Slowest service I've ever had, I could have flown to Italy and brought back a pizza faster. No comment on the food after an hour and a half I gave up"}
{"text":"Last Time when we ordered we were not impressed however we ordered again, and it was delicious, delivered hot, and may just like we asked. This is the NYPD pizza I'm used to. Only thing keeping it from five stars is the hour plus delivery time. Thank you management for making it right after our last experience. Mott street meat lovers was delicious."}
{"text":"Definitely not NY pizza...I'm disappointed they actually call themselves  NYPD.   U want real NY pizza go to momma Mia or venezias."}
{"text":"This location is the best. Impeccable service and amazing food! The employees go above and beyond to ensure that you're taken care of. I will definitely check this place out again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Love the pizza. My fav is the bruschetta pizza. Just amazing. I came in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch with my sister and one year old. The waiter said it would be a lot 15-20 min when we ordered but it took more like 30-35 min and the place wasn't even packed. The waiter walked by several times when we were waiting and didn't even ask us if we needed anything. Once he was even whistling. Once it finally came I asked for some marinara sauce for the crust. The sauce had a very overwhelming taste of red wine. We wanted to order dessert but my sister was on her lunch break and we ran out of time since the pizza took too long. I'll give nypd another chance because their food is so good, but I was not impressed at all with their service today."}
{"text":"First time here service was great! Ordered a small pepperoni pizza comes with 8 slices and I was satisfied with it. Not the best pizza I've had but I will say I loved the crust. It was nice and crispy and thick enough. However, the pizza is a little on the greasy side to where you pick it up to eat and the tip drops down. A good pizza shouldn't have that problem but other than that it was good. Not sure if its enough to make me want to come back again but not off my list either."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place out of all the ones we've tried in the area. Great, fast service and fantastic pizza! Friendly, attentive staff and a great atmosphere! Try the garlic cheese knots with marinara and the house made ranch! Two thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"Always great food and great service. We often choose this NYPD for our family get togethers. They will cheerfully accommodate a large crowd. The zucchini and mozzarella appetizers are thick chunky hearty portions and never disappoint. The pizza REALLY tastes like \"back east\" and the white pizza is to die for."}
{"text":"A staple for pizza night or if you want a good Italian dinner at home without slaving over it for hours."}
{"text":"Ordered NYPD Pizza delivered for the first time tonight.  Ordered online pizza with everything.  Delivery was smooth.  Pizza was hot.  Sausage was outstanding.  They didn't skimp on the toppings.  Next time I think I'll try the thick crust so the crust is strong enough to support the toppings.  Had to eat it with a fork."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite with the lady. I ordered the Meatball Sub with side of pasta and 6 wings, she ordered the Turkey Focaccia.  Let's start with the wings, I went regular with a side of the hottest, they were really good! I would recommend them.  Both the meatball sub and her Turkey were good. They weren't spectacular but they are worth the price you pay.   I would say the pasta salad on the side was very plain. It was a pesto tossed penne which is always safe however it would be nice if they spiced them up with let's say... Black olives and feta, or any other safe combination. Otherwise they just taste plain jane.  I will be back for the pizza!"}
{"text":"When it comes to delivery, NYPD is one of the first places I think of. Their marinara sauce is delicious and I always get it with an app of crispy zucchini. This location cuts them thick the way I likes 'em. Every bite gives a juicy bit of zucchini as opposed to other places where you're insulted with a slice of wilted vegetable inside a thick coating of greasy breading.  Once, I ventured to try a different app - the garlic knots. The bread was way too soft and doughy for my tastes. I did not likey and couldn't even swallow the first bite. I hope they've changed since then.   My fave: the eggplant. They are generous with it. I can get it on a hero, with pasta, or as a pizza topping. How cool is that? Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of the pizza dough because it can never handle all the sauce and toppings I request, but I will eat it once in a while - except as leftovers. Nah, uh uh bruh.   Sometimes the salads are disappointing, because you may get unfresh greens but I usually pick those out and continue eating.  Desserts cakes are good, but the lemon cake is a bit small for $4.99 and it's not much cake in comparison to the frosting. The only other dessert I've tried was the cookie - once, will never ask for it on a delivery order again because I couldn't send it back. I will only try it again if I'm dining in."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the pizza! Makes me feel like Im home in NY. My only complaint is the phone crew. I have to repeat everything what seems 15 times before they get it correct."}
{"text":"Too often, you eat out at a place for years, and because it's not new to you, it doesn't cross your mind to write them a review on Yelp.   That's what I realized when I went to grab a quick lunch to go from NYPD Pizza today. How have I never reviewed them? Because they've been a staple for several years, isn't that more reason to give them a great review? (I promise I'm going to start going through my memory bank and start writing more of these types of reviews)  So like I said, went to NYPD for a quick bite today. Ordered a small chicken ceasar salad to go. The cashier was a younger guy and really friendly. I thought there was a deal for checking in on FourSquare, but the manager that was standing nearby said it was only for dine-in with a group of 3 or more. He gave the discount to me anyways (shhh!). Extra points in my book. Salad came out quickly...drove back to work...and enjoyed a fresh and delicious lunch! The end. =)  (Oh and their garlic knots are ridiculous too)"}
{"text":"This location just opened where the Island's Burger used to be by Raintree and the 101.  They deserve an above average rating for the great service.  They were well staffed with people who knew what they were doing and wanted very much to please.  The pizza's not Bianco's, but it's good, and there's a lot to be said for being well taken care of without any bs."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here. We've been here twice and both times the pizza was delicious and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"We have been trying to find a tasty NY pizza for two years and are thrilled with NYPD! Good crust, not too much sauce and high quality mozzarella- absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Great service! Kimberly, our server, was prompt with our orders, she was very polite and courtious. The manager stopped by and checked on us twice. Everything tasted amazing. This was my boyfriends first time here and he was very impressed. Price was not bad at all!"}
{"text":"I really like this NYPD location.  I don't know that I have been to one in the past, but I think I could be a fan if I go enough.  I came here for lunch with a co-worker, and we both had a really good time.  They have a nice menu selection, and the staff here was pretty darn cool.  When we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess, who asked us if we wanted to sit down and have a waitress, or go with the Express Lunch.  She explained the express lunch to us, and we went for it!  We didn't want to waste any time digging into our food, and I'm glad the hostess told us about it right away.  The food here was pretty good, and along with plenty of seating, a bar area, and a nice big menu, I can see myself coming back here as a customer.  Keep up the good work NYPD!"}
{"text":"The best location! My family & I went to one closet to home and didn't get he best service. We gave this location a try because we were reached out to and we loved it. Extremely pleasant, clean, and wonderful service from everyone."}
{"text":"Great pizza spot. Garlic knots were really good. Super filling. The pizza was very good. The service was pretty slow. It took our waitress approximately 16 minutes to come to our table. It wasn't busy at all during our visit, she just seemed to be a very slow paced waitress. Still a good place to eat as long as you have the time to sit. Unfortunately the waitress made me take the rating from a 4 to a 3."}
{"text":"Enjoy getting the special deal they have on Mondays or Tuesdays where you can buy one pizza and get the second half off. Their pizzas are cooked just right and the crust isn't too thick or too thin. Also, their pizza is even enjoyable later on when you nuke it in the microwave.   The staff was friendly and made sure everything was ok just enough and they were not annoying at all."}
{"text":"Yummy. The best NY style pizza. Fresh dough. Atmosphere is perfect for watching a game and noshing"}
{"text":"Best pizza we've had in the area so far. The staff is courteous. I would have given five stars but we waited about 45 minutes for our pizza. Other than that, I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow ! Just got frozen Mozzarella for dinner from here ! And to top it off the waiter snapped at my wife ! Manager on duty didn't seem to mind !"}
{"text":"ehhhhhhh...I had higher expectations for this place. But sadly, their pizza was mediocre at best. But it could be that it was the type of pizza we got.   We got the pesto chicken pizza and it was extreeeemly greasy. The food sat very heavy after, which I hate. We had stuffed ourselves with the cheesy garlic \"knots\" (rolls, more like it) which were pretty ok. So when we got our pizza, we couldn't each much of it and had a lot leftover.   BUUUUTTTT, the pizza tasted much better the next day. It was really good actually, that was nice.   The service is good. There was no wait and the food came out pretty fast."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy. Upstairs was small and Kool with a bar. 3 tables, quite,our waitresses Jan  was on point and answered all my ? This is a great place. Awesome menu."}
{"text":"We just got home from our first time at NYPD Pizza.  We heard that they serve vegan pizzas so we had to go try it out.  We were expecting more of a typical pizzeria atmosphere...much more casual and just a few tables.  It is very nicely laid out and decorated.  The staff was very friendly to us and to all of the other customers.  In addition to that, they seemed to be enjoying themselves while working.  We ordered two of the My-za pizzas (each serves one).  One was the \"Veganizza\", with Daiya \"cheese\", Roma tomatoes, spinach, basil, and garlic.  The other was a build your own and had Daiya \"cheese\", mushrooms, red onions, and green peppers.  They were both DELICIOUS!!  They were very flavorful and seasoned very nicely.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Hands down.... some of the best za' in PHX baby!! Don't skip this place, artichoke dip is phenom, and the garlic knottys will blow your face off. They deliver, and you should order it everyday!! Okay, to be convenient not everyday, but you will not be disappointed with the ingredients."}
{"text":"Great pizza, cold beer, awesome atmosphere! Any pizza is great. Love the New York flavor! Great Caesar Salad!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place i've ever eaten at!  Love the NY pizza, fast & friendly service, and the price is right too.  The secret is in the water.  NYPD Pizza is highly recommended.  This location is conveniently located just 1/2 a mile east of the Loop 101 on Chandler Blvd. =)"}
{"text":"Crispy chicken spinach salad and garlic cheese knots = YUM!  We've had the same waiter (Ryan) the last 2 times we've been here and he is super nice. :)"}
{"text":"Good food, waiter was great. Disrespectfully long cook times. 20-25 minutes from ordering desert and getting it. While the line cooks were joking behind the line."}
{"text":"I've been to a few but, none could be more friendly than this one.  Food is good, place is small but cozy.  The bar could use better TV's and more beer choices.  I'll"}
{"text":"The address using navigation is a little off, but the restaurant is here! Ordered the garlic knots as an appetizer which were delicious and came with a side of sauce for dipping. The restaurant is set up for dine in but M-F 11-4 you can buy slices and combos instead of a whole pie and get your meal much quicker. One recommendation I would make to everyone is look at the menu beforehand and be ready to order pizza as soon as you sit down because it takes 25 minutes to cook one pizza! This was a fun restaurant and I found it interesting that they match the water PH for cooking of that of New York, New York! The decorations of the building feel like a New York City subway and is fun and interesting. This is a fun restaurant to take friends to and the service will keep everyone happy!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is great. It's well made and good quality. Delivery does take a bit longer than other places and the prices are a higher, but it's easily one of the better places around. The boneless wings are my favorite item on the menu. The meat is good quality and they are always super soft and tender on the inside and crispy on the outside just like it should be. The large pizza is huge and feeds my family of four no problem and always has some left over. They seem to have a higher turn over rate then other smaller pizza places but I've never had any complaints about the staff. Overall a good place to eat."}
{"text":"My stomach grumbles every time I think of their cheese calzone.  Mostly because it makes me hungry thinking about it, but partially because my stomach hates me after I devour that much cheese.  And I even split that beast in half and share it with someone else!  Seriously. That golden-brown top brushed with butter and garlic. That combination of mozzarella and sweet ricotta cheese...it's carb heaven.  Let's not mention that I start with their spinach & artichoke dip every time.  Served with a hot crunchy/chewy pizza crust with a light layer of melted cheese and garlic.  Sprinkle some crushed red pepper on it and I would eat that entire thing myself if I could, even though it's probably meant to be an appetizer for around 4 people.  The other locations I've been to in Chandler and Avondale always have more patrons, but the food is the same--I need a gurney to get out of there."}
{"text":"The Place is closed. Too bad - Although it is a monster chain restaurant - it was a nice chain."}
{"text":"I have lived in Phoenix since 1985 and have been searching for the perfect pizza.  Finally found it. The Sicialian is excellent.  I remember walking down the streets in the Big Apple and going up to a pizza parlor with window service and buying a slice of the Sicilian pizza pie and continuing down 42nd St while devouring it.   Well NYPD did not dissappoint me.  One bite and I was hooked.  I no longer have to wander from pizza joint to pizza joint looking for the taste I have so long craved.   Now if I could just find a pizza like the Vinnie Pie I used to buy at Vinnies on Ardmore Blvd back in Pittsburgh. Well I guess you can't have it all though so I will just stick with what I have found at NYPD."}
{"text":"We had great service the whole time there. The girl gave us a quick run down of the menu and poured up a few beer samples as well. My wife went with the supreme pizza and liked it a lot. I had the chicken parm sub and it was Perfect. A few Italian favorites and a few beers= a good experience. We Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great service. They have vegan cheese which is great for my lactose intolerant little. What ever you do order some garlic knots they are the best!"}
{"text":"I have driven by NYPD pizza for years. My parents said it is their favorite pizza place, so we decided to give it a try.   I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in! It's a fun ambience, nice bar area, and plenty of seating.   Justin was our server and the last star is for him! He made excellent recommendations and brought a few samples. He was attentive and professional.  We ordered the SoHo salad which was to die for! It was fresh, right amount of dressing, served over a pizza crust. Mmmm good! My daughter had the lasagna which was also extremely good! It's a huge portion so you could split or have for lunch the next day. I ordered the Bruschetta pizza and I loved it! A nice mix of mozzarella and ricotta cheese and topped with the bruschetta. Simply delish!    I will be looking forward to visiting next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place when I was looking for pizza after work.  I love this place.  I am not usually a fan of chain restaurants but I am of this one.  The interior is brightly lit and upbeat.  The staff has always been quick, polite and willing to accomodate your requests.  The pizza is great and I am a big fan of thier house salad.  I have gone back several times and it has always been consistent."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick lunch at New York pizza.. haven't been here for many years. Had a couple of slices and a drink it was delicious. A nice friendly place to eat. Will come back again."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good place to have a gluten free pizza. I called a couple area restaurants, which did not offer a gluten free crust. We stumbled upon this place, and were happy to find that it is absolutely delicious! My husband had the sausage pizza on a gluten free crust, and he said it's the best he's had. A lot of places tend to burn a gluten free crust, but this one was cooked perfectly. My daughter and I had a small pepperoni, and I couldn't believe how big it was! Generous sizes, delicious pizza, and friendly service. We left full and happy!"}
{"text":"Excellent Blanco Pizza! The Ricotta is made on site and amazing ! You almost want a bowl of it! Their sliced mozzarella slices with Balsemic sauce are to die for!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've ever had... Waited over an hour and a half after being told 45 minutes twice. After that they delivered a pizza soaked in grease and cheap tasting pepperoni, I'd rather have a lunchable. On top of that they delivered it to my hotel room with a salad on the order and did not even put a fork or any napkins in the bag. I will go to the nearest gas station and buy the egg salad sandwich from 6 months ago before I eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Their pizza is just like New York style pizza, in part because they receive water from New York that they use in their pizza! The red sauce on the pizza is slightly sweet and delicious. All the staff is very friendly. It's a little pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"I never write reviews.  I have four kids under seven and I don't have time to think. However, tonight is exceptional. I'm in Arizona with all my kids and cousins and their children. Tonight I had seven of the little boys over for a pizza and movie night. I ordered two pizzas from NYPD and was told it would be 45 minutes to an hour.  Ouch. It's a long time when you have children fresh out of a pool. What a mistake! I could kick myself. The short story is that four phone calls and TWO HOURS LATER the food finally arrived. It was cold and disgusting. I don't know how the children ate their cheese pizza. It was probably sheer starvation. The other mom and I shared a cold BBQ pizza that looked like the air had been let out of a spray painted tire. It was lifeless and grey.  After the fourth phone call I realized they were still answering the phone \"pick up or delivery.\" What the heck? If your kitchen is so backed up that you need two ours to put out a cold cheese pizza then you need to stop accepting new orders. It's common sense and a common curtesy."}
{"text":"i just moved here from Philadelphia where NY style pizza is on every corner by \"the slice\" not to mention an hour to NYC.  NYPD pizza is a very distant cousin to real NY pizza.  Even so this is not my complaint about this place.  i have gone here 4-5 times since i moved here 90 days ago.  They are unorganized, chaotic and completely uncustomer focused at the counter.  There always seems to be a high number of youthful employees congregated behind the counter with little actual customer activity going on.  So many times i have been asked if they could take my order, or how i can be helped only to be cut off to have the same person answer the phone.  what about the other 12 people standing behind you?  Can they answer the phone? are you guys on commission to sell the pizza?  lets talk about each time you tell me over the phone my pizza will be ready in 20 minutes and when i get there 20 minutes later i still wait another 20-30 minutes. No, thanks....i have had better pizza and better customer service."}
{"text":"Who knew this hidden strip mall gem could be so wonderful?  Stopped in out of sheer hunger and curiosity after shopping and it seriously impressed.  The service was top notch, prices so reasonable,  and the food was good enough to impress my Italian foodie snob husband.  Order your pizza well done/crispy,  don't miss the zucchini,  and if you venture in on a weekend, their happy hour is generous, so come thirsty."}
{"text":"Wort experience ever it was like flushing 70 bucks down the toilet. Wings pasta and salad all flavorless. The waitress was on another planet either not trained properly or stoned out of her mind. Drive 45 mins just to go to this place waste of money."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about NYPD pizza. It's always a fun place to stop by for a slice but lately we've been using them for catering. I highly recommend using them for any sort of large function or pizza party. So far they have catered my gender reveal party, pool parties, my sons second birthday, a get together with my bridesmaids and my \"pre-wedding\" meal for all wedding party and vendors on my wedding day. Their food and service is unbeatable."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Good wings! Pizza is great. Nice atmosphere! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent service probably one the best services that I got from all the NYPD across the valley. The manager made sure my family enjoyed their food. Definitely will be back to this location for some more pizza with my family."}
{"text":"Best salads....honestly, they are amazing. I'm terribly addicted to the Chelsea chopped salad..bacon, gorgoanzola, sun dried tomatoes. ....sooooo yummy. But I change it up now and then...their seasonal salads are amazing....my other stand by, for extra hungry days is the antipasto salad...add some garlic knots and you've got a giant deconstructed grinder....I could go on.....I will...get a slice of lemoncello cake. Trust me."}
{"text":"After writing our disappointed review we were sent a free dinner voucher in the mail. We gave this location another try and it was great as expected like our usual location on union hills. Tried the mozzarella bites, wings, and pizza, all excellent. Glad they took our bad first experience to heart and made it right!"}
{"text":"Great gluten free options (drinks, salads, apps, and pizza). The salad pizza is excellent.  Wings are great! Not too fatty and crisy, the medium sauce is the way to go."}
{"text":"The new location has a much more casual get in and get out feel than the previous restaurant but still excellent food! They also deliver to nearby areas which I highly recommend I believe the delivery charge was only $3!  They have gluten-free pizza options as well and great salads!"}
{"text":"YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY. Just love the pizza here and it is nice to come mid week and enjoy ourselves. Because it is so good, they are sure packed on the weekends. Come and enjoy."}
{"text":"Yummo.  Great pizza. Great lunch specials.  Good pasta.  Pricey but worth it.  Wish they had more competitive specials for dinner."}
{"text":"I went to NYPD for lunch today. Upon entering our waitress told us we could pick any table, which I thought was nice.  When we picked our table she followed us and then announced that she would be taking care of us.  I smelled the odor of stale cigarettes on her which was not at all appetizing.  She took our drink order.  The person with me ordered a water with lemons and I ordered a tea without lemons.  When she brought the drinks, my tea had two lemons as did the water.  Not very good listening skills.  I was having doubts that this would be a good lunch, but it turned out to be just fine.  I had a salad with ranch which was good and I had baked ziti which is one of my favorites.  I love the mixture of ricotta cheese with the marinara sauce.  I did split the order with the person I was with and the kitchen split it for us.  Neither one of us could finish our half of the order.  They serve generous portions."}
{"text":"We love NYPD, food is always amazing.  We love that the food comes to you \"straight outta the oven\" :)  The only disappointment was that our favorite server Savhannah was not in this day :(  She is always welcoming and sooooo funny!  She makes us feel like we belong every time!"}
{"text":"This little pizza joint is close to my house and I visit frequently.  Sometimes my son and I go there for lunch dates...we sit at one of the high bar tables and watch ESPN.   Other times the three of us go on Wednesday nights as a family (Kids Eat Free Wednesday nights).    I can't say anything bad about this restaurant....it is close, cozy, comfortable, and has good food.   It is by far my favorite place to get pizza!  We went last Wednesday night and tried an all meat pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and meatballs...Delish!   I ate the 5 left over pieces for breakfast the next morning - so much for Weight Watchers two days in a row!  The servers are also very friendly and helpful for kids.   In fact, the decoration is kid friendly - the New York & Statue of LIberty Decor have caused my son and I to do internet research and buy books for educational purposes!  Fun stuff!"}
{"text":"Went to @NYPD_Pizza for the first time tonight, because I had a coupon for a free entree.  Now, let me make it clear, I was an idiot, and I didn't print the coupon, because it clearly stated you could merely show it to your server from your phone.  So I did that. And because I did, I didn't read \"the fine print\", which clearly stated what exactly you were entitled to. The coupon: http://goo.gl/tuIS  So after we had placed our order, I looked at the coupon again, and noticed the listing of what was included in the entree selection. Feeling a case of caveat emptor, I searched out our server, and informed her of my mistake.  Her response was fantastic; she said what we had ordered already (shells florentine) would be probably be ok, but she would verify. She did indeed check, and they claimed that since neither I nor they caught until well after the order was placed (it was only about 5 or 10 mins...) they would go ahead and make the adjustment on my check.  That's customer service, beyond and above. I fully expected to have to change my order, or pay full price for the shells, and would not have felt that it were anyone's fault but my own.  The food was pretty tasty. Along with the shells, we ordered the Brooklyn Family Style pizza, which had pepperoni, sausage, and fresh basil.  The shells were pretty good, but nothing phenomenal.  The basil aroma that accompanied the arrival of the pie was wonderful! The sausage volume was a bit sparse, but the pizza was delicious, and I would recommend it.  It was a beautiful night, so we sat on the patio. The table that we were at had a slight ant problem, but once I cleared them, they didn't return.  Our server was a bit overwhelmed, but overall I think she did a decent job, and I made sure I showed my appreciation for her efforts.  I may back, but only if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Since I work downtown I come here for lunch at least 3 times a week and I have never left disappointed. My favorites are the Italian Beef Sandwich and the Wall Street pizza (loaded with different kinds of meat). The beef sandwich is really tasty with a generous helping of beef, a mountain of cheese and a bunch of aus-jus. I also really like the lunch deal they have where you can get two slices of pizza of your choice plus a drink for less than $8 out the door. They make the crust with this special water which makes it very tasty and an amazing texture. The lemoncello cake is outstanding as well. All of the servers and staff are very warm and friendly, with a special shutout to Tawnya! I have also had their buffalo wings which are big and meaty with tasty sauces. My better half loves the Buffalo Chicken Caesar Salad. A wonderful choice for either lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The Antipasto Salad is something special to me. The first time I got it I tasted it and was kind of taken back. It has a weird taste with the artichokes and the mushrooms but it's like I just can't stop eating it. I crave it sometimes. Haha their pizza is really good too. Coming from Tennessee we didn't really have pizza like this there in the city I am from. It is pretty great. Really big pizza...."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad here, it's just not that good. I think the garlic cheese knots are pretty good and for the most part the pizza is alright.   Here is my main problem with this place, they NEVER have the kind of pizza I want. For some reason they don't sell white pizza by the slice. I was once told they do have it when they open, but by the time I went at 1 in the afternoon they were all sold out. 1 in the afternoon! Do they only make 1 white pizza a day?!?!?!? They also don't sell sicilian by the slice either. 1 time they also didn't have the \"special\" pizza of the day also.   Give me a break, you're a pizza place, you should have the slices I want and if you don't then make it for me."}
{"text":"As a NY transplant, I always hunt for authentic NY-style pizza. NYPD has recreated it well, with a good crust and sauce. It still won't compare to anything in NYC, but I dropped from 4 to 3 stars because they are overpriced in my opinion. I can go to Venezia's in the same neighborhood for $5 less per pie, and it's just as good."}
{"text":"I have tried a few different pizza's here and recently Chad M suggested I try the meatballs and jalapeno. Seriously good! The secret to this place is to have a few toppings  instead of loaded to the hilt.  If you are not into customizing your 'Za than try the Brooklyn -  it's a favorite."}
{"text":"The Chelsea salad is the best.  Pizza is NY style and very good.  If you like your wings hot, get the Hells Kitchen wings, great heat and flavor.  Have never had anything bad."}
{"text":"Fab pizza! Have to have the ricotta as a topping ! Crust could be thinner if you like thin crust !!! Great staff !"}
{"text":"I believe we caught this place on an off night. We were not satisfied, so the manager sent me a personal note and offered us a free pizza. We went back in and I must say, the pizza was really delicious this time. I found their service to stll be great, as well as their business savvy is well above the rest.   We would go back. I would recommend."}
{"text":"We've eaten at this NYPD a few times over the past few years; it's not our closest location, which is in Avondale. This is our favorite local chain.  Our experiences here have been good. The waitstaff is pleasant and attentive. When we visited this past Saturday, it was in the middle of the afternoon and quite empty. We were told our food would be out in about 20-25 minutes, and that was dead-on accurate.  My husband loves the Mott Street Meat Lover Pizza; the meatballs are fresh and divine. I almost always get the small Soho Salad Pizza. This particular time, the crust was a touch tough, but it was still delicious and the salad had just the right amount of dressing mixed in.   Plus, we were there during happy hour, so my husband happily had their ale from tap.   The parking lot immediately behind the restaurant is small, but if you drive behind the building there is a larger connected lot."}
{"text":"This wasn't our best experience at an NYPD location, but in all fairness we bombarded them with a large party at 8pm on a Saturday night. They were able to seat all 14 of us out on the patio. To our dismay, the kitchen was out of garlic knots, but all our other orders went through without issue. One guy's wings mysteriously vanished, but our servers were very apologetic and quickly brought out his wings after that.  The food was delicious, as always. We tried the mozzarella sticks for the first time. Wow. Those are amazing. They served it with marinara and balsamic vinegar. I'd never dipped breaded mozzarella in balsamic before, and it was fantastic.   The pizzas were declared delicious all around. This was a very hungry team of roller hockey players who had just finished up two hours of game play. They needed their bread, meat, and beer.  It did take an extra long time for our checks to be rung up--there were a lot of us, after all. By that time, the rest of the restaurant had cleared out so we were able to go inside. A good thing, as the night had turned quite brisk.   Everyone here was really nice. Sure, there were some burps in the service, but they did their utmost to accommodate our big group and it was greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"I live in El Mirage, there are plenty of pizza places closer but I drive the extra miles because NYPD is the best pizza around. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. If you guys could move to Dysart & Thunderbird I would appreciate it."}
{"text":"I came in here for the first time and ordered a buffalo chicken salad. It was sooooo good! I ordered large and the size wasn't that large so I'm glad I went with that size rather than the small. They have a lunch menu with discounted prices which is nice.  I will be back to try their pizzas and other menu options. So far I like it. Customer service was good too."}
{"text":"I was so craving some New York style pizza with the thin crust and huge slices!!  This place has just that...We went in evening and it was candle lite and nice ambiance music.  We got a Vinnys special and could pick 5 toppings...ricotta cheese, meatballs, smoked mozzarella, green peppers and mushrooms....Delish!  And the bruschetta as an app was very good also! my sister works here so, go ask for the Texan that works there ad be nice and tip well...lol"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The pizzas are great and the service is truly the best!!    I would recommend this place to anyone looking for traditional NY pizza..  try their zyeppolis.."}
{"text":"Got buy one, get one pizza 50% off and a side of pasta and it was delicious. Expect yummy for the prices, but not anything insanely spectacular."}
{"text":"I signed up for Yelp just to write this. I often go to NYPD for dinner/lunch. I love their food, its delicious. But today, I had a really good experience. I ordered carryout because my house is not close enough for delivery. I arrived, got my food and left. Well, it was awfully busy and when I got home I noticed they forgot my salad I ordered. I called back, and, they offered to drive out to my house (which is not in their delivery range) and deliver me personally my forgotten salad. Soon enough, a woman was at my door, salad in hand along with a coupon for a free dessert. I honestly cannot express how kind this was. It makes me happy that I can go somewhere with good food AND extreamly good service.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is fantastic!  The service is solicitous and good.  They have a cute outside area plus abar where you can eat as a single as I often do.  The wings and salads are great tho i have received some wilted greens...hence the 4 star rating."}
{"text":"We usually come here often not only because we love the food but the people who work here treat us so amazing, Scott, Ryan and of course our most favorite waitress in the world FABIENNE!! these people treat us like family and are always happy to see us come in! You cannot receive better customer service here than with them and of course the whole crew. They always make sure that everyone who comes in are all catered too!! They have many regulars/usuals and I can see why! Great place to eat! Our favorite food aside the pizza are the honey hot traditional wings they are the bomb.com! You must try, Fabienne introduced them to us and we always have to order lol they're not on the menu so be sure to ask for them!! We have been coming here for almost 2 years and we love this place!"}
{"text":"I've lived in this neighborhood for a few years now and I really want to like this place. Used to try it out almost once a week. Outside of the pizza, the consistency of food is very unpredictable. And unless you already know who to request as your server, again... roll the dice. And the management/shift supervisors... forget it. The last three times I I dined-in, I was appalled at how they treated the staff. Whistles like dogs and finger snaps like, well... I'll refrain from how I'll state that here. I'm sorry guys, but I won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Pizza was thin, soggy and lacking in flavor. We arrived on a busy Friday night, so understandably service was lacking. Pizza was pricey and lacking leaving me feeling like it was money and time ill spent. I have been to this location several years ago and remembered it to be far better than what this experience was."}
{"text":"Love their pizza, it's def the NY flavor that I remember and it's because of their NY filtered water ;-)"}
{"text":"My daughter and I sort of stumbled on this place a couple of weeks ago.  We were at the Ulta just around the corner and she said she was hungry and she LOVES pizza.  We have been here twice as of this writing.  The second time around was \"Kids Eat Free\" night.  That is Wednesay for those of you with kids and it's a good deal.  I will eventually put together a list of Kids Eat Free places in the area.  For now let me tell you about NYPD.....  The pizza is a winner!  Nice crust, great topppings!  They use paper thin slices of sausage instead of hunks of sausage.  The flavore is great too.  My daughter had a slice of black olive pizza and they were very generous with the olives....she loved it!  I have had the ceaser and the house salads and both were good and fresh.    So for the Kids Eat Free night adults need to order an entree (I think this includes a whole pizza too, not sure though) There were several things to choose from including cheese ravioli, baked ziti, and  lasagne.  I chose the lasagne and it was delish!  Piping hot with melted mozeralla over the top, I could not stop eating it!!  The flavors melded together nicely and it reminded me of my Mom's lasagne.  And did I mention the bread......OMG!!  The little ibites of heaven are sooooo good!!  I could have eaten ten of them!!  They are homemade, the real deal, yeasty goodness!!  Warm and just a little chewy, the flavor was amazing!!   Oh and the Desert Flower Ice Tea.....so refreshing!!!  I keep thinking about it, that's how good it is!!  Try the canollis.....you won't be disappointned.  Kids get an ice cream sundae with their meal.  On our first visit Lori, our server, was a real sweetheart.  She gave me some coupons and signed me up for the email list.  And on our next visit , Jessica was awesome and attentive too!  This is a small place but they also have an outdoor patio with misters.  The bar is tiny, probably seats 10.  Flat screen for watching the D'backs and some good beers on tap, along with Happy Hour specials makes this a great place!!  This will be somewhere we will frequent!!  Thanks NYPD!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had a mom/daughter day last week.  She had a dr. appointment and it would have been silly for me to drive all over trying to get back to work so I took the day off.  We went to the mall and she spent gift certificates for Build-A-Bear workshop that we had since we moved over a year ago!  She was so excited.  By the time we were done, we were hungry and she said she wanted pizza.  Well, it was Wednesday and kids eat free at NYPD Pizza on Wednesday.  So off we went.    I have been to the Camelback location several times and it was always good.  We now live in Chandler and this is the closest location. We were greeted and shown to our table and my daughter got some crayons and a plate to draw on while we waited for our food.  Everything here is fresh and I have no complaints.  The service is good and always with a smile.    I think the pizza is top notch and the pastas are great too.  The pasta portions are generous and I always have some to take home.  Great for lunch the next day!  I love the sayings on the back of the t-shirts too....Unique like a Brooklyn Accent is my favorite.  I think Tony Soprano would be proud."}
{"text":"Average NY Style pizza.  Delivery time was an hour.  It's not great nor is it memorable but it's not bad either.  Slightly better than Dominos."}
{"text":"Not the best service...but really good pizza at reasonable prices. I recommend Da Works. It was the only one I tried, but it was really good."}
{"text":"The last two times I've tried to go to Oregano's, the wait was sooo long (I'm talkin' an hour or more) that my friends and I decided to hit up NYPD Pizza next door instead.  It's small, but cute and has a little upstairs bar.  The food is good and inexpensive- but don't get the marinara pasta- I could make it better and that's not saying much.  But the bruschetta is great and the cookies 'n' cream dessert rivals that of the infamous pizza cookie at Oregano's- it's that good!   Sun-Thur:11-10, Fri-Sat:11-11"}
{"text":"Very good pizza and salads, a little.on the pricey side but not out of range for the area.  Happy hour provides some god deals on beer and wine so that helps.  The place is somewhat small so watch it for big groups but food came out in a reasonable amount of time and was delicious!"}
{"text":"SO PLEASED! READ ON! We ordered a pepperoni pizza (light sauce), garlic knots, boneless wings, spaghetti for the picky 2.5 yr old, and the Z-word things for dessert (not sure of name). EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING! Seriously, we've never even heard of the place, took a chance, and they exceeded our expectations! Perfection! Oh, the lady that took our order over the phone was SO helpful and nice! The delivery driver was polite and great too! All around EXCELLENT experience!  First place in a LONG time that has met and exceeded our expectations in every single way!"}
{"text":"The Price is Right.  I walked up to the order window met a cool dude ordered and sat at the bar.   I asked for two large slices of everything on it. $5.25. These slices are full blown, made to order, hot and delicious.  Decent New York 'style' pizza but not all that close to the pizza made in the Parlors of Manhattan but we are in Phoenix right?  Ordered a Four Peaks 8th Street brew. $4.25. Poured from a bottle into a cold clean glass. Light bodied as expected. Hops are floral and bitterness is restrained. Enjoyable for it's weight/price class.  This was a solid lunch. No wait except cooking times."}
{"text":"Walked in right as they were closing after a long day of moving. The service was unbelievable as they kindly offered to make my order. Food is excellent and service even better!"}
{"text":"Heard they had the best pizza and they didn't disappoint. I was so impressed with the food and the service. Kids eat free on Wednesday's and Sunday's too! Absolute 5 star experience for our first visit!"}
{"text":"Forget about the others, NYPD is who you should call for delivery. With numerous pizza options, pasta too, you can always find something to your liking.  Vegetarian? Go for the veggie pie or do what I do. Ask for a Vinny's Favorite My'za. Lately, the service has been excellent. Pizzas are loaded, salads are fresh. That's how I ball. https://youtu.be/Wh8jEwj3qXM  Mostly I stick to appetizers, pizza, salad, and dessert. I'll admit, I'm a creature of habit. Alternating between their garlic rolls, bruschetta, artichoke dip, personal pizzas, salads, and CAKE - yes - I'm happy with my lunches.  NYPD has some of the best marinara I've tasted. Not too tangy and doesn't taste overly sweetened. It's like tomatoes at their peak ripeness were picked and stomped on. (Yeah, they put their foot in it.) Then dashed some oregano, salt and peppa, a bit o' garlic.  Mama mia. That's good sauce.  My lunch this time around was an 8\" personal pie stacked with five toppings: breaded eggplant, roasted red peppers, red onions, roma tomatoes, and mushrooms. And a large fresh crispy spinach salad with mushrooms, onions, and almond slivers. Ever had salad on pizza?  So much green. So much red. It was like...Christmas."}
{"text":"I am typically a \"Chicago thin crust cut into squares\" type girl, but NYPD is my exception to the rule. I always get their Brooklyn Family pizza and add fresh garlic to it. It's delicious! They also have really really good ranch here. Good thing to note if you are a ranch snob like me and like dipping your crust into ranch!"}
{"text":"My first time eating here.   Service is GREAT (Thank you, Mark) - had Uptown wings and the Southwest Pizza.  OMG!!!  My favorite pizza from now on!  Thank you NYPD Pizza!"}
{"text":"Simple as this..... If you want some kick ass pizza and some bomb ass boneless wings that will make you rethink the best wings you've had, you need to come to NYPD Pizza!"}
{"text":"I must say I was very impressed by how the staff treated me. I came in 5 minutes before they were getting ready to close. I thought they closed at 10pm not 9pm. I ask if it was okay to still fine in and if not I wouldn't be offended and I totally understood. They we're so kind and said absolutely you can order and they didn't serve me attitude or give me the \"look\". A young lady named Mary Anne was extremely pleasant and made me feel comfortable and assured me I didn't need to rush but could sit and enjoy my pizza! She checked on me to make sure I was doing well and even gave me a to go cup for soda when I was ready to leave. Of course I ate faster than normal because I felt so bad but they were all so nice... I really appreciated their kindness after a long day... Good service is hard to find in Goodyear but I know where you won't be disappointed NY PD in Avondale! Very professional! Oh the pizza was perfect!!   Glenda"}
{"text":"Came here on a vacation and have never tasted a better pizza. Service was absolutely incredible. A bit pricey, but we definitely got what we paid for."}
{"text":"I am from NY and this is by far one of the best pizzas in the valley... I drive 20 minutes to get it.  They have the best water too!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza!!! We get almost every 2 weeks! And I like the way everyone greets you when you walk in the door!  By the way the lasagna is fantastic! On Tuesday it's buy one get one 50% off after 4 p.m. I'm not in love with the garlic knots but I crave this pizza!"}
{"text":"I love NYPD Pizza and this location!  The food and crew are amazing! We usually order takeout (pizza, wings and salads) and are always guaranteed to be made exactly as ordered. What sets this location apart is their amazing team. You're greeted by no less than three people by the time you end up at the takeout counter. The greetings aren't forced - the crew seems they enjoy interacting with customers and operate as a well-oiled machine - a rarity these days.   The pizza is delicious. We suggest ordering it a bit on the more well-done/crispy side - yummmm with a side of NYPD ranch. The hot wings (Hell's) are burn-your-nostrils hot. Hubs loves them, but I prefer the honey BBQ. Also, highly recommend the Soho salad that's served on top of their scrumptious pizza crust.   Overall, it's a great meal at a good price from an incredible team!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and up to par with any of the other NYPD restaurants. Unfortunately, my experience with the staff leaves much to be desired.   During football season, Thursday night is pizza night. Our family has a ritual - the last one heading home picks up pizza and wings...usually, it's me. Straightforward, right? Upon walking in, I'm usually given the once over by staff at the podium, then I'm ignored for a few minutes while idle chit-chat and horsing around continues. It's usually a process to get our order paid for and in hand. The last straw was when I was dressed down in front of staff and other customers for asking if someone could help me. We wouldn't recommend going to this location.   Save yourself some grief and head to the location down the road on Pima and Raintree (5 stars all the way!!). The Scottsdale Road team should take some lessons from the crew up there!"}
{"text":"Matt is by far one of the best managers I've ever met, great customer service. Made me feel right at home like I've known him for years."}
{"text":"I always loved NYPD. This newly renovated location is absolutely beautiful. Super clean, industrial and filled with friendly smiling faces! (Staff)   I ordered online for pickup, got lost getting there because of some construction in the plaza. Had to walk down a long way because the parking is blocked off.   The bartender greeted me and checked in my order. I seen her actually holding a wine glass to the light to check cleanliness. That was awesome to see!   The guy that was bagging my food was super nice, and checked for extra sauces.   Food tasted great. I do think there prices are a little on the higher side but worth it none the less!   Great lunch specials from 11-4!!  Edit: I was pretty pissed all you get is two lousy celery sticks but the food is too damn good to deduct a star!"}
{"text":"In addition to great food, NYPD has customer service down. I absolutely love their food, and despite inconsistent service I return because I'm a NY Native and It hits close to home.   After my recent negative experience and review the owner or manager reached out to me and offered to send me a dining certificate. $50 dollars for me and my husband to return.   I went back and had awesome service and food. They even reached out and asked if I had returned and if everything was good."}
{"text":"The pizza is really good. I'd give it 4 stars. Good sauce, the right amount of grease on the Brooklyn, and the crust is wonderful. The service, on the other hand, 2 stars. They forgot my order which really grinds my gears. The price is a solid 4 stars too. For airport food I didn't have to take out a loans to get a slice and a water. It was just $6 and change. If you're in Terminal 4 in the B gate area, stop in for some good pizza."}
{"text":"We were still on the quest for GOOD pizza, this time we were way out west and decided to try NYPD.  I was leary because it looks like a nice, respectable chain-style restaurant and I picture good pizza coming from a basic local pizza joint.  Well, we were pleasantly surprised by the pizza here, and yes, it is a nice, clean, pleasant restaurant.  We ordered a margherita pizza with tomatoes, basil and fresh mozzarella and were pleasantly surprised.  The crust was really delicious (must be that NY water) and the ingredients were fresh and proportioned just right.  We ordered it crispy (as suggested on menu) and it was delish.  We took some home and had some for breakfast, also good.  It will be the place we head to for pizza when on that side of town."}
{"text":"I orderfrom nypd regularly the past 2 times i ordered they forgot not one but 2 items from my order today i ordered they forgot my drinks and my sundae i received my order at 8 10pm was missing my drinks and sundae it is now 944 and have yet to receive my order i called and asked to speak with a manager the guy on the phone said there was no manager in the place and i could not speak with any he put me on hold i spoke with a lady next she promised to send my items out dont think i will be ordering from you at all again worse service ever bad customer service"}
{"text":"I'm from NY and we tend to be snobby about our pizza...but this place is GOOD. This review is simply for the pizza, not for the restaurant itself (we did take-out). Apparently this place ships in their water from the Motherland of Pizza, and apparently it makes all the difference. There's also something about their sauce that also hits the mark. I've ordered from this place 3 times now and have not been disappointed once. Even the size of their caesar salad was impressive, and definitely enough for 2.  Overall, quality pizza at a decent prize. NYPD is where it's at in PHX."}
{"text":"NY style pie on the in the West Valley  More of a Chicago-style pizza family, but we like NYPD Pizza.  Setting is an open, loud restaurant.  Ordering is quick, drinks arrive quickly, and the service is upbeat.  Pizza is actually very good-- too often, NY-style places are super oily and lack interesting flavor.  These folks don't commit those sins and you can taste your toppings.  Very good for groups.  Price is a tad high for pizza compared to the big chains.  All prices are going up these day though, and this is much better than a Pizza Hut, Domino's, or Pappa John's."}
{"text":"If you're ever in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and you hear people talking about a fantastic Pizza place in town, just assume they are talking about NYPD and never mind about that other pretentious Bianco place.   NYPD serves up some gigantic, cheesy, thin-crusted NY style pizzas.  These sizzling beauties are often large enough to fold or to eat with a fork/knife.  Their large pie for about $18 will feed 3 or 4 people.  Try the garlic cheese knots also.  Finally their salads are big enough to share.   Bottom line, good pizza at good price.  Service is good and you'll never be emaciated from waiting 2 hours to be seated."}
{"text":"The best Penne with Saysage.  Tory manager is awesome and Alicia the server fr Alaska is amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we stopped by this place - Shelby our waitress was super friendly and made some awesome suggestions about the menu - we had the Wall Street pizza and it was delish - tons of toppings - a great crust with perfect flavor and texture- I was blown away by the quality of the cheese the used as well. The cannoli was a real treat. I will for sure be coming back - I plan on taking advantage of their free kids night soon"}
{"text":"Ok, so I did a Motts pizza, and enjoyed it. I called in the order for take-out and picked up. Wait time was quoted as 25 minutes, so I showed up 25 minutes after the call. Sure enough, my pie was ready.  And barely warm.  Which begs the question... Did they just make it really fast & quote my time with a little \"cushion time\", or did they give me a Little-Ceasar-style premise one?... By the time I got home, the cheese was rubberized (you know how it gets on a pizza once it cools down), but the pie was still very tasty. So I gotta give props, but not a 5-er. The people were very friendly-5stars for the peeps. 3 for the pizza. Meetin' in the middle with 4."}
{"text":"Thick pizza, ok service, and urban decor.  FOOD No matter what you order, there will be plenty to go around. We order the thick pizza with an array of toppings. There was a little too much garlic on it for my liking. Because it was so thick, the dough didn't seem cooked all the way through.  It's nice if you want to build your own pizza. They have a large selection of toppings. You can also get pasta, panini, etc.   AMBIANCE The setting reminds you of being in the NYC subway- creative urban decor, setting was a little crowded on a Saturday night. If you have a party of two, request a booth. The table we were sat at was really small and smashed into a corner.   SERVICE Our server seemed a little distracted, though we overheard her say that she had worked there for 2 years- she still seemed somewhat inexperienced while attending to us."}
{"text":"I have so disappointed with NYPD Pizza. I order delivery about once a month. I am Italian and from NY. I ordered last night spent 20 minutes on the phone explaining I want the pizza well done not raw.  I explained the last 4 times I ordered, the pizzas were delivered raw.  So, the pizzas arrive and guess what, raw under cooked. So driver takes the pizzas back and said the manager personally make sure the pizzas will be well done and will return in about 40 minutes. Driver returns, one pizza done right, the second pizza raw under cooked. That is 5 times in 6 months. Driver even commented that I was a regular customer, that I had a NYPD shirt on and a NY Yankees logo on my curb.  So much for manager doing their job.  No call, no apology. Will never order from NYPD Pizza again and tell all my friends to stay away.  Very disappointed.  Terrible management awful customer service. Awful, just awful. Stay away from this pizzeria"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere for a lazy Saturday afternoon.  I came in because I saw the NYPD sign and was thrilled to see something about NY this far west. I read the yelp reviews to prepare myself and it seems like they are right on the money.  I was greeted and sat at the very small bar area, they sell beer and lots of Wine. I have enclosed a picture of the drafts and the bottles in the background. My server was very attentive and we socialized about the Baseball game and how I was a NY Yankee fan but they had the Bo Sox on the tv, she said she was a fan of the Patriots so that also made her a Red Sox fan, so I booed her. Gotta make her feel like she was at Yankee Stadium right?  I tried the Calzone  (pictured) it was perfect and only $5.5 for  small. The name of it was disappointing though, the AL Capone...Yes, Capone was a NY gangster at first but he is more well known for being a Chicago Gangster. They had plenty of Mafiso to name it after; Lucchese, Bonnano, Columbo, could have even called it the Dapper Don after John Gotti. Either way it was delicious... I was to full for dessert, to which they had cheesecake and cannolli my two favorite Italian desserts.  As I sat there eating my lunch, several families came in one after another,  all with children and some were babies. So, I'm guessing they have good kids food too."}
{"text":"The employees are kind, helpful, and pretty darn likeable. The food is nothing short of spectacular, but I wouldn't expect anything less from NYPD. This  is my new favorite lunch spot. Thanks for coming to arrowhead !!!! (Tiffany G. Needs a raise for her impeccable service and kindness)"}
{"text":"When I can't make my own, I order in from them. We are used to good pizza. We moved here from NYC, and have lived in Chicago and New Haven CT. The pizza here is as good as you'd get in any of those places, and the sides (like wings and salad) have been good every time we've ordered. I haven't eaten in the restaurant yet, but I have picked up the pies on my way home, and the place seems nice enough.  We've tried a few other places here in the valley, and were disappointed in some way by each of them. If you want a good pie, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Great food. I appreciate the thorough and prompt response I received regarding a customer service mishap at this location. The manager was very professional and patient, and reassured efficient service."}
{"text":"Great service and food. The staff is very cordial and the food is delicious.  The location is very convenient, just off loop 101."}
{"text":"Lindsay was our server and she was great! The pizza is fantastic, fresh herbs bring a new level of awesome to the pizza game. The beer is great, too! For those of you that are OCD, we posted a picture of the word search. Have fun finding what we couldn't ;)"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of NYPD for over 10 years.  They are consistently good and provide good service.  The BF and I have visited various locations this year including the one at the airport and they have all provided pizza with a great taste.  We enjoy the pizza dough/crust that is made with NY water.  We also learned that you can get the pizza dough to take home and make your own pizza.   At the last visit, we tried the fried fresh mozzarella.  I really enjoyed it.  The white pizza, brooklyn, and wall street are some of our favorites!"}
{"text":"I am in town at a hotel for work and needed to get delivery. The reviews talked about the great homemade dough and unlike other pizza delivery locations, they offered much better topping options. Fresh spinach, fresh garlic, and artichoke are all toppings I rarely see on most pizza joints. Delivery was quick and they were super friendly and smiled. I can't tell you how many delivery folks who are not when I answer the door! Tastes great!"}
{"text":"Our pizza was delicious and the service has always been on point for us. We alway get wings and are not disappointed. They should offer a Monday Night Football deal and add more TV's. Could be lucrative."}
{"text":"Yum!  The pizza at NYPD is awesome but first I have to rave about the garlic knots.  These little nuggets of joy are bread knots cooked to perfection and soaked in olive oil and garlic.    I've never actually gone for any of their specialty pizzas because I like pretty basic pizza -- cheese, pepperoni, black olives, etc.  You also have to try their cold cut sandwich.  My mom is part Italian and this reminds me of sub sandwiches that she used to make when I was a kid.    All in all it's a great dining experience and really good for families."}
{"text":"Came here with my family. It was great! Both the manager Nicole and our server Cherie were attentive and helpful. The food was great. I'm partial to Chicago style thin crust (I'm from Chicago so I'm biased) but this stuff was delicious."}
{"text":"This is the best Pizza EVER! We order it here at work all the time and everyone loves it. For dine in it is nice too, and at lunch they do two types of service... if you want to get your food and get out you can order at the counter and they call your number. If you want to be served, they have waiter service too. It is a bit pricey, $18 per large pizza but well worth it.  PS, They DO deliver as of a couple months ago.  My manager says \"MMMMMMMMMM\""}
{"text":"Becky was the BEST waitress. She was SO good with our daughter and even helped with her crossword puzzle . The food was phenomenal and everyone was so incredibly friendly. There needs to be a 10 star for this place . Thank you Becky'!!"}
{"text":"Have been many times. I have always been very satisfied with food and service. Last nights takeout was simply amazing."}
{"text":"Great food. Pizza is really good. One of my go to pizza places. Staff is always pleasant."}
{"text":"The vegan pizza! Yes, vegan. NYPD does a solid for vegans and the lactose intolerant. Couldn't get enough.  The large is enough to feed my husband and I for 2 days. The whole experience is customizable. My personal favorite is sautéed zucchini, mushroom, garlic, basil, & olives. Delivery took about 55 minutes on a Friday night. Delivery guy was so polite. The pizza was piping hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Great food worth the wait. The menu even tells you what items will take longer so no surprises. It just gives you more time to eat some cheesy garlic knots. Yummy."}
{"text":"While I am known to be obsessed with the Wall Street pizza, I love everything in the menu here. But the biggest thing about this place is the people that work there. I have been visiting or ordering delivery regularly and everyone here is just super customer focused and truly friendly. I tell you, I do feel like Norm from Cheers when I go there. This is a \"Do Not Miss\" eatery in central Phoenix. I will sorely miss you guys!"}
{"text":"Coming back from NYC a pizza snob, this place holds its own with me.  They say their secret is using NYC water (or at least water that's Ph balanced to match that of NYC; it's not coming in via tanker).  Whatever it is, I like it and I've got some other NYers to back me up.  Also high on the list are the garlic and cheesy knots.  My only complaints are that they serve Pepsi instead of Coke and that the ziti sauce can be a bit peppery sometimes."}
{"text":"So there's a new DOLLAR TREE coming to the Cheddars Shopping Center on Chandler Blvd @ the 101. I noticed the sign and pulled into the parking lot last night, only to see the COMING SOON sign in the window. It was dinner time, and NYPD is located in the same shopping center, so we decide to order take-out. We visit the state of New York often, and love the pizza. With a few extra dollars in my hand, (since the dollar tree isn't open) - the hubby and I decide to dine at NYPD. The atmosphere was charming, warm and intimate, but my BIGGEST KUDOS would be the staff. There were only 6 people working that evening, (besides the cooks) and I promise you, we must have met everyone.   NEW CUSTOMERS MEAN ALOT! I really don't know how else to put it. We were greeted with a smile upon entering the door by SHELBY. She tells us how the joint operates, hands us a menu and ushers us to the bar, to sit  & read the menu. Once at the bar, reading the menu, we are approached by the General Manager, MIKE -- he just wanted to make sure we have been helped and are indeed ordering take out, because there was plenty of room available in dining. I stood and went to the register to order our pizza and ERIC, was all cued up with the darling'est smile and most awesome customer service regarding  NYPD's  home made pizza crust, their toppings, and his knowledge of NY's Time Square and good pizza, (he also mentioned having family on the East Coast). The bartender JEREMY came over while we were ordering and started talking about drinks. We followed him back to the bar and ended up sipping FOURSQUARE: Peach and Pumpkin Pie beer. The pepperoni, black olive, fresh garlic pizza was beautiful in delivery, and absolutely tasty to the pallet. It's the closet you're going to can get to pizza in Times Square from Chandler, AZ.   FRESH INGREDIENTS TASTE BETTER! NYPD is all about fresh ingredients. When customer service is as fresh as the food you're being served -- you've got a WIN-WIN SITUATION and a opportunity to make a great dining memory in the process. The hubby and I WON on all fronts. Thanks Dollar Tree -- for leading me to NYPD PIZZA! I will be back."}
{"text":"I started coming to this restaurant a little over 4 years ago and my review was 5 star.  If I could give 10 stars for todays visit I would.  As usual the food was very good but our server, Elliott, was above and beyond and then some.  We were here to celebrate our mothers 83rd birthday.  He was so personable, friendly and funny.  We could not have enjoyed ourselves any more than we did and it is all because of Elliott!  Thank you for giving us such a special time with our mother!!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Bensonhurst which was an Italian area of Brooklyn, NY.  Back then, there was a pizzeria at every corner.  By blood I'm Puerto Rican, but my neighborhood made me an honorary Italian.  The decor and pizza brought me back home.  I am not a fan of their garlic knots, but the sauce was very good.  We got the Meat Lovers pizza and it was HUGE and delicious.  Well worth the $23 price tag.  Only complaint is that the bread seemed to fall apart.  Maybe they didn't leave it in the oven long enough.  We took 1/2 the pie home.  They seemed to be short-handed on staff so the service was slow.  When I ordered Cannoli, instead of giving us 2 they gave us a free 3rd one.  I have to admit....they were freakin good!  I'm kind of a Cannoli snob.  The only other good ones I've found in AZ were from Alexi's Grill on Central."}
{"text":"First time trying this location.  Went there with my wife and toddler to celebrate an early Father's Day.  Service was A+.  We had Bruschetta as an appetizer, Da Works pizza and Cannoli for desert.  Cannoli wasn't as good as I remembered.  One of these days I'll try to make them myself at home.  We all enjoyed our meal.  It was a little pricey, but well worth it considering we left full and had left overs.    Please note....this does not remind me of authentic NY Pizza.  Just being honest.  It's 'ok'."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  I know the positive:  our waitress Daniel was super sweet and could tell we weren't crazy about the food.    Pizza severely undercooked (after a long wait and not many people her, I should've known something was up) I specifically asked for crispy, BTW.  Garlic knots drenched in butter/oil and hardly cooked  Water tastes terrible, you could tell it's not filtered.   Daniel was sweet enough to credit our pizza without me even asking!  She's a huge asset to NYPD."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Now NYPD is #1 on my pizza list...need to see of there's one in so-cal! Quality is on point! Definitely coming back when visiting relatives in Az!"}
{"text":"NYPD never disappoints. I got the Brooklyn pizza and in a word \"amazing\".  I'm not sure what makes it so good. It's pepperoni, sausage, basil, cheese, and sauce.  I never order anything else."}
{"text":"This place is the pits.  I  would imagine NYC pizza would taste like their pizza if it was mailed to them via ground shipping then microwaved. In other words, their pizza is horrible.  I also had wings.  They were red in the middle.  I asked the server what what was about and he said they were not raw, they are pre cooked and flash fried.  He also said the quality of the meat is also the reason it's red.  I wish he just told me they were raw.  I should have known this place sucked when Oreganos next door has a hour wait and this crap hole has no one in it on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery while watching a movie.  They were friendly and their quote of 45 minutes to an hour wait was accurate. Probably not my favorite pizza but it was good.  First time customer, and I will be back."}
{"text":"Been coming here a bit just haven't reviewed in a while. Best dough in the Phoenix metro area. The garlic cheese knots are addictive. Pizza is melt in your mouth good. The Mott's Street is my favorite as it comes with pepperoni, sausage and meatball. Fried mozzarella is great. They service great desserts and have a full bar. Service is great, too."}
{"text":"Always love coming to NYPD. They make the best dough as it's soft and always tastes fresh. Any of their pizzas will suffice. The garlic knots with or without cheese are great as is the fried cheese. The cookie dessert and lemoncello cake are really good and are a nice way to end a meal here."}
{"text":"Time to re-review since it's been a while and I've been to this location multiple times since I've been here. Service is top notch, servers are very friendly and accommodating. Food is off the charts delicious. Garlic cheese knots are a must get. The lasagna is prob the best from any pizza joint and the pizza is great, too. The dough is chewy in a good way. Best dough I've had. Server didn't write down our large orders so he forgot our ranch and took a little longer than usual to ring us up. Other than that, love this place and you bet that I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"my wife and i went there last week and it was really good food and great service and love the new york decor"}
{"text":"Pretty good New York style pizza, which is my favorite.  Prices for both lunch and regular menu items are little bit pricey, but if you want some New York style pizza quick and delicious this place is worth a visit."}
{"text":"This place is a consistently great pizza joint. Even busy, service is top notch. The pizza is fresh and good. Lots of vegetarian options and even vegan cheese is a choice. Also have gluten free. A couple of tvs and a bar with decent selections, about 6 taps. I've done carryout and done in, both great. Kids eat free weds/sun. Mozzarella is really good. So is the bruschetta pizza. All the staff is very friendly and welcoming, feels like a place that can be the go to homey pizza place!"}
{"text":"Had a good lunch at NYPD Pizza. Had to try their new fried mozzarella. They were actually square shaped. I've never seen that before. They fell apart a little bit as we ate them because they are hand breaded and the juices were leaking out onto our hands. But they were good with the marinara. Not really seasoned, just simple. Pricey though... $7.99 for 3 squares! We ordered a medium 16\" pizza with half pepperoni, half cheese. I liked that the crust was thin, yet soft. Sprinkled on some parmesan & oregano for added flavor. Good pizza. Our server was attentive and kept our drinks refilled. A $30 lunch for two isn't cheap, but we enjoyed it and had leftovers to take home, so I'm happy."}
{"text":"Met my dad here for lunch. I like their food but it's on the pricey side so I don't eat at NYPD Pizza very much. We got the 6 count honey BBQ boneless wings for an appetizer. When they came out they looked like little meatballs... Kinda sad looking, but they tasted good. And we got 7. I liked the sauce. We got a large 18\" pizza, half pepperoni, half cheese. The pepperoni half was super greasy, but the cheese side was quite tasty. Good place, but like I said, not cheap."}
{"text":"I went here again and found out I could get the chicken parmesan made how I want it.  I got it sautéed and it was much better."}
{"text":"Pizza was great! Our server Keith was a delight- very friendly and helpful! He was even good with our 4 yr old!"}
{"text":"This review is based on a take out and not a dine in experience.   When called to place the order, staff was friendly and answered any questions we had about the order and specials.  Pick up time was given as 20 minutes.  We opted for pick up as we wanted to avoid the charge for delivery.  Yes, there is a small charge for delivery despite living less than 5 minutes away but that's okay. When we got there, there were lots of parking spaces and we were able to pull right up to the front of the restaurant.  Immediately walking in, I was greeted courteously.  Staff was friendly and had smiles on their faces.  Pick up is at the back of the restaurant so I had to walk through the restaurant which looked clean and well lit. Picked up the pie and it was excellent.  Crust wasn't too large and neither was it over baked nor too thin.  The pie wasn't greasy or oily.  Vegetables and toppings was fresh including the cheese which was stringy and hot!  The medium that we ordered looked like a large and even though it was only for two, it survived a couple days and even then, when it was cold, it still tasted fresh when reheated! Definitely a place I'll be returning to try some of their other items and speciality pizzas."}
{"text":"Great spot stopped in by myself for a quick early dinner was nice to see the had pizza by the slice all day (most places stop after lunch) got a couple slices one sausage one meatball service was fast pizza was great nice and crispy good amount of sauce and cheese and the toppings covered the slice. I will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"The pizza here is solid, living in New York before, I have a reference point.  I love the oil that drips down in the middle of the pizza when it's folded...Yummmmmm! That's surely the money maker and that's why I keep coming back. Service is always on point, you can always expect a smile, and greeting each time you come here. Everyone seems like they like their job here. The house salad is pretty basic,  but when you add the homemade Balsamic dressing, it is soo good. I have not tried anything else on the menu,  but I am certainly open and anticipating. Will Def go back, and if you love good pizza...then this is your spot. They do have other locations in the valley,  so check it out"}
{"text":"Kids liked the traditional pie, and I loved the gluten free option! I did have them bake the gluten free pizza in the regular oven as recommended by another review. We will be back Thanks Phil G for your review, it helped"}
{"text":"Every time I've ever been here for lunch or with a friend the service has been timely and friendly. I've order simple slices to go and full pizzas. The mix drinks are yum! I usually try whatever drink my server recommends and I'm never disappointed. Love the remodel and booths that have been put in."}
{"text":"Best Vegan pizza in the West Valley! I've had their vegan pizza, the Veganizza, three times and have loved it every time. I also recently learned that they can make almost any pizza vegan by substituting Daya cheese instead of the mozzarella. I've done both carry out and dined in and have had a fantastic experience all times."}
{"text":"I love this place. They are always accommodating of weird requests and treat my 4 yr old daughter great!  This is my favorite pizza in Chandler!  The interior has NYC themed subway markings, street signs, and even apartment windows. Sure, it's a little cliche, but its nice that its a casual place with great food.  This place is family friendly and their servers always make my 4 yr old daughter feel welcome.  They have always accommodated our weird requests.  She loves pepperoni and we regularly request a side dish of the stuff.  They send out a ton for us and it makes her so happy!  NYPD has NYC style pizza that is large, soft, and reasonably thin.  It's best eaten by folding in half, of course.  This is easily my favorite style, even through I enjoy brick oven thin crust and Chicago style.  I will say that most times I simply order a slice or 2 of cheese pizza and venture off to pizza heaven.  The sauce and cheese are great and the quality speaks for itself with the first bite.  That being said, I've tried almost all the specialty pizzas here and really enjoy all of them.  The Pesto, The Big Kahuna, and Margherita are all favorites with my family.  I clearly pay extra to go here vs. other pizza joints, but I happily part with my hard earned money for a slice of NYPD pizza and a cold beer.  Speaking of which, they have a great selection on tap and in bottle.  I've always been able to find something I like and they even have some AZ local beers to try.  Value - 4/5 Service - 5/5 Atmosphere - 4/5 Food - 5/5 Beer - 5/5"}
{"text":"Be warned the balsamic salad dressing isn't always made correctly because it's hand mixed, sometimes with more oil than anything else making your salad a greasy mess. But when it is mixed correctly it tastes amazing!! Our server Tanya, was extremely polite and suggested if you go through the express lane everything is done fast so the dressing isn't always mixed properly. Ask for a spoon in case this happens, then all you have to do is spoon off any excess oil that has collected at the top of your dressing cup, keeping your salad from looking like it's drenched in nothing but oil."}
{"text":"Ice Cold zucchini appetizer. Been here before it was good. But this ruined it for me. Makes me think none of it is fresh. Our server Natalie was great and apologized more than once and also took care of it. Limoncello cake it's really good."}
{"text":"Dependable NY style pizzeria.  Great lunch specials.  Slices are good with good variety."}
{"text":"The only thing resembling NY pizza at this place is the name. The pizza is like any other chain joint across the country. As former NY'ers we decided to give it a shot. The first time the pizza was mediocre at best. The second time my husband and I got food poisoning. Needless to say that was enough for us to say never again!! There are actually a couple of decent pizza places in the Gilbert / Queen Creek area. This is not one of them."}
{"text":"Food is good for the most part. The employees could care less if your there however. Stood at the door watching the host and waitress flirt near the bar. Finally gave up and sat ourselves. Still no attention from a server so my wife walked to the counter to order. That finally got someones attention! We got some sodas and ordered our food but to our disappointment multiple people came in, ordered after waiting to be seated and got their food before us. I guess if you seat yourself and put your own order in they no longer consider you a good customer or something because it sure felt like no body cared about our experience. Only way we got a drink refill was to flag down the waitress.  Bad experience service wise but its what we have grown accustomed to at this location. Take my advice and just order delivery."}
{"text":"Doug the driver was very polite and had some great dialogue with my daughter. Pizza was fantastic as always and will order from them every time."}
{"text":"Unbelivable pizza!!! We got the the Brooklyn medium, and it was huge! Crust was perfect.  Service was fast. Nice rekax environment.  Will definiely be back!"}
{"text":"What a great place for pizza. The service and food was awesome. Our waitress Denitsa was absolutely wonderful. We will be returning very soon again. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is REALLY good - NY style done right with a huge pie, thin crust and cheese that is not burnt - a rare treat for pizza outside of NY/NJ.  The sicilian pizza is also terrific. The only reason I took away a star is because the service is inconsistent. We almost always wait here longer than other restaurants and always get the feeling they forgot about us.  However, if you're with good company, have a few beers & don't worry about it - the pizza is worth the wait."}
{"text":"The white tomato, Sicilian and plain cheese are some of the best pizza I've ever had.  The white tomato is by far my favorite, but I've never had a bad slice from this place.  Great for take out and even better for grabbing a slice at lunch."}
{"text":"I love NYPD! This is a little small place right on mill but I love it. Its got this funky crossword puzzles on the wall and a great little bar in the center with two big tvs in the middle.   Never had white pizza before and our waiter Cole did not let us down with it. We paired it Greek salad and it was the perfect amount for my boyfriend and I to share for date night.   Last but not least we took the plunge and got dessert (which we never do). Tried the San gennaro zeppolis. Remind me of like a French donut! Would recommend these if you still have room. Found my new pizza place on mill."}
{"text":"The food was deserving of 5 stars (FANTASTIC!)  but the server was a mute until time to pay the bill and then suddenly he can talk.  Very annoying!  He brought our drinks, took our order, returned to clear the table and said NOT A SINGLE WORD and just GRABBED up everything from the table like it was some big problem.  He brought our pizza out and didn't light the candle to keep our pizza warm. He did refill our drinks and did do all you expect as far as getting what we need but it felt uncomfortable/awkward and all of us noticed it. It wasn't actually the fact that he didn't say anything, it was that we could just FEEL that attitude.  We all felt like we were experiencing the silent treatment.  LOL!  We have always had exceptional service and food each and every time we have been to NYPD but normally we dine at the Chandler location and so maybe it is just this location.  I would recommend taking your food TO-GO and NOT to dine in at this location if service is important to you.  Again, the food was fantastic and deserving of 5 stars."}
{"text":"When I walked in I was greeted by an employee who was across the large building. Employee tried to ask if I was carrying out but expected me to yell across the building. When I walked up to the register he asked if I wanted a slice. I noticed two pizzas in the window one had a very clearly used pizza holder sitting on top of the pizza. He told me that was the only pizza to order from and it had what could have been a dirty pizza pan holder on top of it which the bottom touches the tables and so on which forced me to order a small pizza instead of a slice so I didn't get a dirty pizza. Employee seemed unhappy when I pointed out the pan never should have been on top of pizza.... That is a health risk for customers placing dirty stuff on top of a pizza. I could see the pan had been used from the residue on it"}
{"text":"If you order delivery, make certain you confirm the delivery time. Big problem, especially if you are hungry or have guests. Typically, we have been told to expect 45 minutes to an hour. So, we plan ahead. This time, we were told an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes. When we had nada at an hour and twenty minutes, I called and was informed that the delivery times had changed to 75 to 90 minutes. I asked to speak to a manager, and was on hold until I hung up 4 minutes later. Not great customer service, especially with so many good competitors (Bianco's, Parlor) so close. Not delivery, but not an hour and a half with some BS thrown in, either."}
{"text":"Legit NY style pizza. This is the best stuff out here in AZ if you're from NY and know good NY pie. This is it.  The reviews do not match the quality of the slices. Stop in for a slice or two of cheese only. That's how you judge a place. Very good was my experience."}
{"text":"Ordered last night at 8:15pm. Requested delivery only 2.5 miles away. They said \"You are next\" and didn't get the pizza for 55 minutes and when it arrived it was barely warm.  It was soggy and squished and just not the best pizza.  Thin crust was okay, but I've definitely have had better pizza, I don't think we got the mushrooms, the pepperoni and salami was not familiar and just overall blah.  Wouldn't have it again."}
{"text":"My family goes here almost once a week and we love it. The staff is super friendly and nice to our young son. I love all their salads and my picky pizza eater husband loves their pizza."}
{"text":"went there again to use the coupon that the manager arturo carbrales had sent me because of the bad experience we had there previously , and the food and service were great , very attentive pizza was good and just total redemtion on their part , thank you arturo we will be returning"}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza in town! We have lived here for over a year found this place last night and couldn't believe we finally found a good pizza place!!! First time ordering and it won't be the last!"}
{"text":"This experience is based on a take out order. After 2 years of avoiding NYPD, we thought we would give them another chance. Should have waited another 2 years. Arrived early, and they said it would be about 6 more minutes. After waiting for about 12 minutes finally went to check on the order. Both pizza and wings were sitting on top of the oven. Poor communication. Got home anticipating good pizza and wings. Wrong. Wings were chicken particles, and wouldn't consider them boneless wings. Pizza was the Joey's Favorite. It had no flavor and was under cooked. Another disappointing meal at NYPD. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I were n town for the Super Bowl we stopped n here. It was so much more than we expected. Pizza was so yummy and the Antipasto was delicious. We had to order more to take to  to the family!"}
{"text":"This is not, in fact, the NY style pizza you are looking for BUT it is a solid tasty lunch spot. They've got decent lunch specials and it's usually not too busy so they're fast. Wouldn't recommend this place for dinner though, it looks pricey and if the pizza tastes the same at dinner, likely not worth it."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings. Kind of crazy they charge you for a side of blue cheese with the wings. I understand charging for extra but most places give you one cup included. Just thought that was odd. The salads and appetizers aren't impressive."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love the pizza here. Hands down my local favorite. Service? Not so much. Ordered a pizza for pick up at 5:20pm on a friday night, was told 30-35 minutes. Well its 6:20pm now and still no pizza. Manager tells me, \"well, its Friday night... want a drink or something?\" I just want my pizza. If they would have told me 1hr I would have come then. Now I sit in my car with hungry bored kids."}
{"text":"This rating is based solely on the service, or complete lack thereof, I experienced today. It is not about their food, as we left before I could taste any pizza.  Since it was during lunch (and they weren't overly crowded), I approached the counter to order (as I've been able to do during lunch at their other restaurants). The little girl took my order for a couple slices and then completely disappeared, without completing the order or collecting any money. Another waitress approached the cash register where I was standing and didn't greet me, make eye contact or even attempt to let me know someone would be with me shortly. She just proceeded to input what I assumed were some of her tickets from other patrons already seated in the dining room. There was a guy working the next cash register. He too failed to offer any type of friendly greeting, instead choosing to answer the phone. I've always been taught that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, in other words, help the customer standing in front of you and ask the customer on the phone to please hold. I decided they weren't going to get any of our business today.   As I was leaving, a woman behind the counter in a white top made eye contact with me, but failed to ask if there was anything she could help me with. The original server with whom I'd placed my order was just coming back in from helping a customer carry 3 pizzas to their car. She looked at me with a glimmer of recognition that I was the customer she'd left stranded at the counter, but she made no attempt to rectify the situation..  We won't return. My son was crestfallen, as he had his little 3 year-old heart set on pizza and was crying. However, when I explained to him he'd done nothing wrong and we were going to get much better food and treatment at a neighboring restaurant, his normal good mood was quickly restored."}
{"text":"3 or 4 stars? They're definitely capable of 4 or more and this time was a 3.5 so I'll go with 4. To start the guy on the phone was really personable and friendly, I think that's important. I ordered delivery and could definitely tell there's a lot of potential but it just didn't quite add up on this occasion. The pizza ingredients were fantastic! I had the NYPD Blue and added mushrooms too it, great tasting pizza! My only problem was it was a little on the cool side and should've been a bit hotter. The wings were a definite no go... not much meat and overcooked. I don't think I'd be ordering them again. To follow up my delivery guy was very friendly when he delivered my food."}
{"text":"Everything the same but the quality of the pizza. Some parts were burnt, waitress told us the thin crust was supposed to be like that, I'm like not at the Gilbert location we usually go to, really wanted to like this location since it's so close to the in laws house... Anyhoo.. We ate, laughed, and paid. Not the best experience but still left satisfied. The wings here aren't to par of what we are used to at the other location.   Parking is kind of scarce. There's some in the front but limited and in the back but you gotta keep your eyes open or someone will beat you to it!"}
{"text":"My family's fave restaurant to sit down and eat in! The food is great, we ask for extra thin extra cheese pepperoni pizza and its cooked to perfection every time! Cheesy garlic knots are a must try and the servers are always friendly and knowledgeable with what's on the menu!  Restaurant is clean and has a cool NY feel to it even here in the desert. My daughters love the pizza bites and they get a dessert with it as well! All smiles from my family at this spot!  Parking ia good, when they get busy you might have to wait a while but trust me it's worth it! :0)"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite little lunch spot when I'm in PV. I highly recommend the Chelsea Chopped Salad! Also, service is always great and everyone is friendly."}
{"text":"We needed to try a new pizza place and phone a take out order tonight from NYPD. Order was ready right when i Arrived, Staff was friendly and assisted me right away. I ordered the fried zucchini, mozzarella, house salad, regular pizza and a half Sicilian pizza. Everything was FABULOUS! Their marinara was delicious as was their ranch. I loved the thick Sicilian crust. We will definitely go back and eat in next time. I'm looking forward to trying their pasta!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!! I ordered a meal that cost me about $30 after the delivery fee.  The food was disgusting!!! It was overcooked, and the Styrofoam had even melted.  During the order, I asked them to replace marinara sauce with alfredo sauce for the Chicken Parmagiana - and it was smothered but tasted gross!!  I also got zucchini sticks, and they were all soggy.  I will NEVER order from this place again, because after the 1 hr. 15 minute wait, I was highly disappointed. I would not recommend ordering online, or even eating there for that matter."}
{"text":"As I eat my way through the menu, my opinion of NYPD has not changed.  The sandwiches are good. The calzones are also tasty (but heavy on the ricotta, which I know some people don't like). Baked ziti is still as delicious as ever. And they make a mean caesar dressing. Yum!  NYPD has also added and expanded delivery since my last review. There's a fairly large minimum order for it to be free, but if you're lazy then you probably don't care."}
{"text":"My family and I were deciding what to eat for dinner the other night and as usual, we were taking way too long to decide. Everyone was asking each other what sounded good and yet...no one really agreed with each other. When it was my turn to add my \"two cents\" I decided that a bowl of spaghetti and hot wing sounded better than anything! After a pause...the fam said, \"Ok, but where could they have both?\" Then they started spouting out, \"How about Buca?\" \"BJ's?\" \"Native New Yorker?\" \"Buffalo Wild Wings?\" Albeit all sounded yummy, but there was just something off.   So I started looking here on Yelp for \"spaghetti\" or \"wings\" and one of the first things that popped up was this place - NYPD Pizza. I opened up the menu and browsed through the posted pictures and I was sold! So we all got into the car and took off. Now mind you...it took all of us over an hour to finally decide where to eat! With 6 strong-opinionated people in the family, it can get overwhelming!  Anyway...YUM! Food was so good and totally satisfying! We ordered the 12pc \"Upstate\" wings and the fried zucchini for apps. Wings are awesome with just the right amount of acid and hotness (and also not too hot for the youngins), but next time I want to try the \"Hell's Kitchen\" wings! The zucchini was alright - typical wedges to dip in ranch, not memorable. Entrees were pretty well proportioned, even the kids' meals of spaghetti and meatballs were huge! I also ordered the spag/balls and it was yummy, but could not even finish it, so I boxed the rest for home to eat the next day. Hubs ordered a small \"Brooklyn\" pizza (Pepperoni, sausage and fresh basil) Sicilian-style...I had a bite and I'm ordering that one next time. What a great pie! My eldest, ordered the Chicken Parmigiana...that was a boat! He had 2 breaded chicken breasts (or one really big one!) that was served with spaghetti and covered in marinara sauce and mozzarella. I wish I took a picture of that, the thing could've fed him and my 9 and 11 yr old! He too boxed that one up for a yummy leftover lunch the next day. Did I mention the garlic knots? Well I will now! They are buttery and garlicky with a little crisp edge all around. I'm glad I had 1/2 of one because I wouldn't have been able to eat my entrée! They serve 3 with the spaghetti and 3 with the chicken parm. Next time for sure, we'll go at lunch time to check out the really good deals they have and we'll try the calzones (they say it takes about 20 minutes to make), the \"SoHo\" salad (salad on top of pizza crust) and the Turkey Focaccia Sandwich.  We're definitely going back for some more good eats! Service was great when we went and definitely family friendly. I dug the vibe! Thanks NYPD!"}
{"text":"I am visiting from out of town and was craving pizza.  Stumbled upon this place and the pizza was DELICIOUS.  I also ordered their crispy mozzarella and it was unbelievably good.  The balsamic reduction was absolutely delicious.  We ordered the Brooklyn (I think that's what it's called), it comes with pepperoni,  sausage, basil.  We added black olives to it.  All I can say..... I wish they had one in Charlotte NC where I live."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the pizza crust was amazing. Maybe my expectations were too high coming in based on all of their radio advertising. It was a very good pizza, dont get me wrong. There was just something missing that I cant put my finger on. I just did not have that OMG reaction when I took a bite. Not much seating, so get there early."}
{"text":"We have ordered our last pizza from here.  When NYPD first opened in Phoenix it was the perfect New York pizza that I love - cheesy and a little greasy, great.  But through the years it has gone downhill and the prices have gotten ridiculous.  $26 for a medium pizza - way to high.  The pizza was delivered on time but the toppings were skimpy with VERY little cheese even though we asked for extra cheese.  Hope another New York style pizza places opens up cause this place is terrible."}
{"text":"The customer service team at the Resturant was apologetic and offered a refund.  Now a satisfied consumer!  Thanks"}
{"text":"I've only ever tried the Brooklyn (pepperoni, sausage and basil), particularly because it was so amazing.  I moved to NYC last year, and I have yet to find a pizza as good as the Brooklyn at NYPD Pizza.  Pretty ironic, right?  My girlfriend and I are often disappointed each time we try a new place that doesn't quite live up to NYPD, we look forward to getting this again once we visit Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Great pizza with a superb hand-tossed dough crust! We got fried zuchinni as an appetizer and we all loved it! Even my picky toddlers. Then we got a medium pizza and that sucker was HUGE!! Great sauce and dough. The crust was thin, New York style. Our waitress was awesome too and always made sure our drinks were filled and that we we had everything we needed. We will definition return since we had a great experience."}
{"text":"Awful. Almost no cheese, and what was on it was barely covering the tip of the slice. Incredibly grumpy staff. I should have walked to another concourse but I didn't have much time. Concourse B1-14 is the orphan concourse now; so many better options for food in other concourses. Well, at least the slice was hot."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic NYC pies. I can't recommend this place enough. the staff is always helpful and sweet. Garlic knots and cannoli are a must try :)"}
{"text":"We had Mark! It was great service and great pizza! The boneless wings were amazing. The cheese pizza was the perfect combination of pizza sauce and cheese. Definitely a great spot to stop to eat when leaving the airport!"}
{"text":"Good food. Service not great. Always mess up something on my orders. Tonight was worst. Messed up order but did not give me a credit. Then I was carrying 2 big pizzas and bag so hands full going out door. Delivery girl walked in door right past me and door closed in front of me. A young guy coming in was nice enough to hold door. I am appalled."}
{"text":"I love pizza and I love the pizza here. Delivery is a nice touch. Try the meatballs on your next pizza.   Fact: NYPD has their water filtered so it's exactly like the eater in Yonkers."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Received a great message from a manager apologizing for my issues and offering to make it right. No need to make anything right, just get better from this opportunity. Thanks for taking about your customers.   First time trying this pizza. I'm visiting on business and ordered pizza, and salad to the hotel.  The delivery lady was very polite. When I opened up my bags, there was no silver/plastic ware. When you are delivering to a hotel, you should assume that the person at a hotel doesn't have utensils to eat the salad with! Also, my bottled water was warm. Pizza was okay.  Overall, not impressed."}
{"text":"*Updated*  My boyfriend and I had recently had some consistent lower quality service at NYPD.  We have since then been contacted by management who has taken the time to address our concerns and earn back our business.  I will say, that NYPD probably has one of the best management teams that I have ever been contacted by.  It shows how much they care about their business when they are willing to take the time out to make things right with their usual customers.  I haven't found a place quite like NYPD with such a great taste and NY feel, from my past experiences, and I certainly hope that the past few will not define their normal quality of service."}
{"text":"This is like 2 stars for the price and food but the lady on the phone and the ladies at the pickup counter/front door were extremely nice, friendly and courteous (held the door open for me which I appreciated) so they get an extra star themselves.  I always appreciate and enjoy good service!   I had a long drive home from CA and didn't feel like making anything.  I was craving some pizza and wanted to try something kind of close to home.  I placed my order for pickup and drove on down.  I ordered a Large Cheese Pizza.  Price was a bit steep...$19.15 after tax and that is just plain cheese....if you got some toppings, it would easily be a $25.00+ pizza.  Um....I'll pass!  The pizza was flavorful....good sauce, good cheese but the dough/crust was kind of whack.  The bottom of the pizza was not crispy or browned at all.  It was super white and doughy which wasn't that good.  The actual crust was ok.  It had a decent chew/texture to it. Probably could have been cooked a bit longer overall though as far as the bottom..  The pizza is pretty large and I only ate 2 slices for dinner and was full...plenty of leftovers.  For $19.00 though, I will probably pass going forward.  It definitely wasn't nasty, but the under cooked/soft bottom of the pizza and the steep price tag left me wanting more.  The only time I see myself coming back is when they have deals or coupons or something...even then, I would rather drive to some of my other favorite spots than come back here when I am craving a pizza."}
{"text":"Went with a large group after our boys played a baseball game. Called day before and ordered pizzas for all the boys. The boys Pizza came out quickly and perfectly - this is what the 1 star is for. The adults in the party (which they also knew we were coming in advance) waited 2 HOURS for our food to arrive. The waitress claimed to have forgotten to put in our order??!! Really?! She had one job. As the food was starting to coming out for some of our party it was incorrect and we were still waiting. We ended up cancelling our order after waiting over 2h with nothing. Complete disappointment. Maybe the pizza was good - we will never know. The service was so bad we never got to eat any of it."}
{"text":"My family has always liked NYPD Pizza and this location in Gilbert near the San Tan mall is a good spot.  The restaurant itself gets VERY busy on the weekends so we tend to call our order in an pick it up instead of waiting in line for a table, but during the week it's easy enough to get a seat quickly.  The service in the restaurant when we do dine in has always been fine, never over the top amazing, but good enough.  It's exactly what I would expect from this type of restaurant.  We usually start by ordering the cheesy garlic knots (whether we're dining in or picking up) because they are amazing.  My 18 month old son also loves them (he loves anything that is made of bread) and it's a nice way to keep him occupied while we wait for our pizza to come out.  Pizzas generally take 15 to 20 minutes to come out which is what I would expect and they always taste good.  I really like the sliced sausage they have available instead of the crumbled sausage.  Sliced sausage is flat and more similar in size to pepperoni... only, a little bit longer and not quite as round.  My wife's grand mother always orders the spaghetti and meatballs which she loves and ends up taking the left overs home for lunch the next day.  Overall, NYPD Pizza is a nice place to go if you're looking for a family friendly atmosphere with a very understandable and approachable menu."}
{"text":"I usually get my order delivered. They are prompt and accurate with my order. I just like a small pizza with onions and extra sauce. Their ranch is excellent for dipping. Get a side of that!"}
{"text":"We've been here many times before and the food is always excellent. However, tonight the service was very slow. It took an hour for the food to come out, with no word from the waiter until about 5 minutes before the pizza came out. We did get seated right away, but after us, there was no hostess and there was a backup of people waiting to be seated. The restaurant wasn't even that busy. Assuming they were short staffed. Overall, food was awesome--the service not so much."}
{"text":"So I had never been to a NYPD before and they just opened on Mill so I decided to check it out. Ordered a small pizza half cheese half pepperoni and with great service we were served food... and was told that because the pizza was slightly a different shape because of being put against the back of the oven that we were being brought another one free of charge. Talk about good service! And the pizza itself was good.... it is a little bit on the expensive side, but I guess average for a sit down pizza place."}
{"text":"Bartender was only talking to men dressed nice and gave no attention to us. The \"garlic knots\" are not garlic knots.... the are cheap dinner biscuits similar to Hawaiin rolls"}
{"text":"I really like the pizza here plus they have a great menu full of salads, calzones and other goodies. I have never been disappointed in anything I have ordered. One time they didn't have something I wanted on the menu so at the end of our meal they surprised my family with a free dessert which was amazingly good."}
{"text":"Brought my family in for dinner after a very stressful day!! Enjoyed our dining experience with John our waiter!! Made our girls laugh and brought smiles to their faces!! All the staff were very nice and courteous!! They worked well as a team and made sure our time was great here. We have been coming here for years and well we for sure continue to return!! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I went to this location twice, the first time everything was amazing. Really good, fresh strawberry salad and realllly good pizza. The second visit my strawberry salad was definitely lackluster but the pizza was still pretty good. We will probably come back for the pizza but I won't order the salad again. Since I don't go out for pizza often we probably won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!! Being from the east coast I have been dying for good food and I have finally found a pizza meeting my satisfaction. Love, love, love it!"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good, we love it!  I did not like the salad, it was prepackaged and dry, not freshly chopped on premises.  A bit of a drive for us, but the pizza alone is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"NYPD Pizza is the best pizza downtown!  I work in the area and absolutely love the lunch special:  a slice of pizza and a side salad for under $7.00 is amazing!  Lanae who works the front line is fantastic!  Stopped in today around lunch time and the place was packed but she treated my friend and I so well, with amazing customer service and gave us the best slice of pizza!  Keep up the good work Lanae!"}
{"text":"Decided to try NYPD on a Groupon.  The pizza was mouth watering GOOD ! Extremely thin crust is available.  We loved the Pesto Chicken and White pizza equally. The service, however, is what really impressed us.  The server was very friendly, attentive and checked back often.  The Manager came by twice and chatted us up. He let us know about all the nightly specials they run.  He also invited us back with a special free app offer. We were quite impressed with all the personal attention we received. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"We tried the new online ordering system they offer for delivery. We placed the order in at 4:23pm, the system generated a delivery time of 5:08 pm. We waited at 5:23pm I called to see the status and check in to make sure my order was placed. They stated it was just about the leave the building. I waited and called back at 5:40 pm they stated the driver was out for 12 minutes and the pizza should be there any minute, so we waited. At 6pm I just had enough and decided to go to Taco Bell, I called back to cancel the order. The manager of the store came in the line and was very apologetic and understanding. She really turned the Customer services experience around. She let us keep the order for FREE! It was a $60 order! I know it's not their fault but when you have guest over waiting to eat, you just start getting frustrated. I appreciate them taking ownership of the situation, and we will be back! Thank you NYPD."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. And now for the nitty gritty,  I have been ordering from this location for almost 3 yrs. It is one of my go to places for really good pizza. The size and price for the pie is just right. The crust.....OMG! Yea I used that word, is really, really good. On the day that we went to eat in and the time this photo was taken was April 30th 2016 around 2pm. Our server was very friendly and polite and was attentive to our needs. My needs were making sure the Corona's were never empty (It was a long day with the little kids and one has to unwind :) Don't worry, I only had two!) anyway, The pizza was awesome as was the service. I would knock a star off but this is a rating on the food and service which were both outstanding. Oh, the knocking off of a star.... well, If you have T-Mobil as your service provider, be prepared to be thrown back to the days without a cell phone as you cannot get service inside. I spoke to the server and manager about this and they both agreed. I told them having a wi-fi service in this location would be a great idea. I hope you enjoy the pizza as much as me and my family has for over the past 3 yrs."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza of all time! The food is always good. The garlic cheese knots are amazing, the pizza is always fresh and they have a large selection of toppings. Everything is kept clean and orderly. The staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. I walked in ordered a chicken parm and said that I was going to go sit at the bar and have a beer while  was waiting on my food... No one was working the bar. One server was working the floor. I was not greeted. I had to approach the manager and ask if there was anyone working the bar. She said yes and that they would be right with me. Then she went back to running her report. I continued to wait at the bar. My food came but the individual was too young and couldn't serve me a beer. After another five minutes the server working the floor came and asked if I was going to want a drink... Again very disappointed. The employees here don't care and it is because management doesn't care... So, I won't care.  Avoid this place, unless of course you want mediocre food at best and want to be treated with an extreme amount of indifference."}
{"text":"We have been ordering pizza from NYPD for years... excellent every time!  never a disappointment like STREETS of NEW YORK.... we have had MANY bad experiences with them... but never NYPD.  Great Staff & good food... Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"We just tried this place for the first time. The pizza was good and reasonably priced. We had the Bobby-Que and pepperoni. We ate in the restaurant and the staff was friendly. The pizza took a little longer to make than normal, but they were probably just busy. I definitely would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good pizza."}
{"text":"I miss the \"special pizza\" from back east. Someone called it that once while in LA and it made me laugh. Anyone that's enjoyed a slice in the tri-state area understands how important pizza is to New Yorkers. (Sorry New Jersey and surrounding states. I'm from New York!)  You can walk into almost any pizza joint, ask for a slice and be happy with your two buck piece of cheesy gooey heaven on (slightly) crunchy dough. No need for production value to enjoy good pizza. Moving to the west side of the U.S. I don't miss the cold weather, but I do miss pizza.  CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS WOULD BE PROUD I've found good pizza last night. No, GREAT pizza. (Well, technically I did nothing. My date did. But he did well! Thank you Yelp!)  ORDER | PICKUP Our pie had pepperoni, sausage and basil. \"We\" ordered online and the pie was ready for pick-up at the scheduled time. The staff was delightfully polite and cheerful. Cute place inside, filled with booths and tables. I like that there is plenty of bar space to cozy up to as well. We had no time to enjoy a drink as our pie was ready to go!  TRAVELS WELL I can't begin to tell you the dismay of traveling with something that smells so heavenly in a car. (\"Will it be ok?\" \"Can I scarf a slice before we get there?\" and so on. But we had to hit BevMo. Priorities!)  With glee I can report NYPD Pizza travels well. My palate was BFF with the two slices I scarfed down. (Yup, no lady like behavior there.)  FOOD HIGHLIGHTS + Not greasy + Not salty + Crunchy dough + Added bonus: Microwaves well the next day.  I'm dreaming of my next visit!"}
{"text":"On a recent vacation in Phoenix, my wife and I ate at NYPD pizza TWICE, that's how impressed we were. We're originally from New York (the Bronx, myself), and unapologetic about being a NY pizza snob. We found out about this place while eating at the NY Bagel & Bialy (also excellent) across the street for breakfast when we asked about local / nearby NY style pizza, and they recommended NYPD right across the road. Very impressed with NYPD pizza! The crust was just about PERFECT, I don't know how they do it without the NY water, but it was right on target, crispy, thin but not too thin, even had some bubbles (I love that!). The ratio of tomato sauce to cheese was perfect (I'm a purist, I typically order just plain cheese), although on our first visit (lunch), we did order one topping (pepperoni), which was very good. Plus you can get slices, I think, a nice bonus. The service was excellent on both occasions. And they have alcohol, which is why we returned for dinner after our excellent lunch experience. Had a great time on the second visit again, with another consistently good pizza. And when you hold it and fold, you do get a little bit of that nice oil drip (to me, that is part of the experience). Anyway, if you like NY pizza, don't go anywhere else, go here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I can never turn down NYPD- NEVER! So, like Allison said, what's up with the Pepsi product?  I prefer Coke as well.  But since this review is about the food, I give 5 Stars.  The pizza is pretty darn good.  I prefer the straight up pepperoni but when I am feeling meaty, I like the Brookly Family with the sausage and pepperoni.    The atmosphere is very casual and laid back, perfect for shoving pizza down your throat."}
{"text":"Raw pizza sucks.  It sucks even more when the reason you ordered take out was so you don't have to turn the oven on and you end up getting raw pizza and now you have to turn the oven on anyway to get it cooked.  When we called to let them know that our pizza was raw, they were kind enough to reverse the charge on our card and apologize for the mishap that was very nice and the reason I didn't give only one star.    I would have have been happy, MORE THAN HAPPY to pay the price and have an actual cooked pizza because even free raw pizza pisses me off on a Sunday night when I am dreading to cook.   Raw in the terms of the crust still doughy and cheese not melted, even after placing it in the oven for a good 10/15 minutes, it was still doughy.  yuck.  I like NYPD a lot though and I need to just stick with the Camelback location, they have never done me wrong."}
{"text":"This was amazing! We got the soho salad and calzones and they were to die for! Came back the next day for more!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time this weekend and it was amazing. I came in with an allergy (which can be frustrating for servers and cooks) but my waitress Khadijah was awesome. She was able to tell me exactly what I could eat and went above and beyond to make sure my food would be handled properly. On top of that the pizza was great! My boyfriend had one of the specialty pizzas and I had a gluten free pizza. Overall the place was clean and the staff was on top of things. Will definitely be returning to this location in the future."}
{"text":"I was born in NYC and spent my summers there every year since I moved at 8. And, I have only been in AZ for two years.  When I say I am serious about my PIZZA... believe me. After someone's suggestion I went to the one on McDowell Rd.  AMAZING, almost reminds me of my fav spot off Jamaica Ave.  And, they even sell it by the slice! I loved it so much I  had pizza there for a week.  But, McDowell is by work, and I live in Ahwatukee.  :(.  So thinking that all NYPD Pizza is created equal,  the family decided to go to the one in Chandler last night.  I won't be back.  Why you ask??  1- We arrived at 6:00 for dine in. We left at 8:00... when we arrived there were literally only two other families in the joint. It was empty!   We didn't order an appetizers ... just One large pizza and a personal pizza.   and we scarfed down our food in literally 10 minutes, because we needed to finish homework and put the kids to bed...   2- Lets see... the \"Large\" was smaller than the one I am use to ... I mean what Pizza doesn't get 8 slices out of the deal?  We don't eat much .. .but we were still hungry when we left and had to stop somewhere else...( and we spent 45 dollars! )  3- No one refilled Anything, or asked us about anything.... we just sat.. and waited... and waited. I almost walked out, but I ordered apple juice for the kids, and didn't want to pay for that and find a new place.  4-And, of course, when it was time to pay our bill... that also took FOREVER. Maybe it was just the night?  Not sure, but I won't be back ....   5-and the pizza wasn't even as good as the McDowell location.    I guess I will have to keep making that drive :(."}
{"text":"As someone that grew up in NY state, restaurants touting themselves as NY style aren't going to immediately impress me. However, these guys are doing things right. Went as part of a decent-sized group (about 20 people) for a tweet-up...service was great, and the calzone that I had was pretty good.   This location doesn't have a ton of seating, but carryout is available."}
{"text":"I don't know, it's all right.  The pizza was decent, but nothing I would ever crave and drive out of my way for.  The waiter was really annoying.  He kept trying to upsell us things like appetizers, desserts, salads, etc etc.  No, waiter dude, I just want my pizza.  Also, the guy had to be one of the oldest pizzeria waiters I've ever seen.  Isn't that usually a job reserved for teenagers and college students?"}
{"text":"NYPD pizza is overall good pizza in Phoenix. I have been to several of the locations and they are fairly consistent. They have pizza by the slice, which I like, and you can get all kinds of toppings on your pizza for cheap -ish. I had a slice with garlic, basil, meatball, tomato, goat cheese, and something else I can't think of right this second....it was pretty delicious. The BF and I shared some spinach artichoke dip as well, which is always delicious and terrible for you. The service is somewhat inconsistent, sometimes it is fast and friendly and sometimes it is slow for no apparent reason. The last time I went it was the latter. Despite this, I would go back because the pizza is tasty and cheap."}
{"text":"As I have ordered more delivery from this location, the quality has seemed to diminish a bit. The cheese has been a little off; for example, when the pizza is reheated, the cheese becomes very plasticky. Not awesome. Also, sometimes the delivered pizzas are not very hot, sometimes they are undercooked, and sometimes they are very good.... just not consistent. I still think this place has a good deal on the 8 inch pizzas (about 8$ with 5 toppings), but it is no longer my go to pizza place."}
{"text":"Edit: The people in charge at NYPD really take care of their customers. The person in charge of NYPD saw that we had a bad experience and contacted me to make it right. I really appreciate this in an establishment, and though this experience still happened, I know this isn't the kind of thing that happens here often.   I really like the food at NYPD. I always have, as indicated by my previous review...but my visit there tonight was truly horrific...as far as the service went. The BF and I went there to have a quick -ish dinner before he had to go take a test. We got there at 5 and needed to leave at 6....that should be enough time for us to eat.....we generally spend about 40 minutes in a restaurant, aside from fine dining. When we got there, there were 2 other tables seated...that's it. We came in to get their special which was a half appetizer, a 3 topping 10 inch pizza, and a dessert for 18$, which I saw online earlier today. I asked the waitress about the special and she said she was unsure what the details were, but that she would check on it and get back to us. She came back and told us that the deal was a half app, two 10 inch one topping pizzas, and a dessert for 18$. I then said 'It is?...well ok....' and we ordered that. We then proceeded to wait for 30 minutes for our app, while hearing the manager yell at our waitress about how she messed up the special. Now, I didn't want her to be yelled at, but it wasn't our fault that she made the mistake. I somewhat felt like the manager thought we were trying to get things for free from them, but we really weren't, we would have been content sharing the 10 inch pizza. Anyway, after our app came out (which was good) we waited another 20 min or so until we had to ask for our pizza to just be boxed up along with our dessert because we were 'in a rush.' The waitress said she was sorry she didn't know we were in a rush.....but we hadn't said anything because we WEREN'T in a rush to begin with.....we became in a rush after spending an hour waiting for service and a pizza...meanwhile people came in and ordered food to go and left without us receiving anything. I found this to be unacceptable as the restaurant was fairly empty. So we get our food (in boxes....couldn't even eat at the restaurant) and we got our bill and it was for 25$. I do not know how our bill became 25$ when it was supposed to be 18$ for the deal....but we did not have enough time to argue over it so we just paid it. That was the last straw that made me fairly upset with my experience and really turned me off of (at least) this location of NYPD. As I said, the food was good....but the service was so bad that it didn't made up for it. It caused us to have a stressful and unpleasant experience....."}
{"text":"Just moved here and I gotta tell you I was very disappointed in this place I ordered Margareta pizza, it cost way to much and was disgusting. I'll never eat here again"}
{"text":"One of best places around to get a pizza. Staff is always friendly. The only gripe I have is when I complete my order online, they try to get me to pay at the store. The only way to pay when doing an online order is paying immediately. I don't know why they ask customers to pay at the store, when they already paid. Other than that, really good food. Not greasy, which is a huge plus for me."}
{"text":"2012 Update: I've been here a few times since and never had any problems.  I had someone at NYPD contact me. This was regarding the bad pizza I had in my previous review. I thought that was really cool."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed this pizza before here & in Surprise the service had been good until last time me and my family went we waited there for 40 minutes dine in of course and no pizza finally a manager noticed we were waiting there and came up and just said sorry; we forgot your pizza, I feel we were discriminated because we were the only Hispanics there.... Anyways I still left the tip and just told them to box it up I was going  home by the way the pizza was free but was not worth the 40 minute wait:-("}
{"text":"*Customer Service 1/2 Stars, Love the fact that they greet you when you walk in. However the waiter we had seemed to be busy at a time where they store was not busy at all. Can definitely improve in that aspect and deliver premier customer service especially when the restaurant is slow like it was.  *Experience 0/1 Star, The reason for the no star here is simply because my fiancé was denied a dish that was recommended by an employee at a different location and she has ordered multiple times before.   *Food 1/1 Star, food was amazing as it always is so I have no concerns in this category. Pizza is by far my favorite pizza in Arizona for sure!  *Would I Recommend 1/1 Star, would recommend for the food. If you love pizza and haven't been here then you're missing out and need to try it!"}
{"text":"*Customer Service 1/2 Stars, The only reason I'm giving this a star here is because our waitress was nice. However we went when there was hardly anyone dining and our waitress took very long and left us waiting over fifteen minutes for each thing like our check for example.   *Experience 0/1 Star, Honestly everyone here seemed like they were being forced to be working there and didn't want to be there at all. Very noticeable.   *Food/Activity 1/1 Star, I love this place and the food is still amazing so I'll be back again for this alone.   *Would I Recommend 1/1 Star, I would definitely recommend This place for the food."}
{"text":"*Customer Service 1/2 Stars, first thing is first.. NYPD Pizza is by far the best pizza available in Arizona. Now the customer service here could use a little work. Go here quite often and it's a hit or miss between good service and mediocre. Nothing terrible though to deter me from going back just slow at times when the restaurant isn't even busy.   *Experience 1/1 Star, I always have a good time going here with my fiancé as her and I love this place.  *Food 1/1 Star, food here as I said before is top of the line compared to other Pizza in Arizona. Pizza is cooked perfectly to where it's not burnt and not raw. Also makes good for taking those extra slices home and re heating later.  *Would I Recommend 1/1 Star, I would recommend this place for the reason of it being as good as it is."}
{"text":"For meetings at work, these pizzas are often ordered. I have come to look forward to such meetings. This pizza is thin but not too thin, and somehow foldable and crispy at the same time.  There are also dessert things I saw once, and they were ridiculous. Like dough with powdered sugar and a jam like substance to dip into. I'll need to investigate these further, for your sakes of course. I'm a giver."}
{"text":"I came here on a weeknight  with friends. We got a table and menus immediately upon arrival despite a fairly crowded dining room. The menu contained several signature pizzas. I decided to order a My'za which is a personal pizza for one. I chose Da Works which is their version of a supreme. My order was up in a short time. The pizza looked delicious, but I was less than impressed. The crust was too bready for a NY style pizza. The sauce was bland and lacked that Italian flavor. Probably not enough garlic. There were plenty of toppings but it could have had a little more cheese than it did.  This was not a pizza that knocked my socks off. With so many other pizzas out there that better suit my taste in pizza I won't be beating a path to their door. I give this place a 3 star rating because they took care to meet my friend's special dietary needs and ensured that there was no cross contamination."}
{"text":"Oh ma lawd ! Good pizza ! Even better service ! Alycia was a great server. They Wallstreet is my favorite"}
{"text":"Great pizza place! My wife and I have both lived on the east coast and we really miss a good pizza pie. This is the only place we have found that actually tastes like a good east coast pie! Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Finally think I found the best pizza place in Tempe. The wallstreet pizza (mushroom, bacon, sausage and mushroom) is unworldly, but any choice of pizza is delicious here. The service was great from John and Lindsay. Overall, couldn't have asked for a better experience."}
{"text":"closest you can get to real NY pizza in AZ!  not as good as my favorite place in Nutley, NJ but if you are craving pizza you will be satisfied. Delivery does take 35- 40 min but I guess that is average in AZ"}
{"text":"Their delivery service was disappointing.  I was told 45min to an hour for delivery. At about 45 minutes the driver shows up with the wrong pizza.  He calls in and they tell him that it's in the oven, so he tells me he'll be right back. 45 minutes later he shows up with a cold pizza. This ruined the dinner experience.  I couldn't tell you if their pizza is good because I am not a fan of room temperature pizza. As a consolation the bum driver gave me some coupons (thanks!)."}
{"text":"Seeing as it's across the street from my office, I end up at NYPD at least once a week. The corner of 7th ave & McDowell has plenty of options, but this is the only place I'll stick around instead of grabbing something to go. Tawnya has my order down: Chicken Parm, iced tea, side of Hell's Kitchen hot sauce. Definitely recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"First time ever today that I've been here. It was so yummy... I'm craving it again.... super affordable prices... Yum!!"}
{"text":"I worked about a mile from here, so this was a staple for us.  I'm torn-- on one hand I thoroughly enjoyed stuffing my face with reasonably priced pizza, salad and garlic knots, but I also felt tremendous guilt after eating a reheated slice of oily cheese an hour later.  I must say though, the lunch specials are quick, efficient, and wonderfully priced.  Is it as good as eating a sloppy, fresh slice of pizza in NYC?  Of course not, but it certainly will satisfy a quality, yummy pizza craving in the desert."}
{"text":"Very good.  We split the ceazar salad. It was perfect.   The gsrlic knots needed more garlic. .  The meat lovers pizza was almst perfect needed a little more sauce.  Then they would have nsiled it.  The staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"From the second I walked in I was greeted, it was a friendly atmosphere & all of the staff were welcoming. My server Lindsey made sure my experience was phenomenal. The food was delivered to me hot and fresh. I have no complaints, the food was spectacular. Definitely going to visit again!"}
{"text":"This place has great food,fast delivery. But they always, and I mean always forget my condiments. Ranch for the wings, a fork and napkin for my salads. They were my go to for local wings, now I will have to try some place else. I also think its a waste of my time and theirs calling back for missing condiments"}
{"text":"Great place to stop in for a quick bite. We had garlic cheese knots for an appetizer. Yummy. Like a warm hug from mom."}
{"text":"Best pizza on the West side and great service! Becky was really friendly and we were created by all the staff."}
{"text":"Good pizza, salads are pretty decent. Service at the establishment and delivery are always top notch. It's a chain but at least it's a local chain?"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite pizza place The Brooklyn family is my most ordered! The use fresh basil, I love that! That also have tummy garlic cheese balls and spinach artichoke dip. The Combe of eating together is delish"}
{"text":"We stopped in late on a Friday night. We were seated immediately and our drink order taken. Our server was friendly and we never had to ask for drink refills and she stopped by regularly to check on us &  Even though they were closing in an hour, we never felt rushed."}
{"text":"I have eaten here the past 3 nights in a row! My friend and I visited this location on Friday as they have a vegan pizza. I ordered that and a small house salad with their house dressing. The salad was extremely fresh and their house dressing was a mixture of balsamic vinegar with olive oil and herbs...it's really good. The vegan pizza is a traditional pizza with Daiya vegan cheese instead of dairy cheese. Typically it has a reputation for being a little bland. NYPD did a decent job of making sure the pizza was flavorful.   The location delivers and offers online ordering. The delivery fee is $3.00 and they deliver as far north as baseline"}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and had great service and food each time!    Also LOVING the Veganizza! So wonderful to have a restaurant nearby that caters to my dietary \"differences\""}
{"text":"The pizza here was great this was my first time ordering here the pizza was ready for pick up it was hot and delicious"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza place, they have a great kids menu (around $5 including drink and dessert) with a lot of options and they even allow some substitutions (different kinds of noodles, etc.).   I got the 8\" personal pizza (forgot the name but had the works on it) which was pretty good except for the fact that I had to eat it with a fork and knife because my toppings kept falling off. I had ordered it extra crispy which usually means you can just pick it up and eat it like, well, you know, a pizza.   The small calzone was HUGE and could probably feed a small army (see pic which was taken after about 1/3 of it was eaten). This is a ton of food for only $6.49 and the kids thought they were really good. Now I'm curious to see how big the large one is!  The spaghetti was just OK, fairly generic. The service was great and it wasn't that crowded at all for a Saturday night. I would probably rate it a 3.5 but rounded up to 4 stars due to the service and the fact that they have Mountain Dew!"}
{"text":"So the kids on Saturday decided they want to go to Oregano's, so when we arrived we were told it would be an hour and 15 minute wait so we decided we would go to NYPD in the same Parking lot..Pretty convienent for us :)  We have been there before but it has been years....So we got right in and was met by Aimee our server she was very nice and told us about the special for the day, but we were there for pizza and I have forgotten what a great pie these guys make. My husband and I shared the Broklyn PIzza and the Kids they shared the kids meal with two slices..those things were huge and way more than one child can eat.  The boys also had some garlic cheese knots to starts and those were pretty darn good as well, over all a great place for the kids and the pizza and of course they do a pretty good pizza cookie to, so if you are in the area it is well worth the visit.   Side note I saw their lunch specials for the week days I will definently be going back for those..."}
{"text":"We visit here often. Shaina is a great server. She is always happy and on the ball. Garlic cheese knots are awesome! Kids eat free on Wednesday and Sunday. We ask for our pizza extra crispy because sometimes the middle can be a bit soggy.  Restaurant is always clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for.  It's cheap, yet very subpar compared to pizza joints in California.  No selection of condiments...no mercy.  The White Pizza is pretty good though."}
{"text":"I am not one to complain, but I feel like this is much needed after the experience we had last night. My boyfriend and I ordered pizza and pasta for dinner for delivery. Our order was delivered 30 min. late for starters. Okay not that big of a deal.. It happens. But the food is what really ruined it for us! I ordered Linguini with alfredo and chicken. 1. I paid EXTRA for chicken and I kid you not, there were 2 SHAVINGS of chicken in my pasta. Not even pieces of chicken - shavings of chicken!!!? 2. There was barely ANY alfredo on my pasta. I'm not exaggerating at all. Literally almost none! My pasta was dry and completely stuck together. It just tasted like plain noodles. My boyfriend even asked me, \"Did you just order plain noodles?\" It was awful. 3. The garlic knots that came with my pasta were cold and chewy, like they had been sitting out for hours. We were so dissapointed to have to throw away an overpriced dinner. (btw it was $40 for a small pizza and a pasta) We wouldn't have cared about the price if the food would have been edible."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here and, although the price was a bit higher than I would have expected for a medium pizza, it was amazingly delicious and was ready when they said it was.  Being from NY, it's hard to find really good pizza. A lot of places claim to have \"New York style pizza\", but NYPD actually delivers, even with our crappy Phoenix water."}
{"text":"Never ordering for delivery ever again! Ordered penne with vodka sauce, they brought me penne with some random tomato spicy sauce. I called to explain & the manager stated they'd send me the right order. After about 40 minutes, the delivery driver drops off a plate of JUST SAUCE. Not sure what am I supposed to do with a plate of sauce & a plate of pasta with spicy tomato sauce.  I called again, the manager says he is going to make the correct pasta himself & send it right over. What do I receive? THE SAME PLATE OF PASTA I GOT AT FIRST - the wrong one with the spicy tomato sauce. So I now have two plates of the wrong pasta & a plate of vodka sauce. This is a nightmare. Wasted my time, money, & now I didn't eat dinner because I can't tolerate spicy food."}
{"text":"This place was clean, and neat and just okay for an afternoon beer and Chicken Parmesan \"Hero\" sandwich. I strolled in off the street, but it seems that most of the traffic comes in from the rear, where the parking is. A bit confusing, for there was no one to seat me and didn't quiet know what the procedure was, so I strolled to the back and proceeded to order, and was then told that this is where people order for take out....hmmm, okay.  I apologized and told her, \"my first time\" and would like to sit at the bar, so it was all cool. She said I'd be well taken care of there. It was pretty quiet, and no server, so I chilled, checked my phone and got comfortable until Amy showed up and acted surprised to see me, but again, it was all cool because I was in no rush, which is kinda what you need to be, when you pop in as a newbie.  I had the Amber Ale on draught, which is brewed just for NYPD. This was the best part of my experience here on Saturday, for the sandwich was hot, and flavorful, but the side of pasta somewhat bland. Service was lacking but at least I wasn't completely ignored...I know ignored, and it WAS a lazy kinda day, so it was cool. I'll probably come back to try a pizza, and take advantage of some coupons I got for being a NYPD Virgin. Plus, the beer is worth a second try!"}
{"text":"The manager of this location deserves a gold medal but most of the staff needs to be retrained; when customers are told that other customers are more important than them they take their money elsewhere."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for dinner tonight. Was extremely disappointed ! The waiter said they did not serve pizza slices after 4:00 pm. We noticed the table across from us were served two slices! Why lye about about serving slices ! So wrong in my book. We ordered a meatball hero  which was slightly above Subways  meatball hero. The pizza was just average ! Not a cheap place ! We spend $42.00 on a small pizza and a meatball hero. When it comes to knowing what good pizza is, we know what good pizza is all about. We are both former New Yorker's !  So please be aware!"}
{"text":"It's good pizza at a good price.  NYPD Pizza has a nice NYC theme from the honeycomb black and white tile floor to the subway themed walls. For those of us who like to support local business, this is it. Locally owned since 1996.  If you have kids they eat free on Wednesdays and Sundays (rules apply.). I've eaten here often and will be back.  You won't go wrong with NYPD."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I absolutely LOVE the fact that they offer a vegan pizza-- appropriately named the 'Veganniza.' I am always happy to find places that offer both vegan and non-vegan options so my meat-eating boyfriend and I can both enjoy a good meal. =) The staff is pleasant and knowledgeable and the atmosphere is very welcoming. This place is a bit expensive, but it is well worth it. Whenever My boyfriend and I have the extra money, we definitely like to treat ourselves to their wonderful pizza. =)"}
{"text":"This NYPD has fantastic pizza, a great atmosphere, and awesome service!  Four of us met for pizza and we were lucky to have Bethany as our server. She was very attentive, friendly, and pleasant. We had Da Works pizza and ate so much of it that we practically had to be rolled out...it was yummy!  We look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Both the regular and gluten free pizzas were excellent. The minestrone soup was hearty and the Asiago Chicken Ceasar was very good and filling. Excellent restaurant for Celiacs or othe gluten-free diners."}
{"text":"NYPD Pizza is the best pizza in Arizona.   The cheese and toppings are high quality and very tasty.     Ryan is the GM at this location, he is a really nice guy and his staff is outstanding and friendly."}
{"text":"Pizza was plain.. the pasta was good. Would I go back? Probably not.. also a bit pricy for not that great food. Environment is nice ho"}
{"text":"Have to say for pizza, this was the best I've had other than actually being in NYC. Went last week for dinner. The restaurant is small, so it always seems to be packed and at least a 10 minute wait. We even got there later, like 7pm. Would have checked in through Yelp but there is no wifi. Service was a little slow, but it's a busy place. Worth the wait though, pizza was excellent. Best mozzarella I've ever had on pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was nothing special but was really disappointed in the lemon cake. Tasted fine but for the price, over $5, the piece was very small, 2 inches wide on the wide side and 5 inches long."}
{"text":"NYPD does a good job on pizza and other dishes. I usually go there for lunch for the specials. I get two slices with any toppings you want and a drink for $6.75. Pizza is always good I usually get it a little crispy."}
{"text":"They do a pretty good job for Arizona for New York style pizza. Have a good lunch special for $6 includes two slices with any toppings and a drink. $6.90 out the door"}
{"text":"So eight of my friends and I planned a night out on the town starting with Oregano's on Scottsdale Road and Shea. This plan changed as we all grew tired of waiting in the parking lot just to get seated! We waiting for 1 hour and 45 minutes! Now that's ridiculous! We love Oregano's pizza but when we are all starving and wanting to get our night started we decided to look elsewhere. We looked across the way and there we saw NYPD Pizza. We were ushered in 15 minutes later.   The service was fast and great. The food was very yummy! We all chose different entrees and shared tastings.  OOOhhh.....Garlic Knots.....need I say more. Thanks to NYPD Pizza our night was soon back on track.   To make things better we ran into such a nice man who was a total gentleman to us all. He even held the door open for all of us as we were leaving the restaurant. Who was he?. . . Charles Barkley. ( LOL...I know) Besides the whole Charles Barkley thing we would most defiantly go back and visit this NYPD Pizza. It's much better than waiting nearly 2 hours just to get seated."}
{"text":"Nice dinner for my daughter and I. She enjoyed her pizza bites and ice cream sundae! I had the eggplant parmigiana, very good. Every bites was just as hot as the first. I'd suggest ordering an extra side of sauce for the spaghetti side. Tatum our server was good. We will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Glad to have them open up again been missing them since they left Union Hills Address  Still awesome food and Great friendly service. Melliott31"}
{"text":"Ate here twice, not a fluke! Great service; friendly fast and genuine. Not to mention great pizza and amber ale to pair"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with 3 other people. Waitress was quick to take our order. There of us ordered calzones which stated a wait time of 20-30 min. After waiting for about 1 hour, none of us had our food. The waitress and another waiter walked by several times and never said a word to us regarding our food or asked if we needed anything. When we got our food, one of the ingredients In my calzone was wrong. Overall, the food was fantastic, but the service was terrible."}
{"text":"Well, I pretty much love NYPD Pizza. Calzones are my favorite. I've been ordering the Frank Sinatra with various fillings for years. Absolutely adore the Ricotta and I was extremely happy when they introduced the small size...which is still big enough for 2 meals. I do enjoy the pizza but in my personal opinion, it's better as takeout and then being baked again in your oven...I prefer it a little crispier, pretty much always get pepperoni and basil...occasionally throwing in pineapple. Also get ranch with everything...I'm not huge on ranch but I would bathe in the ranch from NYPD Pizza. The cheesy garlic knots are also phenomonal!"}
{"text":"I love NYPD! I've been to multiple locations and the food is always consistently good.  It's the best ranch on the planet, I could seriously eat a vat of it! I enjoy both the pizza and calzones, I look forward to trying the wings again now that they have new flavors. You also have to order the Garlic Knots, they are delicious both with or without cheese!"}
{"text":"I've loved NYPD for years. The ranch there is my #1 favorite ranch and I'm not one of those people that eats ranch on everything.  I'm partial to the calzones because I love ricotta cheese.  I really love that they now have the smaller portioned ones, which are still large but not nearly as mammoth as the regular sized ones. The garlic knots are phenomonal, I recommend you try them if it's your first time.  I like the pizza as well.  I find the pizza to be better the second day when you re-heat it in the oven but I like a crispier crust, so that's probably why. I also think it's cool that they serve Phoenix Brewery beer, it's cool to see businesses support each other."}
{"text":"Excellent service... Michelle was awesome and very attentive... Wings were great and meaty, spicy but not umbearable. Pizza just the way i liked it.  Thanks for a very pleasant evening."}
{"text":"Best Pizza...within 20 miles of me.  If you love NY pizza, I mean the easy to fold and literally slides down your throat after you take a bite kinda NY pizza then this is it!  Garlic knots and calzones are 5 stars too!  If it wasn't sooo good I might say it is a little pricey but my stomach won't let my penny pinching brain go there.  Excellent for families!!"}
{"text":"Let's get this out there now:  I'm a huge fan of NYPD Pizza.  I love the Chandler location, the Avondale location... it's all the same!  Anyways, this place is great.  Their pizzas are always delicious, fresh, and hot from the oven!  The crust is crispy when you first bite into it and chewy in the middle and their sauce has some good flavor.  The toppings are always generously piled on and the cheese-drag is almost sinful.  Love it.  The garlic knots are truly the best.    The atmosphere is super cute.  It's just an overall great place to dine with some friends or your significant other."}
{"text":"So please bare with me as I write this review. I literally just signed up so I can talk about this place, as well as others. Like Matthew G's review, this too is based off of the service.  So it's a Sunday night, and a friend of mine was feeling like Italian so we decided to try this place out. We walked in and there were quite a few people, it wasn't too overly crowded. There was no hostess so the waitress told us that she would get to us asap. Well, she forgot about us and another waiter sat a group of 3 before us. So that waiter sat us right away. Now all I ordered was a pepsi and my friend ordered a house salad with spaghetti with meatballs. The place did get busy, but again, not too extreme. After about 40 minutes of waiting, we decided to leave. I'm sure the food is outstanding, but then again, we never got it. So we decided to get up and leave and head down to Venezias, which is on Cooper and Ray. We ordered the exact same thing, and her salad came out in 5 minutes, and dinner out in 10 minutes still piping hot. As far as the service goes, I don't recommend going, but I would definitely love to try the food, IF I wanted to wait for almost an hour. Better off going to Venezias."}
{"text":"Almost a bad experience saved by exceptional customer service! This is definitely one of our favorite places for pizza. We live outside of their delivery zone and drive to pick up our takeout order.   We came home after picking up our order to find our order of bruschetta did not include the tomato topping, only the bread. I called to complain to the manager expecting maybe a refund or credit for a free appetizer on our next visit. I was pleasantly surprised when they said they would have the bruschetta delivered to us shortly.   When I told the manager that I felt bad having her driver do that because we live outside of their normal delivery zone, she said it was not a problem at all and that this error was 100% their mistake and they were happy to fix it. Not only did they deliver the bruschetta but they delivered complimentary cheesecake as well.   GREAT customer service! The food is amazing as well...upstate wings will change your life!"}
{"text":"They claim their secret is the special filtered water.  I made fun of this initially, but they might actually have something.  NYPD's pizza is crisp and refreshing, a phrase which I've never used to describe pizza before.  Isn't this type of food supposed to weigh you down and make you swear you'll start your diet tomorrow?  The beer selection is great, with several local choices.  A small pizza can easily feed two people, maybe three if you're looking for a light meal.  We got Da Works, which is their version of a supreme, but looking over the remaining scraps of the tables around us, other pizza styles were just as enjoyable.  Other Yelpers have complained about the service, but it was spectacular in my opinion.  Maybe they've made some changes recently.  The vast majority of the waiters looked like firefighters (okay, that's probably the uniform, probably supposed to look like the police, plus the fact that Arizona people look slightly different from the Miamians I'm used to), and they were super friendly and on top of things despite the increasing number of customers.  The host was obviously gunning to be a waiter, and I have no doubt he'll make it soon - great personality and motived to boot.  Wish I had caught his name. I'll make sure to do so during our next visit."}
{"text":"I eat at NYPD almost every day when im working in chandler and Melissa the bartender is awesome, she  knows what I drink and my glass is never empty."}
{"text":"Having grown up on authentic NY pizza, I will say that the pizza here is not half bad!  It's definitely not a truly NY style pizza, but definitely one of the better pizzas I have had here in the Valley.  However, my favorite things was those yummy and warm garlic knots!  Those things were delish!  And at $5 for a full lunch (slice of pizza, 6 garlic knots AND a drink), this is a great little lunchtime spot!"}
{"text":"Friday night, ordered for pick up. Food is always amazing. But the serivce seems to be getting BETTER. The bartender offered me a drink while I waited for my order to be picked up. They gave me EXTRA ranch, where most places charge you, and just overall friendly and professional. Garlic knots are my favorite. I ate them the next day for lunch AND dinner! Mmmmph! Pizza is terrific and the menu includes a lot of other dishes I am eager to try!"}
{"text":"It's decent... its better than streets of ny....  but if you want \"true\" new york pizza  hit up rays pizza ,  if you in chandler go to la famiglia on alma school and dobson.  They have authentic family style Italian food and pizza."}
{"text":"The service at this location is fantastic. We really appreciate how thoughtful our server and the staff were tonight. Food was great and I love that they have gluten free options! We will be coming back for pizza night again soon!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because of the high level of service I received after our mishap here. I received a handwritten letter from the general manager, Luke Newman, apologizing for the bad service on our last visit. Not only did he apologize, he stated that they used the experience we had as a coaching tool during the restaurants training meeting, so hopefully that doesn't happen again. Also, he sent a $50 gift card so that we could give the restaurant another chance. I wasn't expecting them to be so responsive to my Yelp review, but I certainly appreciate NYPD pizza going out of there way to make my last visit up to me."}
{"text":"Our server Jessica has been great everytime we get her! We love this place! My husband and I came here one night to try it and we only come here for our pizza now! Jessica our server is so personable and friendly, we make it a point to sit in her section if she is working!"}
{"text":"This place is great. One of the neatest pizza restaurants I've been to.  The service is quick and extremely friendly. The appetizer menu is good but I love and recommend their new fried zucchini sticks. The pizza menu is a bit overwhelming due to the variation. From Mott Street Meat Lover to Joey's Favorite (vegetarian), the're all good. New York's Finest Cookie n' Cream is my dessert of choice. Warm oatmeal cookies over soft vanilla ice cream. I just can't get enough of this stuff."}
{"text":"Food is usually good but we did have a Meh dinner there this week. Saturday night, ate in,  and ordered side salads and a Sicilian pizza with pinched sausage and mushrooms.   I prefer pinched sausage over sausage kibble you generally get on pizzas so I was looking forward to that hot, juicy slice. The pizza arrives very quickly. I mean so quick that it made me wonder. Anyway, we finished our salads and served out the slices.   So ok, here's the list. Crust was likely precooked. And for a slightly deeper crust I guess they do that. The pizza was underdone, frankly. The cheese barely melted and some on my slice wasn't fully melted. The sausage was tired looking from the start. Nothing juicy about it. The mushrooms neither fresh nor cooked. Mind you, if you're going to put mushrooms on a pizza, why not sauté them so they develop flavor and don't dry out? The sauce was nowhere near bubbly when it arrived and when we dug into it, well just sad. Could have been a frozen pizza.   Sicilian is not their signature pizza.   Service was nice, we did return it with a few bites missing from some pieces, and they did refund the pie. The manager did come over and ask us what was wrong and gave a bit of attitude about not eating it right away (we waited 5 minutes) but if it's not cooked, scarfing is not going to help. I should mention that they offered to cook another but we were off pizza by that time."}
{"text":"If this pizza is really representative of authentic New York pizza, then New York pizza is severely overrated. The pizza here is always soggy and on the verge of tasting undercooked. It is even hard to cut for my kids because it is so mushy on the bottom. My parents swear this is their favorite pizza place but I just don't see it. Try floridinos on Alma School for a quality pizza."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are regulars at our local NYPD. I love the Hell's Kitchen wings and it's the best pizza around. Today we decided to try out the Frank Sinatra calzone. My mind was blown with its oozing goodness. The crust was delicious. It was decently priced and the portions are huge!! I will be craving this again soon, I can feel it. Our waitress was Donte, she was great. Very personable and our drinks were always full. She was the one who suggested the calzone. I am forever grateful she suggested it!! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The calzones here are amazing and we had great service today. Our waiter David was polite and did an awesome job. My drink was always full and he even brought us steak knifes to cut into our calzone! I Will always come here when I'm feeling like a calzone!"}
{"text":"Great pizza ordered the night of Cards game and they delivers on time. Pizza was good and hot and we ate the whole thing. Great service from order to delivery."}
{"text":"The bruschetta pizza is my favorite! Our waiter, Keith, said the ricotta is made in house. I made this a stop on my trip back to phoenix to visit. I used to live there and would order delivery with my roommate every couple of weeks. Keith had my friend and I dying laughing a few times. Very entertaining and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Pizza and calzones are awesome! The bartender is always helpful with beers to try. The food is out fast from the kitchen."}
{"text":"I previously visited this restaurant during a busy Saturday night and was disappointed with the service and quality of the pizzas, so I wrote about it on Yelp. A manager from NYPD Pizza contacted me within a few days asking me to e-mail so I could outline my visit. I finally contacted the manager, David, and he was prompt, professional, and very accommodating. He offered to send me a meal voucher to use the next time I visited an NYPD Pizza.   During my second visit, the manager at this location, Rebecca, was very accommodating and very receptive to any requests we had for her. The service was fantastic (shout out to our waiter, Jeremy!!) and the food was much better this time around. My boyfriend ordered the chicken parmigiana and I ordered penne with marinara and meatballs...both were delicious!  Finally...ALWAYS order the garlic knots as an appetizer. You will not be disappointed!  Thank you for the wonderful customer service and great food...we will be back!"}
{"text":"From out town on business going by yelp on this place got to say everyone is very friendly service is awesome   I will definitely be back!!!!!!!! I highly recommend NYPD PIZZA"}
{"text":"Hybrid restaurant setup - walk through pizza by the slice at lunchtime (like Ray's or Sbarro) but full service dining in the evening, with real servers and a real bar!  Pizza is consistently good quality - good crust, very milky cheese, and generous toppings.  Values available Monday and Tuesday if you're ordering two pizzas.  Unless you're just doing a lunch slice or takeout with coupon, it can be a little expensive.  Poor choice of name, in my opinion.  NYPD? Pffft."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great service, and oh so much more reasonable than that overhyped pizza place adjacent to this location.  Nice NY thin crust with a good quality, milky mozzarella cheese.  Crust is like eating a fresh loaf of crusty french bread that I had in Europe.  Garlic knots are always just right with the dough that just seems to melt in your mouth.  Topping portions are just right, and they do a much better job with seating than the local competition.  Only negative is I absolutely hate the name of this place."}
{"text":"I love their food! Try the Pizza Blanca if you like Pizza without the red sauce. Thanks guys for making our dinners great! Highly recommend them."}
{"text":"I hosted a small soiree for a UFC fight one wknd.  (Hmm, the words soiree & UFC seem odd in the same sentence but whatever).  So, the group wanted pizza but I was in no mood for the usual chains like Pizza Butt or Papa Somebody.  Although, those places can be tasty, I just wasn't thrilled about those options @ the time.  Never having eaten @ NYPD, we order the 'Brooylyn Family' , which did not disappoint.  The pepperoni was light and didn't taste/look super greasy.  The sausage was actually cut like pepperoni, as opposed to the usual manner it's served on pizza (tiny bits without the casing).  I think it tastes better when it's thinly sliced like the pepperoni--again, not so greasy.  And the fresh basil leaves rocked.  Thin crust was perfect--not crackery and they didn't overload it with sauce or cheese keepin the crust from getting mushy.  If you're tired of the usual pizza joints, definitely put this on your list to check out.  It's GREAT!"}
{"text":"We ordered the margarita pizza and it was so disappointing! Less than 50% of the surface area had cheese. Maybe 4 slices of tomato. The crust and tomato sauce was ok, but couldn't over look the lack of ingredients and for 19.99 it wadded innately not worth it!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable sitting at the bar in the center, having a hand tossed pizza, salad and couple glasses of Chianti. Ryan, the manager, is very friendly and wants to be sure you are happy. Example: seven people showed up ten minutes before close and he served them dinner leisurely. Stayed open for them an hour!!!"}
{"text":"We were greeted and sat immediately, server arrived a few minutes later to take our orders and drinks with an unwelcoming attitude and tone. Okay, maybe he had a bad day? 20 minutes later the server returns to tell us things are backed up and there will be a little delay with our food, okay that's fine, it's a semi busy Friday night, totally reasonable.   I ordered a salad pizza which is basically flatbread with salad on top. My partner ordered a chicken Parmesan sandwich. Nothing complicated here.   5 full tables of 4-6 people were sat after us and received all their food within the hour and fifteen minutes we gave this place. At least 8 delivery driver orders had been carried out. During this time our server disappeared from the floor sporadically and only returned to tend to his other tables across the floor, the two managers overseeing the place making their rounds completely ignored our table and eye contact.   Odd part is, our table was located in the middle of the floor and we're not exactly small guys either. So there's no way all these people couldn't see us.   We sat there patiently, giving everyone the benefit of a doubt but were left alone ignored with disappointment. Server never returned to refill drinks or update us, literally avoided our table and turned his back to tend other tables as he came within calling distance. There was no shortage of staff so I doubt he was overloaded.   Unfortunately we decided to just leave after that. left a few bucks on the table for the two sodas we got. Waiting and hour and fifteen minutes for essentially salad on flat bread and breaded chicken in a bun while being ignored is unreasonable considering the place wasn't full at all.  Just sucks to have a terrible experience on your couples night out at a place that has otherwise glowing reviews."}
{"text":"I have eaten at NYPD pizza for a long time. Typically it was the Colonnade location at 18st and camelback in Phoenix. My now wife worked there many years ago so it was just convenient. I never really liked their pizza much because I thought it was too greasy.  This new NYPD opened on 7th and McDowell down the street from our house a while back so we tried it and wow, this location is amazing. The food is fantastic, the service was great, and the business is super clean and inviting. The pizza isn't greasy any more, its fantastic.   The cooked mozzarella isn't great because they don't do it in sticks but hey, you can't have everything. You should check this location out."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I have ever had. Only down side on my visit was that there were two family groups who sat their children at tables away from them...the noise was horrific."}
{"text":"I love pizza and this is one of the best pizza joints in AZ. The sauce is amazing. I've never had a bad pizza there. The garlic knots are cheap and are a great appetizer."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first trip to NYPD Pizza and it was very enjoyable. My wife and I ordered a 14\" pepperoni and artichoke heart pizza with hand tossed crust. We also went with cheesy garlic knots as an appetizer.   The garlic knots were were a doughy texture with good flavor, served with marinara dipping sauce, and my wife absolutely loved them. The pizza had that New York floppy crust that you need to fold over to eat. The sauce was mildly seasoned with a strong tomato flavor, and the amount of cheese was generous, no need to pay for extra unless you're just cheese crazy. It looked and tasted very fresh, not at all greasy.   The employees were very friendly, helpful, and quick. Despite the restaurant being almost full, we were in and out in just over 30 minutes. Our bill with 2 sodas and tax was $27, very reasonable for the amount of food we had.   We enjoyed the food and laid back atmosphere and will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Just the facts. I went to this NYPD Pizza 2 days ago around 6pm. They were not bust. A server met me at the door and greeted me. I ordered wings and ice water. Later I ordered the deep dish pizza. The server said this may take 20 to 25 minutes to cook. I waited 40 minutes and a manger came over. He said the pizza came out over cooked on the bottom crust and it would take another 20 to 25 minutes to cook another pizza. I could not wait and asked to pay for my wings and Diet Pepsi. The manger came back with the pizza with the over cooked crust in a to go book and said he took it of the bill and I could take the over cooked pizza home with me. I said no thanks and left.   Sever was very nice. Kitchen needs some work."}
{"text":"I used to live in NYC. I haven't been willing to try this place because of it's funny name. But today finally I tried it and I was so surprised! Their pizza is so good. They serve pizza just baked. The waiter was excellent! The best pizza in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I really hate to wait for food and last time I came here, it took 1 hour to get my pizza out of the oven. Having only 2 cooks are you kidding me???? Get more than 5 cooks. I wish this restaurant could have a faster pace of giving a customer what they ordered."}
{"text":"This was the greatest meal I have had in a long time. The zeppolis desert were amazing. Best desert ever for only a couple of bucks and they don't give you a sprinkle of powdered sugar, they give you a whole bowl of it. Amazing 10/10."}
{"text":"We had amazing service. Andy, specifically was attentive and friendly, but the rest of the service staff was great as well. Mike, the manager was very present and welcoming. The food was delicious. All and all a super night!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, garlic knots and the best customer service I've gotten in an airport. Also the best value for any restaurant in any airport. Thumbs up y'all! I'll see us next time I fly though PHX."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times and I have to say it is one of my favorite places to eat. Every time I have stopped in all the waiters/waitresses were very polite and pretty funny. I've gone in with some real jokesters so I was pleased the staff could keep up.I definitely bring guests of mine there when I want something I know is delicious."}
{"text":"Had pizza delivered to our hotel it was delivered in 40-45 minutes and was HOT!! Not to mention very tasty. We were very pleased with our order and pleasantly full with pepperoni pizza, garlic cheese knots, half Wall Street (no bacon add olives) and white blanca with chicken."}
{"text":"Our waiter mr. McDreamy was excellent however the food was not what I had remembered it sucked no kidding it did.   The food was bland. The sauce the cheese knots the pizza literally no flavor.  Sad to say pizza Hut offered way more after we left"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had a mean craving for pizza and wings after browsing the Phoenix Zoo...We thought this place was Streets of New York, till we got there and it was a NYPD (did I mention I don't like police). lol So we said screw it and decided to check it out anyway. When we got there the host seemed annoyed and practically threw our menus on the table. He Sucked!   We ordered the Hell's Kitchen wings and the Philly Cheese steak pizza. First off the Wings were fantastic, although not as spicy as we anticipated. The wings came with sliced jalapeños scattered over the top of them, but it was just a psychological thing to make you think they're spicier. The Philly pizza was sub par. It was low on cheese and some what under cooked. There was still water from the meat running of the sides, basically making the crust soggy.   Our waiter was very generous, unfortunately I forgot her name. She changed my perspective of the service.  For some strange reason, the host was still giving me the stink eye...I think he liked my girlfriend or something or may be just hated his job. lol      Overall, I would have preferred hitting up Streets of New York! By the way did I mention I don't like police. Except a friend of mine who just graduated the academy. Congratulations! Now keep me safe from other police."}
{"text":"We stumbled into this place after going to Encanto Park. The environment is very trendy, the place is well decorated. Prices are OK and the pizza was great."}
{"text":"REALLY good pizza and the option for the individual size was great since my husband and I prefer different toppings."}
{"text":"Beautiful day to sit outside; and I am not sure if that made any difference but the service was mediocre at best.   I had to ask if we could have drinks.   The toppings were scarce on the pizza we ordered but it was delicious so that was good . The location was very convenient; just a couple blocks from I 10. We will stop again."}
{"text":"This pizza place is one of my favorite places to go to, especially with a group.  The price is very reasonable and the employees are always super friendly.  the only complaint is that sometimes it takes a bit too long for the food to come out and ironically, the slower the restaurant, the longer it takes for the food to be served.  I suppose that makes sense as they don't have everything prepped, but even so, sometimes it feels a bit too long.    The pizza is very good and they have some decent lunch specials. they also have a nice 8inch pizza that is about $6.  My whole family really enjoys the garlic knots from the appetizer menu and they run about $5.  My kids are older now, but one thing that I really loved when they were younger was the kids menu slice of pizza comes out already cut into little bite size squares.  This comes in pretty handy with little ones!   All in all, a great place with good food for a good price."}
{"text":"So far we have only tried the margarrita  and the Brooklyn family pizza but now I'm dying to try the Buffalo chicken pizza.  It's pricey, but worth it if you consider the quality vs regular pizza chains (we've neatly tried them all)"}
{"text":"So for quite some time I've heard a lot of about NYPD and how good their pizza is, so I finally decided to give it a try. I was first greeted by a very nice hostess and then taken to my seat. I truthfully was more focused on experiencing the quality of the pizza, until our wonderful server Sydney, greeted us promptly and was probably one of the most friendly servers I've ever had. I was a server myself for years and have had a lot of bad serving experiences and I will tell you this was certainly the complete opposite. She was very attentive, always checking on us, and was extremely sweet. To top it off the BBQ chicken pizza I had was phenomenal. The service was excellent, the pizza was great, so my experience certainly lived up to expectations. I will definitely be coming back. Definitely ask for Sydney if you want excellent, friendly service!"}
{"text":"I love NY city pizza pie.  Excellent rendition of sharing a portion of NY here in the desert."}
{"text":"I love this place! You can't beat their M-F lunch specials! I get a speciality salad and a slice. I get the Soho Salad- it's AMAZING!"}
{"text":"YUM!  I can never remember what it is, but order the salad thing on pita bread!  It will change your life!  My co-workers and I would always go in here and share one of those and then we'd each get a slice of pizza.  Perfect amount of food- low prices- never too/disgustingly full.  Their bilinis are wonderful as well!"}
{"text":"Argh!!! I'm sitting here with my 2 boys and we've been waiting over 35 minutes for garlic knots!  My very rambunctious boys are starting to eat their crayons.  Its Friday night and they are full but they have plenty of staff...why so slow? Oh here are the knots. Huh? Where's the garlic? These are bread balls with sesame.  My kids seem to enjoy their cheese slices but they'll eat cardboard.  At least kids menus come with dessert and due to the wait I'm getting free dessert to go.  My Greek salad was ok.  Now long wait for kids sundaes...I can see my waitress just standing around.  Is somebody milking a cow to make ice cream?  If my dessert is good later on they may redeem themselves a bit but for now I'm really disliking this place  Bill comes, and theyve double-charged me for the dessert.  Another 15 minute wait for the correction.   The manager comes to apologize, something about a new kitchen guy.  Still, the kitchen guy may be slow, but was he the one serving the scoop of ice cream for the kids?  I think not.  It was a bad combo of new kitchen guy/bad waitress.  So all in all, 2 hours to eat 2 cheese slices and some garlic knots.    What a waste."}
{"text":"Very Good! Had the Margherita pizza and salad. Pizza was great, and the salad was huge. Nice atmosphere too, and very attentive waitress. Cool place!"}
{"text":"NYPD's pizza and service were average, at least on this night. The Pizza crust and sauce were bland and could us some spice. The breaded zucchini appetizer seemed strait outta the freezer. The bartender/ waitresses were nice. The bathrooms needed restocking and attention. This place will work if you're in the vicinity and have a pizza craving but dont expect to be wow'ed."}
{"text":"I love it :) we ordered on the phone, said we were going to PICK UP, and we get there and they say they don't have our order! Amazing! They find it, said it went out for delivery, funny because we didn't give them a delivery address! They forget 6 of our items as well that they charged us for and said they'd have to charge us again :) don't recommend"}
