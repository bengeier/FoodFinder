{"text":"I spent two years in Mexico City eating street tacos nearly every day.  These are the real deal including the green and red sauces.  If you prefer 'American' Mexican food this might be a little much for you.  Or if your reference for good Mexican tacos is from Oklahoma City you probably will not appreciate the authentic Mexican flavors of these tacos.  Asada, Al Pastor, Carnitas were all fantastic."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is located off of exit 32 on i85 by the airport. They serve food from a small food truck that has many Spanish locals come by during their lunch or after work. Next to them is a small Spanish convenience store which you can find some good Spanish bread candy drinks and food. As for the truck, hands down, the best tacos I've ever had! Not only is their tacos amazing, so is their juicy tortas. I love the chorizo by the way They also do call in orders so that's a bonus. There may be a slight language barrier, but c'mon use your basic Spanish to order some Tacos! (It's the second most used language next to English). Anyways, their sauces are amazing!!! They have three sauces and give you one of each per order. My favorite is the darker green one, not too spicy but spicy enough. They have a good menu selection so tacos are not the only thing they have. Many people don't know about this place since it's tucked away but if you ever come across it, go ahead and give it a try."}
{"text":"Located outside of the Little Rock Food Market, directly off of i-85, is a very generic looking white food truck. My dad claimed that this truck had the best tacos compechanas and sope de carnitas; let me tell you, both authentic (said having never been to Mexico!) and most delicious food truck experience I've been to in a while (plus the $2 and $3 price tag does not hurt!) Oh my goodness, where to even begin with the delightful experience. You'll typically find this truck outside of Little Rock Food Market daytime and late nights. Although, per Charlotte food truck laws, they occasionally move across the street to the Tienda Mexicana La Hidalguelse parking lot. You'll find four old bar seats outside the food truck, but most people take their food to go. The neighborhood around the truck isn't exciting, or particularly inviting, so I'd recommend a home trip or park visit. 

Tacos campechanos is where it's at, this is a type of taco that combines multiple meats, usually pork and beef. They serve it on two corn tortillas with onions, cilantro and you can top it with a green (guacamole) or red (chile) hot sauce. They are definitely using chorizo in their campechanos because it's spicy and delicious! The sope de carnitas is beef served on a thicker corn  'tortilla' topped with lettuce, cilantro and sour cream. Both of the items were delicious, although I loved the spicy flavor of the taco. My box also came with a wedge of lime and to-go of the green hot sauce plus it was only $5 for both items. If you're looking for something quick, delicious and filling, I highly recommend stopping at Tacos La Hidalguense; I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Perfect authentic Mexican taco truck tacos. Skip Sabor or the hoitey toitey fancy taco places and come here to get marinated meats with onion and cilantro with your choice of sauce. The red sauce is the spiciest and the best. It takes a little while because they make everything to order, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"This is a food truck in the parking lot across from its store front. It gets crazy busy. Wait times are long. 20+ minutes after ordering. Spanish speaking cooks/staff that can barely speak very good English but they can take your order if you keep that in mind.  Be patient and respectful. No need to mistreat them for it. 

Best to call in your order before you arrive- 704-293-9706. 

Pay Cash only at truck. 

Cards accepted but you have to take your food ticket across to their store front and pay inside at cashier.

So far only once that I bought food here that the meat was actually too salty.

On my list to try: Chicharron (fried pork skin) taco. The shell is a long fried pork skin topped with meat of your preference. Looked good."}
{"text":"This taco cart has really good and cheap tacos. For $2/taco, there is a wide variety of options. They also have really good salsa. If you like spicy, ask for the red salsa. It's available only on request."}
{"text":"Aside from the lack of ambience, keep in mind this is a food truck, this place is great. I've been wanting to stop by here for months. Miguel's which is across the street, is my usual go to for tacos, but this place might be my new spot.
 $2 tacos, who could ask for anything more? They were generous with the meat and the taste was great. 
Steady traffic from Latinos in the know, so you have to know there's something to it. Hard working people who deserve the business"}
{"text":"The best authentic Mexican food in Charlotte, which doesn't come easily rated since I am a California girl. It's not the prettiest place and the drive in the rocky parking lot may make you feel like you're on an outback trail with Ace Ventura. But if you can make it pass all of that you will be rewarded with the most delicious, mouthwatering burrito. I only wish they served chips as well."}
{"text":"Very salty and over priced.

After getting spoiled with GREAT mexican fare in OKC for 7 years, perhaps I need to be grateful for a taco truck close to work. But this place is NOT GOOD. 

My order: 2 tacos \"al pastor\" and 1 taco \"azada\". There is so much salt on this food that I literally cannot tell which is which. I'm not even kidding. And holy cow is this greasy! YUCK!

Also, the prices are high. I've never seen a Torta sell for $8 before. The taco's are $2 each, which is only slightly more than the average truck taco in OKC. 

I won't be going back..."}
