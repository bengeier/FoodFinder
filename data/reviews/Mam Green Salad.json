{"text":"Hidden gem in one of the TD towers. Fresh lightly dressed salads. Great value. My favorite is the smoked salmon salad."}
{"text":"Best! Actually empty on Friday lunch time! So sad I discovered it on my last day in this neighbourhood. Large is giant and Cobb only $9!! Very tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"So happy I discovered this spot! Another great addition to my lunch options in the Path. The salads here are very fresh and packed with toppings! I've tried a few so far and my favourite is the hummus salad - the hummus and the falafel are so tasty! I've also tried their lunch special and didn't really like the chicken (it had a weird texture - spongy and rubbery).   The salads get watery really quick though, I think largely because of the tomatoes and cucumbers. So don't let it sit around!"}
{"text":"Went here with a coworker after reading about it online. I ordered the Cobb Salad which seemed to be one of their popular choices.   The salad was huge and really worth it in my opinion - I pretty much asked for all the toppings. They really stuff the plastic container! Everything was fresh and I enjoyed the falafel and hummus. I am not a big fan of the grilled chicken (it is the spongy kind you'd get at Tim Hortons) and the dressing was a bit sour for my liking.  Service was good and pretty fast. I recommend ordering off Ritual if you have it."}
{"text":"This place is my go to - I work in the area and if I can, I go every single day for lunch. The place is getting more popular each day and I have to schedule my whole day around going at the optimal time and avoid the line up.  They don't just make salads, they make edible artistic masterpieces: Each tomato slice and olive strategically placed and arranged to create a thing of beauty that is only matched by the amazing taste of each and every single component - all for about $9. Also your 10th salad is free with the stamp card.  They always have the freshest salad components in addition to seasoned grilled chicken, falafels (a favourite) and smoked salmon.  I would highly recommend Mam's, not only for the sustenance but for the experience that makes every day coming to work a pleasure and a life worth living."}
{"text":"Formerly a strong 5. But now under new management so basically a 0. Food is not edible. Shawarma is burnt to a crisp. Salads are stale. Avoid."}
{"text":"Got the lunch special with falafel and mashed sweet potato. Huge portion and delicious. I rarely give out 5 out of 5s too but mam deserves it. The location is pretty sketchy tho as it's located hidden away in the basement of the design exchange tower next to a dry cleaner place."}
{"text":"Discovered this place after all my coworkers raved about it. The salads are large and filling and they definitely do not skimp out on anything. It's well worth the money if you're looking for a filling and relatively healthy lunch option in the downtown core.    The words out about this place so there's quite a crowd around noon now. I would suggest going for an earlier lunch (1130-1145 or later to avoid the lunch rush)."}
{"text":"This \"secret salad\" location has strength in quality, quantity, art and customization. I work close to it and if time permitted, i would eat here everyday. If u are new to it, their staples are a cobb salad or special. You may way want to split it with a friend as their \"small\" is pretty substantial and is cheaper than average downtown salad.  Call in to order in advance, because the \"secret\" is out and the lines can get long."}
{"text":"This is a great little hidden gem, though not as hidden as I wish it is. If you are going around lunch time, expect a long line up.  I started off with the lunch special, which is GREAT value. You get meat, veggie, egg, cheese, etc, all in a big heavy box for a very reasonable price. Just like some of the other reviews said, it's almost like a piece of art. They delicately and carefully place those cucumbers, or cherry tomatoes, eggs, chicken, etc on top. I've sent pictures of the salad to my friends and they all liked it just by looking at it. I later stopped ordering the lunch special because I just couldn't finish it.  My favourite now is the Smoked Salmon Wrap. It's almost equally heavy as the lunch special with lots of good stuff in it. The Salmon tastes great, so good that I wish they could put more pieces in. The staff takes great care making the order right for you. They are extremely friendly.  They also offer a loyalty card that gives your 10th salad for free.  Enjoy your salad. :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I grabbed some salads here before taking the train back to Ottawa. The food was good, and service was very nice, albeit a tad flaky.  I went with a large custom salad $7.99 and added smoked salmon for an additional $1.49. I asked for spring mix and the lady who served me asked if I wanted a mix of all the greens they had. Me: \"uh, is that what spring mix means because I don't want any iceberg or romaine?\" Her: \"oh, you want the spring mix.\" Then she asked me if I wanted any protein with my salad and I said I wanted smoked salmon. She then proceeded to get a piece of chicken and started to cut it up when I said \"no, not chicken, smoked salmon.\" She said \"oh, sorry.\" She asked what additions I wanted, and thankfully got those right. The menu says you get a maximum of 4 additions, but she said I could have more if I wanted (like I said, she was super nice). I got tomatoes, cucumbers, chickpeas, mushrooms, yellow peppers and pickled beets. She asked what kind of dressing, and I said balsamic and I asked for the dressing on the side and she said \"yes\" then proceeded to pour the dressing in my salad! It was too late for me to say anything, so I let it go :( As a result, the salad was way too wet for my liking. However, I did get a good amount of smoked salmon. And I got a bonus falafel on top of my salad.  My husband saw the ordeal I went through with my order and so he had a pre-set salad instead. He ordered a small beet and apple salad, but I'm pretty sure they gave him a large because it was in the same size container as mine and they charged us for the large ($7.99).  Anyway, my salad was tasty, except for the too much salad dressing issue. Ingredients were fresh tasting and portions were generous.   We got there between 11:30am-11:45am on a Monday, so we beat the rush. I can see how this place is popular with the people who work nearby.   The place is underground, you cannot see it from the street. However, if you are walking on Bay St. once you see the building that is 220 Bay St. just go in and head downstairs and you'll see it.  Food is good and service is nice, you just need to watch and make sure you get what you order!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a couple of my friends. Picked up a large Hummus Salad to go  The staff is courteous and friendly. The large plastic container is misleading in my opinion. Looking at it I assumed I could easily finish it.  But they pack it in. The salad toppings plenty. The ingredients fresh. Two not so good things, the falafel seemed to have come from a factory and not store made and second the Hummus itself is grainy - I am used to smooth and full of flavour, may be some garlic, olive oil and some paprika. I could taste just chickpeas and hardly any tahini  Overall not a bad place. For $10 bucks large salad that I could hardly finish it"}
{"text":"Best salad and wrap place in financial district. I've been going here for over a year. The food quality and value is really good! The staff is very kind.    It's a bit difficult to find but if you see soup nutsy or print house then you are close. From the path, it's down a hallway. To get to it from outside you can go to 220 bay street and go through the rotating door then take the stairs down. It's right there."}
{"text":"I recently signed up with MEALPAL so I gave this place a try when they had Bibimbap today. This is a veggie Bibimbap with no meat at all. Just rice, veggies and a fried egg.  Taste is great but portion size is quite small. Will order it again though. Pick up was quick and easy  Solid 3 for me"}
{"text":"A little secret salad bar located on Bay & Wellington. Their forte is great price, generous portion, and friendly staffs. I usually change it up with Cobb salad, Lunch Special, or Nicoise salad. Usually, the food is a bit pricey in the PATH or financial district in general, so I couldn't be more happier to have found this gem and make sure you ask for the loyalty card - you get a free meal once you complete it! As for the direction, go into the SBI Canada Bank building (from the ground level) or walk straight down the hallway from Soup Nutsy and Bagel Stop (from the TD Centre concourse level)"}
{"text":"Good salads with healthy options. Variety of salads . Prices represent very good value (the large sizes are what most people get).  Best salad option in the path by far.  Debit or cash only"}
{"text":"Best salad / wrap place in the financial district. Fresh ingredients, multiple toppings, good portion, value, and great staff.   Locating the place is pretty straight forward, once you enter 220 Bay on the East side, follow the signs taking a immediate right to the basement. I really dont know why this place is located here, deserves a better location lol.    Recently got the lunch special salad went full vegan, falafel with no egg, added everything else. The staff were really nice, normally comes with chicken but due to my request she provided extra falafel's and sweet potato.   What can I say, had a great lunch. The sweet potato was on point. All the ingredients were fresh, avocados and lettuce were still green. They know what their doing.    Previously tried their chicken wrap. I personally liked their chicken. the pita was stuffed with toppings. Would advise to eat as soon as possible, things can get messy once the pita gets soggy.   Would recommend Mam Green Salad. Would definitely go back, got their loyalty card might as well.  ** No credit card :-("}
{"text":"First time coming here because I saw all the good reviews. It was a bit hard to find the place because it's in a secluded area. There are also not that many tables, so if it gets busy, you won't be able to get a seat. Since I went at around 2:00, there was no one there. But other than that, everything else was great! The food was great and fresh. The service was good. There was a man (whom I assume to be the owner) who gave us 2 cups and a free pop because he saw that we didn't have any drinks. He was very friendly and also started conversation with us. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Taste amazing. Super hard to find. Follow the path pass 222 Bay Street. You will see 200 Bay Street, go through a narrow dark corridor and there it is! So thought it was a convenience store when I first saw it lol"}
{"text":"Great little cafe for fresh salad. Served with friendly service and wonderful smile. Will definitely come again....."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for lunch! Great salads especially the cobb salad, chicken, falafels, hummus all in one. It is great value for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"I was hoping to find a salad place that wouldn't charge me an arm and a leg.  I did some research and found this place.  Thanks to Shirley L for pointing out that it is around the corner from Soup Nutsy or else I wouldn't be able to find it! Its actually hidden and you have to go through a set of doors.  It's located beside a barber shop and dry clean.  It seems like they've increased their price but I didn't get a chance to take a picture of the menu.  I got the Cobb salad and it cost a bit over $10 after tax.  I'm pretty happy that I get to choose the type of cheese because I dont eat Blue and it usually comes with it.  Huge portion and lots of toppings.  I got a stamp card so I'll come back for more!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Cobb salad. Portion is generous and salad is fresh. However it is quite watery and nothing really outstanding.   It came out as $11. There are a lot of other choices with better quality."}
{"text":"If you're familiar with Salad Days in Yorkville/Cumberland, this place is exactly the same. From the lunch special, to the menu layout, even to the plastic/styrofoam containers. What isn't the same are the prices, which are unfortunately priced at the financial district premium (the lunch special at Yorkville is around $6.50 vs $8.69 here..... And a small Cobb is $5 vs. $8........)   Most popular items are the lunch special and the Cobb salad. Both really good, but if you're watching your calorie intake, tell them to go easy on the sauces and dips because the regular amount is a little much and gets salty. That being said, say no when they ask if you want salt.   The line also moves way too slow, so I'd suggest using Ritual to order (you can also get $5 off if you use someone's invite code). Although no one is ever free near the cashier to help you pick up your Ritual order so be prepared to wait for that too...."}
{"text":"I was honestly very hesitant to write this review, because there is a selfish part of me that wants to keep this place a secret all to myself. It is a little bit hard to find, kind of around the corner from Soup Nutsy in the TD Tower in a neighbouring building. They make these incredible salads for a reasonable price, $7.99 + tax. I got a smoked salmon salad and watched them put so many pieces of smoked salmon in there (like 6-8) and the man took the time to arrange each piece artistically around a cherry tomato. The portions are also really big for what you pay and loaded with healthy and fresh and delicious ingredients. Since it's not like super well-known (for now), the wait is not too long as the people making salads are very efficient at what they do and are really nice. There is no other way to describe this place except as a hidden gem in the downtown PATH! Will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Came here first in 2015. Salad was AMAZING. Came by here a couple of months ago and it was terrible. Dressing was watered down. Salad was not even edible. Will not return even if salad was for free."}
