{"text":"IT IS THE WORSE PLACE EVER! DO NOT GO!  First of all, let me start by saying that the service there was horrendous. They almost had a full house and there were only two girls working. While the manager was sitting on his bum, talking on the phone, playing with this tablet. Ridiculous.  We had a group of 5 and they didn't give us the chance to choose from just regular hot pot which is 17.99 vs the lobster and seafood hot pot which is 22.99. So obviously without knowing and we thought the seafood was included in the 17.99 so we got scammed in paying more. By the way, only 2 of the girls can eat seafood, what a waste.   The portion of the food was very little. Again, you would think with a group of 5, they would at least give 5 pieces of whatever we order. No, this place gave out 3 pieces of what we ordered and then had to keep re-ordering. Also, when you're making your sauce, usually the main ingredient is soy sauce. They come around your table and pour that for you. You never had the freedom of just pouring it yourself. It's like its magical or something.  So pathetic.   This is the absolute worse part. Let me just say that tips are given based on the experience and service for me; none of which I got from this place. But even still, we tipped them a well 10% before tax. OH MY GOD. They have the audacity to come back to our table, threw the change down in front of us and said \"tips are not enough. It has to be after tax.\". We were SO shocked! Never have a restaurant EVER asked for more tips. THIS PLACE IS THE ABSOLUTE WORSE.  So what did we do? Grab all the big change and put down all small change for them to count. We're not rude people. Just expected something decent.   I purposely created a Yelp account to write this review. That's how bad the experience was."}
{"text":"We visited today Tuesday Jan 26, 2016 at ~7 pm. Outdoor temp minus 2. Only 2 tables were occupied. By the time we left at 9, there were 5 tables full.  2/5 - Quality of the ingredients Neutral on service 4/5 - Ventilation No raw eggs on the menu :(  # of items on the ingredients is kinda skimpy.  $17.99 + tax  Unlike some AYCE, tip is not automatically included.  Will definitely come back again ... in 2026."}
{"text":"I really wanted to enjoy this place but everything from seafood to beef was just- meh.  Different hot pot places are always a tricky place to try, especially when I'm ONLY there for the beef and peanut sauce. I have only been to 5 hot pots and that's not enough exploring but I want to spend my money on some good beef and peanut sauce. It really is difficult to find good peanut sauce when there aren't reviews on it.   Maybe I ought to make my own sauce and have hot pot alone, the thirst is real ."}
{"text":"When I first stepped foot into the restaurant I did not expect it to be authentic, but more or less it is.  You'll find asians there and prices are really well priced.  Their menu is extensive so I won't say they specialize in anything."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today with family. Decor is nice. Clean enough. Service is very rushed, although it's kinda expected for this kind of place so I wasn't too bothered by it although my mom was a bit annoyed. Food is a-OK. Prices are pretty cheap ($5-10/dish) so can't expect much. It's good enough for a quick lunch. They have a wide variety of selection, I got a HK style Portugese sauce spaghetti with chicken and the meat was decent. Rest of the dish just OK. My parents got the BBQ meat bento boxes and the meat was also decent. Servings on the generous side. Sisters got Korean dishes (stew and bibimbap), they said they've had better but it's a pass. BTW it's owned by the same owners as the K-BBQ next door so obviously the meat is the same.  I have not tried their hot pot yet, maybe will come back in the future to try. I wouldn't necessarily come back for lunch, although if I'm in a rush and in the area I might come back (although with the restaurant galore in this area I would probably try out some other places first). Bill came out to under $50 for 5 lunches including drinks and soup."}
{"text":"It's all about the beef for me when it comes to hot pot and the beef here is tough. The waiters were wearing Korean Grill House t-shirts so I'm guessing Made In China Hot Pot share the same owners.  I didn't like the communal sauce pot. And the way it's moved around its easy for raw juice foods to contaminate the sauce.  Service was slow - for a Monday night. Had to ask multiple times just for vegetables. The place wasn't that busy either. Only highlight was that they had corn on the cob and their curry fish balls and beef balls were decent.  I'm really surprised that this place scored higher than other hot pot places.   I'm not gonna be going back to this place.  You can get bottomless soft drinks for an extra dollar.  Soup base choices were pretty basic and you need to pay extra, at least $4, for different flavoured soups.  $13 Monday to Thursday for beef, $15 for seafood Monday to Thursday. I don't know what the prices are on the weekend.  Remember, everything I wrote was just my opinion. You may receive different service or you may experience the same thing. This was just my experience this particular night, I don't care to convince whether people come here or not. Just sharing my thoughts and experience.  I almost forgot to mention dessert, I ordered a mango dessert and it didn't taste or look like the other mango desserts I've tried at other hot pot or AYCE sushi places. It didn't taste right and I didn't even eat it.   As an aside, the name of the restaurant ironically matches the quality of the food: Why would anyone call it \"Made In China\" when that 'phrase' already has a negative connotation to it? But I digress..."}
{"text":"One of my usual go-to places for ayce hot pot. Food comes out quickly and drinks are included (plum juice or pop). Food is fresh and a plate of seafood is included. Also reasonably priced at $19.99 for dinner on weekends."}
{"text":"This place is just next to Szechuan Legend. We visited this place out of curiosity as we wanted to try something new during lunch time. Not knowing what to order, we chose the 2 set of $4.99 lunch special: Szechuan Beef and BBQ Chicken. The food arrived quickly and tasted good, above our expectation. The portions were big and they also came together with milk tea + soup.  We went again the next day for afternoon tea (2pm to 5pm), and got the $4.25 set. Very good deal, as it included a glass of dessert (red bean+ice cream+coconut).  Overall impression: Quick service, varieties (korean, chinese, hk, ramen), value-for-money.  We didn't try the dinner hot pot. That's said, we're very satisfied with their lunch and afternoon tea sets."}
{"text":"I went there to buy takeout and order 2 set lunch which come with free coffee or tea. The waiter told me there will be extra $0.25 for take out box, i understand this and yea, ok. but when they give me the bill they charge me totally 4*$0.25 for take out boxes. i ask and they said even the coffee cup, they will charge too. what the ?????   This is the first time i heard restaurant charging $0.25 for a take out a coffee cup. Sould i next time forced to give up the drink or even not buying take out from here anymore?"}
{"text":"They have all day breakfast! I wouldn't say the quality is comparable to other HK style breakfast cafes. It's just ok.  Parking can be tough as it gets later in the day."}
{"text":"This place really grows on you. Its got a nice wide variety of stuff, and the cooking is actually quite good. I have tried many of the items on the menu and the only thing i did not like as much was this white chicken on rice dish; its a cold chicken, which is just how its prepared, not my thing. Everything else is always great. Best dish is the MaPo Tofu.   I also like the ox tongue. Not allot of places u can that these days. The portugese chicken is also fantastic.   Definately a good place to go if u r super hungry. Portion sizes are very generous. Prices are very reasonable.   Owned by the same owners as the Korean Grill House next door to it. Its well managed and well run. I like it allot. Good for take out too."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed at my recent hot pot experience here! The quality of food and service definitely went down. First of all, many items are removed from the menu ( such as tang ho) . Second of all, it takes forever for the food to arrive. When the food does come, it is in ridiculously small portions ( I ordered fish balls, and I received a plate of TWO fish balls ..just TWO) . Third of all, the waitress tried all she could to ignore me when I try to wave her down to place an order. She also has NO expression on her face when I speak to her. She doesn't say anything when she puts food on the table or when she refills the soup. She is like walking dead and can't be bothered to even acknowledge customers. After an hour of waiting for food and small portions, we left hungry and frustrated.  I will never come back."}
{"text":"I went back tot his place last night.  Found out that after 10pm they have a special menu. All you can eat for $13.99 or if you want the deluxe version with all the seafood (salmon, shrimp, scallop, oyster), chicken, ribs, chinese veggies (spinach, watercress, enoki mushrooms, corn, and tong au), special side dishes like fried rice, its $16.99.   We were also not charged for ordering drinks (pop, prune juice).  The basic menu for $13.99 includes beef, tofu, deep fried tofu, fish balls, dumplings, nappa lettuce, winter melon, white raddish, green leaf lettuce, squid, tripe, pig intestine/stomach/kidneys, pig's blood, ox tongue, pig liver, imitation crab meat, ho fun noodles, vegetarian glass noodles, and dessert which includes ice cream.    We were stuffed by the end....there was no room for dessert.  We also smelled of hot pot since there was steam in our faces throughout the entire meal.  They accept credit card. My date paid.  I told him good thing he did, otherwise he'd never hear the end of it...that he didn't think i was special enough even to pay for the discounted night owl menu.  We both had a good laugh.  The service was excellent - they kept refilling our drinks and brought out the food very promptly.  The ambiance was nice - smells like cooked food but what else do you expect. We were seated in a booth but the place is spacious and well decorated. I would definitely go back.   We chose the cilantro and preserved egg broth. Last time we had the satay and it was too strong.  We also splurged and paid an extra $4 for dried scallop and winter melon broth. I asked for a spoon and practically drank that entire side - my $4 did not go to waste! It was the highlight of my meal."}
{"text":"I know the name of the place is called MADE IN CHINA HOT POT however they don't JUST serve hot pot here. Try out their LUNCH MENU! I always go there for their KBBQ Bento Boxes. You get to choose between beef, chicken or pork. You get some sticky rice, bean sprouts and some fried tofu and pickled carrots. I love coming here for lunch. It's cheap and the food isn't bad at all.   The decor at this location is pretty unique. Amble amount of seating and the service there is friendly and fast. I've never had to ask for refills on my tea or even try to get the attention of a server. It's like they know when you need something. Most of them speak Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese) however they do speak English just as well.   If only there were .5 points on this thing. I would give them a 3.5/5!"}
{"text":"Do not ever try their lunch or afternoon tea there, its actually terrible. The french toast i got there was the worst french toast I've ever ate and seen in my life. Hotpot there is below average, its cheap but its not good quality"}
{"text":"Would return for their hot pot.  Came here with a group of friends & had a good time.  Good soup base for the hot pot. Good selection of dipping sauces which u can mix at ur own table.  Friendly & attentive servers.  Welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"This hot pot restaurant is a part of a chain, and is associated with Korean Grill House. The restaurant had booths for 4 people, and long tables for couples, or big groups. My friend had made a reservation earlier in the week, as we were going as a group of 14. We were disappointed to discover that we would not be able to get individual pots, and that groups of 4 had to share one pot. We were able to split pots, but having over 16 soup bases, choosing two between 4 people was a bit challenging. Yes, these are first world hot pot problems, but for a true hot pot lover, this matters.   The order sheet was confusing, as the food items were listed in one big paragraph. You were also unable to state the quantity of the food you want, so we were forced with a lot of left over food. There was, however, a decent selection of food. All my go-to basic items were on the list. Everything tasted a bit frozen, even my fresh tofu. We had the seafood option, not because we were asked, but more so that it was imposed on us. On top of that, lobster is an additional $4 each, and comes with one small lobster tail per person. The seafood was limited to shrimp, salmon, and the $4 lobster. Needless to say, I was not impressed.   The soup base was decent. I had a split pot with preserved egg soup, and the tom yum soup base. The tom yum soup base was pretty good, and preserved egg soup was decent. My friend had the spicy soup, which was decent as well.   If you're a crazy hot pot lover like me, I would probably skip this place, wait in line at one of the more popular places for a better experience. However, if you have a big group, and have a late night craving for hot pot, this is your place. The service is good, and the food is okay. It would definitely satisfy that craving, that's for sure."}
{"text":"When it's freezing cold outside like -18 C, there's nothing better than hot pot.    At $18.95 a head for all you can eat, it's a steal!  You can choose from many types of meats, veggies, and even some seafood.  It's always busy, you gotta watch your servers, making sure that they bring exactly what you want.  We had to remind ours about three times what we were missing.  What happened in the end was we got about three orders of the same thing because we kept putting in new orders for things we were missing.  Oh man, 3 orders of taro in one shot and you are one full puppy!  IN the end, we had to waste some food because we just couldn't handle all of it.    DON'T order the lamb dumplings-crazy mutton flavour.  I had to spit it out.   DO order the fried gluten-chewy, and filled with broth, this I could have eaten 3 plates!   DO save some room for the mango pudding dessert.  It's about the size of a tablespoon, but it's creamy and refreshing.  You'll like it!"}
{"text":"Very different style from little sheep hot pot...  The hot pot: 3.5/5 - ok, so there are a list of broths you can choose from, the most basic ones are free, others you'd have to pay extra. Next they give you a sheet where you can place your order for a number of items. Since this place is right beside the korean grill house next door (and likely under the same management), I feel their cuts of meat are the same thickness as the ones used for kbbq. I'm not a fan of thick sliced meat for hotpot so this where I mentally took points off for this review. Also, since I'm a huge fan of the buffet style of hotpot that little sheep on warden has, it was hard for me to place an order for an item and leaving me to guess how much \"1 serving\" was. The vegetables come in a good size portion, while the meat is a pretty small serving since they come in the small square kbbq containers that are used at the grill house xD Although I did enjoy the tray of sauces that was shared at each table so you never really had to get up at any point in your meal unless heading to the washroom :P  Cost: 3.5/5 - more pricey than little sheep :(  Service: 3/5 - what I hate about handing in sheets is waiting for the waiter to notice you have one to hand in. Sometimes they noticed right away, others didn't notice you were flagging them down because they were so busy. Service wasn't particularly poor, but they could have been more attentive.   Ambience: 4/5 - typical hot pot. Nice decor, pots and the table was good! Perhaps alittle cramped, but still a good environment to eat in."}
{"text":"I come here regularly and although the quality can sometimes be a hit or miss, it always satisfies my hot pot craving.   Food: pig's blood, pork intestines, beef tripe, oh my, if it can be boiled in the delicious soup broth I will eat it. Variety is pretty good here with all the key staples ( i.e beef/lamb slices, beef balls, large veggie selection ( although quality can be iffy), and assorted noodles). The Satay broth is really tasty and not as oily as other places I've been to. The dip selection is also really good and i like how the dips are in trays and dropped off at your table. I also like that drinks ( including pop and plum drink) are included in the price and they also offer ice cream among other desserts on the AYCE menu.   I only wish they offered more unlimited seafood on their menu. You get a *free* seafood platter but it only includes 1 shrimp, 1 oyster, 1 salmon ,1 mussel and 1 fish paste per person. A couple other places offer unlimited shrimp and that would make this place 5 stars for me if they offered that.   Service: servers provide limited eye contact and do not check up on you (as with most Chinese establishments) but they have a lot of staff and it's quite easy to flag someone down to get something."}
{"text":"hot pot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  so fancy, this was my first time and it was the beeeeesst!  for 17.95 (15.95 weeknights) you get all you can eat everything, drinks (soda styles) and desserts. we thankfully had a guide : but in case you need info here is how to play it:   1. pick your broths that will be cooking your meats and veg - we chose satay (curry flavor), pork and chicken, pickled egg and cilantro (mild flavor) and spicy scheczuan (a bit extra, but so worth it. by faaar my favorite one).   2. pick your meats - honestly all five of us went absolutely nuts for the lamb, and we almost didn't order it! also great : the beef, pork, pork balls.. there's a lot more choices - but they are for bold eaters (pork intestines, pork blood, etc)  3. pick your veg - all are great - the Chinese cabbage, sweet corn on the cob, lotus root.. tofu. yum  4. pick your accessories -- noodles are a must! the udon and singapore style were fat and delicious. we also tried vermicelli. don't forget to add wontons and potstickers. soo tasty. we also tried the sticky fried rice and chicken and mushroom rice. also great.   5.  make a dipping sauce -- as you wait for your food to arrive, you will see a tray of different soy sauces, vinegars, sesame oil, garlic etc.. you can combine these in any way you like, and later use it to dip your hot potted delicacies into.  6. get super excited. your hotpot is about to arrive. its a bit intense at first, there is so much food, action, excitement. stay calm , breathe :)  pick what you want to try, and start dunking it in the broths. there are different cook times depending on the food, meat usually goes within 30 seconds, veggies a minute  or two.   things specific to this restaurant :   a seafood platter (with salmon, shrimps, huge oysters, mussels, etc) comes at the very beginning of the meal which is included in the cost.  if you are not a fan, tell the waiter beforehand that you don't want it because you can't get anything to go.  you also get many uncooked eggs, that are to be dunked into the pot and left for like 10 -15min and they come out as tasty hard boiled treats.   after steps 1 - 6, repeat over and over again. until you can't fit anymore hotpot into your belly!"}
{"text":"Get the Szechuan sauce if you get hot pot and make a soy sauce dip =]"}
{"text":"Probably the only hot pot restaurant that opens until 2:00 AM on weeknights! I work late shifts and can't get dinner until 9:30 PM so I am super happy this place closes late. The food is alright, nothing special. I'm just happy about how late it closes.."}
{"text":"I went during the day on a weekend and seeing that there aren't many hot pot places open then it really makes them stand out.   The prices are split between meat only or meat with seafood. The meat with seafood package includes AYCE fountain drinks and fresh seafood such as lobster, shrimp and mussels. The rest veggies and meat are ayce and split in a small portion manner. So no left overs.  They are run by the same owner of Korean Grill House so it has the same atmosphere and type of service. Even the serving plates are the same.   Parking is fair and commerce gate plaza has an underground lot. Keep in mind they have a Chatime here so they can get crazy busy.  They also serve a la carte items too and a good place if you're looking for Chinese cafe style.  Anyways I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Another lunch, another Asian place. I've been here a few times now over the past year or two, and have had mixed experiences. It really depends on what I've ordered. Thus, an average score of 3.   Of all the times that I've been here, I've never had to wait for a table. This particular visit was on a Friday (lunch time) and I was feeling something higher on the comfort scale, so I decided to go with a place of \"Hoi Nan Chicken with Chicken Oil Rice\". Sounds like a dish which is great for your arteries, right? =) On a side note, it costs an extra $0.25 for take out.   The dish is simply presented: the chicken arrived with its skin glistening from a light brushing of oil, neatly arranged beside an upturned bowl of rice, with an assortment of three dipping sauces and a few pickled vegetables (radishes and carrots). The chicken was all dark meat, with silky, smooth, gelatinous skin. The same silky smoothness was present in the meat also. The dome of rice took on the sweet flavour of the chicken and held together well enough to pick up with chopsticks from a plate. Of the three dipping sauces, I found that the ginger + oil was very light in flavour, and preferred the vinegar based sauce. I also enjoyed periodically eating the pickled vegetables, as it cut through the oil, and offered a bit of a palette cleanse. After eating some of the pickled veges, it's like starting the meal all over again.  This dish is definitely one of the better ones that I've had from here and would recommend."}
{"text":"It's the worst hot pot I've ever eat. the beef and lamb is terrible. and its expensive. I will not coming back soon"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a no-star. I certainly would.   My friends and I came here on a sunday evening around 5pm for an early dinner. We came here on my friend's suggestion. At a first glance, It looked good. But as time went on, I became more unimpressed.   For 5pm on a sunday, this place was EMPTY. Considering that, you'd expect that the employees be a little more attentive, since they have no one else to attend to. Wrong. They were only helpful when we called for them. Typical for an Asian place right? I guess. Keep reading if you want the real knitty gritty. It get's worse.  Their selection of food is not bad, they have all the typical staples of a AYCE hot pot place, the quality wasn't bad. Not the best though. Ordering is through a form, and the servers brought you the food. So you're thinking, okay, sounds like a mediocre Asian place? Correct.  It wasn't until we saw a COCKROACH on the wall next to our booth, where I completely lost my appetite. It went from hungry, to zero. So it wasn't in our food, or in our soup. But who knows? That cockroach must've came from somewhere?  This cockroach hid in the crack of the wall during our entire meal. It eventually came out, and one of the people in the party were were in, killed it.  Please keep in mind, a waiter full saw this happening. And shrugged it off, as if it were nothing.  So...if you want to have a meal with a cockroach by your side. I highly suggest this place. Otherwise. Stay away. I'm honestly surprised this place hasn't had the red safety food regulation posted on the outside of their door."}
{"text":"If I were a girl, and was into decorating my cellphone with things like Hello Kitty accessories, and bedazzling everything I own, then I would certainly consider this place to be upscale, and very \"cute.\"  But I'm not, I'm a 6 foot 1, 200+ pound Chinese who enjoys cigars, fine wine, and Opera...so let the review begin. Made in China Hotpot is.......a kinda upscale and cute place -_-  It looks like a sushi restaurant, it just feels that one should be eating sushi here. It's not very Japanese, but I never seen such a meticulously decorated restaurant for hotpot, as hotpot is messy business. Even the trays which the food comes in looked like sashimi platters. The place was clean, and the seating was intimate. So I was worried on how much I'd end up paying for a place like this.   I came here with about fifteen second-year UTSC students, so entertaining a crowd was a piece of cake, and damn did I ever put these kids to work..I didn't cook a single thing. The spices are secured in a metal ball, so it doesn't end up in your food when scooping it into your bowl, this was clever. I think I had the largest party there, but despite being sat across a long table, we were all able to converse rather comfortably with one another.  You had a choice how to personalize your sauces, but I was busy hitting on the girls sat around me. I'm not usually the oldest person in a crowd, but being cultured has it's perks in a situation like this. I don't think anyone else has made hotpot history more interesting than I. Maybe it's my deep raspy voice..or my throaty laugh......  You can order anything here, fish balls, chicken wings, honestly anything. They all taste very good from the sauces. It's all reasonably priced. I'm content.   Made in China, with Pride baby!"}
{"text":"Best hot pot I had all my life. I was kind of thrown off by the name because stuff made in china are usually made cheaply and not of good quality, but it turns out to be amazing. The service was friendly and the food was good. I mean all I can say is that this is one of the best hot pots there is in Toronto."}
{"text":"If I'm not having hot pot at home or at a friend's house, this is the place to go. Very reasonable price, and true unlimited all you can eat experience. They have a constant supply of beef and lamb, and specialty hot pot items like fried gluten, pig intestines, and pork blood jelly. If you're into that, this is definitely worth a try.  One only thing is you might need to make an little effort to get the server's attention if it gets busy. But they are polite, well mannered and provide good service whenever they can."}
{"text":"There are sooooooo many hot pot restaurants in Richmond hill. I don't get how they all sustain given the stiff competition.  Food here is blah. Just whatever. I may be overly critical cause I'm not a huge hot pot fan. I don't see any value in it and I don't think it's that great."}
{"text":"One's preconceive notion of thinking that this is a furniture shop will be surprised that it's actually a restaurant. I didn't know that this was a restaurant at first, the name just sprouts out a store that sells furniture or any Chinese-related stuff but going in for the first time, the decor just looks fantastic even though places like Go For Tea establishes that even elegant and attractive decor doesn't necessary mean that you're going to have a great time here. What I saw is a hong style cafe that serves breakfast all day and specials that are affordable which is the best considering that I love eating breakfast.   Although when I found out that the owner is the same owner of the Korean BBQ next door, it wasn't really surprised that it would look good. Anyways the service was attentive even though I came here around ten o'clock on a weekday where the restaurant is completely empty.   It was good that they aren't like Go For Tea in a sense of attractive decor but terrible service, as I ordered a two eggs, bacon and 2 toasts and hong kong hot milk tea (with a sideorder of a hashbrown) and it didn't take that long for it. The presentation of the food looks neat, with square-shaped plates and I like it when they organised the portions well.   As for the food, the sunny-side eggs aren't really cooked enough to the point of only having the yolk be the liquid part, it really disgusts me if someone doesn't know how to cook a sunny-side egg to the point where you don't see white snot pouring with the yolk but aside from that the eggs are good. The bacon is also great complimenting the eggs and toast especially when you eat them all at once. The hashbrown however didn't taste like a hashbrown at all, it just taste like plastic and even McDonalds hashbrowns are better. The hot milk tea really hits the spot when you finished the meal.  For four dollars (with the hashbrowns), the meal is overall excellent, I really like this than the small bakery cafe near Finch Avenue West that serves breakfast all day as well.   Now that there's a place with breakfast all day I could easily see me coming here over and over again!  Pros: attentive and great service, breakfast all day, beautiful decor and affordable pricing.  Cons: not completely cooked egg"}
{"text":"This is a late review but I came here on January 28th 2016 with my boyfriend (I remember the date clearly because this place caused us to miss an event during the weekend) I've been here twice and that day was my second time. We had a good experience the first time around but the second time around caused us big problems. I quickly got food poisoning a day after and at first I thought it was just me eating something bad somewhere else the day of. But NOPE a couple hours later my boyfriend told me he felt very sick and puked out A couple times. Now the only time we ate together was the day we went here and there is no way that it could be a coincidence we get food poisoning around the same time for no reason. Now I know many might assume we didn't cook our food properly but WE DID we never had a problem with hot pot cooking...if anything, we over cook things cause we leave it in there for too long. I'm guessing that something wasn't treated properly raw or was contaminated that day. We were going to reach out to the provincial health authorities but really who has time for that. Just make sure your food is clean before cooking but don't expect much from these chain ayce hotpot places. Service wise on the other hand was okay...I had a better time the first time around where the waited kept filling up our water and made sure everything was okay. But I guess since we went near to closing the second time the food might've been un-fresh or something. They were even mopping right beside us while we were still eating... This experience definitely scarred me and I don't think I can ever enjoy hot pot the same."}
{"text":"This is a very convenient location to get HK style tea and BBQ grilled food. We dropped by for a quick lunch on a Saturday May 12  Service and vibe are smooth and pleasant. A compliment to give is that the owner did hire politely smart employees, they response fast and meet the diners' attentions.    Ok. How about the food, lets gossip about the main issue:  We ordered a fish base noodle with fish slices and a fried chicken thigh. These choices come with drinks as HK style always offers.   It got me a little bit disappointed when the food came to the table.    Our fries chicken thigh is not fried , it is a soy sauce marinated type.  Our fish noodle comes with beef balls and beef organs and fish slices.  We inquired about fish noodle and how beef also includes in our order.  Then our server told us politely this is how chef cooked it in this way.  So we were not sure if we would return because it is quite a big flaw for me if they cannot keep up the actual order from the menu. For fish-only diners or food specific diners, this is a big confusion."}
{"text":"I didn't try the hot pot, but I did ordered their take out which was surprisingly good!!! I ordered the baked chicken tomato rice and the fried noodles. Both were decent priced for under $10. They even come with a drink too. I will def come back for their lunch specials.   The parking for this place is horrendous, not surprised though... Since it is a Chinese plaza with as a in drivers....... But hey they do have some decent food in this plaza so I do come here quite often"}
{"text":"The selection of hot pot items at Made in China are significantly fewer than those of the higher-end hot pot restaurants, but like I said, it's not terrible and includes the bare minimum of fish balls, tofu, beef, lamb, chicken wings, veggies, etc.  It's all very standard choices.  The only problem was that after we submitted our order sheet with the items we wanted, it took an awfully long time for the vegetables to arrive.   Everything else from the order sheet had arrived except for the green leafy vegetables.  We had wanted to eat more vegetables that night but since the leafy greens took so much longer to arrive, we ended up being more full with the other items than we would have liked to be.  I liked that they provided a free beverage.  Naturally, I chose the plum juice (always so fitting at hot pot meals!).  Other than the late arrival of the green vegetables to our table, I actually have to say that the service here was very good.  The male server was very attentive and alert to when we needed him to bring items for us.  It seemed like they really cared about customers.  This was a nice meal to try a Made in China hot pot restaurant.  In the future though, if I want more selection and unique hot pot items, I'll opt for the higher-end hot pot restaurants (which are so plentiful these days in the Markham and Richmond Hill area)."}
{"text":"Excellent my first time at this hot pot establishment.  Soft drinks are free, and they have a great assortment of seasonings/spices for you to choose from.  The menu itself is quite complete and they give each person a serving of different seafood items.  The service at times wasn't the best due to the waiter losing an order or two, but since it's all you can eat, you can just reorder the item and it'll appear!  Great decor of white bird nests around the lighting area, and quite modern.  Excellent place to bring your friends and family!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars really. Came here with my dad on a saturday night. I was hesitant to come here because the last time I went I ended up getting terrible food poisoning. But, decided to give it another try.   It was 19.99 for AYCE beef and seafood (not AYCE). The food was good, there is a lot of variety and it comes with refillable fountain drinks and dessert. I like how you can make your own sauce mix.   The service was pretty bad. There was a ton of waiting, for a table (even though there were open ones), for a MENU (really?) and for the food and bill. The waiters weren't really attentive and it was nearly impossible to flag them down. It really dampens the whole experience.   Overall, food was good so I'd give it another try."}
{"text":"Really? only 3 stars for this place?? Well I had an excellent experience here and coming from Montreal, we don't have many hot pot joints! I really loved this place how they give so many choices of sauces to dip and also a variety of seafood/meats etc. The service was okay but the hot pot broth (which there is so many options!) was pretty solid to me. In terms of service, I hate to sound like I am generalizing...okay I am totally generalizing but anyways! Asian spots, I have a lower standard for their service like Chinatown restaurants or something, because! Why? They usually don't give top notch service anyways! It's not the same caliber as let's say...fine dining restaurants or something. It isn't a bad thing, but it's just the way it is from all my experiences in Asian restaurants (casual that is) I am totally digressing and this review is turning into a rant.   OKAY back to the actual review of the food, all in all...it was very satisfying and tasty. Spacious atmosphere and cool casual ambiance. Definitely worth visiting Markham for this hot pot place!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome and it's cheap too! Less than $20 for ayce hot pot and you can make your own sauce as well. There's a decent variety of veggies and meat. However, just wish they had enoki mushrooms! Service is also not bad, sometimes hard to get the server's attention but overall it's not too hard when it's not busy."}
{"text":"Contrary to its name, this place serves more than Hot Pot.   They serve a small menu of Hong Kong cafe items between 2:30-5:30pm. What makes it different than other HK cafe in the area are the choice of \"ice cream coconut red bean\" or \"ice cream coconut grass jelly\" drink as part of the meal at no extra cost! You can still opt for hot coffee or milk tea if you like.   Their minced beef spaghetti, wanton noodle soup and satay beef noodle soup were all tasty! But small portion sizes, that's reflected in the cheap price. Fills you up perfectly till dinner (hence the 2:30-5:30pm menu).  Side note: they are related to the Korean BBQ next door."}
{"text":"Came here with friends for an early lunch. At first I thought we were having hot pot, given the name of the restaurant. However, I was quite surprised with their other food offerings.   The venue wise, it has that strong hot pot smell even in the early brunch hours from the previous night(s). So that scent was a bit overpowering. Aside from that the tables and walking areas are quite clean.  One thing I find it confusing was the overwhelming amount of choices for a lunch menu. My friends and I didn't know what to decide on. So I ended up picking the Singaporean rice noodle. And to my surprise they made it pretty decent. It wasn't just \"slapped on some meat and the curry powder\" kind. But it was actually not bad. Further to this, the dish was HUGE as the picture shows.   Service wise, it's not bad? But nothing wowing honestly. One thing though, and it isn't the restaurant owner's fault. The parking is absolutely horrid."}
{"text":"Reviewing for afternoon tea.    While they specialize in hot pot, they have a great lunch/afternoon tea selection for a great price. We especially enjoy their Ma Po Tofu rice and their lunch boxes. The only downside is that their food tends to be a bit too greasy and salty.  http://www.theroadtripgirl.com/under-10-meals-my-top-hk-cafes-for-afternoon-tea/"}
{"text":"My cousin suggested this place for dinner, as we tend to always veer towards the same restaurants. However, we've done hot pot at my dad's, so the concept was nothing new to us. Still it was nice to experience it in a restaurant setting. As soon as we were seated, they brought a tray of different sauces for us. I am OBSESSED with chili oil, so I was happy to see it as an option. It is a pretty spacious place, but was not very populated for a Saturday evening. The servers were familiar, as I frequent Korean Grill House next door and they are employed there as well. All of them recognized me, which was nice but also embarrassing lol....I kind of felt like I was cheating on Korean BBQ, even though they are owned by the same people.   We were given two pots for 6 of us, which meant we were permitted to choose 4 soup bases. We went for the Satay, Chicken & Pork Broth, Szechwan Style Spicy, and Preserved Egg & Cilantro. To be honest, I dipped all my food in the chili oil after it was cooked, so the broth wouldn't have made a difference to me. Still nice to be able to choose though. The ordering system was very similar to Korean Grill House, where you choose from a list and mark it on the paper. We ordered everything on the menu that we thought sounded appetizing. As soon as the trays started hitting the table, I took a few photos but then my hunger and excitement took over and I immediately started throwing everything into the pots. Everything was so delicious. I did not indulge in any of the rice or noodles as I am still avoiding them for another few weeks - my cousins seemed to enjoy them though. I mostly enjoyed the curry fish balls (appetizers), beef, beef tripe, pork, crab meat, sausage, squid ball & Japanese fish balls. They had brought out some mussels and salmon that we didn't realize were a one-time thing per table and were not included in the AYCE menu. Unfortunately because I did not know this, I didn't get to try any. Apparently, they were also delicious. I can't remember the cost of the dinner but we paid $33.50 each - this included the dinner, a pitcher of beer, soft drinks and a service charge. I really enjoyed the food and experience here. I'm actually craving it while writing this. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a very long time.  They have a great selection  for hot pot.  For dinner you get a seafood tray.  Great and fast service everytime."}
{"text":"First time here I order the pork bone congee and fried noodle. The fried donut that came with it was disgusting. It was hard and oily. It's definitely over night garbage. The congee tasted so much flour mix was also disgusting. The one pork bone that was in it was pure bone. No taste at all. Here is a one star for the fried noodle. Never come here again."}
{"text":"I love the decorations here, it looks great for a hot pot place and its very nice and clean, definitely not what you would think the inside would look like judging from the name of this place. We had all you can eat hot pot and I really like how they give us many sauces to create our own sauce from it and you can even ask for raw eggs to create your masterpiece!   The price for AYCE hot pot is great! We were very very full! selection is not the best, but it is still good selection! and The meat is fresh (as in frozen and not defrosted and mushy) I like the handmade fish balls and there is a seafood platter when you start, also a man came around with a few special dishes (i guess these are limited depending on the day) and I opted for the dish with salmon head in it. I love salmon head haha, usually grilled at Japanese restaurants but it still tastes good hot pot also."}
{"text":"We have only been there for the lunch specials so far and not the hot pot.  We have tried many of the lunch specials over the last few weeks and they are consistently very good including the chicken and mushroom rice and the beef noodle soup.  The service is friendly and attentive.  It's our go to place now for a quick and reasonable priced Chinese rice or noodle lunch special."}
{"text":"This is so far my favourite hot pot restaurants in TO. All of the waiters and managers provided prompt, courteous and great customer service, which is not common in most Asian restaurants. They have a wide variety of fresh hot pot ingredients from vegetables, frozen meat slices to vermicelli and different kinds of noodles. My friends and I dine at this place about twice a month, and every time we went there we always had a great dining experience. Yesterday we went there again for our New Year's Eve dinner, and we had a great time eating there. The only thing I would like to suggest to them is to put soy sauce at each table instead of having to wave down the waiters to pour it into your bowl for you. I also hope they can perhaps install a hot pot sauce mixing station where guests can go there and scoop the types of dipping sauces they want, instead of having trays of small dipping sauces that run out fast when there are a lot of guests per table."}
{"text":"Due to Market Fluctuations(i.e. Disappointing Late-night offering[$13.99 after 10pm]), Made in China Hot Pot has dropped 2 Basis-points(Stars) overnight. **shakes head** All-you-can-eat Fantasyland dream shattered, I wish it didn't have to happen this way."}
{"text":"Quality food provided for the hot pot. I went on family day around 1pm and found it pretty busy and crowded but the yummy food made up for it. Because it was so busy at times they forgot some of the food items we requested but when we brought it to their attention they apologized and brought it straight away. Overall good experience and would go again."}
{"text":"Does this review belong to Korean Grill House next door, or does it belong here? Probably here, because I ate it here.   Came for lunch. Ordered a la carte. What's kinda cool is that the Korean Grill House menu is here during lunch, and we got to order from it. They have lunch bento boxes that begin at $5.99 (grilled pork or chicken). I ordered the chicken. It came with a good amount of rice, chicken, marinated fried tofu bites, pickled radish and carrot, and sprouts. It was also served with a bowl of beef broth, and a drink (Horlicks, etc. costs an extra $0.50, and cold drinks are $1.00 and up). Tasty and cheap! Service was not bad. Efficient. Would come again."}
{"text":"love hot pot!   for all you can eat, 16.99 isn't really that bad on a week night. all the items you have to request from the server - I would like to think they're fresher (instead of those other hot pot places where all the veggies and meat sit in a rack in a fridge, who knows how long they been sitting there)  cute decor, yum!"}
{"text":"Decor: Very cute. I love the hanging bird cages and other Chinese decors!   Food: I absolutely love the Asian style condiments they provide to you. So many varieties. They also have many soup bases that you can choose from and a good variety of different ingredients/ dishes you can choose to put into your hot pot. I love that they give you a sheet to fill out what you want instead of having to call the waiter over and name out one by one what you want. I think it's much more efficient.   Dishes I recommend: Beef tendon (make sure you leave it there long enough so it's soft and chewable, and you will want to let it cool down a bit before you put it in your mouth to avoid burning), wonton, octopus balls   Cleanliness: No problems so far. ALTHOUGH... I have to admit, I saw a rat run by my table a few years ago when I was at their sister restaurant next door (Korean BBQ). They blamed it on the grocery store next to them at that time... but no matter what, that's doesn't make it ok for the rat to appear. So just keep an open eye next time you are there!"}
{"text":"AYCE dinner was 17.99 for adults and 9.99 for kids, which was a decent price tag for the amount of food you get.  However, the freshness and quality of the food was questionable, maybe it is because I went for Hotpot in the summer( I know, who does that right?), but the veggies were definitely going bad.  There were only two tables in the entire restaurant for the 1.5 hrs I was there, and service was not extremely prompt.   Yeah, not my favourite place, but cheap compared to other AYCE I guess."}
{"text":"I find myself looking for restaurants close to Chatime so I can grab my tea after a good meal.  As a result, I have been to 5 of the restaurants in the Commerce Gate complex.  I had looked at Made in China many times, since it is directly across from Chatime.  It was about time I tried it!  I've had a couple of the lunch specials, a chow mein dish and a fried rice. A good  sized portion, good flavour, and fast service.  So far, I'm stuck on lunches, but the hot pot angle intrigues me. Based on the lunches I've had, I will be making time for dinner!"}
{"text":"Ordered the fried fish filet with salad (part of their afternoon tea menu) and paid $7 for 2 tiny pieces of filet and barely any salad (plus a hot milk tea - 25cents extra)... Consider putting them in a smaller take out box perhaps? To make the portion look slightly bigger?"}
{"text":"I absolutely love hot pot, and I'm always on the hunt for the best hot pot restaurant in the GTA. I will drive 40 minutes from downtown to fulfill my search, but needless to say, this one doesn't make it to the top of my list.  Let's start with the positives. The service was good, the servers were proficient in English and were able to answer any questions we had about the menu. The quality of the food was alright, the meat wasn't the best I've had but it wasn't bad by any means. The restaurant is clean, and the place can accommodate fairly large groups - but all the tables are rectangular so you may have to shout across the table to converse with a person on the other side.  So now the issues. The place was pretty empty on a Saturday night, which is not really a good sign for any restaurant - probably because there are too many competitors nearby that are slightly better. They do not offer individual pots, you have to share with your group (one pot per 3-4 people). I personally prefer individual pots so that I can choose the soup base I want and my soup wouldn't be contaminated with any flavours that I don't like from other ingredients, but I know not all hot pot places can offer it. BUT communal hot pot places usually offset this setback by lowering their price - which this place does not do. It was about $30 for the hot pot, which is exactly the price I would be paying for at another hot pot restaurant with individual pots.  The price includes a seafood platter, which comes with oysters or lobster (+$3), which is a nice addition, BUT and this is a huge but, it is a FORCED addition. I find that bizarre, as a lot of people I know don't like seafood and yet are forced to pay for it. During certain times, you can order just a regular hot pot without seafood but I don't know why that option had to be time-restricted.  Another bizarre aspect of the restaurant is their ordering system. It is a paper and pencil ordering system, and they were good about giving us everything we ordered, but why are we not able to write out the portions beside each ingredient? You're asked to fill out the portion beside each category (vegetable, meat, noodles etc.), which doesn't make any sense. Why can't I order more lamb than beef? Why do I have to get equal amounts of both? It just made no sense to me and they really should fix their ordering forms.  The selection of items was adequate - not the largest selection I've seen, but large enough that you'll likely find everything you want on there (no quail egg though :(, which happens to be my favourite). It's also kinda nice that they offer appetizers (e.g., curry fish balls, curry beef balls) and rice dishes (e.g., chicken mushroom rice) as part of their all-you-can-eat menu along with non-alcoholic drinks and dessert (e.g., ice cream, tapioca and fruit).  Overall, I think that they have the basic necessities of what makes a good hot pot restaurant, but they will need to make some adjustments to compete with the slew of nearby hotpot restaurants."}
{"text":"Made in China Hot Pot is the hot pot place that you go to when you just don't care. The place itself is HUGE and there's tables everywhere so I don't think you'll need to worry about it filling up. We arrived pretty late and there was still lots of room. The menu isn't only hot pot as there are small box meals as well. The hot pot menu has a nice variety of sauces but most of the good ones are $5 extra.   We opted for the satay and chicken/pork broth combo in a mix and match. The broth was disappointing as I found the chicken/pork broth bland and the satay had a funky kind of taste. The menu of options for the hot pot wasn't that great, but at least it had all the staples that you look for. The other problem is that the quality of the items weren't the greatest. The lamb and beef were decent enough, but the pork and chicken were awful. They also come with a plate of seafood options being some salmon slices, oysters, mussels, and shrimp (shell on). They also offer some other items like appetizers (curry balls of beef, squid, pork, etc) and items to throw in like crab meat, veggies, noodles, wontons, and dumplings.   Prices are standard and they have a nice selection of soup bases, but I don't like that you have to pay extra for sichuan spicy base or some others as well. For the quality of the food, I'm not sure I'll be back. Better places to go to."}
{"text":"Who knew they had breakfast here??... Not that I go out much for breakfast but it's neat to see that they have a variety of offering. I always like how spacious the restaurant is, especially once the steam starts up. So for breakfast, I had their bodies and toast. Warning, the thick toast is not hong Kong style thick toast. Is literally a thick piece of bread. Not bad or anything, but just not what you might be expecting. Food is average. Nothing special but definitely not bad. :)  I've also had hot pot here before. Again, not bad. Service is fast and it's good value. :) nothing special, but good for lazy days in the winter."}
{"text":"AYCE hot pot tends to get pretty pricey, but this place goes easy on your wallet without sacrificing (too much) quality. We came on a Tuesday night and the place wasn't busy at all; food came quickly with very few dropped items and the waiters were all friendly and reasonably attentive.  For $17.99 a person (drinks included), you get a plate of seafood and unlimited orders of meats, balls, vegetables, noodles, etc. Sauces come to your table in a large tray at the beginning of the meal and there are a number of soup bases to choose from, 3 of which are free while the rest cost around $5-6. Variety of ingredients is decent but the dessert section of the menu is noticeably lacking. The fish balls were also disappointing - curry balls were too bland, fried balls were too salty - but everything else we ordered was great.  Although the quality/freshness of ingredients isn't as good as that of some other hot pot restaurants, it's at least average and you still get awesome value for your money. Definitely a solid choice that will satisfy any hot pot craving!"}
{"text":"this joint is really two restaurants in one.  one side is the korean style bbq the other is a really interesting, a mixture of hong kong style and szechuan style and something in between.  all good.  they serve breakfast and lunch.  amazing prices and waiting staff.  it's very spacious and the food comes to you very quickly.  their hong kong style tea is one of the best i have ever had.  i have had a lot of them and this place really serves perfectly made hong kong style tea.  they have set lunch menus that start from $4.99 to $6.99, they include a soup and the aforementioned tea.  the soup is freaking awesome too.  actually there are two kinds of soups, get the spicy tomato soup.  washroom is pretty clean.  if you want to go for a fast lunch that is not too expensive, go here!!!   oh....i forgot to mention that the food is cooked with a lot of ingredients and spices, you can really taste the different layers of spices and flavours.  go!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast and I ordered a cold drink. On the breakfast menu, it stated that cold drinks are $0.75 extra but my bill showed $1.00 extra instead. I asked the staff he said it's a dollar extra, it's a typo on menu. Please. Either reprint all the menu or put sticker on and change all to $1 instead of ripping people like this."}
{"text":"Tuesday dinner...AYCE $20.99/person and includes soft drinks, not bad. But some soup bases are additional $3-5. We got 2 pots, 4 flavors for 6 adults.  U get one seafood platter which is a one time thing. It had mussels, oysters, shrimp, salmon, and emoji mushrooms. The oysters were my favorite.  U have a choice of beef and lamb for meat, decent quality but nothing spectacular.  Other varieties include ur typical veggies, fish ball assortment, tofu, etc. The fried fish ball was nice and chewy. They also seem to have made their own fried gluten puff.  Overall average, decent AYCE hot pot. Soup flavors were okay, well salted but not special in flavor otherwise."}
{"text":"This is a quiet little restaurant right next to a very busy Korean Grill House. The menu consists of basic/classic dishes, like fried rice and curry platters, and in the evening, they switch to a menu that includes bibimbap and sizzling platters. I chose to have their seafood casserole spaghetti. I've had this type of dish before at Cafe Hollywood, and they're pretty much the same aside from Cafe Hollywood's portion being much bigger. It was cooked well and there was a good variety of seafood. The servers are very friendly and the place seems very clean and quiet compared to the bustling nature of most of the Midland and Finch plaza. While it is a nice restaurant, it's nothing particularly special."}
{"text":"There wasn't much of a food variety for the hot pot ayce menu and they only give you one small plate of seafood. BUT! Their desserts surprised me the most. I haven't had legitimate strawberry icecream at an ayce restaurant in so long - y'know, the ones with the strawberry chunks. And their jello doesn't taste like water. So props to them."}
{"text":"Okay I have a real problem with businesses that decide to change their hours of operations willy nilly. Especially when they have an after 10 pm special and they won't seat us after 10 because they're gunna close as soon as the other tables leave. We walk in 10:13, expect to get seated because we came specifically for the after 10 pm special. What we got was, we're closing at 11. \"Excuse me?\" So does this mean leave because u won't finish ur food in time, doesn't make sense. And I'm like the hours specifically said 12. Oh we don't have enough customers tonight. So we left clearly not wanted. If that's how you treat your customers OF COURSE you don't have any."}
{"text":"While I was there when it was packed, the manager does nothing but yell at his workers to pick up the pace in a domineering attitude, shouting commands rudely as if his workers were his slaves who are obligated to obey his every command. I tried to give tips to the waiter, but he said he can't accept tips personally and must surrender all of his tips to the manager. No wonder service is always so terrible here."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place. Good variety of food. Even though the name says hot pot, they do serve \"regular\" food.  Hot pot was also surprisingly decent and had a pretty good variety of food"}
{"text":"My usual go to hot pot fix in Toronto is my home. However when I'm too lazy I usually go to Kim Tao! On this occasion  I decided to give China Hot Pot a chance as I'm usually very picky about where I go for it. The last time I wanted a new hot pot backfired as the place we had gone to (Mongolian hot pot) gave off a dirty ambiance and not so fresh meat. Even Morals Village was incomparable. Must be all hype.  Made in China turned out to be a lot better than I expected. Lunch menu (11-4PM  was as great as dinner, went for $17.99 and had everything we wanted.  Service was kind and friendly and the table came with an assortment of sauces for us to test out what we wanted to dip our meat and veggies in. Great hot pot spot and just a delicious as Kim Tao."}
{"text":"Breakfast is good. Slightly pricier than other places but arguably worth it for peace and quiet and larger portions and decent service.   We got a salted pork congee with black pepper (unique!) with a side of fried noodles, satay vermicelli with beef, and a western style meal (bacon/eggs/toast). All were quite good. The milk tea was also quite good! Not too milky with enough tea taste and not thin or watery.  Not much to add here. Everything was good."}
{"text":"MEDIOCRE.  Stopped in here earlier today for dinner with relatives. I must say that the overall experience was very underwhelming.  Pros: - The decor doesn't look half bad - The seating is spacious and it doesn't make you feel like you're stuck in a red-meat sauna with a ton of other people  Cons: - The ingredients came out with very POOR quality - the meats were hardly staying together and appeared oxidized / discoloured; the vegetables were yellowed and wilting - Service was very sparse and we had to repeat requests at least once, if not twice  I wouldn't be surprised if some of those meats were rejects/leftovers from Korean Grill House (literally next door).   I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to go for hotpot but there's some things I didn't like about this place as well.   For $18.95 per person, all you can eat and drink (pop, that is), that is a great price. They had a really good selection of meat, vegetables, dumplings, and some other stuff like tongue, liver and pig skin which I stayed away from. I would say the food was fresh and decent quality. They also have ice cream in three flavours (strawberry, chocolate, vanilla), mango pudding, and canned fruit and sago. I think dessert lost them lots of points with me. It felt like they just threw it on the menu so they can boast their menu has desserts, when it fact they make no effort for it to taste good.   The tables were somewhat small and hard to fit everything on the table. It didn't help that it was sticky which made me question the cleanliness of this place. They were also super close together so you are really close to your neighbours and their food. We went on a weekend so it was crowded and the noise level was loud. But despite how busy it was, the servers were fast and attentive. And we were so stuffed when we were done."}
{"text":"Now that hot pot season is approaching, it's time to go hunting for hot pot places again. Yes I know about Kim Tao and I've been there endless times, but I wanted to explore other hot pot places in the Richmond Hill/Markham area. I ended up here after walking around Commerce Gate looking at new restaurants that have popped up, as it is my least visited plaza along Highway 7.  We had the Angus Beef Seafood Hot Pot Buffet, since we believe the angus beef and seafood add-ons would be worth the $5 extra. Well...unfortunately, I didn't find the extra cost worth it. The angus beef slices were way too large, and once I fully cooked the beef it was way too tough for me to eat it due to the sheer size. The seafood platter included a lobster, which actually tasted very good for buffet style.  Some hot pot items we ordered include lamb, marbled beef, octopus, squid ball,  beef tripe, mushrooms, chicken sausage...and some others I forgot. I liked the lamb, marbled beef, beef tripe, and chicken sausage (and I'm not a chicken sausage person at all). Overall though nothing truly stood out throughout the meal, but nothing tasted terrible to the point I would give it 2 stars or below.  Their ice cream was very good for an AYCE place! Particularly their chocolate ice cream...yummy.  Kim Tao still overpowers this place by all counts, but that place is just insanely busy compared to here. Meh. There's probably a reason why. Service was a little better here compared to Kim Tao, but nothing to drive home about."}
{"text":"Maybe I should try hot pot here next time but we came here for lunch to eat some noodles and rice and not did I wish I went somewhere else  Food is over cooked and quantity is half what I usually get at other chinese places like congee queen,   I couldn't believe they charge extra for take out"}
{"text":"Came for an afternoon tea snack. I ordered the beef brisket with rice noodles, bf ordered the pickled veggies and pork with vermielli noodles. The beef brisket I had was moist with good flavor. But the rice noodles were a little hard, I think it could use another minute of cooking and it would of been fine. BF said his pickled veggies with pork was a little bland. Not really sure how anything pickled can be bland, but it was. They probably washed the picked veggies with water and diluted the taste of the veggies which is a shame.   Our meal came with a red bean and ice cream drink. The drink was pretty much standard, nothing special but tasted like it should.   Overall the noodles were a little smaller than what you would get at a noodles place like Keung's noodles. But if you eat it with a red bean drink it was perfect. The price is so cheap. It's like $4.25 for the meal and drink. I'd come back for other foods to have a more thorough review, but until then I'd recommend this place for afternoon snacks."}
{"text":"Good ventilation means that the smell of the food won't stick to your clothes, so that is a huge plus! Coming here for hot pot is always nice, it's close and convenient, the seating is comfortable and it comes with free Wi-Fi! Definitely come check this place out if you want to try hot pot! Did I forget to mention unlimited dessert?"}
{"text":"My fiance's family and I came here for our new year's eve dinner. The place was obviously understaffed and I felt terrible having to keep entering new orders (especially I really wanted more and more desserts!). Their selection was great and I really liked it over having a pile of frozen food at hotpot station and you go get it yourself. The boss/manager came to each table offering additional specials (fish head, salmon belly, pig blood? sausage?) for free. My fav was the GIANT oysters. Since no one else in our party is a huge fan of seafood, I had all 8 to myself! Aside from hotpot, there were small side dishes you can order. Unfortunately the servers have forgotten and we never bothered to check on our order. We were beyond stuffed from just the hotpot items alone. Their desserts were good (tapioca and mango pudding). Their ice cream were blah but I just like sweets.. so i still ate  a good 7 scoops -.-. My hotpot place to go to whenever we return to Toronto!"}
{"text":"Came here for their afternoon tea/lunch special. They seem to have a wide variety of foods from HK style breakfast to AYCE kbbq/hot pot. However, for their extensive menu, they definitely need to invest in more waiters. There were only 2 waiters in the entire store at lunch time. When we tried to call them because our food was finished and our drinks haven't arrived yet, they pretended not to see us and acted busy. Funny thing is, when we were about to pay for the bill and had money on the table, they ran and attended to us right away. So they are quick in collecting money but terrible in catering to other needs.   Anyways, for the food, we ordered a Maggi salmon rice dish (6.99) and all day breakfast Satay beef rice noodle with egg sandwich and lemon tea (7.99). Keep in mind, if you want soup/ drinks, everything is extra and not included in the already expensive price. I thought the all day breakfast was pricey for something so simple and the noodles came in a pretty tiny bowl. Egg sandwich was bland and flavourless. Salmon rice dish had only 4 pcs of fish, and small kimchi at the side. Nothing special for the pricey dish. However, I gotta give it that the place was modern, but I guess that's what you pay for and not the food itself. If you're looking for value, this is not the place to be. Would not recommend or come back for lunch. Maybe to try hot pot but was overall really disappointed."}
{"text":"I went to this place at lunch hoping for some hotpot but they did not have hotpot at lunch time (what?). I ended up having chinese dishes. I got the satay beef vermicelli with egg sandwich, one of their 'all day breakfast' deals and it came with a drink. It was decent. Nothing special, their prices are not too bad either, so it is definitely a viable option for a quick lunch with friends. Cept its location has the worst parking cause it's in Commerce Gate. It is right in between a bunch of other restaurants."}
{"text":"Review is for afternoon tea set only.  I'm always on the lookout for good deals for afternoon tea.. And this is definitely going to be one of my to go places!  Environment is quite modern and clean.. Cool birdcage like decor. This place is meant to be for AYCE hotpot but they also have regular Chinese dish lunch combos and afternoon tea sets.  You can get the Chinese style french toast WITH a drink for just $3.25! French toast was not bad, comparable to all other HK diners. Most places just offer the standard milk tea or coffee as the included drink. So what stands out to me here is their red bean or grass jelly ice cream drink at NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE YAY :)   My family members got the fish ball noodles and satay beef which is just $4. It's a good portion sized bowl for an afternoon snack and again, includes a drink.   i've been to quite a few asian places with afternoon tea.. And so far this seems to be the cheapest!"}
{"text":"Went to Made in China Hot Pot last week and I remember why I miss this place. We ordered the plum drink and ate to our heart's content. The 1 star is taken off for the small little sad plate of seafood which was considered to be an upgrade. Ignore the upgrade and stick with the usual stuff. If you are looking to have ayce classic hotpot, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Service is EXCELLENT & they always check on your table during your meal.  Great atmosphere, bright, clean, tidy, and a nice design.  Food is also good, selection is like the other hot pot places you would go to.  Reason why i would rate it 4 stars is because the beef is not top notch fatty beef like the other places. Usually beef is the most important plate at any hot pot place. However food is still great and very little oil.  Waiters were back and forth with the hotpot and korean grill house, im assuming it's the same owner.  Would definately come back.  $23.99 for seafood & beef hot pot - set price, you cant pick to only have beef hot pot for a lesser price.  $17.99 price is only for after 10PM-12AM  10% off for grand opening special, not sure of end date  Definately coming back, hope they have better beef the next time!"}
{"text":"Overall, I enjoy this place as a regular. Maybe it's because the only experience with AYCE hotpot is at Little Sheep on Warden BUT: 1. Servers at China Hotpot is attentive & they are always running around to place orders, refill drinks, or clear off your tables 2. There variety is acceptable  3. It's comfortable seating as they don't crowd the tables 4. They give you a complimentary seafood platter 5. They give you free drinks when customers would probably be willing to pay extra.  Downfalls: They only have one stall for the washrooms. Their parking lot is the smallest thing you'll ever see."}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 stars.   The good: I am reviewing the lunch box. I got the chicken which comes with rice, some spicy fried tofu, and turnip/bean sprouts as veggies. It also comes with soup and a drink for around $10, which is quite a good deal. I think the food is tasty and a great place to go for a quick and easy meal.   The bad: It is what you pay for. The meat comes a little charred and the soup is a bit salty.   All in all, I do enjoy coming to this place."}
{"text":"Closer to 4,75 stars. Tucked in a maze of restaurants...and you know what it's in a strip mall which very popular! We ordered their all you can eat hot pot. The good: They have specials take advantage of it. It reminds me of times when my family and I sat around and aye and talked. Before cell phones. The bad: if you don't like cooking or working for your food, this ain't  for you. The Ugly: yup in a strip mall it's always the parking. Tip: sometimes at all you can eat, your eyes are better bigger than your hunger. $$"}
{"text":"I love this place, not because of all the bird cage alike lamps hanging above each table, or their name has \"China\" in it, I just like hot pot. They happen to deliver what they present and satisfy your appetite.   I love their all you can eat hot pot including drinks with unlimited refills. The service is great, they would come by table often to take care of things such as adding water in the pot or ask if need more food/desert etc. They know what they are doing, you can tell there is a flow in service.   The food was great! All the materials were fresh and presented well. I loved their soup base, and get to make my own dipping. One thing is bring Pepto Bismol so you dont feel ill from over eating."}
{"text":"When it is cold and chilly outside, all I think about is having hot pot!  Hot Pot Angus Beef AYCE $17.99 a little pricey for a late night hot pot as there is no special pricing for after hour period.  Service was attentive and polite. The Angus Beef though a little leaner but of good quality. The other items were standard.  I like how now Made In China Hot Pot has more option than just having hot pots. I will be back for their lunch special and even for an early breakfast!"}
{"text":"I think it is a good thing that Made In China having a Hong Kong Style Cafe menu most of the business hour because if it is going to be solely on their hot pot menu, it would have went out of business for a long time....  Late Night Special ($13.99) though sounded like a decent price but not worth it at all. The food quality is just pathetic. And the satay soup based was just tasteless with zero satay taste. The thinly sliced beef has this funny looking colour and texture.. I even have my doubt if they were beef....  No I am not going to come back for Hot Pot.. ever... They might as well take the word Hot Pot out of their name.  The only reason it is not getting a 1 star because at least their none hot pot offering at the none hot pot hours are decent!"}
{"text":"Good place for afternoon tea and lunch special.  Wesley ordered one Hainan style chicken w rice, Brian ordered grilled pork chop w cheese rice, both look good. Feel so regret I didn't try their dishes because not familiar with each other. Mine is tomato egg beef rice. Too sweet for me maybe because too much  ketchup"}
{"text":"It's been quite some time now since I've last gone.  They've certainly improved. The meat quality has gone up, and the service is much more welcoming now.  I'm giving this a 4 out of 5 now!"}
{"text":"This place is not too bad for hot pot but not my first choice.  They do have a great selection of meats but I would like to see more vegetable selections.  Plus the price is a little steep for something that you have to cook yourself.  Just sayin!"}
{"text":"Came with a very large group and were easily accommodated by the spacious seating around here. Service was good, but that may be in part that we took up half the restaurant, and they probably wanted to leave a good impression.  Price wise this place is alright. I think it was around ~$20 each after tax (can't remember if it was before tip). Quality is meh, but it's AYCE, so I can't be too hopeful there anyway.  Unless you're getting the standard soup base, it costs a couple dollars extra to upgrade. I personally stuck to the standard, but even if I wanted another choice, I probably wouldn't get it, because why would I want to spend $5 on a soup base? Not worth it.  Would I return? Actually yeah, because my friends and I had a good time regardless of the food. Company is what matters here."}
{"text":"Yes I agree with Jen K, I do not at all like the Hot Pot here. No thanks!!!!  Their menu is so small (literally, a small hand-sized paper) with SO LITTLE items. For a seafood hot pot dinner, you'd need to add some $$ but it's days-old grocery store frozen seafood that tastes like it's been in the fridge and absorbed all the cold air.   The meats (most important item in a hot pot restaurant) were not good!! They are thick and chewy, and light pink / a bit coral in colour?? The tiny, non-flavourful fish balls were not so good either...    YUCKY  Decor is pretty strange for a hot pot place, it's (I guess) modern, cute and colourful? It's like a bubble tea place! I like that the pot is quite close to you -even for larger groups and larger tables.  They offer your hot pot in different kinds of soups AND they can do two soups in one pot (split in the middle). The soups aren't very flavourable (which is sometimes good so it doesn't cover up your food)  The dipping sauces were pretty decent. You DIY your dipping sauce with ingredients that come on a large tray (that gets passed around the entire restaurant...) -ex. green chili, satay, add egg... And the service (very young staff) is shockingly nice!   Unfortunately, I will not come back."}
