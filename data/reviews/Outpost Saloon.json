{"text":"The owner was there on the evening i went. I am going to agree with the guy above she was not a good person. She without a doubt costs her bartenders tips, and customers. Too bad she is oblivious to her customers needs and anyone else in her vicinity because she really wasn't a bad looking women. Oh well next time I'll go to Torrey pines pub."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to bar for football Sundays. Came today and they don't have the Sunday ticket for football. They also did not have food. The TV on the patio had volume issues and we could only get TBSHD in non-HD mode. We had to order from Angelina's for food which took well over an hour. Definitely went downhill from what this bar used to be. On a positive note, it was less smokey than usual."}
{"text":"I went here a few days ago with some friends looking to check out a new bar. The bar seemed alright at first, a little sketchy but nothing terrible. After a while we were told that they had beer pong so my friends and I jumped at the opportunity to do something besides sit and watch some mediocre karaoke. When we asked the bartender for the balls/cups he told us they were out and handed my friend $10 to go to the store to buy our own cups. Normally you would think doing a chore for a business would entitle you to a free or at least discounted pitcher... that was not the case here. We not only had to pay full price after doing work for the bar but it also took about 10 minutes to receive said pitcher. How this place is able to operate so terribly is far beyond my comprehension.  1/10 - would not go again."}
{"text":"The owner asked us to keep it down while playing beer pong. This bar sucks. The owner is disgusting, and doesn't want her bar run like a bar. She wants quiet hours, people. We asked her to come speak to us, and she \"didn't want to get involved.\" Don't buy a bar if you don't want people to have fun. Total buzzkill. Bye, Felicia. Go to Aces and Ales on Tenaya if you want to have a good time."}
{"text":"Never eaten here but close by my side of town karaoke Wednesdays, and Saturdays are great times my new spot to hang at."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff, and some of the best prices around.  I can also say with 100% certainty that the owners genuinely do care about their establishment and their customers and it shows.  Nice place, relatively quiet (unless is karaoke night!), and just around the corner.  Best neighborhood bar I've found in this neck of the woods."}
{"text":"I have never really had a problem with this place. Karaoke on Wednesdays and Saturdays and Happy Hour everyday. The place is spacious inside with a pool table, a dart board, and a machine golf game. 4 Stars because it's by the house :)  Done deal!"}
{"text":"Great place to go to on Sat night much love for Kat our karaoke kj its always a great time with her"}
{"text":"Nice little local bar. Good prices and decent selection of draft beer. Nothing fancy about this place. There's a pool table and a dart board. Lots of tv's and big comfy chairs. Not a bad place to have a couple of beers before heading to a movie across the street."}
{"text":"Quick stop at the Neighborhood bar. Cozy and good place to cool down from the Vegas heat, watch some baseball, hang out a bit while waiting for some people to finish shopping. Seems like a friendly group of people. $10 bucket or $2 bud and budlight. $1.50 o'doul's. Read in another review $.99 drafts, I'm there next time I'm around the area"}
{"text":"Good bar for locals!! Karaoke, friendly bartenders, decent prices/food, ping pong table...need I say more? Bring some close friends and it's a good time! Close to home so can't complain!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch the games!   With Santa Fe being a mad house my buddy and I went to this place to check it out because it was super close and we had been meaning to anyhow.  With football season in full gear I find this to be my new place to go, kick back, have a few beers and watch the games.  They have several TV's spread all around the bar with pretty much every game that is on.  If you're game is playing, but not on, just ask and they won't have a problem turning it on for you.    We arrive and the bar is pretty much dead with the exception of a few patrons here and there.  This is your typical sports bar environment though so If you don't appreciate the fine sound of a foul mouth and screaming guys that their buddies team sucks and the ref's are idiots, it's probably not a place you want to go to.    My buddy ordered a buck of Bud for like 10 bucks and I being Mr. Responsible for the day got a diet (she didn't charge for it, whoohoo!- yes it's the small things in life that count)  We were able to watch both our games as we are both separate teams and didn't have to stay at home watching direct TV arguing over hogging one team over the other; so it all worked out marvelously.    Didn't have any food, but I saw several other people grubbing, I'm sure it's typical bar food and when paired with alcohol you really cannot go wrong.  The staff was friendly and so were the patrons, just a little rowdy, but what do you expect- this is football were talking about here!   To get that final star, I probably would have liked to see them ask me if I wanted anything, not me having to go up and request it. Really not a big, deal as I will always come back, just letting yelpers know why I didn't go five."}
{"text":"I have been a couple of times for karaoke on saturday nights. The sound is great and the crowd is fun, the place is friendly, the DJ is awesome and you can't beat their $.99 cent house beer on tap! What more could you ask for on a saturday karaoke night with friends?"}
{"text":"awesome bar! been coming here off and on for almost 10 years. first name service from an awesome staff. if you are looking for great drink specials, loose machines, and a energetic happy environment than give this spot a chance. tell them kris sent ya!!"}
{"text":"This is my spot!  I love this bar.  It's my kind of place.  Just walkin through the front door puts a big smile on my face. :)  Okay, so it's close to home and cheap.  What more can you ask for?  Awesome bartenders who have your drink ready when you sit down?  Check.  Good food?  Check."}
{"text":"We went here to get some karaoke in our systems & genuinely had a place. This place is filled with locals, not really a tourist spot. My family was complaining that everyone sang really well at this place, but the approachability of the joint counterbalanced their fears of going up to the mic.   When I completely embarrassed myself, the karaoke jockey made sure that people clapped for me when they didn't, haha!  Their mugs of beer are ginormous. You will certainly feel like a pirate. Everyone is pretty nice and welcoming. They have standard bar food if you're starving.   It was genuinely a fun time, nice little venue!"}
{"text":"I just recently was 86 out of this bar. I've been going to this bar for at least 6 months enjoy the beer and the patrons. My overall experience was great, but management  substandard( Jolie)! I am 55 years old and then to bars all over the world funny this is the first time I've ever been 86th without knowing why Allah Ferguson Missouri! Where are the rights for the customer??? one thing I do know and I can control is my money!"}
{"text":"One of the best local bars in town. Great bar for any occasion. They have square bar with great bartenders that will have your drink ready before you sit down. If you become a regular you won't even have to order one cause as soon as you walk in its made. The food is pretty good and at a decent price. If you are into football this is the place to go. Great drink specials and card of the day specials for poker players"}
{"text":"a great local bar.  not a big chain.  All of the bartenders are friendly and drinks are heavy!  Karoake on Saturdays and Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Now here's the kinda place where the meaning of karaoke is stretched a bit. The setup is super bad just a tiny corner in the room where the \"regulars\" sit and the equipment is really trashy but yes in the sense of singing music on a screen it's karaoke. Secondly I see so often now in bars where these servers will cater to obviously intoxicated patrons there is something very wrong with those situations. Not only in the sense of the lawsuits they could face but how aggressive these people get with flirtation and their behaviour. I do like the pool tables and it's nice to see a dive bar with bathrooms that don't look like a slaughterhouse but there has to be a line with the cleanliness of the bar itself. I mean I know it's a dive bar I get it but feet sticking to the floor and a bar top that is wet and smells is a bit too much even for a dive standard."}
{"text":"If you want to sit and gamble alone, this is your bar. If you want to have a good time, go somewhere else. They said we were being too loud when we played beer pong that they set up. The owner said we were \"bothering (her) gamblers.\" It was a Friday night, and we were having fun! We were just playing beer pong and being excited about it. No fun allowed!"}
{"text":"This is a fun bar. Good menu selection from breakfast to dinner. During March madness they're having $5 chicken fingers, spring rolls (watch out for the spicy ranch...really spicy), personal pizzas and such. The food seems to be good quality and the bartenders Tim and Vic are very personable.  As a neighborhood bar you can't ask for a more friendly place with lots of drink specials and a well stocked bar."}
{"text":"Great price for drinks..but bartender is a total douche and needs to get fired."}
