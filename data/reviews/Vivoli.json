{"text":"Who is running this place? Wow it's gone downhill! Sad to see for such a great location on College. A big turn off is their dirty paper menu. This place used to have some class."}
{"text":"Nice friendly atmosphere, been there a couple of times. The patrons/friends know the staff on personal level this can cause problems if  you're trying to get there attention.   Entree are tasty and well plated, but not how we ordered it. The veal was well done, instead of med-rare, other than then I enjoyed the food and we will be back."}
{"text":"I felt a good service.  Italian Risotto that daily chef menu that was Chicken by White wine sauce.I knew the Southern Italian Risotto is very salty so I ordered do attention but it was still strong salt taste. Italia wine ''Negroamaro Nero''I liked. The wine has intense, garnet red color, with round flavor, slightly bitter and dry. I'd like to back ''Vivoli'' again."}
{"text":"Vivoli is a good choice for you if you're looking for authentic Italian pizza or calzone in a more refined atmosphere than your average pizzeria. Unlike in the States, the pizzas are not the huge, 12-slice standard. They are all individual-size pizzas and they range in price from $10-15. I had a Napoletano, and it was appropriately plain and purist: tomato sauce, mozzarella (not too much) and anchovies. Basta. I can say it was GREAT, no reservations. My dinner companion, a native Italian, had a calzone and it was a HUGE gorgeous baked-to-perfection sight to behold, with a beautiful presentation and decorative spices around the rim of the plate. He said it was the real deal. I also glimpsed a mean-looking fettucine with shrimp next to me and a nice filet of grilled salmon on the other side. A very good wine and beer list. The service was a tad slow, but very elegant and warm. I recommend Vivoli heartily as one of the best options in Toronto's Little Italy."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great food and the staff are friendly but my first choice for beer and my wife's first choice for wine was not available and I feel for the prices they charge the interior could do with some upgrading."}
{"text":"This place is based on a recommendation from a fellow food enthusiast who says this place is quite memorable, so we came by to sit in the patio since it was great weather.   Bonus marks for: Lots of young woman and its open late for night time snack!!!  We were greeted with a young, friendly server who brought our bread, I assume its some sort of baguette with some balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil. I was hungry, so I consumed most of the bread...=)  We started things off with their grilled calamari...The calamari tasted rubbery to me, and dry tasting. It was served on arugula tomato mixed with balsamic sauce. I would say that I've definitely had better calamari elsewhere, and would probably not order this dish again here...  2nd thing was the pizza...I forgot the name of the pizza, but the toppings had goat cheese, roasted red peppers and other veggies on it...The plus side for this pizza is the crust tasted alright, but kind of bland to me without sauce. I definitely envisioned that goat cheese would make pizza taste creamier but not for this one. I vouch for great tasting pizza at 'Pizzeria Libretto'!  Total bill was $28 after tax! Would anyone say that's standard or overpriced?  Would I come back? Yea, just to try some other stuff...The place has a nice atmosphere, all the young crowd goes there...Just some improvement on the food and its good to go!"}
{"text":"Visited last Friday with another couple for late night dinner. Seated quickly in upstairs patio.  I had pear& arugula salad and shared a margarita pizza with hubby. Salad was good but I found pizza was salty. Too bad because I was looking forward to stone oven baked pizza!  Not horrible but I've had better. Sangria was delish!  Huge glass and tasty!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for drinks and appetizers with a friend before we went dancing.  The service was quick and knowledgeable (our server suggested the calamari, which was perfectly seared and very tasty), and the patio was nicely busy.  I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"Love the vibe of the rooftop patio it is really nice in summer. Service is also always fast and nice. Food is delicious. And the sangria glasses are absolutely worth it!!! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on a Saturday night. They didn't offer the 4 Cheese Pizza anymore, and that's a pitty because that's the main reason I go there."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is good, location is good - so, no complaints! Particulaly loved the white wine sangria. Grilled calimary were very good too.  Will come again!"}
{"text":"I liked this place,  it had good pizza and a very nice patio. The patio along the street was noise with delievery trucks that parked right in front of where we were eating , but thats not the restaurants fault! The rooftop patio is nice, kinda cool to see College street on a rooftop! I wouldn't say there was anything wrong with this place, but I wouldn't say there was anything particularly special about it either. I enjoyed my lunch but nothing left me wanting to come back. The food options were typical to most of the italian food fair found on College.   Also the wait staff was very boring, no engagement or interaction with us at all. They we not busy, it just didn't seem like they cared we were there.   Overall. if your looking for a decent pizza you got it!"}
{"text":"Location is very central on the College/Little Italy strip.  I made reservations through Yelp and didn't have a problem when I arrived.  Love when I see that option on a resto's Yelp profile!   A table outside on the ground floor patio was ready for our party of five.  Our request for the rooftop patio wasn't possible because it was shut down due to it being too hot and the roof itself needed tending (?)  Regardless, the ground floor patio was fine and the weather was cooperating until we paid the bill.  I've been to Vivoli before but I remember the salads to be heartier and a bit larger in size and the pizzas to be less dry.  My children had the margherita pizza and they said it was ok and my pizza was more of a rustic type without tomato sauce or mozzarella and I found it to be on the dry side.  The pitcher of red sangria helped moisten the palate.  Overall, it was a decent meal and I am sure I will return but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is perfectly fine on the street and the inside is nicely done. However, I ordered chicken pesto linguine which was lackluster at best.   The chicken was dry, and was covered up by a completely overwhelming amount of pesto and oil. The linguine was drowning in the sauce which probably was to account for the poor quality of the chicken. The pasta itself was fine.   When brought up to the waitress she told me pesto is oily. Didn't really apologize and charged us anyway for the meal.   Poor and rude customer service to compliment a bad meal.   To be fair, the other three meals were fine from those I was with. That alone is the reason for two stars."}
{"text":"Went here last night with some of my SO's family that are visiting from Manilla. They wanted a Toronto experience so we went to Little Italy for some Italian.  There were seven of us, and we wanted to sit on the patio. The hostess was very friendly and accommodating, but the waitress acted like we were being a bother for asking for simple things. We ordered pasta dishes, and my SO's (late 60's) mother asked for cheese even though the waitress had come around earlier asking if anyone wanted Parmesan. The waitress snapped at her \"I was ALREADY out here with CHEESE and you said you didn't WANT any.\"  Similar comment when we asked for more water and didn't want to order more drinks.  She was, however honest that none of the pasta is freshly made in house, which is clear. For $15.95 I wouldn't mind having cheese brought to adorn my store bought pasta.   In the end she added a tip to the bill, for a party of 7 not 8 and terrible service. The entire time we were treated like it was a chore to explain items on the menu and bring us things like WATER. We were embarrassed for bringing our guests here and my SO's elderly mother was upset.   Not worth it. There are nicer restaurants in the 'hood that don't treat you like garbage.  BLACKLISTED."}
{"text":"Food was great, service great (other than one appetizer mistake and 10 minute repair.)  The only thing that bothered me wad that the guy who seated us was the same guy going back to a table who were drunkenly shouting vulgar topics.  I guess I wouldln't have cared had it not been my anniversary, where I was looking for something a little more intimate.  However, as said the food was exactly what I expected: good italian food. I got the gnocchi with rose sauce ans my boyfriend got the penne arrabiata.. great flavour! The bruscetta wasn' t anything special..  Il fornello' s is better."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time (sit in, take-out, and delivery). The food is so delicious. I order the penne arrabiata or a margherita pizza and they are both very, very good. The house salad and the arugula salad are both top notch. The salad dressings are so good, especially the house salad port fig vinaigrette we went out and tried to recreate it so we could eat it at home more often! One of the bests parts about sitting in the restaurant is being able to order the absolutely amazing sangria! The service is always great every time I've come here! I will definitely continue to come back here!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, food is average quality. Very nice patio and in a nice area. (if you like busy city life)   However, I did feel that the service was very slow. There was a moment where we honestly thought the waitress forgot about us."}
{"text":"i'll keep this brief:  italian food should let the ingredients speak for themself. dont hand me overly salted plates of carbs and then automatically add the tip on my bill. both leave horrible tastes in my mouth  one visit was enough"}
{"text":"What a hidden treasure.  Was looking for a place to have lunch with a friend on Valentines day. Most places in Little Italy were not open. We walked in and they said today it was 25% off, on Valentines day?  So we stayed.  Food was wonderful, waitress was so nice and knew when and when not to show up.    The guy making the pizzas looked like he was really enjoying making them.   I didn't get a pizza, but will next time, and there will be a next time. They could do without the big screen TV, it's not a sports bar."}
{"text":"It may not be the nicest looking restaurant on the block, but if you are looking for huge portion sizes and killer sangria then this is the place for you. The antipasto fiera platter is a meal in itself, and even with a belly full of antipasto it's hard to resist the delicious pasta and wood fired pizza, both of which can be made gluten free. They are currently closed for renovations, (which will hopefully update the outdated decor) but I eagerly await it's return."}
{"text":"Great services & lovely location. Bathrooms are down a very small, narrow & steep stairs. Food was good. Antipasto plate needed more vegetables to go with the cheese & meat. Beverage selection is plentiful. The female servers have accents, not necessarily Italian & are unusually beautiful.  Seems like mgmt did this on purpose. There were no make servers. The food was good, but menu was limited. The squid in the Pasta di Vivoli was a bit rubbery but overall good. I would probably not go back because of all the other similar options. Except this restaurant is one of the few serving Italian that is open for lunch. All other don't open until 4 or 5pm."}
{"text":"Situé dans le Little Italy, le Vivoli est l'endroit chic et romantique par excellence pour aller déguster une pizza au feu de bois. L'attente pour une table peut être assez longue certains soirs mais elle vaut le coup. Il y a également un patio que l'on peut réserver, très pratique si vous venez en groupe.  Located in the heart of Little Italy, Vivoli is THE chic and romantic place to go for a traditionnal pizza. The waiting line can be a little bit long but it's totally worth it. There is also a patio that you can book, very useful if you come with a large group."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, service is not that great. Staff does not greet you once you enter."}
{"text":"Have been a few times, food and service is always consistent. Prices are average. Make a reservation during nights, weekends. It can get busy. Great patio, lots of space to sit outside."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and the service was pretty much garbage, to the point that we had to charge the credit card on the machine ourselves.  The crowd was primarily smokers outside, so that also ruined the evening.  To top it off, the pizza, and the calamari we ordered was not the best.  As previous reviewers have noted...food is definitely a lot more salty (old?)  Not planning to come here again...it was like hooters but food equivalent to packaged Italian microwave dish."}
{"text":"Today I went to Vivoli for lunch with two co-workers in honor of our mutual April birthdays. The reason that I chose Vivoli is that I had recently found a deal via Fabfind (spend $25 for $55), and because the restaurant is only a 5 min walk from work.   We arrived at 1230, and to my surprise, the entire restaurant was empty, save for one server and one pizza chef. In general, when a restaurant is totally empty during the middle of lunch hour, my expectation is that it is not a good sign. That being said, we had already committed to lunch there via the coupon, so I put my game face on.  We were met fairly promptly by the waitress and were seated by the window. We were asked if we wanted to sit outside, but as the temp was still hovering in the low teens, we opted to sit indoors.   The waitress seemed a little bit unprepared as I had asked her what the soup of the day was, and she didn't know. She returned and quickly listed off the specials, and then asked us if we wanted something to drink. (On the whole, there were no complaints from the level of service). However, I did have to ask for pepper to be added to my soup. Normally, in a restaurant of this calibre, I would expect this to be offered by the waitress.   I must say that I'm surprised by some of the other comments (read Ritchie C and Attila T). I tried a slice of my co-worker'spizza (it had prosciutto and mozerella) and I did not find it to be a disappointment. It seemed quite fine. So, if I were you, I'd take their comments with a grain of salt.  I ordered the veal panini (it came with mozerella, pomadoro, and mushrooms), and the soup of the day (which was chicken noodle soup). On the whole the panini was ok. Not bad. Not outstanding. Just ok. I'd probably give a rating of 3 out of 5 on this alone. The soup was served quite hot and was in a medium sized bowl.   For dessert we went for the chocolate cake, which was absolutely superb. The cake alone moved my rating up from three to four stars.  As far as atmosphere is concerned, there isn't much to write about. I did like having the window view of College St. and I liked looking at the huge wood fired oven.   As far as noise level is concerned, it was quite quiet, though that was more of a factor of there only being a few other tables occupied while we were eating. A better assessment would be during a typical Friday or Saturday night.  As far as price is concerned, as a result of the coupon, we ended up paying $30 for 3 people (tax & tip incl.). Without the coupon, it would have been closer to $65, which for lunch in my opinion is a bit too expensive. They do have a deal, whereby if you order a pizza for lunch, they will give a 25% discount. However because we had already brought in the coupon, the 25% discount would not apply.  Would I return? With a coupon? Definitely. Without a coupon? Perhaps. However there are too many other places to try beforehand, so I likely won't be back so soon."}
{"text":"I thought I was going to hate this place because the hostess who greeted us seemed annoyed that we even entered the place.  Then she sat us at the worst possible table, at the back by the staircase leading upstairs which would have people bumping into us the whole night. So we asked to be moved to another table, one she should have sat us at to begin with, and even that seemed to annoy her.  There is nothing I hate more than bad service and this place started off horribly.  The server that came over saved this place from our yelp wrath and was naturally very pleasant and helpful.  We started with the Alla Roberto pizza, which is cooked prosciutto, mushrooms, sauce and cheese.  We came here for the pizza after hearing how amazing it was, while good it is not the greatest I've had.  A bit more sauce would push it into really good category as the crust, and other toppings are delish.  For our mains I had the agnolotti stuffed with butternut squash in a rose sauce which was unreal. I usually never get pasta out because I always find it underwhelming and the sauce to be bland.  But this was full of flavour and cooked perfect.  The chica had fettucinne with meat sauce which she loved as usual, portion was huge and sauce was sweet.  The place has a great vibe, big vibrant patio and overall nice ambience.  Food is high quality and our server was excellent.  Just kick the hostess we had to the curb as she doesn't belong in such a good establishment."}
{"text":"Love this place !!! The sangrias are amazing !!! I can never decide which one of the wood oven pizzas i want !!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful Italian food  service was really great, everyone is very friendly and helpful. They unfortunately didn't have the wine or beer my husband and I requested but, recommended some great choices. My husband had the grilled chicken pizza with goats cheese and I had the shrimp fettuccine Alfredo - absolutely amazing! Such a warm atmosphere, would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Vivoli is one of these places that doesn't really stand out either way - but this is a problem on a street like College where you are competing with some solid restaurants.  Service was particularly slow on the Saturday night I went there on a date. We ordered 2 beers and 2 dishes and we were there for almost 2 hours. The very few times a server came by it was a different person.  We weren't in a particular rush so we didn't mind too much, but I can see how that would be problematic.  I've eaten at Vivoli's many times over the years and have always felt ok about it, never super overwhelmed with enthusiasm."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  I was all excited to sit on outside on their beautiful rooftop patio to enjoy the redonkulous summer heat with a beer and some pizza and I left there utterly disappointed to how bad the food was.  To start, the bruschetta was served to us on soggy whole what bread, not toasted, not buttered - nada.  It tasted like a wet sponge which could have been salvaged had they prepped the toppings properly, but no, it was a pile of diced tomatoes with zero garlic or onion flavour - not even salt!  The cheese they put on top was also sad and tasteless.  C'mon now! I thought we were in Little Italy?!  Where's the damn pride?!  We ordered two pizzas, the Alla Marco and the Salmon.  The salmon was definitely better than the Marco, but neither were very flavourful.  The goat cheese on the Marco was sparse, the chicken rubbery and it just felt like flat bread with things dumped on top.  While the waitress was very friendly, she was incredibly slow and double charged us for a couple things on our bill.  I was holding out going here 'cuz I thought it was worthy of a meaningful meal, but I'm glad I did just a pop in, 'cuz there's no way I'm going back."}
{"text":"Went here on a double date during the week.  Even though it was fairly quiet the server was hard to pin down.  We waited quite a long time before the drinks order was taken and even longer for her to come back to take the meal orders.  Peronis are $6.50 and they have a decent selection of wines.  We ordered the waving flag pizza which wasn't all that great to be honest.  Also got the tilapia and although it tasted good the serving size was on the small side.  I've been to many Italian restaurants and while there was nothing 'wrong' with Vivoli, there are better places for genuine Italian food."}
{"text":"My favourite Manicotti in the whole city!! I love coming here, it's been my #1 option in Little Italy for years"}
{"text":"I have hearted this place before I even step foot in it. I always just awesome it was too fancy of a place for me. This last week I've been there twice and it is worth it. The rooftop patio... leaves me speechless and with this weather it can't get any better.   The servers are a little cocky, but I just treat them like the custom officers and then they always seem to bring down their noses."}
{"text":"I really love this place in the summer.. such a great patio and amazing food. The waitress was very nice and recommended great dishes. We had pizza and pasta and both were phenomenal."}
{"text":"Overall good food and a great vibe. Drinks on the rooftop patio is always a good time."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday party. the hostess when asked about our reservation just told us to go inside rather than show us where our table was. This was especially awkward as we didn't know the other party guests we were meeting, because our friend whose birthday it was hadn't arrived yet.   we ordered our drinks and the waitress seemed nice at first but very cut and dry and seemed only cheerful when talking to us about her sunburn and how she planned to vacation to Honduras.   from then on the service was down hill, my girlfriend had to wait 15 minutes to get a coffee, and then we had to wait another 15 minutes before we could order food and we had to ask to order food.   the music was horrible cheesy euro house music that was BLARING and we had to yell to talk to our friends beside us. WHEN WE WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT! haha ridiculous! we asked to have the music turned down, only to have them crank it back up 20 minutes later.   ordered pasta and it was \"okay\" but obviously made from store bough dry pasta, that you can get at Metro next door. i know this from the giant messy pile of pasta boxes literally stacked to the ceiling next to my head where i sat!   we read the pizza was \"good\" so we ordered their signature \" waving flag pizza\" only to get entirely plain sauceless dough that had been in the oven and raw toppings put on after wards. no melted cheese almost zero olive oil. no love put into this pizza whatsoever.  the bruschetta my friends ordered was a joke served on the same overly thin sliced tasteless bread that they toss at you for free when you sit down.    waitress was basically never there to check on us unless we told another server to go get her.   we had to ask 3 times to be brought sparkling water, no parmesean cheese was offered and there was almost zero pepper coming out.   was brought our bill with the tip already added at about 13%. i don't think i would have tipped more than 5% had i been given the option.   and given the option, i would also never return!   laughable fake italian restaurants like this don't belong in toronto when there's better places in abundance all around us."}
{"text":"Used to go here years ago for good Italian when I noticed the now defunct The Standard was going downhill. Seems Vivoli is also on the way out.   Service was actually quite good. She checked in multiple times but was not intrusive. However, the same cannot be said for the food. We ordered an antipasto platter that had some meats (hot salami, prosciutto), few cheeses (Asiago, Parmesan, and Gouda), bruschetta, the pesto linguine, primavera, and penne a'lla vodka.   The platter was disappointing, the bruschetta was atrocious - could hardly call it bruschetta. I've had better at Milestones. The pesto linguine was disgusting. Incredibly oily - it was as if you were slurping oil. Could taste nothing else. Primavera had carrots in it which is odd. Penne a'lla vodka was fine!   Years ago, Vivoli was quite good and I am sad that has fallen off so hard. Little Italy itself is nothing like it used to be."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday dinner with my family here. We found a great deal online and decided to try it out.  Their Sangria is delicious. Must try! The food was very good as well. Will definitely return. Great food, great service and lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been here with groups of people for drinks - wonderful place, great atmosphere and servers!  Can't comment on the food as I haven't sampled it yet, but the cocktails and service are fab."}
{"text":"Vivoli is right in the heart of Toronto's Little Italy and is always a hotspot! It is especially popular during the summer with its huge patio with plenty of wine and food flowing around for all to enjoy.  I was able to reserve a table for a group dinner at Vivoli last spring and was happy with the service and the warm atmosphere.   The food was absolutely delicious and flavourful, however, I can agree with the previous person who reviewed this restaurant about some of the portions being a bit small.    So if you have an appetite for good Italian food but you want a larger portion, you will need to order more food options or come with a less hearty appetite to begin with.  And in addition, I would recommend this place as a date location to grab a glass of wine or a light dinner with your special person. My boyfriend and I enjoyed a wonderful night last summer on Vivoli's patio, taking back some white wine and enjoying the candlelight.  Overall, this restaurant is very nice, both for its lovely interior and its romantic feeling."}
{"text":"I haven't had Italian for quite some time so I was definitely looking forward to this one. Not so much about the restaurant but more of the food as I have never even heard of this place. Nonetheless the crowd looked lively and it lured us in.  Let's get right to it. This stuff is unimaginative, uninspiring and worth of a great big yawn! Nothing we ate here was worthy of a mention other than that it's bland and bland. Pasta was overcooked and flavours are lacking. The lasagna was a watery mess with very little meat and cheese; nothing more than a few pasta sheets swimming in a light tomato broth. You will be hard pressed to find even any herbs or seasoning in your dish (just look at the pics from other Yelpers!).  There's nothing savoury or hearty about this food. There's no soul to the dishes and this is NOT how Italian food should be."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last weekend with the girlfriend. Had the grilled squid and also arugula salad to start, squid was great, salad was over priced. For pasta I had a shrimp linguine and my girlfriend had creamy chicken pesto linguine. Overall dinner came up to $90 with a bottle of Pinot. Loved the squid, enjoyed the side salad that came with the squid more than the arugula salad. The pasta was over cooked, flavor was good. The pesto was way too heavy on the cream. The upper deck was nice, lovely setting. Overall enjoyed my dinner but the pasta could use some finessing!"}
{"text":"Service was good, cant really complain about anything.  However the main problem of this place is the food.  The pizza was garbage. It was tastless, and the flavours didn't really go well together. Also a couple of the olives had seeds in them (really? it takes one second to take the seed out when putting it on the pizza).  Pasta dish was alright as well. Came out nice and hot, but still lacking in body (no flavour).  I noticed too allot of the veg items seem to be from cans and have a sort of off sour taste to them. wtf?  Also to the management, get your cooks some whites. The least you can do is make them look professional especially when they are in a some what open kitchen.  So in the end, i'd come here for drinks and sit out on the patio (which was crammed with seats btw), but skip out on the food."}
{"text":"We were wandering around little italy for the first time today .. and wandered into vivoli by accident. Food? B+ Price? B+ Ambiance? it was around 2:45PM so it was nearly empty ... Service? D  It was actually the cook/chef who seated us ... the waitress was dicking around and didn't show up until we were ready to order. The cook was super nice, but the waitress definitely needs an attitude adjustment. She was strutting around with her cans hanging out, which is totally fine, but please just don't have such an attitude! I skimmed over the previous reviews ... which seem to have comments about the poor, poor service and i can't say that i disagree!  She didn't come to take our order until maybe, 20 minutes later? During this time, she was serving other patrons who came in AFTER us ... which is also fine since they might've been regulars/friends. but then, her friends also showed up ... and her boyfriend too and then she sits there and just socializes ...   Service was curt and rude. Let the beer sit on the bar for 10 minutes before bringing it to us. Brought the bread over way after we ordered ... at the same time with the main course actually.   I had the baked manacotti .... very yummy. Super hot when it came out. Delicious! The pizza was ok ... it was thin crust like how i like it. Also loved the bread in the beginning too!  Lunch orders are 25% off ... in which she did not give us. The owner (??) noticed us looking over the bill and was perceptive enough to do something (thank you).   I will also include that I left a 2 dollar tip on a 30-dollar order and that was being SUPER gracious."}
{"text":"This place has been a favourite of mine for years.  Very consistent good and service.   Also, probably one of the best places for wood oven pizza in Toronto."}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant I tried today during my first day in Toronto. My friend and I ordered the Penne All'arrabbiata and the Calabres pizza since we both couldn't decide on just one thing. Both were good! The pizza had little pieces of spicy sausage and was a bit on the greasy side but we were too hungry to care. The pasta was good as well. The service was pretty fast considering only one person was waiting 4 other tables and the bar area. I forgot her name. She was very nice and gave my friend and I free shots because we're both celebrating our birthdays out here. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service ! Waitres/ waitress seemed very moody, glasses and plates were dirty twice"}
{"text":"First time at the Vivoli with the family. Enjoyed a nice dinner with Pizza, Pasta, Salads and Wine. The food was great on time and aimed to please. This is a great place for a simple lunch or dinner with both Rooftop and street patio.  My Family and I enjoyed our visit and will most definitely make another trip back some times soon."}
{"text":"Came here with the boyfriend. We were here on a Wednesday evening and it was basically empty, except for one other couple. The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice. The bread that they brought out at the start was dry and hard to chew, so we were disappointed and regretted our decision to try the place. For appetizers, we got the caprese salad and a caesar salad. Both of which were good, making up for the bread. Our mains were the margherita pizza and the primavera pasta. My boyfriend commented on how he preferred this pizza to Goodfella's, which is a big thing for him. And for dessert, we got tiramisu and chocolate cake, both of which I loved.   I doubt we'll be coming back, only because we prefer to try somewhere new every time we go out. But overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I ordered the Ravioli. The portion was terribly small but delicious. Although I had to finish half of my friends steak because I was still hungry."}
{"text":"Mixed emotions about this place.  I visited tonight for the first time and had a weird time.  I ordered a caesar salad, which came sans croutons.  Sent back for a repair job.  The music was great, but unnecessarily loud.  I couldn't finish my meal so I asked for the rest to go, and in a bag.  Along it came in an aluminum container...sans bag. Minor things, I admit, but they do add up.  Having said that, the pizza (the Piquante) was really quite something.  Lots of cheese and garlic.  Very tasty.  My server was very attentive without being overly-so, and genuinely very friendly.    If I could rate this place on food alone, I'd give 5 stars.  But overall, I'd have to say the experience left me underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I had supper this evening at Vivoli.   I've walked by it lots of times but have never stopped in.  It was such a nice day and I sat on the patio.  Katerina, my server, brought me some bread along with olive oil and balsamic vinegar to start.  Pizza are made in a wood burning oven and take about a minute.  I ordered a Bambini pizza.  It was a good pizza!  The dough was soft and puffy and chewy ... just how I like it.  The sauce was tasty and there was lots of pepperoni.  I'd get it again.  Katerina was friendly.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Super quick. Super hip. Super friendly. Super delish!! This place is awesome for a bite to eat before a concert at the MOD club or to go for drinks after work. The pizzas are soo good, they're made in a wood burning oven and they're thin and the crust is fluffy! The servers are polite and really attentive. My table tried the Romeo and Juliet dish , all the salads and the veal. All good. I can't wait to use the patio."}
{"text":"Went on a date. Seating was good. Waiter service was okay, didnt ask me if I wanted for drinks. I had the risotto which was okay, date had smoked salmon pasta which was excellent. Place was very lively but decor was all over the place. Overall good"}
{"text":"Mozzarella pizza was great but the mushroom Crustini was, with no exaggeration a small thick piece of of baguette. Three mini mushroom caps in a tooth pick and one tiny plain shrimp on top. This is a $10 appetizer, It's insane that they even offer this as an option. We sent it back and still got charged for it."}
{"text":"Used to come here 5 years ago. Went back a few times over the past six months to really give it a chance and have now decided that  this place really jumped the shark.   You can taste the poorer quality of the food and lament the stingy amounts of basil in dishes based on the ubiquitous herb. The food is now made by cooks, not chefs and the service is impersonal and detached. There used to be a great mix of staff with winning personalities, now it's just blonde girls who visibly hate their jobs and expect tips just because they iron  their hair.   Vivoli looks like it's on track to close its doors and it may just be time to pull the plug."}
{"text":"I visited with my in-laws and a couple friends last week for dinner. We had made reservations online but I guess the restaurant actually doesn't have access to Yelp reservations; for whatever reason, they hadn't received it. It was busy but they still managed to seat us all. The restaurant itself is a mix between modern Italian and hipster trendy. The lower level opens up onto the street, so it's noisy, but that's part of the charm. They have a wood burning pizza oven and a super cute rooftop patio. I ordered the margherita pizza, and it was So. Good. Definitely recommend it to anyone; it's typical Italian but they do it so well!  I only gave four out of five because of two things: the table, menus, and cutlery were dirty, and the service was verrrry slow. I'm not usually high maintenance about service, but I had a work commitment after dinner and had to wait over twenty minutes after I finished for the bill. Personally, that didn't really affect my experience much, but it is something to mention. I will definitely come again & overall loved the whole place. Super cute!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant!Enjoy ourselves!Next time visit Toronto I think it's the first place I should visit"}
{"text":"Walked along college and the upper level of Vivoli caught my eye, so we decided to have dinner there. Upstairs was more of a lounge feel, kinda like a sports bar vibe. We ordered the lasagna and also the shrimp fettuccine. The wait time to get our pasta dishes were quite a wait, while the people beside us who arrived later and ordered pizzas got their food much faster. The lasagna was tasty, the shrimp fettuccine - not so much. Really bland. Service was okay. Complimentary bread didn't taste fresh."}
{"text":"This is not good Italian food. It's almost laughable that this restaurant has been around for a while in Little Italy and isn't even good. We ordered the bruschetta, which I kid you not, was toasted baguette with tomatoes on top. Riveting. Then I ordered the rose sauce gnocchi. The sauce was so average it honestly tasted canned like a Chef Boyardee sauce. I definitely wouldn't come back here. Not surprising we were able to get a seat without a reservation on a Saturday night. Also someone was there celebrating their birthday, how sad to have your birthday meal at this tragic place."}
{"text":"A very lively restobar. The Ferno pizza was good, but I've had better. Hence, the 3.5 stars. I probably shouldn't write Yelp reviews on enuberated nights, but truth be told this is a very good place to have dinner when you're in Lil Italy. I'll most likely come back and try other pizzas. Service is not amazing, but alright. We waited a long time to get our bill despite telling our waitress and a bunch of other waiters. Other than that, the place is a hip hangout spot."}
{"text":"The food is great but I don't think I've ever experienced worse service."}
{"text":"Sometimes my reviews end up being long, so let's see what happens when I try to get to my main points.  good: -service; -looking waitresses and waiters of both genders (is that a requirement of theirs, to get hired?); -minestrone soup *** TRY THIS ***; -flat pizza *** another item to try, although share it w/ a friend if pos.  I barely ate half my pizza*** (I tried their cheeseless Marinara pizza); -a co-worker recommended their phenomenal $10 Sangria, fyi.  okay: -pasta and fagioli/beans soup (although careful if your stomach is sensitive);  oh noes: -eggplant parmigiana (too oily, and much too salty); -gnocchi (aftertaste, wasn't to my taste.  :(   ).  ~~~ Yay, you can finish this meal off with a nearby gelato at either Dolce (keep walking west on College St.) or The Mad Italian (keep walking east on Colleget St.).  Both gelato ice cream places, are on the north side of College - like Vivoli is.  ~ Would I go again?  I'd go for their minestrone soup again, for sure. It's one of my fave versions of minestrone soup.  Not even tomato based, and soooo tasty.  Ask for freshly ground pepper, and some olive oil to drizzle into your soup, if you like."}
{"text":"We came to Toronto to a concert at the Virgin Mobile Mod Club, after researching parking & restaurants near the club Vivoli was on my short list of possible places. We did not want something very expensive and were aiming for some type of pizza/sandwich. Loved the Margherita pizza and enjoyed the bread they brought. The size was perfect for two people to share and the pizza was delicious, wonderful thin crust that was the perfect combination of crispy on the edges and chewy in the center..great amount of basil and the perfect amount of cheese."}
{"text":"Location: College St West, Toronto,  Item Ordered: Glass of Signature White Wine Sangria ($10)  After having less than mediocre sangria earlier at Nirvana, I was badly needing to satisfy my craving for a quality glass of fruity wine, on this particular summery Sunday that I dedicated to drinking sangria, people watching and not much else. I found my fix here at Vivoli. A 16 ouncer which is more than plenty, done just right. A lovely fusion of fresh summer fruits, we're talking peaches, oranges, strawberries and blueberries.   Although, I didn't eat, the food smells and presentation was inviting. I must come back for a proper dinner.   Odd/funny fact: Vivoli's online menu claims a glass is 16 ounces yet their in-restaurant menu reads 20 ounces for $10. Let's just say the glass is in fact 20 ounces to prove my point, if that is the case, it really doesn't make any sense to get a 60 ounce pitcher for $35. You do the math:)"}
{"text":"Little Italy - makes for a great summer patio.  The antipasto was great and the drink options are fantastic.  The pasta was memorable as was the patio.  It's a nice local place and gets busy quickly."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with a friend and we sat on rooftop patio. Great view outside, and Jays game was playing on the screens. Casual place. We got complimentary bread pieces with balsamic dip on the side before we got our main food. I ordered lasagna and my friend ordered grilled calamari which also came with a side of greens. No complaints about service, but the food was delicious!!!"}
