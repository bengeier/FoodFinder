{"text":"Turkey and salmon burgers are delicious - and yummy sweet potato fries. Great atmosphere and there's live music on Saturday nights. It's our go-to pub!"}
{"text":"Stopped in the Black Dog for a couple of pints. On a busy night, very fast and friendly service. Manager was making his rounds around the pub greeting people and making aure everything was in order. Very clean and organized pub.

Definately will be back and look forward to trying some of the pub fare for lunch or dinner soon."}
{"text":"Had the po boy. All I can say is yummmm!
Service was great!"}
{"text":"The Black Dog is more than a restaurant-it is an institution. I have been coming to this place since I was 19 and I loved it from when I walked in... And was promptly told to remove my hat. Being 19 at the time and not wanting to drink where ill-mannered young people (my peers at the time) were this was perfect. I gladly removed my hat and sat down and have been periodically visiting ever since. 

They still have great live music and friendly staff and the food is still good. This is not a fine dining establishment and that is just fine. I have never had something I disliked even if I have had better elsewhere. That is a good sign because they don't just focus on a few signature dishes but do everything well. 

It is also worth trying their local brews. They are wonderful and the price is good. 

At the very least come and give it a try and just take in how happy everyone around you is."}
{"text":"I never thought that I would have trouble polishing off a plate of nachos. These were soggy. The ambiance, decor, service and bruschetta my buddy ordered and beer were all fine and I really like the place. Next time I won't order the nachos though."}
{"text":"We landed here to celebrate our anniversary with friends... wattta mistake!!!!! We had been here couple of times and loved the food and ppl... but.. last two times.. we were not treated well... the waitress today was really rude and did not oblige to to even recite the beer on tap.... the food order was taken in a huge hurry although the restaurant was merely empty but arrived around 40 mins late... once the food arrived we were not offered fresh parmesan or ground pepper which was customary before.... all in all we felt that it wasn't our most pleasant experience...."}
{"text":"My favourite neighbourhood place to eat. Their steak, shrimp, and mashed potatoes are to die for. Great patio on the roof as well."}
{"text":"Went here for my mom's birthday. We had a great time, the menu is quite large with a large selection of daily specials. We had the coconut shrimp, which was fabulous, the shrimp were huge and the thai sauce that came with it was spicy and sweet - absolutely great. I had the pasta that was similar to a ravoili I cannot remember the specific name for it but it was great, the garlic cream sauce was perfect and left me just stuffed enough. 
My mom had the ahi pasta (a special of the daily) and my grandmother had the chipotle stuffed chicken which was served with mashed potatoes and veggies (which she made a note to comment were cooked perfectly) 
My boyfriend had the ENORMOUS sunday prime rib special. This thing was a monster and he ate every bite. Everybody thoroughly enjoyed their meals and were left delightfully full. If that weren`t enough we decided to be fat and order dessert and coffee. We had the caramel crunch cake which was surprisingly light and airy, layers of meriange (spelling) and some sort of cookie crumble. Coffee and after dinner drinks were standard. After all that food the bill came to $173 taxes in. 
Our server was fantastic explaining the menu and giving us plenty of time while we waited for my boyfriend to join us, so we gave her the full 15% she deserved.
For the portions of food and the high quality this is an excellent choice for any special occassion. As we live around the corner I know it gets packed around dinner and lunch so get there early. We went around 5 on a Sunday and it started to fill up quick. Overall a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"This is a difficult review to write because there is much to like here, and much of what I don't like may not be the pub's fault.  First, the servers are welcoming and attentive--no issues there.  The beer selection is very good--no issues there.  Food wise, this is a very difficult place for me to eat as I am a vegan and hubby is a vegetarian.  I realize it's a pub and they cater to a pub crowd, but would it kill them to have a few healthier options?  These days who doesn't have a veggie burger on the menu--The Black Dog that's who.  Even food aside, my biggest issue with this pub is the local crowd that gathers every night at the bar.  The more they drink the louder and more obnoxious they become.  The language used at the bar is atrocious.  I've even been witness to this going on at 8pm when families and children are in abundance.  I'm not a prude by any means, but when every other word is a curse and the volume is such that I can't have a normal conversation with my husband, there is an issue.  There are some nights we would like to come for a few beers and hang out for awhile, but cannot tolerate the nonsense of the regulars.  I wish management would step in at some point and cool these guys off."}
{"text":"I took a buddy of mine who's visiting, for a drink last night. We were seated in the bar area and was promptly served our drinks and an order of delicious calamari. Very nice atmosphere, good food and great service."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night with a group of 9 friends. It was quite busy, but we were able to be seated without a reservation after about a 5 minute wait. 

There were 2 menus given to us once we were seating. They have a regular menu and one for daily specials. Lots of variety to choose from all at very reasonable prices. I had a hard time choosing what I wanted to eat. 

I ended up ordering shephards pie, with a caesar salad. I was surprised at how generous the portion sizes were! The pie was slightly salty, but still very good. My bf ordered the porkchop which came with a side of sundried tomatoe mashed potatoes. I love mashed potatoes and the ones he had were just outta this world. So good. 

We were there celebrating a birthday and after we ordered dessert, the waitress gave us the dessert on the house. Amazing customer service. 

When it came for our bills (we asked for separate), some orders ended up on the wrong bill. We ended up working it out amongst the group. Thankfully I had cash, otherwise I would have been slightly annoyed. 

Overall I'm definitely coming back to the Black Dog. They serve brunch as well and I'd love to see what they offer."}
{"text":"I would like to comment on the service at this pub. The waitress we had was extremely rude and made our dining experience very uncomfortable.

Also, the environment of the restaurant was not welcoming at all. Throughout our whole meal until we left, customers gave stares as if they had not seen people from out of town which made our group feel uneasy. This may not have to do with the restaurant but as a customer I rather not spend money at a restaurant where the staff and customers are rude and judgemental."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in the mature Port Union and Kingston Area. Been there a second time within one week. Enjoyed the environment and the food both times. Unfortunately I can't say the same about service as we ran into a very rude waitress the second time around...must have been my tie ;)."}
{"text":"We booked the private room for our work party.

We knew we were in for something good when we arrived; it was packed and lively. The room was festively decorated and spacious; far too large for our crowd, it could easily host 30 people. We were taken care of my 1 wonderful server and given the regular menu and the specials and they both looked delicious. 

We started with appetizers...many of them. Bacon Wrapped Scallops(pictured), Nachos, Platter for Two(pictured..mmmm), Coconut Tiger Shrimp(AMAZING), Calamari and Veggie Spring Rolls. I didn't get to sample everything, but considering how fast they went, I assume they were good. The nachos were fantastic as were the sweet potato fries and calamari. 

I ordered the Stuffed Chicken from the specials. It was bursting with goat cheese, asparagus and peppers. Loved it. A few people ordered the Prime Rib Special but, none of them left a morsel on their plates. Another popular choice was the Halibut and Chips. The piece of fish was huge and the fries were plentiful.  

The service was fantastic. She handled our crazy little group very well. She kept the drinks and our tummies full. 

It was a great venue for our party! Everyone loved it!"}
{"text":"Well well well. The dinning area is surprisingly large. Both a roof top and a main level patio. Atmosphere was really fantastic, although missing music. This place would really do well with it.

Both the Greek salad entree and pickerel fish dinner was amazing. I also had the Veggie spring rolls. Enjoyed our entire meal.

Finally, the desert and service was enviable. Polite, friendly and worked really hard to empress.

Don't take as long as I did to try this place. Will be back very soon."}
{"text":"When we (a party of 3) walked in, immediately the hostess told us dining in the restaurant was not an option due to the choice of clothes we wore, which was a sleeveless sport top; therefore, we were forced to sit outside on the patio.

After we were seated, momentarily our server Donna came and took our orders, this was the point where everything spiraled downhill:
1.  Donna asked us what we wanted to drink, so my friend asked her what's on tap.  Donna then proceeded to say \"it's in the menu\" in a very irritated tone; turned out there were only THREE beers on tap... was she really that lazy to simply list them?  Well, I guess I'm going to be as lazy like her to tip three bucks more.
2.  My other female friend was interested in the wings for their 'DOG HOT' spiciness level (which was their hottest option); my friend told her she was interested, but just wanted to ask if it was saucy or dry-spiced.  Donna told her to stop asking about it and just pick the 'Hot' option, that's when I stepped in and said \"NO, she can handle very spicy foods and she wanted to try the 'Hot Dog' option, so don't tell her which option to choose and just tell her if that option is saucy or dry-spiced\".  Donna then said \"it's neither saucy or dry-spiced\", which made no sense.

55 year-old looking Donna asked for our ID's since we ordered alcohol, she took one glance at my female friend's ID and said \"wow, you're old\" (my friend is 26 years old).

All the other tables that came and ordered after got their sweet potato fries sooner than us.  They managed to finish all their appetizers when not even ONE of ours came out, it was so obvious they put the other tables at a higher priority.

After waiting for 30 - 40 minutes, our food finally came out; at this point I was super upset and did not want to dine there anymore, so I asked for 4 take-out boxes so we can pack our untouched food, pay, & go.  But of course, Donna again said how that is not allowed.. she probably misunderstood me though, it's not because I'm taking advantage of their \"DINE-IN Monday Wings Night Special\", but it was genuinely because none of us wanted to see her face anymore LOL.

All our wings were cold/hard and our sweet potato fries tasted like cardboard sticks... at least sprinkle some salt into our basket of cardboard damn.

Overall, all three of us had a gruesome experience and paid $54 on a $52 bill, that extra two dollars was from us out of kindness in donation for her to attend attitude/personality therapy classes."}
{"text":"This quaint pub was a spontaneous lunch decision.   Thank goodness for Yelp!   We needed a place with an outdoor patio as we had our dog with us. 

We tried out the pulled pork sandwiches and a side garden salad.   The pulled pork was super juicy, soft and mixed with onions, served on a toasted ciabiatta bread.   The side salad wasn't too bad until I got to the middle.   The salad wasn't fresh, the leaves had started wilt and had several bug holes.   The portion size however was fair. 

Our server was super friendly.   Not only did she serve water to us, she also gave a bowl of ice water for our dog.   

The atmosphere was homey, with tons of locals popping in and a wedding in their side patio.   It's a nice change from your typical franchise pubs like the Keg.   Worthwhile checking out if you're in the area. 

4 stars for food and service, but minus one star for the unfresh salad."}
{"text":"This is a great English style pub. Dark wooden walls with a fireplace. Service  is alway very good. Bangers and Mash and wings are fabulous. Great place to meet friends.

Vince Boyko"}
{"text":"My brother and I headed back for lunch the other day. After work to get a bite and a beer. 

The bar area was full so we sat in the dinning area.  First off it took the servers 10 mins to figure which one would serve us.  Second the dinning area was a No Hat area.  Why the hostess did say anything was a surprise.  Ok. Hats off

My brother ordered their burger with cheese and bacon.  The bacon was the only thing with taste.  My brother said to the waitress the ketchup tasted good.  She did not get the inference.  

I got wings not bad but I had the French onion soup as a starter.  No taste at all. The wings were decent though. 

The only thing they did well was the beer.  I asked for a pop.  My glass was 1/2 filled with ice. 

If you want a brew. Stop by.  If you want a meal, get wings or go elsewhere.   Seriously nothing else is worth the bother. 

Tip: the bathrooms are downstairs.  If your knees have better days then take note."}
{"text":"First things first, I love dogs, so the name of this pub has always appealed to me, and I really wanted to like it! The black dog himself is on their logo!
The Black Dog is located in a rather quaint, older neighborhood on the Pickering-Scarborough border. The first two times I was there, The Dog was extremely crowded. I enjoyed the food very much, but found the atmosphere a bit chaotic (although the service was friendly and professional both times). To be fair, one of those occasions was Mother's Day Brunch, which is generally busy and hectic everywhere, so I decided to post my review after eating at the Black Dog during less busy times.
The traditional, vintage vibe of the neighborhood is echoed by the Black Dog's decor. It has the feel of an upscale British Pub, complete with dark woodwork and vintage touches. In winter, it's very cosy! In the summer, the patio provides a nice location to enjoy the sunshine. As has been noted by many reviewers, the staff is known for being friendly and helpful, and I have not been disappointed.
I am pleased to report that, at my recent meal at Black Dog, the food was as good as I had remembered. I ordered one of the weekly pasta specials, Garlic Shrimp Linguine. I mentioned to the waitress that I love shrimp with garlic, and she asked me, \"Would you like extra garlic?\" Oh yes! Great service, and this is how thoughtful, confident waitstaff can really enhance a dining experience.
My dining companion, a fan and repeat customer at the Black Dog,   always orders the Tropical Grilled Chicken Salad.  Apparently, she orders it every time, attributing its' greatness to the combination of healthy and flavourful, and that it is a salad that is like meal. The Black Dog has several salads on their menu which appear very creative, healthy and satisfying.
On this occasion, though, I was content with my rich, creamy, garlic-filled shrimp linguine. The shrimp was cooked skillfully -  plump and tender; the linguine was al dente without being too chewy.
If you want to pamper yourself on the Scarborough-Pickering border, try the Black Dog during non-peak hours. It's a bit expensive, but the quality of the food and thoughtful service that I have received justifies my choice of the Black Dog as a great place for a relaxing night out.
I just wonder - is there a story behind the eponymous Dog?

{"text":"Great spot in the rouge! Mostly locals - older crowd. They have an awesome roof top patio - probably the only one in the area. 

Food is amazing! My boyfriend and I actually get take out from here at least once a month. They are very accommodating when it comes to customizing dishes on the menu. 

Staff is always super friendly!! 

Only negative point - parking is limited. (But you park on the street - short walk)"}
{"text":"Most people in the area say this Pub serves the best food and I'd have to agree with them.  It is busy during the dinner rush but if you can get there a little earlier it is much better.  Service is always good, fast and attentive.   There is a wide assortment of food to choose from and all homemade.  So far, everything is tasty and plentiful.  Come hungry.  Best Pub in the East."}
{"text":"I went here for a Christmas party with fellow staff members. All-in-all, no complaints. It's seems like your basic dive bar, with plenty of local colour and regulars thrown into the mix. 
We had a \"party room\" of sorts, which was in the basement and was pretty basic, although it had a TV and fireplace and a sound system that allowed us to hook up someone's ipod. The small, square shape and rectangular tables left limited space for mingling though. The set up could have been better. 
Drinks were good and overall food was good, didn't see anything amazing though. I ordered schnitzel, which was fine. The mushroom gravy on top was amazing though, so make sure you go for that when offered. Quite out of the way for me though, so unless there is a party, I wouldn't be going out of my way to go back. Overall, good stuff though!"}
{"text":"It was not impressive by any stretch. They overdressed my salad and drown my son's pasta in butter. My steak was cold on my salad as well. The floor and tables were dirty. My waitress did not ask once how the food was. I won't be back."}
{"text":"A cozy pub with beautiful decor and wonderful staff. The tiny bartender with long hair is a pleasure to deal with. There's always a crowd of regular locals around the bar, and for good reason! The food is delicious, the beer selection is vast, the fireplace and TVs are situated perfectly... what more could you ask for? How about a hearty home-cooked meal on a Sunday night? I love their turkey dinner with all of the fixings... mm-mm! They also have live entertainment occasionally, and try not to dance! The music is top-notch. Young and old alike seem to flock here. I highly recommend giving the Black Dog a go!"}
{"text":"In the past I really enjoyed this pub but I recently went in for lunch with a customer and co-worker and we sat in the bar area. We had some food, drinks, and some laughs as people do but we were told by an older lady who worked there that we were too loud and they wouldn't serve us anymore. We were perfectly well behaved and not being loud, obnoxious, or rude and quite frankly, we were absolutely shocked when we were told that we had to go. Not once in the 3 hours we were there did anyone, including our waitress, approach us to say we were being too loud and/or acting in a unbecoming fashion. What made this all the more disappointing was the older ladies smug and condescending attitude towards us as customers. Regardless, we left a generous trip for our waitress and left. 

While I'm not one to judge a place based on a single negative experience with one employee, this was hugely disappointing and I personally would never go back again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I always have a good time. I actually really like coming in the summer because of the patio. The inside dining is cute, but kinda dark. 

Staff are always so friendly and on top of it, and it's one of those place that the staff will start to recognize you after a few visits. 

In terms of the food; I've managed to try a few things on the menu. Most of their food has that pub vibe (still good though)... the things that I love are below and I have included pictures too! 

1. Tropical Grilled Chicken Salad - Probably one of my favorite salads! It has grilled chicken (always juicy), mango salsa, avocado, walnuts, and goat cheese. Very Filling and love the colors and presentation. 

2. Baked Bruschetta Flatbread - Fresh Tomatoes, Onions, basil, and feta cheese (SO GOOD) 

3. Sweet Potato Fries - Ask for extra crispy, they are a great side! 

Really enjoy the atmosphere & food! 

Keep Eating,

Angela"}
{"text":"Love this pub because the food is amazing. The patio addition is very nice. Depending on the server it can be hit or miss for service."}
{"text":"I've come here quite consistently for the last 10 years, and no matter what the occasion the food, drinks, service and atmosphere are exactly what I'm looking for!  Great local menu that changes frequently and offers daily and weekly specials.  Their house beer that is brewed locally is always a good choice!  I've come here for nightly drinks as well as family lunches and date nights, the staff are always friendly and are available to answer any menu questions.  On my last occasion there I got  the turkey burger which was juicy and flavourful and had brie and some sort of cranberry sauce to tie it all together.  Everyone at our table loved the entrees and washed it down with some house beer.

It's a nice (somewhat) hidden gem of the east Scarborough area, would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"So the servers here are great. The decor is cosy, traditional pub-ish, but sadly the wallpaper is torn off in places throughout the restaurant area, it needs a bit of freshening up. They have an extensive menu, but it's not cheap and it's not really consistent. I keep wanting this place to do better so that we can really enjoy it. We've come here multiple times over the past year or so and it seems like the food has gotten worse and the prices are what one would expect to pay downtown (in fancier digs). Having said that, I'd come to the pub part to watch a Toronto FC game. I'll give this place one more shot, but sadly, I really don't feel like we've gotten our money's worth here for any meal."}
{"text":"If you love that old pub feel where the atmosphere is always friendly but you want more upscale food options then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This is our favourite Pub, and for good reason. We are here again tonight and they never fail to deliver a great experience. Lyndsey was our waitress and she was awesome. The food is beyond delicious! I would recommend this place to anybody who likes good pub food. I don't know any place in the GTA that's better."}
{"text":"The food and service here is decent but after reading the hidden reviews of the yelpers that weren't so pleased with their experience I can see why. First off I can see why most aren't too keen on the owner - even while I was there today he was giving another customer a hard time - but whatever. The thing that gets me is that it's a bar /pub feel but you're expected to take your hat off while you're dining there -  even for lunch. Ok maybe there were some business type people there dining but it's still a bar... and it's lunch. Whatever. Like I said the food is decent and maybe its a hidden gem but if this place is not really an upscale dining establishment (which it isn't) I don't see where wearing a hat is an infraction and if it's all about being polite and showing manners by removing a hat ; then seeing and reading how the owner treats some patrons I think he needs to reevaluate this double standard."}
{"text":"We live walking distance to this great neighborhood pub.  It's definitely one of those places where they remember you by name after a couple of visits.  Their food is probably above average pub fare but nothing to write home about if you're looking for a fantastic dining experience.  Then again, who goes to a pub looking for the best dining experience??   We've tried pretty much everything on their menu over 2 years and so far, their ruben sandwich takes the cake.  Their smoked menus are a bit disappointing since it really lacks the \"fall off the bone\" and smokiness I've come to love from other places like Phil's BBQ.  What makes Black Dog so special is the atmosphere.  This is a great place to get together with friends for pints.  Love their Dog red."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm going to get leached for this but I don't understand the hype of this place. It's a neighbourhood hot spot so I've been here countless times over I don't even know how many years. 

The atmosphere is a little to dark for my liking & the track to the bathroom drives me
nuts! I always find it a little crowded. Plus it's always such a sausage fest. So many men, not my cup of tea at all.

The food & drinks are nothing to ride home about, especially for the price. They're by no means bad but I haven't found anything I truly enjoyed. 

They have a heated patio that's nice in the colder months. I'd go back if a friends birthday or something was held there but I would never go on my own."}
{"text":"Great spot for drinks and some pub grub. Burger is highly recommended, as are the nachos. Wings are slightly above average and the steak - well, don't go to a pub for steak. I learned that the $23 hard way. Aside from the overpriced steak, everything else seemed to be reasonably priced...go figure i'd try the most expensive thing and get burned!

As for the main draw...the drinks: lots of great stuff on tap including Boddington's...one that is sometimes tough to find. Mmmm. 

As mentioend, prices are reasonable and there used to be some great happy hour specials...not sure if those are still around though.

Crowd is a bit older but in this part of Scarborough, the options are limited. They have live bands playing a few nights a week and a great patio. 

All in all, a great place!"}
{"text":"Never a disappointment. So happy to have discovered this bar & patio. The food and atmosphere is fantastic."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it 4.5 stars!!! 

Decor:  Nice and cozy, wood burning fireplace and really nice stained glass light fixtures add to the casual yet cozy atmosphere.

Service:  The waitress (Tara) was REALLY great.  She was patient with our kids and answering the numerous questions our party had about the food.  Drinks were re-filled before we even asked and she delivered extra napkins for our messy kids.

Food: The menu is great, something for everyone. I ordered the Lamb Burger with Ceaser Salad....excellent.  Hubby ordered the burger, kids ordered the chicken pot pie and fish and chips...all excellent...picky kids cleared their plate.

Drinks:  They do a great gin and tonic.

It's so hard to find a restaurant that has it all..good food, clean & nice decor, great service, reasonable prices....this place has it all."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and service we excellent as soon as we walked through the entrance. They have a great patio and good selection of drinks and food. I ordered the salmon burger with side salad and my friend ordered the lamburger (happened to be the last one) and he really enjoyed it. The salmon burger could be better but I still really enjoyed it.

Overall I occasionally recommend this place to friends or people who are visiting or know the area because the service is great and the food is good too. I also recommend their in house brewed beer. It's good!"}
{"text":"Pricey food. Good service. A bit run down.

Location: just south of hwy 401 near Port Union Rd., Scarborough. Since there is no other restaurant in the area, most local folks I know just go here because it's convenient not because it is especially good (I'm one of those people)

Atmosphere: British pub. A couple of indoor fireplaces and a two tier patio. a bit run down in areas (torn wallpaper, stained carpeting, etc.)

Food: if you stick to pub grub like burgers, fish and chips, wings, etc. you'll be okay. Food tends to be a bit pricey though ($16 for a burger thats worth $10)

Service: service is friendly and efficient. No complaints here

The black dog was a bit of a Scarborough institution back in the day  (ie 20 years ago) but now it's just coasting on its reputation. Okay for a quick beer and a burger, but nothing else"}
{"text":"We visited the Rouge River, Valley and Beach today (which is amazing), and after having worked up an appetite and a half, my lovely wife and I went for a great tasty dinner on the top patio of The Black Dog Pub. If it was a hot sunny day, I'd say there is plenty of shade but it was a cool sunset eve. Awesome patio overall. They have another patio on the lower lever, with even greater shade. 

After sitting down, we started with a couple pints of beer, made locally, a plate of bruschetta, and for mains endulged in a salmon and lamb burger respectively. We were blown away by the taste. To add, it was brought in a timely fashion, fresh and hot.

The decor is something you would compare to that of Moxies, Milestones, The Keg or the like. This place is better than the aforementioned for example, as we noted chairs and a couch by a fireplace. Incredible. This restaurant pub was catering to the finely dressed, the cooler golf style, or the beachwear bummers like us :) The staff were very professional, and courteous.

If you're heading through Toronto on the 401, just in the area, or coming back from the local beach, go have a meal here. One of the best places, if not the best place, in the local area. Trust me, I grew up close by and spent 14 years in the Neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Just off the 401 this pub / eatery has some of the best food around. It is in the middle of no where which means it is usually filled with locals from around the area which can make it hard to find seating if you have not made a reservation. Certain nights also have special events like live bands. 

The food itself is superb. The 3 different dishes we tried were all very we prepared. I look forward to going back again to try something new. 

Just remember to make a reservation or you'll be stuck at the bar."}
{"text":"Came here with my family on a Thursday and there was a live band which was really entertaining! I got the schnitzel and mashed potatoes, I suggest getting the mushroom sauce with it (but on the side so you can control the portion). The staff was friendly and attentive and the food was alright. I liked the decor, it was very classic pub."}
{"text":"This little pub so more than it meets the eye.  They have a cozy feel that makes you think your eating at home and they have a good selection of dishes to choose from along with features of the day.

Portions are good and good is tasty and they have a live band at night.  Winner!"}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem burried all the way east down in the Rogue Valley area. Lucky for me I live in the area so my only regret is Why I never checked this place out sooner!

As we pull up to the packed parking lot (always a good sign) we are lucky to snag a spot as someone was pulling out otherwise be prepared to park on the boardering streets. Definitely make reservations!! (learned this the hard way on a previous attempt) The pub was packeddd! As we entered I didn't see a hostess but the bartender was kind enough to point us in the right direction, telling us to head to the main dining room which was just off to the left. There I saw the hostess desk.

Our table for our party of four was waiting for us with a reserved sign placed in the centre. The dining room itself is rather small but cozy equipped with a wood burning fire place. Dim lighting, wall papered walls with framed paintings mostly of Black Dogs and aged wooden tables complete the decor.

The menu contains a good selection of traditional pub fare, a creative sandwich line up, health conscious options and hearty quality mains. The also have daily specials and desserts to keep things lively.

To start we decide to order a Pizza (changes daily)  from the specials menu.

Smoked Chicken Pizza - Golden crisp crust, with a smokey bbq base, ample amounts of gooey melty cheese, carmelized onions and tender strips of smoked chicken totally knocked our socks off. A great start to a fab meal!

I'm a definite sandwich lover and after seeing there impressive line up I knew a wanted to try one! But there was one winner that definitely drew me in!

Smokehouse Pulled Pork Sandwich + sweet potato fries  -Smoked In House for 16 hours tossed with carmelized onions and guiness bbq sauce on a toasted 9 grain ciabatta bun
First off this was a massive a sandwich and no skimping on meat they definitely piled it on. The meat was soo tender and juicy and you could definitely taste depth of smokiness with a good coating of that delicious guiness bbq sauce and those yummy carmelized onions. I was in heaven! Sweet potato fries were also pretty good!

Other orders at the table included

Shepherd's pie + fresh cut fries - Huge pie, quality ingredients with rich filling topped with creamy whipped potatoes. And those fresh cut fries are a must try also!

Bangers and Mash - Grilled English sausages, house made mashed potatoes and gravy, served with rustic baked beans
Needless to say this plate was left spotless.

Crunchy Spinach Salad + Grilled Steak -Baby spinach, housemade sunflower raspberry vinaigrette,toasted walnuts, crispy bacon, craisins, mandarin oranges, bermuda onions, goat cheese and oven roasted portbello mushrooms
Hearty salad with fresh quality ingredients and perfectly cooked medium steak

For Desserts we ordered the Carmel Crunch Cake and Chocolate Banana Cake. Again both cakes were Hugeee slices. We loved both the cakes moist delicious gorgous just  yummmm!

Overall Fantastic Food, Hugee portions, and Top notch friendly service! Far passed our expectations, I can definitely see why this place is always packed! If there was ever a reason to treck all the way to the East end I believe this is it! But definitely make reservations first!

A full out band was performing oldies and country music on the bar side and few people even broke out into dance."}
