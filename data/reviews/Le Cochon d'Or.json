{"text":"Wonderful dinner.  Simple ambience of candle light and warm colors. We started with the grilled leeks, then a serving of risotto with mushrooms followed by the main course of bison short ribs with grits. The chef incorporated the French style of cooking with a southern flair. We were disappointed when Heritage left but we are happy now that this delightful replacement is here."}
{"text":"We love this new French restaurant located in the heart of a Waxhaw. I lived in France for 10 years and my husband is French! The quality of food is superb, the ambience is modern & sophisticated and the service on point and discrete!  We love the overall experience!"}
{"text":"We ate here Friday night for the first time since it's opened and it didn't dissapoint! We ordered the butcher's board as an appetizer and it had several different types of meat that I can't name now but they were all good and came with more of the amazing bread! For meals I ordered the diver's scallops with risotto and the scallops were huge and seared perfectly. The risotto was creamy and had a great flavor to it. My husband got the lamb and said it was delicious as well. For dessert we ordered the chocolate souflle which takes about 15 minutes but it worth the wait. Definitely order this! So good!"}
{"text":"A wonderful addition to the Waxhaw food scene.... in the same location as Heritage was for the last 4 years... owner Patrick Garrivier has made a terrific atmosphere in this somewhat small but now very warm and friendly place.  All staff were experts and right on top of everything.  Menu is a mix of small plates and terrific entrees.  Very nice portions of all three groups, French bread and butter were simply over the top.  Desserts looked great , but just not enough room. My entrée was a evening special that was braised lamb with vegetables... terrific.  Lobster Bisque was also excellent.  comfortable and QUIET atmosphere made it nice and certainly unique to WXW."}
{"text":"This French restaurant is amazing. At the time of writing Le Cochon D'Or (French for Golden Pig) has only been open for 7 weeks. Fantastic place for  a romantic date and the French cuisine was wonderful. Note : if you're looking for low fat, low cholesterol fare this is not the place to be. From its deliciously high fat whipped butter for your wonderfully crisp French bread, to their amazing mussels with French fries, or their wonderfully tasty butchers block of European meats and chicken liver (which was very very good), this was a rare treat where both my foodie date and I were delighted with wonderful dish after dish. From the same owner as Provence in Charlotte, the owner, Patrick, is originally from Lyon, France and succeeded in bringing a true spirit of French cuisine to Charlotte/Waxhaw while being accessible to American tastes.  Bravo to the culinary team at Le Couchon D'Or!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Many thanks to the owner and staff for accommodating my elderly in laws with such kindness and respect.  Every dish we ordered was superb.  Appetizers were mussels, cheese plate and foie gras.  Foie Gras was the best ever.  Lamb was perfectly cooked.  Crispy chicken was delicious.  Highly rec chocolate soufflé for dessert-rich and a beautiful presentation.  Order this early in the meal as it takes time to prepare. The pavlova was light and topped with homemade berry sorbet.  Mint flavored creme completed the dessert.  We will be back soon!"}

{"text":"We were able to get same day reservations but a little late for us that particular evening. It was packed when we arrived. I loved the new look of the place with the sparkling candlelight and new bar. It was just what I had hoped for. We were on time and gracefully greeted and seated immediately.  We ordered sparkling water and they brought out the wonderful French bread and two little cheesey type of bisquits that were so light and flaky!  Oh my!  We enjoyed our appetizer of foie gras very much. Our dinners were superb!  My fiancée ordered the rack of lamb and I ordered the scallops!  They were both cooked perfectly. The sizes were just right for us!  Our wait staff was efficient. I wanted to give 5 Stars but we had to wait for our wine longer than I am accustomed  and for the chocolate soufflé as well. Our coffee was long gone by the time the dessert came out. I love chocolate soufflés and I have enjoyed many over the years. I could not eat this one because it was too salty for me. I always use salt when I'm cooking but I never over use it. My fiancé thought the soufflé tasted ok. Just ok though. I even asked for some one else's opinion and the person who prepared it tasted it and thought it was fine. So this left me disappointed because I read all the reviews about how delicious it was. It left me puzzled as well. Will I be back???  You betcha!!!!!  I want to try everything on the menu!  So grateful to have this wonderful French restaurant in our town!!!"}
{"text":"We went to French restaurant, Le Cochon d'Or a few weeks ago for the first time and we were all very pleased with the cuisine we had the pleasure enjoying for dinner!  It started with French bread and butter...we have to be honest here, the first bread we received could crack a tooth, but the second serving was warm, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.  The Lobster appetizer was perfectly cooked with orzo that was fantastic and perfectly creamy.  We also had fried oysters that were deliciously crisp.  Dinner consisted of the diver scallops and roasted rack of lamb.  Both meals were prepared very well and excellent.  We all had the chocolate soufflé and it was luscious and very rich.  Make sure you leave room for it if you're interested!  We loved our server Erika, who we've known from the previous restaurant residing there.  She's warm, friendly and wonderful.  She's also a fabulous server and we were so happy to see her there!  People like Erika make you want to keep coming back!  The owner is very warm and welcoming and takes a lot of pride in his restaurant which is lovely to see.  He may want to trust his servers a bit more because he never stopped going back and forth from the kitchen out to the tables.  It's a bit overwhelming when you sit anywhere near the kitchen and so many people are just passing back and forth while you're eating.  All in all, great atmosphere with relaxing music in the background...add rich, luscious food and we'll be back!"}
