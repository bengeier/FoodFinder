{"text":"Pretty disappointing compared to Planta in Yorkville - this is a fast-food/take-away style burger  place with long lines due to the popularity of its more upscale sister restaurant. The menu is very limited, there are 4 types of burgers, two salads, four sides (fries and tots mostly) and then an option for a milkshake.   The burgers are interesting but not amazing in taste, served in takeout dishes. They cost 10.95$ and include no sides, the sides are all around 4 dollars. My friend got the small salad as a side and said it was extremely salty. Portions aren't that big.  It's one of the first vegan burger places around, and definitely in a convenient area of the downtown, so I don't want to give it a terrible review. But it could be much much better. I miss Bare Burger, that had bigger and better tasting veggie burgers, but that suddenly shut its doors a couple of months ago.  Anyways, really wouldn't come back or recommend it to my other veg friends. You're better off going to Fresh for one of their vegan burgers, or going to the original Planta for a beautiful/upscale-ish sitdown restaurant experience."}
{"text":"The food is a let down. Looks much better on social media. My chopped salad was the saltiest thing ever and the 'classic burger' was dry and prepared in a very sloppy way. I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"Three types of veggie burgers. We shared the Jack fruit and the classic. They were both great. The classic was not a typical soy burger. It has the appearance of medium rare (red in the middle). The burgers are small. 10.00 for a burger and fries is reasonable but you may need 2. I added on queso fries (and paid for) but they forgot and I didn't realize until I got home so check your order. The cook also yelled at one of the other staff so it was bit uncomfortable."}
{"text":"One of the best vegetarian burger place in town.  Consistent flavors and good service.  The place congested during peak hours.  I would highly recommend the place.  Try the buffalo cauliflower!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's filling and plant based! Went here on a cool yet sunny Friday afternoon. It was packed but people move in and out fast so my group of 6 go to sit at the outside bar.   I got the \"crab cake\" burger and I must say, I would've been fooled. Fries were yummy too. If you're looking to save money, Ritual has discounted prices for two out of the four burgers.  I'd come here again :)"}
{"text":"this was insane! we had the buffalo cauliflower burger with the bbq spicy fries and the california burger with buffalo cauliflower. so delicious! definitely returning."}
{"text":"Great burgers. The onion rings to die for. Cauliflower? Give me two please. Staff is great. The manager is the coolest. It is my go to spot. Super super good."}
{"text":"What a pleasant change with the price point and keeping it simple approach towards food. I visited their Planta sans the burger location and wasn't impressed. This location has more of a quick meal approach. The seating is a bit tight inside and boy the music is loud here. 4 Options for the burger (my friends had ordered the classic and I had tried the crab cake entree' and other place and were not impressed) I opted for the California option (hey there are songs about life in California so I am biased). Their burgers do come with a side unlike what was reported by another person here with an 50 cent up charge if you want to substitute the fries with another option of sides. I opted for the onion rings. The burger itself was decent as far as vegan versions go and I enjoyed the onion rings quite a bit. The jury is still out for the fries as they felt under cooked again and the toppings didn't improve things by much. At this price point I think we have a good value proposition here folks as one can easily spend that much on junk food.  I will revisit."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, waited approximately a billion years (give or take I'm bad at math) for my burger because it was insanely busy, but the patio was sunny and there was cucumber water so it was a pretty chill wait.   My burger had an obscene amount of guacamole and sort of fell apart and there is probably avocado in my hair now, but it was really quite delicious, flavourful and not at all like the sad veggie burgers of my youth.   I also had a side of buffalo cauliflower. Which was also definitely not healthy but had some sort of cheese like buffalo sauce on it and was pretty legit, so I ate it all.   Good lunch option. Going to shower now."}
{"text":"Funny, I went to the Planta restaurant on Bay and had the burger and just found it ok. So I was a little leery of trying the burger at Planta Burger, but peer pressure prevailed. Holy! that was SO GOOD. Just ordered the straight up burger with pickles, tomatos, onion etc...not a large burger but it was good. Like I want one every day good. And those bbq fries....yes yes yes please."}
{"text":"I heard of this place after going to the Planta restaurant and I'm very impressed ! The aesthetic of the store is super pretty and atmosphere is great. Great price for the burger as well though it tasted like a burger you could make at home. The fries and onion rings were great ! Super happy about all the new vegan restaurants in town  Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I decided to try this out after reading an article. Planta Burger is almost like a fast food place, where you line up to order and you get a number. I've order the California burger Smashed avocado, tomatoe, queso cheese, pickled onion and banana peppers The patty has beans inside. I didn't enjoy the texture. The bun, I find a bit dry.  If you select bunless, it will be wrapped in lettuce. I've also ordered the Classic and the crab cake. Out of the three I think the crab cake was the better option. All meals came with fries and the fries had spices sprinkled on already.   Probably won't come back again..."}
{"text":"I came here on a nice Friday afternoon and had a craving for burgers. As I'm on a plant based diet, burgers are hard to come by, especially a good tasting one.  I've had the burger from the Planta restaurant before and it is delicious. I ordered the Jackpot burger and while it was tasty, it was kind of soggy.  I also ordered loaded queso fries, which essentially is a vegan version of chili cheese fries.  It was okay.    Personally, I think the burger at the Planta restaurant is better.  They seem to take more care and pride in the food there.  However, keep in mind, that the combo here cost me about $13 and usually the combo at Planta proper costs more like $25 + tax and tip.    Would I visit again? Sure, but I wouldn't make a special trip just for one of their vegan burgers."}
{"text":"Planta burger looked amazing on social media but it was a bit of a let down when I finally got a chance to try it. The place itself is located on a nice quiet street in central downtown right by the Eaton centre. The service and staff waz amazing.   The food was just okay. We ordered the cali burger, the crab cake burger, onion rings and spicy fries. The best part was the onion rings; crispy and the sauce complemented it so well! Up next was the cali burger which went very well with the toppings but I didn't find it so special that I have to get it again. The crab cake burger was bland and underwhelming, and the bun was quite dry. The fries are good as a side dish but would I get it again? Probably not."}
{"text":"Came in on the weekend. Heating was on full blast and honestly was way too hot inside. I was sweating!  Ordered California burger which tasted great and crab cake one which I could've done without. Crab cake one had a pickle in it despite not saying that on their menu. I don't like pickles so I wish they would've stated it instead of me picking it out.   Got tots which were alright. And buffalo cauliflower which seemed undercooked as I could taste and see the batter inside.   Overall was alright. I probably wont return to this location but I want to try they're other location before making my Final decision."}
{"text":"This place lived up to the hype. I had the Californian burger and side Caesar salad. Patty was perfectly cooked but if anything could have been a bit thicker. Definitely sit on the patio - fun spot to people watch"}
{"text":"I have been vegan for two years, in that time I've had hundreds of veggie burgers from chains like Harvey's to independent Vegan restaurants like Fresh. Nothing beats the Classic burger from Planta Burger. It along with the Cauli flower hot wings, holy hell you can't go wrong!!! MUST. TRY. for both meat eaters and vegans alike!"}
{"text":"Loved this joint. Their buffalo cauliflower side is a must as well as their tater tots. Definitely will be back to try more menu items! Only suggestion I have for the restaurant is to allow for substitutions when ordering a meal. I had the burger and the price included fries. I had to pay the full cost of another side and still paid for the fries (even though I didnt ask/receive them)."}
{"text":"Happy to find this vegan place delivery but the burgers were not as grandiose as they were shown on social media. More flat and sad. With no smashed avocado as promised. $40 for 2 burgers, fries with Bombay street food spice, and a great salad. Kinda pricey but delicious enough. Salad had red peppers, tomatoes, olives, red onion and herbs which is right up my alley. The burgers should have been loaded for that price though.    Cheaper, healthier and more plentiful to get a mushroom nut burger from CrudaCafe though where you don't have to pay extra for salad.  FYI- the crab burger and cauliflower burger/wings are NOT gluten free. The Cali burger, Classic burger, Caesar salad and slaw are!  Been having a lot of trouble with consistency/quality/following directives after ordering over 12 burgers. They're sorting it out and I will reorder from them when they do."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night at about 7:15pm and was turned away! The girl at the counter said they were not serving food any longer as they had only one cook. She was pretty abrupt and rude. Their hours are posted as open until 7:30pm - if those are your hours you should be prepared to serve customers until then. Really too bad because I had been excited to try it out and really liked Planta, but will not return based on this strange encounter."}
{"text":"We had the California and the Classic burger with onion rings and BBQ fries. I must say it did't impress my tastebuds as I was hoping, but it was a great experience getting to try the famous Planta burgers. I would truly recommend it if you are a vegan... if not just go to Five Guys or Richmond Station and get a real burger there!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian and now I know why! Planta Burger didn't come close to convincing me vegetarian food is just as good. The burger patty fell apart, the buffalo cauliflower wasn't that crispy and the french fries were slightly under cooked. The tatter tots were tasty, but maybe over seasoned with rosemary."}
{"text":"Parties are so thin that resembles cookies.  Great concept, so needed in Toronto. But not substantial. Will not come back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the burger, definitely one of the better vegan burgers I've had in awhile. It tasted quite reminiscent of a Big Mac actually. But that's about all I can say that really impressed me. The fries were good except I was not a fan of the sauce they put on top. And the prices were in my view unacceptably high for a fast food-style burger joint, even if it is vegan and natural and blah blah blah. You are looking at about $20 for a burger, side, and drink - chalk it up as a hipster tax?"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and it was quite busy! The burger itself is good - it's a bean based patty with vegan cheese. I wanted to try it after hearing reviews of Planta. Even though it was good, I will still be eating juicy, beef burgers"}
{"text":"Planta Burger is one of the first vegan quick service spots in Toronto. The location is great, the prices are reasonable, and Planta has enjoyed a lot of buzz since their debut about a year ago. In short, we had to check it out.  We've had mixed experiences at Planta, and unfortunately this was no different.  - The crab cake burger ($10.75, flat rate for all burgers here) was bland and underfilled. The hearts of palm were crushed into a soggy mess, but the pieces outside of the bun were nice and crispy.  - The buffalo cauliflower burger (again, reasonable at $10.75) was okay, although not a standout in texture or flavor.  - The onion rings ($3.75) were the best part of our meal! Nice texture and sauce, delicate and crisp. Maybe a touch underseasoned.  - The tots ($3.75) were a massive disappointment. The cauliflower tots at Planta's flagship were if basic and overpriced, but these were just awful. Burnt outside, wet paste inside, and some creamy sauce on top to cover it up. I assume this is just a one-off, as the brand knows how to do decent tots. Let's chalk it up to growing pains.  - The ice cream sandwich ($6.00) is incredibly dense. It consists of icy coconut ice cream smeared between two chocolate-oatmeal-peanut butter cookies. The cookies are too thick for the amount of ice-cream, which could be creamier.  ***On a more serious note, they really need to mention that these sandwiches contain PEANUTS on the menu. One of my friends is allergic, and took a bite without knowing. It's irresponsible and dangerous not to note such a common (and sometimes life-threatening) allergen.***  Overall, our experience was not the best. I hope this place improves as they work through their launch phase, and I hope they start listing that their cookies and ice-cream sandwiches contain peanuts so that allergic guests don't unwittingly consume them."}
{"text":"I was super hyped for Planta, and they didnt fail to disappoint! I got the crab cake burger which came with a side fries but i substituted for onion rings (+$0.50). The burger was super crispy and delicious for the first few bites. After it could get a little mushy, but it was still tasty. The onion rings were my favorite! Very flavourful batter and crunchy fried goodness. I also tried the fries whicu were also good and had some cajun seasoning atop them.  Will be back to try out the other items."}
{"text":"Okay, so not flawless, but pretty friggen good. Plant-based isn't super easy to find yet, and in the downtown core, this is a great option.  Not sure why people are hating on the prices; normal takeout of this level costs the same, and it's in one of the most expensive areas of the city. I got a burger and fries for $15 and feel like that totally reasonable.  The staff were a bit alouf and largely joking with each other versus paying any attention to service, but it was quick. It can get crazy busy, but mid afternoon it's empty.  The menu seems to switch up a bit, but The Classic is always a great staple. Fries are tasty, but nothing unique. Queso is really good, but makes the fries soggy for sure.  The burger is great; not exactly a mock meat (in case that's what you're after) but a bit of a different flavour than most veggie patties.  I absolutely recommend people give it a shot."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place the same rating at Planta Yorkville for similar reasons: the food didn't blow me away (for the prices they charge), and it's not much for what you pay. They either need to add more sides to justify the prices, or increase the portion sizes (and NOT the fries portion, please). Service was decidedly lacklustre and sullen. Nobody looks happy to be working here."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place when on the way to watch a The musical. I must say, the staff were very friendly, and I really enjoyed their food! The burgers were great, even as a meat lover. However, their onion rings were possibly some of the best onion rings I've ever had, thanks to their amazing sauce they put on. I highly recommend this place! They even serve beer!"}
{"text":"I'm no vegan, but Planta Burger has turned into a regular for me.  The menu is pretty simple - four kinds of burgers, a number of sides, and drinks.  All of it vegan (or 'plant-based' as they call it).  The burgers are quite good - a bit messy to eat because they're bean based and the patties tend to fall apart, but tasty and enjoyable.  The best one is the classic burger.  The california burger is a real mess, and winds up just being kind of bland.  Jackfruit burger and \"crab cake\" burger are both good.  As for sides - I've had three.  Regular fries are way too salty (or at least they were the last time I had them).  Onion rings are fine.  But what is really good is the fried cauliflower.  Spicy, and really enjoyable.  There's an upcharge to get anything other than fries with your burger, but it is definitely worth it to get the cauliflower.  Service is friendly and relatively quick.  Seating can be a bit tight, but it seems like a lot of their business is takeout."}
{"text":"Yummy! Very satisfying veggie burgers! I had the Californian and loaded fries.  So good! I was surprised at how filling the burger was!  I was with a group of 6, including a certified carnivore, and we all loved our meals!  This is a takeout place, but there are a few seats.  Kinda industrial looking but it will do nicely if you're stopping by for a quick bite.  Absolutely worth trying if you're vegetarian, and even if you're not!"}
{"text":"I decided to order from this place after learning that it's not a far walk from Ryerson University. After reading several reviews, I ordered 2 Cali Burger and onion rings. The onion rings were amazing as everyone said they were. I personally liked the Cali Burger, but my boyfriend did not. For vegans who like the meaty texture of soy burgers, this is probably not the place for you, as their burgers are bean based. Because of this, the burger tends to crumble so it's a bit of a messy meal.  I would also recommend calling ahead on the phone to order since there are quite a lot of people during the lunch rush (I went in around 1pm). I was able to skip the line and pick up my food right away."}
{"text":"BBQ Jackfruit burger was delicious. only thing i would change is that the kale slaw was a bit too saucy but overall the most flavorful vegan burger ive ever had! highly recommended.  it comes with fries for $10.50 +tax. fries are good as well.   last time the fries came drenched with too much sauce,m which ruined them,  but they dont put the sauce on them anymore."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Planta so when a friend suggested going to Planta Burger, I went with somewhat high expectations.   We went around 4:30pm on a Thursday afternoon and there was no one else there but us which turned out great. It was a small but cozy restaurant with a nice patio for warm summer days. They also have a water dispenser on the side which is always appreciated.   We ordered the Cali Burger, the Crab Cake burger, the spiced fries and the onion rings. The burgers are all priced at 10.50 each and the size was alot smaller than I expected (about a palm size). Out of the two that we ordered, I liked the Cali Burger the most. The flavours were much more to my liking than the Crab Cake burger. The bun itself on the Crab Cake burger was way too thick and fluffy and just took the texture away from the patty. Like other reviews mentioned, the onion rings were the best part of the meal. It was crisp to the core so if you're not a fan of that, maybe opt for the fries. The spicy fries were decent but nothing out of the ordinary.  All in all, I'd give Planta Burger 4 stars. It's definitely a nice vegan option in the area!"}
{"text":"We had a pleasant experience with the staff. The food, however, did not meet our expectations. The buffalo fries were good as well as the onion rings (can't say I enjoyed them because they were pretty basic). They had a nice flavour. The buffalo cauliflower was a huge disappointment. There was too much undercooked batter and the flavour was way off. There was too much heat and spice level was too high with minimal flavour. Needed to have more of a balance of flavours. We also had the classic burger and the crab cake burger. The classic burger patty had a simple flavour which was ok but the crab cake patty was way too small for the burger.  Would I go out of my way to visit this place again or any of the other Planta restaurants? Probably not."}
{"text":"Just okay. I was excited to try Planta Burger because I'm a frequent visitor of their sister restaurant Planta (which I love). I went with a friend so we were able to sample quite a few dishes. The best in my opinion was 'the classic' burger ($10.50) which I would go back for if I had a burger craving. Everything else was mediocre to just plain bad- the salted  caramel vanilla milkshake ($7.50) was overly sweet, runny, and tiny, the caesar salad ($7.75) looked like it had been sitting for a while and didn't taste fresh, the buffalo cauliflower wings ($5.00) were so soggy and vinegary that I had to stop eating them, and finally the spicy fries ($3.50) were good except for the luke warm lemony sauce that was put on top and didn't match the flavour profile. I left the restaurant feeling unsatisfied, slightly nauseous from the wings, and like I wasted my money."}
{"text":"I went here to buy a milk shake which I have bought many times before. It was AWFUL. The girl making it seemed to be new and didn't seem like she was trained properly as she was very hesitant. I spent 10 min waiting for a milkshake which I could tell wasn't being made well. After that she put my order which was only the milkshake on the counter and didn't call out my order. I waited a few more minutes and had to ask for the milkshake my self. When I drank it, it was the most awful tasting thing ever that I tossed it. Never again. Staff need to be better trained at making things as well as customer service that doesn't require someone waiting more then 10 min for a single drink."}
