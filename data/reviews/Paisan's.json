{"text":"We have been here many times over the years, and it seems they really would like us not to return. They try really hard to turn us off on Paisan's, but we keep coming back! But no more. We went just before 6 p.m on Saturday, Sept. 8, and walked in the door. Not fewer than five workers at the cash register stared at us. Not one of them said a word. No \"welcome!\" Nothing. We looked at each other, like, \"Are they not going to say hello or greet us?\" Just a 5-person stare. We walked up and said, \"We need a table for 2.\" It was as if we were aliens. If we wanted a view, it would be 20 minutes. With no view, 5 minutes, even though there were plenty of tables with no view that we could see, that had no people at them. So we go to the bar to wait. Again, it was as if we wore clothes that said, \"Please ignore us. Do not wait on us. Do not talk to us.\" We sat at the bar many minutes before a female bartender finally asked us whether we'd been helped. Again, it was not all that busy. Our server was so-so. We just felt so unwelcome. It was busy with Ironman participants as guests, but there were no Ironman specials or any \"Welcome Ironman\" signs. You have a captive Ironman audience, but yet you ignore it. You could have done a lot with Ironman promoting. Wow. I feel like I should do your marketing. We had large Porta salads and spicy cheese bread. Usually the salads wow us, but not this time. Could have been all the ignoring going on. I mean, our cash is as green as the next guy's!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the Madison area. I have been to Paisan's a couple of times and always had good service and good food. It is nice to have the option to look at the lake or sit in a private booth.  The toasted spicy cheese bread isn't too spicy as an appetizer but you don't want to get too full because the dinners are awesome. The pizza is really good but I usually order a dinner. The cannelloni is my favorite and you get hot bread which is always a great plus. My friend had the spicy meatball sandwich last time and could not finish. The prices are reasonable and I always bring home the leftovers for lunch the next day.  If you are looking for good Italian food this is one place not to miss."}
{"text":"My husband and I started going to Paisan's over 30 years ago when we attended UW-Madison. We don't often get back to town, so when we do we look forward to a little nostalgia.  We just took our family there for lunch. The food and atmosphere are as we remember, but the staff needs some serious training in hospitality. When your customers leave and say goodbye and thank you, DO NOT IGNORE THEM! There were 3 to 4 hosteses/servers standing at the front as we left, and not one of them acknowledged us."}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour last night. The drinks were cheap ($2 for a stein, and $3.50 for a strong Long Island), and because we got there right before the end of happy hour, they let us pre-order our second round for later. The bar has a cool set-up.  I agree with other reviews -- the food is not good. Really unexceptional.  I'd go here just for drinks."}
{"text":"I ordered porta salad for a party of 10 to pick up at a designated time and it 1. Wasn't ready when we got there to pick it up 2. Didn't include dressing and 3. Was $53. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positive: even though it was dark out, I could tell that the view would be amazing given a bit more light. The service was adequate, as the food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and my water was promptly refilled.  That said, the food was flat out awful. The four of us got the 16 inch Deluxe pizza (sausage, peppers, mushrooms, and mozzarella for $25) and some mozzarella sticks (~$8). Aside from a distinct burned flavor, the pizza was astoundingly tasteless and bland that I resorted to spooning some of the (bargain-bin, frozen) mozzarella sticks' marinara in an attempt to make it slightly enjoyable. That effort failed.  I wish there were true redeeming features to call out, but you can honestly eat better with frozen goods from Hy-Vee for less than half the price. We left some of the pizza at the table, we just couldn't stomach any more."}
{"text":"Not impressed, especially given the reputation that it's a great place. It started with not being able to sit in the main room and we got taken down a long hall in a secluded room full of booths, with a loud fan and a dark, lonesome, secluded setting. The space between the table and bench is quite large so makes it awkward being so far from your food. The spicy cheese bread was about the only thing that gets a 3/4 star. Otherwise, the food was just crummy- Mozzerella sticks, Cesar salad (served with ginormous portions of dressing), pizza was bland with dry and hard crust and littler cheese and the Monday pasta special was just pasta, nothing special and could be made at home much better. Several of the pasta dishes came with very little sauce and the server came sparingly to check on us, and didn't even make it to run the check and we paid up front. The only thing that made this experience is being with family, and that was the point of going out for dinner!"}
{"text":"The location  is great, and I  wanted to like this place? But the food was very  overpriced  and less than  mediocre.  Perhaps  next time we'll  try the puzza, but then again,  maybe  we'll  skip the whole thing. ..."}
{"text":"Sausage and green pepper dish excellent!  The only thing better was the service. I will go again."}
{"text":"Great location with outdoor seating with the view of Lake Monona.  Good, decent Italian food.  Pizza has a great thin crust - one of my favorite in Madison.  Toppings tasted fresh."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and the 2nd time was to please others who wanted to come.  I'd bestow a straight up 1 star review but I can't be that mean spirited when the place isn't malicious....no actually I can and must be true!!  Paisan's is almost country club-like in that it feels sorta like the people there know you and country club-like in that the food is really really really lackluster--like the reason you're there is to relax not have a good meal.    The pizzas are tolerable--but there's no reason to eat mediocre pizza when you can find it within a mile in any direction sans heading into Lake Monona.  And the pastas taste microwaved and mushy.  That someone wrote they are homemade on here I find shocking.  The sauce too isn't hearty and herbal like an Italian sauce seemingly might be.   \"Allegedly\" the food used to be better which sounds to me like distorted memories fond of the lake view.    Skip this place at all costs, walk over to Ian's or Gino's than go look out on the Terrace on your own."}
{"text":"Awful.  Rude service, 20+ minute wait at the bar, and noisy atmosphere. All for gloppy cheesy mush.  This is not Italian it's  fast food junk.  Run.... Go to Lombardino or Vin Santo."}
{"text":"The location and service is great at Paisan's. I'm not originally from Wisconsin and when I was visiting my boyfriend took me here as a nice fancy lunch date. I was very unimpressed with the food. We dine out a lot in Madison and there's many better places to choose from in the area.  The service was good and our waiter was nice. I was disappointed they would not validate parking so we had to pay. My boyfriend said they've done it in the past but maybe they discontinued it.  I honestly was very disappointed in their \"Italian\" food. Coming from the east coast when I eat Italian food I expect it to be fresh but everything tasted like it came from the freezer!  The prices however are very affordable and I was happy about that at least.  I will go back to Paisan's in the future but I'll keep my expectations low. I really do think they shouldn't call themselves \"Italian\" food if their lasagne came from the freezer."}
{"text":"Five stars for the Pizza, setting, and the quality line of beers.  The best pizza restaurant in Madison.  I've been coming to Paisan's for over 30 years.  The new location is dynamite, the wait staff has always been great, and the pizza is as good as ever."}
{"text":"When I heard that we were going out to an upscale pizza place on vacation, I was very excited. This was a mistake. Apparently, \"upscale pizza place\" means \"overrated loud hipster tomato bar\". I have no idea what all the fuss is about. It takes an hour to get in even WITH reservations, the service is incredibly slow, and I thought the pizza was soggy and weird. (I went here in the summer of 2015. It could have changed since then.) In addition, it's very loud and the seats that you spend hours waiting in are hard and uncomfortable. To be fair, quite a few people enjoy this, hence the extra star. I just don't know why."}
{"text":"We've had better pizza and service at other restaurants in Madison.  For their pizza, their cheese didn't taste good at all which it was very rubbery and very blah for their pizza.  Service, our waitress never checked on us after she delivered our pizza and she didn't offer to refill our drinks unless we asked.  Save your money and go somewheres else."}
{"text":"\"One of Madison's favorites for Thin Crust Pizza...\" I disagree, or would at least like to know who they asked as the pizza was good but was far from \"great\" to make my favorite list.  The price was also a bit expensive for a not so special pizza.  We ordered the \"Bella\" and it was basically a sloppy joe in the shape of a pizza.  If you order it, be ready to use a fork to eat the mess.  The bread was nothing special either...most Italian restaurants give you complimentary bread, and I've had better bread for free. The dressing for the salad was good.  I think for what you get, the food is ok, but they're overcharging and you'll get a better deal and tastier pizza at a chain pizza restaurant.  \"Paisan's also features one of Madison's finest outside dining areas.\" Another statement on Paisan's website that I don't think lives up to what they state, or maybe I just have high standards, or maybe there just aren't any other \"fine\" outside dining areas in Madison. The photos of the patio on the website makes it look like you'll be right on the lake and it would be a peaceful dining experience next to the lake, but you're actually about 20 feet up on the buildings patio and the main street is below so there is a lot of traffic noise.  The lake is across the streets.  A decent view, but I would hope there is better.  Maybe when they state \"one\" of Madison's finest they mean \"one of a hundred\".  There also weren't any umbrellas on the tables, and for an 80 degree sunny day in the Midwest on a concrete patio, we were getting a little cooked.  The service was also \"meh\".  The waiter was friendly, but we were out on a hot patio, got a tiny pitcher of water and never saw the waiter again until we were done eating and sat for about 15 minutes before I finally had to get up to find the waiter to get our check and a box for the remaining pizza.  The little things matter too...if a guest is paying for overpriced pizza at what is supposed to be a \"fine dining restaurant\" and the customer needs a box to take leftovers home, it would be a nice gesture for the server to offer to pack the pizza up...but that's minor.  Maybe it wasn't a perfect day for the restaurant, maybe we didn't order the best thing on the menu, or maybe that's their standard meal, it wasn't horrible, but there is room for improvement, especially for the cost.  I think I was just expecting more because of the way they present the place on their website.  If you're going to claim one of the finest views and Madison's favorite thin crust pizzas, be sure to live up to it.  There are a lot of options in Madison where people could go to a restaurant every day for a year or more without hitting the same one twice.  So I doubt we'll go back.  I'm not saying \"don't go here\", all I'm going to say is if you do go to Paisan's, don't have high expectations and you'll probably enjoy the food and atmosphere more."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I received a salad that the lettuce was black and wilted.  I informed the waitress and she said she'd get the manager. The manager came over said \"I'm so sorry we won't charge you for that.\" And walked away. Never did he offer to replace it or ask if I wanted something in its place. So much for my dinner I guess...... Probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"How can you make Italian food inedible? Well Paisan's did. The manicotti with tomato sauce could hardly be choked down.  Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"This was our first time to this very highly recommended establishment,and I must say this was the WORST DINNER I've had in a long time. Coffee was tepid at best Alfredo sauce tasted as if it were from a jar, wait I've had better from a jar. The cannon filling was very gritty and the chocolate sauce was Hershey from a squeeze bottle and definitely was not with the 55.00 bill. We've had better st olive garden. Don't waste your time or money at this poor restaurant. We will never go back!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Arrived around 4:30pm on a Saturday evening with a group of 8 total. We were told over the phone they do not take reservations, but when we arrived we found out they DO take reservations. Our wait time was only 15mins or so, which isn't bad. We were seated with a beautiful lake view! Had our party not consisted of 3 children we would not have fit into the bench seating.  Our waiter was a nice college aged fellow. No complaints on our service one bit!  The pizza was GREAT and would recommend! They do not scimp on any of the toppings!!  The pasta dishes were very bland. No real flavor. It wasnt BAD, but for an Italian restaurant it was bad..   When our check came we were trying to figure a good tip, but realised they had already added an 18% tip."}
{"text":"I've lived absurdly close to this place for awhile now. I finally tried it and everything was passable. Good, solid Italian food. No gnocchi, which was kind of a downer, but no complaints or rave reviews here. They have really reasonably-priced fixed-price lunch/dinner options, too. And the wait staff were good.   The view of Monona on their terrace thing is really spectacular. If you can get a seat there (or in the indoor sunroom with all the windows), you're in for a long stare at a really nice view.   Nothing about this place stands out as suuuuuper spectacular, but it's good, tasty, well-priced Italian food. Apparently they have good happy hour deals but I wouldn't know."}
{"text":"Was here for a work dinner event.  Service was not good.  Very slow too.  Worst service I've gotten here.  Usually gotten better service."}
{"text":"Awesome view over the lake.. Great service and prices. Come here every time for cross country meets!"}
{"text":"I love pizza but was really disappointed with this place.  We ordered the combination Deluxe pizza w/Italian sausage, mushrooms, mozzarella and hot peppers.  The pizza was pretty bland and tasteless and the hot peppers turned out to be pepperoncini peppers (the yellow sweet/tangy peppers) not hot at all.  And what's with \"Taco Pizza\"?  I saw this on their menu and was completely puzzled and a little grossed out.  Why this combination when there are so many other worthwhile combos??  I've been told it's a mid-western thing.  Mid-western or not, it's just wrong."}
{"text":"I am amazed at the bad reviews that are here!  I have known Paisans, and it's \"sister\" PortaBella, for almost 50 years in 4 locations!  If you love a tasty zesty sandwich, have the GARIBALDI!  If you want a salad, order the LARGE PORTA salad, which I choose to have with \"french bleu\" dressing, which is a rich dark french with blue cheese chunks.  True that it is not \"gourmet\" dining, but it is DAMN GOOD and VERY CONSISTENT!  I like the Mad City Brown Ale, and Spaten Optimizer beers.  They are always COLD!  To my wife and I, Paisans is a destination in and of itself and a \"can't miss\" any time we are in Madison.  If you are reading this as a former UW person who is now afraid to come back here because you are being mis-informed that it has deteriorated - please just come back and decide for yourself.  Order what you remember being EXCELLENT during your time, and you will NOT be disappointed!  Our last time there was last evening 6/08/2013.  The place was CRAWLING with happy customers!  It is not going anywhere.  It will be around for a long time!  The price range shown of $31-$60 per person is way off!  You need a HUGE bar tab for it to be anywhere near that high.  My wife had a Garbaldi and a small porta.  I had a large porta and two large beers.  Our bill - $33.00."}
{"text":"Paisan's Restaurant has a great atmosphere and location with a great view to the lake... When we arrived a Paisans we were seated near the patio area. At first a service started very good but quickly decline when are food took longer than a hour and half almost two hours for one Crispy Pizza it was unbelievable... When our pizza arrived it was one the burned side and server explained that a Crispy pizza takes a long time to cook but it dose not take a Hour and Half!!! Beside the burnt edges it actually tasted good and I enjoyed the pizza... Paisan's will definitely NOT my first pizza place option but I could return..."}
{"text":"I've never had a meal at Paisans, the 5 stars are for Happy Hour only. The only food I've actually tried were the 1$ Happy Hour Fries, though they were tasty.  1$ Gin and Tonics. I heard that and was in heaven."}
{"text":"Had two \"pasta\" dishes last night.  Shrimp pasta and cannoli.  After two full portions of the shrimp i found one tiny almost canned shrimp in the two gluey and disgusting servings,  The cannoli tasted like the inside of a bad Mexican burrito and the cheese seemed like it came out of a giant tube of Acme cheese product.  This is surpassed by any third grade cafeteria school \"Italian\" day.  Revolting.  How do they stay in business?!"}
{"text":"I felt like Bobby De Niro when I visited this place for dinner.  There was a 20 minute wait for a table \"with a view\" so I went to the bar.  Wow.  The bar is a cool round shape with half circle booths around the side.  A large picture window warps the place and behind the bar are several rows of bottles.  Kept waiting for Joe Peschi to walk in and say, \"Hey Spider, how bout a Cutty and water\"  About the time my drink showed up, I was seated in the dining area.  \"With a view\" means you get a table the overlooks the lake.  Really nice.  Josh, my waiter, personable, and attentive.  He did his job well and kept the drinks flowin'.  The menu choices are vast, plenty of Italian staples, sandwiches and pizza.  The food smelled awesome, and won't cost you a \"Goodfellas\" take.  15 bucks on the average will buy you meal large enough for Fat Tony.  I ordered a Gambaldi (sp??) sandwich.  Wow!  I felt like a made man when it came.  Piled higher than the leaning tower of Piza w/ meat, awesome tasting bread and cheese that made my \"mout watta\"  The pizza smelled dam good.  Next time.  What sucked here was the cleanliness of the place.  The floors were dirty w/ spent napkins, crumbs and straw wrappers.  The mirror at the back of the restaurant looked like Ray Charles cleaned it.  More streaked than Ray Stevens.  The bathroom was nasty.  Garbage was overflowing the can, no paper towels.    The food was great.  I'll be back for a slice in the future!"}
{"text":"No happy hour specials on the patio. 9\" Cheese pizza -$11.60. Almost rotten Hopalicious, $5. Potentially rabid squirrelzipping around under your feet - $0.00. No vodka in my first drink- c'mon, really?"}
{"text":"Total bill for one glass of water, very small caesar salad, 9\" pepperoni pizza, and 18% mandatory tip and tax was $19.68. I complained about the tip and the fat manager waddled over and told me they had high tips because they don't pay the wait staff much over $2.00 - I told him that was not my problem. Service was not outstanding, pizza was burned black on bottom, and it was way too salty.  I only had a small caesar and a glass of water.  The service was not that great, the staff did not know if we could have the entire room to ourselves if we did not have 20 people.   Long story short, paisans is a place for college kids to go, but not adults who want a good meal and great service and great food.  I WILL NOT GO BACK TO PISANS AGAIN."}
{"text":"Tasty food at an affordable price.  While the University Square location was pretty key, the new location has great views of Lake Mendota.  Capital beer on tap and good sangria."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow and not very useful...never once asked if we wanted something to drink, just brought water out. Took a hour for a 9\" pizza that didn't even have all the correct toppings on it. Food was \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Paisan's has been our family favorite for more than a decade, right from their earlier location on University Avenue The last few times we felt that the food (esp the pizza) was not upto the standard that we were used to. However the lake view, ambience and service more than made up for the perceived short comings in the food quality. Unfortunately, our most recent experience seems to indicate the the food shortcomings have spread to the service as well. The service we encountered was really sub par. The place was not full and it took almost 10 mts for the waitress to show up and from then it went downhill. Wine glasses not for everyone, very slow, did not even offer us desert. I guess all good things come to an end, sadly."}
{"text":"From the wife: Haven't been here in a while and now that I finally visited, I'm hooked!   We were seated by a friendly host in the room overlooking the lake with the fireplace. So refreshing to 1) see a fireplace turned on for once and 2) be seated near a window in winter and be warm!   Hubby and I got a small pitcher of red sangria, a 6\" pepperoni pizza, and a half seashell pasta and cheese ravioli with meat sauce dinner that came with bread and an enormous Porta salad. It was a lot of drink and food for $40 - plenty to share!   The sangria was flavorful, the bread was warm and soft, the yogurt basil dressing divine, the pepperoni crispy on the edges, and the meat sauce nice and chunky!   There were only slight misses. The waiter was lackluster and soft spoken which was complete opposite of host. He slammed down my salad bowl giving me a bit of a scare. No apology given. The pizza was salty - but can't complain that there was too much pepperoni, right?! The ravioli was just okay, kind of dry. They also no longer have the metal plates - missed that from the past. Didn't get to see if they still have almond joy ice cream because I was too full!  All in all a nice evening! We left stuffed and happy! And wanting to come back!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Paisan's when I was doing jury duty (it is close to the courthouse) and enjoyed it.  The ambiance is great, especially in the summertime.  They have a huge patio for dining alfresco right on the lake.  It also has a cozy feel inside with unique, private booths.    I usually get pizza here and always enjoy it."}
{"text":"This place is not bad at all. The bar is great for people watching and has a view of the street. The dining room with the dark booths is fun for a romantic dinner, the dining room with the large windows and lake view is gorgeous, and the patio is perfect for a sunset meal by the lake. The pasta dishes are smothered in cheese, which people might want to know about ahead of time since it's probably not everyone's preference, and the pizza is just right. You're not getting gourmet food nor should you expect it, but Paisan's is great for comfort food and tasty drinks. I would recommend the sangria. Plus, they offer free underground parking which is a great positive for a downtown location."}
{"text":"Very disappointing! The food is awful to say the least. Atmosphere is wonderful and our server was great. A few of us got the tomato sauce pasta and it was not even edible. We then asked for a side of white sauce to mix in for better flavor. The white sauce tasted like nothing. Very bland. It didn't help the meal at all. We all left hungry and disappointed that a place with a great atmosphere and view would have such terrible food."}
{"text":"Went to Paisan's for lunch before a show at the Overture Center. I have to say, I was not impressed! I think the only thing this place has going for it is the view because there aren't a lot of water views in Madison but you only get a view of the water in a very small portion of the restaurant.   We ordered the spicy cheese bread to start, that was the best part of the meal. Everyone also ordered a salad to go along with our pizza. I got a vegetable salad. The description says iceberg and romaine lettuce. I only had iceberg in my bowl and huge chunks of it at that. Plus the Italian dressing had absolutely no taste to it. For our main entrees we got a taco pizza and a super hot pizza. The super hot pizza at least had a little flavor to it. The taco was not good. Just a bunch of iceberg lettuce on top of seasoned beef."}
{"text":"I recently went here for my Birthday dinner, and I was not impressed. Our server was not personable what so ever (she seemed like she could care less) and she also took an extremely long time to bring drinks, and take orders. The food was bland and to be honest, I could have probably made tastier frozen from a box Italian food. Pretty disappointed and would not recommend this place to anyone else...especially for an event dinner.  Oh, one more thing...their music selection was terrible! We seriously were baffled as to why a restaurant like this would be playing songs like \"Baby Got Back\" and \"Ice Ice Baby\" on a Saturday night for dinner. I am in my 20's and not uptight, but c'mon, there is a time and a place."}
{"text":"After years of missing out, we finally got try the pizza at Paisan's.   We came on Saturday night with a party of 9 (5kids) without a reservation and they were more than accommodating.   So the service is great.  The pizza wasn't anything grebut it was ok.  The crust did have a cook crunch and the toppings were a plenty."}
{"text":"The bar was okay (satisfactory drink menu), but the dining room made me feel like I was in a coffin.  I had a pizza and a salad, both of which did the job in satiating my hunger, but neither of which I'd write home about.  In fact, I don't think I'd take my parents here, and they love mediocre dining.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"i have mixed thoughts on this place.  i liked the handmade pasta.  in fact, i loved the handmade pasta.  i'm kind of picky about my pasta.  it's a change of pace from the boxed variety that you have every day and is so easy to come by.  however, there wasn't much variety on the number of sauces to pick from.  i ended up getting the meat sauce -- which, although i enjoyed it, had some sort of overpowering flavor that i just can't put my finger on.  my sig o had rotini noodles with alfredo sauce (the only non-tomato based sauce) and mushrooms.  while heavy on the mushrooms (yay for him!), he said he felt like he could've made it at home.  the view i think would've been nice at sunset or during the day, but seeing as it was winter and the sun set before 6, we did not get to enjoy it.  instead, we viewed only the sad flowers killed by cold weather.  the waitress was very attentive and nice.  she was very pleasant and helpful when we had questions and even though she dropped our cheesy bread (which was, mmmm! delicious straight out of the oven!), she brought us a second one lickity-split!  the special on monday is the handmade pasta so we got a good deal for our food.  plus, for just a couple dollars extra it can be all-you-can-eat which would be a stellar deal if you can eat a lot.  i'm giving it three stars: 1 for handmade pasta (mmm!) 1 for attentive and pleasant service, and 1 for the delicious cheesy-bread and the fact that i thought my food was good  it doesn't get the last two stars 'cuz the menu wasn't super varietive (not a word..sorry) and we didn't get to see the view."}
{"text":"The worse smoked turkey sandwich, even probably Subway has a better turkey sandwich, the sandwich had brown lattice, onions seem like2 days old. Worse taste in my life for a sandwich! The service was slow and understaffed. It was my first time eating at this place and definitely my last time too!! Pretty lame experience, for the location and the view they have. They can have great potential!! Too bad! And the worse part is eating there for Mother's Day!! I wish I can give them 0 Stars!"}
{"text":"Paisan's has been around  along time at different locations. You can't go wrong with a porta- salad and a whitehouse sandwich, nice outdoor seating when weather permits.Try there ice cream booze drinks!"}
{"text":"Great italian food.  My favorite was the half cannelloni, half manicotti plate with red sauce and a splash of alfredo.  Not on the menu, yes I was that difficult.  Great rustic setting too."}
{"text":"We had a nice meal here in Sept.  We were able to sit out on the terrace to view the lake.  Service was great and the food very tasty.  Great pizza place!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this is not good Italian food. Burnt pizza and canned sauce is not my idea of good Italian cooking. The service is weird, tons of high school and college students running around with no food service skills. I think this place is only still open because it caters to UW alumni who come into town looking for a taste of the past... a bad taste from the past. Save your money, Skip the old stand by and look for something better..."}
{"text":"I am shocked....just shocked that Paisans only has 3 stars on Yelp.   Now reading through  the reviews I see a lot of people complaining about he wait time to get in, the slow service, the rude service, and the fact that they do a traditional pizza and not that froo froo fancy horse crap that many of the snobby typical Madison douchy places serve.     Well I will say this...you are spot on about the service....it is slow and the people who work the front are rude (the servers I have never had an issue with) and it does take forever to get in unless you show up early.  BUT...never in a million years would I call their pizza and food not delicious.   IMO...and that is the reason we have Yelp...Paisans is pretty close to the best Pizza in madison and the spicy cheese bread.....holy lord.  lets just say the garlic cheese brad is like crack on plate....and no I have never done crack.  Normally I dock a star or two because of the service but I cannot here because the pizza is just too good.   Lots of toppings, cheese, nice flaky crust, the chopped onion sauce...seriously I feel like making a trip this afternoon now. It is real tasty and traditional pizza...that is what I like if you cannot tell by my reviews.    Oh...and the views are good too but lets get back to the delicious and orgasmic spicy cheese bread.   You know when you cut into it and your wife takes the middle forcing you to eat the end pieces....it is still delicious.    And then you slowly dunk it into the....ok...you get it.  Anyway, my recommendation for Paisans would be to start taking some reservations and maybe have your staff at the front smile a bit.  Other than that....the food is perfect and if you are stuck waiting...you can always order pizza at the bar."}
{"text":"I will just start by saying that the employees are nice and fairly accommodating.  I work in the building and they are super cool about me dropping in to grab a bottle of water, or borrow a salt shaker for a day.  That being said, their turn-over rate is frequent, and once someone gets hired in, trained in, and experienced enough to do their job well, they're gone.    As I previously stated, I work in the building.  I have obviously given this place a ton of opportunities.  The only thing I find to be consistent is the chili (but it's seasonal).  A lot of people rave about their pizza, but considering this is Madison, and there is no shortage of amazing pizza places, I would pass on this place.  The ingredients are not on par with the Madison standard, and the crust is burnt.  Like every single time.  Same with the garlic bread and cheese bread.  Ingredient-wise, my confidence is not inspired.  I called once and requested to build my own pizza.  I asked if they could throw together a Margherita Pizza (Red sauce, mozz, fresh basil, tomato).  I was really taken aback when the person taking my order said they literally didn't have the right ingredients for it..... (Let that sink in..  An Italian place that doesn't keep fresh basil and sliced tomato stocked...)     The soup is not homemade - which is pretty noticeable by anyone who cooks - with the exception of the chili (you can tell the chili is homemade because it is slightly different each time - still good! but different).  I tried the chicken tenders once because I figured it was REAL hard to screw that up.  I was wrong.  The pasta is alright if you stick with basics.  Spaghetti, meat sauce, some mozzarella... you get the picture.  Personally I wasn't a fan of the lasagna either.    Like I said, and I think it shows, I've given this place a lot of chances... but if I didn't work in the building I would have given up ages ago.    A saving grace of this place is I do really love their patio to enjoy a glass of wine after work and enjoy the sunshine."}
{"text":"I  love going here. I go there a lot for family gatherings. My mom used to work there when she was younger and she knows the owner. We always get great service when we go there. My favorite thing to eat on the menu is the Portobello salad it's the best."}
{"text":"Paisan's exterior, overlooking Lake Monona, may look romantic. But do not be fooled, dear readers. The interior lacks charm, and has sort of a generic, hotel-ish quality, besides maybe the cool, pine wood shelving that enables those at the bar to tell exactly what the offerings of alcohol are. This is a nice, clear lay-out as opposed to the standard clustering of bottles.     However, I was a-okay with the food. It's good, stick to your ribs type of stuff. I had the beef noodle soup and it was perfect to warm me up on a winter day. I also enjoyed the spinach fettucini with chicken tettrazini in a light, yet not doused white cheese sauce. The college-aged guy that served us was pleasant and attentive enough.  One thing that could be improved though definitely are the plates. They reminded me of, like, old-school airplane ones with the silver lining. A little bit of the pasta was also burnt and crunchy...like cooked too much in an oven or something?   I would return because in comparison to the other Madison offerings, it's a little better than average. It's more like three and a half stars."}
{"text":"went to eat here w/ my date for the night. we weren't looking for anything fancy nor were we looking for any chain restaurant. Italian food sounded good and the short walk from our hotel sounded even better.   a few feet away from the restaurant you could smell the food and it smelled AMAZING! so we thought we made the RIGHT decision to come here.   not so much  we were seated right away and the service was mediocre, we probably should have waited for lake view seating. someone described the booths as hotel like and i gotta agree with that. very cold and uninviting area we sat in. all wood like we were in someone's basement.   then we ordered the food. i don't remember the name of what i ordered but it was like an italian enchilada. it was ok. nothing to brag about. my date had some seafood pasta concoction. it actually said on the menu it was made with imitation crab. . . .  .IMITATION CRAB!!?? i mean, i love truth in advertising but i was a little surprised to see that they'd use imitation crab. she said it tasted like crab but still. shock factor 10.   overall i'd say you could probably find a better italian restaurant to go to. their pizzas look like they get alot of praise and maybe i'll do that next time i'm in town but honestly, if you can't make a good pizza, you might want to stay out of the restaurant biz."}
{"text":"The service was great. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. The food was pretty good. My mom and I split a pizza that was half sausage and green olives half Bella, one of their specialty pizzas. The crust was great and I loved the sausage and olives. I didn't care for the Bella, it was too sweet for me, but my mom enjoyed it. The tiramisu was okay but I would definitely not order it again. They have an amazing view and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We came in for drinks late in the evening on a Tuesday. The hostess had a major attitude about seating us outside if we weren't eating. She even slapped the menu down on the table and stormed off. Then the waiter came over and said that we were 'technically' not supposed to order drinks without food, but he would help us anyways. There were literally 20 table open outside. My sangria was fine, but I was so put off I didn't even enjoy it."}
{"text":"7/1/13 My wife and I biked downtown.  If you want a great view of lake Monona then check out Paisan's patio.  It's all about the view!  The pizza, salad, and garlic bread were okay.  I'd suggest steering clear of their sponge tiramisu."}
{"text":"The first impression you get when you walk into Paisan's is how well-done the restaurant itself is. Paisan's is huge, and is full of hardwood floors and walls, private walled-in booths, and tables with lake views. There's an outdoor patio and a bar that are nearly unrivaled in beauty by any other Madison restaurant.  All the over-the-top fanciness lead me to believe I was going to be paying far more than I could afford for a meal here when I walked in. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that even the most expensive meal here would only run you somewhere in the range of $20 per person.  After deliberating over a menu comprised of your standard Italian fare, I decided to have the manicotti with cheese sauce. When this plate was brought out to me, I wasn't expecting much. The dish was much smaller than usual, and the masses of cheese didn't look like they were going to get along too well with my stomach. But as soon as I took my first bite, I realized my eyes were completely deceiving me.  For one, the dish was the perfect size because all that cheese and pasta is extremely filling. And every bite was extremely flavorful, thanks to the quality and variety of cheeses they chose to put into the dish. Normally putting this much cheese on one dish results in a plain blob of cheese with no real taste, whereas with this I was able to taste the many different flavors of cheese swirling around together to form a very harmonious dish. Paisan's really lived up to the expectations of Wisconsin cheese in this regard.  I was very fortunate to ask for the cheese sauce on top rather than the marinara, however. I ordered a side of marinara for dipping the manicotti into, and was horrified at how bitter and spice-less it tasted. Had that marinara been covering my dish rather than the melted cheese, the whole thing would have been inedible.  We also ordered an expensive mixed drink called \"Purple Haze,\" which actually tasted like it was worth what it cost. It was a perfect ratio of alcohol to mixers that allows it to give a strong kick when you  first taste it, without being overpowering after that. The drink ended with a sweet and refreshing aftertaste of fresh pineapple.   I get the impression that depending on what you order, the food here will either amaze or disgust you. I was very satisfied with what I got. And above all that, Paisan's atmosphere makes it an excellent place to take a date or family for a fancy and affordable dinner."}
{"text":"We had the worse bartender, I've ever had, on Saturday afternoon. He saw us come in, walked into the kitchen, then didn't come out for another 5 minutes. He served a table behind us. Keep In mind, we were the only people in the whole bar area. Walks back into the bar, without even glancing at us of, maybe , just say , \"hi\", \" I'll be right with you\"... Nothing. Than, finally walks up to the person( in our group) that just came in, after us 3. He sais\" what do you want?\" No smile not the least bit friendly. A friend of mine paid for our round of drinks and gave him a dollar, when I wouldn't have given him nothing. Thankfully we had a nice server at the table. I just hope that anyone in charge would AT LEAST talk with this  bartender on how, not to be socially awkward, considering his job! This was my 3rd and last visit!"}
{"text":"We'd heard great things about Paisan's and the pizza did not disappoint. Crispy, thin crust which is always my favorite. Intense, delicious red sauce, full of herbs, tomatoes, bustling flavors. Ours was topped with sliced onions, banana peppers, sausage, and pepperoni. We went with the spicy cheese blend and it was velvety smooth and melded well with everything else. It was truly delicious and we devoured every bite.   We also ordered the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer. These did not compare well with the pizza. The coating tasted burnt and yet the insides were slightly cold and not molten at all. The marina sauce for dipping was delicious. Chunks of tomatoes and peppers, loaded with oregano - very tasty.  The restaurant is much larger than you would expect while driving up. It covers the majority of the ground floor. There are myriad rooms. Lots of dark wood benches. Where we sat, it definitely felt dark and enclosed.  The service was fine. They greeted us when we came in. Had us sit and the bar until a table was available. Picked us up from the bar and ushered us to our table. Took our order and delivered our food. Nothing wrong, nothing extra. Just the minimum to get the job done w/out doing anything wrong.  Besides the mozzarella sticks, my only complaint was the prices. It is very good pizza and you are paying for it. We waited at the bar before being seated and noticed those same mozzarella sticks are half price there. At more than $1 for stick, I'd definitely prefer to sit in the bar area. Beers were also much more expensive than I expected, but again I see they have a happy hour special which would have been much more reasonable for pizza and beer. When we go again, we'll definitely do that instead."}
{"text":"Paisan's embodies the joie de vivre of its place among the culture of learning, gastronomy, government, and beer.  It may be more memorable than the Der Rathskeller in the student union or a walk across the frozen solid Lake Mendota."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I've been going to Paisan's since i was about 10 years old.  The best is a Porta Salad and then going on to the Bella Pizza with onion's!  BEST PIZZA I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Paisan's was a surprise to me. I had no idea it existed, but it seems I may be one of the only people to know so. It was busy, not crowded at all, but not desolate either.   The atmosphere was very nice. Friendly staff and not too bright lighting. The seating that we had (booth) was a little uncomfortable and the only reason I am not giving it a 5-star. It seemed like the booths were really far from the table so you had to sit at the edge of your seat.  Prices were very reasonable. We hit up the dinner special of homemade pasta which I believe came in at about 6.50 and for 2 or 3 dollars more, it would have been all you can eat. The single portion I had was enough to fill me up and I typically eat quite a bit.  As for the food, I had a mushroom alfredo sauce over rotini. It was delicious. There were many (almost too many, but just almost) mushrooms, but since I like them a lot, it worked.  I also ordered the spicy cheese bread as an appetizer which was very good, but tasted bland after it got cold. They had a decent beer selection, I had spotted cow, which is always good."}
{"text":"My wife love this place, it has been around for ever. Even though it has moved a couple of times since the 70's. I find the food over all to be cheap knockoff of Italian food but the true bright spot is the Shrimp pizza and their porta salads. If I rated this just on those two items it would be a 5 star rating. If you stray to other Italian fair I would give it a 2 star."}
{"text":"Get a porta salad, super hot pizza, and garibaldi sandwich. The happy hour in the bar is super cheap!"}
{"text":"I was here a couple years ago with my family because my sister recommended it. It was packed and it took us an hour before we could get a table. We also waited an hour for our pizza. While we were waiting, two servers bumped into each other and dropped two trays worth of entrees and glasses. I felt bad for whoever wasn't getting their food there. When we finally got the pizza, it was very dissapointing and soggy. I would give this place negative stars if I could. Avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"***ABOVE AVERAGE PIZZA RESTAURANT WITH A VIEW***  If it weren't for the view, this restaurant would not have nearly as many reviews on Yelp.   I have been here several times since 2004.  I agree with the other reviews about how it's amazing this restaurant has been somehow voted best pizza in Madison.    I've tried the lasagna and the ravioli dishes as well, and there is nothing special about them.  The value is lacking, too.  For $12-$15, you would expect more quality or at the least larger portions.  If you come here, you will reach the inevitable conclusion that the view of Lake Mendota saves this restaurant.    The happy hour is the one major plus: $1 well drinks, $3.5 wines, and $2 beers."}
{"text":"The view was the only thing that made this worth the wait.  Recently myself and a group of friends visited Paisan's for a Friday night dinner.  Great company, good view but I left feeling I could have gotten a better Italian meal at Olive Garden.    First, I had the Porta salad and ordered it with Italian dressing.  One look at the dressing and I knew I should have made a different choice.  The Italian dressing was  straight olive oil with no flavor at all.  Luckily before dumping it on my salad I tasted it and quickly asked for Cesar dressing instead.  For an entree, I ordered the homemade spinach pasta with pepper an onion sauce and Italian sausage.  It was so-so and under seasoned.  The sausage wasn't really anything to write home about either.  It was a step above Johnsonville, but not by much.  The view over Lake Monona is great and the service was above average, but unfortunately when someone mentions going to Paisan's again I am going to head somewhere else."}
{"text":"There is no place in Madison that has as much history with me as Paisan's.  Years (like lots, and lots of years) ago in high school we would eat there after our state forensics meets - we drove 4 hours from Northern WI to get to Madison, and this was the highlight of our trip (well, that and getting to stay in a hotel without our parents, score!).  In college we went to their University Square location after every concert and recital because it was a short walk across the street from the Humanities building.  My roommate used to use her fake ID to buy their sangria. Once, I even went to eat just in the hopes of catching glimpse at the guy I was crushing on (now my husband) who was there with a friend that night. Paisan's has history for me.  I don't love their new location as much as the old.  Even with the transported booths, it doesn't have the character as the original, but they tried. I've had amazing servers and so-so servers.  All of that aside...what I love about Paisan's is their consistency.  Their manicotti remains in my top 5 foods of all time...because it NEVER changes.  It's always served in the same plates, the same way, with an olive on top. The sangria. The mozzarella cheese bread. The porta salad.  It's all exactly the same as it was when I was a fresh-faced 15 year old, excited to be in Madison for the first time. To some people this might be frustrating, but to me, it's nostalgic and perfect.  No, Paisan's may not be the very best Italian food you can get in the Madison area. But it's good - and will always be one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Blah -- overpriced and bland selection of entries that may upset your stomach, which was enveloped with slow service...  My wife and I recently  went out to dinner at Paisan's. It is conveniently located near the Monona Terrace and features an attractive combination of traditional charm with magnificent lake views (outdoor seating).  We ordered the seafood tetrazzini and lasagna. For $14, you get bread and soup or salad and a cheese-spiked rip off. On their menu, they indicated that there would be more than shrimp shrapnel, but that is what we were left with (outside a legion of underwhelming whitefish and cheap scallop pieces). The flavor was bland and unappealing. There was just a mantle of broiled cheese applied so thick, it was a mozzy disaster. Sadly, I had 15 times the shrimp and flavor from the Lean Cuisine I had for lunch. Their lasagna was nearly as poor.   It was drowned in sauce. When spending time to shovel through the sauce to get to the chunk of lasagna, it was poorly seasoned meat, pasta and cheese concoction. Since I only sampled the tetrazzini, this is what I believe that made for a foul stomach a couple hours later.  The food would have been sent back, but their overall quality and a Hell's Kitchen waiting time (over an hour) resigned me to the fact that more precious time should not be wasted for marginal improvement.   What bothers me is that this joint is getting business left and right by folks led to believe that this eatery serves supreme Italian when you are getting slop. I did not try their self-heralded pizza. They use cheap, low quality ingredients ... they tried to hide it in their entrees, but it would be as obvious with their pies (based on sight and review of their menu).   Paisan's is basing their experience on location, smartly orchestrated ambiance and those ignorant of quality Italian food. Take your cash to a restaurant that gives a damn and visit the beach independent of this made-up dive."}
{"text":"Paisan's is pretty, inside is older and dark but the view of Lake Monona is superb. The wait staff and hostess are nice. The only complaint I have are about how price-to- portion is, yet I see this as a \"date night\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a delicious pizza loaded with topping. Usually don't like thin crust but this was very good. Had a small veg salad that was very good. Fresh with plenty of veggies. $6.50 was a little much but don't mind paying for fresh ample ingredience. The service was great, friendly, personable waiter. The view was great. We sat in a roomy booth with a lake view!!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Just awful!!!!  Bland salad dressing and \"cheese\" sauce that tastes like paste because the white sauce was not cooked properly!!!! When I told the manager about the paste like sauce he basically told me I was just not used to their sauce. Are you serious!, I have a background in culinary arts, I know when flour is not cooked out of a roux properly!!! Then they said any salad was included with the special and then charges us 3.50 a piece for bland salad!!! We will NEVER be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really nice restaurant, I'm bummed to not be able to give the full 5 stars.  We went for restaurant week - had never been here before. The menu looked great! My wife's entree was awesome, pasta with carmelized cheese over the top. Really good experience.  I opted for a personal pizza... and it wasn't awesome. It was on like the leading edge of OK. The tiramisu after dinner really looked great, except that it must have been sitting to near to the cooling unit in the fridge, and the top of the cake had frozen hard (you know, how it feels to bite a popsickle, sort of). So that part of dinner was also not awesome.  I really want to love this restaurant - the building is great, the view is phenomenal, and every staff member was kind and inviting. Our dinner just had too many misses for $60!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Killer porta salad. Thanks Dennis and Mahrie for the meal!"}
{"text":"Paisan's has moved to a new location. 131 West Wilson - close to the Monona Terrace. I will miss the old location, but this new one is quite great too. Great view of the lake - bigger and better outside patio - plus they now have a bar as well. Very similar atmosphere as the old place and same great food. Parking underneath the building as well - which is great."}
{"text":"Great view and nice environment, but food is ready overrated. The food was at best mediocre..we ordered a pizza to share which was okay... And pasta that wasn't  very good at all..."}
{"text":"I have been to Paisan's in person on two occasions and got exactly what I came for each time.   1. HAPPY HOUR! Paisan's has happy hour specials that include good prices on generous portions of bar type food as well as good drink specials (Long Islands!). Our group had a great time, and experienced excellent service.   2. Late night after Live on King Street we sat on the patio overlooking Lake Monona. The view was amazing! My dining partner and I enjoyed taps and apps. Again, great service.    Additionally:  I have eaten Paisan's pizza on other occasions when a friend has picked up takeout and brought it to the bar. It is always a welcome sight and quickly devoured.   Finally, they have pitchers of House Sangria. I have never tried it, but it's next on the list! :)"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst Italian I've ever eaten.  Climb into your wayback machine and this place pops up.  Dark pleather booths and clunky captains chairs, plastic water tumblers and cheap flatware... you get the idea.  Don't get me wrong, I love a good dive, but this was upscale downscale dining at its Italian worst.  The menu is OK if you're 300 lbs and haven't left 1972 (or you are 5), but if you have graduated from iceberg lettuce salads with baby croutons and white opaque dressing, and your idea of pizza involves cheese with a name other than \"cheese,\" steer clear.  Even the pasta was bad.  My 7 year old took a bite and said, \"mom, this tastes like oatmeal a little\" (referring to the mushy noodles)\"  We won't be back, but I have to give proper credit to the young UW server who took one look at us and steered us toward the more palatable items on the menu.  We left a lot of food behind but a big tip."}
{"text":"Both Paisans and their sister restaurant downtown used to be our favorite! The food was amazing and the staff was responsive and on point. Paisans has such an amazing location it's a shame that the food and service has become so awful.  Over the last two years we've been there several times, the quality of food and service have fallen substantially.   One of the times our friend ordered a pizza that she returned because it came with a full can (including olive water) of black olives just dumped on top. It was disgusting. In that same dining experience I had lasagna that was obviously microwaved due to the recognizable cheese burn and frozen middle. My girlfriend had one of their dishes that was also cold in the middle as well.  The last time we dined their I got my favorite spicy pizza which they always seem to get right and tastes amazing. That being said, it's probably one of the easiest things on the menu. My girlfriend had one of their red sauce pasta dishes and it was definitely nothing special. The service over the past two years has steadily gone downhill. We've had experiences such as wait staff coming up to our table while texting on their phone, then massively oversharing personal stories, and pouring water into our cocktail glass (twice). This most recent time was probably the worst as it took us going up to another waiter and asking for our bill after waiting for 20 minutes. While we were waiting at our table we could see our waiter outside on the patio wearing his aviator sunglasses just chatting away with another server and then wondering around seemingly doing nothing but looking busy. He then proceeded to disappear into the back kitchen area.  Lastly, what is up with the beer stein display?! We've always wondered what an Italian restaurant is doing with a large chained/locked display of German beer steins.  I did read some reviews about the underground parking being dilapidated. I actually work several floors above Paisans and have to use the same garage. The garage is owned by the property owner and not Paisans. The owner has said he is about the put a lot of money into fixing it up but I hope people don't make a judgement on the restaurant based off of the garage conditions which are out of their control."}
{"text":"We have a business dinner here. The food was alright. We ordered a bunch of pizzas for the table. Way too many raw onions and black olives - but the sausage and crust were pretty good."}
{"text":"Paisan's isn't \"fine dining\"... but its a \"mighty fine\" place to dine.  You may not be 'wowed' by Paisans food, but I don't think you'll be disappointed either.  The Porta salad with chunks of cheese, garbanzo beans, and salami, remains one of my favorite salads in all of Madison.  In fact, you can purchase it in some Madison-area deli's.  The pizza has a thin crust and plenty of flavor.   The sourdough bread is warm and tasty. The spicy cheese bread is delicious.  If you like seafood, try the seafood tetrazini. More into pasta? Try their half and half ravioli combo.  Looking for a sandwich? Try the Garibaldi.   ALWAYS order an affordable pitcher of red or white sangria with your meal and/or while you wait for a table.  It's a great place for a casual date or for dining in large groups. There are lots of semi private nooks and crannies to sit. They provide classic Italian food in a casual environment at an affordable price. In this way, its true to its roots: The restaurant used to be located on campus, but relocated decades to make way for new campus construction."}
{"text":"Had a rough experience with good food.  We were sat immediately however our server took 7 minutes or more to help us.  The manager did pay for one drink but the final issue came when instead of Three Meat Cannelloni and Manicotti, we received two Cannelloni's.  Unfortunately we didn't notice until half way through our twos meals.  Check was right, order was not.  AND THEN, waitress orders turtle dessert correctly but kitchen sent out a peanut butter.  I'm happy neither of us were allergic.    Also with about a third of the restaurant empty they made a statement from management to employees loud enough we heard, \"we are going on a 20-25 minute wait to catch up.\"   Dinner tasted great and so did dessert, but sad to say the service left you less than interested in a return."}
{"text":"The location is pretty sweet with some nice views of lake Monona. The interior is nostalgic w/ lots of wood, but not great.  The food is where they fall short. The menu is really boring: the appetizer selection is sparse and the pizza list is disappointing. I would put some time into that if I ran the place. The pizza was okay- fairly generic; nothing to write home about.  I have to say the tiramisu was pretty good. And they charge $.10 for andes mints! The nerve...  Update: (drinks and more) (1) Word has it they have a $1 happy hour from 4-6 M-Th. I might have to move in. (2) Drank there and they were pretty good - nothing to write home about, but don't shy away if you are in the area. (3) Also, I got to meet the owner - nice guy, but he insists the menu is in good shape. I guess it gets packed during UW games- so I could be wrong."}
{"text":"We've been going to Paisans regularly since 1985.  Very consistent menu and food.  Porta salad is always top notch.  Pasta dishes are terrific.  Absolutely recommend this long time Madison restaurant.  They DO get busy on game nights, but they work hard to maintain service.  Never, ever have we NOT loved the food."}
{"text":"Great, especially for outdoor dining when it is warm out.  They have a cute little courtyard.  The food is always good, but nothing extraordinary.  I would chose Porta Bella over it any day, but I still have a special place in my heart for it. 3 stars."}
{"text":"The service and location of this place was nice, but the food was nothing to write home about. I tried the garlic bread, mozzarella and lasagna for dinner and was underwhelmed. That's not to say the food was bad, but to me the food was just eh. The biggest perks of here were the lake views/ability to sit outside and the pricing not being too high.   I wouldn't be opposed to going back, but this is not a place is necessarily suggest if I were talking with friends."}
{"text":"Big bummer when they moved from the incredibly unique and fun University Square location.    Since then, I've never been able to get a spot overlooking Lake Monona, so I can't comment on how that would add to the experience.  But wow- I hope it adds something because the food is so marginal. Order a standard meal- fettucini alfredo, MAYBE- or pizza, otherwise be prepared to be overloaded with grease and cheese.  I ordered the manacotti once and it was, quite literally, half a block of mozzarella cheese inside three pasta tubes, covered with the other half of the block of cheese....  Just don't be adventurous and I'm sure you'll be fine.  For everything else, go to Portabella.  Revision: I just discovered the biggest draw possible for this place- incredible, yet hidden, happy hour! 4-7pm, Monday thru Friday, $2 rails, $3 Long Islands (so big, so strong), $1 fries, $2 onion rings, $3 jalapeno poppers, AND outdoor seating that is always available.  The atmosphere is stuffy and a bit sterile, but for a deal like that it shouldn't even matter."}
{"text":"Paisan's gets 3 stars for the food, plus one more for the atmosphere and the beer list.  Hearty Italian favorites, slightly on the bland side. The food is decent, nothing special but not bad either. If you feel like carbing out, get the spicy cheese bread -- just like Mom used to make it under the broiler. The texture of the pizzas is great (crust slightly crispy, toppings slightly juicy), but again, it's bland.  They have about 8 local brews on tap. Can't argue with that!  Gorgeous lakeside location with one swanky dining room that has a fireplace. Bar area has windows in the round. The main dining room has wood-paneled booths transferred here wholesale from the previous location -- that takes some effort. But the neon sign on the outside, on the side the faces the lake, has been broken for ages. What's up with that?"}
{"text":"They did a nice job accommodating a single person into the bar for dinner.  Normally just a limited menu in the bar but I was able to order off the full menu. The Parma salad was excellent!! And Raviollis was good also, along with warm bread. Yum! Price was reasonable & they validate parking!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to say Paisan's seems to have gone downhill since it moved.  The old location in the now-destroyed University Square was cozy with a weird romantic charm; I have a lot of nice date memories of that place.  The new restaurant is pretty bland inside, and the pasta was horribly overcooked the one time we went.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Fantastic view with pretty good food. Lasagna was well constructed, sauce was average. Manicotti filling was good, pasta was a little underdone. The service was really good and our food didn't take long to be served. Generally this was a good experience."}
{"text":"Food was just okay - great old wood and leather furnishings.  Heavy on the butter."}
{"text":"Very mediocre food (tried some of the lunch specials & pizza) but nice bread basket, friendly service and wonderful lake view (indoor & outdoor seating), so I'll return! Parking is $2/hour underground."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic night at Paisans last Friday. The food was good, weather was beautiful so we could sit outside and enjoy the lake view. Wait staff was extremely gracious. Definitely a place to visit again and again!  I always look for flavor, I ordered Chicken Parmesan sandwich, it was ok but definitely could use more flavor and spices! Sp 3 stars for the food and 1 for the ambiance!"}
{"text":"It's a good thing we were with great company because then the whole experience would've been an even bigger let down than it was.   First off, patio seating overlooking Lake Monona was beautiful. The weather was nice and mildly breezy so it was a perfect setup for double date night....or so you'd think.  Service was a disaster. It stood out more than the food. Not sure what exactly was going on, but I'm pretty positive it shouldn't take 40 minutes to get a side salad. Yes, 40 MINUTES. Was that the kitchen's fault? Who knows. Was it the server's fault? Ummm....he didn't check on us, so I'll say yes. It seemed our server disappeared to all areas of the restaurant and forgot about us. Don't they usually have sections? There were about 4 other servers we saw taking care of tables right next to us.   An hour after being seated, lo and behold our meals finally made it. Was it worth the wait? Eh.  Pretty sure a Caesar salad doesn't have a 1/4 of a hardboiled egg, giant olives, and cherry tomatoes. PRETTY SURE. And if they accidentally gave me an egg, at least give me the whole egg.  Didn't try the Porta salad, but friends and bf said it was good.  The Garibaldi sandwich, which is apparently a staple of this place, was pretty good. The banana peppers were my favorite part. If the menu is too much to choose from for a first timer, go with the sandwich.   We also had the turkey club sandwich. Not exceptional, but the mustard-mayo was tasty. My bf stated: \"Nothing to write home about.\"  Our friends ordered the Whitehouse, which was an open faced sandwich of some sort....the bread was completely covered in sauce and whatever was supposed to be on the bread, and the Cannelloni. They said it was \"not bad.\"  The sangria saved the night. Not because it was \"oh my god, this is so delicious\" but because it calmed our nerves enough to not get riled about getting our food for so long.    Maybe it was a bad night, service wise. Maybe we'll come back some other time. Maybe."}
{"text":"Their spicy cheese pizza must be had!"}
{"text":"Met a couple friends here for my first taste of Paisan's, and I liked the atmosphere and the food.  We were seated by the windows overlooking lake Monona, and right next to the roaring fireplace.  I ordered the cannelloni stuffed full with cheese and covered in tomato sauce.    They don't serve their lunch menu on the weekends... but their waiter was good, and I had no complaints about my meal.    I would certainly check out Paisan's again, possibly the pizza they are known for next time."}
{"text":"Paisan's menu is pretty limited and pretty old school. They have a beautiful view of the lake once you're in the dining room but the parking garage looks like it's about to fall apart. The food did taste good and the service was very nice (but at 2pm on a Thursday we were the only people in one of the many empty dining rooms). I'd try somewhere else first :-/"}
{"text":"The food was less-great than anticipated.  It was not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but I expected better.  The pitcher of sangria, though?  Awesome.  Truly excellent.  The little wood booths were cute and gave the impression of being secluded, which was nice for a date night.  :)"}
{"text":"My parents used to go to the original location on dates, and brought us to the University Square location as kids.  We mainly got pizza, but what made an impression even as a child was the Garibaldi.  I'd only been to the current location once before, shortly after it opened, and my date and I made the mistake of ordering pasta.  The other reviews arent joking:  steer clear from pasta and traditional (American) Italian classics.  This is not the place.  I vowed not to go back after that experience.  I understand and respect keeping the menu the same after so many decades, and I bet people that grew up on these dishes are overjoyed that they can still get them.  Since I grew up on the pizza and sandwiches . . . didnt work for me.  If you havent had Paisan's pasta before, dont start now.  Recently I got the strongest craving for a Garibaldi.  I used to be able to get them from Delitalia, a long closed sister restaurant, and Deli Roma, an unaffiliated restaurant that ripped off their trademarked sandwich and made a FAR better version of it.  But alas they are also closed, so I decided to give Paisan's another shot.  Garibaldi is still a Garibaldi and as far as I can tell, this is the only remaining place you can get one by any name.  Gino's, Fraboni's, you cant introduce a Gandolfini or something?  I also tried the renowned Porta salad.  For the price, I expected a more substantial sandwich, either in size or quality.  It was excellent but did not seem like an almost $10 sandwich.  The same with the $10.50 portion of the Porta.  I will continue to go back unless we start making Garibaldi's at home or some place more convenient starts offering them.    3 stars for the food quality, the 4th is for being the only place to have the Garibaldi.  Have I said Garibaldi enough? Garibaldi Garibaldi Garibaldi Garibaldi.  Man I wish when there were multiple places all over Madison you could get them.  Garibaldi Garibaldi Garibaldi.  If you're not from here you might not understand.  Oh, I want to add, I only got takeout, but the service was excellent.  They had gotten part of my order wrong and charged me for something less, and they corrected it without upcharging me.  The woman who appeared to be the manager was very friendly and helpful.  My food was ready quicker than expected.  Garibaldi Garibaldi Garibaldi Garibaldi.  Garibaldi Garibaldi Garibaldi Garibaldi."}
{"text":"I had the shells with red sauce and meatballs it was very good! I would come back for more. This restaurant was huge good for me parties."}
{"text":"Paisan's has basically gone into the toilet.   Sad but true.   They have a nice location now (arguably better than the old one) and the interior is rather pleasant.   But I still miss the darker setting and the booths.   Wonderful times and memories from back then.   But the food has gone downhill.   Not sure how it can go this bad but it has.     A while back went there and a party with us ordered ravioli since he hadn't had it in a long time and it was inedible.  He said nothing at the time but his partner told me recently and I was really disappointed as I wanted to treat him and instead bummed him thanks to the deterioration of what once was a great restaurant.      Recently I suggested to my wife that we try them again perhaps and she said, \"no way\".    I had to agree.  I have to recommend that people not patronize this place until it get's it's house in order.   Something is very off here and for some time now."}
{"text":"Sometimes I wonder is Paisan's gets more business and rave reviews because of their lake view. Their pasta dishes are meh, I could get better pasta at olive garden or even make it myself. The cheese bread was also rather bland and disappointing."}
{"text":"5-star Happy Hour - now served with chicken strips.   As if the $3 Long Islands, rail drinks and drafts weren't enough - the bar side of Paisan's now serves up chicken fingers among its handful of happy hour munchies.  You could sit in a cozy booth (or out on the patio, not recommended November-April) and have a couple of drinks, fries, and of course, chicken strips - and land yourself a $15 tab. Not too shabby.   I'm not completely sure which hours are happy. It starts early, I want to say around noon, and goes until 6:00 or 6:30."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here last week and everything was excellent! We got to sit out on the patio on a beautiful sunny day without having to wait. The food and service was also exceptional!"}
{"text":"We went there just for the view.  They do have that.  The rest was just Meh.  There was a wait to be seated even though there was less than 6 groups in the place.  Server was slow and made a point to tell us she had been there since they opened that day and was tired.  Food was basic but plentiful.  Ordered the seafood pasta, all the \"seafood\" in it was the fake stuff.  Tasted like it as well.  Not good, not good at all.  Drinks were weak and their well known sangria was bland.  Parking was nice and easy but I would think not so much during a warm summer night.  Probably will find a different place next time."}
{"text":"I loved sitting outside and sipping a coctail with a lovely water view as we waited for a table.  The drink prices are amazing during happy hour, which goes until 7pm.   The dining room where we were seated was a bit dark, but comfortable.  We tried the hot cheese bread, since it was reccommended by a fellow yelper, it was just a small loaf of italian bread with melted cheese on top, it was ok.  I had a lovely salad and the 6\" pesto personal pizza.  It was very good and just the right size for me.  The entrees are very large and smothered in melted cheese from what i could see.  I wouldn't call it fine dining, but it was ok."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite secret indulgence for me but only if I stay to my scheduled routine: patio seating, capital tap beer, porta salad, garibaldi sandwich.  Everything else on the menu is not as good and better purchased at Delitalia, where its cheaper and you have the freedom to go home and eat it while watching Dexter on the couch.  Seriously, people."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my wife and three friends. Our server was pretty rude to us and actually rolled his eyes when we asked about certain dishes or if they had any specials. It was candidly pretty benign set of questions yet he seemed completely annoyed. I get that we all have bad days but you don't need to take it out on the people that are ordering food. The food itself tasted pretty good. We ordered a number of dishes including cheesy garlic bread, pizza several different salads, spaghetti and meat sauce, and an Italian sausage. All dishes were pretty solid.  The food came out pretty fast and was a relatively good value considering the price. Great view of the lake."}
{"text":"I thought this was a very tasty restaurant with a view of Lake Monona; went on a Sunday afternoon so there were plenty of open tables. The service was prompt, professional and not overbearing.  The salads were simple yet tasty that came in two sizes, great French/Bleu Cheese crumble dressing as well. The pizzas came in various sizes, served in their own pie pan. Decently priced, and they validate parking! The only problem were the brat children seated around us screaming and crying! Madison, control your demon seed or leave those kids at Grandmas or Daycare! Nobody wants unruly, out of control kids under the age of 12 screaming & crying....God! What a lunchtime downer."}
{"text":"I enjoy Paisan's - I really do. I've had some good dining experiences. Nothing earth shattering, mind you, but I've never had a bad meal. Having said that, I have a few things I want to highlight.  ~ The cheese bread is SO delicious (I swear there's crack in it or something). It's perfectly crispy yet tender and flavorful topped with copious amounts of mozzarella. Eat the cheese bread!!!  ~ Getting the spicy cheese rather than the regular cheese on a pizza is a VERY wise decision. And the Italian sausage is just THE best.  ~ They kept our water glasses full which I so appreciate. Many places forget this important detail.  ~ The service was just.............meh. Our server was odd and when we asked a question about wine selection his reaction was to boldly tell us employees \"aren't allowed to drink\" there. Well, ok, but you don't have to drink there to be knowledgeable about the wine selection. See..........odd. He just didn't seem like someone who really knew what he was doing and definitely lacked in people skills.  I'm sure we'll be back. I just hope we have a different server next time."}
{"text":"There is no way I'd ever spend my money on this place again.    Paisan's is still making it's business off the reputation at it's previous location in downtown Madison.  The food, from what I hear, used to be really good.  Now the food is inedible and the service is well below average.  The only thing saving this place is the atmosphere and the location.  The bar and lounge area have a very unique view of Monona, and a rustic feel of an Old Italian bistro from the 40's or 50's.  It's a shame then, that the food and service don't live up to what could be a phenomenal restaurant.  I went with a party of 12 and the food and service we received was abyssmal.  Drink orders weren't taken until we'd been sitting for quite some time.  The shrimp corn chowder was flavorless and bland and the ravioli I ordered was served cold.  When I asked for it to be reheated, you could tell it had been done in a microwave as it returned in about 2 minutes with scalding hot marinara and the ravioli still undercooked.  Others in my party ordered Pizza (which is what Paisan's is known for).  The pizza was worse than what you'd find in a grade school cafeteria.  The sauce was clearly from a can and the cheese tasted like it was Industrial grade meant for military consumption only.  The only redeeming quality was the dough was clearly hand made and had a good crust and chew.  It's so unfortunate that a place like this could be so terrible.  Some modifications to the menu preparation and the wait staff and I would love this to become a regular place in my restaurant rotation.  Unfortunately it's just going to have to go down as one of the worst places in Madison."}
{"text":"A Madison classic serving \"classic\" Italian food as in the same things they were serving 3 decades agon when I was a student living in Madison.  Now, my tastes in Italian run more to the authentic and less to Americanized food that defined these type of restaurants when Italinan food was considered \"ethnic\" and \"exotic.\"  While it is a great festive atmosphere, especially after a football game, the food is fine but not something I'd go out of my way for."}
{"text":"I have been here for a birthday party and a date night. Each time on the outdoor patio, each time on a gorgeous evening.   The drinks and the service and great! But the atmosphere is why I give it four stars. The patio overlooks Lake Monona and the back on the Monona Terrace.  My husband and I shared a sandwich and an appetizer and just enjoyed the chill vibe of the night! I am not sure if we would have a full dinner here as I would give the food 3 stars, but will definitely return for drinks and outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to give Paisan's a \"Meh\", because it's a Madison staple (especially in my family), but I'm just not that fired up about it. I've had both lunch and dinner here, and while the food is never bad, per se, it's also not outstanding - and for the price of some items, it should earn at least a \"really good\". Mozzarella bread, for example, is fine, but would be easy (and way cheaper) to make at home - it's just two big pieces of bread with some cheese sprinkled on it and put in the oven. The only thing about my most recent meal at Paisan's that stood out to me was the seasoning on the crust of my taco pizza. And the fact that my menu pages were water-damaged and falling apart, and that the booth area we were sitting in felt a lot like a Catholic church confessional. :/  Overall: Not a bad place, I guess, but pretty solidly \"meh.\""}
{"text":"The location is beautiful and the food is great. I really love their pizzas (and I'm a bit of a pizza snob). They have so many to choose from. Their pasta dishes are great as well, I really enjoyed the black fettuccine with Alfredo sauce. For an appetizer, don't pass up the spicy cheese bread, it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Paisan's has the best patio dining location in Madison, hands down. The view over the lake is gorgeous and definitely date-worthy, but it can be chilly with the breeze off the lake. However, the food, wait and service can at times leave something to be desired.  First off, it can be kinda tricky to get here. You have to go up to the Capitol loop and back track to get onto the one way street, but once you arrive they offer free covered parking with validation. Once you arrive there will be a considerable wait (especially if you want to eat outside) and they don't take reservations, so you'll have to stick it out in the bar area. My personal tip would be don't cave and take a spot inside, the booths are wood and rather uncomfortable, the food's just okay, and you're really here for the view.  I've dabbled around on the menu and tried a variety of three star quality items like the very plain Italian Sausage and Peppers and the Porta Salad with garbanzo beans. All the sort of food I could easily make for the same caliber at home with less than ten minutes of prep. This is not really the type of thing I want to spend my money on when I'm out. I've settled on the seafood tetrazzini with the spinach fettuccine noodles as my go to option now. It's very creamy and super filling, two or three meals for me easily. It seems silly that they don't offer real crabmeat in it though, I'm paying $17 for a dinner that's 80% noodles, they could at least give me 2 oz of something better than imitation crab. Anyway, all the food is good, it's just not anything special in my opinion."}
{"text":"Four stars for happy hour! I've been to Paisan's three times, all of them to take advantage of their happy hour that runs from 11 am to 6 pm. Here's what you need to know:  + What a difference a day makes. On a Wednesday it was pretty dead and we were able to walk around to the lake side after getting out drinks and have the whole dining patio to ourselves. We came back on Friday and the bar was packed. Like, barely enough room to move packed. Paisan's appears to be a popular weekend kickoff spot for other businesses in the building.   + Prices are CHEAP. Rail drinks are $2. Tall Long Islands are $3.50. Old Fashioneds are $3. Prices include tax which is great, especially if you're paying with cash.  + The drinks are boozy. And by boozy I mean they are almost straight liquor. Our Long Islands were literally 90% liquor. You only need one, and you probably want a designated driver.  + The happy hour specials are only available in the bar, so don't get a table in the restaurant if you want these sweet, sweet deals.  It had been a few years since my first Paisan's trip, so on my return I noticed we had been charged an extra dollar each on our Long Islands for a \"bump up.\" I wasn't super pumped about being up-charged for something I didn't ask for and didn't have any clue what it was, but since $4.50 was more than reasonable for the glass of booze I had received I didn't say anything. On our next trip my drinking buddy ordered a Long Island and the bartender asked if he wanted to upgrade for a dollar to a hand-poured version; the $3.50 would be pre-mixed. That explained our up-charge on the visit before; the bartender probably just assumed we'd want the hand-poured version.   Pro tip: if you, like me, can't have caffeine, they're happy to make you a Long Beach (the same boozy base as a Long Island, but with cranberry instead of cola). Enjoy getting sloshed with everybody else!"}
{"text":"Well, I fee like I'm on a roll here in badger town, Locating better places to eat. I was finally able to make it over to Paisan's to try their pie - it was very good!  I elected for my half (split a large pie with my colleague and go-to partner in crime - restauranteur) to go with the \"spicy cheese\" specialty pie. It came loaded with tons of thinly sliced onions, delicious pepperoni and, an often forgotten sleeper-good topping, banana peppers!  Despite my hesitation about this cheese blended pie, I was quite surprised at how well everything tastes together. I'm without a doubt a \"purest\" when it comes to pizza and again, this pie caught me off guard. Definitely worth a return trip fo-sho!"}
{"text":"I will never understand why this extremely mediocre if not downright bad restaurant has the loyal following that it does. Obviously, lots of people have no  sophisticated taste when it comes to food and are glad to eat lots of cheese-filled, high- carbohydrate unhealthy, uninteresting food. The acoustics in the bar are atrocious, the service in the restaurant varies between mediocre and bad and the only tasty item on the menu is the vegetarian pesto pizza. For what one gets, the prices are on the high side. The menus are sometimes food-splattered and the windows to the outside dining area are not clean. They are lucky to have the near-lakeside location --if not they'd definitely have fewer customers-- but even eating outside on a slightly breezy day while traffic zooms by below on John Nolen Dr.is far from a pleasurable experience."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did. The location is awesome and it's just a short walk from where I live. Unfortunately, though a friend had said many great things, it was just awful. If I could give this place negative stars, I would.   We'll start with the positive: the wait for everything was short. I don't really expect nice cocktails from a place like Paisan's, so I just got a Peroni, bottled beer is bottled beer. It was just as tasty as every other Peroni I've had.   And now for the rest:   My friend made the mistake of ordering a long island, the fancy handmade version. Yes, for an extra dollar or so you'll be spared a premixed long island. I don't think it was worth the money though, because it may as well have been a premixed cocktail from the grocery store. Another friend, not generally the picky sort, ordered a coffee and couldn't even drink it.   I imagine the decor made the place quaint and inviting when they first opened, but at this point it's rather dated and dark , and I'm pretty sure the place hasn't had a thorough cleaning in years. The menus were also really sticky, which didn't inspire confidence.  To begin with they brought us bread. It was fine, basic sourdough. Sourdough is super strange at an Italian restaurant, but whatever. I'm not one to pass up bread and butter. We got garlic bread for the table, and it was meh. I'm pretty sure it was the frozen stuff that you can get at costco or whatever. It tasted freezer-burned, anyway.  For our meal my husband and I decided to order a vegetarian pesto pizza to share. When they brought our food to the table my first thought was \"What is that smell?\" Turns out it was the entire can of black olives that they dumped on top of the pizza (without draining them?). The smell was close to intolerable. Now, I don't ever expect that I'm going to get authentic Italian food in Madison, but this tasted worse than some of the frozen pizzas I've had. I'd be willing to bet pretty much anything that the pesto was from a jar. The tomatoes weren't romas, as they should be (not egregious, but it didn't help). The cheese was rather plastic-like... I could have choked it down, but at $15 for a 9\" pizza, I just had to send it back. On second thought, there was no way I was going to eat that thing.   When I told our waiter that we were sending it back, I sort of felt bad for him. He seemed a little afraid of the back of the house. When he asked what was wrong with our pizza, I didn't know where to start.   To their credit the manager came over to try and make us happy, but based on the rest of the food I saw come to the table I was already planning to order a pizza from somewhere else when we got home. The manager also asked what was wrong with the food. I ended up citing the putrid olive scent and the pesto that tasted nothing like pesto. Then he had the nerve to tell me, in effect, that I didn't know what pesto was supposed to taste like. Having lived in northern Italy, I've had my fair share of pizza and pesto, so I think I know what to expect...especially when the menu states that it's made from a \"traditional northern Italy recipe\".   Overall I felt like I was on an episode of restaurant impossible, and, needless to say,  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Round 2: I started my evening out with a Cosmo (Happy Hour) I think the bartender forgot to add alcohol . We ordered the Super Hot Pizza, which was made very close to authentic Italian pizza. It was quite tasty & very spicy as stated. We also ordered Spinach Bread which was nothing special at all.   We sat at a table with a view of the lake which was beautiful. The service was much better this time. It was a great pit stop before Manona Terrace.   If you done here, ask for a table with a view. It absolutely worth the extra 10 mins wait :-)"}
{"text":"Downtown Madison is full of expensive restaurants so it's nice to find one that is reasonably priced and affordable and offers free underground parking.  We went on a cold winter night and were seated in the smaller dining room with a fireplace overlooking Lake Monona. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive.  We started with a couple of soups. Both the clam chowder and chili received above average marks.  Paisans is noted for their Garibaldi sandwich and their Porta salad. The salad was very good. 3 of our party ordered the Garibaldi. This is a hot sandwich on a toasted bun. Unfortunately none of the 3 sandwiches had properly toasted buns. The top buns were warm and soft, no crunch or toast whatsoever. The rest of the sandwich was very good.  The Super Hot pizza had a perfectly crisp thin crust with hot and banana pepper, pepperoni and cheese.   This is a great place to hang out in the summer as they have a large patio overlooking the lake.  Patio seating requires a food purchase."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night, got seated immediately.  My husband and I each got the porta salads that people rave about, the spicy cheezy bread, and I had the cheese cannoli,and my husband had the chicken parm served on a bun.  I would say all in all it was decent.  Nothing to rave about whatsoever.  The service was very good, but the food was just lacking all together.  In my opinion the chz bread should have been served with a side of sauce, and the chz cannoli was a bit doughy tasting.  The salads were very good.  Maybe go back and try something different????"}
{"text":"The best way to describe my experience at Paisan's is totally bummed.  My parents-in-law both went to undergrad at UW Madison and LOVED Paisan's at the time.  Perhaps it was a combination of them talking it up and my natural love for Italian food setting my expectations too high or something, but there was not a single item at the table that stood out or left us chatting about how good it was (and if you knew my family, you would know that's strange since we almost always talk incessantly about the food we're eating while we're eating it!).  Manicotti was \"blah\" -- the cheese just didn't have much flavor and the sauce was boring.  It somehow even tasted a bit dry... ?!  The Garibaldi is the fav choice of my parents-in-law, though even they agreed it just wasn't as great as it used to be.  The bread it came on was awesome, but the rest was no better than Subway.  They claim to be \"voted Madison's best pizza\" on their website, but the Vegetarian Pesto pizza was maybe just above average to me.  Good flavor, but I've definitely been more impressed elsewhere.  (Perhaps there aren't many pizza options in Madison?) ;]  To be fair, the toasted spicy cheese bread was pretty delicious, but was nothing I couldn't easily replicate at home and wasn't worth $9.  The location is GORGEOUS -- right on the lake -- but the rest of it was a total let down and utterly forgettable.  In fact... wait... what place are we talking about again? ;]"}
{"text":"I thought about giving Paisan's just one star but decided the amazing view was worth another. I'll start by saying that there probably isn't another restaurant in Madison with such a prime, waterfront location.  And that's a huge shame because the food here is no good. It's supposedly Italian, but less authentic (and less tasty) than Olive Garden. The dishes are so plain - why should I go out to eat to order spaghetti in tomato sauce? Sure, at a really good Italian place simple works well, but here the food really does not taste professional at all. Pizza is the easiest thing in the world to make taste amazing yet at Paison's it is so mediocre. It probably says something about the kitchen's culinary expertise that the menu boasts a ham sandwich with banana peppers as the restaurant's most famous item.  I would only say go here if you must, must eat on the water downtown. Even then, I would probably rather get food at the terrace or something."}
{"text":"If they hadn't changed their location, it was a sure-shot 5 stars! The old location inside University Square mall was just awesome. The food was unbelievably tasty and cheap! The food's still good, but the price is slightly higher now, given the nicer location. I'd give it a try if I'm in the vicinity."}
{"text":"Visiting Madison from Chicago and arrived hungry. Had a great meal; started with a great salad with cheese and salami, ham and garbanzo beans. Cheese pizza was delicious and husband had the super hot pizza with pepperoni, banana peppers and jalapeños. He loved it. Also had stuffed spinach manicotti with tomato & mushroom sauce, spaghetti with meat sauce and shells with Alfredo sauce and broccoli. Everything was really good and we are a tough group. Pastas looked sort of basic, but flavors were really solid. It was a great choice."}
{"text":"Paisan's is a Madison must. Good food, good service and beautiful atmosphere. I am a native and it has been a favorite place of mine for pretty much my whole life.:)"}
{"text":"Was very pleased with all that was offered here. The food all around was excellent. Service was fine. My server seemed to be trying to hard (you know those kinds with the fake personality). But she did a very good job. Always checking in with me (and other customers). I started off with the poblano pepper cheese soup. This was fantastic. Nice and hot, perfect thickness and all around great taste. Had a caesar salad as well (with dressing on the side). Unfortunately these 2 items sort of filled me up. For my main entree I got the 3-meat cannelloni (stuffed with chicken, beef, and italian sausage). This was a very hearty portion. My only complaint about this was that the pasta was a little too gummy for me. But it had a great flavor. And because I stuffed myself with other food before hand I only finished off 1 1/2 of the 3 that was on the plate. I ordered the tiramisu to go. This was ok. I have had better. Was too much cake for me and not enough of the cheese or coffee flavor.  I would definitely come back to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Nice place for some Italian food outside overlooking the water. Had a good selection of beers and wine. Wait staff was nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"I've eaten here more times than I can count.  The atmosphere can be romantical and it's also great for groups.   I absolutely adore are the cannelloni (kind of like manicotti) which you can get with half red sauce and half white sauce.  Also the spicy cheese bread must be had.  I am a huge fan of the vegetable salad with the yogurt basil dressing, although most of my dining companions swear by the porta salad and the Garibaldi sandwich.  As for the pizza I have had some good and bad experiences depending on what was ordered, and I usually avoid it, because I already have my favorites.  A note to the foodies, this is not authentic Italian cuisine, the entrees are mostly reminiscent of an era 30-40 years ago.  They're still fabulous. For dessert try the chocolate chip cannolis, yeah not very Italian but they are still very scrumptious."}
{"text":"The best thing about Paisan's was our waitress, she was fantastic and salvaged a little bit of enjoyment out of the meal for me.    The two main parts of my dinner failed, the pasta and the cheese.  Call me crazy but a place called Paisan's that is located in Wisconsin should have gotten this right...it's like going to Florida and getting a concentrate orange juice.  The ravioli was overcooked, a lot.  The cheese on top of the overcooked ravioli was greasy and heavy.    I won't return."}
{"text":"Piasan's is a place that our parents generation would say used to be great, and I think they key is \"used to be\".  We decided to go halfs on the garabaldi & deluxe pizza. Boy did I get the short end of the stick, garabaldi is amazing, hands down best thing on the menu. The pizza was lacked flavor & seasoning, couldn't even eat it. I opted to get a side Caesar salad which for some reason had giant cherry tomatoes in it & wasn't tossed for me, which I would expect at a nicer restaurant.  I also tried the smaller than typical portion of the seafood tetrazzini which was watery and lacked flavor. To top it off, $9 glasses of weakly poured wine make me second guess returning. Unless it's a summer day and you have a window seat, can't beat that beautiful view!"}
{"text":"This was recommended as a fine Italian restaurant to us.  The food did not meet those expectations in any way.  I ordered spaghetti and paid extra for the mushroom sauce, thinking that it would taste like mushroom and be amazing.  It was neither.  My food came to me at the table some cold.  I watched everyone else eat as I was waiting for our server to come back to the table.  When she finally did, I sent my food back for reheating.  It came back warm on the sides and cold in the middle. The taste of the pasta was gummy and pasty.  Frankly I've had better pastas and sauces at Fazolis. I would have expected, at the very least, a comp for the cold food presented to me twice."}
{"text":"The food is meh, the drinks are fine.  But this business also actively works against improvements to the square. They are out for themselves, not the community."}
{"text":"This is a staple restaurant in Madison and one my extended family is freakin' obsessed with. No, correction, they are freakin' obsessed with the Garibaldi sandwich. O B S E S S E D. I'm not joking: my uncle asked for 14 uncooked Garibaldis from this place recently (as in, before Thanksgiving this year recent) and they gave them to him. He freezes them for later savoring since he lives in the Fox Valley. Can you believe it?! When I was here with some family, my aunt made off with two for later savoring and she lives in town. My uncle freakin' proposed over these sandwiches. LEGIT. They are dedicated fans of the Garibaldi from Paisan's, and I knew I absolutely must try one. I'm actually surprised I made it 30 years without having one shoved in my face.  I'm pretty sure this place has been here forever. It overlooks Lake Monona and you can see some pretty beautiful sunsets here. It's got that classic style for an American Italian joint: lots of wood, a fireplace, and plenty spacious. It feels warm and homey inside, just like their menu.   Their wine list is short and what I would consider a bit on the basic side, but their red sangria is delicious and I would recommend it. They also have cocktails and, from the taste I had, they are also good.  Okay, so: the Garabaldi. Let's talk about this sandwich that isn't named after a character on \"Babylon 5\" (If you get this reference, send me a compliment and we'll do virtual high fives for being awesome people. If you don't get this reference, sorry you're lame.) This thing has got ham, salami, pepper jack cheese, tomatoes and your choice of peppers. I like banana peppers a lot, so I went with the bananas. The secret, though, is the magic sauce and the magic bread. Okay, I don't know if the bread is actually magic, but my uncles have spent significant time tracking down ingredients to try to emulate this sandwich (I mentioned my entire extended family is obsessed with this sandwich, right?) and one of the things they struggled with is the bread. They managed to find something about right, so the bread may not be as pure magic as the sauce is. The sauce, though, is definitely pure magic. It MAKES this sandwich. It adds just the right kind of sweet/spicy/Italian kick. I can't properly describe it; it must be experienced!  So, my opinion of the Garabaldi is that it is delicious and definitely a must-order if you're here. It's not good enough to convince me to drive four hours from Minneapolis in annoying traffic on 94 just to get 20 uncooked versions of it to go to freeze for later savoring, but I would stop in for one of these again the next time I'm in town for sure."}
{"text":"Paisan's is a wonderful restaurant that serves Italian food that is better than Olive Garden but not quite as good as you'd find in Italy ;). The food is delicious. I love their Cesar salad and meatball subs.   I've enjoyed each experience I have had here. If you're looking for a fancier restaurant that won't break the bank, then this is the place to try. This restaurant has a wonderful view of Lake Mendota. You can choose to either sit outside or inside and still see the water."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Madison.  Great pizza and pasta plus dont miss the spicey cheese bread it alone would be worth the trip.  The view is great.  If its a nice day eating outside on the patio is a nice option.   This is my go to place to take someone new to Madison."}
{"text":"What a complete disappointment.  We live nearby, and yesterday had some big and exciting news to celebrate. It was late and nice outside so we decided to talk a walk to Paisan's and try it for the first time.  What do you do when you need to celebrate? You order champagne. We ordered 25 dollar champagne. We got ... a BOTTLE OF COOK'S. Really?? REALLY? If you are going to serve us cheap champagne, fine, but at LEAST be smart enough to get something no one will recognize! What's more, while the waiter was nice and all, he wasted tons of our champagne. He didn't pour it right so it fizzed all kinds and he kept spilling it. THANKS. That was our 25 dollar bottle of effin' Cook's you just wasted.  We tried to move on, and order an appetizer. It's pretty much bread and cheese, or bread and cheese. Or bread and garlic. Cool. It was fine, but nothing special.  The pizzas were also fine, but nothing special. I got vegetarian pesto, Derek got the spicy one. I think these people are relying WAYYYY too much on their name, their legacy, and crappy Kraft cheese.  Way too much cheese. Really good cheese can be used in just the right amount for perfect flavor -- if you add a ton of bland, poor quality cheese to something, that's not going to make it suddenly taste better!!!  Desserts? Meh. Derek was horrified to find the tiramisu cut like a pie slice and not a square. (he's picky)  It was a pretty building. The acoustics in the back room, the one overlooking the \"lake\" (read: freeway) are terrible though. Also, it's dirty. The floors were covered.  I'm thinking ... never again. Not worth my close-to-90 dollars. And it ruined our celebration. I really wish we had gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here last weekend. Our server was spot on without being overbearing and the dinners were all amazing. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Judging by the reviews I'm assuming much of their food is not spectacular.  I couldn't tell you because I only come here for one reason: the Garibaldi.  My friends will tell you I have a penchant for hyperbole but believe me when I say, \"This is the best sandwich in the world\".  The Italian Bread is crisp and buttery, the cheese and meat are always cooked to perfection and the combination of sweet and hot peppers gives the sandwich the perfect finishing touch.  I've been here numerous times in my life.  It was one of my dad's haunts back when he was an undergrad.  Every time I've been, big group or small, the service has always been fast and friendly.  My particular favorite experience came at my bachelor party with a party of eleven rowdy guys.  The waiter took it in stride, brought shots I most certainly didn't ask for and, as if great service wasn't enough, he split the $1 cup of marinara I asked for up between the other ten guys.  There's nothing better than a waiter that can gauge the mood of a group and is able to adjust to it.  I hope they're able to keep it up so that I can one day take my kids here!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick pizza and a Spotted Cow.  We sat in the bar area to avoid the wait in the main restaurant and cleverly ordered our pizza 'to go.'  The bar area was friendly and the service was fast.  Loved the pizza-the crust was excellent and it was piled high with toppings.  It's also super close to the conference center, which is why we landed here."}
{"text":"My family and I come here every couple of months. To be fair my wife really likes this place so I get dragged along. She's a runner and carbs up every time we come.   Service is great, they are very kid friendly. Weather permitting they have great outdoor seating , nice view, you just hope it's not too windy.  Menu is standard Italian, done pretty average."}
{"text":"I will be honest in that I don't think I can give this place a review that isn't horribly biased by my nostalgia. As a kid, I loved going to Paisans eating pizza in those tall wood booths, and getting Andes candies on the way out.  The new location still has the booths, but also an outdoor patio, and a bar! The outdoor seating is wonderful, and often busy on nice spring and summer days. For winter date nights there is no more perfect spot in the city than one paisan's booths. The panels give you the perfect amount of seclusion for private conversations. I love the pizza, it has a very flavorful sauce and a cracker crisp crust. And if you wanna go carb crazy, I highly recommend the garlic bread. They have some good sandwiches too. The pasta is atrocious, but I don't go to paisan's for the pasta. The sangria is great, and they also make a pretty decent old fashioned. If you make it for happy hour, the prices are great."}
{"text":"Maybe I am too much east coast.   We waited 45 minutes for a table.   Great outside seating.   Seating in bar area to wait also.  Was looking for great Italian after traveling.  I knew I was in trouble when the menu referred to \"red sauce\".   I thought it was safe to order chicken parm.  The waitress assured me that it was a cutlet.  I felt a little better until she asked me \"what kind of noodle I wanted \"  I asked for spaghetti  al dente.  \" they only serve it with red sauce\"  I explained I didn't want it mushy.  All noodles are cooked the same mushy.   The place was packed with locals.  I guess it is what you are accustomed to."}
{"text":"This place in its old location was a college favorite. Have only dined at this location a couple of times when in town visiting. The dingy parking garage with poor signage is a bad welcome.   We wanted an outdoor table on this beautiful Sunday evening but were told the wait was 1.5 hours so we asked for an indoor table with view. After 25 mins they had no indoor seats but a patio table. Strange.  Also the drink I ordered while waiting was so weak I should have taken it back.   Our server was very helpful but they appeared understaffed especially the kitchen. Once we ordered we got our excellent Porta salads in 10 mins but then it was 30-40 mins to get our entrees. The pasta special was just ok but the Garabaldi sandwich was tasty.   It took another 20 mins to get our check and to pay up. Disappointing experience overall."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorites downtown has turned into a location I wouldn't send my enemy's to. Food use to be amazing, and today I went out with family to celebrate my birthday. Group of 11 of us waited a few minutes to sit, not a problem but the food..... no seasoning, completely bland and zero flavor. I was embarrassed to have several new comers come to one of my favorites and was completely let down. I had the chicken tetrazzini, which had zero sauce and the noodles have been burnt due to whatever oven they put it in. One of my in-laws had lasagna which was completely drowned in marinara sauce. Girlfriend had Alfredo that was completely bland. Spoke with a manager who was willing to deduct the meal, but that wasn't really what we're looking for. Obviously the food has changed, and would prefer a much better product for the amount of money that you pay at this restaurant. I miss the old Paisians.... probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Small venue with huge taste! 2000 miles from my favorite home Thai food and found a GEM! Food is fantastic, staff is great and wait (if any) is worth it!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with another couple.  We also had our 5 daughters with.  Pizza was very good. Garlic bread with cheese was not worth the money.  Waitress told us the pizzas would be a while, just to get us to order something else.  She wasn't overly friendly.  Just brought us food and gave us the bill.  Would expect a little more in Madison."}
{"text":"I've had Chef Boyardee cold from the can that was tastier than what we had last night. Our server, Sean, was the only saving grace of the evening.   Yes, the view is lovely but if they don't find a chef that can at least throw together a decent spaghetti dish, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I came for dinner and had a drink at the bar first. The bar area is set up nicely and a fun spot for a before dinner drink. For dinner, I had an individual pizza. The toppings are large and you get a lot of them. My issue was that the pizza just lacked some flavor. Not sure if it was the sauce or lack of seasoning. Their Porto salad is delicious and a must try.   The restaurant itself has a lot of character and different sections to it. You can also get a great view of Lake Monona. The staff is friendly and quick to help when they can. The food is very expensive for being mediocre."}
{"text":"Dude, my parents went here in college when they went to UW, and now I go here when I visit my Aunt & Uncle who live in Stoughton.  Great old-pizza-joint environment with plastic, faceted beer pitchers and college-kid service.  Oh, and the pizza's pretty good too."}
{"text":"With a recent move from the now defunct University Square, Paisan's boasts an excellent terrace overlooking Lake Monona.  The interior keeps the dark intimate booths from the old location with a nice expanded bar.    As far as the food, the porta salad is pretty top notch.  However, the rest of the dishes are merely average.  The sauces are either too bland or too rich and the pizza, while adequate, isn't anything to write home about."}
{"text":"What's happened to one of my favorite restaurants?!?! Went on Sunday August 28 to celebrate the end of summer with my family... service was not good and the food was horrible. I've had better frozen meals...  My daughter, wife and I had the chicken tetrazzini- chicken was like the cheap cubed stuff, everything was dry from sitting somewhere too long... I was embarrassed. $100+ later we left hungry.  Olive Garden is a better choice. Sad"}
