{"text":"I went there for my lunch n I must say one of the worst chinese food ever I got in my life..it was tasteless n only full of soya sauce...really disappointed:("}
{"text":"China Jade: best Chinese food in the world? Not according to this guy: http://blogs.laweekly.com/squidink/2012/06/david_chan_chinese_restaurants.php  China Jade: worst Chinese food in the world? I don't think so.  I guess it's somewhere in btween?!? I ordered food there once and it was pretty good. Also, this is my first Yelp review eva. Am I doing ok?  Also, I don't like Chinese food, generally speaking, but this was ok.  Also, I think if one is to eat Chinese food, General Tsao's is a good choice.  Also, I think we'll be getting CHINA JADE instead of Domino's for games now, because China Jade is pretty good and delivers and Domino's is not quite as pretty good but delivers.  Basically, we just need a good delivery place in Tempe to bring us food while we gamez?  Also, can you tell me a better delviery place?  Seth, Seth, Seth, Seth!"}
{"text":"The worst food ever! I thought I was going to get something fresh, but instead of that I got something that looks more like microwaved food. The egg roll was disgusting, and I had to throw it away. Never again!"}
{"text":"food taste like its daaaayyyyyyysssssss old, rice was stale beef was gummy and soggy. i'm going to call the bbb and health department im not sure you can sell this food to the public."}
{"text":"I feel bad giving one star because the delivery was extremely fast but I have to say me and my husband were very disappointed in the food. #33 Singapore Mein Fun was dry spaghettini noodles with curry powder on top as an after thought- so bad we had to throw away. Vegetable fried rice was very bland and had very large tasteless vegetables. House Low Mein had slightly better flavor however the pieces of shrimp still had skin on them and there was a sand-like texture- maybe they weren't properly cleaned. The egg and spring rolls taste like ones you can buy at the grocery store and the cream cheese won-tons had no crunch. It's awful spending money on food where you have to end up re-cooking items just to add flavor.  Who knows maybe the cook that night was new ( Sat night) - because some other people had great experience.  I NEVER give bad reviews so I'm not just a negative person, always complaining. We just had an awful experience with this food.."}
{"text":"For years my husband and I have complained about the lack of good, inexpensive Chinese food in town. Not anymore! The food and ambience may not be as fancy as other places in town, but it's good, reasonably priced, fast and the staff is lovely. We've tried a variety of chicken, beef and vegetarian dishes and they're all great. Best of all? While our friends were preordering their Christmas Day-Chinese food dinner 4 hours in advance we called China Jade and 20 minutes later picked up our food. No wait or fuss. And the food was delicious! They even deliver!"}
{"text":"Wow. So this was the second time I tried this place. First time I got the egg noodle soup and dumplings. The egg noodle soup was this globby goop that had old nasty veggies. The dumplings were very questionable as to what was in them, basically I could have bought better food from the frozen section of the grocery store.   This time, I used their website to order and pick up. I checked to see if there were any pictures to double check what I wanted, alas there were none even though they have a place on their site that says \"Gallery.\" So I Googled instead and online it says that Chow Mein was a fried noodle with veggies and sauce and lo mein was soft noodles and veggies and sauce. I got the Chow Mein. I instantly got a call from the restaurant to double check what I wanted. I said I wanted noodles, with veggies, and chicken. She told me it was with a white sauce and it was very hard to understand the rest. I got it  home and it was this gloppy thick \"white\" sauce with nothing but weird bits of lettuce, chicken, onions, and gross looking celery. Nasty. AND no noodles, just some weird fried bits I assume that's what she meant by \"crunch noodles.\"   Perhaps my misunderstanding, but my God it did not even look edible for someone who wanted to have Chow Mein. My boyfriend got the roasted pork in garlic sauce but he threw his away too because it was just all goo sauce, like thick gel for a sauce. He tried a bite and couldn't eat it at all.   So lastly, we had ordered so spring rolls. Those were also disappointing. They were soggy and tasted like they had been made then they were frozen, not fresh.   I don't write reviews often, but damn I was disappointed and I looked to Yelp before I went were I found mixed reviews, so I took a chance. NEVER EVER AGAIN will I be going to China Jade."}
{"text":"Can't say we'll be coming back to this place anytime soon.  Hot and sour soup was thick and oily - hard to taste any flavor with that texture.  Biggest complaint with the General Tso's was the size of the chicken.  Too large = too little breading to chicken ratio, plus the sauce was a cheap imitation.  I didn't try my wife's szechuan chicken but she didn't seem enamored of the dish.  We'll be looking elsewhere for our chinese fix in the future."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for at least 25-30 years - we love this place! Their food is so flavorful and delicious. Their sauces are outstanding! They use chicken breast - not the cuts you find in most other Chinese restaurants. So good!"}
{"text":"So I waited an hour and a half for my delivery. Even though I live 10 minutes away!! The chicken in the chicken lo mein tasted like it came from a dollar store frozen dinner. Of course everything was cold and to cap it all off the delivery guy spent 5 minutes trying to give me a menu for another unrelated store he delivered for!?"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food. Good service and clean restaurant. They have takeout and a sit-in restaurant. Favorite Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the worst place ever! If I could give it no stars I would... first off the delivery guy gave our food to the wrong people and blamed us saying \"well we said we got it and we're eating it so we're liars\" it ended up being that they mixed up our order with someone else's in a different building! When we figured that out they said \"well the other people never ordered food they just stole yours\" I reached out to my co workers in the other building and she said we ordered 60$ worth of food and when we realized this was not our food they said just pack it back up so we can deliver it to the right people!!! That is freaking disgusting!! And the chicken was RAW!!! They accused our security guards of stealing and our co workers because they didn't want to accept their mistake! I will never come here again and I hope no one else does either! And if you do check your meat!! BTW the manager is a complete DICK kept calling us liars and screaming at us saying he was losing money and blah blah!"}
{"text":"Very fast delivery!  The food is really yummy,  and there was alot of it!  So happy with my order!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Fast delivery, large portions and reasonble price. Food is solid!"}
{"text":"Their food is inedible. Even a burger from Jack in the Box would be a better food.   I have ordered 3 different meals there via delivery: seafood soup,  one called 'seafood delight' and their 'mongolian chicken'. Overall quality of their food is awful: seafood dishes had almost no real seafood - just a couple of precooked shrimps and artificial fish rolls.      All 3 dishes appeared to be just a combination of undercooked, almost raw wedges with some filling for tortilla soup which you usually see in all-you-can-eat buffets.  Looks like their cooking process of seafood dishes is just throwing together some raw wedges, cheapest pre-cooked shrimps with fishrolls (a.k.a. crab rolls, but that's not a real crab meat, just a processed fish with artificial flavors added), and warming it up with filling for the tortilla soup.   Mongolian chicken was just as bad: undercooked, almost raw onions with lots of soy souse and chicken strips that seemed to be pre-cooked separately.  Overall opinion about their food: tasteless, like paper.  And, it is obviously made from cheapest ingredients purchased with bulk pricing."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight- both my hubby and I really enjoyed it! Food was very fresh, and great tasting! Not always easy to find in Phoenix. We would definitely recommend, and will be ordering again and again I'm sure!"}
{"text":"China jade more like china shit This place sucks 0/10 I would rather eat gum from my shoes..my orange chicken had more orange peels in it than chicken and my coconut shrimp looked and tasted like a bowl of milk with shrimp on top The delivery guy was also a dbag who didn't even come out of his car to give my my food and made me walk across the street for it  The only good thing I got to eat from here was a water bottle"}
{"text":"We used the app last night to order delivery.  With an average three star rating we weren't sure what we were going to get.  We were not disappointed!  The food arrived fast, within 15 minutes, was hot and delicious.    We ordered the chicken with mushrooms and snow peas and Hunan spicy beef and chicken.  Both got rave reviews.    Ordering and paying through the app was very easy!"}
{"text":"Ive been coming here since I was a child.  When I think of Chinese, this is what I compare everything to.  I live in san diego now, and I can't find any chinese like this.  Best wonton soup and egg rolls you'll find anywhere."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Tempe, no questions asked. I haven't had anything from there I didn't like. Also, in ordering from GrubHub one night, they messed up my order (which happens) and I called to complain.... tonight my order came with the dish they messed up. The note read - \"for free, because of last time.\" I didn't even have to mention it. Can't beat service like that either!"}
{"text":"Fast delivery. With in 20 minutes of ordering online using Eat24 app. Food was good. I was surprised. Would have have got 5 stars but no utensils or napkins. In a hotel you kind of need them so you don't have to walk to the front desk to see if they any."}
{"text":"About three weeks ago myself and two other co-workers placed a delivery order for food. We work at a hospital. I had given extremely specific directions to the delivery man as to where to find us in the hospital. We placed the order online so the directions would be printed out for him. I know it can be confusing to get around in a hospital so we were sure to be as detailed as possible. Time went on and a bit after an hour later we received a call from another department where we work.  They stated that the delivery man got confused and has our food there with them. He was still there when they called and I told her to tell him our department is straight down the hall, and that there would be a window with a doorbell to ring and we will get the food. He refused to walk down the hall because he claimed to have walked down it twice already and got lost. Lost? I gave specific directions. There are no other windows down the hall expect for ours. It is at the end of the hallway. It is a straight walk down. Where exactly can one get lost? He refused to walk to us and left while we were on the phone with her. He refused to talk to us. Seriously? Seriously. He up and left with giving our food to a complete stranger that had not ordered any food. Also, he could have called us at any time for help since he had my number, but he didn't. We ended up calling the restaurant and demanded for him to come back and bring us our food since he left it with a STRANGER.  When he finally came around he kept saying over that he got lost and I asked to see the sheet of paper in his hand with the directions and I told him \"The directions are right here. You are on the second floor. It's the end of the hallway. You have the directions in your hand.\" He didn't seem to care at all.   I will never forget such poor customer treatment."}
{"text":"Great food, all the meat was fabulous. Rice was cooked well. Wonton soup was excellent but needed more meat. Fast pick up. Def order there again"}
{"text":"It is twisted sticky Chinese food that caters to American taste, not the authentic one."}
{"text":"This was a huge let down. I ordered this along with some co-workers that recommended over Hong Kong Asian Cuisine where I usually order from. I will never stray from Hong Kong Asian Cuisine as this was the worst Lo Mein I have ever had. The noodles were some flat noodle with no sauce or seasoning and could not even take more than a few bites. The fried rice that came with my orange chicken was just brown rice with peas in it. The Orange Chicken was the one saving grace so i had something to choke down but I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Ordered $50 worth of food and when we received the wrong food and called to fix it, we were shouted at and blamed for the entire order problem. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for lunch at my work today and could not be so displeased with the food order. I ordered the chicken teriyaki with rice but the dish came back as half order. I paid $8 for a dish that had barely enough chicken with rice to fill the dish it came in. The food was mediocre at best. Not worth the money at all."}
{"text":"I always buy Chinese food from this restaurant when ever I like to have Chinese food. The portion size of the dish is large. The price is nearly the same for most of chinese resturant in the area. The vegetables are fresh . Very tasty Currys.  And the shrimp with snow peas is my favorite.  Basically it's a take away restaurant and has a limited number of dine in tables. They do home delivery."}
{"text":"Me and my coworkers usually order from here.  It's good if you're on a budget also.  But they seem to have been a little forgetful with some things lately.  I've asked not have certain vegetables in items that I've ordered and the last two times I've ordered they seem to make it in my food anyway.  And my side item didn't make it on my last order.  They didn't charge me for it so I'm not going to complain this time."}
{"text":"Worst food ever!!!!!!!!!!! And the customer service is worse! How can this place still be open? I ordered delivery and they got my order all wrong. When I called back to let them know the lady on the phone said it was my fault because I didn't know what I ordered!!!"}
{"text":"I normally am pretty nervous about ordering Chinese food to go. It usually ends in a horror story.  This was not the case!   Alright, so this is my first time ordering from China Jade and though it was unfortunate that there was a $15 minimum, I had no problem filling my order. They were, firstly, quick and timely. It said 45-60 minute wait, but they got here in 40. AWESOME! On top of that, Dominos pizza has a higher delivery rate than them. And I don't even LIKE egg rolls, only adding them to the order to try  out, but I LOVE these. They even gave me an extra one.   Never had Chow Mein and I got mine with shrimp. Tasty for a first timer!  However, the sesame chicken wasn't fabulous. It's usually my favorite Chinese food, however this one wasn't great. I've found, though, with Chinese, it's really hit or miss with sesame chicken.  Not to make it too long, but I enjoyed it. I'll definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"The food was great! The orange chicken was one of the best I've had! Staff was nice, but we didn't dine in. They were pretty quick when it came to take out! Ill def be back!"}
{"text":"This place isn't the best, but definitely not the worst.  I am actually glad I ate here just so I know how horrible the chinese restaurant down the hill from me is.  China Jade makes a great noodle dish and some nice sweet and sour pork,  the spring rolls are okay,  The sichuan dishes aren't as good as they could be.  Whatever you do, avoid the soup, it's the kind of soup you expect to eat when you're in the hospital after being in an accident that destroyed your tastebuds."}
{"text":"Best take-out/delivery chinese food in north central Scottsdale. Great taste, fresh and abundant vegetables, good meats used.  A million times better than any take-out/delivery near me.  Can't stop raving about it, it's been too long without GOOD chinese food!"}
{"text":"Had their orange chicken lunch special with extra broccoli & it wasn't horrible or the best thing ever."}
{"text":"do not order delivery hour and a half had to cancel"}
{"text":"Wonderful food I always order the House Lo Mein or the Singapore Rice Noodles, I like mine extra spicey. The House Fried Rice is great as well. The reason why I won't give this establisment 5 stars is the service. The lady that answer the phone is very rude and short ( she needs to learn about customer service) and she is very hard to understand. when delivering they need improving. Way too long and I live close by."}
{"text":"Who ever rated more than 1 start doesn't know real Chinese food! I regret spending a penny there. And also the staff and service are terrible how do these people even gave a job."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since they opened the doors... The food is consistently good. The staff is always receptive regardless of how busy they may be. I usually ask for a couple of specific changes to a dish and they've gladly accommodated my requests. They're pricing is appropriate and fair for the portion size. It's rare today. Help to support their business."}
{"text":"Egg rolls are above average. Entrees are decent and of good consistency, but lack great flavor.  Food quality doesn't match the slightly high price."}
{"text":"I've had their food twice before but this time around was terrible. The potstickers / fried dumplings were burnt. There was no chicken in the chicken fried rice. The shrimp was under cooked in the shrimp fried rice. And the service is terrible. They're extremely rude and subtly racist. Won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Found a HAIR in my food!! Called them and spoke with the front desk guy -I think his name is Ryan. Said he would credit my cc. 5 days later stll no credit. Called and ask for the mgr's name. He said \"it's none of your business what her name is...\"  I had to go there to demand my money back. He not only lost me as a regular customer but my entire work crew.  What a disgusting place!"}
{"text":"Yuck! This place must stay open because people are too drunk or lazy to drive. I got the General Tsos chicken and it was fried to a crisp. So much that I could hardly tell if if was chicken. Kinda like chewing rubber. I'll never order from here again."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery. It got to us within the time quoted, but they did not send our fried rice.  The food was mediocre. We ordered teriyaki chicken, chicken lo mien, egg rolls, and a spicy beef dish. The beef and noodles were good. The meat was dry though. A bit pricy for the quality of product."}
{"text":"Been going here for years for sitdown and takeout...it's always a treat! They will always cater to whatever you want and their tea is great. Nice lunch specials and quiet atmosphere. Can someone fix the name spelling on this page though?"}
{"text":"If I good give them zero stars I would. Ordered crispy beef and it was far from crispy and I had a hair inside of one of my dumplings. I called the store and the lady told me I was ungrateful and they can't do anything. Cold food, rude employees and shitty food. Don't waste your time on this dump."}
{"text":"This place is literally just down the road from me. I can order online too, which is really beneficial for someone who has some issues calling others on the phone.  Tonight I ordered Hot & Sour soup, spring rolls, and shrimp with vegetables. I asked them to sub in some garlic sauce too. My friend ordered the wonton soup and chicken mein fun.   To start, the Hot & Sour soup was exactly that - hot and sour. It was a little less sour than I expected and a lot more hot, but it was still very good, in my opinion! I ate almost all of the soup before I remembered I had other things to eat.  The person I went with didn't say much about the wonton soup, but the wontons were gone - so I'm guessing it was good!  The spring rolls were deep fried, which is something I'm not used to. They were greasy and soggy - I'm not a fan at all. I won't order the spring rolls again.   Luckily....  The shrimp and veggies were delicious. I absolutely loved the portion size too - the small is just the perfect amount of food. The veggies are a little on the crunchy side, which is amazing for me, but might be an issue for someone else who likes softer veggies. There was broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, bok choy, snow peas, celery and zucchini. The garlic sauce is spicy but not overwhelmingly so, and full of flavor. I could live off this stuff.  The chicken mei fun was very good, too, but my friend added soy sauce. Then again, he would put soy sauce on a shoe and eat it. Either way, he did taste it first and he did like it!  Overall, this was a great meal, although I definitely won't order those spring rolls again. The delivery was also very fast and everything arrived at a great eating temperature - not too hot or cold.  I recommend these guys, at least based on what I ordered!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite beef with garlic sauce. Yummy~ Singapore mein fun is good too. I ordered this for delivery and it was quick just 30 minutes wait. Definitely will order from here again."}
{"text":"Awful...lunch was served on plastic take-out plates with plastic spoons and forks!  Food was soooo mediocre.  No table service and the machine was out of iced tea AND ICE!   They brought us ice in a cup from the back.   This was their Grand Opening no less!  I will not be back!  There are so many Chinese restaurants nearby with good food and decent table service.    This place is a joke!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from China Jade around five times. There are some things on the menu that are great and there are some things that I didn't really care for. This review isn't about the food as much as the service. As many times as I've come here the food has never been ready in a reasonable amount of time, 30-40 minutes minimum for pick up.    But I get it it's a mom-and-pop store and so I don't mind those things. However I can't stand it that when I get there they often realize they haven't cooked some of my food and I have to wait some more. Tonight I just decided to walk out and told the lady it wasn't right for her to just say sorry; not enough.  So goodbye... at least for now."}
{"text":"We are always looking for an old school Chinese restaurant and this may be our new favorite.  Great wonton soup!  Loved the egg rolls, spring rolls even the ribs (a little tough but good flavor not to sweet).  They need some music though since every word you speak is a part of the next tables conversation."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese food I've had. I remember this place whenI was growing up in Cleveland,  and it's still there.  So good in fact,  we travel from Medina to get it. Something about their egg roles.  They are so delicious!! My fav is the sweet & sour chicken. Hubby gets Pepper Steak or General Tso Chicken. Our daughter lives in Ashland and misses our trips to China Jade. It's definitely comfort food. Helpings are generous in size. We've taken friends here and all have just loved their food. Service is always good, friendly people. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"It was good, but sadly they have NO CHOW MEIN and I really wanted to pig out on classic chinese takeout. The noodles were a little dry and the verge of being too salty. But overall not too shabby"}
{"text":"I crave this place. Awesome prices. Awesome authentic food.  We live about 15 miles away but we are willing to drive out of our way.  I have gotten sweet-and-sour pork, shrimp and broccoli, egg foo yong, orange chicken and they were all excellent. The fried rice it comes with is very good too. I think you should ignore the low ratings because this place is really good."}
{"text":"OMG!  This is teh best Chinese place in the valley.  Why?  B/c they deliver, obvi!  Plus, they put extra effort in photoshoping green bits onto they're take out menu -  Green bits go particularly well with fried shrimp and wontons.    Pro Tip:  General Tso's Bean Curd."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here and they were very quick. I ordered sweet and sour chicken with no sweet and sour sauce and instead I wanted the garlic brown sauce. They gave me the sweet and sour instead of the brown sauce. Normally I don't complain about things because I have worked in a restaurant all my life but this mistake meant I couldn't eat any of my food. It doesn't sound like a big deal but it was crucial to my meal. And when I'm paying for something I want it how I ordered it. So I called the restaurant to inform them of their mistake and they argue with me saying I ordered brown rice not sauce (when I ordered and received white rice...), after realizing there mistake they insist on delivering an order of brown sauce...I waited and waited for the sauce that never showed up. Now I'm stuck with freezing cold soggy Chinese food that I cannot eat and that I paid $16 for. DISPLEASED TO SAY THE LEAST. Will never order from here again.  Also I just called the restaurant to see if I could get a refund or a credit and the MANAGER argued with me, saying he never sent the sauce over and refused to comply. He also began yelling at me which I responded with, enjoy reading my review on yelp. Goodbye.  They were beyond rude and not helpful."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good especially for the price.  Have yet to have something I didn't like.  Lunch special is a large portion with soup or spring rolls, always a plus.  Definitely recommend trying"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a go-to Chinese takeaway on this side of town, but had been scared off from most of the contenders due to bad ratings. In the case of China Jade, I'm glad I took a chance and placed my order in spite of mixed reviews online.  I call the number. A garbled young voice picks up and says something not quite intelligible. I announce I want to place a take out order. He says HANG ON, followed by a clunk as the receiver is set on the counter. When he comes back, I place my order (Medium Hunan Shrimp, as listed on the menu, is repeated back as Small Hunan Shrimp).  I ask if they make their Hunan Shrimp with broccoli.  \"HANG ON\" *clunk* *background shouting: MA! DOES THE GARBLE GARBLE BROCCOLI GARBLE*  *Mom shouting back*  The kid told me 10-15 minutes for pickup, and yes, it has broccoli. (Then he asks - you like broccoli?)  This is a family run place.   Their young son was designing a video(?) game in between taking orders on the phone when I arrived to pick up, and I saw what had transpired with me repeat in person:   \"HANG ON\" *clunk* *kid runs around the counter to get something to write with* Presumably customer on phone asks question:  \"HANG ON\" *clunk*  *shouting: MA, WHAT DOES SMALL SESAME CHICKEN COST??*  To be honest it was all pretty charming. When he was done taking the order he wanted to tell me all about the game he was designing.  My food was ready pretty quickly. There was a little mixup where the mom thought I had ordered chicken (mom rolled her eyes at kid, kid insisted: \"I said SHRIIIIMPPPP\"), so she apologized and they remade it with haste.  The food: good! For the small/medium order, there is a *lot* of it. Plenty of fresh veggies - (chinese cabbage, broccoli, baby corn, carrots, onions), good flavor to the sauce (I might prefer a bit more spice-heat), 5 large shrimp and two big scoops of white rice. The egg drop soup was pretty standard, just broth and eggs, but not too salty, which is a pleasant change from some places. I can see sending Husband out to pick up a quart of the stuff next time I come down with a cold.  Prices are slightly higher than what is listed on their website - probably just an outdated menu - but not enough to matter since everything is so cheap anyway. My meal - a TON of food that I could not finish - was just over $8 before tip, and next time I probably wouldn't get soup since I know just how much is in the regular \"small\" size order.  All in all, I'm really glad to have given China Jade a shot, and I'm sure I'll be coming back with frequency in the future."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! The food here is great and the customer service is awesome! I recommend the curry chicken!!!!! Eat rolls, delicious!! Singapore mein fun is my best though!"}
{"text":"Absolute worst orange chicken I have had in my life. It was essentially a pile of sticky fried bread with 4 broccoli florets. More like nasty monkey bread than any kind of Asian cuisine. Couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"Just ordered from China Jade for the first time today. Was a delivery order and took about 45 minutes to arrive... about what I expected. Started un-boxing everything (which was packed well).   I had ordered the Beef Egg Foo Young... I found that all they believe the dish is the Egg Patties and the Brown Sauce. Everywhere else I've ever had the dish it also came with Slices of Beef, Snow Peas, Mushrooms, and Water Chestnuts. I was very disappointed to say the least. Gave it a try, and was not overly thrilled with the flavor... it was \"OK\" but nowhere near \"Good\".  Moved over to my appetizers, which I had ordered the Fried Dumplings and an Egg Roll. The Fried Dumplings were soggy, and tasted doughy. The Egg Roll was actually decent... crisp shell and good flavor.  Overall, I'm disappointed. Only reason I didn't give it 1 Star is because the food was (barely) edible and I didn't get sick from it... and the decent Eggroll."}
{"text":"I order delivery from here often.  The orders are always correct and the food is great."}
{"text":"For starters I'm not from Tempe so when I was hungry at lunch and knew I wouldn't be able to eat a dinner at a specific time, I knew Chinese food would cover me.  So ... Food is decent enough. Not greasy. Kung Pao Chicken is tingling on the tongue and the chicken is actually nice strips (hand cut?) Cut back on the carrots. Its called Kung Pao not Kung Carrot.  Cleanliness ... Yes it is clean in here. They have free wi-fi which is cool.  Amount of food ... less than I expected, but I'm sure my wife and waistline thanks you :-)"}
{"text":"Super fast delivery. The small boneless spare ribs were awesome. Big portion of them. Everything else seemed good. Pretty good Chinese food for Arizona."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, living in desert ridge doesn't leave you with to many Chinese take out options. Pricing seemed very fair, and the menu has a great selection. Delivery took an hour which is understandable, my house was built in 2012 and doesn't show up on google maps yet.  -General Tso's chicken was disappointing.  -they forgot our chow mien! -Kung pao beef was fantastic! -chicken egg rolls were good. (but I ordered spring rolls)  Sorry for the 2 stars China Jade, but you guys still owe me some chow mein... How dare you!"}
{"text":"Food is ok for American fast Chinese food. Usually get the same thing. Grade is always 95 or above. Kid takes orders sometimes; acts too much like a grown up for me."}
{"text":"The packaging was great! Nothing spilled out and the quality was good , unfortunately I've been spoiled with good Chinese food my whole life ... this place was very bland  I was disappointed with the noodles , fried rice  orange chicken was just okay and the vegetables were good, they still had a bit of a crunch rather than being over cooked and soggy . All in all ... my ventures to find my favorite Chinese place around here continue . Must be the water in Arizona  but it really is difficult to find a good Chinese place out here."}
{"text":"Best Chinese Food in town.  Very reasonably priced and very friendly staff. My recommendation is Sweet and Sour chicken"}
{"text":"Decent. I wasn't a huge fan of their egg rolls- they had a peppery taste. My other complaint was that the driver was smoking a cigar and didn't get out of the car- he just sort of handed me the box through the window. Weird.  The beef & broccli, orange chicken, and lo mein were good. (Don't judge me for our extremely basic order.) I did feel like it there was a little bit too much sauce but it wasn't terrible.   I will continue my quest for best Chinese in Arziona- it seems harder than it should be."}
{"text":"Ate a quick lunch here the other day and basically breezed in and out of the place in less than 40 minutes as hubby and I were in \"errand mode.\"   When we first walked in I immediately wanted to leave because it was dark, not inviting looking and only two diners were in there eating what looked like very small lunch portions. My hubby insisted we were committed so there was no turning back.  If you're looking for a fancy sit down place where you spend a lot of time perusing a menu or trying to decide what to eat, know that this is not the place. The cashier was also our hostess and waitress and when I asked what was included in the lunch special I could barely understand what she was saying. Thank goodness there were a whole stack of menus at the counter so I could figure out what the lunch special was all about.  We both ordered the Kung Pao special as it's our go to first order in any Chinese place as we know that if they can't make that correctly, it would be downhill from there. Within 10 minutes of sitting down our lunch arrived and it was nice and hot. Our lunch special came with either soup and eggroll and the main event of rice and kung pao chicken.  The only thing strange was how the portions were doled out.  My hubby had a generous amount of chicken and peanuts and my order did not. In fact, my lunch special was unfortunately mostly water chestnuts with baby corn and other veggies sprinkled around. The kung pao sauce was decent but I barely had three spoonfuls of chicken. Rather then complain as we were short on time, I ate half the order of fried rice and then took the rest of the rice to go.  My hubby said his order was decent but as for me, I left hungry and grumpy. Still searching for our to go Chinese and really wish there would of been consistency in the portions."}
{"text":"Decent enough, I would return. Definitely more friendly for takeout/delivery than dining in."}
{"text":"General tso chicken vegetable lo Mein and cheese/crab wontons was an amazing dinner that had been delivered to my personal apartment within a half hour, Giving the chicken curry, steamed dumplings and of course the lo Mein again was a great decision on a lazy Sunday. Using Grubhub.com, the deliver time was cut in half almost with an estimated time of 40 minutes. Try this place!!! They don't cut corners"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed and neither was my family. The food was bland and my sesame chicken had no chicken, just breading. The only thing I was impressed by was the fact that they delivered before they said they would."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  The guy, John, who took my order was a rude prick.  Never even got the food.  Do NOT order from this establishment!"}
{"text":"China Jade has easily the best lunch and dinner specials in Scottsdale. It still doesn't hold a candle to Dragon Express down in Mesa (best Chinese in Arizona), but can't go wrong for the price. All the employees are friendly and they are pretty fast with orders. Absolutely check it out if you want some fast food Chinese that is above Panda Express."}
{"text":"I tried this place last week and it was pretty good. Chinese delivery is always \"ok\" but I was very happy with the service and food. I unfortunately don't think any delivery Chinese food will ever be 5 stars. :( The food got here in a reasonable amount of time and was exactly what I wanted. I will be ordering from here again when I'm not in the mood to go out."}
{"text":"Chinese food. The options are always numerous. So today, when my youngest wanted Chinese for lunch, I pondered the situation. High end Chinatown food? Not today. Asian Buffet? No..standing in line to watch 300 of my fellow suburbanites waddle to the trough in the Temple of Excess holds no appeal (also it's shorts and sandals weather and...no. Just...no.). So what's in the middle?  My parents called it \"hole in the wall Chinese\"'. This isn't a reflection on the owner or the sanitary conditions or food quality...it just described for us the standard Chinese restaurant and carryout, booths and four tops, paper placemats with the Chinese Zodiac...classic strip mall Chinese restaurants, the kind you grew up eating in. And this brought us straight to China Jade, a perfect representation of your workaday Chinese restaurant. Daily lunch and dinner combos, good food, good prices. For $20 plus tax and tip, two big portions, shrimp chow mein and sweet and sour pork, fried rice, eggroll and soft drinks. About $25 with tax and tip, great flavor. A meal's worth of leftovers going home. As it was in the 80s, is now and ever shall be, \"hole in the wall\" Chinese is there for you at China Jade."}
{"text":"This is my family's go to place for Chinese food take out. If you miss east coast Chinese food, this is the closest you'll find in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I love this place over all other Chinese places in the area, hands down.  The portions are huge, and I have never had a dish I have not liked from there. I adore the yu shan eggplant, being a vegetarian. It's a great dish not available in many restaurants. They are prompt and always courteous."}
{"text":"This place is near where I work, so I decided to give it a try for lunch. The first thing I noticed is that the floor was very sticky, as if someone did not know how to properly mop it; it looked fairly clean.   I ordered the Szechuan Chicken to go.  The person at the register did not ask for my name, and when the order was done, there was no call out of a ticket/receipt number.     When I got back to work I found that the plastic carry out container was in a brown paper bag, which had been stapled closed.  There was not any plasticware, nor napkins.  The container was too small for the amount of food in it, and everything was smushed together.  The chicken had a very strange consistency.  It was very smooth, and much too soft.  It did not seem as though I were eating real chicken.  The food in general was very bland.  The brown rice was the only slightly redeeming feature of the meal.  I ended up throwing away most of the food.  I have eaten at a number of Chinese places, and this place ranks among the lowest in terms of food quality and taste.  I will not eat there again."}
{"text":"Was going to subway, but when I parked I saw this place and new it was fate. The staff was very friendly and the kitchen was open so you could actually see them cooking your food. I got my usual crab rangoons and spicy tso's chicken with chow mein.  All of it was delicious! Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Good selection, cheap prices, and fast service. I usually call in or order online for pick up and no matter how fast I get there, I never have to wait. Delivery is fast too, with a low minimum order cost. China Jade is a good go-to for a lazy night in."}
{"text":"Delivery was fast!  Placed an order at work for the office so a few dishes were ordered.  Beef Chow Mein (was ok but a little dry), Boneless Spare Ribs (flavorful but a bit chewy), Fried Rice (was great), Steamed Rice (was great), Won Ton Soup (was good), Hot & Sour Soup (was ok) & Spring Rolls (were good).    Was a bit disappointed that with this delivery being made to an office, they didn't bother to give us any forks, chopsticks or napkins.  For the whole order, we were given 3 soy sauce packets.  All in all...it was okay and the prices were decent."}
{"text":"Food, Atmosphere and Service was great. Disappointed that the Sweet & Sour Chicken did not come with the traditional pineapple chunks, carrots and green peppers."}
{"text":"A group of us ordered 5 takeout dishes from here this weekend and set it up buffet style for people to grab. Every single dish was amazing!! Great food in general."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food. We always get delivery and it comes on time. It's not the best I've had but it's defiantly good and worth getting for delivery."}
{"text":"Great little place for lunch.  Nothing fancy, but the food is ggod.  Prices are really good. Will try take for dinner and see how that goes."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the first time while running some errands. It's small, not really a sit-down type place, more takeout style.  They have a few tables if you want to sit and eat.   The Staff was friendly and the service was fast. I had the Garlic Beef which came with a spring roll. There were lots of veggies and a good amount of beef and rice, more than I should have ate in one sitting.  I'd stop again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"If you want a lot of food but not with a lot of flavor this is the place for you . I came in for the lunch special and I got the Kung Pao Shrimp, brown rice, and wonton soup. While it is a good price for everything; it didn't come with a lot of punch to it. My girlfriend ordered the beef and broccoli with fried rice. I liked that better than my Kung Pao Shrimp but overall it was just average. The restaurant was kept pretty clean which was a plus for me."}
{"text":"been stopin into the jade for YEARS!!! good stuff!! the sweet n sour pork with spicey noodles is one of my favorites!! great wonton soup..and the family dinners are also very good! good daily specials as well!!"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery. Cold when it got here later that grub hub said. And no eating utensils or napkins. I don't know if the bland and tasteless food we got was because it was cold when it got here or not. Probably never again."}
{"text":"Moo Shu Pork is delicious and flavorful. My girlfriend loves the General Tso's Chicken. The online ordering system on their website is impeccable.   Ordered twice from here now, once delivery and once pick up. Delivery took awhile because they were busy and the delivery guy got lost in our apartment complex (which I don't blame him for that). But I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite go to restaurant for take out!  Vegetables are always fresh and cooked just right.  They always put plenty of meat in the orders.  Delivery is always fast and our orders are always correct.  After  two years of living in Phoenix and trying multiple different places, we always go right back to China Jade!"}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite Chinese.   We bring our friends and family here and everyone we have introduced has come back on their own (even from Akron and Westlake).  We love the General Tso's.  My husband asks for extra spicy, and I love it as is.  Service is always friendly and I swear they remember my husband and bring him extra spicy mustard.  You can't beat the quality. I don't understand the complaints."}
{"text":"Called in for a take out last night.   Pros: Servers greeted me with a smile!:) The portion is good for what you paid for. Especially the wonton soup, $2.50 for a big cup with at least 8 pieces of wonton. My order was all packed and ready to go when I got there. The food quality was average.   Cons: the place was empty for a Sunday night. I did not fully understand the menu so I called in and asked the server for differences between their dishes. I could tell that the girl who took my order try to explain to me about their dishes but I was still confused after her explanation. So I ended up ordering a vegetable dish thinking that it was stir-fry noodles. Oh well, I know better for next time!   Overall, average. I would settle for this place if it was late during the day (especially on a Sunday night) and all I want is some affordable Chinese takeout/delivery in my tummy. I would suggest to maybe include some pictures of different dishes on the menu for those who aren't familiar with Chinese cuisines."}
{"text":"We've been eating at this other Chinese restaurant and food was so-so. We decided to order from China Jade for delivery and ordering was fast and the person who took our order was polite. The food came sooner than expected, and they were delicious! We got shrimp in garlic sauce (big shrimps!), mongolian beef and egg drop soup and they were all so tasty. We're sticking to China Jade for our Chinese food fix."}
{"text":"After reading reviews on Yelp, I decided to give them a try. Using Yelp I placed an order-- which connects you to the EAT24 app. I was able to view the whole menu and pay online. Loved this feature!  My food arrived within the suggested time. For Chinese takeout, it's pretty good! I had the Hunan Chicken and an Egg Roll."}
{"text":"Tried China Jade for the first time yesterday. The food is delicious. Well at least the House Fried Rice and Hot and Sour Soup were delicious. I love the ability to order online and pop in to pick up and pay. I'll be back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Eating this as I type. Delivery was faster than they said (est. 50, came in 25). Food is really good and fresh. No suspicious shaped food like a lot of Chinese places. Egg rolls are A+. Eat this."}
{"text":"I have been ordering their take out a few times now, very cost effective and excellent food. Great experience"}
{"text":"Food is prepared quickly, tasty, and portion sizes are generous."}
{"text":"Every time I order from here I forget that it's not that great. I just hate Panda Express so I resort to this place. It's kind of gross inside and the staff is boring. The menu is very plain. I got tofu... it was soggy, of course. I have to dump soy sauce on the fried rice to get any flavor out of it. The food is severely lacking flavor and their pricing is a little ridiculous. Oh, and they don't have enough details on the menu and given that the cashiers don't speak much English, it's near impossible to know exactly what you're ordering.  I'd skip this joint."}
{"text":"I left a rib, actually threw it away.   If you know me - that could pretty much be the end of my review, you would get the gist.   This was an order for delivery. I will say that I ordered through the Yelp app and it was super easy and the food was here in no time.   I got:  Small (4) BBQ Ribs $5.99 Fried Dumplings (8) $5.99 Shrimp Chow Fun $8.99  The ribs were dry and had the tough consistency of old ribs, with a lot of sauce on them to try and revive them.   The dumplings were very thin skinned, not much filling and also tasted like they had been reheated. I left 3 of those  The Chow Fun was why I ordered from this place instead of several others that I looked at on Yelp. My son used to order this and I would always steal some. So I've been craving it and not many places have it. Their version was bland. The shrimp were too small and tasteless.   I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"Definitely Chinese worth buying. Every Chinese place I've tried usually taste like bad or spoiled something, not at China Jade. I ordered the beef Mongolian and Kung Pao Shrimp. The Kung Pao Shrimp was different from my norm but still good and definitely worth it. Thank God I found a Chinese place I can trust"}
{"text":"Very good Chinese takeout food. Friendly staff. I go there a couple of times a month. Never had an issue."}
{"text":"I used to live across the street from here but we still ordered delivery.  They are a sorely missed chinese place, as we now live across town and don't get it anymore.  The chinese places we frequented before and after pale in comparison.  Name it on their menu, we've tried it and loved it.   I personally have never cared for egg rolls.  I don't know why.  But the egg rolls from this place?  I loved them.  I wish every place made them like these guys do."}
{"text":"Egg rolls, beef/broccoli and pork lo mein were all delicious!! Quick service and cheap prices!"}
{"text":"I wish Tempe had some decent chinese food!  Fried Rice was basically white rice with vegetables. Egg rolls were deep fried but soggy.  Hot and Sour soup was flavorless.  Will not order again."}
{"text":"Ordered orange soda got a fiesta ? Was warm and gross.. Chicken was cheap the pnly good part of the meal was soup. I'll try another place next time..."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and was in search of a new chinnese place. This place is delicious. We ordered mongolian beef, chicken lo mein, sweet and sour chicken, and egg rolls. My only complaint is the sweet and sour chicken comes with sauce on the side and no veggies, making it pretty bland. Everything else was delicious!"}
{"text":"Ordered some sweet and sour chicken and some soups. The person on the phone was easy to give the order to and the delivery time (although it took a little while) was decent enough.   I live in a gated community which can be a hassle when getting delivery but the delivery boy was able to follow directions well and got in without any hassle.   My family is down for getting delivery from them again, very acceptable food quality and okie dokie experience. Would recommend to others :)"}
{"text":"We came here last evening and not much has changed.   Yep, the phones are still ringing, but it seems less crazy. This is a family operation, with the kids doing their homework on some back tables.   The food is not bad, just a tad simple for my taste. I've taken a few updated photos, but in the future we'll just order out.   3 1/2 Stars, A-Okay."}
{"text":"I can't decide if I like this place more than hunan express or not..  Comes in good portions for a good price, also the containers are convenient, sometimes I use them as Tupperware! I obviously use them for lunch to work the next day.  I love their egg drop soup, &lemon chicken but the shrimp in lobster sauce  with fried rice or shrimp mein fun are my favorites.  I always call for pick up and they usually say 10 or 15 mins & a lot of the time I'll come a couple mins earlier &my food is always ready waiting on the side for me. I've never had an issue with them. I eat there atleast twice a month &the food has been really hot &tastes good and they're always generous w the amount of food!  Update: I've had vegetable mein fun(noodles are very thin &sooo good.) the vegetable soup and seafood soup are good but the seafood soup is just vegetable soup w seafood in it so I would recommend just getting  the seafood soup incase u can't decide. They also give a nice amount of wonton crackers w each soup."}
{"text":"Meh is all I can say... I ordered online for delivery. Why can't North Scottsdale get a good Chinese place with easy delivery?"}
{"text":"I tried China Jade for the first time tonight and... WOW. pricing is comparable to other places in the area, but the quality of food and flavor is far superior. the only downside here is the small selection of appetizers, but that didn't bother me one bit.   Egg rolls: large, basic flavor Cheese puffs: with a bit of green onion, they weren't bad General tso chicken: crispy and sweet. Very sweet. But WOW that is a ton of meat for a combo meal! A few pieces of broccoli, not 2 cups of soggy veg as you'd expect.The steamed rice was sticky, which is just how I like it. And ....  HOUSE SPECIAL LO MEIN (cue singing angels) I got a \"small\" portion, which I found could be a meal unto itself. At least 4 pieces of juicy shrimp, large pieces of white meat sweet chicken, and the best BBQ pork pieces that were so flavorful, and so tender, I could not believe it was take out. The sauce was perfect for me. This is my new favorite and I will definitely be ordering here again!!"}
{"text":"Super fast delivery!  Egg drop soup was very tasty and cheap.  We ordered chow mien, kung pao beef and cashew shrimp as well.  The flavor of the shrimp was incredible and the veggies were crisp and very fresh.  Very large portions so we'll have this for lunch tomorrow as well.  Very convenient and was about 20 minutes from order to delivery.  Much better than Panda or Pei Wei and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food isn't very good - service is worse. Crab Rangoon is soggy. Egg rolls are greasy and flavorless.   Restaurant owner is rude & doesn't speak English very well - often misunderstands orders and then when it is brought to their attention they refuse to correct it. Accusing the customer of misspeaking."}
{"text":"Very helpful when ordering, polite and willing to please. We ordered a whole mess of food which they said would be ready in 20 minutes, and it was ready to go upon arrival. The restaurant  is very clean and what you would expect of a mom and pop operation. Service was prompt food was hot and packed well. The containers are the nice reusable ones that are black on the bottom and clear in top. These are great to take with you to work so your significant other doesn't get mad at you when the \"good\" Tupperware doesn't come home. Sometimes you get gipped when you get takeout cause the containers are not full. These are overflowing and packed with love. All of my guests were wicked happy with the taste and quality of the food. I cannot wait to come back to Scottsdale to get some grub from here again."}
{"text":"Have been in sort of a Yelp doldrum lately, just trying to find my footing in life, generally. On Good Friday, my family fasts, and then we order a bunch of Chinese, while cooking for Easter. This year, I was the hostess, and made a wise, random decision in choosing China Jade.   The photos don't do justice to how tasty the food was: my favorites were the Ma Po Tofu, Shrimp Egg Foo Young, and Salt & Pepper Shrimp. Because the fam doesn't Yelp! I missed out on pic of House Special Chow Fun (33) @$9.50, and large Wonton Soup (9) @$2.95 which were very good, too. Being such a large order, we had an option of FREE Orange Chicken (H4) which is usually $10.55: it is a dish I usually never eat, but hubs convinced me to try it: surprisingly tasty, not greasy, and the sauce was spicy & not gloppy at all. Color me pleasantly surprised. Everyone loved the fried & white rice, wish they had brown as an option.   Delivery was very quick, polite, and efficient. They even threw in a few egg rolls with the order on the house.   We will absolutely order from them again, as quality, value, and speed of delivery motivated me from my 'slump' finally having found our new take out jam."}
{"text":"Best Chinese delivery. The spring rolls are amazing and I highly recommend the Dragon & Phoenix. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"The food was over 20 minutes late, cold and subpar. They get 2 stars for being cheap. Will not order again with so many other places to choose from. Plenty of mixed reviews so this place must be hit or miss. It was a miss for me."}
{"text":"So good and not greasy! my co workers love it and I am happy they are close to my work and home. Also, the prices are right! check it out :)"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed. I ordered for delivery 2 lunch specials and a 2liter soda. The delivery driver forgot the soda. The lunch specials said they came with rice and soup or a spring roll. We only got the rice. There was hardly any meat. And when you order from a Chinese restaurant, fortune cookies are expected. We got none. For $20, this was ridiculous. Don't think I'll be eating here again."}
{"text":"I really like their coconut shrimp! And their rice is not terrible like everywhere else! Very yummy!"}
{"text":"Attempted to order online. I called after 10...and they couldn't find my order. I attempted again with the Yelp order and  after another 15 minutes  they could find my order because they hadn't put it in.  After waiting an Hour...I got a confirmation that my Food would be delivered in \"45 minutes\". Thanks. But please cancel my order and refund my 2x processed payment of $32.something. Really poor service Yelp and China jade"}
{"text":"This place is a joke! I was visiting from out of town! Ordered food for delivery and gave them my credit card number 6 times! Unreal then they take the wrong number and send one of there goons to collect from us! GET THIS they take the wrong number again! Then text me they are calling the police! PERECT call them its not my fault they can't understand english! Also the food is sub par! Who sticks a menu on someones door to get new guests then treats them like shit! Wake up china jade and get your shit together!"}
{"text":"If I could do 2 1/2 starts I would.  I ordered here for lunch one day, as they deliver and I was the only one at work so I couldn't leave to grab food. There is a minimum $15 dollar order for delivery order as well as a $1.50 delivery charge. This isn't bad considering the low min. order amount, however, their menu prices are so cheap that you end up buying a lot of food to meet the $15 minimum. This was alright thought, because leftovers (especially Chinese) are always nice.  Anyhow, I ordered the chow mein lunch special with fried rice and won-ton soup, an additional order of chow mein, an order of spring rolls and and order of chicken with snow peas and mushrooms. The guy on the phone stated that it would be about 45 mins to an hour. This is a little above the average delivery time, but I figured that because they're a small, local business that it was somewhat reasonable.  Needless to say, about an hour later the delivery boy came and dropped off the food. He was nice and clean, but awkward and quiet.  It was nice to see that I was given two boxes of white rice with the order as well. I first tried the white rice and it didn't taste like traditional steamed jasmine rices do. It almost had a nutty flavor to it and it was extremely greasy for a fried rice, which was pretty odd. It didn't taste bad by any means, but it was just unusual. The wonton soup was very average. One filled wonton and strips of rare beef (?) in a light broth. Nothing special. Spring rolls were okay, pretty standard for a fast-food-ish type Asian place. The lunch special was again just alright. Fried rice was pretty much just rice with the frozen-looking peas and carrots mixed in and the chow mein was pretty greasy. It was nice to see that the chow mein did in fact have a nice portion of veggies in it, even if they looked fresh-frozen. The most disappointing part of the meal was the chicken with the snowpeas and mushrooms. It came in a bowl packed-full to the top, but when I opened up the lid, there was some sort of sauce/juice filling half the bowl and the chicken and veggies were just soaking in it. This was very disappointing and made the dish rather unappetizing. I ended up throwing about 3/4 of it away.  Pros: Good price for portion ratio Delivery  Cons: Long delivery wait Sub-par quality food Minimum delivery charge  All in all, if you are looking for a quick/cheap place for delivery, China Jade is just ok. I would recommend nearby Red House instead. A little more pricey, but worth it for your tummy.  Photos of my food are posted."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I cruised YELP for reviews on Chinese take out and China Jade looked a like the best solution in our neighborhood and they hit a home run.  We ordered for 5 here at the office, order was ready when they said it would be, portions are great and the meals were terrific.  Today was the first of I'm sure many."}
{"text":"Very quick service, nothing special about this place. The food was very good but nothing to set it apart from the typical Chinese food joint. If you're looking for fast, hot, good food this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I have not eaten here. Just want to know what the reviewers think about my questions with this place. They left a menu taped to my door today. I was going to toss it because I have lived in districts with great authentic Asian food so my expectations are high and places that leave menus on doors usually cater to those who care about quantity and timeliness of receiving delivery rather than quality. I eat a vegetarian diet like many Asians. Is it worth my time and money? Or is it all rice and the American dish of sweet and sour chicken. Wish I could post something on my door saying do not leave a flier unless you have an assortment of quality vegan dishes that are authentic."}
{"text":"This is a family favorite for Chinese take out!!!!!!!!!! They never ever disappoint us.  Huge portions, great price, extremely tasty, very quick (although what Chinese restaurant isn't quick.....10min!)  I have been there to actually sit and eat twice and same quick service, great tasting........delicious!!!!!! I always I always get the sweet and sour chicken with an extra egg roll.....please! My mouth is watering!  :o)  check it out if you have not already."}
{"text":"I used to go here years ago and then stopped. Then a friend of mine said she was going there. so I decided to try them again. So the first time back when entering there was a awful smell, maybe wet carpet or the sewer?? The takeout food was good. I continued to visit once in awhile until a few weeks ago. I will never go there again!  I had a craving for the orange beef so I ordered that to take home. As I started to eat the beef and sauce had good flavor.  But then there was something I had to spit out onto my napkin. As I was thinking what was that? Then it happened again and then the worse reveal of all... pieces of toenail clippings. Some were large and there were also smaller pieces!!!!!. I am not kidding, that was what I was finding. Needless to say I lost what I had ate. So gross. They were not concerned about it and did not give me credit (not that I wanted any except a refund) but that was not offered. On some occasions you might wonder if is a roach leg or body piece in your fried rice which is also terrible but to think that someone actually put nail clippings on purpose into the food is really disgusting. Don't go there! I don't know why they are still in business.  I couldn't find any reviews on the Health Inspection site either which I found to be very strange since they have been in this location for a very long time."}
{"text":"Love their food! Lo mein, egg rolls, cream cheese puffs, I've not been disappointed with anything. Excellent prices, great delivery too."}
{"text":"Fast Chinese food, Extra Guilt included! But oh so good!  Theyre pretty quick on getting the orders out, and online ordering is cool.  The food is made fresh and very tasty, but you all know better!!!! I like coming here when i know i wont get caught! =D"}
{"text":"Thisn place is the TRUTH!!!! The most authentic tasting chinese that ive tasted in AZ.. THe orange chicken will change your life. They also have the best eggrolls Ive ever had and they are HUGE. Very affordable, the dinner combo is like $6.95.  Plus this place delivers.. THE BEST."}
{"text":"Chinese food is very subjective to taste.  The food here is very good and consisitent.  Usually Im part of group when eating here and take advantage of the family meals.  Meaning one entree per person, wonton soup, tempura shrimp, egg rolls, and mini bbq ribs at about $12/person.  The food is large porions and flavorful.  The fried rice has real pork and egg pieces in it!  The hidden menu item - War Su Gai - this is breaded chicken with brown gravy over lettuce.  May not sound jump off the menu great but it is!!  The staples of sweat and sour pork/chicken have really good sauce with carrot and pinneapple and pieces are good size not all breading.Pepper steak is actually has a lot of steak in it and is usually grisle free, good amount of green pepper in great sauce.  Shrimp egg fu young is served in two large patties and you will see shrimp not just pieces parts!    Oh yeah, the service is excellent.  Whether you eat there or take out time to prep food is pretty quick, without tasting like it was sitting around all day.  Ingredients always seems freshly prepared and made on site.  If you take food home ask for duck sauce in a cup!!  The take out packets are not the same and are best left behind!"}
{"text":"Ordered the sweet and sour chicken.  Sauce came on the side, no vegetables.  Lonnie got the shrimp egg foo young and again the sauce was on the side.  Not a fan of the sauce on the side. If they didn't use expensive containers maybe the would be better and food would be better. I'm disappointed with the lack of onions, peppers and pineapple."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service, fast and large servings! Good price, little pricy but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"China Chade has been a hit or miss for a while. Delivery boy asked for a bigger tip than the 10% I tipped him for the short drive on top of the fee already charged for delivery. Cold food, I've had better Chinese. I've thrown food away before. I understand everybody deserves their gratuity, but in a business you need to realize people are sensitive and can't always give much. So when someone doesn't give much, you need to respect that. I've never had someone ask for a bigger tip. Sadly not ordering from here again."}
{"text":"It's a good place to eat and I enjoy it however it's not my number one Chinese place to eat in the whole world. It's okay though if there's nothing else around you should try it"}
{"text":"Order from there tonite, they delivered to our condo and the food was excellent! Sesame chicken was lightly breaded, very tender and excellent flavor. Mongolian beef was delish not to spicey and tender beef. The rice with both dishes was excellent. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After reading mostly good reviews my GF and decided we'd give it a shot.  We ordered the kung pow beef, hot and sour soup, shrimp fried rice, crab wantons and orange chicken.  The beef was good... The hot and sour soup wasn't even edible... Shrimp fried rice was decent at best... Crab wontons were pretty good...  The orange chicken was dry and pretty nasty...  I wouldn't recommend this place. I will say however that the delivery was timely and the delivery guy was cheerful!"}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw that this place was open on Christmas Eve! I ordered the Szechuan chicken with brown rice and won ton soup. I decided  to save the fortune cookie until the end and told myself the fortune would be the icing on the cake for the year-2016. I devoured my food and opened my cookie and much to my dismay-NO FORTUNE! I know they probably buy their cookies from somewhere else but come on! It was Christmas and you stole my fortune.   Okay, that's not really why I deducted a star. The food came out quick and it was good. I've had better and I've had worse. I'd go back, next year, on Christmas Eve. Maybe."}
{"text":"YUCK! I ordered general Tsos, Mongolian beef and hot and sour soup. I used to like this place. It tasted like my food was 5days old. It definitely wasn't fresh. The hot and sour soup tasted like dirty muddy water with Siracha added to it to spice it up. The general Tsos chicken was disgusting. It was all breading and no chicken. The sauce they used was gross. My dogs wouldn't eat it. The only thing that was 1/2 decent was the Mongolian beef. It was edible but the beef was gummy. They made Panda Express look like a 5 star restaurant. I really think my food was prepared like several weeks ago and RE heated and served to me. Ughhhh...now I have to search for another Chinese take out place."}
{"text":"Wow really good!  Filling, fast, and yummy!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great for \"American Style Chinese\"  Eggroll and Sweet n Sour sauce are not to be missed.  My favorite dish is the Moo Goo Gai Pan!    Give it a try you will love it."}
{"text":"Average food. Good orange chicken, Mongolian beef, kung pao chicken and noodles with beef. V friendly staff. Took some time to get our food"}
{"text":"The delivery took a long time, but the food was decent. I got beef and broccoli combo with pork fried rice. While the food wasn't anything to write home about, it tasted good - especially the pork fried rice. The crab rangoons were especially tastey. I will definitely order from this place again."}
{"text":"The service was quick and efficient. I ordered my food and was able to pick it up in about 10 minutes. This was my first time ever trying China Jade and my meal was delicious. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Yummy in short.  We ordered egg rolls, steamed dumplings, chicken fried rice and beef and broccoli using the grubhub app.  The food arrived at our hotel quickly, hot and with all the sauces and silverware.  I was surprised on how good the food was, it was actually good.  Next time I'm visiting Tempe and too tired to eat out this will definitely be my first choice!"}
{"text":"Convenient and staff was friendly but food was affordable yet truly terrible. Inedible with little taste. Asian cooking should balance salty, sweet, sour and spicy. Maybe this was an attempt to cater to American palates. We ended up throwing it out. Phoenix seems to be a difficult city to find good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Good customer service.  The worst orange chicken I've ever had. I couldn't finish it.  I went in thinking it was the same place as the delicious China Jade in Tempe. Nope.   Again, the people are kind, but the food... I just can't..."}
{"text":"This is pretty good Chinese food at a reasonable price. And by pretty good, I mean better than any other order-and-be-finished-eating-within-a-half-hours-time Chinese restaurant that I can think of off hand. I ordered my favorite item, orange chicken, and would have to say it's far superior to Panda Express' and my previously reviewed China Red's. China Red gives much bigger portions, and although I left China Jade with no leftovers, I did leave feeling full, and completely satisfied. They throw in an egg roll and a fortune cookie, which is pretty standard, and I have no complaints with those items either."}
{"text":"We ordered the sesame chicken combo with lo mein. Nothing special, basic run of the mill Chinese food. It took them over an hour to deliver because they were \"very busy\" and we only live 10 min away. It's a ton of food though. So if you're looking to stuff your face with disregard to taste then this is your place."}
{"text":"I used to drop in here occasionally before it was China Jade. Nothing special, but not something to avoid either; just meh. Last week, I decided to check out the new place, and it's unrecognizable. The atmosphere is *way* nicer, the employees are friendly and polite (and totally willing to explain unusual menu items), and the food is amazing. I had the chow fun and was completely blown away. Definitely worth a return visit or three."}
{"text":"YUMMMMMM .. I've tried a few delivery spots in the area and NONE have pleased me until NOW! Veggie fried rice was my fav and the orange chicken was surprisingly good! It was still crispy a little and not all soggy! Beef broccoli was really good meat was excellent! And delivery was less than 30 minutes! Awesome!!"}
{"text":"General Tso chicken was like some \"weak-ass BBQ chicken\" instead of Gen Tso.  However, the mala green bean dish is really good."}
{"text":"Very clean mostly takeout Chinese.  Not super fresh.  Panda is fresher.  My daughter's beef was cold in the beef and broccoli  and we ate in!  Fried rice was even sub par.  I'm sticking with Nee House on the North side from now own, my excellent traditional go to spot."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. I order online and order something wrong. The restaurant called me to double check my order. Thanks"}
{"text":"I'm no Chinese connoisseur but I really enjoy the food and it's always chock full of fresh ingredients which is huge for take out. The owners are super sweet and the little girl will always talk to me. Very respectful and thankful for service. We were sad to move away from them."}
{"text":"AWFUL. I ordered from here today for the first and LAST time. After spending 60 dollars, I got sweet and sour chicken (which I despise) instead of sesame chicken, undercooked crab rangoon (2 orders of it), no 2 liter of coke (they forgot it), horrible spring rolls (teeny little veggie ones like you buy in the frozen food section), and soggy shrimp. I haven't had a delivery experience this bad in 3 years. Save yourself the time, energy, and money."}
{"text":"Went to China Jade last night and it was pretty bomb. The wonton soup was so so but the sesame chicken, shrimp with broccoli, moo shu pork and chicken with cashew was as good as flos and Jade Palace . I would definitely eat here again. They were easy to order from the delivery driver was clean and nice and the entrees were delicious. My only complaint would be for them to add more things to the won ton soup such as vegetables, shrimp and pork. Their won ton chips which come free with the meal definitely need to be redone and come with sweet and sour sauce. Don't expect anything fancy inside the restaurant it is more Panda Express then flos"}
{"text":"We had Beef Lo Mein to go,  Portion was small, flavor was not good at all."}
{"text":"I have ordered from them through GrubHub several times. Very Fast & I am NOT close. Steam dumpling are hot & fresh. Chicken Fried Rice is perfect with large chucks of Chicken. My favorite work lunch delivery spot."}
{"text":"Vegetables, specifically the celery, is always a little tough. But being just around the corner from where I work, it will definitely do when I've got a craving for Chinese food. The fact that they will deliver,.. Done deal.  Three stars!"}
{"text":"Great service, great prices & great food, what more do you want?!  I've been eating here and ordering take out for the past 10 years and I have yet to have a bad experience. Without a doubt the best low mein in Cleveland"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just ordered the orange chicken and lo mein and the chicken tasted like fish. The lo mein was okay..."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Chinese food in the valley! I really reminds me of Shanghai. Their twice cooked pork belly is the best I have found yet!!"}
{"text":"This was back from the beginning of May, but I wanted to transfer my review so it would be seen on here.   Ordered sweet and sour pork, sesame chicken and fried wontons. The order came a little earlier than the time frame, but the delivery guy was in such a rush that he almost left without his tip. Luckily for him, I'm honest and made site that he got it. I paid too much.  The food was lukewarm to start with. And the fried wontons were nothing like what I've had before, more like a crab wonton with too much meat.  In order to eat the pork, you had to let them soak in the sauce, which took too long for me. The sesame sauce was ok, nothing to brag about. I think the best thing was the fried rice, even with the chunks that were stuck together.   I will not be ordering from here again; I don't know how this place has such high ratings."}
{"text":"By no means is this place spectacular, but Kristine F., who complained about the use of plastic plates/utensils and the lack of table service, is a giant imbecile. Reading reviews like her's annoys me; she should be completely disregarded. It's a Chinese take-out/fast-food place!  I have been here twice now and have ordered Sesame Chicken, String Beans, Fried Rice, Fried Dumplings, and Wonton Soup. Keeping in mind that this is a Chinese take-out place, I still think they could do a better job with the food. For example, the Sesame Chicken did not have any crisp to it, but was just chicken with soggy batter; the wonton soup's broth was flavorless. I must say however, that this is one of the better take-out places in the North Scottsdale area. So if you are craving for cheap Chinese food, this may be it!"}
{"text":"Had two deliveries whilst on business travel- and they didn't add forks or napkins in each time- food was decent and soup was great!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. I've had the orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, general tso chicken, and the garlic chicken. All were amazing! The garlic chicken is amazing and has helped me get over the flu twice now. The amount of spice and garlic is perfect. Paired with egg drop soup, it helps out so much with any cold or flu. The cheese wontons are also great. Fast delivery every time I order too! I would highly recommend the lunch special as well because it's a great deal."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice since it's opened and have really enjoyed the food. I really can't think of a negative thing to say about it. The price is low, the portions are more than enough, and it's very fast. You can't really eat inside the restaurant--it's a pick-up and delivery kind of place. Haven't used delivery, so I can't review that aspect yet."}
{"text":"Had flight cancelled so airline put me up at a hotel so was forced to order in since nothing was walking distance. Found this place which looked OK, bad move. Ordered for delivery and it took 1hour to get there and they were 3.1 miles away. All food was cold. Ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce, Mongolian beef and the pan fried noodles.  Shrimp had about 5 shrimp decent size and filled with veggies. Mongolian beef had small strips of beef very in a I'd say water based broth and very bland. Noodles plained blew. Hard bland and just gross. This would be a 2star review if I was a vegetarian since that's what they fill their plates with. Top it off rice was mushy!  I called and just the language barrier was bad that whatever I said they repeated. I'm in AZ for work frequently and will not make this mistake again."}
{"text":"We always order our chinese food here now. I used to Pei Wei which hasn't been for a while. I noticed it since it is tucked in next the fitness center. Everyone is so nice there! And the food is great! Also, I like how they tell you the sauce, forks, etc is right on the counter and they say take much has you want. Most restaurants even Panda Express monitors and sometimes hid the condiments. Especially cheap Panda Express, they used to have it out but now you ask for it. A little thing like that goes a long way!"}
{"text":"After my food being delivered to the wrong house(twice), due to a google issue, the food was fairly bland. I do not blame the initial issue on the restaurant, but I do have an issue that 20 minutes after the food was delivered the the wrong house they did not even try to call me. I called once and was told they would call the driver and call me back. I tried calling 5 times and was never able to get through. I was fed up and decided to get food else where. On my way back I saw the delivery driver 2 doors down asking the neighbors to call me, even though I have never talked to them. When I talked tot the driver all he said was I gave him the wrong address and walked away. To be fair the driver was right and I do not blame him for my mistake, but the service from the restaurant and the driver was lacking a lot.  After all of this the food was pretty tasteless and the chow mein was just a white pile of dry chewy chicken. To sum up I did make a mistake not checking my address online but the situation was handled poorly after that."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD. Take out girl explained what a quart and a pint was. Would order more general tso chicken and Moo goo gai pan."}
{"text":"I love this place and wish I had found it sooner.  This is not a Chinese buffet or fast food; this is traditional Chinese cooking, made fresh to order and at a, really, reasonable price.    The first time I went, I ordered take-out and was pleasantly surprised to walk out with a full dinner entree for less than $10.00.  Once I got it home, I was incredibly pleased with the quality of the ingredients and the flavors of the dish.  I often get the Tiramisu for desert, as well.  I now order from here at least once or twice a week and am so happy to have such quality Chinese food, cooked fresh to order, at a really reasonable price, less than 2 miles from my home.  This is a traditional Chinese family owned restaurant and the owners are very nice.  I highly recommend you try the food and get to know the owners."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant!  Been coming here for 20yrs. The same people work here that worked here then !!  Delicious wonton soup!!   I love their shrimp chips"}
{"text":"This place is consistently great! Delivery is fast and the food is always hot when it arrives. They accidentally forgot our order of egg rolls last time, and I called the restaurant to let them know. The guy I spoke to said that he would note it for next time, if I called after I ordered (via GrubHub). Well, I ordered but I forgot to call, yet sure enough, there were the egg rolls on my next order! Awesome! Thanks, guys! (And the General Tso's tofu is delicious!)"}
{"text":"Inexpensive very good Chinese!  Open kitchen, no roaches...cleanliness cn be a big issue at Chinese take out places lets be honest...this place is clean and managed well....prices are very good and is excellent Chinese for Arizona....!"}
{"text":"It's a reliable standby for quick take out. I stick to the basics and have liked everything I've ordered so far. I would pick up before I ordered delivery--they were quoting 55+ minutes for delivery on a Saturday night. Also, you can ask for chili paste if you go in (kept behind the counter). Seems like a solid family run business, and it's refreshing to find Chinese food actually cooked by Chinese people."}
{"text":"Check your order before you leave. We ordered sweet & sour with sauce on the side. They forgot the sauce. When I picked up, I asked but did not check. They nodded yes.  I think they are just too busy to care. They offered to drop off the sauce at the house. This took two hours. Our meal was soggy by then."}
{"text":"Decide to try this place as I saw their menu at my work. I ordered the Chicken Lo Mein lunch special and was able to pick it up 10mins or so after I called and placed the order.  Place was small but open & clean. Food was good too. I even added their spring roll to my order and that is almost as good as Yogi's.  Definitely will go back and order from them again. One of my new favorite Asian fast food places to go for lunch."}
{"text":"Great General Tso tofu - I always get it extra spicy and extra crispy and they always do it right! Lo Mein is not greasy and has a large quantity of veggies!  Only downfall is that the woman is extremely hard to understand via phone and on weekend nights, the delivery is on the slow side (we had only 3 items, took 50 minutes Saturday night around 10pm)"}
{"text":"I am visiting in the area and found this on Yelp. It was a VERY good choice!!! Dinner special I got was the shrimp egg Foo young for $8.59 which included fried rice and egg roll...I have enough left for tomorrow as well. It was excellent!! Wish I lived closer... it's hard to find good Chinese in Phoenix area!! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Been going there for years. It used to be phenomenal, but it's still really good and better than average. They get a little complacent sometimes. Still worth a try for sure. Great egg rolls and won ton."}
{"text":"Food was AMAZING! I had the beef with broccoli and the sauce is excellent! Sweet and sour chicken is not worth $10, but the chicken was good. Highly recommend! However delivery took over an hour..... :("}
{"text":"Until now this is my favorite Chinese restaurant It's so simple but so delicious I highly recommend the curry chicken with noodles , so great :)))) Yes, they have a delivery though"}
{"text":"I've been trying to find similar tasting Chinese food to back home in Chicago with a few tweaks we were able to make it taste good. I definitely will try them again."}
{"text":"Bland fried rice. Overcooked Teriyaki Chicken. Soggy Eggrolls. NOTE, their Chicken \"CHOW MEIN\" does not include noodles, even though the very definition of the dish is \"fried noodle\". It's just a slop of chicken and onions."}
{"text":"We had the sweet & sour chicken & beef & broccoli delivered. When it arrived it was still too hot to eat. The driver brought it right to our hotel room."}
{"text":"There's some decent dishes to try here. They are in the Food City strip behind the bank. The mongolian chicken in a red spicy sauce is delicious with lots of thinly cut onions. The pork fried rice has plenty pork chunks. We haven't ventured outside typical 3-4 dishes but we keep coming back to some favs"}
{"text":"Great place to eat!!!! I was sitting at home craving Chinese and I saw this place on Yelp so I decided to try it out. I ordered the orange chicken combo with fried rice, Mongolian beef and BBQ spare ribs! Highly recommend it!! Very tasty food, the delivery was very fast and the pricing was great! Please try this place out if you're looking for really good Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Man this is some juicy food. Can't complain about the quality for take out or for dine in. I love hot mustard and they have little packets of it they give to you for free. Who said you can't get nothing for free these days? I got some hot mustard packets. And some damn fine lo mein noodles."}
{"text":"Not only is the food nowhere near as good as it used to be, but my boyfriend and I went inside to eat one night and received horrible service. I work in a restaurant so it takes a lot for me not to leave a tip, but I did not leave one and the waitress actually chased my boyfriend and I out of the restaurant demanding a tip! Here's your tip, give better service!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite \"Americanized\" Chinese Restaurant.  Everything is spot on.  My husband loves that the chicken dishes are tender pieces of Chicken Breast and not just some dried up pieces of...well, ya know...Service is always great as well."}
{"text":"My fiance and I ordered takeout from here. The only good thing was our food arrived earlier than anticipated.  The hot and sour soup was very bland and room temperature. The egg foo young was horrible. It had no flavor and the oddest vegetables in it. The fried rice tasted like styrafoam and the general tso's chicken was more like general tastes like shit chicken. My boyfriend got very sick after eating the chicken (I luckily refrained). Qwik Chinese Bistro at 90th St and Via Linda is amazing. I cant believe China Jade has not been shut down. Will never eat there again!  We would rather eat a cat's sack than eat at this place again."}
{"text":"I have ordered from them through GrubHub several times. I would give them 5 stars but sadly the quality has been inconsistent. I like their Shrimp Mein Fun and their crab puffs and vegetable soup. Their Teriyaki chicken came with no sauce on the chicken. Lo Mein is pretty ok. So is the egg roll. I notice sometimes the food has too much salt. But not all the time. Delivery is usually fast and the delivery person is very nice. Sometimes the brown sauce in the jumbo shrimp and broccoli is really thick. Not in a good way. But when it's well cooked it's delicious! I am hoping they can get more standardized in the kitchen because when they are on point, there is no better Chinese takeout to be had! And the prices are really reasonable."}
{"text":"Was quoted 45 minutes to an hour, but delivery arrived in thirty minutes- nice!  First time ordering anything from China Jade, and I chose delivery, which required a $15 minimum purchase.  Don't know why I assumed delivery would be free- perhaps it's because most places either quote a delivery charge upfront, or offer it free with a minimum purchase.  In any case, delivery was an additional $1.50- whew!  I don't know... something about seeing additional charges when I wasn't expecting any, especially AFTER I've already paid and tipped... Well, it just was a little surprising.  It would be nice to know about these extra charges somewhere on the takeout/delivery menu, yes?   I ordered beef lo mein, BBQ spare ribs, and Hot and crispy beef- all very delicious! http://www.yelp.com/biz_user_photos/sYDc1TENwCKLHvprBa5rLw  The noodles were prepared well, not greasy, and the pieces of beef were lean and not sinewy at all; the ribs had a pleasing chew and were tasty, yet not overly-seasoned, nor sloppy/sticky with sauce; and the hot and crispy beef delivered on the crispy (yes!), without being greasy, had slight salty and sweet flavors to it, and the chili oil indeed added a spicy kick, even though the meat was flavorful without it.  (Enjoyed the steamed, yet crispy broccoli that accompanied this entree!)  Thank goodness the lo mein paired well with all the meats, since I am not able to eat rice without risking allergic reactions.  I have found my go-to Chinese restaurant!  Hope dining in is just as pleasant.  #700"}
{"text":"First, this is a casual, take out place. That's obvious when you walk in. With that in mind: yum! It was a good value and the service was better than you'd expect in that setting. I had the Kung cmPao Chicken dinner special. It had a nice amout of spice, the sauce wasn't too heavy, it had plenty of veggies that weren't overcooked and the chicken was breast meat. They also have  brown rice - I appreciate that. The egg roll wasn't special but it was fine. I'll definitely try them again."}
{"text":"Stay away from this restaurant!.  Their food is loaded with grease, fat and soy sauce.  The most disgusting Chinese food I have ever eaten.  The only thing they do well is tape unwanted flyers/menus on resident's doors, no matter how many times you ask them to stop."}
{"text":"its pretty good food tastes very fresh and fast delivery with easy online ordering its a good price and i have leftovers"}
{"text":"Good chinese food a bit pricey though."}
{"text":"Best wonton soup I've ever had! I love the location of this place right beside my gym and right off of the high way. Anytime I need to go shopping I always have this restaurant close by. The staff is really nice, the store is clean what more can you ask for"}
{"text":"Consistent and friendly! They always know our order. We primarily order the sweet and sour and wor sue chicken, nothing super adventurous. They use quality meat. The sauces, egg rolls, and soups are tasty.  This is the better of the Chinese restaurants in the vicinity."}
{"text":"Food was great, and they took us in as they were locking the door and took our order, which was really nice  thank you!"}
{"text":"We had just moved to town last month and we wanted good chinese. We were so displeased by this place! First of all the portions were ridiculously small for what they charge. Our noodles were greasy and our chicken was cold. Then we all ended up with horrible food poisioning for 3 days straight!!! Stay far away from here!!!! It was the worst experience!!!"}
{"text":"Got my usual today, beef fried rice and chicken wings. Sometimes it's hit or miss but usually a hit. Place is not the cleanest restaurant and I haven't ordered here in awhile but it seems a bit cleaner then before and I have seen worse places. Never ordered deliver, always order and pick food up. Next time you order wings tell them to make them extra crispy. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery here tonight for some vegetable soup and Mongolian beef with rice! The food was excellent, the delivery driver was very nice, and I've had an overall 5/5 experience! Thank you China Jade!!!"}
{"text":"I love China Jade!   I usually order the sweet and sour chicken with lo mein or rice. My husband orders the  chicken fried rice every single time and he loves it.   Today I switched  it up and ordered the rice noodles with chicken, with a side of sweet and sour sauce. Very Tasty!  The delivery is FAST and online ordering is a breeze."}
{"text":"First of all, the egg rolls.   They are amazing!  Big, crispy, and the filling is well-seasoned & meat based. We ate there-- cute spot with a few in-house tables. The sesame chicken was great & the fried rice was very reminiscent of teppanyaki, a little buttery and not too salty. I recommend this place if you want a noticeable step up from Panda Express.   Also-- their portions are pretty big. They gave our food to us in take-out plastic containers, similar to the ones Pei Wei uses. The containers seem small, but my husband was impressed because he actually had to take some home!   The service is super friendly and they seem very family operated. They deliver, which is also fantastic."}
{"text":"China Jade did a lot of things right.  I will order from them again.  I ordered online and it took almost an hour for delivery.  To be clear their restaurant is a very long way from my home,  To start in the middle I ordered sweat and sour soup.  It was cold.  Very thick...very very thick.  If I had been in the restaurant and it have been the nominal too hot to eat temperature, it would have been very good.  The General Tso's Chicken.  It was terrible.  It was the worst General Tso's I've ever had,  I took one bite and then offered it to my two cats.  My cats would have nothing to do with it so then I offered it to my two dogs that will eat anything.  Both of the dogs would have nothing to do with it.  It went down the garbage disposal.  Broccoli Chicken was the third item I ordered.  They nailed it on the broccoli.  Fresh, crisp, and perfectly cooked broccoli.  As bad as they did the General Tso's they absolutely got the broccoli chicken right.  The Broccoli Chicken dish was perfect.  I would recommend the Broccoli Chicken to anyone, and I would advise to avoid the General Tso's Chicken,  Wes Ferguson"}
{"text":"Still waiting after 90 minutes and no delivery. Girl who answers phone has no clue where my food is or what driver has it. All she can say I don't know I am in high school. Worst experience ever. Do not use this place ever."}
{"text":"We decided to pick up Chinese take out for a family visit in Independence and ordered from China Jade. Everyone loved their order and the Wonton and Egg Drop soups were especially tasty!"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery three times in the past few months, and they delivered before the estimated time.  The food was nice and hot.  Since I am from the East coast this is the best Chinese I have found since moving to Scottsdale.  My favorites are the Cheese Wontons, Chicken with Broccoli and Sweet & Sour Chicken.  Their sweet and sour sauce is really good so I always ask for extra."}
{"text":"Sunday night.  Work night.  We made it Chinese food night.  China Jade was good enough to leave a flyer on our doorknob, so we decided to take them up on the opportunity.  Small, not a lot of seating here.  However, there aren't a lot of folks here either and I'm ready for a veggie chow fun plate.  Took a little longer than we expected to get our food, but maybe they had a lot of deliveries that night.  I had a very delicious, BIG plate of chow fun for $8.  My wife ordered the egg foo young dinner special and she enjoyed it too.  Apart from the food and the friendly service, we noticed what a happening place this is.  Not many people were eating at the restaurant itself, but there was a steady stream of folks coming in ordering food to go.  This place is popular and busy-- I'm not surprised.  With tasty food at a nice price, people seem to stop by here often for a meal.  After our experience here, we will too.  Haven't been here yet?  Give them a try."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. 2nd time I ordered delivery and they over looked my order and didn't make my food. They didn't compensate or anything. No manager was on duty and the response was very bad and unprofessional. They have forgotten parts of my order another time. I'm done with this place. Very very poor service."}
{"text":"First Chinese place I've eaten at on this side of town. Their cheese wontons are to die for. I love their hot and sour soup and egg drop soup. Always delicious and they're always friendly."}
{"text":"China Jade is our Go To Chinese restaurant in Tempe.  We tried one other Chinese restaurant when we first moved and were not a fan.  We found China Jade and have not even bothered looking for any back up.  We have tried many of the items on the menu and cannot remember any of them being anything less than good, most of the time They Hit The Spot :)  It is a small hole in the wall, in a strip mall that is blah, but don't be deceived, the food is worth the stop and parking is usually really easy.  Very reasonably priced for good sized portions that usually yield left overs."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food ever, if I could give them no star I will.service is poor , I am not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Don't get the general tso \"chicken\".. It's definitely not chicken. I don't know what it is but it looks to be mostly fried bread and chicken nerves."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese food in Cleveland. I moved to Middleburg hts and am lost without it. Everyone else pales in comparison. Try the general tso's or pork chow mien. And their won ton soup is the best! Always great service too when we sit down to dine in. And enough leftovers to feed a small army. Great establishment whose quality standards have stood the test of time!"}
{"text":"Delicious food at a reasonable price.  You can even order online and have it delivered.  Very quick and friendly desk ladies"}
{"text":"General Tso's chicken was incredible! Not as overly breaded or heavy as many places. The delivery was also much faster than originally estimated! Will order again!   I ordered using Yelps eat24 app and the total price was a few bucks less then other delivery apps, so that was a pleasant surprise. I also liked how eat24 let me customize just how spicy I wanted it!"}
{"text":"This place delivers to my house.  The shop itself doesn't look the cleanest inside.  I usually just call in for delivery.  Food is always pretty decent.  The delivery does not take very long and they usually get the order right every time."}
{"text":"Best chinese food that I have had on the west side of Cleveland. Love knowing i'm served chicken is actually chicken and not some fake out meat.  Egg rolls are delish so are the crab rangoons. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"For the price, it's excellent. Now that Lychee Inn is gone from the area (tears, tears, tears), I'm having a hard time finding Chinese food nearby that's better than this at any price. So far I've had the egg foo young and General Tso's chicken, and both were great.  The fact that they deliver is icing on the cake. The only downside is that they're close enough to my house that I feel stupid lazy if I don't go and pick it up myself."}
{"text":"This the second time my friends and I ordered China Jade. The first time it was amazing. They food was great, the service was great, totally 5-star worthy. The second time does not even deserve 1-star. First, the delivery person was very rude over the phone and telling us to be more specific because he could not find our place. When he got here, he continued to lecture us how we did not give him specific instructions to get to our place even though we gave our address. Since he was so rude to us we did not tip him. He then texted my friend! (the number we gave from the delivery) He got mad because we did not tip him! He went on saying that he does not make money any other way. When I told him he was rude and said no he wasn't. He then continued to text and call my friend! Talk about super creepy and probably illegal! I called the manager to let her know what happened and she was so unapologetic. She just kept saying \"sorry\" in a monotone voice and just gave us 15% off next time. This makes me not want to continue eating here even if they food is good. No establishment should allow this to happen. We were very disappointed and probably will not order from here again."}
{"text":"This was my favorite place to get \"Chinese food\" from when I lived in North Scottsdale.   This is delicious greasy food. If you're looking for something healthy or authentic... try something else. This is divey-take outy-local owned joint."}
{"text":"Ordered through GrubHub.  Painless process!  Super fast delivery. Food was HOT!  Quality was as expected for a traveler's neighborhood restaurant.  Jumbo shrimp with mixed veggies was good, as was the Wonton soup.  Lots of big wontons.  They provided plenty of condiments!  And, they got my order right.  Did I mention the food was hot?!  Forgot the napkins, but not going to nitpick.  I would recommend them for business travelers."}
{"text":"I have tried a lot of Chinese restaurants in the area, and I can say this is the best so far. They have the best beef with broccoli, chicken friend rice, and for some reason, their plain rice is very good.  The serving is very reasonable for the price. Great delivery time and they are very efficient. The orders are always correctly delivered. Drivers are polite. I am a fan!"}
{"text":"At work today we decide we wanted Chinese food so we looked on Yelp for recommendations and China Jade had the highest rating. So we decided to give it a shot. Their web site, made it very easy to place an order for pick up. It was all downhill from there. I walked into the restaurant and walked up to the counter. I received no greeting and was just asked what I wanted. I told the man behind the counter I placed an order online. He turns around looks at a piece of paper on the wall and says to me $36. I gave him my money and wait another 10 minutes for the order to be ready. I did notice 2 other people in the restaurant 2 different tables. It turned out they also worked there. The Asian woman seemed unhappy to be there, another customer came in and the woman got up to help him then went back to her table and sat there looking at her cell phone. I finally get my order and return to work. Unpacking the bags I noticed liquid all over, the bottom soup container was crushed by the other soups they decided to stack on top of it. We ordered 5 different entrees and none were labeled. Made it a little difficult to figure out who got what. So finally sit down to eat my wonton soup, I bit into a wonton, the flavor was good but then I looked at the other piece of wonton and it had  a piece of metal in it. I decided not to eat any more. I ordered the General TSO chicken, presentation looked good at first. But after eating some chicken, I will have to agree with previous reviews it was all breading and actually very little chicken in the middle. It's like they double dip them in breading for some reason. 1 person at work got orange chicken which was also heavily breaded. All the chicken dishes looked the same and they tasted like they just poured different sauces on them before serving. Needless to say I was not impressed and did not finish my General TSO's chicken. I will not return."}
{"text":"I grew up down the street from this restaurant so my family got take out here a lot.  I've only dined in a few times.  The restaurant lacks charm and is very outdated.  The service is ok, not the best.  On my most recent dine-in experience, my brother ordered a Pepsi and the waitress came out with a can.  When we got the bill, we saw that they charged $1.75... for a can of pop! Despite the service and decor, I like this place.  Food is good and cheap.  Meals are under $10. They have the best won ton soup.  Each day there is a daily lunch special."}
{"text":"I paid 16 dollars for 1 large chicken and broccoli and one order of chickens wings. The bag that contained my meal was ridiculously greasy. To top it all off there was no utensils."}
{"text":"Egg rolls are unbelievably awesome! Can't get enough of them. Wow! I can't wait to have them again."}
{"text":"Great food, plenty of food and done when you order it, not pre-made.  In fact I like it better than Pei Wei which is just around the corner. Now if you want fancy plates and silverware and that is your criteria for eating, then the plastic forks and plates will not tickle your fancy. But if you want good, fresh and enjoyable food then this is the place to go. They have become one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery the delivery man tried stepping into my apartment I didn't not feel comfortable. Food was not good. Chicken was all bread no meat. lo mein is big noodles soaked in soy sauce. Cream cheese puffs was Almost liquid. So dissatisfied with this place do not waist your money!"}
{"text":"I'm so bummed after reading such great reviews. Delivery took 40 minutes, but was estimated at 45-60. The food was sub par at best. I had an unidentified meat in my wontons, no breading on my Kung Pao chicken, and a flavorless fried rice, with no eggs! There was so much filler in my chicken too, I definitely won't return. Half my entree was squash! Maybe it's different on the east coast, but I don't recommend the food or delivery since you have a minimum of $15 and a delivery fee!"}
{"text":"Terrible. At least what I had was. Don't get the orange beef it's literally all fat. My boyfriend also said his hot garlic beef and hot and sour soup were awful. Maybe we just need to try something else on the menu but I'm very hesitant to return."}
{"text":"Place only accepts cash for small orders. Food is low quality."}
{"text":"I had order for delivery at noon normally another restaurant get busy and the foods always come late but here foods come really fast like 30 mins only."}
{"text":"Good food (when its right) for a great price!!! BUT (huge but) horrible service! All of the food i got was wrong. Called to try to get it fix and could not get the owner or an manager on the phone.An irritated employee told me that the owner did not want to talk to me about the order being messed up and he hung up on me, not before saying \"I'm tired of this place\" SMH I guess i cant order from this place when ordering for the Exce's anymore!"}
{"text":"Food has been incredible every time. Empress chicken and the egg rolls are my favorite."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years . And I never have had a problem until recently. The chicken is like rubber you can't even cut it, I took it back the following day and all I wanted was a new dinner . And the lady FREAKED OUT ME . \"Why you bring back\" because you chicken tasted like crap and was rubber . And then they gave me a shrimp egg roll when I asked for vegetable egg roll . And me having a raw fish allergy . That was fun to eat and a nice trip to the hospital."}
{"text":"Review number 777. The divine number. This review will be cryptic in nature with numerological undertones.   China Jade is another restaurant that colleagues have brought me to. If not for them, I probably would have never seen this place or tried it. I am glad I did. The service is terrific. The guys I work with have been coming here for years and they are remembered by the staff. I actually really like the vibe of the place. The front entrance is pretty cool because once you set foot inside that threshold, you have no idea what to expect. It reminds me of Funkadelic \"Standing on the Verge of Getting it On\". Now I will quote Good Thoughts, Bad Thoughts because these lyrics have been heavy on my mind and in my heart:  Travel like a king Listen to the inner voice A higher wisdom is at work for you Conqering the stumbling blocks come easier When the conqueror is in tune with the infinite Every ending is a new beginning Life is an endless unfoldment Change your mind, and you change your relation to time  You can find the answer The solution lies within the problem The answer is in every question Dig it? An attitude is all you need to rise and walk away Inspire yourself Your life is yours It fits you like your skin  The oak sleeps in the acorn The giant sequoia tree sleeps in its tiny seed The bird waits in the egg God waits for his unfoldment in man Fly on, children Play on  You gravitate to that which you secretly love most You meet in life the exact reproduction of your own thoughts There is no chance, coincidence or accident In a world ruled by law and divine order You rise as high as your dominant aspiration You descend to the level of your lowest concept of your self Free your mind and your ass will follow  The infinite intelligence within you knows the answers Its nature is to respond to your thoughts Be careful of the thought-seeds you plant in the garden of your mind For seeds grow after their kind  Play on, children  Every thought felt as true Or allowed to be accepted as true by your conscious mind Take roots in your subconscious Blossoms sooner or later into an act And bears its own fruit Good thoughts bring forth good fruit Bullshit thoughts rot your meat Think right, and you can fly The kingdom of heaven is within Free your mind, and your ass will follow  Play on, children Sing on, lady.   China Jade is not a bad place to go to lunch with co-workers. If I had a family, I would probably take them there."}
{"text":"I placed a delivery order at 8pm- they advised it would be delivered within 30-40 minutes as I was only a couple of miles away. At 8.50pm I called to follow up and they must have shut because no one was answering the phone. Food never came. Hungry!!!! Will never attempt To go back or order again. Their loss!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now and really enjoyed it. The Mongolian beef and wonton soup seem to be my favorite. The food is made with fresh ingredients, in the poultry and beef always taste really good. I"}
{"text":"The young boy  made mistake giving me change back when i told the mother she got mad  at me for telling on her son not giving me the right change back  while playing on his phone not paying attentions , and then she told me ok sir  i don't want to  see u  here again after she gave me the proper change .. don't let her son ring you up cause he's busy playing with game he shouldn't even be at register under age.  i will not ever buy from them again good is sucks end it up throwing it in trash where it belongs"}
{"text":"Great food after a long day! Everything we ordered was excellent. Fried wontons were excellent. Delivery was prompt."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Love this place it's become the only Chinease I order since morning to the area . Giving it 4 stars because they don't deliver. Pick up orders are ready within 15 min.there always friendly and nice . They make a house duck sauce that is also really good."}
{"text":"Ordered the wonton soup..was nasty..the wontons were very starchy and filled with what looked like poop also had some old celery in it..fried rice was ok but felt gross after trying the soup.. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed take out and eating in at this restaurant. The food always has a fresh taste to it. Big fresh veggies. They're friendly. It's clean inside."}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall inconspicuous Chinese restaurant. But it's a place you must try. I had the Egg Foo Young, Pork Chow Mein, Fried Rice combo... 7 bucks. Should have taken a photo. It was outstanding and the portion enormous. Don't think anyone could eat this entire meal unless you're [The Man vs Food guy] in one sitting. The wait staff is very friendly and they serve shrimp chips with the meal which I am addicted to. The hot tea was also very good. My only minor complaint is they charge extra for wonton soup which most Chinese restaurants include in their combo price."}
{"text":"I ordered for pickup and arrived at 9:20 pm all the employees were at the door ready to close with lights off  even though it said they close at 9:30 pm.  Food is mediocre barley any meat in my orders and sauce spilled everywhere thanks to their choice of containers   . Wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Asian resturants and Arizona but they are over rated. Coming from DC, we enjoy out flavor.   I got the orange flavored bean curd and the tofu was soft and soggy. The flavor was lacking and bland.   Service was mediocre, was not given napkins or utensils for my to go order. Had to go back in for them.   They also had their young daughter running through the back of the store when she should have been properly taken care of at home."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and was pretty disappointed after reading such great reviews. The egg drop soup was so thick I couldn't eat it. Very gelatin looking. I had the orange chicken as directed by reviews and it was OK. Not wonderful but not bad. Left much of my Chinese craving unsatisfied."}
{"text":"I love China Jade. I order take out and have dined in. The waitresses are so friendly. The food has a fresh taste and isn't overflowing with salt. Definitely recommend China Jade if you're looking for Chinese in the Old Brooklyn area."}
{"text":"The prices are a little higher than most other local Chinese take out places, but the food is higher quality- especially the meat products. The wonton soup is amazing- haven't found any like it anywhere, and I will make the drive from Columbus when a craving strikes. I've been going there more than ten years and I'm not about to stop."}
{"text":"They deliver all over Tempe awesome Chinese!  Had General Tso's, pork fried rice, lo mein, and a big order of BBQ ribs! Tasty and plentiful. Far, far better than Hunan."}
{"text":"Ordered at 200p - at 330p they called said my credit card was wrong gave them the same card magically it worked - I was told that it would be another 45 minutes because they were busy - um you couldn't say that before you charged my card??? Food arrived and I ordered 1 with a brown sauce one with a cream sauce - I got 1 box of rice not 2 and 2 containers of the same thing. NEVER AGAIn"}
{"text":"Always order from here thru grub hub. Always great food and delivers on time everytime. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty good food at amazingly affordable prices and they deliver to my work.  I have ordered a few times and have been pleased with the Mongolian Beef, the Sweet and Sour Chicken, and the Kung Pao Chicken.  My only complaint was the Crab Puffs/Wontons which were a bit too chewy but they made up for it with excellent egg rolls!  Generous portions and lots of natural flavoring from the veggies.  Definitely not the best food I have ever had but it's very good and for the money, they cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"I got orange chicken and vegetables- delivered! Quick. Friendly was even willing to bring me back a menu. I declined as I used yelp to order. But the fact driver was willing to go back and bring a menu. Add fifth star.  Orange chicken. Presentation great and it was atleast 2-3 meals for me. Taste. AMAZING breading was light still crisp and sauce. Perfect not too thin/thick Veggies. Very good perfectly cooked  Egg rolls fresh. Delish  Steamed rice. Good hard to ruin that  Here for six weeks definitely a reorder in my future"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week for lunch takeout. The food is always ready in under 15 min for pick-up. For under $7 with tax, you get a delicious and filling lunch entree.  My personal favorites are the Mongolian beef and beef lo mien. The lunch also comes with an egg drop soup!"}
{"text":"I order from them maybe 3x per wk or less. I had only one complaint they blamed it on me but the many other times I order I give a 5 star for the food is yummy and hot . Just one time out of many they where over an hr late besides that they are fast."}
