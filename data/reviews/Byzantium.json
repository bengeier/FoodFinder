{"text":"Been here only once and tried kangaroo for the first time.  Not impressed by it but I think that's just the characteristics of a kangaroo steak.  The best way to describe it is probably a cheap lean steak.

The carpaccio was delicious."}
{"text":"I tried the Kangaroo medallions and they tasted like filet mignon pieces. Usually, when I'm willing to drop $30 on a main course, I expect a 5 star meal and this just didn't cut it. My friend got the lamb and it was pretty good but again, I've had better lamb for the same price.The martini drink choices are fabulous! I'd come here for the martinis if you're willing to spend $7-$11 for each drink. It was a fun, gay friendly restaurant but I wouldn't come back here again to eat the food since it's a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"I would definitely come back to this restaurant next time I am in town. I'm here for a business trip and wanted to check out the gayborhood. So I decided to pick a nice restaurant int the area. I went here for the first time this past Friday night. I didn't make any reservation at all. I showed up around 8am, it was snowing and cold. When I got in, the hostess seated the 3 girls ahead of me. Then the polite man who turned out to be my server asked me for how many guests. I said only me and he looked at the seating chart for a few seconds. Then marked a spot on the chart and seated me by the window. I was happy that he seated me in a prime location of the restaurant. The place was packed. I was expecting something in the back corner or a 30 min wait. I sat down and he handed me the wine list, dinner menu, and some winter promotion menu that wasn't effective until the next day. He came back a few minutes later and asked if I wanted to order a drink. I said I haven't made up my mind yet and so he politely said to take my time. Shorlty, he came back to check with me. I ordered a half bottle of the '09 Kenwood cab but I'm not ready to order for dinner yet. But as a starter, I ordered the carpaccio. Minutes later, he came back with the wine. Poured a sample and it tasted sufficient for my palate. He filled my glass and politely asked if there is anything else I need. I said, well yes, I'm ready to order the main course. And I ordered the lamb shank. He walked away and I opened a business magazine to read. Less than 10mins later, the food runner came with the carpaccio. It was well presented. It was thinly sliced and very red but not bloody. It looked like a blue fin tuna sashimi with thinly sliced parm, grape tomatoes, and some sort of greens. And it tasted like what carpaccio is supposed to taste like. Once I was done with it, the waiter was very attentive. He arrived a minute later and asked me if he may clear the plate. I said yes and he noticed that my wine glass was nearing empty so he filled it up for me. He continued this the entire night. He was very attentive of where I was on my glass of wine and never had it to empty for me. I continued with my book and about 15mins later the food runner brought my lamb shank. He asked if there is anything else such as pepper and I said \"no, I am okay.\" But when I was about to slice off a piece from the lamb shank, I realized I needed a knife. All I have in front of me was a fork and a butter knife I used for the bread and hummus they brought when I sat down. I tried to get my waiter's attention but he was busy with the rest of the diners. So I continued by just using the butter knife for the time being until I get his attention. I had to wipe off the hummus with the bread so that I can use the butter knife. Finally I was able to get the waiter's attention and he politely obliged to get me a steak knife. He came within seconds and refilled my wine at the same time. I slowly ate the lamb while enjoying my book and wine. The lamb was a bit in the gamey side. I wish they had not over-cooked it. If not, it should have been braised where it would just crumble in your mouth. The lamb was chewy and that's probably the reason I am giving this restaurant a 4. But the whole dining experience was wonderful. The service was excellent. The ambience was vibrant and yet classy...not too loud. See you guys next time I am back in Toronto."}
{"text":"Do you like martini's? Me too.

Byzantium is a Church St. staple. Its impossibly thin and long. One half is a dining room for dinner only (I think), the other is just one super long bar with seats and a whole bunch of hot, traditional bartenders. It's like Cocktail on steroids here.

It gets pretty packed at night, and leans more to the boy crowd. 25 and up but there's the odd younger bean in the bunch. They have local DJs like Dekoze spin and the bartenders can literally make anything.

On the weekends, it's the perfect place to meet up with friends for a few 'tini's before heading out dancing."}
{"text":"Excellent food, with a good selection of exotic meats (ostrich, kangaroo).  I'd never paid much attention to the dinner menu--I've usually visited Byzantium for pre-club drinking, thanks to the extensive martini menu--but the food is sophisticated and well presented.  Get there early, though--after about 11, they clear the tables in the front room to make a dance floor."}
{"text":"I'm really glad Byzantium exists, because...

...all of the other \"good\" places in the Village have closed (I'm thinking of Spiral, Inspire, Fuzion, Kaiseki, even miss the old Al Forno, Gatsbys, etc.) only to be replaced by trashy, low end joints or yet another faux Victorian pub. What the hell is going on in the Village? It's not good, whatever it is.

Anyway. Yes, Byzantium still does a nice quality dinner, good drinks and wine. I like it that when they reserve a table, they actually reserve it (I prefer a window table) with a table card. The wine is kept in a proper bucket, and the service is perfect. We had the very affordable Summerlicious special and all three courses were perfect, even the key lime pie (just the right size also)."}
{"text":"I have been to Byzantium many times, both for dinner and just for drinks, and by that I mean martinis! (of which I believe they have a martini list 4 pages or so long, so you'll definitely find something you like or would like to try!!)

Everytime I've eaten here I've been pleased! I usually order the Caprese salad which is always delicious, but also have the luck of trying my guest's salad or soup. One time it was my mom's butternut squash soup with a hint of cinnamon, and I loved it so much, I almost ordered a second appetizer! Another time it was a goat cheese salad with a sesame vinaigrette dressing, yummy too!

The entrées are challenging for me cuz I don't eat red meat or wild game or fuzzy creatures...I'm a chicken or fish kinda girl. Problem with Byzantium for me is the creativity of their entrée section, you'll often see things like quail, and ostrich (a customer favorite), rabbit, and I remember boar being on there once, don't know if it was wild or not? Good thing is they'll always have one fish special and a pasta special, and they have one chicken dish on the menu. So I usually go for the fish. One time it was tilapia, but the time I died was the halibut, pan-seared to perfection and asparagus on the side. Each flaky flavorful bite was heaven. I remember my girlfriend having beef medallions, so I didn't share, but she thought they were divine!!

Not to be undersold by dessert!!! My absolute favorite: crème brûlée! And not just one but a trio of them, yum-o! A traditional, a banana flavored, and a hazelnut flavored!! I say again, YUM-O!!!

In my opinion, you get what you pay for, Byzantium is expensive, but the food quality is awesome! Martinis are yummy! Service is polite and courteous. This IS my favorite place to dine!!"}
{"text":"My visits here are mainly to dine, as I have found the long bar clients quite unfriendly and the bar-tenders even more so. Not a place to meet or even talk to anybody.
Food however is quite different. Adequate menu with some interesting twists i.e. bison. Sit close to street windows, which open in summer, to people watch. Service is professional."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight.  Do I ever eat at home?  Byz was fine -  great street atmosphere with the front window open.  Prime rib was okay and sides were good  service was excellent as always."}
{"text":"Great place to be seen, a Church St establishment. Drinks are rather pricey but live DJ spinning some great tracks helps add to environment. Generally prettier people get served much faster. Only complaint , being there for dinner and drinks is that music is EXCEPTIONALLY loud for such a small space, making conversation very challenging at times. (hint please to owners). Excellent design and layout, big recommendation."}
{"text":"After a lot of debate on which restaurant to try for summerlicious, we finally narrowed our option down to Byzantium. Especially cos they were atleast a little favourable to vegetarians. 

For starters, we ordered the zucchini fritters, grilled vegetable stack and the calamari. The fritters were the indisputable winner in a very close match. The stack was actually grilled and not charcoaled and the Sauce helped escalate the flavour. The calamari was great too. 

For the main course, i had the tikka salmon fillet, cooked medium well. The salmon could have used some more seasoning for me, but the crispy onions and sauce brought it together. My friends ordered the stuffed peppers and the Panko chicken schnitzel, both of which were delicious. The salmon was probably the best. 

For dessert, only 3 words - KEY LIME PIE. 

All in all, a great summerlicious and dining experience. No complaints at all. You will not be disappointed. 

Shout out to our wonderful server, Kyle."}
{"text":"Decided to come here just to check out what all the commotion was about.  Loved it.  The reason why I gave it 3 stars though is because of the loud music and how it was so crowded."}
{"text":"The chicken Cesar are to die for and the lychee martinis as well. I went to this restaurant lots of times and every time I had a very good time. I went for my birthday - where I also got a tiara, and for casual dining with friends.
The space is decorated very well and the staff is friendly, the atmosphere is energetic and fun but also relaxing of you just want to have a bite with your partner. The cool thing about this restaurant is that it turns into a club after 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays, with deejay and cool house music and it gets always packed - sometimes there is a line -.
It also nice that the front of the place as a huge glass wall so you can seat and just watch people walking by on church street on the weekend can be very entertaining.
I do recommend this place, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious and found the food to be ok. Nothing special. The service was fast and we were able to pack our dessert to make it to the raptors game. The poutine and fish was nothing special. I do agree the drinks can be amazing. I asked the server to bring out two martinis that are more on the tart side. The watermelon flavoured martini was good, but too sweet for my taste and hardly tart. I really enjoyed how the martini looked with the different layers.
 The other martini had a great balance of tart to sweetness."}
{"text":"Byzantium has been one of my favourite spots for years now, mostly because of their awesome staff, great cocktails and extensive beer menu. I also love how it's a restaurant/bar by day, and night club by night with live music and a DJ.

The cocktails and martinis here are absolutely amazing (although you definitely pay for it) and the beers are always great too. The few times I have eaten here, I have thoroughly enjoyed the food. The steak frites and chicken caesar salad are particularly tasty.

Be sure to ask for Kent at the bar, he makes an excellent mojito and is super friendly and thoroughly professional. There is a small back patio out the back, but to be honest I have never been out there so can't pass judgement on it.

If you are in the area and want a great cocktail, martini or a cold beer, Byzantium is THE place to be. The only drawback during the summer months is the lack of a patio, but the front of the restaurant does open to give you the \"open air\" feeling."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for drinks -- I don't know who the bartender is, but he/she is pretty damn good at what he/she does. There's a huge selection of martinis, both classic and original creations. You also can't go wrong with the original mixed drinks either.

Oh, did I mention the servers are all very studly?"}
{"text":"Food was very good and very fast to the table. I had a complaint with their sea bass in the puff pastry. I couldn't cut, never mind chew the crust. But the rest was very flavourful. The turkey burger, Beet salad, pizza  and other plain beef burger was very good. I sampled a little of each. And those  who ordered it were pleased as well. Service was friendly but a little slow in asking for our orders. But once they were placed the good came quite quickly and well presented. Ambiance was dark and not to be confused with any prejudice or bias. but this est. is located in the heart of Wellesley and Church. So it could get a little loud close to the bar. For the most part we were pleased with the service and hospitality."}
{"text":"We've been doing the range of Summerlicious meals for years, but Byzantium hits one of our top 5 for sure. Those tofu fritters --those salads --those fish tacos --that turkey burger! All of it was incredible, outstanding, memorable. Our only regret is that we didn't come here sooner."}
{"text":"A popular restaurant with some nice dishes, but they fall flat when getting too adventurous.  Delicious roast chicken as a main course (it seems that everyone nowadays just eats a lot of chicken).  And the chicken dumplings are a fun appetizer, albeit a bit sweet and gummy.  The service is often professional and friendly enough but sometimes falls a bit short (for instance, a request to put a candle in my partner's dessert to celebrate his birthday went unheeded).  Again, it's a good place in the neighbourhood, and very fun..  But I'm not sure how many people dining here are truly serious eaters."}
{"text":"Since we were close by and the hotel staff suggested a visit with high praise, we decided to grab dinner here on our last night (Sunday).   1/3 of the table full but we were prompted with \"Do you have reservations?\" questions and frowns.   Told only the front section would be our choice, which was fine as tourists in today, it's a people watching view of those on Church St.

First - the good.   Decent food, nicely portioned.   Not OMG food, not great food - just OK/decent, average food - we've had worse, but we expected better.

But the service did us in.   Our waiter was entertaining specific tables, and judging by the talk, they were his friends.   We were seated, and after a longer then reasonable time took a drink order.   Once again, a longer period of time before drinks arrived - we had to wait for the show at the table beside us between him and that table of close guests.   As the drinks arrived, we asked to order - which appeared to shock him, as he replied \"Are you BOTH ready to order?  Do you each KNOW what you want?  Server came with food, but we never saw the waiter at our table again until we had to wave him down for the check."}
{"text":"Became a bit of a regular for the Sunday prime rib. Not the best in the city but acceptable for $17.95. Service sucks, only one waiter really seems to know his position well.  If you must go here, look for the ginger, he is amazing, the rest will rush you out even though the place is always empty. In what seems to be an effort to reinvent themselves they now have a noisy 3 piece band on Sundays.  Totally not suited to the place, the acoustics suck making the music sound more like noise. As a result we have decided to try to find new Prime Rib spot. If you know any, let us know! 

If Byzantium would like to increase business they should start with improving service and quality... and get rid of the amateur bands. This place is not suitable for live music."}
{"text":"When Il Fornello closed down the only equivalent on the street in regards to food, service and atmosphere was Byzantium. I gave it a three star review because I thought it fell short when I compared the two. I've been frequenting this restaurant lately and I have to give this place an updated review; it's really become a great restaurant on Church St. 

My stance on the menu still stands, it's a tad adventurous with the random meat selections (sorry, Ostrich just isn't an animal I'd like to eat) but they've updated it to appeal to those less adventurous, including new dishes like the curry chicken pasta and the beef tenderloin."}
{"text":"Byzantium served great fish - the ingredients were very fresh.  The ribs are definitely home-made, but could be crispier. Calamari was quite good, along with the yam chips. Mussels could have had more taste.

Great winelist. Didn't try the martinis.

Service was average. All-in-all, the restaurant was pretty good. Didn't try the patio in the back, but it looked cozy. 

Would go back to try other items."}
{"text":"I used to live in the neighbourhood and never ate here ! So I finally stopped in for Winterlicious part 2 to caught up with some girlfriends on friday nite . I will definitely be back , great service, ambience. The mango mojito was the perfect combition of sweet and strong."}
{"text":"For Pride 2013 weekend, it was my first time attending this event and it was my first time on Church street. My friend and I walked around and enjoyed the wild entertainment and soon after got hungry. We saw Byzantium and it looked pretty cool so we went inside. There was no greeter but we caught a servers eye and she said we could sit wherever we liked. We sat near the front so we would feel the small breeze coming in since it was a little humid inside. I went to use the washrooms which were located all the way back of the restaurant and when I started to walk down the stairs, all this weird stuff was happening, mind you.. I was still not aware that this was a gay bar. I was witnessing some crazy drunkery outside the washroom and couldn't tell if there was a guy or a girl in the womens/mens washroom. The washrooms were dirty and I wasn't too happy using them. I came back to my table and the menus were out, I ordered myself a Long Island and my friend ordered a glass of red wine. Throughout the evening the server was fast, patient, and a charming fella. As soon as we got our drinks, we decided to order and share the Four seasons pizza and Byzantium Mediterranean dip platter. Within a couple of minutes we were given complimentary cinnamon raisin bread and pepper crackers with hummus, it was really good. While we waited for our food, the DJ started to set up and removed some tables at the front to change it over to lounge/club. When the DJ started to rip it, slowly people started to go onto the dance floor and the food happened to arrive around the same time. When we tried the pizza, it looked and tasted great, each quarter of the pizza had different toppings so we got to try four different pizzas in one! The platter was healthy and delicious, with beets, hummus, tzatiki, olives, celery, carrots with pita, it was a great size and filling. While I was enjoying my food, I looked over and saw a lot of same sex couples on the dance floor and say after my third celery stick in, there was more action happening on the dance floor than on my mediterranean platter. All I remember is trying to focus on my food, which was hard to do because my peripheral vision was catching some X rated madness. Everytime I took a bite, I heard moaning... it was epic. After we got our bill, we thought, why not join in and dance a bit. I thought we were less likely to get hit on because people would assume my friend and I would be gay, so I started to tear it up like Vanilla ice. I thought terribly wrong... to my surprise I was sandwhiched by a girl and a guy and all this explicitness went down! It was so funny and awkward at the same time but I was out of this place quick times. I survived serious things.. Overall unique and crazy experience and the food was great ;)"}
{"text":"I first ate there 15 years ago and it's the same owners and same fabulous food. Relatively speaking the prices have not gone up that much. I have eaten here over the years and the food is done to perfection and delicious. The servers are lovely. The martinis are to die for! This is the place that got me hooked on roasted garlic mashed potatoes!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place! My table of 4 was seated at their patio located at the back of the restaurant. It was extremely cozy, with pillows on the seats and surrounded by Christmas lights hanging along the trees. The patio is quite small, around 5 tables if I remember correctly. 

I had their Caesar salad and fish tacos. The Caesar salad caught me by surprise initially. I've never seen it plated as such! It looked like a sculpture. A little hard to eat initially, but tasted amazing. The fish tacos came with 2 pieces. The Caesar salad had filled me already so I saved to second taco for takeout. Their food was amazing. 

Our server also gave our table a free martini. Shoutout to him - this dining experience couldn't have been better."}
{"text":"2.5-3 stars.

My friends and I came here yesterday for summerlicious. With their summerlicious at $38, there were a lot of options for apps and mains so we were pretty excited. We ordered our drinks first, and then our apps - we all shared the mussels and the seafood trio which I loved. Apps came within 30 mins I would say, and we were so hungry so we all devoured that. Next, however was the waiting game. I think we waited close to an hour for our mains.  We were probably forgotten. So that's why I'm giving it a low rating because service was slow as heck. Or maybe because the kitchen was short staffed that night but everyone was starving! 

Finally, our food was served. I got the baby back ribs and they're not like fall off the bone kind but it's still really good. The portion is really big so it's good value! For dessert, all of us got the key lime pie and our other friend got the chocolate cake. I really enjoyed the key lime, but one of my friend Lana. D on yelp found a bug on her key lime pie. Gross! So the server took it away, and maybe 15 minutes later they gave her a new piece. I wonder how long they take to cut pie...

Anyways overall, the meal was great and they removed two drinks off our bill. but everything just took a long time. We heard Byzantium is closing down soon because a lgbt bookstore will be taking over the space. So if you enjoy this restaurant than maybe you should drop by one last time..as for me, I don't think I would."}
{"text":"According to people in the know, Byzantium is a Church Street staple and where all the cool kids congregate. At night, the storefront is barely recognizable and darkness cloaks the grime. Lights shine brightly, luring potential customers and long-standing patrons alike.

Byzantium is separated into two parts: lounge and restaurant. Delicious martinis keep the lounge full. The restaurant, with its tempting and extensive menu, keeps the would-be hungry sated. 

Word to the wise, towards the end of the night, it becomes harder and harder to flad down the staff."}
{"text":"It was a really nice venue, but I wasn't a huge fan of the music this saturday.  It was also quite crowed.  A small dance floor, but plenty of space in the narrow bar are to mingle and meet people.

You can eat here too! However it was quite expensive ($15 for a pizza, or for a dip platter) The only thing that was afforadable was the fries (of different flavours and sweet potato with ailoi for $5.

What i did like was he variety and extnsive martini and cocktail menu. There are no prices, $9 - 11 . 
The service was also quite good. Very prompt, and plates and glasses taken away in a timely manner. I didn't like that with our ten people group that immediate 17% (!!!) tip was automatically added onto our bill (ONTOP of the TAX) that was about $40 extra. Wow. 

I'd come again for the drinks, but for the dancing, I'd take it to Crew/Tango."}
{"text":"One minute you're eating at a restaurant, the next you're gyrating in a club spinning hits from the 90's & 2000's. Byzantium is just that type of place. 

Service was both the high point & the low point. The manager (owner?) could not have been any nicer, seating us up front mere inches from the bustling sidewalk. However, placing orders & getting food out to us was slow-moving to the extreme. 

Foods:
- the vegetarian dish ($24) was a mish-mash of randomness: rice & bean croquette, a tower of roasted veg with pesto, & fried cauliflower. It seemed to me that all the veggies that needed using up were thrown together willy-nilly & called an entree. 
- trio of creme brulee: not a fan of green tea so didn't try that flavor. Cinnamon sugar & salted caramel were heavenly spoonfuls flavored true to their names. Texture was more runny than firm, but flavor made up for that snafu."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here. I followed another Yelper's recommendation and had the steak frites with hollandaise sauce and loved it! Will definitely go back. So many martini choices on the menu that it's hard to know what to have."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of my girlfriends for Summerlicious. Wow, what an experience. Their menu was excellent and had a lot of different options. That was the reason we chose this place to begin with; $25 and you get to choose from 5-6 items for appetizer and entree. 

I personally had the quinoa salad and fish tacos. That salad was delicious but I kind of wanted to try the Salad of Legends which my friend ordered. It looked like a miniature tower of lettuce wrapped in some sort of biscuit like material. Fascinating. There were also items like mussels and poutine which I have no doubt would also be excellent. The fish tacos were really big and quite good. Most of my friends ordered the famous lamb burger. If you are looking to stuff yourself, that is the dish to get. They do NOT back away from large portions and you will leave feeling that you definitely ate your money's worth. My friends weren't even able to finish theirs. 

Dessert was one of my absolute favourite things. I got the strawberry mousse and it was so light and airy. Perfect way to finish off a meal where I was already so full from everything else. My friends had the chocolate cake. While delicious and rich, it was a little too heavy and too much after such a filling entree. 

Of course, who can leave Byzantium without trying one of their famous martinis. They have one of the most elaborate alcohol menus I've ever seen. I ordered the \"One Night Stand\", a mixture of raspberry vodka and creme de cacao. It really did smell like raspberries and chocolate but it was strong enough to give you a real kick. My friend ordered something a bit smoother, the \"Black Orchid\". It had lemon juice or something in it and was very delicious. 

Final words: this is really a great place to go. The food is absolutely amazing. Decor was very modern and romantic. It was a real treat for both the palate and the eyes (the waiters are quite dashing and so helpful). I will definitely want to come back."}
{"text":"Our experience was OK tonight.  We were going to eat here last night, but there was a large partying the back that prevented them from seating walk in guests.  We noticed the prix fix menu for tonight, so we made reservations in the window table.

We each had a martini and I especially enjoyed the James Dean.  Love the zest, ginger, green tea combo.  We asked our server for suggestions on the menu, and he called us out for asking too many questions.  I'm sorry, but that's your job.  Especially when we are paying for what I consider fine dining.  This did not impress me.  He did end up helping us, but him comments could have been left out.

We shared the beef carpaccio and small Caesar to begin.  The bread and hummus they brought out was super as well. I liked the presentation of the salad.  David wanted to try the kangaroo (after I told him I was skyjack with yelp reviews) and we agreed on the salmon.  We both enjoyed the salmon.  Kangaroo, not so much.  

To get the prix fix price, we ordered the brûlée trio.  It was good, but we enjoyed the chocolate and pb more together than separate.  

Our waiter failed to give us the prix fix price, but returned after five minutes and seeing no CC he remembered.

Ok enough pessimistic points, we've done enough on Church Street, we are ready to move onto some other good restaurants.  Wish Byzantium had been better"}
{"text":"Byzantium is by far the leader in the village for fine dining and martini's. You can't ever go wrong with this place. On Friday/Saturday nights it does turn into a club type scene at 11pm, so dine early! They also are very skilled at handling groups from 8-12 people, my best friend and I each hold our birthday parties here each year and haven't ever been disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere the live jazz is great .Good food nice staff always there to serve you. Great for any nice evening."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious and it was soo good!

I had poutine, lamb burger and key lime pie and it was delicious. The poutine had the best cheese curds and the fries were made with some oil that made it really crispy and flavourful. The lamb burger was pretty unique and it came dressed with goat cheese and onion rings. It was amazing; beats any burger at the Works.  I was so full by dessert and the key lime pie was pretty good too. But the highlight was definitely the poutine and lamb burger.

The service was really good, and the servers always smiled and were pretty attentive even with how busy it was.

Great place to go for summerlicious!"}
{"text":"There's a certain stigma about restaurants in the village, but Byzantium broke that for me. The steak frites was perfectly cooked (if not a big grizzly) but it worked with the cut of meat. The flavor, texture, temperature and plating was all perfect. Of course the service was friendly, witty and professional and the price wasn't terrible. $26 for a good cut of steak isn't as bad as many restaurants in Toronto. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Yet another great $25 Summerlicious deals. I'm finding some of the $25 'licious venues beat the pants off the $45 high end white linen joints everyone bum rushes. 

I went with the super lovely Tara G, per her suggestion. Yelp lists it as a gay bar but it's more of a martini bar in the gay district. I was dressed to impressed Miss Tara but kind of appreciated the gay maitre d' complimenting me on my outfit . I'll take it where I can get it.

Hit of the night, after the martinis, was the lamb burger. It was amazingly juicy. For $25 it came with onion rings, fries, and some salad. It was a full meal in itself. I also had the shrimp cocktail to start and the keylime pie to close. Both okay but I would be back for the lamb burger here at any price.

Service was initially a bit slow. Took a while after being seated for our waiter to take our orders but once over that hump, it was a smooth evening.

The front of the house makes the restaurant look deceptively small. The back portion  goes on, Tardis fashion, for quite some time."}
{"text":"I have been here dancing before (always a fantastic time!), but came here for the first time to eat a couple of weeks ago with a large group.

I started with the Caesar salad.  The presentation was unique.  The salad was tasty with the roasted garlic, but I have had better Caesar's before.  For dinner I had the lamb burger.  It was pretty delicious.  The fries were great too (though I would have liked to have had the option to have the garlic or dill fries - the burger only comes with regular fries).

I was impressed with the menu choices ranging from lamb burgers, to kangaroo to pizza.  The pizza looked a bit small for the price, however.

The service was great.  Our server was attentive and friendly.  

Side note:  9pm on a Friday night is perfect for a big group dinner if you want it to bleed into the dance portion of the night!"}
{"text":"Odd menu choices: kangaroo (how fresh can that be in Southern Ontario), water buffalo (WTF!?!). The tandoori salmon was pretty good, though, and the portions were appropriate ... not too huge, not too small. Loved my BIG martini. Sitting by the window, it was fun to watch the parade of people going by on Church St."}
{"text":"Friday night dinner offered nice view of Church Street.  In from Philly with local friend suggesting here.
We had mixed appetizers, seafood dumpling, Caesar salad and drinks. The food is presented stylistically.  However it is meekly seasoned.  I'd like to see side spicy sauces.  
The prices seemed okay, waiters friendly but not especially menu knowledgeable.  He did make a good wine suggestion.
Fun for a night, not sure I'd make a special trip here."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this restaurant as our option of choice was stopped closing.

So not sure how to describe. The waiter seemed disinterested in answering questions and all the food was wonderful  (making it difficult to make decisions).

I settled on the Cornish hen.  Not the best but substituted it with potato au gratin, which was wondeful. People enjoyed the lamb shanks and the Kangaroo. The mussels were horrible, stay away.

The martinis are chilled and taste good...which it had  more liquor  (odd law). But the Lychee one was better

I think they prefer club nights versus serving dinner."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for Winterlicious on a Tuesday evening. We made a reservation and good thing we did as at 6pm all the tables were occupied. 

The menu had quite a few options which is great as winterlicious menus are sometimes very blah. For starters we had the poutine which was excellent. Nice chunks of cheese, just enough gravy that your fries are not soggy. Yummy yum. 

I got the lamb burger and my friend had the butter chicken. I tasted the butter chicken and while lighter than usual versions (a plus) it was heavily spiced with cardamon or something that was overwhelming. The lamb burger was soft but could have been spiced more as the lamb taste was quite strong. It was ok but not the best. 

Desert was the key lime pie and that tasted really great.  It was a nice way to finish off the meal. They have an extensive martini menu it's hard to pick so we just had the wine shown on the winterlicious menu. I would do my research to come back again for Martinis :)

One more thing the service was really really great. I'm always cautious about going for winterlicious coz some places treat you like a cheap person who doesn't deserve good service. Our waiter was attentive, friendly and always around if we needed anything. Great service. I also liked the ambience of the restaurant. All in all a great winterlicious experience."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, it's pretty easy and common for restaurants to f*ck up Winterlicious, but Byzantium nailed it for me. For a $25 dinner, we had lots of choices for each of the three courses.

I had the creamy mussels, supreme of capon (aka chicken) with apple bread stuffing, and chocolate cake. All DELICIOUS. This was my first time trying mussels after like a 10-year hiatus, and they were SO GOOD... The soupy marinade they came with was exquisite. The chicken was flavourful and moist, as was the chocolate cake.

My friend who is deathly allergic to nuts was also able to join us for dessert, which is rare... She was stoked. Service was lovely and attentive. The bartenders were friendly and hot (although, judging by the neighbourhood, they probably didn't even glance my way). The martinis were exciting.

Great experience... Thanks Byzantium :)"}
{"text":"Byzantium is a trendy place to dine in the gay village.  They have a HUGE martini menu (so many that it is divided into sections such as \"sweet\" and \"tart\"), which is highly appropriate given this area's appetite for cocktails.

The menu is very meat-based, and even features rarities such as ostrich and kangaroo.  Being in a not-too-adventurous mood last night, I stuck with the baby back ribs, served with sweet potato strings and a salad of black beans and mango.  The ribs were tasty and oh-so-tender, the \"strings\" (fries) were perfectly cooked, and the small salad was light and refreshing.

We had a great table next to the street, and our server was friendly and attentive.  A great dinner!"}
{"text":"Summerlicious review! 

Short Version: Great drinks on the pricey side. Summerlicious menu has a lot of options; everything is good, but nothing really stands out. Waiters are all studs. Solid choice, but there are definitely better restaurants to spend your money on for Summerlicious. 

Long Version: They seem to have the open patio on the front reserved for summerlicious, and the regular patrons in the back. Service was slow, but that's definitely understandable with the large crowds.

We picked Byzantium because of the extensive martini menu, and they had so many options to chose from in their fixed price menu. The patio area was nice, but there were a lot of flies flying in and out, and it was really annoying to have to constantly be shooing them away. 

First of all - charging for bread? Really? My Canadian friend said that it's more common in Canada than in the US, but whenever restaurants do that it just strikes me as incredibly cheap. Our first round of bread came over topped with a long, curly hair. We flagged our waiter down and he promptly brought us another batch. Bread came with this delicious hummus - it really had a kick to it; the bread itself was stone cold though. 

I got the poutine, which was pretty good. The best part were the cheese curds - massive, soft and chewy, I definitely felt like I was going to get lactose intolerant eating them. The gravy was very unimpressive - very reminiscent of the gravy from Smoke's Poutinerie, and the fries were thin cut and equally un-outstanding. The PEI mussels came in a creamy white sauce that was delicious when we dipped the bread into it. Mussels themselves were a little small. The beet salad was ... beety. Couldn't get into it but the friend who ordered it really enjoyed it. 

I ordered the BBQ ribs; we also had the chicken and waffles, and the vegetarian moussaka at our table. The ribs came with a pretty good BBQ sauce, but the meat was very dry. Came with some sweet potato wedges that were delicious! The moussaka looked delicious - large pile of steamed veggies and a cube of potato. The chicken and waffles were a little weak - the fried chicken had an overly thick crust; it came with a sweet gravy (instead of gravy and syrup separately) that tasted a little off. 

Dessert was good - we ordered one of each of the three options. The chocolate cake was definitely the best of the three.

Great selection of wine. I got a glass of Zinfandel from California that was surprisingly good. As always, martinis are a must. Prices aren't listed but range from 9-12$, a bit on the pricey side. They're pretty huge and so yummy!"}
{"text":"Was so excited to try this restaurant but ended with disappointment. 

We arrived early for our reservation so decided to have drinks. My friend spilled his drink and the waiter was super nice about it. Afterwards the restaurant got really busy and we felt forgotten. We came here because of all the food options and reviews of this place. 

After waiting awhile to make our food selections, we got our apps right away. We got the mussels and seafood trio. Both were delicious. We waited almost 45 minutes for our main. We understand, the restaurant is super busy at this point but we wish our waiter came by to let us know food is taking awhile. But no contact. We finally got our mains and the ribs and trout were delicious! So we were a little forgiving with the time it took. 

When it came time for dessert, my key lime pie had a smushed fly on it :( sucks. The waiter took it back right away and apologized, but it took another 10 minutes for my pie to come out. Like seriously? By then my friends were done their desserts. 

When it was time for the bill. We noticed 2 of our drinks were taken out. Not sure if this was on purpose and due to the time and mishap with the fly in my pie, or they forgot to charge us lol. But I'm not sure I'd be back after this experience. It pains me to give a place 2 stars, but I'm giving it 3 because the workers are super nice, and the food was tasty. Just the time it took and the little fly, was quite the turn off."}
{"text":"While on my Canadian adventure, my good friend David suggested that we come to Byzantium for dinner. So here I was with David and his partner not really knowing how to cope this crazy culture shock of Canada. I mean no one was checking my I.D. Wait, drinking age is 19 here, not 21. I got it. 

I ordered \"The best meatballs in town.\" Which kind of cracked me up because they really were pretty dang good. I am assuming that they were the best meatballs in town. After dinner, we took a walk through the gay street, or church street. We came back to Byzantium in about 2 hours and in my shock, discovered that it was a dance club! A really fun dance club at that. The music selection here WAS AMAZING. I am talking about remixes of Ke$ha, Selena, Lady Gaga, and just about any artist a gay man could ask for. The highlight of my night was soon to come. I ran into Ryan Gosling! As a American, I had the time of my life here. Canadian men are hot and would not stop buying me drinks (hmmmmm) PLUS I got to grind on Ryan Gosling for one hot minute. 

If you come to Byzantium, come here for the food or come here to dance after hours. Either way, you win."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious 2014.

Aside from service, which was actually great, the food and drinks were a long meeehhhhhh for me. The plates weren't overall memorable, but they weren't horrible either. And my martini tasted watered down. However, Byzantium had great atmosphere, it was busy, had sexy mood lighting and there was an uplifting energy to the place.

We decided to order the $3.00 bread basket, and you know what, it was a damn good bread basket. Tasty flat bread, and insanely fresh herbed bread. The hummus it came with was rank though, that shiz was definitely fermented. Shaking my head at you hummus. My boyfriend still ate it all though because he has a stomach of steel...

My appetizer was the PEI mussel pot with smoked bacon. The bacon seemed like an afterthought? Just sprinkled in amongst the shells? The mussels didn't have any smokey flavour which is what I was expecting...Womp Womp. My pot was also 1/3 empty mussel shells, with one completely closed shell. Like, come on dudes, that shit shouldn't be in there! And my last mussel was sandy as heck! Nu uhhhh! Get dat sand out.

If there's anything Byzantium can do right, it's their proteins. Want a nice over priced plate of fluff sides but with GREAT PROTEIN? THEN COME HERE. I got the Capon Supreme (A capon is a rooster that's been castrated to make their meat taste better? Aye Carumba.) But that piece of Capon was cluckin' good. It came to our table piping hot. Their take on a traditional stuffing had a great rosemary flavour and although slightly mushy, it worked. My capon came with some forgettable hash and steamed veggies. The red sauce was so subtle that it barely made any impact on the flavour profiles when I had it with anything. 

My boyfriend went with the trio of mousse, which was great and the highlight of the meal. And for a change up, I went for the key lime pie. I'm actually not a huge fan of key lime pie, but for what it was, it was pretty nice - good flakey crust and distinct creamy lime punch. 

At the end of the day, it was a nice date and I got to hold my lovers hand under the light of the ~battery powered candle~ 
And the food didn't make me ralph.
You did okay Byzantium, you did okay."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service, great jazz band, warm environment. They really know how to treat visitors to a fun evening meal."}
{"text":"Nice place. A tad pricey but if you want to be swanky on Church Street then you have to pay the price. Service isn't that great, and they run off with your change assuming/hoping that it's all a tip. Not cool.

Great music, good drinks. I think it's a good spot to go if you're feeling a tad classier than Woody's, Slack's or the attempt at class Voglie and don't mind spending a lot (intentionally or not since they can \"forget\" to give you your change).

Food is decent. I don't think I'd recommend going for dinner here, just drinks."}
{"text":"I really am a fan. I've been here quite a few times for dinner and after dinner party. I was here last night for a get together and the experience was superb. The place is quiet enough to have a decent conversation but not boring enough. 

The price is decent. I paid $ 50 for one course and soup. I ordered the lamb chops and though it's a bit fatty (most lamb chops are), I thought it was prepared well. The bread is yummy. The waiter was attentive. 

The crowd is a mixed bag from casual to dressed up. 

I recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a good time at a decent place and at a decent price."}
{"text":"Came here again for Summerlicious and sadly it wasn't as appealing as the first time. 

It was pretty empty when we arrived. After being seated, we were given water... Which had fruit flies in them. I had one in my water and my boyfriend had one in his - we were pretty sure they were from the pitcher and didn't fly into our water while we waited. The server also kept coming back with water and spilled it a couple times on my boyfriends side of the table, also hitting his plate. We noticed that he was a lot less attentive and, erm, nice to us compared to another table.

I got the mussels, ribs and key lime pie. 
Mussels were good and came with a tomato sauce. The ribs were really disappointing - they were fall off the bone but really fatty. The sweet potato spears were not fully cooked as they had a bit of a crunch - not like a crispy crunch, but a raw sweet potato crunch - and the summer slaw was pretty much purple cabbage with vinegar. The homemade key lime pie was good and tart.

The boyfriend got the poutine, chicken schnitzel and strawberry mousse. The poutine was okay, the fries weren't crispy though. The chicken schnitzel was the star of the night - covered in a mushroom saute which tasted more like gravy on a bed of mashed potatos, asparagus and broccoli. The chicken, although panko crusted, wasn't crispy either. Maybe it's just me, but I expect my deep fried foods to be crispy. The strawberry mousse tasted like whipped cream with a bit of strawberry, the flavour wasn't really prominent.

Don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This lovely supper club is just a tad short of being four or five stars. The food was good, the drinks yummy.  The service is excellent but here's the problem.  We had four different people serving us.  All were great but we never felt like one person was truly serving us.  And because of that there were a few problems. One waiter asked us if we wanted dessert after we finished our salads. We reminded him that we hadn't received our entrees yet.  Told one waiter we were ready for the check, but had to remind a different person of the same request. Next time how just one top notch waiter to take care of our needs?"}
{"text":"In terms of service, it was pretty good. The server we had was actually the manager and he was quite friendly. However, sometimes that's not enough. The food at Byzantium was lacking. Disappointing even. 

Prior to dinner, they gave us a bread basket with flat bread and other things. The flat bread and hummus may have been the highlight of the dinner. That says a lot.

We all had the poutine for our starters and it was not bad. It tasted pretty good despite looking kinda blah. It could use more cheese though!

For the main, the group (except for the bf and myself) ordered the lamb but according to my friend the main dish \"got progressively worse. It was not worth the effort\". According to another friend, it was \"aiite\".

But I have to say, despite my friends' comments, I think my pasta of the day (bowtie pasta with chicken) was worse. The chicken surprisingly didn't taste dry and was not too bad but the sauce and the entire dish was just bland.

THe bf was a rebel and ordered the macaroni and cheese from the regular menu. It was the best dish of the night, I think, despite looking like death. And it smelled kinda weird too but...it tasted better than it looks.

For dessert, I got the chocolate cake. The presentation was worse than grocery store-bought cake. It tasted on par with store-bought cake. And that stick of chocolate it came with? What even is it? Does not taste like what I thought it would be. It looks like a wafer with chocolate hazelnut inside? Nope. Nope.

I tried the keylime pie and it tasted like lemonade to me. I don't eat keylime pie so I cannot judge. To quote my friend, \"It ended on a sour note\". 

Would I come back again for food? Most likely not. 

I believe there's a DJ after a certain time. I still wouldn't come back for that. Their women's bathroom smells horrid! I gagged several times."}
{"text":"Byzantium is one of those staples in its neighbourhood, where you can go from dinner into night club, and all you have to do is get out of your chair.

However, it is not the club reason that I go to Byzanitum, or the fact that they have a zillion type of Martini's (their specialty,... and I drink beer).

It is their Steak. If you like steak frites, then this is the place to go. The service is great, and during the summer they have a very nice patio in the back.

The steak, and I always get mine the same way each time, medium rare, with bearnaise sause, is delicious. Not to mention the aole mayo for the frites is great!

In fact, I like to eat it so often, while watching tv, I just get the steak to go. Only thing is, it's a bit pricey at $27 for it...

Just again:
Great service, and atmosphere
Got the drinks / club if you need it
It's more than that, it's a nice restaurant
Have the steak frites. Mmmm."}
