{"text":"I have Celiac disease (recently diagnosed) and man oh man its hard to find dedicated companies. For my 40th my husband contacted Defloured after seeing their goods at the local markets in the city. (We heart their cookies and its so nice to be able to attend the markets and feel like my daughter and I can actually eat there. ) They made us a few cheese cakes to celebrate. One was a little bland and we thought they forgot the sugar, so we contacted them   they graciously refunded the money when we would have happily taken a smaller credit. It was clear they wanted to ensure we were happy which was really impressive.  We learned they had ordered special cheese to ensure no cross contamination which is above what I would have expected. You can feel safe eating their yummy goods and we look forward to them growing in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This place is great! The people are down to earth and very knowledgeable. They do chicken pot pies and other awesome savory goods, if you're not as big on the sweets. Also, a great cup of coffee if you prefer to skip tims or walking further east!"}
{"text":"Hooray for defloured! It turns out just because you don't eat gluten doesn't mean you have to go vegan to get great baked goods in the west end. Defloured is wonderful. They have tremendous variety and I've loved everything I've tired. The quiches are killer and they're definitely my go-to for pies. Man. My mouth is watering just thinking about it."}
{"text":"I frequent bakeries and especially gulten free ones. This one is great! They use mostly organic ingredients and keep everything fresh. Also, they make it so healthy that it tastes like dry sawdust. The following are my favourites:  lemon tarts, salted chocolate caramel tart, quiches, carrot cake....."}
{"text":"Excellent! The owners are super friendly and the shop is adorable. It is also very reasonably priced gluten free foods, which is a bit of a rarity in the city.

The dough is fantastic - doesn't crumble apart in my hands! Stays together through the duration of eating and is very hearty AND tasty. Again, hard to find in gluten free products.

They have an amazing, thick chocolate chip butter cookie and the galettes are what dreams are made of.

Also have various vegetarian and vegan options, for those who are so inclined.

Celiacs of Toronto - worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give these guys 10 stars, but 5 will have to do! First of all, every single thing that matters most to me, ( health, taste, cost, customer service ) they offer perfection. They care to hear beyond just celiac disease, they listened to my other food allergies and advised me what I should not have, which was only 2 things. The price is prob the most affordable in the gluten free community. They are so friendly, great with customers and their knowledge of celiac disease and food allergies. Their food tastes AMAZING. We had some Indian style pockets, they were absolutely incredible. The best I have EVER had. We also had pizza, mini pie, cookies etc and everything tasted so, so, so good! Wish we lived closer, we would be there all of the time. Can't wait to go next time! I really appreciate a place like this."}
{"text":"It can be tedious trying to find \"gluten free\" food that's worthy of a fine dinner -- and fine guests!  So when I recently discovered deFloured at the Dufferin Grove Farmers market, I couldn't believe my taste buds.  The Galettes are one of my favourite \"dishes\" - either as a meal with a salad, or cut up into \"appetizers\" for a party.  Everything I've tasted so far has been delicious!  I plan to explore their store tomorrow, and can't wait."}
{"text":"It's a good thing it is quite a hike out of my bubble to go to Defloured. Otherwise I'd be there every day. So. GOOD!

Their pastry is so flavourful and as flaky as gluten free pastry can be. The sweet and the savoury options are both out of this world. The quiches and savoury turnovers are generously full of mouth popping flavour. Try the kale and feta or the curried vegetable turnovers. The lemon curd tart was creamy, tart, sweet and buttery. The chocolate and salted caramel tart rich, chewy and salty sweet. 

Such friendly and kind service that goes beyond just being helpful."}
