{"text":"For the price the food is excellent! I always get the huge breakfast burrito and the Oreo shake if they have it. The burritos are always huge and the shakes are so thick and creamy. A truly delicious end to every shopping experience at ADFAZ! The only thing I'd gripe about is they are moving!"}
{"text":"This little cafe/Deli counter is inside the American Discount Grocery store and I have eaten here 3 times now with good success. The first time I got a chicken salad sandwich that was stuffed full and delicious and good quality. The second time I went with my daughter and tried the hot dog and she got a burger plate.  The 3rd time I made it over there by 11 o'clock so I could try their breakfast. All three times the meal was delicious, the food was well prepared, and the price was excellent. I can easily see how if you have the time, you could stop and have a breakfast, lunch or even dinner combined with a grocery stop to buy some of their budget priced groceries.  

The breakfast especially impressed me.  Items are a dollar each, you just choose.  2 eggs, 2 bacon, potatoes, French toast, pancakes, make your own combo.  And they grind their own coffee.  I had bacon, eggs, potatoes AND a 12 oz glass of OJ for $4.  Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"In terms of quality and value I have never seen anything like this! Some serious bang for you buck here; I don't know how they are making their profit margins but whatever. Seriously, it taste fresh to me, filled me up, and was quick. It's located inside the grocery store. Quick side note, very patriotic decor so be prepared."}
