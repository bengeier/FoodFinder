This isn't the high end option when it comes to food trucks.  No crazy fish tacos (please guys, get over it, we don't need that many options for fish tacos!), no hyper-local ingredients, no overarching theme (turkey truck, cheese truck, italian truck, etc...)    The food is simpler -  philly cheesesteaks, empanadas, gyros etc...  Most of it fried.

  However,  the heavier-set guy who works there (runs it?) is a good guy and happy to talk with you about the food.  Plus, I really love his inventive empanadas.  The thanksgiving flavored one with turkey, cranberries, and cheese is awesome.  The pot-stickers are great as well.  The line tends to be shorter here than some of the more renowned places which is a big plus as well.  I got my food quite quickly and was happy with it."}
{"text":"The Korean Burger is amazing, a bit messy, but then again I ate in my car. 

My kids had the Belly Burgers, which I tasted. Not bad at all!! The seasoned fries complimented the Belly Burger well.

My wife had the Shrimp and Grits. I don't like grits at all, but this was great.

Coming from NYC, where we have celebrity chef,  run food trucks, I  was pretty amazed by this truck.

My only negative comment is I wish they would hand out more napkins."}
{"text":"If you see this truck coming.... RUN RUN RUN!!!. They came to my work and I ordered a Korean BBQ Burger with Fries. First guy in line and eager to see what they have. As, I stood there and watch customer and customer (that ordered way after me) get there food and get back to there offices, I couldn't help but think that this food better be worth it. It was not, the bun was burnt on one side, the patty was a mushed together piece of meat (not sure what type) and the topping were slathered on to cover up the other problem, that in combination with getting only a few fries is not worth the $9 you'll send and the 20 plus minutes you'll have to wait to get it. Maybe this passes for acceptable at other places but with hundreds of great restaurants and food trucks all around this is a MUST MUST MUST miss."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten yet. But fairly shocked by the wait to get our food. Food trucks are designed to be good food fast. I'm hoping the food is good. Cuz it ain't fast... I'm now eating - I would say the food was good and was worth the wait. Got a gyro and loaded baked potato salad. Gyro wasn't \"traditional\", but I wasn't expecting traditional. So I would say the Gyro was solid. Potato salad was solid too. I enjoyed the grub."}
{"text":"We had Sal's to our community for a neighborhood event, so a big plus is that they do private events.  I do like the fact that they list their whereabouts and menu on their Website / Facebook / Twitter.  Yay social media.

They were the only real food option and the even spanned over lunchtime so needless to say, they were packed.  I perused the menu before hand and was happy to see that they had a no meat option for sweetie.  There was a substantial wait and they were backed up for quite a while which was great to see.

I ordered the \"signature philly\".  For $8.00 and whatever I paid to add the garlic butter it was a bit small.  The sandwich was tasty but it was mostly bread and for $8.00 I expected a bit more especially for a signature dish.  The steak was chopped, moist and seasoned well, grilled onions were a nice compliment and I love me some melty cheese.  It was served with fries that were overcooked and way overseasoned.

Sweetie had the Falafel Pita.  The falafel was fried so deeply that when cutting it with the plastic fork the fork broke.  My little one had the hot dog, which was ok.  I tried it and thought it was fine.  

All in all it was OK for me.  I am glad food trucks are growing in this area and hope to give Sal's another shot."}
{"text":"I got the blacked shrimp tacos. I'm happy that it actually had a good portion of shrimp (some places will be very stingy) it was great for lunch, very filling without making me sleeping. The wait was a bit long considering there was only one person before me. I think it had a tad too much broccoli and needed more queso fresco, it only had a small sprinkle and could barely taste it. Overall not bad but nothing out of this world."}
{"text":"Ate at their food truck in Charlotte.  Decent food but nothing special for the price.  I probably won't eat from them again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the fish Po'Boy with breaded grouper on a buttered toasted bun & lettuce, tomato our homemade remoulade sauce and a touch of malted vinegar & a side order of corn chips for only $8. Can and will have that again!!"}
{"text":"My overall impression of food trucks is that they are good and typically a 4 star rating on yelp.

Food trucks have changed over the years, in my opinion.  They used to be nasty cheap food but lately they are fresh and gourmet ingredients.

Somehow Sal's falls short of my expectations

I was at Triple C brewery while they were here and they said their hours were 1:30 - 6pm.  They didn't actually open until over 1 hour later.  Shame.  I was hungry.

Finally at around 2:30 pm, they opened their window but were still prepping food and said they would be there in a minute.

I ordered a cheesesteak and they said they would deliver it inside when it was done.  About 20 minutes later it was here.

Not the best cheesesteak. Good steak but it was chunked steak and not chopped.   Has some cheese attached but the flavor was unnoticable.    The grilled onions and bread were good but that is not what you want to stand out on a cheesesteak.

Honesty If you are going to advertise something as a Philly Cheesesteak, the least you could at least be authentic.

And have an option for a side.  The store bought corn chips is not a great option and most of mine were thrown away.

Overall experience = 2."}
