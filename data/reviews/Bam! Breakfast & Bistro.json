{"text":"I have went to this restaurant a couple of times the first time went horribly I found onions in my food and I've said in different reviews that I hate onions I ordered an omelet and it contains multiple onions and every bite so I ended up going again to Popeye's down the street he said that was only the first time I decided to give them another chance yet when I ordered my English muffin I found three hairs in it I don't recommend going here it is not clean the service is good but otherwise horrible"}
{"text":"Probably my favourite breakfast place in the east side. Huge portions and such delicious food. It's in a very cute area and you can walk down to the beach after.

No wait here.. unlike all the other overrated brunch places in the beaches/Leslieville"}
{"text":"Have been to BAM several times.
The food here is always great. 
Can't beat the prices for the amount of food that you get.
The service is amazing. The girls are ALWAYS pleasant and smiling which makes the establishment that much better. 
I have never had a bad experience here.
Love it !!
Don't change a thing BAM."}
{"text":"Found this small gem at 3am at work. Went for bf at 8am. Walked into a very comfortable, well run and wonderful small diner with great breakfast. Great eggs Benny. Very friendly Miranda and Nick. 
The experience would be even better without the out of control child yelling and screaming and the mother not effective or even trying to calm her down.

Will be our go to bf place from now on."}
{"text":"Bam has a great breakfast menu.  We had classic eggs and bacon, Colossal Collection, Triple French Toast and Fresh Fruit waffles and excellent coffee. everything came quickly and done perfectly. we did have a short 8 minute wait for seating but this is pretty normal in the beach on Sunday."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite breakfast place in the beach. The comic book style atmosphere is great for adults and children alike. The breakfast here is awesome. The classic bacon, eggs, home fries and toast is absolutely perfect. This place is great for families. Very reasonably priced and top quality. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast and lunch spot. 

Grill cheese had no cheese, just cheese fried in the bread. Odd. 

Off to try other breakfast places, the hunt continues..."}
{"text":"Bam goes the dynamite on this breakfast banger.  Bam! recently opened, and I usually go to Beacher Cafe, but today I was feeling VERY adventurous and I decided to try Bam! because it's new.  Poached eggs passed the looking-like-little-ghosts test and they disappeared in my mouth.  They didn't overdo the sauce on them and service is great.

Their slogan is \"Breakfast and Lunch With A Punch\" there was no punches being thrown, nor could I find punch on the menu, but when I ate those little ghost poached i felt it bam in the face, a good bam and of one of the best breakfasts in the beach.  I'll be coming back and letting Bam! bring the pain to my hunger."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few breakfast places around Toronto, such as Mars Diner, Hazel's Diner, Green Eggplant etc.  Also been several times to the major chains like Cora's, Sunset Grill, and Egg Smart.  I would say this place is the best breakfast I've had so far.

Came on a Saturday morning.  Service was very friendly and prompt.  I ordered the peameal bacon benny, and my wife ordered the smoked beef brisket benny.  You get three pouched eggs, and the meats are thick cuts.  Both were fantastic!  $10.xx.  Their prices are quite decent for what you get.  Taste is phenomenal!  The hollandaise sauce was amazing!  I could drink it.

Can't wait to come back next weekend to try something else on their menu."}
{"text":"Awesome Caesar salad, followed by the best grilled cheese sandwich EVER! accompanied by a real tower of cowboy cut onion rings (too many to finish)!"}
{"text":"There are good breakfast places everywhere, but this one has made everything to perfection. I always like my toasts a lil burnt and they are done just the way I love it! Oh did I mention that it's buttered greasily too? *yum* needless to mention, the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce are heavenly! Definitely love to come back again!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place, initially attracted by the name and decor, and so glad I did! Great service and atmosphere, and awesome food. Great comfort food, highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Three of us came here on a Sunday. We arrived at about 12pm to be seated about 20-30 minutes later. The line was modest; there were only about 4 groups ahead of us. The dining area was both colourful and reasonably quiet, and is very kid friendly as well as being suited to having adult conversations. 

When we were seated our server was prompt, attentive, and helpful. Our orders included coffee as well as fresh squeezed orange juice, a 'make yourself' omelette, a Goodfella omelette, and french toast. Food took about twenty or thirty minutes to arrive and it was incredibly well priced for the portions and tastiness!

My omelette, the Goodfella, had a delightful interplay of flavours. What initially appeared as profoundly depressing amounts of goat cheese turned out to be deceptive; there were three small dollops of cheese on the surface and they also put enough in the middle of the omelette that each bite had a complementary flavour of the cheese, as opposed to the cheese overpowering the taste of everything in it. The home fries had a nice seasoning, though I admit I'd have rather they were slightly crispier than how they were served. The toast was, well, toast. 

One complaint that arose surrounded the french toast. Perhaps it's just the norm for how places around the Beaches prepare it, but it has an eggy taste that is far too strong. It almost tasted like an omelette with bread which is, obviously, non-ideal. Some additional flavouring (a teaspoon on vanilla, perhaps?) would make this particular dish much more enjoyable. 

On the whole we enjoyed coming to Bam! While I'm not entirely certain that we'll be back, simply because of the diversity of selection in he neighbourhood, I'd certainly recommend that people check it out."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood diner. BIG breakfast menu! Bam! is open till 3 most days, so no dinner but you can get it to go. They have take out lasagna, eggplant parmesan, mac & cheese, and more."}
{"text":"We decided to stick with their specialty breakfast options. Going with the mexicano and the french toast trio. Neither of them dissapoints. The french toast had a nice flavoring of cinnamon. The home style potatoes on the mexicano were cooked very well. Nice and soft without being mushy. The service was friendly and quick. Pretty sure both the owners were there as they were taking orders and bringing coffee as well. The decor is very cool inside. The walls were laden with comic books and comic book themed art. Glad we decided to stop here during our vacation in Toronto."}
{"text":"Just average place, fast service, ok food, nothing special. Prices are affordable, but regular coffee is quite nasty, don't try it."}
{"text":"Best brunch place in the Beaches, take it from a local! Great food, massive menu, very generous portions, super friendly service and.... superhero-themed. The best of all worlds."}
{"text":"This is a excellent breakfast spot and very entertaining. For those that like comic books there is a lot to see within the restaurant. I got the French toast trio and a side of turkey bacon. The French toast was good nothing major, but the turkey bacon was amazing. The service was somewhat slow due to there only being one waitress at the time. All in all good spot to eat."}
{"text":"Nice place for breakfast, good portions, price is fair. Nice service, very friendly.My new 'go to' place in the Beach. Sadly, the Sunset Grill has gone downhill over the years, the potatoes there are a greasy mess."}
{"text":"Loved this cute whimsical diner.  Waitress was super on top of things even with lots of tables.  Food was great. I had a few changes to my dish that they accommodated with no additional charges or guff. I always appreciate that."}
{"text":"First time visit this morning. Novel and upbeat decor, kid suitable, and welcoming, friendly staff.

Effiencient service without making you feel rushed. Coffee refills before you even think of it!

And the food... unless you were up at 4am milking cows and hand bombing hay, you ain't leavin' hungry. Good portion size and interesting variety. Tried the \"st peters benne\" and enjoyed very much."}
{"text":"Very nice addition to beaches neighbourhood.  Very funky interior with comic strip style influenced paint design on walls. It's pretty small so you may have to wait a bit before you get a seat. The second you walk in you get an amazing aroma of foods. Service is friendly, and atmosphere is very casual and open. Great for a casual Sunday breakfast."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, and it is consistently a great meal, portions are huge, price is right, and the staff is really cool. Will be going back for sure, try the colossal breakfast."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and it was pretty good. They have a pretty large selection of breakfasts, with many variations on the traditional offerings. My wife had the Mount Olympus - a vegetarian option which she loved. I had the Metropolis, which was kind of a Philly Cheesteak breakfast. The meat had no flavour whatsoever, there wasn't even salt and pepper on it, so although it was cooked nicely with a nice mixture of peppers, onions and cheese, you couldn't taste the meat in it. The home fries had decent flavour but were undercooked.
The staff are very friendly and there are plenty of kids options so it's no wonder there were lots of families there.
All in all the place was nice and I am willing to give it one more try to see if it gets better or not."}
{"text":"My go-to Toronto breakfast spot for a homey breakfast. The restaurant is based in the busy part of the Beaches area, with a comic book theme inside. The food choices range from classic eggs, potatoes and toast to pancakes. They have Bam! Specials, which is their take on classic food/breakfast dishes. If you like eggs Benedict, you must try the Alexander, which is eggs Benedict with spinach instead of the classic peameal bacon. They give so much spinach, which pairs beautifully with their amazing hollandaise sauce. Their potatoes comes as a side with most of their breakfast dishes. These potatoes are seasoned like no other potatoes you will eat at a classic diner, which makes them extremely hard to resist. The staff at Bam is amazing and will make you feel at home! Definitely come stop by Bam and experience what a true classic breakfast should as be!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot in the Beaches. Very cool comic-book themed decor everywhere, which gives the place a ton of beautiful colour. I had the Canuck Eggs Benedict and it was fabulous; 3 perfectly poached eggs on peameal and english muffins, with brilliant hollandaise and home fries. There's a huge range of tasty looking breakfast options with clever names and they all look amazing. Definitely my top choice right now for brunch in the Beaches!"}
{"text":"I came here when visiting Toronto and I would have been here every other day if I lived in the area.

The breakfast was great! I always got 3 eggs and 4 slices of bacon (you can never say no to bacon). I tried the nutella and banana waffles which were yummy.

The prices are great compared to other breakfast places I went to around Toronto. My go to place to fill you up for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Small place and busy so prepare to line up. Parties of 8 will be hard to accommodate.

Eggs Benedict were good...choice of soft, medium or hard. I ordered soft but got medium...but I was hungry so I really didn't mind. My wife and kids like the home fries but I would have liked yhem more crispy.

Me I'd give it a 3 star hut my kids said 4...."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. My fiancé and I walk by this place all the time and finally decided to try it this morning. 

We wanted the table by the window and they cleaned it immediately for us. Service is quick and friendly. We got our food in good time. I ordered the chicken sandwich on rye with onion rings and a side of coleslaw and the fiancé ordered the canuck benedict with home fries. Both were really good. The goat cheese in the sandwich made it so much better. The benedict was served with three eggs. The yolks were super orange and I asked if they were organic, and they were! Extra points there. The peameal bacon was very thick. They serve freshly squeezed orange juice and are nice enough to strain the pulp out. 

The fiancé liked the decor of the restaurant. It's very low key, but there is a lot of superhero art everywhere. They even put up kids' superhero art! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast. Real cozy feel inside the establishment as well and service is well enough. I've been here a couple of times now and they never get my order wrong, never had a wait but very busy place"}
{"text":"We live in the area and sometimes find it challenging to find good, basic food. It's either frozen-to-fried fast food or a place that's been around forever and just hasn't adapted to foodie culture. We decided to try Bam! for breakfast as it got good reviews. I would qualify it as a slight step up from Sunset Grill, with a bit more flavour and freshness (i.e. don't expect anything out of the ordinary in terms of flavour combos or creativity). I ordered the frittata, which I found too dense and cheesy. My husband had the Western sandwich, decent but nothing special. The highlight was the potatoes! They had just the right texture inside and a nice flavourful crust on the outside. Maybe we just didn't choose the best dishes? We would go back but order something else."}
{"text":"What brought me here was the variety of Egg Benedicts that they offer. Not only can you find the typical ones with peameal bacon or smoked salmon but they also have it with bruschetta on focaccia bread, smoked beef brisket, spinach and feta, and even a shredded NY striploin.

No line up on a Tues morning with lots of available tables. We ordered the St Peter's Benny (bruschetta added feta as suggested by the waitress) which came with three eggs and home fries also the Colossal Connection with  three eggs, two bacon, 2 sausages one slice of ham and two vanilla pancakes (you can choose French toast instead), home fries and toast.

When I tried the benny, it was like BAM! I was hit by all the flavors at once. If you don't like tomatoes this is not the dish for you but if you like bruschetta with fresh basil, you'll love it. Hubby is a sweetie and gave me a piece of everything he had so I could try his food too. My favorite was the thick, crispy bacon; the sausage was decent but the ham tasted and looked like it came from a can. The vanilla pancakes were dense like a cake; we prefer ours light and fluffy.

Their coffee was typical diner coffee and refillable. Waitress was attentive but not overbearing. Restaurant was very kitschy with it's comic book/super hero theme and 70/80/90s music playing in the background. A great spot for us Generation Yers, families with kids and comic book nerds to hang out and have a delicious and filling meal."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, a great restaurant. Portions are generous and you have got to love the super hero ambiance."}
{"text":"This is my new go-to for brunch.  I live in the area and kept walking past while running errands-- the comic book graphics and bright colours are hard to miss. A friend of mine wanted brunch a few months back so I suggested we try it out.  I'm so glad we did! Now it's the first spot I recommend whenever friends are looking for a traditional breakfast and a unique and fun space. 
I think brunch is best when you get a little bit of everything, so I always get The Colossal Connection-- Eggs, sausage, bacon, ham, home fries... and the VERY BEST Vanilla Pancakes. Seriously, I would come here just for those pancakes alone.  Some mornings, I wake up and the very first thing on my mind is those vanilla pancakes.  I don't think I've ever gone to a brunch spot that does pancakes well, but these ones are legendary, IMO. 
The service is quick and friendly.  The servers are always near by to make sure that you're enjoying the meal, even when it's super busy on weekends. Also, despite this being a popular spot on weekends, I've never had to wait too long for a table.  Most of the time, we're seated right away. 

Definitely check this place out if you're in the beach!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Took the fam bam visiting from
Montreal. The breakfasts were massive and delicious!!!! Service was prompt as well."}
{"text":"I have been to this place countless of time and it does not disappoint.  Service is fast and friendly and food is consistent and does not disappoint.  Price is decent too!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on a Sunday. It was super busy and we enjoyed our experience immensely. Server was super friendly and was able to help us out with the questions we had.  Portions were very large. Wasn't able to eat everything on my plate. But I did my best trying. Eggs were cooked just the way I asked. The place is fun and bright and full if energy. Totally recommend this place for days that you just need that yummy super sized breakfast!!"}
{"text":"My favourite local breakfast place. The portions are HUGE. The food isn't fancy at all, but just good. It's great for family. It's usually full on weekend mornings but I've never waited too long."}
{"text":"Good breakfast food. Excellent service. Good value. English Breakfast is really tasty with home fries."}
{"text":"Awful service, our food was very late coming out. Portions are large (fit for a super hero) however the \"lunch\" menu is forgettable; stick to the breakfast food. The interior of the place is very creative, any comic book junkie will love it."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance and the comics art on the wall. Their menu is also very creative and the names of the plates relates to super heroes. The food is good too, nothing extraordinary but a good home taste to it and good serving size also. The coffee could be bolder."}
{"text":"I went there this morning.  It seemed like your standard breakfast joint, plus the comic book inspired decor and order names.  The waitress was really nice, and the serving size was really big.  I was happy and surprised that poached eggs were an option even for non-Benedict options."}
{"text":"Family with kids will love this small, cozy and colorful place. Prices were fine, food was standard, service was great, but the vibe in there is unique. They also give kids free comic books. I think we'll keep coming back. They have what appears to be a new way of presenting breakfast and that to me is great!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good and surpassed my expectations. Arrived around 1230 on a saturday and didn't have to wait to be seated.  I had scrambled eggs with hash browns, toast and turkey bacon with a coffee. My girllfriend had the east coast eggs benny and said they were good. I found my meal good but not amazing. The hash browns were not warm but they were tasty and had a little bit of zing.  Would have been much better warm. I like traditional breakfast and this was one was better than average. 

The service was really good and they came around often to fill up coffee. The decor was pretty cool and washrooms were clean. 

I would try this place out if you're headed to the beaches area."}
{"text":"Bam with a punch indeed! Had the Hab Fan Benny - wow wow wow. Portion is huge, but it was so tasty, you will finish it up :)"}
{"text":"I have actually never sat down inside Bam! for breakfast lol. Only had take outs with Ted, who is the senior optician I work with :) He orders Bam! 3 times a week and generously shares his food with me every morning ^_^ He probably secretly wants me fat and thinks that I hardly eat (which is half true... I snack more than I eat meals!)

Ted goes by the same breakfast order every week. I ask him why? He says those are his top favourites... the items are delicious, portions are huge, get his money's worth and possibly healthier than other breakfast joints... so why change? And he is absolutely right! I eventually fell in love with those items myself too lol.

Peameal bacon sandwich on Tuesdays. This sandwich is monstrous! The 3 thick-cut peameal bacons are SO juicy and delicious. And dunk it into a bit of ketchup, OMG, I can't seem to stop eating this one ^^

I believe it is a Western Omelette sandwich on Wednesdays. I love Westerns. The sandwich is so 'meaty'... filled with green pepper, onions, ham and cheese!

Thursdays are French Toast Day with fresh fruits and whipped cream + a side of sausages. Ted says it is his cheat day ^^ I love how Bam! packs the fruits, whipped cream, and syrup all separately... you just have to DIY everything together when you eat :)

Some might say these are just ordinary items... but I say being able to keep the same quality and consistency every day is something I truly admire. I highly recommend these 3 items and I would love to visit Bam! when I'm in the Beaches area again :)"}
{"text":"We regularly visit this establishment for brunch on the weekends. Staff are super nice & attentive. Servers remember us & our favourite dishes, which is impressive considering the number of patrons who visit. The food is very yummy."}
{"text":"I ordered Uber Eats today and got an Eggs Benedict as well as vanilla pancakes to split. The Benny was good - nothing to write home about, but just good. The home fries were slightly bland, a nice texture and well cooked but needed seasoning. I added a ton of salt and pepper at home to make them taste better. The pancakes were pretty terrible. They tasted like McDonalds pancakes. I ended up throwing them out.

Perhaps everything would have tasted better if we had dined in."}
{"text":"Plenty of great choices, effecient and friendly service, clean, and very reasonable.  I would go there again anytime!"}
{"text":"We went on Mother's Day and didn't have a reservation. They managed to find spot for us, a table of 6.  The service was beyond excellent and the food delish. Great decor, nice casual vibe. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place was cute to sit at and eat. The service wasn't all that great. The waitresses looked miserable and the food was a little bland. The pancakes are really good though! Really nice aesthetic."}
