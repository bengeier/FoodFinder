{"text":"Wow, bought a slice of pie, and that thing was HUGE. This place is a small hole in the wall place I found by accident, but soooo glad I did. I LOVE there Pizza, true NYC, get outta here...  The Owner is awesome, great guy, and it's not a chain. This is a must try."}
{"text":"SO happy this place is .5 mile from my house! Excellent pizza and the owner and employees have always been very friendly. We get take-out or delivery 2-3 times a month and it's always been very good. Also, it's near Hamilton High School so my boys like to drop by after school with their friends for a slice of pizza. Get this pizza and support a local business!"}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times. The food is good, and the slices are big. I went in to buy a slice of pizza, the girl at the register can't speak up and was texting the entire time. Then I was told the Order needs to be above $10 to use a Debit/Credit Card. This is Against they're VISA/MASTERCARD agreement. Afterwards the owner yelled at me that \"Its my business and I can do what i want\"... First off you don't yell at the Customer paying you... Second your Business doesn't function without customers!"}
{"text":"We agree with Jessica (8/12) comments.  This was the worst god-awful pizza we've ever had.   We had a sausage and pepperoni pizza.  First, we remvoved the sausage.  Then the pepperoni.  Finally threw the whole awful thing away.  Thank God they're closed for good according to the sign on the front door as of today's date.  The other writers apparently are friends of the former owners.  And, if yelp doesn't want to have honest reviews, the he;; with them.  Don't filter the true comments, yelp."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised in a good way!  Every pizza place says it's New York or New York-style but almost none deliver on that promise.  Being from NY , I know a thing or two about NY pizza.  Jimmy, one of the owners, was super helpful and guaranteed the pizza would be one of the best we've had since moving to AZ last year and he was right.  Great pizza, great garlic knots, great (and meaty) wings.  Hope they decide to offer other flavors of wings as even the medium was a spicy...as Jimmy said it would be.  The garlic knots were fantastic...even without the dipping sauce.  The Fat Boys have earned our pizza business!"}
{"text":"Four words! That's a great pie! Legit NYC! Ranch dressing yum!"}
{"text":"Good Pizza! the slices are the size of 2 put together. I would visit agian when I am in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Super yummy.  We ordered a cheese pizza, wings and cannolis.  Will definitely go back.  Everyone was very nice behind the counter."}
{"text":"The pizza slices are huge, and they taste really good. This might be a pizza you would want to eat with a fork and knife however, because if you try to pick up the slices all your toppings will fall off! I am not saying that is a bad thing however.  The owner himself is always there and very friendly. You don't quite see these types of businesses much anymore, so as a small business owner myself, I support these types of businesses. He will make your pizza personally! It is nice and makes you feel special to have the owner himself make you a pizza.  Slices are always fresh, and made right in front of you, not sitting on a rotating tray like other restaurants.   Dock one star for being anti-debit/credit cards however. I would rather pay a .50 cent fee to use my card than have to deal with a minimum $10 order when purchasing just one slice of pizza. I don't carry cash on hand, and there is no close enough ATM. Perhaps they should consider charging a 50 cent fee instead of a minimum $10 order."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a truly authentic NY Pizzeria since Slice of Bella closed in Ahwatukee in 2010.  We came into Fat Boy's and saw a familiar faces; the location and name may have changed, however the pizza is just as fantastic.  These pies are legit."}
{"text":"Not sure how they do it... BUT... I lived in NYC and this stuff is good, very good. Just like NYC. You will think it's a slice of NYC heaven. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"I don't have enough words to describe this place! The owners are extremely inviting and nice. We had pizza, wings and garlic knots delivered one night and went back the next for Chicken Parm Sub, Meatball Parm Sub and Canolis the next. TO DIE FOR!!!! I have not found any place in ARIZONA for 6 years since leaving the East Coast that had such delicious food. My husband even loved their side salads. Great food for a great price. From the dough to the sauce to the cheese... IT is PERFECT!!! We will be frequenting this place for a VERY LONG TIME!!!!!!"}
{"text":"As bad as it gets.  Unidentifiable Food Objects on the pizza.  Thank goodness it's gone."}
{"text":"Fat Boys pizza is great! The pizza slices are humongous and really tasteful!"}
{"text":"Good New York style pizza.  The crust is thin and a little crispy which I like.  My wife and I came in around 8pm on a weeknight.  They sell by the slice, but only until 5pm Monday through Saturday, so we ordered a whole pie.  The guy at the counter said it would take about 10 minutes, and to our surprise in 10 minutes we had our pizza.  The dining area is not very large, so this is probably not the place to bring the whole family for a pizza dinner, but we will definitely be adding Fat Boys to our delivery list."}
{"text":"AWFUL!!! You people are obviously delusional who wrote the other reviews. I am from New York (Born & Raised) and the only way this would be NY pizza is if it was in a rollerskating rink snack bar!! Junk! Also, I had a piece of curly black hair on one of the pizza slices when I got home!! Called the Fat Boy himself and talked to him and he said \"That happens some time\" and was rude and nasty to me. Told me his employees said I called \"Hours\" later. We got the pizza last night and I called immediately! If you aren't satisfied BEWARE. Fat Boy is very rude and not a professional business owner! I asked them if they are from NY( not to my surprise they weren't) and they aren't even Italian. These people wouldn't know NY pizza if it slapped them in their face. This place just opened and it will be closed for good in a year or sooner. Mark my words!! DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!"}
