{"text":"The only thing to get at this place is the Lebanese pizza (manakeesh)! At $3 - $4, it's a great deal, and the only thing that is consistently good.  In particular I like the zaatar - I like it even better than Paramount's - but I know not everyone is a fan of it (zaatar is basically dried thyme, sumach, and sesame seeds. So you have to like those herbs to like zaatar). I've tried a bunch of the other food and it's pretty sketchy.  The shawarma meat itself is good, but last time I ordered the shawarma plate, the hummus on the side was grey and tasteless, and the tabouli was very sour without much other flavour. I didn't think it was possible to ruin tabouli, but this place proved me wrong!  I've also had the stromboli, it wasn't too bad but nothing to write home about.  Also, while I've never seen evidence that the place is particularly dirty, it just has this grungy appearance that gives me the creeps every time I walk in.  The guys yelling at each other in arabic is also a little intimidating. I'm sure they're nice guys though. =)  In summary, the zaatar Lebanese pizza gets five stars, but the rest of the place gets two."}
{"text":"I had the all dressed pizza made to order.  Wow was it ever good.  One of the best pizzas I have ever eaten, even when compared to places much more expensive.  The price was reasonable and the service was good.   I am not sure why the rest of the reviews were not so great.  Maybe they had the slices and maybe some were not that fresh.  The small pizza made fresh was amazing though, just loaded with fresh toppings.  I would highly recommend this place for some amazing and reasonably priced pizza."}
{"text":"First the bad: It's really hit and miss when this place has their all-dressed slices out. By far the best slice in all of Toronto I've experienced. There's just a great combo of cheese, meat, and veg. Sigh. I curtailed my visits because I really just hate walking in and finding no all-dressed slices ready to go. This is Saturday lunch time. You think you might have your menu items ready?  The good: They've opened up the space with the place next door. The place next door provides  much better natural lighting and it's fun to sit at the window counter and see how many times the Megabus doesn't hit anything (http://consumerist.com/2010/09/lost-megabus-driver-crashes-into-bridge-while-checking-gps-four-killed.html) or immediately get lost (http://articles.philly.com/2010-09-14/news/24974729_1_bus-driver-bus-depot-personal-gps-units) ."}
