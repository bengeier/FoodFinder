{"text":"In my opinion, one of the best vietnamese restaurants in Calgary.  The interior atmosphere is modern and clean.  Service can be occasionally hit or miss, but for a vietnamese restaurant it's about expected, it can be surprisingly good on certain days depending on the server.    The satay noodle soup has a wonderful deep flavor to it, as others have mentioned.  But don't miss out on many of their other great menu items, lemongrass chicken or their grilled pork etc; I recommend those items for dinner.   They are closed on Sundays though so if you're craving vietnamese at the end of the weekend you'll have to unfortunately look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Argh ok it's been years since I've been here and my last experience was really good.  I ordered the same dish that left a good lasting memory which is the vermicelli with shredded pork, grilled pork and spring rolls.  Such a disappoint! Sorry I'm sure lots will disagree with me but they definitely changed their spring roll recipe and it was clearly lacking in any filling or flavour.  The pork was chewy and was not char grilled.   It's clear that they've changed their dishes to cater to their customers which was mainly Caucasians, there was one other table that had an Asian couple. Everything tasted muted if that makes sense.  The portions and presentation was all nice but seriously lacking in authenticity.   Sigh I should know better to just drive across town for good Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I work quite close to here so this is a great go to spot for me. It is usually very busy at lunch, but none the less they are always FAST.  The service is good and consistent. Whenever my dad is in town he likes to hit them up as well.  If you are looking for a fast hot meal, with good service, in a convenient location, with lots of parking.  this is your place. I usually get #63."}
{"text":"Always a busy lunch spot, I have yet to have a bad meal here. Food is fast and fresh, service is not bad but they really want to move you out when the place is busy. Like strong coffee? Try the coffee pressed hot or iced with condensed milk.  Good for a quick lunch or meetings, it is the food that brings me back. Also has a private room for up to 30 and will take reservations for groups of 10 or more."}
{"text":"One of the best salad rolls in town.  Big portions, hot and tasty. Service is hit and miss."}
{"text":"WOW! I'm shocked... I've never been to any restaurant and the OWNER himself  was very Rude and Disrespectful!! He Dose Not care what you have to say bout his food. I found a hair on my pho, bought it to my servers attention she did apologies and said there's nothing she can do. I don't need you to take it off my tab but at least get me a diff bowl? I only had 2 bites and I saw the hair..  The owner came to my table and started YELLING at me, like it's MY hair?!?!! Like really??  I told all my friends and family to never eat here again!!  Very ignorant and rude!! (Food isn't even that great)"}
{"text":"Bagolac has decent food but generally terrible service. I went to this restaurant once years ago and the cook actually came out of the kitchen to yell at me at my table when I sent my tofu back because it was rotten. Just recently I went back having been assured they had recently renovated and obtained new management. We came with a group of 7 and were not offered drinks the entire time we were there. We ordered appetizers and main courses and the server brought everyone their appetizer WITH their main course but there was a 10minute lapse between the time the first person and the last person were served. We were not offered dessert and our bill was dropped off before everyone was even finished eating and had a 15% gratuity already added. Our server was also generally unpleasant and did not smile once. I might go back to this place for take-out but I really resent being charged for terrible service. My advice is to go down the street to Bolsa. Better food and VERY friendly staff. I've only been there twice and the server remembered both my husband and I and what we ordered the last time."}
{"text":"Couldn't find a worse pho house than this one . If you want to get yell at please go there and enjoy . I went with my friend last week literally just open up the menu the waitress says \"you ready\"? I said I will need couple more mins please . She rolled her eyes and sighed really loud to me says \"fine \"then walks away . My friend asks for a pot of hot tea ,she was like why ? Why can't you just drinking the ice water ? Seriously I would never step a foot in there EVER !!!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times with mixed results. The menu is heavy on Vietnamese food (including the usual soups & noodle bowls, plus various curries and stir fries) with some Thai dishes thrown in. The soups and stir fries have been alright in the past, but our latest outing which included yellow beef curry and a tamarind chicken was definitely subpar. The only nice thing I can say is that the food came out super quick. The yellow curry was a dull grey, and the tamarind sauce all gloopy. The server never came back to ask how the food was. The chicken dish tasted different (fishy, sweet, spicy) on different parts of the plate, like the sauce wasn't even mixed before plating. Maybe they were just trying to serve too quickly as we ordered at 8 (they were closing at 8:30). If you go, go earlier, and stick to the Vietnamese offerings."}
{"text":"Best VIetnamese in Calgary I've had - 81 or 82 for sure if you want Bun. Service is decent."}
{"text":"I've had the Satay beef noodle soup in the past and it was one of the best I've tasted. I went there for lunch today ordering the same satay beef noodle soup and it was the biggest disappointment.  The noddle portion was very small, there were maybe 5 pieces of sliced beef, which was very dry and over cooked.  The soup was runny, and not creamy and thick like before.  There was no satay flavour to the soup at all.  The noodles tasted bland and powdery.  Overall, pretty bad satay pho. I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"A wide variety of menu items, some really interesting things that you don't normally see. This place always seems to be busy the staff are friendly and efficient.   Happy with our meal, but nothing that blew our socks off. We will stop in again I'm sure, but more because it is in our 'hood rather than a destination."}
{"text":"Simply the best Vietnamese I've had.  Delicious, large portions and good service.  For the nervous and/or uninitiated, I recommend the number 81.  Mmmm - so good."}
{"text":"Really disappointing. If you're a vegetarian, you'll want to stay away from this place. We used to come here for specifically for vegetarian soup, but they just informed me that their vegetarian menu isn't really vegetarian. They've been giving me beef broth when ordering off the vegetarian menu this whole time.  Won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"The spring rolls have gotten really skinny, like twigs. The beef sate on rice was more like sate sauce on rice.   The seafood sate noodle soup however was quite alright and the Vietnamese coffee was good. The ambience is pleasant."}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken dumplings I have ever had - and I know dumplings... I'm Asian ;) my boyfriend and I will come here just to satisfy our cravings. The servers are friendly and the atmosphere is modern and comfortable."}
{"text":"Haven't been here much, but I have found my experiences to be quite wonderful. I can't think of a Vietnamese restaurant I've been to that's been bad, but Bagolac Saigon has a better edge when compared to others. Most the ones I've gone to are small with average decor. Bagolac is a larger area and the rich brown colours and mellow music make it a nice relaxing and calm place to eat. The menu is huge! They will likely have whatever item that you are craving to eat! The service is a little hit and miss, but never anything worth getting angry over. The quality of food is amazing and comes in a large portion size worth the price. Definitely a place to go eat when you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Very very good! I tried the yellow chicken curry with coconut rice and it was absolutely delicious! I think it's #120 and I asked to substitute coconut rice instead of steamed rice. The dish was just amazing, great flavor.  My husband always gets their catfish hot pot. If you order the hot pot it doesn't come with any rice or veggies so you have to order them on the side. The catfish is melt in your mouth good. Not fishy at all, and really flavorful.  The chicken dumplings are tasty and have a bit of crispness to them, and the salt and pepper seafood is good as well. Not too much breading and nicely spiced. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Are there new owners here? Are there all new kitchen staff? Bagolac was never outstanding but always acceptable Vietnamese cuisine. Today was my last visit to this place........terrible food.......really not even close to acceptable. Don't even ask about the service....... There are too many Vietnamese restaurants in Calgary to ever go back to Bagolac."}
{"text":"Honestly not a bad place.  Outside doesn't look too appealing but designed very well on the inside. Staff is very sweet and caring and food was probobly 7/10"}
{"text":"I love Bagolac! First time I go to a Vietnamese Restaurant that has both great food and nice atmosphere. I know a couple of Vietnamese Restaurnts in town which have great food but the atmosphere is just depressing. In Bagolac you will find good food, nice environment, excellent service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The service was okay, but not great. We waited a long time for the bill after we were done and well past ready to leave. Also, the sun was in our eyes and we requested the blinds be closed and they told us to move down a table which did not help. The food was okay. The Pad Thai my companion had was sweet for my taste.  He liked it okay. The salad rolls were very good. Over-all, not bad but not memorable. I doubt we will return because this was just not a stand out."}
{"text":"Used to be excellent, not so much anymore :-(  Ever since they expanded the quality and quantity has gone down...not so impressed anymore."}
{"text":"Ordered the #52 beef satay to find a hair wrapped around a slice of beef.  I told the waiter, he looked shocked and cursed. Took the bowl away without any apologies.  Came back with new beef in the bowl...I asked him if they also changed the soup. Waiter rudely told me ya and walked away. Heard him curse again as his back was turned.  Although we work hard to avoid it, I understand hair can get in food when cooking. Restaurant work is hard but showing courtesy and respect  is actually quite easy with reasonable customers. The issue is with the waiter's entitled attitude (buzzed sides, hair slicked back, short, stocky...unpleasant smile).  To other Yelpers I'd say Golden Bell is better in taste and service, up to you.  Update: Owner was understanding and waived my meal. The waiter was still smiling as I voiced my complaint, seems like he's a slow learner.   Grateful the owner was professional in the end but we all go to restaurants to eat in comfort and avoid any grief. For the restaurant's sake and the career prospects of the genius waiter, please teach him some manners."}
{"text":"Delicious Vietnamese nommy nom noms. I love that their version of halo-halo is completely vegan and I can eat as much of it as my tummy will allow :). It's not the best in town, but the service is solid and the choices are varied for even the pickiest of the bunch (see: me).   Tucked away near CNF and the Chinook LRT station; I'd probably eat here more if I wasn't constantly trying to eat my weight in CNF Sunflower wraps."}
{"text":"Food is average...big portion. But servers are very very very lousy..they never ask if you re doing okay even though they re literally bussing the table next to you. When I said excuse me...she looked back and pretended that she misheard me and never bother to check back. So we never get our service we needed until 10 mins later. When I need some limes, I can't get my waitress but to tell another waiter to get it for me. When he came back, he brought me one wedge of lime cut in half and did not ask if I need anything else and left. The amount of limes given is so stingy....yet I don't have a chance to tell them to bring more. Never bring us the check so we have to go counter and pay ourselves. Will not come back for sure."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite Vietnamese restaurant in the city.  I love everything I have eaten there. I highly recommend it. Fast service ,always good."}
{"text":"Clean. Fast. Piping hot. Delicious. Reasonably priced. Your eyes will bulge, your mouth will quiver, your gastric system will appreciate the effort. Your feet will take you back for more in an hour."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food. Don't let the strip mall fool you. Really nice and clean inside. The staff is very friendly and the service is prompt."}
{"text":"Asked for their most spicy pho, and got well, uh, duh.  Not spicy nor all that great, but just passable.  I know that they may have adjusted their fare to fit the relatively lame AB palate, but taming down pho bun hoe or their satay pho even a bit departs from the delicious street soups found in Vietnam.  How can this be? If they can sell it to the sea of white faces that frequent their place for lunch, why try to wisen up the lot? As yawning too widely is not good etiquette, just won't ever return."}
{"text":"This is a reasonable place to get a bite to eat.  If you don't expect miracles, you should be happy enough."}
{"text":"This is our usual spot for pho around our Neighbourhood and it never disappoints (except when they're closed on Monday's)  Food is always hot, fresh and tasty while their space is actually super clean and always nice looking. I'd definitely bring a friend who isn't used to asian food here.  I usually get the Pho Sate. Sometimes beef, sometimes chicken. Sometimes with egg noodles and rice noodles, sometimes with just rice noodles. I'm not a huge fan of spice, I don't douce my regular pho with srriacha but this soup has deep flavour, and a kind of spice that'll warm you up, not make you angry. I think they put coconut milk in it too which helps with the flavour that I love! Their regular pho actually good too and their portions are always generous. We like their Bun rice vermicelli dishes too!  Love this place, and Bagolac proves that you don't need to go to a hole in the wall to get good pho!"}
{"text":"Probably my family's favourite pho spot. Mainly because it's clean and the pho is usually tasty. They do have off days however where the broth is not up to par to how it normally is.   Wait staff is average for Asian restaurant standards. There is a young girl that works there that has incredible memory and will remember everyone's order from the last visit. Food comes out quick.   Only thing I don't enjoy that much are the spring rolls. When I think of viet spring rolls, I see fat rolls. Unfortunately, Their spring rolls are skinny and sad."}
{"text":"A - List and an UPGRADE - These guys have the best food in town. The service is about the best anywhere. Each and every time I go in the experience is consistent from start to finish. Just be warned, portions of soup are large and many customers do not take the soup home. This happens often, so if you do not say anything quickly to your server, she will trash your soup! You have been warned. Love this place."}
{"text":"Just great food, service and prices.  Beef Satay soup, No 52 is just the greatest thing ever, but everything's wonderful. The space is newly renovated and looks very nice, but is seems to lack a nod to the menu's traditional roots."}
{"text":"Thanks to my fellow Yelpers and my friend I just had lunch here, and I can definitely say that the food was fresh, the service was very good, and the atmosphere nice and modern. As Kenny M. mentioned in his review the menu is very large, and includes some Thai dishes, and his #82 was indeed delicious!"}
{"text":"I came here with Team Fam and I ordered a Pho Tai Gan (Vietnamese noodles with rare beef and tendon) and an Avocado Shake. First off, the broth here is pretty good, albeit a little oily. The pho comes with the usual suspects of onions, scallions, and green onions and overall I would liken it to something like Thai Son; very middle of the pack.   The Avocado Shake was pretty good. It was a little lacking in colour and I'm not sure if that's just the avocado situation here or if it's just flavouring. Overall I thought the food was an average case of pho but it was very filling having the two in the same meal."}
{"text":"Impressed by the decor, definitely one of the more modern, almost Earls-like of Viet/pho places, and likewise, a bit pricier than most.  still it's worth going back, simply for its gorgeous booth seating and private room.  Ordered the lemon grass chicken/spring roll over rice vermicelli, tasty enough for $11.50.  The iced coffee was also good, just a tad too much condensed milk, but nice thick straw, not those flimsy ones."}
{"text":"When I'm feeling like Vietnamese, there are 5 or 6 places in south Calgary that I'm willing to go to. When I'm feeling like good Vietnamese, Bagolac Saigon is worth traveling to no matter where I am in the city. Whether it's satay noodle soup, vermicelli combos, or stir-fry, I would recommend almost any dish (I've tried about 75% of their menu).  After recent renovations, the atmosphere here is inviting and open. Perfect for large groups or as a date location for 2, this is a great place for seasoned Viet lovers or rookies."}
{"text":"Came here to have supper before our movie at Chinook. It's around four in the afternoon and there's only one other table here other than us. It appears that food takes a while to come out, so we twiddled our thumbs for a good fifteen minutes.   I think I may have chosen the wrong type of dish to get here. As my companion recommended the Sate here. I think I may have some mental barrier with having salad vegetables in my pho... There wasn't as much meat in the pho as I'm used to either. It was interesting having the egg noodles with the rice noodles as well, but I found the egg noodles made the soup taste much more dense and heavy.   My companion got a regular pho. He enjoyed it very much. He said it tasted much better than his past visits.   It did bother me though that all I heard through out the whole meal were the servers talking loudly in Vietnamese behind me. Partly because I think we were seated way too close to the service station.   The interior is the restaurant looks clean and slick. Much more classy than my regular hookups for pho."}
{"text":"It is very large so its good for lunch as you are reasonably certain you will get a table. And busy enough you know its good and people are coming back.   Clean place from what I can tell and I enjoy the atmosphere.   I usually get rice noodle soup or pho.  I have been a few times and I am not dissapointed."}
{"text":"Four stars for Bagolac? Really?  Ok, Yelp rating was the only reason I've checked this place out - and a good reminder to be as fair and careful with my own ratings and reviews, as possible.  The place is clean, all right. Not really crowded, but quite some people inside. Large menu, a lot to choose from - good. Decor... well, I don't eat decor, but it was ok.  Now, I hate it when a waiter squeezes me to a spot which I don't like. And I don't like when a waiter frowns at me when I ask to change the table. Overall, service in Bagolac suck - maybe attempting to be authentic, maybe not knowing the other way of treating their clients.  Vietnamese food places generally provide huge portions, but not so Bagolac - the plates were of normal size. Good quality food, that's true, but nothing to dream about.  So in all fairness, can't give Bagolac more than 3 stars - it is a normal (read - ordinary) Asian restaurant with poor service and limited parking spots."}
{"text":"I love bagolac, I would have to say its probably the most consistent of any of the Vietnamese eateries I have tried. The atmosphere is very pleasant, the decor a little modern/classy but cozy at the same time. The food ! Mm mm mmm! I have never had a questionable bite here once ! It's fantastic!   The variety of food here is staggering! Its much like many other vietnamese restaurants but with a few more special unique items.I almost always get the same dish(#82 noodle bowl)  but have tried a number of their soups and apps when I come here for dates or just with friends. To sum up the food, it's what we know as Vietnamese but they execute it at a higher standard overall, it has a sharper edge.  The service can be a little hit or miss with timing but they always end the night well, sometimes they even bring out the food too fast here which can be annoying but in those cases I just take my time eating it!  Bagolac is truly one of my staples, it's a versatile place that I would come to for any occasion and be perfectly satisfied everytime. Big groups, birthdays, family, dates,old friends, new friends, lunch, snack time.... If you love Vietnamese then definetly try this place out, I can almost guarantee you won't be dissatisfied!  16/30"}
{"text":"I like to think of myself as a connoisseur of satay beef soup. Really, this probably just means I'm cheap and like inexpensive, filing meals, but let's just say I'm an expert, mmmmkay?  Bagolac has one of the best bowls of satay beef  soup in the city. The beef comes out quite rare, is thin and cooks quickly and there are a massive amount of noodles in the bowl. The broth is spicy, very peanut-y and the murky brown-red kind. If you love it, you'll know what I mean. Most places serve either this or  the clear, heavy-on-the-lemongrass kind.  The menu is massive and includes both Vietnamese and Thai cuisine on it. Some of the dishes are best served family style, so double check when you order to see if it comes with some type of rice, or you need to order it on the side. It's worth a couple of visits to get through some of the variety. Even if you love your first meal, don't always order the same thing - there's plenty of delicious choices!  The location is great - within walking distance of Chinook Station/Mall and plenty of parking in front.  Bagolac is huge, so I think it's a pretty good choice for families. It isn't open on Sunday, which has left me feeling disappointed a few times, but I guess we all need a day off..."}
{"text":"RIP OFF!  I ordered the stir fry lemon grass chicken with rice . The chicken portion consisted of three teaspoonful and was cooked in some brown sauce with no lemongrass flavor whatsoever. And I paid $16.75 for this meal, and I'm still quite hungry.  I told the waitress about this and she said that's how the dish is cooked."}
{"text":"I really like this Vietnamese restaurant.. The food was really good, and the service was great. In addition, the prices are ok... I heard that is very busy for lunch, but it is normal If it is one of the best options around... I would go back to this place without any doubt.."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and the food and service are consistently good. It doesn't matter if you're one of the four people in here or the place is packed (and it does happen!), the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff is appreciated. The food is hot and I have yet to have a negative experience. Great little place if you're popping into Chinook or just running around and hungry and want to avoid being hangry!"}
{"text":"One of my favs in the SE! Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the takeout/delivery is always a bit skimpy. Vermicelli is ALL noodles and no veg when you order outside the restaurant. Still... pretty darn good"}
{"text":"I may have to take issue with you there, Tiffany ...  I think Bagolac COULD be the best in town! ... at least for Pho.  I had been to Bagolac a long time bePHO, but didn't remember it being anything that PHO above the rest. I didn't get soup ... I think I had a vermicelli dish PHO lunch.   But on this last visit, I got the pho and it was one of the best I've had in PHOeva, PHO SHO.   Spicy, creamy, nutty, beefy ... it was the kinda soup I end up thinking about PHO the next PHO or five days. Certainly no PHOnies here.  One of the best things about Bagolac though is the cleanliness. The tables are spotless and the food is incredibly fresh, good quality.   Seriously, Bagolac nailed it ... PHO REAL."}
{"text":"Went here at lunch time mid-week, and the place was busy with workers going for lunch.  The restaurant handled the crowd well, and our food and tea came promptly and was delicious.  I ordered the rice vermicelli with grilled beef and spring roll.   I really enjoyed the taste and crunch of the spring roll, and the beef was nicely cooked-not too dry.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and tea, and was delighted by the clean and modern looking interior, and great service."}
