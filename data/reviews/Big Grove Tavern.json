{"text":"I have been here for a Soft Opening dinner and their first official lunch. I was not disappointed by either. For dinner we tried 4 of the 6 starters and all I have to say is that the hash browns were excellent and I could probably eat the pickled veggies every day and never tire of them. The Pate is a must try and the deviled eggs are just perfect. We tried 4 of the soups/salads and while I was not a fan of the seared pork belly, others at the table thought it was very good but the cheesy grits on the bottom were amazing. The cornbread was delightful (almost as good as Black Dog) and the chili just right. I look forward to trying the other items. The entrees were a great size and very well done. I had the pan seared fish which was perfectly cooked and had a side of pickled veggies. The cornbread stuffing on another plate was so good. The chicken was very tasty. The steak was cooked to a great temp. We also had the mac and cheese, they seem to understand that people like cheese and bacon because this dish did not disappoint. I plan on going for dinner many times.   For lunch we were disappointed that the burger had already run out but we will have to go back earlier to try it. The steak sandwich was very good but the star on that plate was the Sweet Potato Chips, they were absolutely delicious. The horseshoe was very good and I especially enjoyed the sauce. I will be heading over there again for lunch very soon.  This place is a great addition to downtown Champaign and a great replacement to Jim Gould's. The decor is very well suited to the atmosphere the place is trying to convey. I love that they expanded the bar. The prices are a bit high compared to some of the other places downtown but the food is of such a great quality that it is well worth the price.  My biggest disappointment is that I am always too full to try the desserts because they look very good."}
{"text":"Last time I reviewed Big Grove, I gave it 4 stars because it was a pretty heavy meal. There just wasn't much on the menu for a gal trying to - oh, I don't know - wear a bikini in her lifetime. But the food, ambience, and bar were/are SO good, that I kept going back. Happily. Frequently.  Well I am here to report that the food gods must have heard me, because BGT has added some lighter fare. That is the reason for my update and the star increase. They've added some fish dishes and a couple more vegetarian dishes. Whether the fish is a special or the regular entree, it has consistently come out moist and not overcooked. (That's a real bugaboo with me. I have been known to send a fish dish back 3-4 times - in Chicago, no less - because the fish came out overcooked. Bratty, probably, but seriously: overcooking fish and then trying to charge me a small fortune for the privilege of eating dry fish??? I don't think so, Fancy-Schmancy Chicago Restaurant.) Anyway, I'm delighted that BGT doesn't do that. I still like their fried brussels sprouts. Ok - I still LOVE their fried brussels sprouts. I'm sure they aren't nearly as healthy or non-fattening as I like to hope (nothing that good could be), but I'm going with it. And their sweet pea risotto is another solid addition (although not quite as consistently creamy as I would hope.)  I have read that other reviewers don't like the lights or decor.  I still do.  That must be a taste thing - one I share with a lot of folk, I guess. I've noticed that BGT seems to attract a lot of people - and that they tend to be a younger, more creative, more stylish crowd. I mean, even the guys seem to dress up a little at BGT. They actually wear button-down shirts with their wrinkled cargo shorts instead of \"least dirty and faded to a possible blue but maybe gray\" illini t-shirts. (What is it with guys not wanting to dress for girls these days?)  I like that about BGT. I wish more restaurants in Champaign aspired to bringing out the cool in people rather than to being yet another variation on Guidos/Destihl/Esquire/Billy Barooze/Jupiters. But given that the last two restaurants that opened were Five Guys and Prairie Fire, I don't hold out much hope. Until then -yay for BGT!"}
{"text":"Big Grove is fine, but that's all it is.  Unfortunately it just doesn't make sense to pay $15 for just a good hamburger.  If it were less expensive; maybe more in line with Blackdog or Dublin O'Neils prices it may have gotten 4 stars (whereas those other restaurants get 5 stars and 4 stars respectively).   We started off with some deviled eggs that were good, and a fresh baked pretzel that had an unappealing mustard sauce.  I'll take Gulden's over that mustard sauce any day.  I ordered the burger and my girlfriend ordered a chicken salad sandwich. The burger was actually pretty good, cooked medium, with an egg and some onion maramalade on it.  The fries were decent but nothing to write about.  The chicken salad was just a terrible sandwich.  Maybe one small scoop of flavorless chicken salad on hard toast for $9?  Get that thing off the menu.  Seriously.  People who order that sandwich will not come back.   The sweet potato chips on the side were pretty tasty though.  Overall, not as great as I had hear, though maybe the chicken salad ruined the experience.  You want a burger, go to Blackdog or Farrens for a comparable one that costs half the price.  Want chicken salad better than this, go to your local gas station and buy a pre-made chicken salad.  All that said, I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was done to perfection. The wait staff was very attentive and prompt. I would recommend Big Grove for a casual evening or a formal night out."}
{"text":"On Wednesday, July 11th a group of seven of us went for dinner. After a week of oppressive heat we were happy to be able to enjoy the weather and sit outside. It was great.   We started with the tater tots and deviled eggs for appetizers. I loved the tater tots. They're not your typical frozen tots. They had some kind of apple puree sauce on the plate. Initially, I was skeptical, potato and apple together? It was delicious though. Holy cow. I really enjoyed that. I wish more than 4 came in an order though. The deviled eggs were nice, also. I really got a lot of the sweet pea flavor. It sounds odd but it was great and added a freshness to the egg.   For dinner, several of us got the burger. Ohhhh my gosh. It was great. Cooked to the perfect temperature. It was a combo of bison, pork, and beef. The red onion marmalade on top was awesome. It added a sweetness and a lot of great flavor. A couple other people had the fried egg on top and they enjoyed it. The bun wasn't store bought and tasted homemade, very similar to what my husband bakes. It was nice to have a bun that doesn't disintegrate. The hand cut fries that came with the burger were the best fries I have had in years. Another friend INHALED the white fish. I didn't taste it but he said it was great. Someone else got the pork belly and kohlrabi gratin. She said it was great and was really happy with her choice. I wish I hadn't been at the opposite end of the table so I could have stolen a bite. It looked good.   For a cocktail I had the Tavern Infusion. It was great and refreshing. There was a good selection of beer and wine, too. I stuck with one cocktail and water though.   It was a nice touch when the owner came around to the tables and said hi and checked on us and other tables. She seemed really nice.   Everyone at our table enjoyed the meal. We will definitely be back again, hopefully sooner than later."}
{"text":"I don't think the food was terribly special, especially for the price. We tried two appetizers: fries and the fried fish. They were good, not great. Entrees, we had the pork chops and the roasted chicken. What made both of these dishes great were the other flavors in the dish. So to me, it seemed like the chicken;pork was more of a \"side\" than the main highlight of the dish. Overall, the flavors were really nice, but it wasn't anything terribly special.  I would give this a 3.5. I might try this one more time and get something new, but if my overall impression is the same, it'll be the last time.  So far, I preferred the other place that used to be there."}
{"text":"I have dined at Big Grove twice now. My first experience was good, but my second experience was not so great. I went there for dinner on a Saturday night and order the chili and the whitefish. Both were very tasty, and had that been my only experience with Big Grove I would probably have given it a four or five star rating.  Unfortunately, I went there for lunch and had the chicken salad sandwich. I wish I had read the other reviews about it before I ordered.  The chicken salad was absolutely flavorless, and there wasn't much of it. The bread was dry and tasteless. Moreover, the dish cost $9.00.  I hope the owners are reading these reviews, because the chicken salad sandwich is consistently getting bad reviews, and needs to be revamped or taken off the menu altogether."}
{"text":"I went to Big Grove last evening and it was okay, not good, not great but okay.  The food is supposed to be from local farms and made fresh from the kitchen.  I had the tavern burger which comes with a mix of bison, pork, and beef into a patty.  I ordered it medium and it came out medium well.  The burger tasted on the drier side despite having the fatty content of pork mixed into the patty.  The fries that came with the burger were delicious.  My wife had the roasted chicken and it was good.  The vegetables that the menu said that came with it were not the same.  The portion size for both meals was pretty large, but despite that it wasn't as good as I hoped it would taste.  The drink menu was also pricey compared to the other restaurants downtown but they do offer different sizes if you want a taste."}
{"text":"Tried Big Grove Tavern last night for the first time - two around fifty year-old couples.    - We wanted to sit outside, lovely evening, but BGT has very few tables outside.  I guess they must not have bought Jim Gould's furniture because JG had a large area of outside dining.  So they put two tables together for us but didn't have enough chairs so they brought one out from inside - it wasn't the correct height so made for awkward sitting.  - I read about the popcorn they bring out as free munchies.  Last night's was rosemary - I was worried because that can be a really strong spice, but it was good, couldn't really taste the rosemary.  It was funny though, BGT serves it in tiny pails which the waitress kept replacing over and over as there wasn't much in each tiny pail.  Might as well go to bigger buckets and save yourself some effort?  - I would describe the menu as eclectic, pricey, and limited.  For people with big budgets / high-end taste I guess it will work.  But for middle-class Americans, like myself I don't know how people can afford it / go there very many times per year.  Our bill for two entrees, one side, two iced teas, no dessert -appetizer - salad/soup - alcohol -- was close to $50 with tip.  We were just wanting to have a decent dinner before a movie and not go to a chain restaurant.    - On the positive side, the food was very good.  My husband had the free-range roasted chicken and I had the mac and cheese w/ an asparagus side.  Very well made, very high quality.  But (you knew there'd be a but?), my husband's chicken dish was described on the menu as:  free-range roasted chicken w/ herb dumplings, asparagus, mushrooms, fingerling potatoes, & roast chicken jus.  For $18 , there was ONE fingerling potato cut in half, ONE asparagus cut in half, and three dumplings.  He was still hungry after he ate it.  Since this restaurant does not offer bread (cornbread is available, for purchase of course), there was nothing else to fill up on.  Had we ordered salads our bill would have approached $75 for a mid-week meal.  My mac & cheese and asparagus were also very good, excellently prepared - asparagus grilled just right and sprinkled w/ I believe sea salt and pepper.  But, I was trying not to spend too much - if I had ordered a salad and some cornbread my bill alone would have been close to $25.  BGT and Bacaro and Carmon's Bistro , with all three you receive so little food for the price you pay --  I want to love them all because the quality of the food is sooooo good but we just can't afford it.    - The biggest faux pas of the evening though, which I was surprised to not see mentioned in the other reviews of BGT on this site, was \"pitchin' for the kitchen\".  Has anyone else ever heard of this??  We have not..... and we eat out a lot here and in other cities.  Not only was \"pitchin' for the kitchen\" mentioned at the bottom of the menu but our waitress had to point it out to us as well.  What?!!!  So awkward.  One of our companion diners said it put a sour note on the dining experience for her.  It came off as -- the restaurant doesn't pay its kitchen staff enough that they ask for tips?  We are already paying the current 20% for wait staff tip and now kitchen staff is going to ask too?  Un-freaking-believable.    I doubt we'll be back any time soon.  Silvercreek is just as good and you can enjoy their homemade bread free.  And also actually be full when you finish dinner......................"}
{"text":"A great place for brunch but also a place with a refreshing philosophy of using as many fresh, local ingredients as possible. The brunch menu changes weekly, so you will always have new exciting options. Some favorites of mine are the fried Brussels sprouts with truffle aioli, chilled beets with crème fraîche, deviled eggs and to drink, the Glider. My husband loves the tavern burger. An added bonus is the little tins of fresh popcorn - a particularly good flavor of the day was bacon-coffee popcorn. It was mind-boggling how good that popcorn was! They have great specials, too. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have only been their once but I have no desire to return. I feel as if they want to be so different that they do unusual things to food which is not tasty. The establishment seemed very clean and the staff I encountered was very nice."}
{"text":"Had a great time here tonight!  Our server, Jillian, was super friendly and nice.  We showed up close-ish to closing and felt welcome and not rushed.  I've been traveling for work quite a bit from Chicago out this way lately and will def be coming back.  Half price wine on Sunday?  Awesome!  Had the deviled eggs, skirt steak and the burger.  Jillian suggested ordering both medium and I am happy we did.  Perfectly cooked.  We split both entrees and enjoyed them very much.  The burger was super tasty and really loved the sauce they put on it.  Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"I had a so-so experience before and hadn't been back in a few years but this recent visit was really special. One thing I loved was how kid friendly this restaurant was. It's always difficult going out to dinner with kids- but Big Grove made it easy. Our kids ate for free and they played in the public outdoor space while we sipped wine. The food was top-notch. The server and hostess were friendly and accommodating. My only issue was that there is a rather arbitrary rule that kids only eat free on certain days before 7. We didn't realize this until we received the bill. The manager was very nice and comped the meals but I would still suggest that the restaurant change this time limit to avoid confusion. This wasn't explained when we called or on the website in which the information was posted. Otherwise excellent service, staff, food, and an all around memorable and wonderful dinner.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, Big Grove was distinguished from other Champaign restaurants by its consistency and attention to detail.  Now?  Not so much.    Took a friend from out of town, and we had a meal that was... just embarrassing.  The hyper energetic waiter called our attention to a special--pork belly ramen--and told us that it had \"thick noodles\" and that it was awesome.  So my friend ordered it: what came had no broth, a wan pile of glass noodles, and an overcooked pork chop instead of pork belly.  So, to sum up: pork belly ramen is not in any way related to ramen and has no pork belly.  Whatever.  Maybe if you order a steak, you'll get a hotdog!  It's like playing dinner roulette!  Fun for the whole family!     My meal was just ok, a spicy pasta dish that was a bit too sweet for my taste but which at least bore some resemblance to the menu description.  Anyway: I think this place is basically over as a real option in town, other than the bar."}
{"text":"With an emphasis on locally sourced foods, and a chef from California, we were hoping the local food movement could come to Central Illinois as successfully as it has in Northern California: excellent, innovative, and well prepared food that supports local farmers and ranchers while often exceeding the expectations of diners. Alas, it is not to be.  In spite of many available tables, we were seated in a dark and cavernous (all in black) alcove.  Although elsewhere it was the bright light of day, we were barely able to make out the menu in the darkness.  We ordered wine by the glass to start; they waved the bottle over the glass and delivered a very small quantity for a full price pour.  Actually, I like the option of small-glass, but only if they offer the option of paying accordingly...I've had larger pours at free wine tastings around town.  Illinois is beer country, and as they are going local perhaps we would have been better to order a local brew.  We waited a long time for our food, allowing our meager splash of wine to warm in the glass so as to save the few swallows to have with our meal.  At long last when it arrived, the spouse's was pleasant enough but mine was not at all as described.  I had ordered the chicken salad on wheat bread with greens; one of the few sandwiches that did not say it was served with chips. All flavors were erased by a thick layer of Dijon mustard and it was served on very dried out toast with chips on the side.  The \"greens\" were a piece of lettuce inserted between the mass of mustard and the dried out bread.  The person at the next table ordered the same dish and had the same impression, asking the waitress where the greens were and commenting on the dried out toast. It was supposed to have tarragon and other interesting ingredients, but every flavor was eclipsed by the strong Dijon mustard.  Don't know if it was the worst lunch I had since moving here last summer, but it was clearly the most expensive bad lunch I have had, approaching $50 for two sandwiches--one nearly inedible--and a smidgeon of wine. This was very expensive for mixed quality, not a good value.  Pluses: I like that they are trying to source from local farms, although I missed having a fish or seafood option on the menu.  The staff was very friendly.   Minuses: Expensive, very small portions, descriptions on menu not accurate, food quality uneven, some bad seating locations.    I gave it two stars for the effort to source locally and the friendliness of the staff.  I a willing to give them a try again in a couple of months to see if they iron out the kinks, but only if I am feeling extravagant."}
{"text":"Went for lunch last week...maybe the chef has changed since the soft opening as I found nothing overwhelming about the menu and would agree with one reviewer who described it as expensive and limited. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and it was described as coming with mixed greens since I'd rather have that than sweet potato chips and there was no salad when I got my sandwich. When I asked the waitress she said my salad was on my sandwich...which did have a piece of lettuce on the bottom. Besides that my sandwich was very dry and tasteless. My lunch mate wanted a cup of chili and was told emphatically they only had bowls but when it arrived it was the smallest cup of chili I have seen and for 7$?  The cornbread was bigger than the cup Another person in the party had the burger.  The 12$ burger. When it arrived it looked like a slider.  I do think he said it was good, but there are far better burger for a better price than 12$. Our bill for lunch for 4 was 70$. Way too expensive for lunch. Even a NYC lunch but the food was not worth it at all.  On the way out a couple diners seated next to us said they couldn't wait to get on their Facebook accounts to let people know how bad this place is. And we agree. I give this place 6 months. Save your money and go to destihl or any other burger joint for better food"}
{"text":"Had dinner for two there. Foods were good and exotic. Like the new experience. Don't know why not very many customers though. Maybe the price was a little high."}
{"text":"Had yet another horrible experience at Big Grove a few weeks ago. My friend wanted to have brunch here for her birthday so I called weeks in advance and they told me for a party of 13 we'd either have to come at 10:30 or 1:30, so I chose 1:30. Then when the day came for brunch, 15 minutes before our reservation I got a phone call from a very apologetic hostess who was calling to inform me that they had run out of most of their brunch items. She put me in touch with her manager (her idea, not mine) and he could not have been more rude. This was now 10 minutes before our large party was supposed to dine at their restaurant after having this reservation for weeks and he barely even apologized and blamed the hostess for calling me. After a frustrating phone call with him I was ready to go anywhere else but my friend still wanted to go and it was her birthday so on we went. One of my friends got there before me and they informed him that they weren't sure if I was coming because I was \"very upset\" about the menu, which I thought was uncalled for. When I got there I was promptly ignored for a good what felt like five minutes before the hostess looked up and seated us. I was expecting the manager to stop by our table to check in after the extremely poorly handled debacle, but he never did and of course the service in general was sub par and the food was mediocre. Will not be coming here ever again."}
{"text":"We went for a meal on Sunday afternoon about 130.  Be forewarned that they don't have their regular lunch menu on the weekends, just a smaller brunch menu.   We each had breakfast  burritos, and they were quite good.   We also shared a pecan cinnamon roll, and it was awful.   It was cold and hard, and i wouldn't have been surprised if someone told me it came from Sams.   The most disappointing for me was the coffee, as it was only lukewarm.   I should have asked for a new pot, but by this time our waitress wasnt around much.  I feel like she probably just needed trained better ( she came frequently when not needed and infrequently when required,  she also didn't know how to read when the table was ready to order or needed anything).    All that being said... it was a nice restaurant and i would return for brunch.  I'm not sure it's  worth the dinner prices,  but it's definitely worth the brunch prices."}
{"text":"Divine crab cake eggs benedict. Wonderful service (Tricia) ...bottomless mimosas were wonderful. Thank you Big Grove."}
{"text":"I had the fish which was good., but the relish was strange.  It was different kinds of radishes .  Small portions.  The dessert  was great."}
{"text":"Incredible! Love their use of local products to make delicious food. My group had outstanding service from all staff members, which made our experience even better than our enjoyment of the amazing food!"}
{"text":"Upscale Tavern with amazing food! All the food is locally sourced. They have great bar snacks. My favorite is the gourmet popcorn. They change the flavor daily. We had lemon zest and cumin flavored popcorn. They have a bison, pork and beef burger that my husband loved. The butternut squash and pumpkin soup was delicious! Highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"I'd highly recommend Big Grove for cocktails. I think they have the best drinks in Champaign and no competition really measures up to what Big Grove offers. But Big Grove's whole ethos is defined on its local food being delicious, and for all the times I've eaten there I've never been truly impressed. Their burger was the best thing I've eaten there, but even it paled in comparison to other local options."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite restaurant in champaign. Unique upscale cocktails & food. I love the farm to table concept. Menu changes based on what local foods are in season. I haven't had a bad meal yet. My wife likes to order whatever version of pork belly is on the menu. Something different for the area that you have to check out!"}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviews about the quality of their snacks, only so-so. This review is about their service which really needs improving. They seem preoccupied with where you sit. When I arrived and told them we're a group of people coming in for happy hour, the server and his manager tried to steer us toward high bistro tables. The restaurant was basically empty, and I asked if we can instead push 2 regular tables in the bar area together so everyone in the party could talk with each other. They seemed annoyed and the manager made a point of saying she would check to make sure our server \"didn't mind.\" Did I mention the restaurant was empty? I would think  they would want customers and make them feel welcome. Afterwards when the bill came we asked why they didn't charge the advertised happy hour prices. The server said that's only if you sit AT the bar. We sat at tables. Wow. Bottom line: This is not a customer-focused place."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch with friends from SoCal here yesterday.  Two of us had the Tavern Burger and two had the Mac N Cheese.  Three of us opted for the bison chili with cornbread for apps and one chose the watercress soup.  We also shared an app of deep fried grits.  I thought the cornbread was tasty but a bit on the dry side.  The chili was great!  Tavern burgers were a blend of beef, pork and bison and were cooked to perfection.  The Mac n cheese was coated with bread crumbs and baked just right and the portions were quite large.  I also had a side of sweet potato chips.  They came out just a bit soft but finished with a nice crunch.  The wine and beer lists were both substantial with great local and regional brews and lots of interesting choices on wines.  Looked like lots of great sounding house cocktails and specialty drinks offered as well.  We will definitely return for an evening dinner and sample some of those as well as some more great entrees with local ingredients finished to perfection!   The one area that might just surpass the food is the service which is outstanding.  Our server's name escapes my memory but he had an interesting tattoo on his left forearm.  He was truly on top of his game for so early in the day."}
{"text":"Big Grove is one of my favorite restaurants in downtown Champaign. I have always found their ingredients to be fresh and the rotating menu always has some very tasty seasonal dishes. I particularly like their burgers!  They also maintain a solid sampling of local beers on tap, making this one of my favorite places to go for a happy hour on Fridays.  In the summer, they have a very large outside patio."}
{"text":"I went for the first time today and right off the bat I can tell that the decor was really well thought out and beautiful. When we were seated our server told us how most of their ingredients were from local farms and I love that! The service was definitely 5 stars!   My boyfriend ordered the Risotto with chicken and when he cut into the chicken..it was a little bit pink. We told our server this and she promptly gave us a new dish. (No big deal there because when we finally got to eat it, it was amazing!) I ordered the Veggie Mac and Cheese and the spice was just right, not too cheesy or fattening.  We also ordered the pickled vegetables, which I didn't think much of and the pork belly which was pretty good but the price was definitely steep (2 pieces for $10)."}
{"text":"Have eaten at Big Grove Tavern several times now and have never had a bad meal. Each time our expectations were met or superseded. We ate there last on New Years Eve and had awesome service as well as a fantastic meal. The roasted beet appetizer was incredible. Their menu is not extensive, but that tells me that what they do choose  to prepare will be done right. I would recommend BGT whole heartedly!!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Big Grove and it was a great experience. First off, our server, Carolyn provided great service, regularly checking in  with us to see if we needed anything else (service is a little like the Three Bears' beds, too much, too little, or just right and Carolyn provided the right amount) and provided well-articulated descriptions of the menu items. Although the portion sizes seemed a bit off (the carb to main item ratio seemed a bit off for both my friend and my dishes) the food was flavorful and the desserts (vanilla ice cream and the olive oil cake) were delicious and worth sticking around for. We opted to eat out on the patio and so, the combination of good food, old friends, great weather and awesome service made for a great lunch break."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch on a Saturday, and at first I was completely stunned at the tiny menu.  There were 5 entrees, and I didn't think any of them stood out.  My husband ordered the Tavern burger (beef, Bison, and pork) and I ordered the Grilled Cheese because it was the only thing besides the burger that I thought I might like and it was only $8.  We each got a deviled egg ($1 each) and they were good, a little on the salty side though.  We also enjoyed the small bucket of popcorn you get for free.  Hubby's burger came with a huge pile of fries (good because the burger is $12, cheese is $1.50 extra) and I got a mixed green salad with my grilled cheese.  The vinaigrette on the salad was a bit salty as well.  The food was okay, the service was great, I like the fact that everything is locally sourced.  We might be back for dinner sometime, but we'll see...it's very expensive."}
{"text":"A solid two stars, yes!  First of all, I'll say the taste of the food is pretty good.  The quality of the food and drink was above average.  The popcorn presented when we arrived was nicely flavored with spices, but came in a rather small tin.  We began with two cocktails which were delicious, but for the area, were either too small, or overpriced.  Thus began the battle of the perceptions in regards to overpriced versus tiny portions.  We did not have appetizers because in my mind, they were a little pricey.  Deviled eggs for $1.00 each?  Ok, I get it, these are local eggs.  But half of an egg with a little mayo and some flavoring mixed into the yolk for $1.00?  Nope, still expensive.  Fries for $4.00?  Nope, not for this guy.  Besides, Illinois isn't know for their potato harvests.  $9.00 for a mixed greens salad?  How about make that salad plural and give us a couple of them for that price?  Moving on, I wanted to try the famous \"Tavern Burger.\"  However, at 7:45 p.m., in a restaurant which wasn't packed out, they were out for the evening.  Really?  Hmmm, how strange.  You mean the cheapest choice for dinner, the one item which was mentioned in the newspaper and was considered your house specialty, and, worth mentioning again, your CHEAPEST dinner choice, was out so early?  How very strange...  I guess that meant I would have to choose a more expensive option. (And, incidentally, our server told us you made it fresh every day.  So, why didn't you just whip up a little more of the mix?  Or, does the bison truck come very morning?)  We chose the Trout and the Pork Loin.  First, the portion sizes were tiny.  For the price of the trout, we expected at least half of a small trout for $18.00.  What we got was about 1/3 to  1/2 of a side of a small trout.   As for the pork, we received what amounted to about a 3 oz. portion.  Now, I understand it's local.  But, and I'm saying this as a consumer and a cook, pork is not expensive.  There is no grocery store in Champaign where you can go and find any cut of pork out pricing Beef.   And, the accompaniments, the turnips, chicory and cornbread were nice, tasty and well presented, were cool and not substantial.  The pork, for the price, should have been at least twice the size, and even this would have made the price extravagant.  We shared a bottle of white wine from the menu, the wine selection being very good by the way, and also had dessert.  I had the Ice Cream Sandwich (which should have been slightly warmed so as to not have been served rock hard), and my guest had the Pot de Crème.  Both were delicious!  Overall, I believe our bill totaled more than $140.00.  Can you believe it?  $140.00 for two cocktails, one bottle of white wine which retailed for about $13.00, two main dishes and two desserts.   Fine for Haute Cuisine, not fine for a tavern.   We found the service to be just about perfect, as our server was attentive and respectful of both our needs and our privacy.  The atmosphere is great in this place.  The food is good, but not great.  With the expanding options in the area, especially the great options across the street, there is little to nothing to draw me back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Great cocktail list, an amazing burger, and a fantastic play on a wedge salad.  Friendly and knowledgable staff and a comfortable space make it a must if in Champaign."}
{"text":"We decided to try this out for brunch before a noon Illini game. We sat at the bar and allowed an hour and a half before we needed to be at the game...we should have given ourselves longer. The restaurant was by no means packed, but it took an hour to get our food, and we were offered no refills on water.  When we asked the bartender questions about the menu, he responded with an indifferent \"I don't usually work brunch\"...alrighty.  The food was delicious, but bordered on cold by the time it arrived. Bartender seemed to be tinkering around with menial tasks to avoid contact with customers.  After asking for the bill and producing a card, he walked away, forcing us to leave cash in order to get to the game.  It's gameday in Champaign, and we were decked out in Illini apparel...generally, servers know there's a game and will do their best to get you going.  I think in the future we will stick with Destihl, where service is always top-notch."}
{"text":"I was astounded by the amazingness that was their posole soup. The service itself seemed a little slow, but the food more than made up for it. The posole is not an item normally varied on their menu, but when it's available I recommend it highly along with the amazing cantina burger"}
{"text":"The inner design of this restaurant is really spacial, comfy and fresh. Good service and the food I ordered was pretty innovative and tasty. It is a nice place to chill with your friends and family."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the tavern burger along with some mac and cheese and it was delicious! Can really taste the freshness of the food and the waitress was delightful! Made our dinning experience even better !!"}
{"text":"Great location, nice atmosphere, great spot for eating outdoors.  We initially had to wait on a table and had a drink at the bar.  They have a good beer selection, although the bartender that helped us was a little bit \"too cool for school\" :)  When we were seated at a table outside our waiter was extremely helpful, nice and attentive.    Big Grove's thing is \"Fresh Farm-to-Table\" and they don't disappoint.  There are a lot of interesting dishes on the menu and everything we tried was good.  I recommend the fried cheesy grits- really good. The mac and cheese was a tad disappointing for me- too heavy on the bread crumbs.  Overall a nice experience- we will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Pros:   The environment is fantastic. If you want to go to a classier place with dim lighting and a truly romantic ambience, this would be a great option to consider. The strings of lights add a certain charm, as does the popcorn served before meals in endearingly tiny tin pails. The restaurant has a classy yet rustic element, which is further enhanced by the use of linen napkins instead of paper, a moderate noise level, and a seating and bar area that compliment each other well.   Cons:   Low quality food for a high price. As someone who loves food and is always eager to explore new options, I was disappointed that for the cost of my meal, it was far too salty for my tastes. I enjoy spices. Salt isn't a problem. A problem does exist, though, when I find myself consistently reaching for a glass of water to wash down a chicken risotto that tastes of salt and little else. For an approximately $18 dinner, I expected more.   Perhaps other foods on the menu are better tasting or better seasoned; however, with the chicken risotto seeming like a tasty option that fell within my price range, I was greatly disappointed. By the end, I was chugging water and eating popcorn out of the charming little pails more than anything else.  Takeaway:  I recommend visiting if you want to grab a casual drink and share a few bar snacks with friends or coworkers in a nice downtown restaurant, or if you are willing to take a gamble on one of the more expensive meal options. Otherwise, I would suggest visiting elsewhere."}
{"text":"I visited with my mom on my birthday back in October, and it was absolutely the right choice. Our server was as friendly as could be and gave great suggestions for our meal. The cocktail she recommended to me- I think it was called a Georgia Peach?- was yummy, though it tasted much more like melon than peach. The Seared Pork Belly was totally decadent- buttery, full of umami flavor and perfectly crisp on the outside. Mom got the Faroe Islands Salmon, which was excellently cooked, though the lentils were a touch under-salted. We shared the Apple and Pear Crisp for dessert, which was delicious as well, but my entree really won the night.  I ordered the Roasted Mushroom and Poached Farm Egg. I'd originally planned on the Mac n Cheese, but our waitress persuaded me to give the egg dish a shot, and I am so incredibly happy I did. The egg was poached impeccably, and when the yolk broke over those grits, I nearly wept. Everything about it, from concept to execution, was excellent. The grits were rich and creamy, the mushrooms were delightfully earthy and tender, and whatever they did to that sauce was magical. I honestly feel a little depressed that I'll never get to eat it again. It keeps me up at night.  On second thought, maybe I should give them 1 star, because they ruined my life with their amazing food. Thanks a lot, guys."}
{"text":"I have a generally favorable view of this place. Like others before me have said, I definitely appreciate their fresh, simple approach that values quality ingredients and careful preparation.  Several things hold me back from a full-throated endorsement, however.  First, the prices are steep.  The one reasonably priced entree item- the burger- frequently runs out.  I'm not sure if I just hit this place at the wrong time over and over, but I've only ordered it successfully once.  They know the demand is there, so why not have more? I understand that they don't want to freeze it, or whatever, but I've hit that place at 7 o'clock, and they're out of hamburgers.  It becomes apparent pretty quickly why there's no rush to increase their supply- because every other entree costs 5 dollars more.   Secondly, the other (non-burger) entrees are small.  I rarely finish my plate at ANY restaurant, but here, it's no contest; I finish it all.  Last time, I ordered the mushroom risotto.  It was AMAZING.  I loved it!  But the size of it seemed like little more than a side dish.  My S.O. and I looked at each other at the end of the meal with our empty plates between us and I could tell we were thinking the same thing - I'm still so hungry!  Afterwards, we ended up going to Merry-Ann's around the corner for chili cheese fries (our adventure at that establishment is detailed in another review).  Finally, service is hit or miss.  Last time, my S.O. ordered the special.  The server said that she wasn't sure they still had the special, so he went ahead and ordered a back-up entree in case (this was his idea, not hers).  She never came back to tell us what result.  The runner came out with our food, and of course, it was not the special, but the backup.  She was busy, but it would have been nice if she had just swung by and told us that they were indeed out of the special.  I think she might have been new, because her server-patter was also wanting. (She really didn't know what to say to us when she first approached the table.)  She also forgot my Patio Pounder (a great cocktail, BTW) until I reminded her, and I only got it once I was almost done with my entree.  I had water, so it was no big deal, but the overall experience (coupled with the bill at the end) quashed the overall good vibe of the place.  Before I move, I do think I will go back and give it another shot.  Their date night menu looks like a good deal, and I'm really rooting for this place to be all it can be."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the whole experience! Our server (Kelly) was both knowledgeable and friendly. Menu was interesting and portion size was just right, allowing room for the deviled egg appitizer as well as dessert. The mac and cheese is killer as were the short ribs. My husband loved the rhubarb crisp and I thought the chocolate pot de creme' was amazing! Can't wait to go back as we saw sereval other menu offerings that also looked great!"}
{"text":"Updating to note that I have come to love the Big Grove even more over the past bunch of months. It's become one of our date-night regulars as their menus have started to incorporate many more veggie and fish options. I would recommend going at a less-busy time since they have been known to run out of things on, say, Saturday nights at 7.30, but it's all delicious. Totally enamored of their new brunch selection, too! Go. Here. Now."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better homegrown CU restaurants. A great, locally sourced, and seasonally rotating menu that has quite a bit of variety in terms of flavor as well as price. So if you're a cheapskate always looking to get the most for your money (like me =D) then you won't find Big Grove too bad. If you're also looking to empty your wallet they can accommodate that as well. The interior is hip, but not too hip, and I find the layout of the place pretty comfortable.The service here varies from day to day and depending on when you're dining, although I don't recall ever having a less than decent experience. Service staff is always very attentive and friendly and the food is always prepared well. They also have neat specials from time to time like half off house cocktails on Tuesdays! Overall a great place to go with a group or a date. Especially in the summer months when the patio is open!  P.S. One of my favorite places for brunch in the area. If you don't care for the dinner selections you should definitely try the place Sat/Sun morning."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times since they've opened and every time it has been a delicious evening. I went in January with a group of friends for my birthday and I can't say I remember exactly what I got but it was very good.  Went here more recently while my boyfriends parents were in town(and I was meeting them for the first time, yikes!) so a good meal was a must. We went on a Monday and did the date night menu which I have enjoyed before. My boyfriend got the grits with pickled vegetables and said they were amazing. I got the pate and I could have eaten that everyday and not gotten sick of it, so good. I got the risotto and he got the filet, both equally tasty. His parents said their meals were great too. There was also a nice beer selection to choose from. The only problem I've ever had there was one of their mixed drinks tasted very funny to me. Overall, the food outweighs that though."}
{"text":"I got the chicken sandwich with mixed greens. I felt like I was given a really small portion of chicken and the mixed greens that came with did not have a very exciting dressing or added flavor. The sandwich overall tasted fine, just wasn't very filling which for $10 makes me leave the table a bit unhappy. The popcorn that tastes like fruit loops was cool."}
{"text":"I came in here last Sunday with a small group of friends after hearing about the mimosa bar they have. The food was great! I had the chiliqulies. Our server Kathy, if I remember correctly,  was also great. Fun, attentive, and gave us the \"around the world\" mimosa treatment."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great service! Our server was very pleasant and more than happy to answer our questions about the food/menu (shout out to our server, Grant). The burgers are to die for! Also, very reasonably priced, especially for the quality and the fact that it is farm to table. I will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Great soft opening meal. The tatter tots, beets and Amish chicken were particular stars.  Can't wait until the full open."}
{"text":"Super locavore food. I was dining with locals who guided me towards the best stuff, but it all looked quite tasty. Venue was a bit noisy for 6pm on a weeknight, but enjoyable nonetheless."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!! Our waitress was extremely inconvenienced by us needing anything. We were there on a Sunday early afternoon. They weren't busy at all so it's not like she had other people to take care of. Her and the other employees were too busy talking with each other to have time to help any of the guests. When she would come over she wouldn't say more than 2 words to us and would leave as soon as possible. If we dared to ask her for anything she would just storm off and eventually come back with more water or popcorn since that is all we ever asked her to do. To top it all off, when we finished paying we were still talking and she came and got out receipt slips and read the tip amount! Of course she wasn't too happy since we tipped low based on how awful she was! But her doing that definitely justified to me why we tipped her low, that's for sure! Only reason I give 2 stars is because I liked the food. But it isn't worth going back to again if my friends and I will be treated poorly."}
{"text":"I came back to visit my hometown and was told Jim Gould's closed and was replaced by this place, and my friends said they really like the beer and food here. I am so happy that Champaign downtown has Big Grove Tavern! We sat at the bar for drinks and dinner. They had an excellent beer selection, with several Midwest and even some local brews and seasonal ones. The bartender was very helpful and attentive. The night we went, they had recently roasted an entire pig, so their specials were these amazing pork dishes. I enjoy pork quite a bit - beer and pork - since I've lived in Berlin and love German cuisine, so this place made me really happy. Based on my one visit, I'd recommend this place to all my friends and family, and anyone visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"Thanks to Big Grove we have a fine dining establishment that bases their menu on fresh and local ingredients.  I went there with my husband for our anniversary, but I can easily see going back for a more casual meal, or even for drinks and bar snacks.    Every table starts with slightly sweet popcorn and we were promptly visited by our friendly and helpful wait staff.  We had the chicken liver pate, bistro filet, house made sausage, and the tater tots.  Everything we tasted was delicious!  I can't wait to go back and work my way through the menu."}
{"text":"WOW.  What a great restaurant.  It is certainly on the pricier side, especially if you're a student.   However, I took my spouse on a date here, and we had a great time.  The entrees were great, the appetizer was really nice, and they even had classy, tasty flavored popcorn ( I believe it was fried rosemary?  Delicious!) for free at the tables.  They have a great beer menu, too."}
{"text":"This place has declined in quality significantly over the last few years. What used to be interesting, inspired farm-to-table cuisine with great cocktails has turned into run of the mill dishes, poorly prepared and plated, with service that leaves you scratching your head.  It's like they're trying to make it hard for you to enjoy yourself sometimes.  I was a regular when I first moved to Champaign, but as things declined, I went back less and less -- each time confirming that the place was going downhill."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary with Stout chaser is a must!  Delicious applewood smoked bacon and perfectly poached eggs."}
{"text":"We love Big Grove for their dedication to seasonal and locally sourced food. We love them for their simplicity in crafting delicious dishes. Example: the white beans and broccoli rabe with a sherry reduction--sublime. We love the atmosphere. It is a great addition to downtown Champaign. We hope they have a long and prosperous restaurant life."}
{"text":"Great food.  Friendly staff. Like\"Cheers\", with good food and the pleasure of not having to look at Shelley Long."}
{"text":"We were in town for the football game & looking for a quality place to grab a bite to eat. My wife loves organic & farm to table restaurants & this place did not disappoint. The decor is great & the menu looks like they change it often. The burger is one of the best burgers I have had in a while. The Mac-n-cheese is good, but I would not recommend it as your main course."}
{"text":"Ask for Tricia- courteous and professional waitress. She knows what she's doing and does it well!"}
{"text":"We went to Big Grove Tavern to celebrate a friend's birthday party on a busy weekend due to U of I graduation. The food was delicious, and the service was even better. They were even very accommodating for my picky friend and helped adjust their menu to fit his taste. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had our son's wedding rehearsal dinner here. I would NOT suggest this place for an event. The communication leading up to the event was very frustrating. I sent an email in July, stopped by the restaurant in Aug, and sent another email again in October before I ever got a response. If our son and his fiance didn't specifically request it, I would have gone somewhere else at that point.  I will say that the night of the event the service was excellent. They were attentive, caring, and had servant hearts. We were grateful for that.  I dropped off some decorations earlier in the afternoon and they decorated the room for us. I was also grateful for that. When we ran out of desserts (mini tarts) and I asked if they could make more, the chef was very accommodating and I was grateful.   The food left a lot to be desired. The mushroom risotto was virtually tasteless. The sweet potato mash left a lot to be desired. The chicken drumsticks were so small they looked more like the drummette from a chicken wing. This caused people to take more pieces than they normally would have, thus causing us to run out of chicken before everyone got through the line.   I would not recommend this place for an event. It added stress to a time that has enough stress of its own."}
{"text":"I gotta be honest... The Tavern burger is the best burger I've ever had in my entire life hands down. Props to the chef and this restaurant. Everything blended together perfectly... A medley of flavor so irresistible it has me drooling and wishing I could come back for more. You can trust me on this. I like food. A lot. But this burger changed my life. Buy the Tavern Burger. You won't regret it. One thing I would say: their definition of how well the meat is done is different than most, it is much less cooked than what a usual burger would be. Probably rule of thumb would be to order up from what you usually get if you don't like or are picky about how pink your meat is. i.e. If you're like me and like your burger \"medium rare\" order \"medium\" if you really don't like your meat any more pink than what you are used to.   I would highly recommend this restaurant to all people looking for an exceptional and creative meal."}
{"text":"This is really a 4.5 star rating!  Came for lunch and loved it!  The restaurant is beautiful, the service is fun,helpful, knowledgeable and attentive.  There is also a great outdoor seating area. The food was really great, especially the BLT.  There is an interesting and fairly extensive selection of beers.  My only complaint is that it is a limited lunch menu."}
{"text":"My wife and 2 co-workers had an excellent meal, after being referred here by hotel staff. She had a great filet, while other two had fish and pork chops. No one had dessert but I am told there are some interesting ice creams."}
{"text":"Would give it 1 star had it not been for actually receiving our food 50 mins after my group ordered.   A friend of mine asked where his order was when food was brought out and the waiter sarcastically said that he did not have three hands. I asked for a water and instead receieved a staredown from the same waiter and never received that water.  2-3 groups who arrived after my group received their food before ours. Did not get any check ups from our original waitress, she instead checked up on every other person besides us.   Food was mediocre and not worth an hour long wait. I suggest to take your business to any other restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"My coworker and I came for an early evening dinner. We both enjoyed the atmosphere and a few drinks. Extremely friendly service.   The popcorn that you start off with was tasty. I loved my blackberry rum infusion. For dinner, the roasted chicken was amazing. Would definitely return if in the area again."}
{"text":"Had a rehearsal dinner here for a wedding and was very pleased. Staff was very attentive and helpful. Had a great time!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really nice inside. It's a big open dimly lit space with candlelit tables. The restaurant itself has a pretty relaxing vibe as well. Their food is worth the price and they have a nice selection of local beers to compliment the delicious food. I tried the Triptych Empire of Dirt beer. It was very rich and malty with a hint of caramel chocolate and coffee. Because the beer was so flavorful, a 12 oz glass worked perfectly; it wasn't too much or too little. I ordered the Tavern Burger with the fried egg on top; the fried egg is optional, but I highly recommend it because it takes all the amazing flavors in the burger to a new level. They give everyone who comes in complimentary popcorn to start and it's actually pretty good. Me complimenting their popcorn actually means a lot seeing as I usually hate popcorn; working at a movie theater as a teenager pretty much ruined popcorn for me, but I am definitely a fan of theirs. This place works perfectly to bring a date or a small group of friends."}
{"text":"So disappointed! I understand it is Mother's Day and the restaurant would be busy but the service was horrible. We ordered a drink which came a little slow. We then ordered an appetizer that never came to the table. We sat there for 45 minutes and nothing! We paid for the drink and left. Honestly, they didn't even care. Never again"}
{"text":"I have had about 6 meals here, I live across the street so why not right. A couple Brunches, a couple chill lunches, and a few dinners. There is just always something. For the cost, (I understand that the locally sourced produce and meats are high quality and going to cost more) but for the cost... I just never feel that the meal hits the mark. No a quantity thing. I do love the servers, I dig the drinks, and the layout is pretty upscale/casual.  Go, enjoy. I\"m not being a hater. You will most likely have a great meal."}
{"text":"Recently, back in and one word! Katie! Our server was Excellent. Pleasant, confident, professional, friendly, and a joy to work with. Our Food and drinks came quickly and did not disappoint. Truly I would like to see more variety on the menu but love the farm fresh ingredients. Katie you rocked it!"}
{"text":"There is where my boyfriend takes me on valentine's day date night. The food is amazing and they even have a special catered menu for different holidays. The service makes it very enjoyable. Definietly a place to try out."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly people, and tasty food!  I'm new to Chambana and there are so many new food places to try.  I decided to make my way through the best rated establishments and try not to repeat any before finishing.  However, I think I'll have to break my rule for this place and head back soon.  Everything was very good but its the little things that stand out for me.  The deviled eggs were prepared to a different culinary level than I'd ever tasted before.  Unexpected and great!"}
{"text":"The true star here was our waitress!  She was unbelievably friendly and just the right amount of attentive.  We  had called ahead and learned that we could BYOB our own bottle of wine with a $15 corkage fee.  She saw the wine bottles right away and knew to offer to open them so they could breath.  (We were celebrating so they were really nice bottles.)  The appetizers for me were by far the best part of our meal here.  Our waitress suggested the biscuits and an asparagus dish.  We added a couple of deviled eggs.  They were all great.  My favorite was the egg.  They  do a different one all the time. The night we ate here the egg was \"picnic\" style.  Pretty much a traditional deviled egg placed on a very tasty smear of pickle relish.    My main course was a bone in rib eye steak.  It was not good.  There was no bone and I have never had a rib eye steak cut that thin in my life.  Because of the thinness, even though it was supposed to be cooked medium rare, it was well over done and tough.    We were all pretty full but decided to split one dessert six ways.  We had the chocolate bread pudding.  Be warned that it takes fifteen minutes to cook.  Even for just one bite it is worth it!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've yelped, but my most recent experience needs to be reported.  I'll just leave you with the facts:  - It took 15 minutes and asking the hostess to get anyone to attend to our table  - we only saw our waitress when ordering and dealing with the check. She didn't care at all   - Food was lukewarm, poorly seasoned, and overall mediocre  - I asked for jam, waited 30 minutes and left jam-less  If you're interested in poorly prepared food and even worst service, be my guest. But you'll never find me there again"}
{"text":"Hmm... Well...The menu seemed more casual than I expected.  The decor & bar area was simple elegance.   Tree branches & Italian lights.. Cloth napkins. .but, cheesy grits & popcorn ??!   We started out with those cheesy grits. They were not what I envisioned: they were deep fried squares with a green onions on top & a great dipping sauce on the plate . I was expecting a bowl of grits with cheese!! Lol Tracy was our server, &although she was friendly,   she was not informative as to what certain things were on the menu. .. I overheard a black server tell a table about sauces & recommend a wine selection. .. Next.. We had the highly recommended Tavern burger. We added the white cheddar. We both had them medium rare. ..my husband thought it was too rare, but I enjoyed it. We passed on the dessert... $5 for vanilla ice cream is a bit much..."}
{"text":"Great food.  The Spinach Salad with grapefruit and chicken is unreal.  I'm not even a huge salad fan generally and the chicken is ridiculously tender."}
{"text":"I went with my family there, it was my first time in the restaurant because I live in Miami, we were 12 people, the waitress was very unpleasant, rude, never smiled and everyone at the table felt mistreated by her, I do not understand how this kind of Business allow a person to attend the tables and be so unpleasant."}
{"text":"Our waitress was knowledgeable and attentive, 5 stars for her. The food quality, however was not good at all. We went for weekend brunch. I enjoyed the mimosa bar. Our waitress was very good at keeping our glasses full and offering all of the different flavors. I ordered the eggs benedict and it was extremely salty. The poached eggs were overcooked and the salad that came with it had way too much pepper for my taste. The hollandaise sauce was sub-par. Not worth $10. My friend had the French toast bread pudding. She liked it but it was too sweet for her so she couldn't finish it. The food is just too expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"I decided on Big Grove after driving around Champaign for a few minutes, and I wasn't disappointed.  It was a really nice day out, and since I parked in a nearby lot, I had to decide between here and Destihl. I looked at both menus, and frankly, because big grove was second, I stayed there. I opted to sit outside, in the sun. It was not bad at all.  Onto the  experience... first of all, my waitress was great and very attentive. Each table gets a little bowl of popcorn to start, which is cool.   Anyways, their menu is locally sourced, and quite small. They have a few appetizers, and I indulged in two of them. I had a deviled egg (dollar per), and I also ordered the pickled vegetables (radish, onion, fennel, and carrot). The deviled egg came with a rye crisp and sauteed red onions. It was okay, and I'm glad I only ordered one. On the other hand, the pickled vegetables were fantastic! A little pricey at 3 dollars, but definitely the highlight of my meal.  For my main course, I ordered the pork, bison, and beef burger. I had the aioli and red onion marmelade on the side. I like my burgers medium. I also ordered mine on whole grain bread instead of the standard bun.  The burger was average. It was not cooked medium well, and there was some yellow sauce (not the aioli, but possibly a mustard) that ended up on my burger, even though I asked for my burger plain.   My mixed greens salad with the vinagrette was good. My second favorite part, and I'm not a salad fan at all.  Overall, a decent place. Nothing special. My bill was 17 dollars, and I did not order a drink or anything. I like the feel of the restaurant, but honestly, I'll probably go somewhere else in the area before I head back here."}
{"text":"Lovely outdoor seating. Beautiful and delicious food. Only complaint was the time it took to get our food. It's not really a complaint though, because we knew our food was being freshly prepared."}
{"text":"I wish i could review the food, but after sitting for at least 10 minutes (we actually started a timer) no one had come to the table or made eye contact. Its not like they were busy, at least 3 servers were standing around at the bar chatting when we left. This behavior would not be acceptable at Denny's, let alone a place charging what this place does."}
{"text":"Came here for a special on chicken and waffles. First of all, amazing. Buttery waffles with garlic-marinated collard greens and free range chicken. We also started off with the chicken liver pate. Incredibly smooth and paired well with a side of seared pears atop freshly toasted, thick country bread. Did I mention the pickled onions? That sealed the deal.  Service here...incredible. From our host to our waiters, each staff member stepped out of their way to be easygoing and amicable. I had several lovely conversation about food with the knowledgeable people who work here.  Beautiful interior as well, quite chic with a rustic edge (look at those antler/ branch chandeliers). Wide open space with gorgeous, intimate lighting.  The only thing I wish I could change? The price. Alas, great portions with an equally robust price. The special, in particular, did not have a price listed. Be sure to come here for a celebration or special event, it's quite lovely."}
{"text":"We don't usually go to newly opened restaurants until they've been open for a month ... but so glad we went!  The food was delicious!  Service was amazing!  Ambiance delightful!.  Had a little of everything ... deviled egg, fries, chili with corn bread, mac and cheese - (mac and cheese is a little pricey) (sorry, but Boltinis mac and cheese has you beat on this one) -- and of course dessert .... rhubarb crunch and sweet potato waffles (the sea salted ice cream .. YUM!).  Of course, beer and a Glider before and during dinner.  Great job!  We will definitely be back and feel that this will go on our favorites list.  Another great downtown Champaign restaurant/bar!"}
{"text":"Food isn't fresh, tastes warmed over.  With all the other choices downtown, don't bother."}
{"text":"Wow. This place feels very hip ;) Compared to the conservative drab feeling of Jim Gould they did an INCREDIBLE job of the remodel. You HAVE to try every single appetizer, they're all winners. Me=impressed."}
{"text":"The food here is terrible; especially if you're looking at vegetarian options.   The mushroom farro was tasteless. I realize that farros are supposed to be relatively healthy and not the most flavorful items; but the mushroom farro here can be described as bland at the very best. It was served half-cold and dry-ish like someone just heated by a frozen pack without caring to garnish it with even the slightest bit of flavor or hardwork.   The fingerling potato salad came with a honey mustard dressing, which is okay. But who in the world would pair already bitter rhubarb with a mustard sauce to create one of the most horrible tastes one can experience. The chef at big grove, of course.   This was a waste of time and money and I'm never going here again."}
{"text":"So fun and trendy and industrial inside this place! I knew the second I walked in that I would like this place. Definitely my scene.  Started with their fried brussels sprouts (also a trendy food item on top of the trendy decor! theme??) with tuffle aioli and sea salt and nothing like a little sea salt to push a dish over! These things were addicting. I shared a little, but not much! Gotta love some good brussel sprouts. I still don't get why kids hate these things so much???  Then since I ate vegetables to start like a good kid (I know, yes they were fried, but come on, let me have my cake and it too, okay?), I thought that granted me the ability to get their mac and cheese in a little oven baked dish packed with tons of cheese, bacon, leeks, fried shallots, and then as it should be, topped with crumbled bread crumbs! Mmmmmm that mac and cheese was exactly how I like my mac and cheese! Hot, creamy, cheesy, goodness. Done and done.   Plus they had a good beer selection here too, the only thing I think that was missing was more attentive service since I would have ordered more beer if they had come around more quickly and the water service, but pretty minor! I definitely would come back here if I visited again!"}
{"text":"Went there for a Saturday brunch. Ordered the special huevos rancheros, black bean burger, and eggs Benedict. The best part of this experience was the coffee and service! The poached eggs was over cooked and hollandaise sauce taste different but had no lemon. The avocado on the black bean burger made the burger tasty. One plate was a special order and was sent back two times. The cook was having an off day. Left unsatisfied with the food but the manager did own up to their mistake. Just for the future Yelpers, for the price you pay for local farm to table restaurant not everything on the menu is done with precision."}
{"text":"Probably the best place to eat in town now.  A quasi-Portland style menu with some unexpected combinations.  Cocktail prices are the bomb.  Cocktails are not large but I'm not complaining. Very good deviled egg."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointing.  The atmosphere and decor are wonderful and the menu is spectacular.  Unfortunately they fail at execution.  The first night I dined was around 9pm and there were no other customers inside, a few tables lingered in the very nice outdoor patio dining area but no one else inside.  The bartender was friendly but mostly concerned with closing up rather than serving a single diner at the bar.  I ordered the ribeye and it was overcooked.  It took several minutes before I could get the bartenders attention to tell her the steak had been overcooked but she immediately returned the steak and had the kitchen cook another.  She happily brought me popcorn while I waited.  The second steak was under cooked but I'm ok with rare so I didn't complain.  In most places the manager would have come to speak to a guest who experienced an issue but not this time. The following night my company took 26 of us out to dinner at BGT.  This was planned weeks in advance however, BGT only had a single server assigned to our group.  It took forever for him to take the order and get it into the system.  Glassware piled up on the tables and beverage orders were super slow.  When the food finally came out, more than half the orders were overcooked (burgers, shrimp, steak, salmon).  I'd have to say the grill guy must be very inexperienced to have overcooked so many dishes.  Usually, with parties this large a manager will greet the guests and at least check on them.  However, again, no manager in sight.   BGT is a beautiful restaurant and the menu really is very nice.  However, service and food quality sadly fail.  I could not recommend this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the rudest service I have ever received in my life. I've eaten here several times before with work associates and out-of-town guests and never had any problems. So it makes me wonder when I show up with my 20 year old bi-racial daughter and her brown friends that I have problems. When my daughter asked about the delicious cornbread appetizer she and I enjoyed on the patio last fall, Cat, our server, rudely informed her that they've never had cornbread and she should know because she has been working there since March. Then she walked away without taking any orders. It didn't stop there. We had to ask for straws for our water, refills for our water when we were all clearly out, she spilled water on one of my daughter's friend's lap and smirked and said a half-hearted \"sorry\", and then later flipped the final check on the table with a hasty \"thanks\" without even stopping at the table. I guess spending $140 on a meal for 4 doesn't warrant any courtesy."}
{"text":"I have been to Big Grove about 5 times over the last 2 years and have always been very happy with my experience. However tonight was a less than happy experience. After being seated the waitress came within 5 minutes and took our drinks.. 2 lemonades and a Moscow Mule..lemonades came quickly..20+ minutes for the Mule. 20+ minutes later our order was taken...over 40 minutes later we received our food. I was accompanied by my son and 3 year old granddaughter celebrating her birthday.  Items ordered were the flank steak, mac and cheese and kids menu (only 2 items to choose from) chicken tenders.  The food was good but not great. We also ordered ice cream for my granddaughter's birthday and a sweet potato cake that was dry and had a weird after taste.  Our bill came to $80 FRICKN dollars!!! Way way over priced!! This reminds me of Jim Goulds that went out of business for this reason!! I agree with previous reviews that they are trying too much to be different and have Chicago or New York prices.  In conclusion, we were there for over 90 minutes (with a 3 year old), food was good but not great and extremely over priced..will not return as there are many better options in Champaign-Urbana."}
{"text":"After a less than stellar experience at Desthil we walked across the street to Big Grove Tavern. The place was great, some loud people next to us but nothing we couldn't live with. Food and service were amazing. I wished we had started our evening there. My son and I shared a 4 course meal. His salad was yummy. My soup was ok but the salmon made up for it. My son had the pork shoulder very tender and flavorful. Even their ginger ale had a different and unique taste. My daughter had the tavern burger -mmmm she loved it! We all enjoyed the chili fries. The dessert was an apple crisp. I enjoyed it but was pretty sure I ordered a different dessert because no one in my family likes apples. However, since everyone was pretty full we opted for keeping the erroneous yet delicious sweet. I cannot emphasize enough they have amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"We decided to give this a try on Valentine's Day...and overall I would say it was very enjoyable.  This is the third time I've eaten here, so I feel qualified at this point to pass judgement. My impressions so far:  The food is great...although the dinner portions tend to weigh in on the \"smaller\" side.  I had the filet, and what it lacked in size it made up for in taste. It was well cooked and tasted excellent. However, the side that came with it (a mixture of small carrots and potatoes) left something to be desired. This isn't a place you'll go for dinner and take home any leftovers.  The Risotto also tasted great, and while it also wasn't a huge portion, it seemed to be enough to suffice.  The prices were also fairly reasonable for a medium-to-upper scale restaurant, except for the $8 cocktail which seemed on the skimpy side, size-wise.  Two other standouts at this place for me are the deviled eggs appetizers ($1 a piece, and delicious!) and the Tavern Burger, which is a mixture of beef, pork, and bison and is the reason I will keep going back.  For my money, it's one of the best burgers in town."}
{"text":"Leah is absolutely amazing. I came here with a group of 7 for brunch and she took amazing care of us. Food was good, but her service really took it to a new level for us. So courteous and helpful and always made sure our drinks were topped off. I'll be back just to be seated in her section!"}
{"text":"I tried Big Grove based on recommendation and the menu looked different and local. The outdoor patio is really cute and well decorated. Really enjoyed sitting there in the good weather! Our waitress let us taste a few wines before we picked a bottle, but other than that, she was pretty unpleasant.   I got the succotash, which was nicely presented and the flavors were great. It was a pretty small dish, but I was warned. My friend got the chicken which was also really well put together and tasted great.   While we were there, a Spanish mariachi band stopped by and played and that also really added to the fun atmosphere. The place was not overcrowded so it was really enjoyable to sit there for a while. The reason for the 4 stars is just based on the waitress we had, but the food was good and I would eat there again."}
{"text":"The food here is always fresh. Seasonal menus are great. I wish there were more vegetable options, but the brussels sprouts are amazing. Drinks are good and the desserts are really nice. All in all, a wonderful place to eat out in Champaign."}
{"text":"Terrible. From the service to the food. Our server \"Grant\" was extremely unattentive and the food was not fresh. The ribeye was one of the worst cuts of meat I've ever tasted, came out ice cold, and was served with a side of what can only be described as a pile of yuck. Drink orders were messed up, took 20 mins to get fixed, and we never once had a manager visit the table. We will not be returning and am advising everyone I know to avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"I've been here a four times.  I want to love this place, but can't quite get there.  Pros:  *Drinks- very good.  We had a watered down old fashioned once, but other than that one experiences, the drinks have been interesting and tasty. *Good, friendly service.  Sometimes it is a little slow, but servers are always friendly and do their best for you.  The So-So:  *menu tends towards fancified home cooking, which is not a bad thing.  But given that, it seems a bit overpriced for what you get.  The food we've had as been consistently okay, but not amazing.  Dinner?  Okay.  Brunch (which I really, really wanted to love)?  Again, just okay.  If you don't cook a lot at home, this can be a great place for you.  If you are a successful and inventive home cook, you might not be as impressed.    Con: **This is the thing that makes me not want to give Big Grove another chance.  We were in about 6 months ago (August), and both ordered the burger.  We requested some tomato to go with it, and the waitress came back- somewhat sheepishly, to her credit- and told us that the kitchen didn't serve it with tomato.  Okay.  I've been to fine dining restaurants, and I understand that chefs conceptualize the flavors of a dish in a particular way, and that's the way they want you to experience it.  But a burger?  And, more importantly, this burger?  It's fine, but it's not all that.  Perhaps they were just out of tomatoes?  But anyway, the fact that they were so proud of this burger keeps gnawing at me.    Overall: *Good drinks, fine ambience, good service.  In the greater scheme of things, they are still fairly new, so maybe they'll continue to evolve?  I hope so, because I'd love to see them reach a little bit higher; there seems to be potential for more here."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere, friendly staff. Love the rotating menu- always something new to try. Check the hours before going, they are not open everyday."}
{"text":"I went their for a weekend lunch and was disappointed in the selections available.  For lunch entrees, there were only sandwiches, and I was really trying to avoid bread.  I got a turkey one anyway, and the amount of bread was huge!  The amount of turkey was small.  They served a huge amount of sweet potato chips with it.  The sandwich was good, but not worth it's $11 price tag.  The service was really slow- we waited 20 minutes for a check, and finally had to ask the host for help.  The best thing about the lunch was the mini-popcorn appetizer."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. There were only a few tables occupied and a large table near the back. The popcorn of the day was smoked paprika. Yum! We ordered a beer and the liquid sunshine cocktail. The cocktail was refreshing. I don't usually feel like cocktails refresh me, but this one did. We ordered the zucchini banana bread and shared that as like an appetizer. It was soft and not too sweet. Then, my boyfriend ordered the chilequiles and I ordered the fried egg BLT with sweet potato chips. The chilequiles has a little mild kick to it and it's pretty good. I loved my fried egg BLT! The egg was cooked over medium and so when I cut into the sandwich it oozed some yolk out onto the plate, but not so much that it was hard to eat. The bacon was thick cut and the tomato was sweet, but not overly ripe. The aioli was good and I probably should have asked for just a little more of it on the side. ;) Sweet potato chips were super thin with some salt and yummy.  We would eat here again."}
{"text":"I was glad to see something young and fresh in place of Jim Gould. Gould was boring and dated, but the only option we had in the C-U if you wanted to go to a \"nice\" restaurant. Big Grove Tavern has a casual updated atmosphere with an original concept for the C-U (farm to table).  We wanted to go to Destihl (right across from Big Grove) yesterday for lunch,  but there was a wait and we couldn't wait. We finally had a chance to try Big Grove.  There was no wait, and we were seated right away. We were with our 2.5 year old, and  we have never gone to a kid restaurant. Our daughter is used to dining in grown up restaurants with grown ups, but even the most patient of young foodies could use a quiet distraction while they wait.  Destihl is not a kids' restaurant, but they have a variety of foods to choose from on the kids' menu and they give the kids crayons to color on the kids' menu. Smart and simple concept that works well.   The server at Big Grove said they do not have a kids' menu, but they have \"kid friendly\" options. All they had was grilled cheese and sweet potato fries. I asked if we could just get regular potato fries and the server said \"yes\" so that is what my daughter got. I never understood the whole trend of replacing delicious french fries with sweet potato fries--they don't taste better nor are they \"healthier\" or much lower in calories. If you are going to eat fries make them from potatoes not sweet potatoes.   I wanted to order a burger, but all their burger options are a blend of beef, bison and pork and I don't want to eat bison so I ordered the Black Bean Burger.  My husband ordered \"The Baltimore\"which is basically a BLT with avocados.   My daughter's fries had more salt than there is in salt. Maybe it was just that day, but someone went really heavy handed with the salt.  My Black Bean Burger was really good. It's not what I wanted to eat, but if you are vegetarian (I have been on and off for years) this was delicious.  My husband's order was okay. It's a BLT with avocado. Why take a classic and add something that adds nothing?  The server was great--very nice person and efficient.  The design and layout of the restaurant is great. Casual and open. Trying to be a gastropub, but misses the mark with the menu. It's still a big step up for the C-U in terms of dining options.   I liked this place. I like the concept, the layout, the service, but the menu is not for me. The food is not bad, but not great. Too many options like a classic burger or BLT are turned into things that are trying too hard to be \"cheffie\", but miss the mark. I just wish they didn't try to reinvent the wheel on these American food classics. If they're going to reinvent the classics they better make them better than the original. I would have liked to see a few classics taken up a notch with a gourmet twist or just a few classics done really well.  Overall Big Grove is worth a try, but I wouldn't highly recommend it or anything because the food options are limited and the food tastes okay. Not great, just okay."}
{"text":"I've loved Big Grove since they opened, but am a HUGE fan of their new(ish) brunch and bar snack menus. Their food is fresh and usually extremely good. I feel like their chef could really go \"all out\" on some creative dishes, but may feel the need to dial it back for the traditional midwestern palette. As such, I'm giving 4 out of 5 stars, because for the farm-to-table it is good, but could be even better if the chef showed her true talents!"}
{"text":"Two of us randomly decided to try Big Grove Tavern after having some beers at nearby Quality Beer. I was pleasantly surprised how great the whole experience was.  On Monday night they had a nice pre fixe menu for $50 with shared appetizer, soup/salad, entree, and shared dessert. Otherwise I could see dinner getting pricey here fast.   We started with the Brussels sprouts which were lightly fried and not as oily as most fried sprouts. I could eat these all day.  We tried a couple of deviled eggs and they fact that you can order them one apiece for $1 is nice if you just want a taste. Pretty standard, but tasty as most deviled eggs (to me) usually are.   The cauliflower soup was nice as well. A bit plainer tasting than butternut squash soup, but I would still order it again with some toasted almonds.   The steak entree was cooked perfectly though they never asked how I wanted it cooked. Glad they read my mind and got the medium rare cook correct. Root veggies were good too.  I wasn't in love with the rice pudding, though it's not usually my thing. I didn't think it actually had rice in it...  Though I don't get to Champaign too often, I would easily recommend it for someone looking for a good farm to table restaurant. Especially Mondays!"}
{"text":"16 bucks for a BLT sandwich? 2.50 cents extra for some fries instead of chips? this place wasn't even good and a rip off.  And those little popcorn things are stupid. PUKE"}
{"text":"If it weren't for the customer service, this would be a 1 star. Even the manager (super nice) came out to talk to us after what we experienced.  The customer service was fantastic, but unfortunately you can't run a restaurant on customer service alone.  I went there for the ramen night with low expectations, and they somehow managed to destroy my expectations in the worst way possible.  I ordered the appetizer which was extremely salty. When I asked the waitress regarding it she took it back no questions asked. Strike 1. edit: (the appetizer was fried brussel sprouts)  The ramen came out, I had no expectations whatsoever of it being any good but the waitress had talked it up, talking about how the noodles were made in house and how the chef had studied in Japan for 10 years. The menu stated the broth would be rich and with many other components. What actually was in my bow was a wet soppy mess that no one should need to finish. Firstly, the most important component of every ramen bowl is the broth. The broth was brown water, it tasted nothing like how broth should taste. There was not a single flavor in that broth that I could discern. The \"crispy pork belly\" noted on the menu was actually thin cut like bacon, which would have been fine, if it had any sort of edible texture. The pork was harder than jerky. The egg looked great, but upon biting it, you realize the salt they had forgot to use for the ramen must have been accidentally dumped into the egg. That must be why they ran out. Every component in the bowl was either too salty or flavorless or unchewable. The one single thing that was acceptable in the bowl was the kale. Thanks for the kale. Strike 2.  This was when I had to ask them to take it back. To clarify I only took a single taste of each component so it's not like I consumed half of the dish before asking the waitress. This was when the manager came out to talk to us and discussed the dish with us which I really appreciated.  They took both the ramen and the appetizer off our bill and I wanted to leave but they provided a personal recommendation for me to stay. So I took it, and to be clear, this was one of the manager's 3 personal recommendations.  Every component of the dish was either too bland or too salty, but at that point, on the third dish what can anyone say? It's as if they dumped the entire dish's worth of salt on the chicken and ran out half way through. Strike 3. I ended up just paying for it and tipping the waitress extra for her troubles.  As nice as customer service was, unfortunately I can't recommend this place to anyone unless you're just going for drinks. I am certainly not returning as much as I want to.  Also, if you get bad food, be nice to the waiter/waitress because it's not their fault.  :( :( :("}
{"text":"I've been here twice for dinner and both times the food was amazing.  I recently moved here from the restaurant mecca of Atlanta and this place holds up well against some of my Atlanta favorites.  Their food is fresh and tasty, and the atmosphere pleasant and vibrant but not too loud.  I'll definitely be going back again and again."}
{"text":"I love this place and always make an effort to pay a visit while I'm in Champaign. it's a surprise to me that there aren't more farm-to-table places in the area, and I really like Big Grove Taven's concept. is it executed flawlessly? Not entirely (I can't help but compare it to similar places in NYC, and think the flavor and complexity of the dishes could be deeper) but it's still pretty great. I've had excellent service on both my visits. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Food was good, nice downtown Champaign location, nice outdoor dining space.  Our server seemed to not care, not very conversational.  A little pricey, interesting menu, good selection of beer and wine.  Nice bar, service was a little slow."}
{"text":"Great new option in downtown Champaign.  Everything about this place has a light touch--both casual and selective.  The welcome snack is a daily-fresh made popcorn with a rotating seasoning.  Ours was crazy good, but we had to ask the server to place the flavor:  cumin & orange zest!  Apparently the chef regularly changes it.  The tap and bottle list is craft beer lover's friend. Not trying to outdo a number-of-taps contest, but all the right choices were there. Especially loved the slightly sarcastic \"These Beers?\" bottom of section of the menu for those who want a Bud Light instead.  Tater tots are like nothing you've seen: homemade and tasty with an apple sauce. The smoked bacon practically jumped off the deviled eggs.  The menu feels relatively small when you're used to the pages and pages on your typical chain.  And I wouldn't mind if they expanded it a bit, but there were so many good looking items, I think it will take several visits without any boredom. That most of the ingredients are locally bought makes it worth it.  Service was exactly what you expect from a place like this: a whole step above any chain restaurant. Constant attention, knowledgeable about the food, funny and warm, but never over-intrusive. Perfect!  Nice job, Big Grove Tavern.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"So a friend told me to vote 6 stars for this place, and I wish I could! After a Sunday morning derby match we were invited by our opponents to go here for a brunch.  This must be a hot Sunday Funday spot as it was packed when we got there.  We were lucky there were some open seats at the bar.  We loved this place because Sundays they have $8 bottomless mimosas.  When you have about 10 derby girls from Wisconsin you'll find out there is a bottom to bottomless mimosas.  We had great service as the bartender was very helpful and was on top of everything...especially when those mimosa glasses were empty.  I ordered a chili scramble which I liked because it did have a kick to it but wasn't too spicy.  I wish the portion size was a little bigger but I was feeling pretty full with the potatoes and toast that came with it.  They also have THE BEST DEVILED EGGS EVER!  Each egg had a little bacon strip poking from the top of the egg and the egg was on top of some mushroom sauce.  It was so soft and fluffy that it was pretty tempting to get more since they only cost $1 each.  If I come back to this town again, I have to come back here for any meal."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a friend and we sat outside in the nice weather, so I can't discuss the interior.   Overall the food is ok, but I don't think that it's worth the price. I had a simple cheeseburger and fries, with a lemonade. Server was very pleasant, food was prepared as I had requested and very tasty: but almost $20 is too much to pay for a burger and fries no know the beef is superior and I know that the location is great, but I feel as if part of the cost was due to location. The burger wasn't $20 good. It was fine but nothing over the top special.   Next time I'll try something a little more elaborate and try inside."}
{"text":"Good local source food and good menu.  We popped in on a Friday night and sat in the bar area.  Devil eggs and chicken liver pate was rich and delicious.  Burger and mushroom farro for entrees and then moved on to the apple crisp for dessert.  The food will not knock your socks off, but sometimes you just need a easy going chill place to eat some good food.  Nice spacious restaurant vibe with good service too!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I will be moving to the Champaign area in August, so we decided to house hunt over memorial day weekend.  Of course while we were in town we couldn't help but to check out what the town had for Sunday Brunch options.  We settled on Big Grove Tavern because my fellow yelp eliters have recommended this place for the bottomless mimosas and I definitely not one to pass up a boozy brunch!  Atmosphere:  Very trendy!  It was a beautiful day outside and I was so happy they had outdoor seating.  Inside was equally impressive, it had a full bar and you could tell that at nighttime this place would turn into a great date night spot.  Service: Our waitress was fantastic, her name was Trisha I believe.  She was very attentive, gave us suggestions on the menu, and the best part she kept our mimosa's full!  In addition, after she found out that we would be moving into the area, she gave us tips on location and housing.  She was very friendly and on point.  Food: Unfortunately, this is where the Big Grove is lacking. I ordered pancakes, eggs, breakfast potatoes, and bacon.  My husband ordered the mac and cheese.  The portion sizes were great, however, the flavor is just missing.  The pancakes tasted of out of the box quality, there was just nothing special about them. Usually, if pancakes are lacking at an establishment, the house made syrup can make up for the lack of flavor, however, the syrup lacked flavor as well :/  The breakfast potatoes lacked flavor as well, no special seasoning, salt, or pepper.  It seemed as if the were just cut up and fried :/  The breakfast was very disappointing.  Hubby had the same comments about the mac and cheese-lacked flavor.  He said dish overall was very bland and the cheese and noodles did not blend very well; it was dry. I sampled his dish as well and I totally agreed with his comments.    Drinks:  The mimosa's were the highlight of the brunch, they had 5 different flavors to choose from; watermelon, orange, mango, peach, strawberry!  You could also mix and match.  They were so good! Not at all watered down with the juices.  Overall the experience was just OK and we wouldn't return at this time for brunch due to the food being subpar. The atmosphere, service, and mimosa's are on point, however, the food needs a huge turnaround."}
{"text":"Extremely pleased with the service and  the manager Daniel that was on staff when we ate here. The weekend brunch menu with option of the bottomless mimosas was a great way to spend a Saturday morning. Even after receiving a dish that was too salty, the staff was very helpful in fixing the problem and offering an option to remedy the situation. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Big Grove is a truly great restaurant, and I can see why it's so popular. This place is embodies what it means to be a farm to table restaurant, and coupling that with a great atmosphere, I'll definitely keep coming back.  I've been here a few times now for brunch and dinner and I've yet to have a negative experience. I particularly enjoyed their brunch, having food and drinks in their outdoor seating area. They have a special brunch menu and offer a mimosa bar and probably the best Bloody Mary in town with the Bourbon Bacon Bloody Mary.  Their menu is full of unique dishes with local flavor and incorporates the usual staple menu items with their own special twist. I've enjoyed their steak, burger, chilaquiles, and their grilled shrimp and grits. Each dish was uniquely amazing and opened me up to flavor combinations I've never experienced before.  Bottom line, Big Grove is a must go when you're in the C-U area. No matter what occasion or time of day, the dining experience will be among the best in the area. A highly recommended establishment."}
{"text":"The worst service I ever had called to speak to manager never returned calls took family for breakfast waitress rolled eyes food plates burned kids hands breakfast was disappointing heard yelling from the kitchen the entire time I understand a bad day but not retuning calls to deal with the issue is unacceptable"}
{"text":"I wouldn't call it a Tavern... I'd put it more in the upscale gastropub category.  Tavern implies dark, cozy, slightly antiqued.  Big Grove is open, airy and modern.  The food was good but not phenomenal, but the drinks were great -- and thoughtfully recommended by our waitress, who was nothing short of fantastic.  Seriously.  I so often wish I'd kept track of servers' names, but this one I seriously regret because she deserves a wonderful review directly to her manager.  I'm sure I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere. Amazing food. Had the fried brussell sprouts and steak frites. Really great service as well!!"}
{"text":"The service was great. The food and atmosphere I did not care for. I thought their famous deviled eggs were not good at all."}
{"text":"It's been over a year since my first review. Given its popularity, I decided to give this place another chance. Since that initial visit, I have now tried their chicken and dumplings and the skirt steak. The chicken was lovely, moist and well seasoned, the dumplings, however, were a bit of a downer--they were SALTY, small, and sparse, nothing exciting. I might try the dish again, but will have to ask them to be mindful of their salt. The skirt steak was cooked as requested (medium) and was surprisingly tender. I think that they change the accompanying veggies seasonally, but it's always served with a chimichurri (sauce). Given that chimi is one of my favorite sauces, I'll admit that I was skeptical of trying it in Champaign, and was pleasantly surprised--the downfall, they serve it as decorative dots on the plate, rather than a sauce for the meat so there's hardly any of it to enjoy! As you can see, my review of the food has much improved since my first post. I still think that it is overpriced for the portions and location (come on it's Champaign!). My last waitress was pretty good--so service also seems to have improved (or I might've just been lucky)."}
{"text":"My husband and I went out for dinner in downtown Champaign and decided to try Big Grove Tavern.  This was only the second time I had been there, but the first experience wasn't memorable so we decided to try it again.  I will say the service was excellent throughout our meal and is what pushed my rating from two stars to three.  We started with a small portion of popcorn at our table.  I do not recall what it was flavored with, but I didn't care for it.  After looking over the menu, I ordered the duck confit curry and my husband ordered a steak with cheesy grits as well as three deviled eggs as an appetizer.  Then we both had water to drink.  The waitress did a wonderful job keeping our water glasses full.  The eggs came out first and we were excited to see the crisp and red dollop on top.  Unfortunately it was not a delicious cheese crisp or anything so tasty, it was simply crispy bread that was rather flavorless.  The egg itself was fine and the presentation was pretty, but I wasn't wowed or impressed with the taste as I can make these at home.  I would not order them again.  When our meal came out everything looked fantastic.  When I started my dish, the curry was spicy and flavorful with surprisingly tasty brussel sprouts mixed into the veggies.  It was the highlight of the night by far.  I also stole a couple bites of the cheesy grits and they were good as well.  What wasn't the best was the fantastic looking steak was not cooked properly.  It came out quite rare even though he had ordered it cooked to medium temperature and while he ate it and did not complain, it was far too red for me and I did not try it.  I did take a bite of his squash vegetables mixture and it was steamed but again lacked flavor.  All in all it was a pleasant night out in a nice restaurant with a cool decor, but unless invited by friends I don't know that I would go back."}
{"text":"I have never been to the MIdwest--except 3 days in Chicago in heat and humidity so intense I remember almost nothing--but can say without question that this restaurant would be a hit even in NYC or LA.   I ate here twice on a visit, once for lunch and once for dinner, and was initially struck by the sheer beauty--and size--of the restaurant. It gets crazy busy on a Friday night and appears to be the only upscale bar in the area.  Recommended dishes:  1) Veggie mac and cheese  2) Chili: cup or bowl, cornbread on the side  3) Lake Trout (I don't even like trout--it's my least favorite fish, likely because I have only had river trout with the bones and almonds and butter, but this was sublime with horseradish sauce)  4) Pate which rivals the best I've eaten and is my personal favorite because it's mousse-like and light and not too heavy/strong but still exquisitely flavorful: it's better than the chicken livers at the Public Kitchen at Hollywood and served almost identically at a far lower price  5) Fried grits--I know, this doesn't sound good at all but it has a chipotle aioli and for a decadent fried treat, you can't do better. I didn't know much about grits, as an LA girl, but apparently you can cook them without much fat and then unceremoniously dump a big hunk of butter on top so that it's like cream of wheat with butter, or you can do it more like the French with butter and cream, in which case it's far worse for you but tastes infinitely better. Executive chef Jessica Gorin subscribes to the second school of grit preparation and I wholly approve.   5) Beets: they were as good as the Purple Pig in Chicago but this is a \"bar bite\" (see below) so if you want a large portion, order two.   6) Chocolate bread pudding: this dessert rivals the Olio e Limone chocolate bread pudding with bananas which Julia Child cited as among her favorite desserts in Santa Barbara  7) Pork belly: this has become trendy of late and some restaurants are pulling it from menus in big cities as people seem to be over it to some extent but Big Grove Tavern hits it out of the park with this appetizer.   8) Burger: some people in the area carped about the price of the burger here, not realizing that this is standard in LA and NYC (actually, their burger is cheaper than most fine dining burgers in cities I travel or live) and it's sheer perfection with the onions and cheese.   The prices are reasonable and they offer a sort of mini-appetizer they call a \"bar bite,\" for 3 to 5 dollars. This is a nice option as you can try all sorts of sides for not a lot of money.   The watercress soup was beautiful and subtle but the only dish on the menu that didn't send me into another galaxy.   I truly believe Big Grove Tavern would be a hit in a city. In Champaign, which is a college town that feels infinitely smaller than it really is, with very few fine dining options, I see why the place is booming and if I lived in this tiny place, I'd eat here three times a week."}
{"text":"Pretty good, local food. Make sure to try the olive oil and sea salt ice cream!"}
{"text":"Warm popcorn in galvanized micro-buckets greeted us with a wonderful crunch and delightful nibble while our beers arrived, the deviled eggs were a true highlight.  Service was wonderful, and there was an understated elegance and relaxation in the staff and the atmosphere.  Tiny smelt breaded and fried with lemon mayo were a hit; the wonderfully seasoned pork-belly with grits melted like chocolate as it entered my mouth.    However, the special pork shank and beans seemed a bit of a miss, and the mac and cheese, although quite tasty, was so large and rich and hot that it was difficult to enjoy-maybe it could be a small appetizer, side?    The chef at Big Grove definitely puts out quality, tasty food that re-imagines the standard Midwestern menu.  I applaud that. However, some of the details were slightly troubling: out of draw item (burger) at 7:00 PM; slight gaffe on menu 'These beers?'; one dish that didn't quite work.  3.5"}
{"text":"My wife and I arrived for dinner shortly before six pm on a Saturday and were contemplating sitting inside or out.  We were advised that if we didn't have a reservation we would be sitting outside or at the bar due to a 45 minute wait.  Note that at the time we arrived 80% of the tables inside were empty - no problem, we enjoy sitting outdoors.  Side note: forty-five minutes later there are still twelve empty tables inside...  We enjoyed the cumin flavored popcorn and ordered a wedge salad to share.  The wedge salad needs a little help (extra crumbles please) but the bacon had a distinct full smokey flavor and was very good.  We requested salt and pepper and they brought it out in little stainless dishes.    My wife ordered the scallops and I ordered the flank steak.  The scallops (four) were exceptionally good - flavorful and delicious.  The cornbread was just ok.  The flank steak was marginal but ok - served with delicious sides.    The wine and beer list is solid - lots of good choices.  Good table service - steak could have been brought out hot off the grill but can't have it all.  My wife was unimpressed overall - note the menu prices are high.   The atmosphere is upscale overall and the food presentation is excellent.  The menu options are limited.  The music is questionably appropriate for dinner but not offensive."}
{"text":"Great food, great ingredients, great service, and the prices are perfect.  Was in town for business, pleasantly surprised at the choices.  This was so good, ate here twice. The chili is phenomenal and the free-range roasted chicken, with green beans, fingerling potatoes and the outstanding herb dumplings...awesome The BEST cornbread EVER"}
{"text":"Solo female went on a Sunday morning around 1130 am.  Checked in and the hottest said it's so busy that she doesn't think she can seat me anywhere but the bar. I ask how much of a wait till outside opens. She says 20 min. I put my name in and decide to wait outside on a bench.  Mind you, when I walked up to the restaurant, SEVERAL open tables were open outside. But, I've worked in restaurants before and know that it's either reserved or not open due to lack of adequate staffing.   Waited 20 min. Then 25. Finally go back into the foyer area. Hostess sees me and it was like she just remembered I was waiting. Goes outside to look at the open tables and then comes back inside to come get me. Get sat down. Got a water and popcorn very fast.  Waitress comes by, takes my order...i can't remember the name but it was a vegetarian scramble dish.   Get my food. I had finished my water and kept hoping someone would come by to fill it up. Nope. Was never asked by the waitress if my food was ok or if I needed anything....she dropped the food off and then 15 minutes later, dropped my check off. When she dropped the check off, I hadn't had water for about 20 min at that point....i ask her for another glass. She takes my payment and comes back, fills water glass and walks away.  From other reviews, it seems this place needs a  overhaul of staffing and better training. I saw people walking by with water pitchers filling other people's water but never once glancing at someone else's table to see if they need water. There is no teamwork. I barely saw my waitress 3 times and she said a total of 10 words to me.   Food was ok. Beans and sour cream were the only things bringing the dish flavor."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, and every time have left satisfied.  My favorite was the brunch!  Their beer, wine and mixed drink selections are great!  Overall the atmosphere inside and menu are great.  A little more than I'd like to spend on a dinner, but it's nice for a special occasion.  I would recommend the burger or anything on the brunch menu!  Their menu changes with the season which is great!"}
{"text":"If it were only based off of food, I would give this restaurant 3 stars! I went here for brunch recently and ordered avocado toast and it was delicious! It came with a fried egg on top and a side salad which made it filling.  To start, the server brings out a small bowl of popcorn which is fun as well! Also it is DELICIOUS!   The reason I am giving this restaurant 3 stars instead of 4 is because our service was quite awful. Our server didn't come around for our drinks for almost 10 mins, only refilled our water once, spilled on us, never introduced herself, and complained to us about the new employees working that day. I understand being a server is very hard work, but part of the job is to put on a happy face for the customers and she did not do this.   However, I will come back and hopefully have a more positive experience with a different server and still be able to enjoy the food:)"}
{"text":"We went with our kids, which may not have been the best idea, since they are young. However, the waitstaff and food were phenomeal, so we were able to enjoy a great meal as a family."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place. The food is interesting enough to qualify as unique and the drink menu is plenty. My only complaint is that their drinks are expensive. I can go to blind pig, get a beer and old fashioned (with Makers) for the same price as one old fashioned at Big Grove."}
{"text":"Everything was just alright. I had the burger and the gin hopper cocktail which was 80% gin. It was very strong and not as flavorful as I thought itd be. Also my waitress was kinda weird, I think she just wanted me to get out of there asap...not welcoming at all. Would not go back."}
{"text":"I really like brunch at Big Grove!  The chicken hash and chili scramble are great; the cinnamon roll was nothing special.  The servers are nice, and the booths are comfy. I also love that they source their food locally!"}
{"text":"Apple slices caramelized onions arugula cheese curds house horseradish and stone ground mustard hamburger sweet potato chips and Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA. Demetrius provided outstanding service and spirit. Patio is nice but if the wind is up as it was for my visit go inside. Good selection of beers, I enjoyed the Belgo-American Blonde Soleman Oath Funsponge as well, nice feel on a warm afternoon. 27 USD for meal and beer, not home cookin' prices but I recommend all around."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i went downtown to eat and we decided to try this place. When we were seated the waiter seemed like he didnt want to be there(i dont blame him but it was rude) and then when we were seated, we sat there for 20 minutes without being asked what we even wanted to drink. After that we still werent helped so we left. So that was our experience at big grove tavern!"}
{"text":"I had the roasted turkey sandwich and my husband had the burger. They were both delicious and not too expensive. Also had the Busey Bramble cocktail and it was amazing! I will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Me and a group of friends went to this place last night.  We were all skeptical since we live in Chicago and never had a really good meal in Champaign - always average to below average.  This place surprised all 6 of us and we all ordered different things - the appetizers were great - deviled eggs and fried brussel sprouts - both great and I usually don't like deviled eggs.  I got the burger and it was real good - they forgot to put the egg on it like i ordered but brought me out an egg minutes later.  the drinks were really good too - had a bullet old fahioned.  All in all, definitely glad we went there and will definitely go back on the next visit."}
{"text":"I come to Big Grove probably once month or so. In general service is usually good enough. The food is tasty and drinks are great. The bartenders are usually awesome. Every restaurant has hiccups. However, today the service was atrocious and borderline disrespectful. I came to Big Grove for brunch to catch up with a friend. Upon walking in, I wasn't greeted by the receptionist and had to awkwardly initiate conversation and ask for a table. (You had one job, lady). The receptionist picks up menus and then zooms off without even saying \"right this way\" or \"follow me\" or anything. Our server was just rude, short and condescending. For example, when deciding on which mimosa to order, my friend inquired about how bitter the grapefruit mimosa might be, the server replied condescendingly \"Well it's grapefruit and champagne.\" Nothing more. All attitude. We were honestly confused by her extremely negative tone, but we tried to enjoy our experience. She continued to be unwelcoming and rude as my friend and I decided what we going to order, insisting in a negative tone \"you have to order a meal with the bottomless mimosa\"....treating us as if we weren't going to order anything. So, we asked if there was a different server that might be able to help us. She told us her manager would be right over. We sat for over 15 minutes before anyone came over, watching the \"manager\" and our former server continuously walk past & ignore us. Eventually the manager asks if we want more water?! We say yes and indicate that we asked for another server quite a while ago. The manager then confirms that she will be helping us now. Nothing more. We ask for a couple minutes because my friend received a short phone call and she walks away for another 15 minutes, continuously walking past us, but never checking on us. We had to flag her down to put in our order.  The manager never even inquired about the previous server's behavior or why we were dissatisfied with the service. We honestly just wanted to eat and catch up so we hated that we had to deal with that. No one ever apologized for the issues or even asked about them, which is concerning. How can you operate if you don't even care about your customers? The complete disregard for our time, money and experience was so evident."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so hit and miss... I've had their burger (great!), falafel (not so great), corn chowder (great!), clams (not good) and today was so awful that I couldn't even eat it.    They start you off with a popcorn bucket (great!) but it went down from there.  The waiter was slow and didn't even mention the  lunch deals on the flip side of the menu... I ordered a $13 sandwich off of the front and when I flagged him down to order off the lunch menu,  he didn't even try to accommodate. But anyway, I ordered a cheesesteak with a side of shaved Brussels sprouts.   Food came out in a timely manner.  The rest was awful -- the cheesesteak was dripping oil, the steak was sliced thick and was chewy/tough.  Hard to swallow.   I ate less than half of it.  The Brussels sprouts were inedible.  I like hot and spicy, but this was ridiculous.  It was peppery (where I was choking on it), eyes were watering and it didn't taste good.  The waiter said to just push the Fresno peppers aside and it'll be better (what?! Mixed veggie dishes cooked together in a skillet  don't really work like that.)   He assured me my glass of water would be full...10 minutes later I was still empty.  He came back and wondered if I wanted a box... and I said no because it was awful.   Manager offered me something else (along with dessert) but by that point, I had lost my appetite and lunch hour was almost over.  She just took 50% off the bill.... so I got a lunch deal, just no lunch."}
{"text":"Big Grove Tavern is a great place to get a few drinks and great food. My dad and I enjoyed some oysters, brussel sprouts, a burger, and fries together, had Matt as a server on a busy night and the staff was more than able to accommodate all of our needs. I would recommend this place to anyone that wants a nice place to enjoy dinner."}
{"text":"I guess I don't get it. Isn't the focus supposed to be local? So then why things like octopus and cod taking up space on the menu? There's plenty to be celebrated locally, and Big Grove seems to have a bit of an identity crisis.  We had the beef ribs. They were good and tender, but not much meat for the price. The cubed turnips on the side were almost raw and not good.  This was my second time and I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Ok, I had some low expectations coming in, considering Jim Gould's old restaurant was here, and that was a VERY big disappointment, i wasn't expecting a ton from Big Grove Tavern.  Tonight was my 3rd visit, but first for dinner and i was very pleased!  I had the Tavern Burger which is a beef, bison & pork burger, red onion marmalade, cornichon aioli, house-cut fries and added the Fried Egg.  I did not get the Aioli on my burger.  It was DELICIOUS!  for me the fried egg made this burger one of, if not THE best in Champaign/Urbana.  And i've had what is considered to be in the top 5 in america at Kuma's Corner in Chicago, its not that good, or that big, but its plenty excellent.  the house cut fries were very good too, i loved the seasoning.  my wife raved about the Beer Brined Pork Loin, saying it was \"delicious\".  The place is a little pricy, but they also have very close attention to detail and the food is all from local area suppliers, which is a nice touch and compliment to the local growers.  I will be back again at this restaurant, i can't wait to try the BLT with the egg at lunch next!"}
{"text":"It's good, it's expensive, it's nice.  Local food supplied.  And great popcorn starter!"}
{"text":"I came here for a business dinner, and it was a great experience!  I have to be honest with you - I've been underwhelmed by farm-to-plate concept restaurants before. I love the idea, the flavors can just get too off beat for me. Big Grove nails the basics, plus a twist - I thought the flavored popcorn appetizers were a great addition. I had the roast chicken and dumplings, and the whole dish was spot on. Beers on tap were great, and I had coffee with my meal (it was a rough day, don't judge me!) and it was quite good.  Oh, and the jazz band was great! That's a nice touch in my mind. The space really works with a string band, not overwhelming, not drowning out conversation, just a good addition.  I'm dinging a single star because espresso isn't on the menu. I know, at a brunch restaurant! And the cornbread was only OK. Not bad, but totally unremarkable. At least butter the top for me, guys. Really it was the lack of strong brews though.  I didn't mention - the sorbet was sublime!  I will say, the owner (or maybe an exec chef?) asked my party how dinner was on the sidewalk outside. I thought that was a nice touch to ask. You know what, I'm bumping this up to 5 stars, it's like a 4.5 flavor but a 5 for fun. Fix the cornbread and buy a Aeropress or a Mokaleti, and this place is aces."}
{"text":"Service is the reason Big Grove isn't getting a better review. I agree with previous reviewers who've said that it gets busy and the servers get overwhelmed.   During graduation weekend I attempted to make reservations for 10 (I know...bad idea!) and was told that they were only taking reservations for 8, which I understood, but the hostess proceeded to tell me that if more than 8 showed up she would be obliged to charge my credit card. I didn't argue over the 8 person rule, so why would that be her response?! On a separate occasion I've had my reservation lost which led to a 30 minute wait.    The food: the deviled eggs are always a delight and the drinks are above average. I find the entrees to be a hit or miss as they can sometimes be too salty but the burger is always a solid bet."}
{"text":"Our party of 6 ate here tonight and we loved it! Our server, Tricia was very attentive and friendly.  The brussel sprouts, shrimp and grits, burgers and steak medallions with truffle fries were all delicious."}
{"text":"Waited more than half an hour for the food to be served. Service was average. The food tasted pretty horrible -- I had the Big Grove Benedict, which had way too much sauce and too salty. Husband got the steak and eggs, which came out cold. Won't come back again."}
{"text":"I was so shocked to read on their website that the chef was from SF? Walking in, it's a cute spot! Nice decor and somewhat okay service - nothing that would stand out. But what runs a restaurant is the food, and we gave it plenty of tries.  In January we were in for a date night on the weekend and we told they had oysters! Oh how we miss them. The server seemed pretty confused on how they came, what they were and what sauce came with it, so we went ahead and gave it shot. How can you mess up an oyster, right? Well, good god this was so disgusting! The oysters were on ice, but filled to the brim with this gross creamy orange liquid that was tepid and just...GROSS! It totally covered the whole flavor of the oyster and was absolutely a disgrace to the beauty that's an oyster. So tepid sauce and somewhat cold oyster - feels like a temperature danger zone to me. So again, I'm thinking, the chef is from SF and she does that to an oyster?! Yikes. We then decided to not order dinner because of those oysters (and didn't want to seem like cheapskates) and got the chocolate budino. That dessert is supposed to be pudding-like, but was SO hard and impossible to put a spoon, knife and fork in. So we sat and waited for it to get a little softer, but it was more like a little jar of chocolate that was melted and then refrigerated back into a chocolate bar. That was in no way rich and creamy and custard-like. I would call it \"Chocolate Brick In A Cute Mason Jar\".  Came back again and had Sunday brunch as there are limited options in Champaign-Urbana. I ordered the chicken hash and my partner got the huevos rancheros...I think. My chicken hash was full of those bits of chewy cartilage-like chicken that you would, ya know, throw away! Not one piece was edible chicken. I felt absolutely jipped and told the server who didn't seem to care or knew what to do? And the scone we got was just a rock hard lump of dough over baked. I mean you could use that thing as a weapon, lol. So depressing for such a beautiful restaurant and concept. :-/  As some have said in their reviews, too: the food is nothing extraordinary. Honestly, for each of our experiences it was pretty gross and I couldn't tell if we came in on off times or what, but not impressed at all. Yuck."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic and so was the food. We couldn't stop eating the popcorn that they give you at the beginning. Everything is organic or from local farms etc so the taste is definitely fresher than most places. The ambiance is great for a date. Menu is a bit small and I got the chicken. Didn't expect it to come out whole but it was also completely boneless which was interesting. The burger was amazing but again, not a very big selection to choose from. Although might come back for lunch to see how the lunch menu is."}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful from the service to the food. We had the filet and the chicken. Everything was cooked to perfection. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Would definitely recommend Big Grove Tavern, it will become a regular dinner destination for us!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming.  I really wanted to like this place. I will literally try any restaurant that is Farm-to-table. I support the cause and want it to grow. However, Big Grove Tavern has left me dissatisfied both times I have eaten there.  The Food Milk braised pork shoulder (4/5) The best dish I've tried, would order again. Free-range roasted chicken (2/5) Decent portion but too dry and salty. Pan seared bistro filet (3/5) The meat was seasoned well but the portion was tiny. Mac-n-cheese (2/5) Dry and only tasted like bacon and onion. Fried Brussels sprouts (4/5) Definitely would order again Chicken liver pate, I'm not a fan of it to begin with so it wouldn't be fair to comment on.  The Drink A bit pricey but overall a good selection of wine, beer, and spirits.   The Atmosphere It's a very warm and welcoming restaurant that was thoughtfully designed. Definitely makes you feel like you are at a nice restaurant.   Take away Both entrees that i have personally ordered I was disappointed with. I expect more from a restaurant with entrees at this price point. I'll probably only return for drinks with friends."}
{"text":"I felt like I was in Chicago - a huge compliment to this downtown Champaign spot with it's locally sourced food and beer list.  We started with a truffle popcorn amuse, both savory and sweet, served in adorable mini tin buckets.  Having a bite of each of my friend's dishes - from butternut squash/goat cheese sandwich, burger and my own pulled pork (a bit dry and lacking on the slaw, but still quite tasty), I left satiated and ready to come back.  The beers come in small 10 ounce juice glasses if you just want a few sips, or you can go with a tall boy if you've designated a driver for the evening.  The artwork is mostly local, minus the large birch sculpture hanging over the bar.  It was such a great statement piece, that I might have to borrow the design aesthetic once I get my dream house.  Well done, Big Grove, I'll see you again soon."}
{"text":"My sister has insisted on taking us here on at least two occasions. When we objected Wednesday night, she said, \"I know it can be hit or miss.\" I have yet to see it be \"hit.\" In fact, it was such a \"miss\" on Wednesday that it flared my IBS that has been very solidly in remission for two months; thanks to this place  my Thanksgiving was MISERABLE. Honestly, the food always leaves a great deal to be desired when it comes to taste; I have always been disappointed in the portion sizes. The only redeeming qualities are the popcorn they put on the table and the desert...if that is worth agonizing stomach cramps, then have at it!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here! Brunch today, got the endless mimosa, so good! They had Apple and orange, orange was better. The complimentary brown butter brown sugar popcorn today is delicious! They have 10 different flavors. Service is spot on! Not once did we have to request our mimosa's or water be refilled. The food was great! Portions large too, had the south of the border hash, very filling and tasty! Will have to come back for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Living in Cincinnati, Ohio, it is all the rage to be a farm-to-table, in-season menu, locally-sourced restaurant. I love that scene so I was excited to try Big Grove Tavern for a nice dinner. I love that we could get a reservation at 8 p.m. and the service was wonderful. The menu looked very unique, flavorful and fun. However, none of the dishes blew me or my friends away. Everything was good and I appreciate how fresh the food was, but it all needed a little something more. The deviled eggs were awesome and so fun to order one at a time. Our wine was delicious and I appreciated their drink menu. The ambiance was cool as well. If I lived in Champaign I would go back, I just have a feeling that their meals are hit or miss."}
{"text":"I went to this place tonight and it was a nightmare. I've been in this college town for 7 years now and ate at most of the places here and this comes across as one of the worst. The waiter messed up the order, which I mean it happens. Then the steak comes out, and it was way too salty. The sauce was too salty as it is, and then they added sea salt on it. When I told my waiter about it, some manager lady in her 40-50s came and took it back to have it redone. She did not apologize but instead shrugged and said \"that's the way we cook it here\";  face was stone cold and gave us a new set of silveware without saying a word. Talk about customer service. I do not know how this place stays in business with a manager like this. Bottom line is, if you're looking for a quick eat, then the food here is ok, comparable to steak and shake quality but 3x the price. If you're unlucky enough like me to see that manager with an attitude, then you're in for an experience."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place but I'll be honest I was less than impressed and feel as though I got my hopes up. For starters we got the pretzel braid and brussels sprouts. The pretzel braid was odd, it was more bread tasting than pretzel and the mustard had a touch too much horse radish. The brussels sprouts on the other hand were outta this world good! They were glazed with balsamic vinaigrette I believe and had some sort of aioli on top. For my dish I got the Champaign Cheesesteak and that is where I was really let down. The sandwich was kind of bland, not a lot of flavor. I do like that they source their ingredients locally though. I would be interested in giving them another shot but for now I can't say I'm a huge fan."}
{"text":"Full disclosure- We were in town for an event! Graduation. So of course the restaurant was swamped.  But instead of having a nice selection for the brunch, they scaled back. We picked the wrong place when we wanted omelettes. But never the less we ordered the Big Grove breakfast and the food arrived fast and cold. Probably the worst breakfast I have ever had! 2 of us ordered this and the same thing on both. Cold and tasteless. A huge disappointment since the other members of our group ordered from the sides- \"eggs over easy\" which arrived over medium.  We did not complain or alert our server (who was attentive and friendly) because we did not want to cause a fuss since the entire place was in a frenzy! But I will NEVER return. Oh and we went here for the unlimited mimosas. They decided not to offer this promotion on our particular visit. . Geez thanks!"}
{"text":"You can put a fried egg on your already delicious, locally grown burger. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"TL;DR: Inconsistent food, at a high price. When they're on, it's great. When they're off, you spend $30-$40 per person on mediocre food. Good atmosphere, good service, good beer.  Full review:  Based on my two trips to the Big Grove, it seems to be hit or miss.  The first time I went, around January of 2014, I was extremely impressed. I had pork belly as an appetizer (amazing) with a Dogfish Head 90 minute to chase it down (the beer selection is pretty great). For dinner, I had a perfectly cooked steak (don't remember the cut), served alongside gnocchi. Everything I ate was relatively simple, but they executed perfectly on the local, farm to table ingredients (they're proud of that here). Service was fantastic.  The second time I went, in July 2014, the food was very disappointing. The steak was solid again, but it was served alongside one of the most bitter, poorly cooked broccolini I've ever had the displeasure of tasting. The pork tendorloin was chewy, definitely do not recommend. And this time, the pork belly appetizer was served differently, as a salad. I think it's pretty difficult to screw up pork belly, but they managed to do so. It tasted as if it were cooked a day ago, and it was difficult to find much pork belly beneath the greens.   Service was tremendous on both occasions. Our water and popcorn (the popcorn is great) were refilled consistently, and the waiter seemed to take pride in the food."}
{"text":"I heard about Big Grove Tavern a year ago and I just got to try it. It was such a good choice for Sunday lunch!  We were seated pretty quickly and it was nice to be outside. You can bring your dog if you want; It has to be on a leash. The kettle corn like popcorn was a sweet treat as a mini appetizer. Our server was really sweet and gave her opinion if we needed her help. I can't quite remember what I had because it was the special, but i thought it was delicious. It was two fried tortillas with black beans, rice, and salsa verde. It was topped with 2 fried eggs.   Big Grove Tavern is not a place where you go just to \"have lunch\". It is a  place where you know you will get a good meal while feeling good about yourself because local farmers' produce is used in all steps of production."}
{"text":"I love the concept and love the menu, HOWEVER something about the ambiance just doesn't feel right to me. I wish it was more \"taverny\", more cozy, and more warm feeling inside. To me it feels like a big open cold room and that's honestly the main reason I don't keep going back."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and we stopped by here! Very cool place, love the wrap around bar, love the art and just genera environment! Ordered a dirty martini and it was perfect! Boyfriend got the hickory burger, I got the black and bleu (with a perfect egg on top!) and the fries were to die for....I will not forget those fries!   Paris was our server, very nice, genuine, and attentive! If I wasn't careful, she would have made me get spend more money than I needed to! (That's the mark of a good server!) She sold me on the curry soup, which had a nice curry flavor, but was not as hot as this gal would I have liked it!  Overall, great experience and would come back again!"}
{"text":"I know the whole local concept is hip right now, but Big Grove does it right.  Plus the interior is cool, with open space and interesting visual detail (the branches on the ceiling).  And our waiter was on his game with recommendations and satisfying our motley crew's numerous requests.  Our group started with deviled eggs all around.  I tried to take a couple bites, but dang, it was good!  I would have ordered another but our food came pretty quickly after.  Deviled egg doggy bag anyone... or just me?  I had the turkey sandwich, which had so much flavor for a turkey sandwich!  Loved the bread, the cheese, the spreads.  Also ordered at our table was the Tavern Burger (which looked like a big, juicy meatball) and the chicken sandwich.  Their menu looks different now, which means rotating sandwich toppings and mains = never gets boring.  Their salads, bar snacks and starters all look amazing this time around too.  I plan to make this a regular lunch spot when I'm in the area.  Maybe dinner too, so I can try one of their fun sounding cocktails!"}
{"text":"Amazing entrees. Appetizers are very different and delicious. Apple and pear crisp for dessert. Best meal I've had in downtown champaign. Great ambience and music. Will be coming here more often."}
{"text":"For some unfathomable reason, I decided to give this place another shot with my mom for U of I's Moms' Weekend. It was a pathetic, embarrassing visit to say the least. I'll keep this as short as possible but we sat outside because the main dining room was booked up with reservations, which is totally understandable. What made the experience terrible was the fact that our waitress was so painfully inattentive and slow that we sat there for 10 minutes waiting for a cup of coffee. She told my mom \"we are having a coffee mug emergency, 50 of them just broke, so it'll take a while\" and then a couple minutes later, set two mugs of coffee down at the table next to us and loudly exclaimed, \"here are your coffees!\" If you're going to lie, at least come up with a better one. We also had to ask twice to have the honor of hearing the specials.   What made it even worse was that we were so sick of the lengthy wait (didn't even get any water) that we got up to leave and told the waitress that we wouldn't be dining here. She had the most disgusted look on her face and said \"okay, good!\" That's what made me go inside and complain to the manager -- and it just so happened to be the manager who thought I was lying about their rancid food making me sick last time! Without a shred of apology, I let him know that the waitress outside must be in a bad mood and that she needed some help in the outside dining area, since she was blatantly lying and letting us know that it's a good idea for us to leave!   Damn, this place really knows how to kill its own business. If you ever feel like giving this place a second try, just don't bother. The staff -- all the way from waiter to manager -- makes you feel like they're doing you the most tremendous favor. I can't wait to see this place get shut down."}
{"text":"Can you believe it? I've been here even more times since my last review. Whenever I eat out, everyone wants to come here because it looks so nice. Their food is pretty good. I love the concept behind Big Grove (locally sourced, fresh, seasonal menus) but the execution is, like, not on par with how beautiful this place is. It looks GREAT. Food looks great and tastes pretty good. Their real standout dishes are their desserts. Beautiful presentation. The interior is absolutely beautiful and it's a good atmosphere for dining. I think that helps amp up the food experience."}
{"text":"Great brunch experience! Our server Wyatt, was very informative and accommodating. We loved the mimosa bar and will be back again!"}
{"text":"I gave Big Grove Tavern two chances, both on a Sunday, and from the brunch menu, and their standard menu. I ordered a few of the same items during each visit, and some unique things during each visit.  The first visit, I tried the brunch menu selections that were offered that day. Service was between good and stellar. Drinks were never left empty, and multiple staff delivered food and beverages to help increase ticket times. The popcorn was nice, it seemed like a blend of thyme, turmeric and agave nectar. I had the steak fries with truffle fries. It turned out to be the half dollar sized medallions, that while tender and tasty, were not as filling as anticipated. The truffle fries, while decadent in flavor, were tossed with truffle oil for flavor, which seemed to diminish the value behind the $23 price tag. The meal was tasty, the presentation was weak, but the value seemed to lack slightly between the balance of plating, price point and flavor. I also had the deviled egg, a beautiful presentations, and oddly the star of the show on terms of plating, the sun dried tomato puree was definitely a solid choice in camping up this dish.  During visit two, I tried the pretzel as an appetizer, the deviled egg again, which was consistent with the last visit, and the pork belly tacos. The popcorn was absent this trip, given this was my second trip, I  wasnt sure if the popcorn came standard or not. The pretzel was still cold in the center, which is conducive to restaurants that do large prep batches and freeze things to maintain freshness and flavor to the table, however, if the restaurant kitchen is laid out similar to other high end establishments, the pretzel came from garde mange, and the chef didn't test the product with a cake tester or paperclip to make sure the center was warm prior to service and hide the evidence that he or she did test for a warm, fully cooked product. The pork belly tacos appeared to be a pre-cured portion of pork belly that was deep fried prior to plating, while I'm speculating on the exact preparation method, the over all flavor seemed to fall short of what I would anticipate of a staple menu item, while decent, I wasn't blown away by the dish, or the lack of salsa options at the table to add more spice should I desire, such as a bottle of cholula.  While the food was so close to being completely on point, the customer service does seem to be a priority here. And that is no small feat for any restaurant. The atmosphere was great, regardless of how busy the restaurant was or wasn't, and the staff seemed to present their very best efforts, relative to experience, during both visits. All in all, I lean towards three stars because the food seemed to fall just shy of the precedent set by the expectations, and as a foodie, I would've loved a better experience at the fork."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Big Grove.  We found it the first time traveling through Champaign via Yelp.  Tried it again while traveling at Thanksgiving.  A very nice find.  Interesting food, decent atmosphere and very good service.  And making the reservations via Yelp was very cool."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic experience here when I brought my parents.   Ordered the free range chicken, fried brussel sprouts and ended with a chocolate desert. The food isn't anything that is uniquely different, but it's really well done.   The service here was something that I really appreciated - our waiter was extremely tentative and polite, and was able to do some special changes to our dishes.  Really pleased with the ambiance, food and service. Would absolutely go back (with a reservation!)"}
{"text":"A huge snd expensive eatery that is pretty luxurious inside. The food offerings sre unique and set forth highly educated high expectation post graduate population in the area and nothing I would really be interested nor salivate for but this location did have good beer selections. I would recommend the place just for it as this is another great Champaign downtown bar/restaurant. Tge decor is fantastic especially liking the unique ceiling tree branchs"}
{"text":"straightforward delicious food, trendy but not too,  real locavore place."}
{"text":"Tried to go here for brunch on a Saturday morning. It was a beautiful day, and we noticed several open tables outside. However when greeted by the hostess, who was incredibly rude, we were told all tables would be filled due to a large party and all others were reserved. When we asked to wait for an occupied table, we were told no. The only tables we were offered were inside where no other customers were sitting.... On such a beautiful day we couldn't justify sitting in a dimly lit, empty restaurant.   Luckily there were plenty of other brunch spots across the street who were much more accommodating and friendly.   We will never try Big Grove again."}
{"text":"Delicious farm to table food. Not cheap but neither is the quality of the ingredients, so you get what you pay for. I think you have to be a foodie to dig this place, so haters beware."}
{"text":"Started off with hush puppies. These were pretty good. Nothing spectacular but solid. 3/5  I got the Tavern Burger. This was decent. I thought the seasoning was okay. But nothing really special about the burger itself. The flavored were enjoyable. However I thought the mix of the buffalo and pork with the beef burger kind of ruined the burger. It made it very springy and slightly rubbery. The fries that came with it saved the dish. I don't like how they are so short and you have to use a fork but the seasoning and the texture was as perfect as fries can get. 4/5"}
{"text":"A very trendy restaurant. I  like the beer selection. The food is hit or miss depending on the fresh ingredients they receive. Friendly staff can be pretty slow during the week."}
{"text":"Well I wish there was a way to leave a comment without giving any stars. Unlike everyone else who has commented on the bar I never actually got to eat any food from this place. I went in on Mother's Day/U of I graduation weekend. I totally understood leaving the house that most restaurants in town would be crowded so we would experience some wait time pending where we went. We selected Big Grove to celebrate Mother's Day. Upon walking up to the restaurant there were people outside eating but the area was not crowded at all. When we entered the restaurant/bar it was less crowded inside than it was outside. It was approximately 4:30 pm. We were greeted with how may I help you. We asked for a table for four. We were told unless you have a reservation we would have to sit at the bar. My youngest child is three years old so that was not a safe seating arrangement. We are from Chicago, so we are very familiar with the reservation protocol most restaurants use. My husband asked what the reservation hold wait time was and the man stated that it was 20 mins but the place was far from crowded inside and out. Everyone knows there are plenty of times when reservations are made with the intention of eating out but plans change. I have a hard time understanding a business that is for profit turning down right now money for possible money if the people keep their reservation. It's just not good business. From the looks of the reviews that weekend was not a good weekend for this restaurant/bar and it doesn't appear that a missed much from the cuisine aspect either because the reviews about the food are very inconsistent."}
{"text":"The wait staff was incredibly kind and helpful when I came in with my family for Easter dinner. I have a soy allergy and I usually can't eat out in the Midwest. Everywhere uses soy oil. Unfortunately, Big Grove was not an exception, but their willingness to accommodate my needs was above and beyond. I should have called ahead knowing it would be busy, but it was Easter and the day just got away from me. With my food allergies I am constantly having to plan ahead and on holidays, it is doubly hard. When we got to the restaurant I realized my mistake. I was so nervous when our server came back and told me the oil they used across the menu had soy in it. But, she immediately set my mind at ease telling me they were able to find a steak and some steamed/grilled veggies for me. They really didn't want to hurt me and it was so clear that they cared. That means a lot. LIKE A WHOLE LOT. I probably won't go back unless it's for a family event because I don't like making folks jump through hoops for my special body. I would like to urge Big Grove and restaurants in general to stop cooking with cheap soy/vegetable oils, with love!"}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in Champaign!  Great ambience, fresh food, unique menu featuring locally grown foods. We love the Sunday brunch. Traditional options available, but also unique menu items. If you can snag a table outside during good weather, it is even better!"}
{"text":"enjoyed the salmon and the waiter was very good. they served up some falfel I can only describe as a stale rabbit turd. kill it with fire"}
{"text":"Big Grove is a ditz. Nice to look at, but there's nothing really there.  Take the menu for example. It's the size of the bill, just more upsetting. All six inches of it, beautifully fastened to the silver rings of a time-worn clipboard, boast an incredible twelve total items - including appetizers and drinks. Or something like that.  What about the food, you say? Good question. The portions are tiny. There is one steak on the menu - a hanger steak. You just always leave feeling let down."}
{"text":"Don't go here. We went here for my brother's rehearsal dinner. We had terrible service and terrible food. All of the food was cold and the chicken was still bleeding! And then they were trying to charge us for drinks we never got. We went to the manager to discuss this but he blew us off. What a terrible experience!!  I attached a photo of the pile of raw chicken (our main course)everyone took off their plates. Still praying no one has food poisoning.  Luckily we were with a fun group of people and managed to have a good time. But I would not recommend this place to anyone, especially for a large event like our rehearsal dinner."}
{"text":"When I need a comfort meal after a long day of work in the Champaign area, my mind immediately goes to Big Grove's tavern burger!  It's a blend of beef, bison & pork, you can add cheese, and it has an aioli on top.  I've tried it bunless, and the meal is equally as satisfying sans bun bc the meat is so juicy and flavorful!  Each time you dine in, you get a little tin of complimentary seasoned popcorn of the day.  Nice touch.  Another nice touch is the olive oil drizzle you can request on the vanilla ice cream for dessert!  On my latest visit, I wandered in at brunch time and tried the chilaquiles.  Based on my previous dinners here, I had high hopes for the dish, but my heart sank with my first bite, as the pulled chicken was cold.  I was able to find a few pieces that were lukewarm, but that was disappointing.  The two poached eggs were bordering on cold too, so they had obviously been poached earlier.  Atleast the tortilla chips were crunchy...  I also appreciated the fresh cup of decaf brought to me mid-meal, since the kitchen had just brewed a fresh pot.  I would've enjoyed a meal as hot as that coffee!  Last notes: I liked the strings of lights hanging from the ceiling, ornaments hanging by the bar, and snowflakes drawn in the window.  Very festive!  Music playing was right up my alley too, so I enjoyed the ambiance.  The burger gets 5 stars, but the chilaquiles experience was 3, so it averages out to a 4."}
{"text":"The Southwest Steak salad was so good! Their Oysters were so fresh and delicious as well. They have awesome seating inside and outside and, randomly, I loved the music they were playing.  They have a full bar and their signature cocktails are pretty good! They serve a free appetizer of popcorn, which was different but pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Great outdoor dining space, especially enjoyable on a busy weekend or evening.  Service is good, our waitress checked on us many times to ensure we were happy and taken care of.  The food is good, but on the pricy side for what you are ordering. I prefer Big Grove for Happy Hour and Drinks....always generous on the pours, staff makes sure you drink isn't empty, and great flavored popcorn to snack on."}
{"text":"I have come to Big Grove several times with my husband, with friends, and with family. On nearly every occasion, we have had terrible service. Our waiters and waitresses have either completely forgotten about our table, have been rude, or have gotten our orders wrong on every visit. One time, we waited over 30 minutes to give our order and when we got our food it was completely wrong.  That said... Big Grove is a gorgeous restaurant with beautiful decor, and the ambience and hope of \"what if, this time things are different..\" keep me coming back. I really love bringing out of town guests here to check out the bar, but now we typically just get cocktails or dessert after dining at another establishment nearby. Their brunch menu is very good, and, if you can get a good waiter/ress, it is worth the stop."}
{"text":"It was our first time for brunch here. Me and my friend both were very dissapointed with our choices. I ordered avacado toast thinking I couldn't go wrong with avacado. Seems like I could. The salad on the side was soggy, avacado on the toast was brownish.Eggs were just blah. It definitely didn't taste good. I could only take a few bites that's it. My friend ordered the daily special which sounded good but taste was also very poor. Coffee was quite weak and cold. Service was great though. I usually like this place for dinner, their burger is nice. Definitely do not recommend for a brunch."}
{"text":"Good food.  Were facinated by the bar bits and starters, so decided to go with a nosh dinner had smelts, pickeled veggies, pate, parsnip and celery root soup, deviled eggs, chopped salad, and mac cheese.  All the food was good and for a newly opened restaurant the service was amazingly together.  We even had a wine by the glass which was corked and they fixed it without problem.  The wine list was not deep, but what they had was reasonably priced.  All in all if you were looking for a gastro-pub in Champaign, this fits the bill."}
{"text":"Really didn't enjoy this place. Had a burger it was just OK but not worth the price. Other food at my table was equally disappointing. For their location, decor, and price point we expected a lot more. The best thing we ate flavor wise was the complimentary popcorn provided to each table."}
{"text":"We eat at Big Grove about once a week and definitely consider it our favorite restaurant in all of Champaign-Urbana! The food is excellent and everything about this place is getting better all the time. Tell everyone you know about CU's newest and most thought out restaurants is right in the middle of our growing downtown. Local, well made, and comfortable. Thank you, Big Grove!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch this past weekend. Had a pleasant experience overall. They have the best location in downtown Champaign with ample indoor and outdoor seating area. The brunch menu had an adequate selection and there was also a special menu with about 4 items on it which might have been seasonal or temporary. The deviled eggs are a must try. They have a wide range of drinks but the juices are nothing special and as for coffee they do not have any speciality coffee such are lattes or cappuccino just plain espresso. The brunch is only on the weekends so it's a good place to spend your free mornings."}
{"text":"This came very well reviewed on Yelp and Open table. Hey! Its a Tavern! How bad could it be?   I was wrong...  I was down in the U of I area during homecoming and made a reservation just in case it was packed for an early dinner. When we arrived, the place was empty. We were taken to our table and given this small one page menu. I thought it was the drink menu, but no, it was the dinner menu. A bit suprised, I asked my father if he would rather go to DESTIL across the street, but he wanted to try this new local joint.   We decided that I was going to get the \"famous\" burger and my dad was going to get the Mac and Cheese. Our server came over and my dad started by ordering the Mac and Cheese, but he asked if he could get it without the onions (shallots and leeks). He was told NO because they already have it premixed. Premixed? She assured him that there was not alot of onions so we continued. For $12 on the burger and $14 for the Mac and Cheese, we were expecting something spectacular.   My burger came out. It was a mix of bison, beef, and pork. I was expecting something very flavorful. It was bland as could be. Also, it was about 1/8 of a pound. One of the smallest burgers I have ever eaten. The fries that came with this was good, but the dish was not worth it.   My dad's Mac and Cheese came out in a small bowl and half of it was made up of shallots and leeks. I tasted it and thought that it was good, but he HATED it. We had the manager called over and he took it away and took it off of the bill without us asking. He asked if we wanted something else, but my dad complained that the menu was too small for him to go with anything else. Instead of apologizing, the manager told him \"well its all local\" and he walked away.   Our server was nice, but I could overhear the hostess and the manager talking about future reservations for the night with an attitude and snarky responses to each other. People can hear you folks!  It was as if they were doing us a favor by being open.   In short, skip this place and go to other places within a block of this place. They know how to treat their customers and not to overcharge. I would suggest Guido's!"}
{"text":"We went for an early Saturday night dinner, drawn in by new fine dining in the area (which is limited) and the promise of local farm to table style. We are huge fans of many local farm efforts, which can be sampled at the Common Ground Co-op and the Market at the Square on Saturdays at Lincoln Square Mall -- and now, Big Grove Tavern.  First, the food, from a foodie perspective: Fresh product, well selected and well cared for. The flavors of the natural food are highlighted. The preparation is often minimally invasive. The technique is classic French. The flavor profile is quiet.   My partner and I both wished for something a touch bolder. For example, the deviled eggs, a pre-starter, have yolks mixed with peas. We would suggest adding an acid note, perhaps a pickle.   It was nice that they brought out flavored popcorn as a freebie with our drinks -- a feature at BGT. The flavor of the night was white truffle oil -- and you could taste the oil. That was a real win.  For starters, my partner had the chili and cornbread, and I had the chicken liver pate with pickled onions and stewed rhubarb. I think mine was better -- really delicious, with rich, deeply flavorful pate contrasted against the rhubarb, which gave the bite the sweet and sour it needed to cut through. The farmstyle, whole grain bread had a wonderful crunch. The cornbread was a bit too refined -- it needed  more crust and less cake, more corn flavor and less cafe baked-good sweetness. The chili was savory, but mild--no real taste of chilis.  The entree and dessert courses were both very good, especially dessert. My partner had the short ribs, which were beautifully medium rare -- not a hint over or under. I had the roast chicken with dumplings, which was amazingly good. Crisp skin, moist and flavorful meat, with a delicious herb broth under. Three dumplings that tasted like a delicate stuffing and had a satisfying bite. Slices of asparagus that also had a nice bite and a lovely green flavor still -- not at all cooked out. The portions seemed just right -- not too much and not too little.  For dessert, my partner had the rhubarb crisp and i had the chocolate pot de creme. Both were really superb: refined, flavorful, rich, balanced. Nothing fussy -- just satisfaction in every bite, with very good coffee on the side (they use a medium blend from the Columbia Street Roastery -- a fine choice).  The food is not bold. Or experimental. Or imaginative. But it is good, very good -- much better, I thought, in terms of technique than Carmon's Bistro.  It's clear from the limited but well selected menu that the chef behind it is attempting to appeal to middlebrow Midwestern tastes, but doing it in such a quality way that I found it kind rather than condescending. People who don't necessarily like a chi-chi dining experience will enjoy the food, and those who do like fine dining will think it is predictable in its selections but well done nonetheless.  Second, the decor and atmosphere: I generally like the blend of industrial and contemporary tavern that the interior designer seems to have been going for, although the dark colors dominate a little too much, despite the effort to add bits of fun in the lighting options.   BGT has a chic, young vibe -- somewhere between casual and serious. Dark gray walls with a black drop tile ceiling, black wire-cage pendant lamps with industrial bulbs of different shapes (reminds me of the recent Restoration Hardware line), bleached branch chandeliers over the bar area, outdoor party-lights with clear exposed globe bulbs interlaced with raw blond planks (one off note: the planks have lumber-yard stamps, which may be a bit too low-end for what they were going for),  fairly inexpensive light-wood grain tables and nicely selected dark chairs--if a bit flimsy--and booth upholstery. I hope that over time BGT will invest in some better art pieces, and ones that bring more interest and warmth to the interior. There's seating outside too, if you're a smoker or don't mind getting it second hand.  Third, cost: Yes, yes, it's on the expensive side. BGT is fine dining, not family dining. I won't be eating here every night either. Of course, any diner can make the meal more affordable by just sticking with an entree, rather than getting the whole shebang -- I'd guess for dinner that this would run you $20-25 tops. But if you have a deeper pocket that night, the whole shebang here could run you $100 with tip for two -- and you still won't feel cheated. The value is here, given the quality of experience.  Fourth, service: BGT has a young, eager service staff. They took good care of us, and every other table I could see. From beginning to end, we enjoyed our time here."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with this meal. The server was incredibly friendly, but they must have been short staffed. Everything took way too long to come out. Even coffee refills were slow. Not sure if it was a backup in the kitchen or a backup getting things out.   The food was very underwhelming. I ordered a standard breakfast. My eggs were not cooked over medium like I asked for, they were definitely hard. The toast was overcooked and burnt. And the potatoes were just a bit undercooked. Disappointing for such a simple breakfast.   My dining companions all agreed that the food was luke warm or cold. They must have had some issues with running the food to the tables. In fact, when the assistants came out to bring the food, they had no idea what we had ordered.   While we were dining, assistants came by at least three times with other tables' food. They definitely need to train their staff to understand how the tables are numbered and how to bring the food out to a large party. Staff seemed generally confused on how to run a restaurant.   Our waiter did remove items from the bill since we waited so long for our food. That was appreciated. But unfortunately, since the food just wasn't good, we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of this place. The food is alright. The prices are a bit high and the whole place seems snooty to me. There are so many options of restaurants in the area I would not recommend this one over the others. The staff also seems less pleasant than most."}
{"text":"When I feel like treating myself and spending my student loan money unwisely, Big Grove Tavern is always a good idea. Their cocktails, food, and overall ambience keep bringing me back. My ONLY complaint is that they discontinued guava mimosas. They were fantastic. Otherwise, brava!"}
{"text":"Personally not a huge fan of their menu as it doesn't appeal to my palette but I can see how others would find something they like. I'm giving them three stars because the kitchen was great in preparing a dish that my mom who has a handful of allergies on top of being vegetarian could eat.  My mom and I started with the pretzel appetizer that tasted nothing like a pretzel to us and instead like challah bread. It was decent just not what we were expecting. Then we shared the strawberry spinach salad which was nothing more than average. Just a handful of spinach leaves with a small handful of toppings. The house made dressing was the best part of that salad.   For our main course we had the ricotta gnocchi with some modifications for my mom's allergies and it once again was good but nothing I would think of coming specifically back for. Overall I was a bit bummed about my evening at Big Grove Tavern as I was previously very excited about having a great meal with my mom while she was in town visiting."}
{"text":"Big disappoint.  Lovely space and ambiance.  Server was nice and knowledgeable.  Cheesy grits and Deviled egg was good.  All 4 entrees were served lukewarm and mediocre for the prices.  Avoid the pork loin dish. Looked like a proceeded patty. Burger was cold. Filet small and had a bitter green served with it.  Free range chicken was small but was best of of bunch.  Dessert menu choices were weird. Would have sent it all back but didn't want to totally ruin dinner."}
{"text":"My brunch experience here was kind of an odd disaster. Went with a group of 4 and only 3 of us got our food for a good 30-45 minutes, even though I ordered the same thing as the 4th person without his food (chili omelet). We asked several times and finally his omelet came, at which point our food was cold while waiting. I also ordered endless pineapple mimosas and they brought orange. When I realized it was orange, I asked about it and the waiter first told us it was in fact pineapple, then acted like he mixed up the order, then admitted that he purposely brought out the orange because the pineapple batch hadn't been prepared yet, all in the same strange speech. (Do they have workers in the back rigorously squeezing pineapples into a jar? I don't know). The food was fine but I wouldn't recommend eating an omelet cold.   The manager ended up picking up the tab for all 4 of us after I complained, which I really appreciated (he first tried to just reimburse the 4th person but I didn't think that was appropriate).   The next time I went was also filled with order blunders. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with no mayo and it came with no blue cheese dressing. When I bought it up, they just sprinkled blue cheese on it. My girlfriend ordered a pasta dish that wasn't bad but the bread tasted like ash.   I'm not really much of a stickler for these sorts of things, but when it continues to be a pattern, small things tend to build up and it becomes apparent that the culture here is really not all that customer-centered."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed by Big Grove Tavern.  I came in with a group of friends for lunch one day, and while the service was nice, the environment fine, the food was just completely underwhelming.  I ordered the burger for lunch, with a side salad.  The burger was incredibly difficult to eat, and not due to excessive size, or the usual suspects.  I added an egg for 1.50, which turned out to be a mistake.  Although the flavors were OK, the bun just wasn't able to hand and got soggy, the burger decomposing as I ate it.  The proportions were off, and the lack of spectacular taste just made the meal messy with no upside.  The lettuce was completely wilted under the burger and the onions were entirely too sweet.  Similarly, the salad was unfortunate.  Too much dressing and an overly generous hand of salt and citrus made the salad too salty and sour.  For the entire meal, I paid $17 including tax and tip, which is OK for a downtown area.  However, I'd suggest that you check one of the other places around if you're looking for a solid burger."}
{"text":"Big grove was my favorite restaurant in Champaign but lately the service and food have been fairly disappointing. The Tavern burger, was in my opinion the best burger in CU but they ve definitely cut corners and it shows.  I went to Sunday brunch with my boyfriend. We expected it to be busy but didn't expect to not be serviced whatsoever from the waitresses. Now I don't mean to sound like yelp snob but we had to ask for everything: for water, for menu, for drinks, for our check. It was as if we weren't there. Because it was sunday brunch we didn't think it was so much a problem until the same waitresses serviced a small group right next to us and even had time to start a conversation about their personal lives.  Because we had been to big grove before we were expecting the same tavern burger as before. What we got was an extremely bland burger with a different set of ingredients than before (old burger did not have lettuce, raw onion, or tomato). For something that tasted like a backyard burger, I think $13 is excessive. Because it took about 50 mins to get burgers and like 15 full mins for water, we ate our burger rather than get it re done and we left. I don't think we ll be back anytime soon"}
{"text":"We had our wedding shower this weekend, and it was a great time. They did a good job with setting up the room, and the food was great, as well as the service. The events team was great at communicating with us ahead of time and even let our family come in early to decorate the room.   The only down side was that they broke the custom wedding cake topper that my fiancé got for me, as a surprise. It was part of the themed cake, and when the staff took the cake back to the kitchen, they neglected to care for the topper. When we asked for it, they brought it out with part of it snapped off. We were very disappointed to have such a lovely keepsake ruined. So, I am removing one star from this review."}
{"text":"We went here for a rehearsal dinner. This was absolutely the WORST place we have ever been. DO NOT GO. The food was cold. The chicken was RAW. We did not get served for over an hour at a time. The male manager was incredibly rude. We never want to go back to a place like this."}
{"text":"I didn't know pancakes and eggs required such lengthy care from the kitchen staff. We waited 10-15min to be seated which is not bad at all. And because we had plans we all were ready to order when the waiter came by.   Two orders of the local omelet, the pancake meal, a salad, and French toast. This took almost an hour. Yes. An hour. The waiter said he was checking continuously because even he realized the wait was unnecessary.   They need to tell their hens to do better. Egg meals are not difficult to create. I mean the food was decent but not even 4 star. I'm being generous with this three. They rushed and left the skin of an avocado in the eggs. (I have the picture...sticker n all.) And trust me, I don't sit and watch the clock while out to eat with others but this was just too much waiting for a small town meal. Heck we never even got the extra syrup we requested."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here for lunch!  Love the menu and how spacious it is."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles on Tuesday = The bomb.   I eat here all the time. It's absolutely fantastic bomb meal that my mom makes me on the farm. Simple fresh ingredients along with master chef skills.  If you like drinking... The patio pounder compliments this immensely.  Great staff and service. I love this place."}
{"text":"Yesterday my girlfriend and I had dinner at Big Grove. First, we had the french fries. They were incredible. We really loved the malt vinegar aioli. Second, she had the short rib and I had the mac and cheese. Everything about the short rib dish was perfect. I mean, really everything tasted amazing. The mac and cheese was just not as cheesy as I want out of my mac and cheese. The bacon tasted good in the dish but I probably wouldn't get it again. (5 stars for everything besides the mac and cheese. 3 stars for the mac and cheese)."}
{"text":"Great staff, good food, pleasant atmosphere. Enjoyable casual, but still nice, dining experience."}
{"text":"Pub burger and Brussel sprouts were great and Katie gave us the best service.  What a fun place!"}
{"text":"Yeah!  This place is yummy!  In every way.   The burger was excellent-made us want another one.  Fries were great.  My chicken liver Pâté was soooooo good with jelly and the bread  was divine.   My Mac n cheese was good and smoky, a little dry but could tell it was individually made and good.  Bartender, Lisa was enthusiastic and attentive!  Can't wait to come back and eat.  Might have to get back in here tomorrow.  Lol"}
{"text":"I have been to Big Grove Tavern several times and have yet to be satisfied with the service or the menu. The menu is small and underwhelming. I had the trout dish last time and was extremely disappointed with the tiny piece of fish in the center of the huge plate it was served on. Not much flavor, not satisfying. The only menu item I would recommend is the Tavern burger.   The service here is soooo slow. I took my mom here when she was visiting last month, wanting to give this place another try since the restaurant overall does have a nice atmosphere inside compared to other nearby places. Unfortunately I was disappointed again. It took our waiter too long to greet our table and then again too long to bring us our drinks. I ordered a pecan beer that he had suggested and when I tasted the beer, it seemed a little off but I figured that was just the flavor of it. Our meal took about an hour and a half to come out...and all we had ordered was a burger and the free range chicken dish. I think our waiter had forgotten to put in our orders till later. The couple seated next to us after we arrived had their meals a half hour before we did. When the check arrived, I see that my beer was in fact a $10 cider, not a $5 beer. Guess my taste buds were right. We paid the bill and left without complaining because we didn't feel like being there any longer than we were. Look, I understand things go wrong in restaurants and the server can't always control how long food takes and mistakes can be made. I am a server so I've been there. But I would've appreciated it if our server tried to do something to make up for our lackluster experience here. Not coming back here."}
{"text":"Here's the deal.  The food was ok about a 2.5, but when combined with the moronic answers I received from the manager on duty I determined this place is run by a neutered group of men, including the manager.  It starts with, I'd like sliced tomato on my hamburger.  Response: \"Chef only slices tomato for lunch not dinner\". Wtf  Then, I'd like some a1 steak sauce please with my burger.  response: \"chef doesn't allow us to carry a1\"   Then, I'd like some Tabasco with my fries.  Response: \"chef only allows us to carry certain condiments, we have some cha lula and some siracha\". I'm like what the hell are you kidding me????  I then asked to speak with the manager.  He said the chef runs every everything and she has complete say.  I asked who he reports to and he couldn't say.  I asked for the owners contact info, either email, phone or snail mail, and was given three names as-if I'm supposed to look them up myself when I was merely trying to do them a favor by letting them know how ridiculous this was.  I think I'll do myself a favor by not dining here again."}
{"text":"Our party of three had an excellent experience and meal.  Everything was fresh.  Our menu selections included a beef. lamb, and burger entree.  The service was great, and the wine selection was perfect."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. Overall, this business is extremely inconsistent with their service. However, the only thing their consistent with is the lack of service provided. A waitress by the name of Vanessa, actually stated that we should not come back. My friends and I have never experienced such poor service from waitress and the waiters on staff. Their is a lack of communication from the serving staff to the kitchen staff. Finances were NEVER an issue, but politeness is a PRIORITY. The staff is rude and NOT concerned with the overall production of service. With politeness, this business is unconcerned with their customers and their orders has ALWAYS been incorrect, something is always wrong. I WOULD NOT recommend this restaurant to others as their own employee sated, \"Do not come back.\" Epic fail! My friends and I was accused of verbally abusing the employees at company. However, the purpose of them stating that there was nothing to be done. The truth is that they are incapable of providing exceptional service to their customers. If management cannot handle the issue at hand, then I would NOT recommend this restaurant for experience. For management to state that MY friend's and I NEVER to return, is absurd!"}
{"text":"We came here for Saturday brunch and it was delicious! Our server, Trisha, was fantastic. My friend expected the fried egg BLT to be over hard; when he brought it up, she brought a new sandwich free of charge. She was so polite and pleasant- definitely a master of mixing mimosa flavors :) I love coming here for brunch and would recommend the South of the Border Hash."}
{"text":"I love Big Grove!! I cannot recall a bad experience, and I wrote a review Sept 2016 saying just that. Nothing has changed! I'm adding another great review for anyone looking for a vegetarian/vegan-friendly restaurant. I went back to Big Grove last week, with a newly adopted vegan diet. The server was friendly as always, and very knowledgeable/helpful for wine selections as well as helping me to choose a vegan dish... the Coconut Milk Curry is vegan as is, so I got that. It was incredible! And happened to pair well with the wine I had chosen (Cab-Sauv, Chile). I am going back to Big Grove next week for my birthday dinner, and asked for future reference about more vegan options. For a restaurant that doesn't advertise being \"vegan friendly\", Big Grove has a small handful of dishes that can be made vegan!! I totally recommend Big Grove for the service, food, atmosphere, and a great dining experience :)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere? Fun and trendy. Food? Average.  Initially, I was really excited to try this place while staying in Champaign. First off, I love farm-to-table restaurants and Big Grove Tavern does a really great job of utilizing local and regional farms. One of my favorite parts of the restaurant is a large map displayed on their wall that pinpoints where each of their ingredients comes from - how awesome is that!   When it comes to the restaurant's atmosphere, it's trendy mix of both contemporary and rustic chic. The ceilings are lit with old-fashioned string lights and vintage lightbulbs, and hanging above the bar are driftwood chandeliers.   After flipping through the clipboard dinner menu, I decided on the free-range roasted chicken with herb dumplings, green beans, shiitake mushrooms, and fingerling potatoes. The portion size is good, but the flavor was not anything spectacular. The chicken was juicy, but the rest of the dish was undercooked - especially the green beans and fingerling potatoes. All in all, this average tasting dinner dish was not worth $19.   For dessert I decided on the girl scout thin mint brownie sundae, complete with mint ice-cream, brownies, chocolate ganache, and sprinkled with peppermint candy (I mean come on, who doesn't love thin mints?) It may have been served in a glass goblet, but unfortunately my expectations of this dessert were much too high. The brownie and ice-cream were good, but the whole dish was overloaded with crushed peppermint candy - it ruined the flavor of the rest of the dessert! I would not recommend wasting $7 on this glorified sundae.   Next time I'm in Champaign, I'll be trying out another restaurant in hopes of getting my money's worth."}
{"text":"This was some of the best food I've had in the Urbana-Champaign area! The vegetarian Mac n cheese was probably superior to ever Mac n cheese that I have had prior and I am now changed due to this! The service was top-notch too!"}
{"text":"A welcome addition to downtown Champaign. The menu is unique and changes often. They strive to use locally-sourced ingredients and the wait-staff has been nothing but friendly and helpful. Every dish that I've eaten there has been absolutely melt-in-you-mouth fantastic. Seriously, try the roast chicken. They also offer a selection of house cocktails that are very tasty. Prices are about on par with the other \"fancier\" restaurants downtown which is to say that you can easily get an entrée and a drink for between $15 and $25. You can certainly spend more and if you try, you can get out for under $10 a head.  The atmosphere feels relaxed and trendy, the decor is pretty awesome, and I have to say that I love their music selection. It's current and recognizable without being overplayed or desperately obscure. Big Grove is high on my list if I feel like having a nice dinner."}
{"text":"The tavern burger tastes average.  Service is kind of slow."}
{"text":"I want to like this place.  I really do!  The food can be quite good!  I would have given this place 4 stars if not for the service, which has been some of the worst I have received in Champaign-Urbana.  More on this shortly.  I love select dishes on the menu, but I feel like you have to know what to order.  The burgers are INCREDIBLE.  I never want to eat another burger that is not a mix of beef, bison, and pork.  Awesome.  And the fries with it are great!  As much as I enjoy the burgers, there are times that you want some variety.  I know that it is trendy to include deviled eggs on a menu, but this are nothing special.  However, I feel like the pretzel makes up for this.  The pretzel is great and if you like your mustard with a HEAVY amount of spicy horseradish, this is for you!  I also really enjoyed the pork belly, but wish it was larger than just a starter.  All of that being said, all of my recent experiences there have been a service disaster!  We have enjoyed going for the Friday outdoor concert series because we can sit outside and enjoy dinner, a beer, and the music.  In fact, until the service problems began we would go every week religiously.  Earlier in the summer the service was not a problem.  However, the past several times we have gone, we have literally had to BEG to be waited upon.  Each of these times, we have arrived, been seated, and then waited for 20-30 minutes before any server came to our table to even take a drink order.  We have had to ask the hostess or manager, some times several times in the same meal, to have one of the wait staff come to our table just to take an order.  The last straw was when the same friend was there for TWO DIFFERENT MEALS IN A ROW (seated at an entirely different table) and she too was talking with the management to try and get someone to take our order.  The paranoid person in me worries that this lack of service is because we came with a small child.  Our child is quite well-behaved in a restaurant, but we try to be courteous and go for very early dinners when we know she will not be a problem.  We always try to order the full meal (drinks, dinner, dessert) up front and ask that the bill be given to us when the drinks arrive so we can make a quick get-away if necessary.    My point is that this is the one time that we actually get to go out and enjoy an adult meal and activity and I don't want it regularly spoiled by bad (or nonexistent) service, regardless of whether or not it is because I have a child with me.  I have wasted this time for several weeks in a row at Big Grove and don't plan on doing so again for a long time.  There are plenty of other options in the area."}
{"text":"My group of 5 did brunch at Big Grove Tavern on Easter Sunday.  I was excited to support a Farm to Table concept eatery, but overall was disappointed with both the food and the service.    I know it was Easter Sunday, but service should not be slow.  Either staff accordingly or don't take as many reservations. There is no reason there should be a 35-45 minute lag from the time our food was ordered until it was brought to the table.  Not sure if it was just our waiter (can't remember his name) or all the servers, but neither food or drink made it to the table in what I would say is a reasonable period of time.    We had a bit of a skirmish with our waiter shortly after being seated and given water.  I was pointing out to one of my dining companions (nicely) that the water glasses were very small and I hoped our waiter wasn't going to mind refilling mine often (I take hydration seriously) when our waiter appeared to take our order. Another of my dinner companions pointed out the glasses were small and bet the waiter wished they were bigger and the waiter didn't smile or agree. He just looked blankly at us and said \"well we all wish for things we don't get\".  Talk about it being a bit awkward after that.  We ordered a variety of brunch items. I will pause here to say that we saw little bowls of popcorn on the other tables, but none was ever brought or offered to us. I gather from the other Yelp reviews here that we missed out.  We ordered the cinnamon role to share. It was okay. Not very warm and the frosting just kind of sat on top, it didn't melt into the roll.  I ordered the pancake breakfast with the eggs over hard.    At our table we also had the salmon benedict, the brunch omelet (with chorizo and salsa verde) and the burger.  The consensus on all the food is as follows:  the omelet was the best thing on the table, it was huge, full of flavorful ingredients and absolutely covered in a spicy salsa verde. We all wished we had ordered it.  The salmon benedict was good, a little bland but decent. The burger was ordered medium rare and came medium, after waiting almost an hour we were not about to send it back. The fries that came with it were wonderful. Thin cut and so crispy. The aioli (sp) served with it was extremely good too.  The pancakes were nothing special, on the bland side. The eggs were overcooked. The bacon was good and crispy.  I might add that throughout the meal my water glass was empty more often than full. Every time I saw the waiter (or any waitstaff) I asked for water. Seriously, the glasses are that small.  I think (no, I am pretty sure) that our waiter was very annoyed with the requests for water by the time we left.  I am in Champaign on a regular basis. There are so many good places to eat. I love the concept and menu, just encourage Big Grove to step their game up a little. People are fickle and will start going elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place has come a long way since they first opened.  The food is fresh, seasonal, and interesting.  The flavors are diverse and well-balanced, and the preparation is excellent.  The waiter we had is fantastic; I knew him from his days as a the cafe manager at Borders, and I was happy to bump into him.  The decor is still great, if a little spartan.  The only \"cons\" to me are the prices are still a tad high and the food is not _exceptional_.  Also, there are little details like the cumbersome menus and the weirdly-high tables that leave me feeling like the experience wasn't quite worth of five stars.  But I'll be going back now, which is more than I could say before this last visit (I was dragged there... thankfully :)."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch! The bottomless mimosas were very generous and weren't watered down. All items we tried were amazing. The brunch burrito is ridiculously good and so is the cali breakfast sandwich. Super generous portions and great selection of breakfast foods. Very impressed! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"\"Oh my.\" - What we said after every bite. Ask for Trisha - she's maybe as good as the food, maybe better."}
{"text":"One of the most popular places for brunch in the C/U area! They have bottomless mimosas for $12 (with a purchase of an entree). I don't quite remember all the flavors you can choose from but trust me, the list is extensive! I'm also a huge fan of the decor and the general atmosphere. The place is fairly spacious. You also get free popcorn at your table - a pretty fun twist!   I ordered the Bagel & Lox. It has a pretty steep price tag of $15. It was good but definitely not worth $15. I really liked the pickled onions it came with. I also got a side of mixed greens and overall, everything was pretty fresh!   Service was pretty good when I visited! The waitstaff was friendly and we were seated almost immediately."}
{"text":"Decent food. Bloody Mary's are terrible. For the price there are places across the street with much better service and food. The ceiling in this place is terrible nasty. There is dust covering all the vents. It's as easy as getting on a ladder with a vacuum and cleaning them."}
{"text":"I had a reservation for 8 people here for a graduation dinner and it was not a good experience. We got seated pretty quickly but thereafter service was extremely lacking. We waited 20 minutes before anyone acknowledged us and then is was only to bring us water. We stopped one of the hosts asking if we had a waiter and he curtly replied \"I'm working on that.\" No apology, no sense of hospitality. There were also some staff members arranging and rearranging empty tables and place settings and they did so without acknowledging any customers. A few minutes later one of them came to take drink orders and, again, there was no acknowledgement for how long we had been waiting. There was also some mix up with our drinks; one of the servers served two of us our drinks then proceeded to switch them, take them back, and switch them again. This could have easily been avoided by asking \"who had Chardonnay?\" etc.   We eventually had someone come and take our food orders and our experience was relatively issue free after that. There was also a mix up with our bill but, to her credit, our waitress was helpful and understanding in this situation.   I tried to be understanding, this was Mother's Day and graduation weekend, after all. However the restaurant was far from full and there seemed to be more than enough staff so I do not quite understand what the problem was. A gentleman at another table had to get up to find someone to let them know that they were ready to place their order because they hasn't seen their waiter.   Our meal was overall pretty good but I am really disappointed with our experience here and the level of service we received."}
{"text":"I've been to Big Grove Tavern a couple of times over the years. It is always dark and noisy (I'm sorry: \"energetic\"). At first I had had the impression that--being a farm-to-table restaurant--they were interested in hearty, comfort food. So I was surprised on my recent visit to see the menu had expanded to include \"Oceans and Prairies.\" Seafood. In a local restaurant. In East Central Illinois. I was torn between ordering with my values (something local and in season) versus ordering the scallops, which sounded so good. I went with the scallops and was sorry. The shellfish themselves were well cooked, but the rest of the dish was questionable. First of all, the presentation was garish: the scallops were mixed with fennel bulbs and beets on top of a bright green sauce. Salty apple(?) chips had been sprinkled on top. On the sides were a bright yellow sauce I did not like and pieces of blood orange. I had been looking forward to soft fennel and beets, but these were undercooked, in my opinion. Because the food wasn't bad to eat, just not to my taste; I was hungry; and I hate wasting food, I did not send it back. But I did tell my server afterward that I wished the dish had been been straightforward and less fussy.   My date had no complaints about the grilled bistro steak and a nice malbec. The popcorn that night was delicious, and the service was adequate. I suppose we'll go back, but I won't be ordering the seafood again."}
{"text":"Love that I can walk in this restaurant and find items on the menu that the server will be able to tell me exactly which nearby farm the item came from. Delicious farm fresh eggs! We had an extremely attentive and knowledgeable server. Enjoyed our evening here very much."}
{"text":"Great brunch, very affordable lunch, dinner a little overpriced. The popcorn is awesome"}
{"text":"We were in town for the wrestling tournament and were recommended to this newer restaurant. I made a reservation on OpenTable, which was nice. The restaurant is very inviting and rather large.   I love the clean feeling and the hardwood floors. We were seated in the front of the restaurant right near windows for people watching, loved that. There are these cute containers of popcorn on the table. The popcorn is salty, but sweet, nice touch! I checked in on foursquare and got a free deviled egg! The deviled egg was very tasty and different than anything I've ever had.. The egg with the combination of cabbage was tasty!   The beer menu was pretty big, which we liked. Unfortunately, we were told right away that they were out of the bison burger, which is one of the reasons we chose this place, so that was very disapointing.   I ordered the Mac and Cheese and hubby ordered the steak that came with potatoes and veggies, well done. We had a couple rounds of drinks and our food came. My mac and cheese was good, but a bit dry because of the amount of bread crumbs. I feel like the bread crumbs needed to have more butter or moisture. The cheeses and bacon made this macaroni and cheese pretty good. It isn't something I'd order again for $14, but I liked it.   My husbands steak, seemed awfully small for a $20 meal. Probably about 4 oz of meat. Plus, it was cooked more medium than medium well. The sides on the plate were pretty good.   Overall, the place was nice, but a bit overpriced for the portions."}
{"text":"A place worth trying. Had brunch there and the baked potatoes were very good. Gotta visit next time"}
{"text":"I'm not sure whom this stupefying melange of so-so food, so-so service, so-so atmosphere, and bad prices is going for, but it's sure not me!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is that everything on the menu is locally sourced from the veggies to the meats. The bison burger is by far my favorite! What makes it so great is you can taste the freshness of each of the ingredients in every dish. Each option is carefully crafted to display the perfect balance or flavors. The menu options do change due to seasonal availability for veggies/fruit which means there is always something new to try! While the prices are a little bit higher than other sit down places, it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"A bit pricy, but pretty good! We stopped in for a late lunch/early dinner. We enjoyed some of the fresh oyster appetizers. The Big Grove oysters were really unique and were EXCELLENT! They were served with a tasty champagne sauce, seasonal granita, and fresh mint. After the oysters, I had the pork belly tacos for my meal. These were pulled pork tacos served in a corn tortilla with a pineapple salsa. They were pretty good! Everyone in my party enjoyed their meals too! We had a few craft beers and really enjoyed our time here. The atmosphere is modern and clean, and the location is really convenient! If you're in the area, I recommend checking out Big Grove!"}
{"text":"That was probably the best steak fries I have ever had! The juices and the flavor were so intense it was kind blowing. Served with French fries that I did not even have to ask to be well done out the icing on the cake!! The waitress suggested a nice glass of wine that paired perfextly!   Next time I'm in town I'm defiantly coming back!!"}
{"text":"Imaginative & delicious cocktails, food is great, people are Midwestern-friendly & they know their shit. No TV, which is nice. Try it."}
{"text":"Came on a holiday and they were open which was nice. We started with the cheese and meat appetizer, which I suggest you skip for $14. We each got the burgers (old fashion and the hickory) and they were good (not bad, not out of this world, but satisfying). Skip the shaved Brussels sprouts side; they're tasteless and need any kind of seasoning.   Service was average. The waitress forgot the beer but acknowledged it and it was fine; we appreciated that. They staff was friendly and overall the vibe of the place is casual and nice. Prices are reasonable and they have a good selection of food from burgers to sandwiches to salads, steaks, chicken n dumplings and pastas.   They have a generous bar area and ample seating which allows for good group functions or just larger parties for a meal.   One irk: Got a box to go and left the tavern only to realize we forgot it. Ran back in and they had already toss it. Bummer. Wasn't even 5 minutes!   Notable: First sit down dining place we've been to where the food came out before the drinks!"}
{"text":"Big Grove Tavern is pretty much the same food concept as the restaurant across the street (Destihl). The only difference is that Big Grove Tavern is good. I really hate hipsters. Like, some of the stuff that comes out of their mouths actually angers me. So I was not too eager to come to this place thats all \"local, farm to table, blah blah blah.\" Because a lot of times thats a hipster excuse for mediocre tasting food. I dont care if its local or organic or any of that. I just want it to be tasty!! When we walked in I was like... here we go. The OC soundtrack is playing, the menu comes on little clipboards with the farms listed on it, and there is no salt or pepper shakers on any of the tables. It seemed pretentious to me.  But for the most part, everything I tried here was tasty.We had the fried cheesy grits, french fries with malt vinegar aioli, and pickled veggies for an appetizer. I didn't try the vegetables because pickled stuff is not for me. The other two passed the test. For dinner, I ordered the macaroni and cheese. In retrospect I wish I would have ordered the vegetarian version because there was so much bacon in this that it actually took away from the goodness of the cheese. But +1 for it being piping hot. The rest of the family had a pork tenderloin, beef short rib, and burger. I tasted the short rib and the burger- the rib was a little salty but still good. The burger was flavorful but for me (and this is just a personal preference) the mixture of meats made it a little too soft. We did have dessert- Gooey butter cake and a chocolate pot-de-creme. The butter cake fell a little short. I was expecting it to be warm and gooey. It was cold, not gooey, but still rich. The pot-de-creme, was... *kisses fingers like an italian chef* Perfectly bittersweet, rich rich rich, and topped with vanilla whipped cream that I could see the little vanilla speckles in. Nom. Our server was really cool and seemed to genuinely enjoy his job. He kept referring to the chef as \"chef,\" like \"chef makes this, and chef did that\" which was kind of irksome, just because its like... you're in Champaign IL, chef. Come back down to earth a little."}
{"text":"Incredible food, gorgeous setting and excellent service. Micro brew selections are great too.  I travel/dine out a lot and this was great!"}
{"text":"Business lunch was spot on but not outstanding. Super cool environment.  They offer some unique items that are quite good: Fasola (sp?) soup was very good and homey, FYI onions in the top.  I had the special burger which was a chorizo burger with pico, mayo, tomatoes, tortilla chips (although I ordered without the chips they still showed up in the burger) etc on a brioche bun. Very good. The seasonal vegetables were very tasty with a heavy Brussels sprout dose and some spicy chilis. Service was good but waiter seemed to have trouble remembering things and each of our orders came with things we asked to have excluded.  Must see the petrified tree roots above the bar...the restaurant has antique outdoor bulbs strung across the dining room for a outdoor festival feel."}
{"text":"I went here again after being in town.  I tried their special.. a squid ink risotto with clams.  Frankly didn't like it.  Not too much taste and I love squid ink!!!  Oh well...   The wine selection was good though.  The popcorn is probably the best part of the meal.  Oh well..  **************************************************************************** I was more impressed with this place than I thought I would be...  It takes the place of the old steakhouse I used to frequent back in the day when I used to be a college student.  The place has had a face lift.. a bar in the center and tables on the side.  Their concept is farm raised food.  So their menu is really never the same.  Tried a few things.. their cocktail menu was okay.  I tried a strawberry bourbon one was good but then I switched to an old fashioned which was really gross.  Tried their roasted tomato soup which was really way too sour for something like that. Usually it's more sweet after being cooked for so long.. so I am not sure what was going on.  I also tried the trout that the waiter told me was popular.  I wasn't the biggest fan of the cream sauce.  I like the vegetables.. well the farm veggies.  My companion had the filet which looked good but I didn't try it.   Definitely better than Destihl in my opinion.. Champaign downtown is growing up.. still has quite a way to rival major smaller cities."}
{"text":"I went there for Sunday brunch (for the first time) and it's a nice place. There were only about 4 brunch entrees available on the rotating menu, and only 1 jumped out at me as sounding undeniably delicious (I played it safe with eggs, bacon, and potatoes). They didn't even have an omelette, which was very surprising (and a bit disappointing).  Let me say though, the bacon was cooked to perfection. Lots of taste and not too crispy. Potatoes were surprisingly tasty, and the eggs were eggs. Service was impeccable: there are few places that keep up with how much water I drink.  I thought for such a basic dish it was a little pricey at $10, but I must admit that it was really well done.  So my three star comes down to... + flavor + service + bacon powdered popcorn - price - selection"}
{"text":"This is a solid choice for a business lunch. Nice menu selection of traditional American food with prompt service. The outdoor seating area is the best in downtown Champaign and is enjoyable in the summer and fall."}
{"text":"This is our regular brunch spot.  Best outdoor seating in downtown Champaign.  I like their extensive brunch menu more than their regular lunch or dinner menus.  Nearly everything is locally sourced.  Consistent, outstanding, southwest inspired dishes and midwest comfort foods, great drinks, and smart, attentive staff.  Coffee flavored popcorn at starter at every table is a nice bonus.  Make a reservation to get priority outdoor seating."}
{"text":"We had dinner reservations for our daughters U of I graduations and I'll start by saying our party was seated at a great table.  The evening of great service began with Trisha and she carried it thru until the end.  She had great advice on appetizers and what entries would accommodate some of our vegetarian guests. It was so relaxing to have someone offering such great advice and care to our family. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Thank god for this place. That's really all I can say. Well no, I can say more. But before I get to the meat of my review, no pun intended, let me say that Big Grove Tavern is exactly what this town needed. When Jim Gould's closed I was sad to see it go but what has come in it's place is something really fantastic. From the food to the interior to the crowd, the energy Big Grove gives off is infectious and demonstrates that the confluence of intellect and small-town charm in Champaign can really lead to something amazing.  Now on to the food:  Popcorn: Come for free as a starter. While I was hoping for bread, I was even happier with this. The popcorn really whets your appetite without being too filling. I hear the flavor changes; it was definitely some kind of lime (think the hint of lime you find certain Mexican foods) flavor when I was there.  Tavern Burger: There are so many things I can say about the Tavern Burger. First and most simply, it's delicious. The blend of bison was for me, the most prominent of the three meats that make up the burger but overall I found it to be rich, meaty and just the right amount of gamey given the bison. The onion marmalade, and petite crusty bun complimented the burger without overpowering the taste of the meat. I opted to add the fried egg which led to messy experience given the soft yolk, but a certainly more delicious one. At this point, if I did this right, you are so convinced about the deliciousness of the burger you won't even care to hear about the fries. But hey, if you're still interested: they're completely well-executed- crisp yet still potatoey.   Now... onto my other comment on the Tavern Burger. There was some review on here about how the burger is in limited quantities. That's how you know it's fresh and locally sourced! If I wanted something from a freezer I'd head down by the mall and swallow some hormone-laced, bacon-cheese-blue cheese-fried onion-black forest-ham-ranch dressing-heart attack in a bun. If you want a burger that satisfies your burger craving while still being an appreciable entree and cut of meat, come enjoy the Tavern Burger. And if you've missed it, just come back and try again! And frankly, at 12 bucks, it's not that bad. The downtown Champaign restaurant scene generally errs on the more expensive side. Given what Jim Gould's prices used to be like, Big Grove is far more reasonable price-wise in comparison.    In sum, ignore the hate, embrace the love, Big Grove will have you leaving full, happy and pleasantly surprised by what Champaign has to offer food-wise."}
{"text":"Coming from CA I have pretty high standards when a restaurant states they are a farm to table. Big Grove didn't disappoint. Dinner menu was small but had a nice variety. The roasted beets were phenomenal. Looking forward to trying Sunday brunch here in the future."}
{"text":"Everything about Big Grove is amazing. Very unique environment with a great craft beer selection. The staff is very nice and polite. Saving the best for last, THE FOOD! 6 stars"}
{"text":"Amazing food, incredible service, out of this world music, and the greatest atmosphere of any restaurant in champaign. Take advantage of the $8 unlimited mimosa bar, and make sure to request Zach as your server!"}
{"text":"I came just to have a glass of wine. I knew they had a good selection and I was looking for a rosé. Grant the bartender was awesome, he quickly told me the different rosés he had. Set me up with a nice little popcorn appetizer which had \"olbei\"? As a spice. Fantastic little sampler. Grant was a cool guy and was very knowledgeable about all their drinks and spirits. Would definitely recommend coming for a drink. No reference on food yet. Will be back."}
{"text":"We visited last weekend (Sunday night 5/14) after a graduation ceremony at U.I.  Our party of 8 got seated right away, just before our reservation time of 8:00.  The attention at the beginning was spot on.  Emiko was our server and she got the drink order in right away and got the rest of the order taken in a timely manner.    As far as the food goes, our party had a variety of things on the menu from burgers to pasta to steak and I think the consensus was it was about average.  Nothing really stood out as amazing to eat.  One of the steaks was ordered med-well and came out med-rare but it wasn't a huge thing.  Those things can happen anywhere and it was dealt with as quick as possible.  I saw some of the same things that other people have posted in their reviews when it comes to the service.  Our server kind of disappeared after the main course came out and it just seemed like our table got put on the backburner for awhile.  She eventually did get back to fill drinks and check in, and actually apologized for the delay since they were 'short staffed'.  That very well could have been the case but if so then I put the blame more on management rather than our server.  Short staffed on the Sunday of the local college graduation?  Seriously?    Overall we had a nice celebration dinner and it turned out ok.  Nothing spectacular for the price, and hopefully the issues Big Grove is having with the management & training side of things get worked out sooner rather than later, as there are many of other options in Champaign/Urbana for a higher end dinner."}
{"text":"Where to begin? I will bullet point this for clarity: *Poor kids menu *Over confidently pretentious ambience without a menu or service to back it up *Told waitress the burger comprised of bison, beef, pork was not to husbands liking and  1. She never apologized and offered to replace it.  2. A manager was never sent to the table.  3. Our bill was delivered and the food item was not removed.  *Pricey for even high end bar food in Chicago suburbs none the less a college town.  Our family of 4 left hungry, cold in the damp April rain, and wishing we had went back across the street to Guidos. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Big Grove Tavern is a SUPER addition to the Champaign food landscape. From the first step inside the door, I love the atmosphere that is set by the hanging string lights, twisted wood light fixtures, and basic (but neat) hanging 2x4's. The food is fantastic, and as much as possible locally sourced. I love the Big Grove burger with fried egg on top, as well as the mac and cheese and tater tots appetizer. Because of the local aspect of the ingredients, expect to pay $2-3 more than you would at a local chain, but the improved atmosphere and deliciousness definitely make it worth it!"}
{"text":"I was really close to leaving a 3 star review, but Big Grove pulled through in the end!  My folks came down to visit and we wanted to grab some dinner.   We got in at 4:30 and the server informed us we couldn't order dinner until 5, so we got a table and dissected the menu for ~30 minutes, ordered some drinks, and a bar snack or two.  We opted to sit outside on a beautiful Sunday evening. Though I must mention the inside of Big Grove has a cool ambiance. Very dark/modern types of colors with some interesting tree/woodwork stuff hanging from the ceiling.  Wine by the glass happened to be half off that evening, which was a pleasant surprise. I had a smoother French one which I forget the name of and my mother had a French Malbec, I tried to look them up online when I got home but it seems their wine list isn't 100% up to date online. Dad opted for a beer, the Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro, which ironically my roommate just ordered last weekend at Black Dog! He really enjoyed it but thought it wasn't served cold enough. No frosty glass, kind of a turn off for my Pops....  We started with the deviled eggs and hushpuppies. The eggs were just OK and I thought the hush puppies were pretty tasty, especially with the sauce they came with! My mother said they were just fair.  For dinner, my Uncle got the Free-Range chicken which he liked a lot. He particularly enjoyed the chicken jus as well as the dumplings that came with it. Mom and Dad split the short ribs, which they both thought were exceptional, and believe me, my mother is highly critical of short ribs, since she can cook up some mighty fine ones herself. I can verify via taste that these were not your average short ribs, I'd highly recommend these. On a last second split decision between the skirt steak and the pork tenderloin, I opted for the latter. This was also a really well put together dish that came with carrots, endive, and these glorious sweet potato hash brown patty things. The pork itself was done a perfect medium-rare and was flavorful, juicy and overall a nicely executed plate that would not have been the same without the creamy mustard sauce it was all sitting on.  We did have some qualms which would have normally warranted only a 3 star review if it wasn't for how well everyone enjoyed their entrees. The beer I mentioned above could definitely have been served colder. Our server didn't seem to take the hint when my dad mentioned he liked frosty glasses. Our other major qualm would be the price to portion ratio. My parents split the short ribs and when they were finished they were still kind of hungry. Be warned, if you want to be at least a little full, don't share an entrée, the portions are pretty small. The place is also comparably expensive, all of these entrees nearly required a $20 bill or more. We thought the clipboard menus were a little tacky for a place of this caliber.  I do like the farm-to-table concept, I also really admire and respect Big Grove's local sourcing of foods. My only constructive criticism would be to actually put where each dish comes from on the menu, such as:  \"Grilled Pork Tenderloin - Farm XYZ: _____, IL\".  As an avid organic and local food fan, adding this type of notation makes me feel much better than simply, \"local\". Common Ground Co-Op in Urbana does a fairly good job of  this.  Overall, a very pleasant dinner on a gorgeous day."}
{"text":"I went here with my parents one night.  I love downtown Champaign, there are plenty of interesting and very good restaurants around.  Not to mention lots of very good beer bars.  This place tries to combine the two with a small but well constructed tap list and a small locally sourced menu.  My parents have been here a few times, and warned me of the downfalls (slow service, running out of menu items).  Well, I always have to check a new place out and see for myself.  After our visit, I had to apologize and thank them for humoring me.  Anyway, a large open room with an island bar.  The light fixtures look like Christmas lights bought at Farm & Fleet.  The sticks on the ceiling look like they were bought at Hobby Lobby.  We were seated right away, which was a good sign.  Though besides the fancy popcorn we were ignored for a long time.  I hate to be the person to say service was slow, cause it was a busy night.  I can deal with slow, but no acknowledgement what so ever was not good.  Incredibly slow kitchen times as well.  We finally put our drink and food orders in at the same time.  We were not sure when we would get another chance.  I liked their beer selection.  8 taps of good micros.  Though they were out of four taps.  Half of their selection was out.  I like it when a place can go through kegs and rotate the selection, though no.  They would rather just not have half the selection.  Out of Great Lakes, out of Founders, out of Dark Horse, out of Victory.  I ended up with a Sculpin, and my Dad a Goose Island 312.  If you are going to have a small selection, you need to keep it stocked.  The menu was similarly small, but looked good.  My Dad ended up with the last burger, which is a mix of beef, bison, and pork.  Sounds great.  He has tried to eat here before, twice actually.  Both times out of the burger, so it was good that he finally got to try it.   Again, it is good that they can go through the menu like that.  Though it is tiring when they keep running out.  I had the pork sausage, my Mom Mac & Cheese.  It is a tiny menu for dinner, about 5 main courses.  I love when a place can do that.  Just not enough here to pull that off.  Especially when they run out of stuff.   On top of that, not much here was that great.  The burger was decent, Mac & Cheese cold, and the sausage was poorly executed with little flavor.  They shout from every corner that everything is fresh and local.  Fine, but make it good.  This is one of my longest reviews, and I guess it is this way because I had very high hopes and little was as expected.  Though I was told before hand that everything was slow, over priced, pretentious, not that good, and often out.  This place just left me wanting so much more."}
{"text":"It at times gets very busy and I think a little too hard for the staff to manage.  The food is good, nothing out of the ordinary.   It is certainly on the pricey side!"}
{"text":"Big Grove can be the best restaurant downtown depending on the day.  They are always the best option for brunch. This can be attributed to the best Bloody Mary in town which is served with a stout or porter 'back'.   The menu always provides interesting choices and is a good length. You have enough choice without having too much choice. A visit is not complete without at least one deviled egg. Aside from the Bloody Mary, they have the most interesting drink list no matter the season.   The atmosphere and decor make for an experience that feels upscale without being overly stuffy. When the weather is nice there is no better outdoor seating in downtown.  The only thing that keeps this restaurant from five stars is the service (aside from one or two servers) is not up to the quality of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful!! The moment I walked in they were playing Motown!!! Lovely windows to to see the downtown! My waitress was wonderful and helped me explore the menu as it was my first time!!! The beets with crime friache and PICKLED ONIONS are to die for !!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I now visit at least, once a week.  The dishes are excellently prepared, plated and served.  The flavours to everything from the Appetizers to the Main Courses to the Dessert continue to impress.  I have too many favorites to enumerate, but I'd recommend Big Grove Tavern to anyone who loves food.  All local, always fresh.  The Tuesday fried chicken & waffles are amazing.  I have only tried the brunch once, but it was delicious and my whole family had a great time.  Loved the bloody mary's too.    The staff are incredible, possibly the best in town.  The servers know what they are doing and they do with elan, charm and a ready smile.  And everyone cares so deeply that the guests are having a great time.  Lastly, I have been hanging out at Big Grove's beautiful bar (and I have learned that even the bar is \"local\" made by a local artisan) and it is becoming a truly cool after work watering hole.  One word of advice, if you are planning on a Friday or Saturday dinner visit, you probably would be wise to make a reservation(which I did from their website via Opentable.com).  Easy to do.   Try it.  You'll love it too."}
{"text":"I stayed across the street on a recent trip and needed to grab a quick lunch.  I sat at the bar so service was fast.  The drinks were good and my sandwich was average.  The interior was nice though and I liked the popcorn they gave me while I waited for my meal."}
{"text":"I went there with some people for work, on a Wednesday afternoon, the wait for the food was really long, although not even 1/2 of the restaurant was filled. I ordered their specialty burger, because all the pics on their Facebook page look amazing and well, I was unfortunately disappointing. It was quite plain, the meat patty was 1/2 of the size of the bun, way overcooked, didn't even ask how i would like it done !?!?!?! Will not go back. there are better choices right across the street. Try Desthil, even Guidos was bette, go wild and go for BBQ at the Black Dog. Dont waste your time. money and hunger on this place."}
{"text":"This place definitely had a sophisticated feel to it. I definitely was disappointed by the long amount of time it took for us to even get service. However, the bartender was at least friendly and the popcorn was fairly good, if not a little stale.   I ordered a Tavern Burger which cost $12. The burger was alright; I always feel a bit jipped when a restaurant burger doesn't include tomatoes in it. It didn't help that they couldn't make two alcoholic beverages that my friend and I asked for. All in all, the hike up in the prices is paying for the atmosphere for the establishment."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday Friday.  We have tried to get in several times in the past without success so this time We made reservations but still ended up having to wait about fifteen minutes.  Service was horrible.  It took forever for someone to show up at the table just to tell us she would be with us shortly and I'm still not even sure who our actual server was because she never came back.  Three different people came to the table repeatedly checking on if they had the order correct.  The gentleman who took our order did our drinks appetizer and entrees all at once which made us feel like they couldn't wait for us to leave.  The glasses they served our water in were dirty, neither one of us drank ours.  The food was good, I had the pot roast and my husband had a burger not worth the terrible service we experienced though.  They don't have a ton of options and it is quite pricey.  The least they could do would be to offer some free bread or something!! Don't understand the hype and will not be back!"}
{"text":"Am here for business and *really* want to give this place a good review, because the food actually is, for the most part, very flavorful.   I had the falafel, which was a tad dry, but it's falafel, and this is easy to screw up - forgivable.    The other dishes were great.  Excellent turkey sandwich, though the sourdough is a bit airy for my tastes.  A traditional sourdough needs some ... sourness and doughiness - this really does taste like airy French or Italian bread.   The saged popcorn is a nice touch, but I have been here about seven times, and it is always saged popcorn, and the server consistently says   \"Our popcorn -today- is fried sage\". ... which to me implies that this will change once in a while.  In my experience, it does not.   Finally, and this has been said *dozens* of times here.  The prices are completely out of line with Champaign.  I can get locally sourced ingredients to create a Turkey sandwich and mixed green salad at the local grocery, and a 10oz bottle of the same beer.  Grand total will be well under $20 with a full six pack and ingredients to spare.   My damage for lunch?  $23 after a modest tip.  The following day I had a (good) soup of Yellow Beet root and mixed green salad.  To be clear, we are talking about a CUP of soup and a small plate of salad, for $18.   Completely out of touch with the local area and absolutely haranguing customers on the guise of farm-to-table.  Want to like it based on the food, can't stand to be here based on the price.  If you're willing to literally incinerate your money, hop on in."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining here. We ate outside. I like the ambiance and the service was fast. I ordered the spinach salad which was good and the free range chicken dinner. The chicken and au jus were delicious but the vegetables and dumplings were bland. The green beans were tough. For the price that disappointed me. My sister ordered the salmon. She said it was good but too raw even when ordered at medium."}
{"text":"Went in with my daughter Friday night around 8. They seemed reluctant to seat us at a table for four but after 5 minutes they did. We ordered soft drinks, my daughter's had a weird taste so they replaced it with a different one. My daughter's appetizer came after our meal, our waitress apologized but no offer of taking it off of the bill or comping our drinks. The tavern burger wasn't anything special, my daughter had the skirt steak was good. I wouldn't go back, there are plenty of places nearby to try when we visit next."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on 2/8/18, prior then the Illini basketball game. We drove in from Bloomington, Indiana and were looking for a place to grab a nice meal after our drive. We really enjoyed our time here, and our waiter was fantastic! He was helpful and attentive and made sure we got our on time to make it to the game!   We started with the hummus platter. It has quite the cilantro flavor, so if you're not a big fan of cilantro (like me) you may want to pass on this. Even though I didn't like the hummus, my wife loved the flavor, and the waiter even offered to bring me something else when he saw that I didn't like it (I declined).   For our entrees, my wife got the burger on special. It was called the nacho, and she really enjoyed it. I got a grilled chicken sandwich with avocado and it was also excellent. We also had a couple of cocktails and they were reasonably priced and quite good!"}
{"text":"I've visited Big Grove twice for food and a couple other times for drinks and other events. This is a medium fancy joint which would impress even the most arrogant Tinder date. The aesthetic gives off a clean woodland vibe, with twinkling lights and an open floor plan. Noise level will never rise above a low din unlike it's prices. Brunch, Poutine on special, ran be about $15 and left me a few bucks for a sampling of stout. The poutine was average, poached eggs cracked above a plane of their fries. I enjoyed the fries and vinegar more than the eggs but they did manage to convince me that gravy is not completely disgusting and unnecessary. And for that feat alone they deserve 3 stars. I'll probably wander back in this place eventually but it's not one of my top ten for food or drinks. I would even think of it as the hipster sister of Destihl of similar renown (I say sister since no man would have the need for 3oz beers)."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Tasty popcorn to snack on while you wait for food, an awesome selection of beverages (wine, liquor, beer), and they try to source as much of their food locally as possible (check out the map of where everything comes from on the wall). The food is way beyond tavern food; expect to be surprised."}
{"text":"Went to Big Grove Tavern for the first time.  Granted it was on graduation night for U of I so it was packed and with a \"special\" menu. But you would expect excellent quality and service on such a night.   Well we did not receive either.  The salad ordered was to have bib lettuce and came with ice burg lettuce.  When we said something to the waitress her comment was that she didn't let us know when ordering because no one had noticed yet.  Someone needs to tell her that 9 out of 10 people won't say anything.  They just leave. Disappointed.  Also ordered a bottle of wine that was not available with the correct date.  Food was good but not $30 entree good.  Had to ask for salt and pepper and actually shared the pepper mill with another table.   Quite unusual. There are a lot of dining options in and around the area.  Do yourself a favor and find another location that offers a better value."}
{"text":"Great place to come for brunch... In fact, it's the only times I've been there.  Love the food, love the space, definitely somewhere I enjoy going to.  I think the food is a bit pricey though for what it is but you're paying for the ambiance and quality."}
{"text":"Came here last night with some pretty important company and had a wonderful time! Thanks Big Grove Tavern! I think the key is the seasonality of this place. With it being late spring right now, there are all kinds of delicious vegetables to work with. I highly recommend the pate if you're into pate, this is one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"I loved this place when it first opened.  Just went in and was informed it was shift change and the server seemed to rushed to care. I know how it is working in food service, but we didnt feel welcome.  Desthil wins again, also with better hours"}
{"text":"I'm so confused how this place has stayed open or why people continue to come here. The deviled egg was inedible. The pretzel came with a 'honey mustard' where the main ingredient wad horseradish. The steak was terrible quality and chewy and not prepared as requested and the sides were bitter. I came here for their awesome dessert menu and after trying the food,  I was too afraid to order one.  There are a lot of good restaurants in champaign urbana. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"I was there recently with a friend..and loved the chicken dinner cooked with herbs.  Everything there is so fresh, and the flavorings and spices are added just right.   I really enjoyed the atmosphere.   I was just a bit disappointed that the prices are high.  I do wish they had some lower priced entrees.   I really like the emphasis on local, and the food was good quality."}
{"text":"I've been to Big Grove Taver for brunch and dinner before. If I'm not mistaken they have 3 different menu for brunch, lunch, and dinner. This place takes both reservation and walk-ins, which was very helpful during graduation weekend when all the restaurants are packed.  First impression: the place is trendy - you can sit in the bar area, tables, booth, or even outside during the summer. During brunch people come in their sweatshirt and sweatpants, but the dinner crowd is more well-dressed. I had a good experience with the service everytime I go to this place. They serve you popcorn with spices of the day as a complementary snack.  Dinner: I came here with my vegetarian friend so all the items we ordered from the menu is vegetarian! - Devilled eggs: delicious, but not dying for it - Chilled roasted beets: very very delicious - I honestly prefer the beets to the devilled eggs for appetizer - Roasted sunchoke risotto: Errr... It's just ok. I've had better risotto before. I think it's a little bland - Veggie mac and cheese: Also just ok.   Among all 4 items we order, I like the beets the most!  Brunch: To be fair, I've been ordering the same thing over and over again: CHILAQUILES. My mouth is literally watering as I am writing this. It is absolutely heavenly!!! The tortilla is well covered in spices and it is between crunchy and soft corn tortillas. The shredded chicken is so soft and it melts in my mouth! MUST TRY! The portion is very generous I usually can't finish the whole plate in one meal.  My boyfriend had the eggs benedict before and he said it was good, but it's something you can find anywhere!  Did I mention they have good selection of cocktails? LOVE THE BLOODY MARY!!   Overall I give 3 stars for the dinner and 5 for the brunch and thus 4 stars!! It's also a good place to chill and drink on sat/ Friday night."}
{"text":"Nice beer selection.  Split roasted chicken with herb dumplings was exceptional. Nice atmosphere for a college town restaurant. Quality service, ambiance and ingredients.  Definitely will revisit when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Everything But the Bun!  Everything at this restaurant was excellent - except the hamburger bun.  I enjoyed the open space, the furnishings, the art on the walls, the overall feel of the place.  The staff was excellent - friendly, helpful with menu selections, and accommodating.   The menu itself is charming - and the attention to the farm-to-table detail is commendable. There's seasoned popcorn on the table - a nice touch.   I tried the very economical \"If It's From The Vine It's Fine\" daily wine special, which was quite a brilliant surprise for the price. I would recommend this to anyone.   The take on a wedge salad - using bibb lettuce - was inspired. I was surprised there was no bread served with the salad. And, while I realize this is the chef's preference, I wanted some to sop up a little of the salad's very tasty creamy herb vinaigrette. And so I asked for some bread. And received some lovely bread to accompany the salad.   For a main I ordered the Tavern Burger - a monster of beef, bison & pork, red onion marmalade, cornichon aioli - and served with house-cut fries. The fries were great! A bit less greasy version of those fantastic greasy kind of fries you get from a hot dog stand. Super good. As was the burger - the marmalade - and the cornichon aioli. Everything was perfect except...the bun! - Which was so bland and tough and flavorless, I tossed it to the side and knife and forked the burger.  I'm sure, if I brought this detail to the staffs attention, they would have somehow taken care of things - they were nice that way. So I can only fault myself for not making an issue of it then. But man - compared to everything else - that was so great - that bun was a letdown. Regardless, I highly recommend Big Grove Tavern."}
{"text":"I ate at Big Grove by myself during my visit to Champaign. The ambiance was relaxing, laid back and good vibes. I would highly recommend the Mac and cheese with the honey cornbread. Good combo of a sweet and salty taste and quite filling. The service was awesome and I was constantly checked on to make sure I had everything I needed. I loved it so much and went back for brunch over the weekend. It was so good I ate it ALL. Usually I leave something but this was too good to pass up."}
{"text":"Best meal I have eaten in 2018. The chicken melts in your mouth which defies the hydrophobic interaction of the amino peptide bonds in the sarcomere fibers, yet I really don't care. 10 out of 10 would recommend. Everything about this restaurant is perfect. They give you popcorn instead of cheap old bread. That popcorn, yeah it's delicious. Highly recommend the cake too."}
{"text":"Really unique craft food. One of the best brunches downtown Champaign for sure, plus endless mimosas. Good drink selection too. I also leave and think about the server with greenish hair and glasses a weird amount afterwards. I just can't describe it."}
{"text":"Complimentary popcorn greets you upon being seated. Not just ordinary popcorn...today was bacon-coffee. Others are: sage, old bay, brown butter...  Farm to table   You'll be ruined from eating any bagged greens...Greens today from Blue Moon Farm (my server mentioned that he worked there for three years) - they sell also at Urbana Farmer's Market.  Coffee is a special blend created for Big Grove from the Columbia Roastery (down the road.)   Paprika hollandaise was too mild for my taste but a pinch of salt and pepper (fresh ground), perked it right up. The house-made English muffins are dense and doughy and I'd like to take home a dozen! Or maybe only six, since they're at least twice the size of store-bought.   The dining space is swag-bulb lit, wood floor, with accents of naked branches over the bar.   Music is light and sometimes acoustic only - soothing harp sounds were the perfect touch for a few leisurely moments at brunch. Chill yet vibrant somehow...  Babies don't cry in here! (Well, at least not the adorable 10 mo old next to me. Maybe I just have that effect.)  Nice outdoor patio - even open in October (not that I spotted a heat lamp.)  They don't offer the popcorn for sale, but who knows when an awesome server might offer you some to go.   Happy in the Big Grove....& from their website: \"Our name comes from a large stand of trees called, \"The Big Grove,\" which offered shelter from the wide open prairie skies during the earliest days of our community. Now known as Busey Woods, you can still see the remnant of Big Grove in Urbana today.\""}
{"text":"This place was really great. Nice decor, friendly and attentive service that was not overbearing. We didn't feel rushed despite coming close to closing time, and the outdoor patio was lively but not loud.   Everything on the menu sounded delicious, and all the dishes we had were, in fact, delicious. They also came out fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Big Grove used to be a pretty reliable 4 star meal, not outstanding, but never disappointing either. Last couple of times my girlfriend and I have been though we've been very underwhelmed. Last night was probably our final meal there.  We ordered a round of appetizers, all good and the only high point of the night. When our entrees came our table was full of empty plates to the point that there was nowhere to put the food, but the server just kind of looked at us expectedly and then said \"this plate is really hot\" (more on this in a second), so the three of us each took a plate in our hand to clear the table while she set our entrees down, and then she took our plates without another word.   The kicker though is that the plate she indicated was hot was in no way warm, and the steak that was on it was somewhere between lukewarm and cold. I always hate the concept of sending a steak back to the kitchen to be cooked more or reheated but I was going to do so, that's how cool the steak was. But sadly no one ever came by again to check on us, so I ate the half of my steak that was warm enough to cut with my butter knife and called it a night. My girlfriend's entree, the ricotta gnocchi with duck confit, was equally disappointing, but moreso because it was just not a good dish than anything having to do with preparation. It was super bland with no real dominant flavor, there was no evidence of ricotta anywhere inside the gnocchi or anywhere else in the dish, and the duck confit tasted and looked literally nothing like duck, to the point that even after the manager assured me it was I still don't believe him.  To be fair, it was a busy Saturday night, and they ended up comping 50% of the bill after we complained. But all in all there are countless places in Champaign serving better food and trying much harder to deliver good experiences, so I don't see much of a reason to give them a third chance."}
{"text":"Wine selection is top-notch.  They Schooner by Caymus.  ;)  Our party of five only had wine and beer on tap.  The menu isn't exactly cohesive; it is eclectic.  It's a bummer they don't offer fresh oysters except on weekends.    Must-haves are the crab cakes.  The soup-of-the-week was also really good.  My friend had ordered the chicken tortilla but received the chicken gumbo instead.  So lucky me...I was able to try it chocked full of okra. I had the patty melt (minus thousand island) w/ fries.  While, I really wanted the old-school Tavern burger, the waitress was thoroughly confused by my request.  I just said I wanted a cheeseburger with red onion marmalade.  That's it.  But I'm not complaining because the patty melt was pretty good too.  same same but different.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals overall.  No complaints over the fresh catch (halibut), adobo chicken and dumplings, and shrimp & grits.  Just ok... - fried brussel sprouts - homestyle chicken and dumplings"}
{"text":"So, it seems kridz is just humoring me now.   Do you want to go to dinner before going to play pool tonight? I asked.   Sure, she said.  Where do you want to go? I asked.   I dunno, she said.   Big Grove, Miga, Wedge??? I asked.   Dunno, she said. Does, Big Grove have their menu online.   Yes, I said. They have... mac and cheese, and on the kids menu, a grilled cheese.   Sounds good, she said. I'll probably get the grilled cheese.  So we go there, about 6 pm. No wait, we are seated by a combination of Trish and Katie Flynn. Neither of which are our waitress. Ash is working the bar. Maria is bussing and doing the best job bussing that anyone in Champaign has ever done, because Maria is awesome.   We are brought out waters and the tin of popcorn. I order a beer, Triptych Empire of Dirt (would you like a taster? a serving? or YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL, MY EMPIRE OF DIRT!!!) (they didn't ask that, it's my line from when it was on at the brewery)  Kridz says she isn't hungry. I'm wondering why the heck we came here, or that she joined me if she isn't hungry, this place is a nice sit down place, and she's got to run to go to pool. If she was hungry, she would have ordered the pork tenderloin. Instead she got a salad. I got the pork tenderloin.   The tenderloin was delicious. I have no idea what the other things on the plate with it were. I just looked up their menu online, and pork tenderloin isn't listed. I don't think the salad she had is listed either. Well this is awkward. (almost as awkward as spelling/reading the word awkward) (so many parenthesis) (parenthesis also looks awkward)  How to describe the things on the plate? Well, there was grilled lemon slices, I chose to forego eating them. There was (possibly) leeks. Which kridz asked what that was, and i'm like... uh.. it's kind of like a really big onion green part. And there was a really nice sauce that seemed to be a little mustard-y, kind of grey poupon-ish, but better. The weirdest things were these little cubes of things that I have no idea what they were. They looked like potatoes, but I don't think so. They were crunchy, but not crispy. They were hard to stab with a fork, but not tough. They were really tasty, and seemed sort of potato-ish, but I have no idea what they were (again, I was gonna look it up, but that items not on the online menu). The tenderloin was a lot pinker that kridz would ever eat, so I gave her a sliver from the side that was more done. I informed her that there was salt on the top of it, and those were not ice crystals.   Kridz got a salad, that had walnuts and some other things.   Prior to eating, we got 2 deviled eggs. To me, they were great, they weren't the things for her.   I had a great dinner.   Got done eating and as we were leaving talked to Katie, she will be performing at the Great Cover Up. I asked what she was doing (no act will tell you what they are doing) and she replied *****. Which made me laugh heartily. I mentioned that with a 15 minute set, what's she going to do, 1/2 a ***** song. She chuckled, then we both pondered... does ***** have any words?  Dear lord, I hope she's not really doing a ***** set, and I just ruined the surprise for everyone. (I removed the band name, just in case she's actually doing *****)  Big Grove is a great date place. It's dark. They have fancy things. You can feel like you are impressing your date. Even when they only order the salad, eat half of it, and pick out the walnuts because that's really the only part that they want.   If you are only going to eat salad, I said, why did you say to come here?  I know you wanted to go someplace where you could give a new review, she said."}
{"text":"Great service but the times I've gone have been hit or miss. The mimosas are a hit for brunch since they refill them very often (so don't drive lol)! But the pancake and bacon breakfasts have been a meh. I liked their bison burger (very hearty) and for dinner I've had the chicken pot pie (this was sooo tasty!). I appreciate the popcorn that they give you in the beginning of the meal. I wish they had a few more brunch options that were a tad heartier (girls gotta eat) but it's been okay!"}
{"text":"I don't see what all the hype is about. It was overpriced and very salty!! This is the first time I've ever complained that a meal was too salty."}
{"text":"First time here, had heard many good things but was presented with poor service and poor food quality for price.  Asked for items we did not get. Were enjoying ourselves until we had multiple rude encounters with our waitress. Waitress talked back to us instead of getting a manager after we had asked-as a former waitress that is something you should never do. Manager was pleasant and handled the situation well but it was too far gone after the behavior of our waitress. Only will give it 1 more chance."}
{"text":"Went for a dinner meeting.  Family style serving was awkwardly carried out - the food coming in random order.  Absolutely no seasoning on anything left the entire meal bland and uninteresting.  The exception being two overly sweet sauces that did not really enhance the food and seemed out of place.  Not a salt or pepper shaker in sight, platters put down with no serving utensils and scarce wait staff.  The entire service disrupted concentrating on the speaker.  Several commented they felt hungry afterwards because the food lacked flavor.  Also, the drinks menu is too eclectic.  Not everyone is interested in craft beers and the mixed drink options were very limited."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!! I went here with my girls and it was amazing! Ask for Leah she is the best waitress!! Love her!"}
{"text":"Stopped after graduation without reservations and was seated immediately at 4pm. Food was very good all the way around. Moscow mule also excellent. I had the risotto and it was presented with an excellent blend of creamy, crunchy crab cake(1) only one small crab cake in a 24.00 dish Now that my daughter has graduated, wont be back  ."}
{"text":"If I could give this place ZERO STARS, I would. This place has terrible customer service from the wait staff all the way to the general manger. I have eaten at this restaurants about 4-5 times. Every time I come there is something messed up with the order. I continued to come because I enjoyed the vibe of the place, as well as the bottomless mimosa. When I respectfully informed the waiter of the messed up order (no meat in my food, when I requested extra steak) she proceeded to tell me not to return to the establishment if the food was not to my liking. Who talks to customers like that? STAFF VERY RUDE & FOOD IS MEDIOCRE. I don't not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Restaurant review I recently visited this restaurant with a friend that came from out of town. The server was friendly and gave us plenty of time to order. While you wait you get complimentary popcorn with seasoning. Although it is good, I can't say I would fall head over heels for this. I ended up getting the sea scallops. Although I think they were fresh, the mixture of ingredients including blood orange and fennel puree was okay, but on the salty side. The highlight of the meal was the bread pudding that came out piping hot and was the perfect blend of chocolate and vanilla cream. If you like farm to table this is your restaurant, but I think the food is okay and still does not reach to the level of some of the fancier restaurants in chicago  Pros: farm to table food, friendly server, large beer selection, free parking validation  Cons: The food is okay, not superb  Hidden deals: Monday Night- Date Night $50 for two people four course Prix Fixe menu  Tuesday night- fried chicken and waffles $17 Wednesday Night- \"Five for $5\" Cocktail Specials Thursday Happy Hour- $1 off 16oz Draft Beers Friday Lunch- Fish Sandwich Special 10.99 Friday & Saturday Poutine after 9:00pm Sunday Night - 1/2 off Wine by the Glass  Health code rating: B. Clean restaurant, food appears to be prepared well. http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=1820"}
{"text":"The first 2 times I had gone here years ago it made be never return. Recently I have been a dozen times or more and it is amazing! Amazing food and amazing service. Their drinks and bartenders are fantastic. The food is a bit on the salty side for my liking but amazing none the less."}
{"text":"Pretty good meal - kids loved the burger with a fried egg.  Fries went well with the burger.  IMO, some local dishes leave me wanting a little more flavor.  I'll say three and a half - call it four."}
{"text":"Best brunch place!  Love the atmosphere!  The food is delicious and the unlimited mimosas for $10 cannot be beat!  Got the maple doughnut yesterday as they were out of cinnamon rolls...yummy!  Eggs Benedict, delish!  Everything we've had there has been awesome."}
{"text":"Overpriced and slow. The servers try their best and generally have good attitudes but it takes forever. The food seems to be priced based on how many hipster adjectives they can add instead of actual quality of the meal. Flavored popcorn is a fun gimmick when we're drinking but not enough to bring me back. Too bad because the location is excellent."}
{"text":"Solid. For sure.  First of all, the decor is great. The place is open, airy, and has this beautiful ceiling with old branches. It's very modern but still cozy. I loved it. It totally went with their idea that food should be natural and local, it fit.  Our drinks were pretty great. I had the Frasca and my boyfriend had a bourbon drink and both were great. The wine list is kind of sweet too.  Then of course, the food! I had the steak which was really really great, especially rare, yum! The potatoes were creamy and everything was just super tasty. My boyfriend absolutely loved his pork tenderloin. The friends we were with had the steak and chicken and loved it too. The portions were also great, I was stuffed when I was done! Next time though, I definitely want to try the appetizers and small plates. Let me also just say that  our server was awesome. Everyone there is super nice and I have a friend that works there. It's just a great crew!  After dinner, we had a couple of coffee drinks (with some special stuff in it) and it was a perfect end to a really nice meal. Basically, I'm giving this place four stars because I finally don't have to keep going to Bacaro or Radio Maria for a really nice meal in this town. After being a townie and moving to Chicago, I've come to realize that it's about time that  we get more places like this in Champaign!"}
{"text":"Sometimes the food is great, and sometimes it's so-so. I've never had in-between. But whether great or just ok, it's still never worth the price.   The cocktails are very good, though. That's actually my favorite part of their menu."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and had a good experience. Truffle-flavored popcorn was a pleasant surprise. I had chicken tortilla soup which was good but cup portion is small. I got large Caesar salad which was good as well. Glad I didn't get small salad! Service was good but restaurant was not very busy on Monday. Rhubarb \"hand pie\" was like a turnover and very good. Any Illini alum who has not been downtown Champaign will be surprised at how area has improved!"}
{"text":"The food is over priced, undercooked and extremely salty. So salty that I sent back 2 dinner plates before I just gave up and left. Third time there and been disappointed every time."}
{"text":"The family and I have come here a number of times. The service is usually slow, but today it was terrible. The wait was very long even though there were several open tables. The wait for food was longer than expected and the food arrived cold or undercooked. This place isn't worth the wait or cost. The food is usually good, but after today, we won't be back."}
{"text":"The service was very good and the restaurant itself was nice and relaxing. The food on the other hand was hit-or-miss. The Brussel sprouts and french fries were delicious, but the tavern burger and grilled chicken fingers were ordinary. A big killer was the small portion size of the salads.   All in all, I wouldn't recommend this as a place to go to in Champaign if you haven't been to the likes of Seven Saints."}
{"text":"Very mixed experience with Big Grove. The first few times I've gone was excellent-- food was served on time and still hot, good service.  Other times have not been so good. After I boasted about the establishment, my friends and I had to wait 30 minutes despite having made a reservation on Friday night. Our food was served lukewarm, certain things on the menu weren't served, and our waiter was hardly seen.   I'd give it a 2 star if it wasn't for their use of local produce, whimsical daily popcorn flavors, and appealing decor. Much like my loyalty to Adam Sandler, I just keep expecting greatness and have great hopes for their future work! A very much romanticized version of Big Grove."}
{"text":"Nice large restaurant with a nice atmosphere and interesting menu. The food was good but could've been much better with additional attention to the texture.   Tavern burger: Mix of beef, bison & pork burger with a red onion marmalade and cornichon aioli. The meat was alright in texture and flavor but was overpowered by the marmalade.  Turkey Horseshoe: Turkey sandwich with beer mustard, 3-cheese mornay cheese sauce, and mixed greens. The mix of mustard flavor and turkey was a good mix.  Trout hash: Nice clean flavors with a mix of nice vegetable elements such as corn and green onion.  Deviled egg: Good texture with nice crispy chip but wasn't a huge fan of the yolk.  Spiced nuts: Fresh and tasty, nothing unusual from other good spiced nuts however.  Fresh baked soft pretzel: Nice mustard but the pretzel itself was a bit tough.  Cornbread: Nice corn flavor and texture, one of the best items of the meal.  Overall, a nice choice if you're not visiting Desithl nearby but a little pricey."}
{"text":"Chicken liver pate, chicken hash, nueske's bacon, mimosas.  Everything tastes really good and the service was pretty good.  Lost a couple of stars for three reasons - 1) drinks went empty twice - it is a small champagne flute so I can cut slack on that 2) side of nueske's bacon for $4.99 was 3 pieces.  I think I would have been embarrassed to charge that if I owned the place. 3) Mimosa was 3/4 OJ.  Again it all tasted really good so if you aren't worried about value then I'd recommend it."}
