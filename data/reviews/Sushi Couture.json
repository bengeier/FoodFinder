{"text":"Always friendly and helpful service. Many of the sushi places on Bloor go for big portions and skimp on quality. I find Sushi Couture has good size portions (without over doing it) and the best quality on the strip."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. The service is VERY slow. Even at 8:30 on a Tuesday when it's not busy it took more than a half hour for our maki to start arriving. That said, it's the best of the Bloor bunch by far so I'll probably be waiting there again soon. I'll just try and remember to have a snack before hand (or to order a large salad) so I'm not starving!!"}
{"text":"Visited Sushi Couture recently for the second time, and enjoyed the most delicious sushi and maki. The rolls were melt in your mouth delicious. The freshest, most flavourful fish and skillfully assembled rolls. By far the most delicious and freshest sushi I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Honestly, nice people, decent decor but not worth a visit. At the risk of sounding arrogant, I know great sushi, and Sushi Couture is not great. It's average at best. Oh, and the service is equally not great.  If you want great sushi at a great price in that neighborhood, go to Sushi On Bloor or Sushi Generation."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi done in interesting ways and just slightly above the Bloor St. price average.  Your extra couple bucks really goes the distance here!

 Their fish is always delightfully fresh and I love the use of the blow torch to add texture and flavour to nigiri. 

I miss their lunch special, though."}
{"text":"Out of all of the sushi I have tasted in Toronto, this place is by far the best. Each time I come back, Ken and his staff continuously serve me exquisite and delicious sushi far beyond my expectations. The Dragon Maki and the Signature Roll are my absolute favorite, but after trying many others such as the yummy Maki and their delicious appetizers, I have come to conclude that I really enjoy a majority of the menu. Appetizers are great and the dessert is unique - green tea cheesecake is especially good! There is really no disappointing me when I dine here. They offer a wide variety of sushi types and there is always very friendly and fast service every time I have gone! :)"}
{"text":"Thought we would try this place out because the reviews seem good. Would not go back! The service was so slooooow first of all. Second, the food was not good at all. I ordered Maki, which tasted a little fishy too me, my friend ordered the noodle dish,...the noodles were so well done, and the sauce was super sweet which didn't go at all, gross! We complained about the dish to our server and he said he would talk to the manager. When the bill came, there was no discount,...full price for the dish which there were only a few bites gone. We actually had to say something, and only then did they discount $5 off of a $17 dish. Third, there were fruit flies buzzing around us all evening. The only thing this place has going for is its ambiance."}
{"text":"Great place - sushi is awesome - good service - nice atmosphere !! I would recommend this place over any other in the area . We travel from the Beaches to eat there !"}
{"text":"Terrible for take out. Their online takeout menu is out of date and actual prices are more expensive. Told me it would take 15-20min, I just waited 45min at the place. Sushi is good but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"First time here and first impressions were good. Decor was a refreshingly trendy change from dingy joints like sushi on bloor. I lived in cali and bc for a number of years and ate enough sushi to worry about mercury poisoning. The selection at s.c is limited, mostly catering to people who consider yam tempura maki to be sushi (no judging here but i firmly believe sushi includes actual raw fish) but their specials menu made up for what the main menu lacked in selection. Definately try madai (seabream) and one of the spicy rolls. They use chili oil instead of te usual spicy mayo. Be warned though, the chili oil lingers and can be overpowering so i wouldnt reccomend eating more than one maki. Sashimi was fresh and cut thick b.c style, but the rice on the makis was a little under seasoned. The sushi couture maki is also must! 

All in all i was impressed w the food, and the service was quick and attentive. A young janpanese (male) server was very knowledgeable and great at reccomending what was prime that day. The girl server however could use a little more training. She gave me hamachi when i ordered hirame, and didn't even acknowledge the fact that she made the mistake. I found a scale in my sashimi dinner, and let the bald server (or manager?) know, he offered an apology and changed my plate. i have high expectations when it comes to service since i've worked in the industry for a really long time. Still, the service great overall, especially compared to some of the other sushi joints on bloor. 

The only disapointment was their lack of cold sake, only nigori available. The price wasn't cheap, but then again you don't come here looking for cheap sushi! They charged $2 extra when I asked them to sub salmon for B.C Tuna, which to me didn't make much sense since B.C Tuna is more expensive than salmon. Still, I find the prices very reasonable, at $110 bucks for dinner for two including tip. Be advised that my bf and I eat A LOT so I doubt what we paid could be considered average for the place. 

All in all,  i probably will make sushi couture my go to when im in the mood for sushi in the annex :)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in the city. Their tataki is mind-blowing, the spicy tuna is incredible and everything is well worth the slightly higher cost. 
Brilliant!
The chef takes such masterful care in all aspects of his dishes that they are not only delicious but also beautiful to look at."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends, and while they were all extremely impressed, I was not quite as happy as them (Maybe I'm hard to please, who knows!)

Anyway, as a vegetarian I asked them to substitute veggie rolls for their dinner combo and they didn't mind (as Rudolf mentioned below hehe). This being said, they charged me extra for the substitution (which I agreed to), but the quality of the rolls was far less than the quality of the rolls that originally came with the combo (I received many simple rolls such as avocado instead of the gourmet-type rolls which were originally part of the combo). The staff did randomly give us some sort of salmon roll on the house (I believe that this is because of my substitution, they never actually told us the reason?), but I wasn't even able to eat it! Of course, my experience as a vegetarian will be different from a fish-eater's.

This being said, the rolls were not amazing but I would say above-average. At one point when I wanted something it took me forever to get the attention of a waiter as they would rush by in a hurry, but the staff generally seemed quite nice. 

Overall not a terrible experience but not an amazing one!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night after volleyball. I liked their food, definitely one of the better ones among all the sushi restaurants in the Annex; but maybe some more staff training would be appreciated.

Food - we ordered a bunch of makis to share. My favourite one is their House Roll \"Couture Maki\" (something like that). It is their most expensive one, but worth the try! It got some seared scallop on top and more like california roll inside.  

If you want some more budget meal, I suggest you to order their combos, they have good mix of different makis in their maki combo (unlike places that just give you california rolls)

Service - because we got their pretty late, and we walked in with 12 people, I didn't expect too much. However, after settling down for 10 minutes, things should be in order. For example, we didn't have our own dish for soya sauce (they ran out of it, I guess they were not washed yet). Both soya sauce bottles on our table were completely empty. They asked us to take our seats when we walked in, and later, they forgot that they haven't cleaned our tables yet, and thought the tea cups left over on the table from previous customers were ours... that's like after sitting down 15-20 mins, when we asked for tea/water.

Service is not the best, but I will go back for their maki."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place on Bloor way better than the place across the street called \"Sushi On Bloor\". Sushi Couture has amazing soup as well as amazing sushi and udon noodles. The staff are focused fun and full of energy. If you looking for great sushi for a decent price this should be your go to place. I don't know why this place doesn't have lines out the door. It's amazing and I defenintly recommend."}
{"text":"My bf and i were walking around trying to decide where to eat and finally decided upon this place because of the name.. like really, sushi couture? we were too curious to NOT go in.

as we walk in, i check in on foursquare and someone said the raw fish was realllly good so obviously i went for that, the bf didnt.. because sadly.. he's allergic to fish =(

honestly it was super good. very fresh and i was very satisfied. Service was good, our waiter was nice and made conversation in a non-creepy way (you knoww what i mean). my bf for udon and he said it tasted pretty normal.

so basicallyyy if you're gonna come here, get the raw fish =)"}
{"text":"The food was great! Excellent fresh fish, and the butter yaki roll was an interesting new experience. Unfortunately the service was shockingly slow, to the point of completely nullifying the great meal. It took around five full minutes to be seated in a roughly half-full restaurant on a Wednesday at 7pm. There were then over twenty minutes between receiving our drink order and our food order being taken. We tried multiple times to make eye contact. One of the items in my dinner combo was left out, but I did get it shortly after pointing it out. It's too bad - our server was nice enough, even apologetic - I think they're just extremely understaffed. I don't think this was a one-off, either - this was my second visit, and the first also involved very slow service, although not to this degree."}
{"text":"Sushi lovers look elsewhere.  Don't let the \"fancy\" name or decor fool you.  This sushi spot has nothing to offer other than that. 

We ordered tempura udon, negihama roll, saba sushi, and the butter yaki maki roll.

The service was terrible! What does it take to get a refill on water these days? The udon arrived and I watched my date eat it. 15 minutes later, my saba sushi arrived, which was cut terribly and was overall pathetic in portion and presentation.  After we both had finished those items, one server came over to clear our plates and asked if we wanted any dessert (biggest faux pas EVER) to which we replied that we were still waiting for our sushi.

Ten minutes passed and I received my butter yaki maki roll.  The presentation was nice and the taste was flavorful, but the portions were pretty sad.  I am not one of those GIMMIE THE BIGGEST SAUCIEST ROLL EVER kinda gals, but I have eaten at some very nice sushi places and the portions were much more substantial than this.  I am not a sushi snob, but I know when it is done right.

We then asked for our bill, realizing we were not going to get the negihama roll.  We recieved the bill and of course the negihama was still on there. We brought the discrepancy to the server's attention, to which he gave no apology and asked us if we still wanted it.  We declined, paid, and left.

The table next to us was having the SAME problems, where they had ordered rolls and they were not coming.

This was a seriously disappointing experience.  Nothing would make me want to return to this restaurant.  There is a recession, folks...and if you want to open a new business, you need to know what the heck you are doing. Obviously these guys do not."}
{"text":"So I decided on Sushi Cuture, to my bewilderment, the food was horrible. 

How they justify charging $70 for two people is beyond my comprehension. The rolls were small, loose, and for the most part tasteless. Not to mention the variety.. or lack there of I should say. Even the miso fell short of any normal dashi flavor. I am certain that in my oriental kitchen (which pales in comparison to other establishments) I have made much better miso and far better sushi rolls. 

Although the service was polite, it was shabby at best. The tables were unprepared and still dirty from the previous Sushi C. suckers. The orders arrived with no side plate, soy dish or even soy sauce for that matter! Furthermore, they skimped on both the wasabi and ginger! How much are you saving on these items exactly? I'm sure I can find powdered wasabi in the grocery store for under $5, which would probably cover the restaurant for the entire night and; copious amounts of ginger with an equally as modest price tag.

There was one thing that was noticeable in my opinion, which was the salmon and avocado rolls. Both the salmon cut and avocado piece were sizable, and I will say that the salmon was quite tender and the avocados ripe. The potential for a fair sashimi was apparent, however. Considering all of the hodgepodge, I believe that this was purely a stroke of luck. Besides, the rolls were still loose.

The Beer was the only thing that worked for me throughout the dinner. I order a bottle of Asahi, which they served in a massive ice frosted mug. Cool and refreshing, I enjoyed the presentation and treatment of my evening beverage thoroughly.

In closing,
Go to Sushi Cuture and grab yourself an oversized, frosted mug of Asahi beer. Then walk to a neighboring sushi bar, any one will do (there are plenty) and enjoy better sushi at half the price, or less..."}
{"text":"I accidentally fell upon this place when i tagged along with a few of my friends to have dinner. This place was selected by the culinary guru among my circle of friends. As the name would suggest, I expected the place to be new, trendy, and hip.  I was not disappointed.

As I walked in, there was a sushi chef with a torch flambe some rolls.  We were promptly seated and the waiter came to inquire immediately on our drink orders.  

The decor itself is very modern given this place is fairly new.  It is your typical hip japanese sushi place that you see often as these new places keep sprouting about.  

Across the street closeby was a huge line up for Sushi on Bloor which I have been before...known mostly for quantity rather than quality, atleast in my book.  This place however was half empty as not many people seem to know of this small hideout.

I ordered the chirashi sushi which came fairly promptly. The butterfish, the salmon, and this other white fish all had alot of flavor, to my surprise.  Most sushi places in Toronto serve sushi that is ok, but lacking flavour. 

I had a good experience and the price was reasonable given that our meals were around $18-20 per person.  The service and food were good. The restaurant was clean and had a good ambiance.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Sushi restaurants are dime a dozen on bloor street. Looking at the ratings on yelp they all range from 3 stars to 3.5 stars, which tells us they are not terrible but they aren't excellent either. During my UT student years, which I still am, I pretty much tried all of them but just like the ratings nothing was memorable. But this restaurant is my favourite. Sushi is usually very fresh, interior is nice and service is good. I like the rolls as they are not salty. And sashimi dinner is a good choice too. Tempuras and udons are alright. But this restaurant isn't open late unlike New generation across the street."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Anyone who's really into sushi knows that the real skill is in the rice. The rice is perfect, perfect texture, every grain is seasoned and pronounced, unlike the sticky inconsistent glop the other student sushi joints on this street serve. 

My girlfriend and I had the dinner special sets with premium sushi and the garnishes on the blowtorched fish had me singing Creed's \"Can You Take Me Higher\" - the garnishes elevated the flavours to new heights. Fish was super fresh and halfway through eating I was so sad because it the flavour party was almost OVER.

There was a light buttery garlic glaze on some of the pieces - my BFF had her eyes rolled back so much while she was eating I am embarrassed for her to say here that it may have been her ecstasy face. 

How is this place not crammed with line ups out the door! HOW! Ok it's a little pricier than the aforementioned sushi neighbours, but this is more of a date night, I want to eat at Miku or Japango but can't afford it type of deal. It's cheaper than going to the Keg ok?! 

It's real quiet in there. :S Decor is nice. Bathrooms clean, no funky smell. 

7/7 stars would hit it up again."}
{"text":"Why five stars? It's as simple as this: Torontonians should get down on their knees and thank the Goddess that they have a place to order sushi of this quality at these prices, where you can actually sit down and enjoy eating it. Instead, we see self-indulgent little 1- and 2-star Yelp tantrums that pass for reviews by people who hold this place to standards appropriate for places charging far more.

This place may not stand alone, but it is clearly one of just a handful of sushi joints in town that distinguish themselves from the pack by the sheer quality of the fare, regardless of price. And at these prices, this place is simply remarkable, and folks would do well to keep that in mind as a balance to any occasional lapse in service, especially during peak hours. O.K.?

Love the Sushi Couture Roll and the eggplant appetizer (which does include a coating of katsuobushi shavings, so be forewarned, all you lovers of westernized sushi)."}
{"text":"One of my favorite toronto restaurants, period! I'm a sashimi fan, and their fish is always fresh, and cut and prepared to perfection. I like others (like Japango and Yuzu (which has a great sake cellar), but Sushi Couture, with their great sea food. And great rolls is my most frequented restaurant (Japanese or otherwise) period! I love eating there!"}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi on this stretch of Bloor, and we've tried a bunch.  They're still working on ideal service and speed, but it's a month in, and the difference over time is visible.  But the part that really matters is the food.  I've been there four times now, and each time I've come away happy, full, and content.

If you know and love Japango, the chef is the former sous chef from Japango, and the fish supplier is the same.  The quality is unmistakeable, and they call out the new arrivals each day, if you really want to nom on some killer sashimi.

I tend towards the sashimi end of the spectrum more than maki, and I find the portions are entirely reasonable, and the selection is good.  The Sushi Couture roll is fantastic, and really shows off the talent we're dealing with.  They don't overdo the rice, so the rolls don't look as big, but the contents are fish-centric, so the value is there unless you just want a lot of rice...

The decor is crisp and modern, and there's plenty of seating, without being too big to maintain quality, so I'm a fan of the work.  Booths are big and comfy, and the tables are cozy but not too cozy.  Really just hits the right notes for me.

Unless you're a broke college student, there just really isn't a reason to pick any other sushi joint in the Annex."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. The service and the food were abysmal. First, it took us asking more than once to even get our order taken. My drink didn't come until 15 minutes after i ordered, again asking multiple times. We had to ask multiple times for everything. Then, our food took AN HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTES. We should have got up and left, but we were starving. When the food finally did come, everything came staggered, so myself and my two friends never had food at the same time. We were brought the wrong dishes, and when we finally got our meals, they were terrible. there speciality roll looked like a sad california roll drenched in mayo- and the salmon was cooked one top- which wasn't specified. extremely overpriced. When we asked for the status of our food, our waitresses played dumb, even when we pointed out it had been well over an hour, they answered with \"oh don't worry its coming\". At one point, one waitress just mumbled awkwardly and walked away. I cannot stress how poor of n experience this was. It wasn't very busy, and it didn't look like people were picking up take out, either. Not a single apology from any staff. BAD BAD BAD BAD SAVE YOUR MONEY AND JUST WAIT IN LINE FOR SUSHI ON BLOOR."}
{"text":"Really good sushi restaurant in the Annex.  Lunch specials are amazing value, and you get much better quality rolls than at the better know cheap sushi restaurants in the area.  Very interesting and well put together rolls.  The sushi couture make was a hit!  And bonus: if you do not want the dessert as part of the lunch special, you can have an additional maki roll!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent. They had great sushi and didn't mind substitutions for vegetarians.

The greatest thing was the sushi that was brought out on the house. It had grilled salmon on top of it and was kind of like a special roll like the Dragon Roll. It was amazing, really the highlight of the place since I ordered the typical California Roll and Salmon Rolls."}
{"text":"Sushi Couture is my favourite sushi place in the neighbourhood, by far! For the life of me, I cannot understand why people eat at any of the other sushi places in the Annex where the sushi tastes like the ready-made stuff in the grocery store. Sushi Couture is next level - high standard, deliciously fresh fish. You can taste the difference in quality here. 

Most of the staff are terrific. I am gluten intolerant and they understand what products contain gluten and make substitutions. They also have gluten-free soy sauce which is a huge bonus. 

It's a bit dark near the back of the restaurant, but it's clean and the tables aren't crowded together. 

Give Sushi Couture a try."}
{"text":"The food here is still good.

The service? Worse than last time. The waiter/waitress there at the time took a while to get back to us. Several people in my group ordered meals that came with salad and miso soup. They forgot the soup. 

It wasn't busy at all. I don't know if it was just a bad day for them or if it's a common occurrence there, but I'm less inclined to go there with a group again. 

But the food is good. I still recommend the soft shell crab for those who like shellfish. Chicken karaage is good too."}
{"text":"Great place to get the freshest, tastiest sushi and sushi chef Ken always gives me something special which is a very nice touch.  Also very well priced for the freshest fish in the city.  Order the chef's special and a spicy anything handroll and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Those who have commented on the hit-or-miss service were not exaggerating: I went with two friends tonight for dinner, one's order was forgotten not once, but twice, and it was a simple spicy tuna maki. Not the hardest thing ever. 

That said, the freshness of this place's fish is unparalleled at this price range. The BC Tuna melts in your mouth. The salmon is almost buttery. Their maki has a little too much tobiko (orange fish roe) for my liking, but otherwise it was great. 

The cost is also a bit on the high side: $35 for one can of Sapporo, the dynamite maki, spicy salmon maki (ordered bc the dynamite roll was about half the size as it is elsewhere in the city, which drove up the overall cost of my meal -- had i just had the dynamite, it wouldnt have been mentionable) and 2 pieces of BC Tuna.

Would I go again? Absolutely, I especially want to come back during their lunch special as the prices are much more my style, but Ill walk in expecting slow service."}
{"text":"Food:
Sushi Dinner Deluxe: nigiri sushi + butter yaki maki
The maki was very flavourful and the nigiri pieces were fresh and tasty.

Katsu Don: the pork itself was alright but they had shredded broccoli in that dish which I found weird

Overall food here was a bit pricey compared to other sushi places on Bloor, but the food quality was also better than other places nearby. The restaurant was always pretty quiet during my visits both on weekdays and weekends, and service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I consider myself a bit of a veg sushi connoisseur, since I'm vegan and have nothing to say re: 'epic fish quality' which this place seems to prize itself on. 

Service was friendly. I got take-out and they brought me some water to drink while I waited.

Food - meh. It was alright but not enough to go out of my way to eat here. The avocado was far too firm, and the yam in the yam rolls was severely under-cooked and sparingly packed. With veg sushi the quality of the ingredients is of the utmost importance - with carrot and cucumber it's all basically the same but a firm avocado and an under-cooked yam can totally ruin a meal. Drowned it out in soy sauce (which you shouldn't have to do, if it's well made food)."}
{"text":"Sushi Couture was disappointing, for sure. Originally, I saw the sign from the street, and was not at all interested in visiting (ugh font fail). However, a trusted co-worker texted me on a weeknight (!!) proclaiming his love for this sushi couture roll, and demanded (!!!) I give it a try.

Fast forward a week, and my girlfriend and I are finished shopping for housewares, and have rumbling tummies. How about we try this new sushi place, I say, It will likely be fast, they cannot be too busy at 5pm on a Saturday. 
 
So clearly, this place is a step up in terms of decor, and price, from the usual Annex sushi offerings. 

We sat and waited in a booth, in the closest booth to the sushi bar, where three chefs were prepping for the night ahead. We were one of only two tables. Eventually someone came to take our order. We chose three different rolls to share. Our tea was not refilled until we asked (with the bill) and the rolls came out after a ridiculously long time. We were sitting RIGHT THERE. It was like they continued to prep for the night, and would make one of ours on a whim. We were fully finished each before the next came, it was a truly uncomfortable staggering. 

The fish was very fresh, the presentation lacking, the service terrible. We felt completely ignored.  Bill was over $30.

This couture roll my coworker was mad-texting about was good, torched salmon with scallop and fish eggs, but to be honest, my experience at Big Sushi just down the street a couple days later was shockingly better. 

Less then Meh + Very Fresh Fish = 2 Stars."}
{"text":"Came here with no prior knowledge of it other than reading a few reviews on google. Decided to try out a sushi place as I'm not really the biggest sushi fan, however, my expectations were exceeded. One of the few times I've actually enjoyed sushi, & everything tastes fresh. The chef is at the entrance so you can check out your sushi being made, and it is definitely a plus that the service was great. Our waitress was always there when needed and offered help in choosing what to order. Overall, the prices were great especially on the lunch menu, & I would recommend this place for anyone looking for quality sushi at a quality price."}
{"text":"Sushi Couture falls in that middle ground between cheapo-depot sushi (see New Gen/Sushi On Bloor) and tasty, but pricey, good stuff (see Japango, Solo Sushi).

Decor is lounge-y, music choice was definitely very Kenny G.-inspired.

Sushi prices are reasonable - a sashimi dinner and a couple of maki rolls were plenty for 2 people to share. Service is friendly and attentive.

In short: if you're in the mood for sushi, aren't looking for a particularly \"special\" experience, it's a nondescript weekday, but are also suspicious of ridiculously cheap fish, Sushi Couture is a good option."}
{"text":"Don't let the padlock on the door fool you, this place is open for business. The decor is upscale with dark walls and pot lights. Unfortunately there is no seating at the bar so you cannot watch the chefs go to work.

I came here on a Monday at 530 and was the only patron.  I ordered the charishi sushi which is sixteen pieces of sashimi on a bed of sushi rice as well as a salmon and tuna maki.

The dinner also comes with soup and salad. Both are standard and fine. 

The rolls appear to be smallish if you are used to other places on the bloor St. Strip but this place knows what it is doing. It gives you a ton of fish and just enough rice. By far the best example of maki on this strip and one of the better ones in the city. The fish in the rolls was extremely fresh and overall excellent. 

The charishi included hamachi, tuna, bc tuna, salmon and egg. Please believe me when I say that this fish was ridiculously fresh. The chef added some garlic sauce on to the already stellar butterfish.. Perfection! The owner dropped the food and spoke about the fish with a real passion. Something that is sorely lacking around these parts! Absolutely makes other places on bloor pale in comparison.

He also said that it is tough to draw new customers to this place with all of the competition but hoped that quality will win out. I am sure that this place will be a huge success as the fish is excellent and the owner really cares about the quality of his product.

In addition I also received a free roll courtesy of the chef which included salmon, cucumber, avocado, tobiko, spicy mayo and crab. It was outrageous! Very flavorful and meaty. 

Overall a super meal. I'm really impressed. With this new spot as it is miles above what other sushi joints are offering up. 

Note: no liquor yet but the licence should be ready in a month or two. Owner promised lots of sake so we'll see. 

If you are looking for sushi on the annex skip new generation and SoB and try this gem!

Total cost for my meal (which could easily feed two.. Hey I wanted to try a bunch of things!) was $30 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best sushi I've had in this city and can't even be compared to other fast food sushi joints in the Annex.  I come from Vancouver where I was spoiled for good sushi.  I can definitely taste the love and care put into this food.

Every item i've eaten here has literally melted in my mouth.  There's something so delicate about the way the sushi is prepared and I don't understand how someone could review the food as being tasteless.  I know a guy who lives on McDonald's and fast food and returned his organic chicken burger cuz he said it tasted off.  Some people who are used to eating crap, just can't appreciate real flavours.

I had the crunchy maki tonight, for example, and i swear, every time I took a bite I tasted a whole other layer from the last bite and then another flavour magically revealed itself in the 3rd bite...of the same roll!  My whole meal was a delightful tastebud adventure.  

In my opinion, they are undercharging for their quality and level of sushi preparation.

Food aside, compared to the other cheapo sushi restaurants in the Annex, this is a great place to go on a date because of the lighting, roomy booths and servers that don't throw the bill on your table as soon as you take your last bite."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi in Annex, among the sea of mediocre, rice overstuffed sushi in the area. Very pleasant staff. But the fresh beautiful fish and the maki rolls are what you come here for. Now offering a menu of specials for dinner, also a better value than before. I've never been disappointed. Must try is he sushi dinner and some of the specialty rolls."}
{"text":"I've tried alot of the lunch specials on Bloor Street and I would Say Sushi Couture has my favorite. They do a Butter Yaki roll (8pc) with an option of an additional 6pc of mango/avocado roll or a dessert ice cream. It comes with a soup and a choice of drink. For me this is preferable over the lettuce heavy salads that are offered at other joints. The sushi quality at Sushi couture is also superb. I feel like the atmosphere inside the restaurant is super inviting and I would eat in if I had the time every lunch. The staff are super friendly and if you are a regular they will recognize you!"}
{"text":"***4.5 stars ***

Sushi Couture is one of the many sushi spots in the Annex area.  My SO and I decided to check it out after reading a few yelp reviews that gave this place positive reviews.  The signage of this place makes it look very deceiving.  The decor inside is quite trendy and tastefully done up.  The seating is comfortable and spacious; makes you want to sit and enjoy your meal unlike the other cramped sushi spots in the Annex.

The fish was fresh and rolls did not have excessive amount of rice.  Try their spicy salmon, it is very interesting, not like any other spicy salmon roll I have tried before - careful it does pack some heat.

Price range is competitive to the other sushi spots - we ordered two rolls & dinner special which came to ~$40 with tip.  Our server was super friendly, she even brought us an extra miso soup for no charge.

Check Sushi Couture if you are in the Annex area!"}
{"text":"Expectations were a little low going in.  Sunday night.  Unknown neighborhood in unknown town, somewhere in Canada.  Place was not busy.

Pleasantly surprised!      Waiter was spot on with everything, very knowledgeable, good recommendations.    The fish was really really good, we loved the sea bream.  Rolls decent, had the spicy tuna and the rainbow.  

thought value was decent, two people, two drinks,  nigiri and maki, was ~$70, believe that makes it $$$

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times.

First time, food was very good, service was awful.

Second time, food was good, service was awful.

Third time, food was mediocre, service was awful.

There's not going to be a fourth time.  I admit that they have some items on the menu that are nice and that are different from other sushi restaurants.   I enjoy getting to try new things.  But if your service is going to be bad, you've got to provide consistently special food.  This place just doesn't do that."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi place in Toronto. I would highly recommend the spicy maki set. 

The fish is consistently extremely fresh and flavourful with nice presentation. Hands down the best flavoured butterfish and salmon I have ever had and only a few dollars more than the other sushi joints in the area. The rolls are not too ricey, which allows you to taste more of the fish. The restaurant has an intimate vibe with very friendly and attentive staff. 

A must try if you are looking for delicious quality sushi vs. quantity."}
{"text":"If you're looking for miso soup, salad, and the basic \"Maki\" or \"rolls\", then you'd be short changing yourself by coming here. The chefs put a lot of thought into their creations and if you're looking for \"avocado rolls\" or \"salmon rolls\", you're not going to be able to experience the creations that are offered.

On that note, the Sushi Couture Signature roll is amazing, as well as the butterfish.

The service in general is good. Nelson is awesome."}
{"text":"It's been more than four years since the first time I've come to Sushi Couture, but the quality of their food has still remained stellar. Their service has improved by leaps and bounds -- no need to ask for refills because the servers are like friendly hawks on a mission to seek and destroy empty or hall-full cups of tea, and bring guests the adequate amount of soy sauce. 

I recently came for a Sushi Dinner along with a bit of a la carte. Fresh sea urchin right from the shell (the sushi chef proudly brandished the shell from which he evacuated the delicious meat), fatty, marbled salmon, tuna, and blowtorched sea bream with that perfect undertone of smoky aroma. 

I also had Japanese Halfbeak (Sayori) that came with a special sake-infused soy sauce. Extraordinarily fresh and clean flavour with zero fishiness. It's mild flavour was accentuated by both the special soy sauce and the real wasabi that was offered. Not overly pungent, but actually aromatic and sweet with just a hint of zing. 

Currently, they serve omakase from $75-$150. I'm looking forward to going back sometime to try one of them! Based on some of the pictures on their facebook, it looks like a real treat."}
{"text":"It blows my mind this place is more than 1 star. Presenting some store bought, frozen chicken nuggets on a large plate with a slice of lemon and piece of parsley and charging an extra $2 is not acceptable practice. I was stunned and genuinely embarrassed on their behalf. Don't get me wrong, I love chicken nuggets but I can go buy a box of Janes brand nuggets myself (which is exactly what I was served). This is not karaage. What the actual fuck."}
{"text":"Hey guys,

I've had a chance to come here with coworkers and by myself a few times, and have always been impressed with the freshness of the fish, prices and atmosphere.

This is hands down the best sushi place in the area.

The one downer is that the staff has a tendency to bring out the food at different times so you can expect to wait 15 minutes between the first and last dishes arriving at the table.

Overall, I totally recommend it."}
{"text":"This place was the worst, fine not \"the worst\" but definitely terrible. First and for most there is no air conditioning. I spent the entire meal fanning my self with a menu, even our server was beading sweat. The service was extremely slow. It took us about 15 min to get our order taken. We ordered diet cokes which our server forgot to bring. I wasn't going to  say anything until I saw that they were still on the bill. The food took forever. We ordered ikura sushi(salmon roe) which came after we got the bill.  Apparently they only had enough for 1 piece(order has 2) but instead of making it 1 decent one she split into 2. Our server said that she was going to alter our bill to reflect the 1/2 order but never did. The whole experience was just a disaster. Never again. The only redeeming factor is that their salmon sushi was amazing."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in the neighbourhood, and some of the best sushi in town. An especially welcome relief from the staggering number of mediocre (and worse!) sushi joints in the Annex. A little pricey, but so are most things in that neighborhood. The fish is invariably fresh, delicate, prepared innovatively and with flourish. Have been going there regularly for years, and have never been disappointed. Great service, and fantastic deep booths in the back to hide in from the maddening crowds of drunken U of T undergrads."}
{"text":"Average sushi place, nothin' special. I got the spicy butter fish maki, spicy salmon maki, and sakura maki. It's not a great sign when the best one on the plate is the plain old avocado, bonito, spicy sauce roll. I tend to dislike chopped fish in my maki, and that's what this place offered. And it tasted too fatty/rubbery."}
{"text":"Came here for their lunch special ($6.99, plus $2 for special items). I ordered the Sushi Couture Maki with Sakura Maki. Loved that the signature roll was seared at the top since typically I don't find seared sushi on lunch menus. Really amazing deal, and it comes with miso soup, and a drink (or salad). 

The decorations were lovely, the seating was comfortable, and the staff were very friendly. Compared to other sushi lunches on this street, I would say that this is one of my top."}
{"text":"When I think \"couture\" I think Yves Saint Laurent, Ralph Rucci, Pierre Cardin.  I think dripping jewels and extravagant hats.  I think parties that I'm not invited to.  Sushi Couture is more like the Gap.  Decent quality but not exactly the cutting edge.

This restaurant is a mixed bag.  It has some of the freshest, loveliest fish on the sushi strip (aka Bloor street), but the service is bad and so is their consistency.  I had one meal here that was lovely and one that was terrible - maybe they were training a new sushi chef that night?

I ordered four handrolls that were rolled so poorly that two of them slowly started falling over in their little handroll stands and almost spilled out their contents on the table.  My husband's veggie sushi rolls were fine, but small.  Vegetarians take note: you'll have more luck and variety at the old standby (aka Sushi on Bloor) than this spot.

While we were sitting at our table, waiting 45 minutes for our sushi to come to the table, customers on both sides of us had orders come to their table wrong or not come at all.  Again, maybe it was an off-night, but with a name like \"couture\" it was a real disappointment.  

Next time, diamonds on the rims of the teacups?...

Vegetarian score: 5/10.  You can dine once or twice, but then you exhaust your options."}
{"text":"I went there and the first thing I noticed inside the miso soup bowls was that the red paint actually chipped off. Scrape it gently with your chopsticks and you'll see!

Secondly, the sauce on their signature maki covered up any taste that was could have been further portrayed. 

We ordered the Sashimi dinner just for an assortment and there were 5 pieces of salmon that were not fatty at all. For $25.95, having 5 pieces of non fatty chunky salmon was not appetizing.

I was happy to find that they had freshly grounded wasabi which was very fun to experience! That was probably the biggest wow factor.

I think you could go elsewhere if you're looking for great fish. Also, their seasonal selection was fairly poor. No toro at all which was kind of disappointing."}
{"text":"Best sushi on the Bloor annex strip. Apparently the chef at Sushi Couture used to be at Japango (which is also excellent compared to your standard Toronto sushi joint)- it shows.

Sashimi dinner- yes. Sashimi don- yes. Signature sushi couture roll- yes. Nasu dengaku- yes. The name of the restaurant (a play on Juicy Couture I'm assuming?)- no. But if this is one of the worst things about Sushi Couture, I think it's safe to give it 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, 4 for the food!  I've been here twice.  The interior is really swank compared to most sushi restaurants in the area.  I really enjoy the sushi.  It is fresh, it is tasty and it comes prepared like an art project.  I find that at Sushi Couture the soup and salad, which are usual sub par at every sushi place, are actually really good.  The miso soup has chunks of mushroom in it and the salad has sesame seeds in it and is more green than white lettuce (you know what I'm talking about, the reject white lettuce leaves that taste like garbage from a head of iceberg lettuce).

They don't have a vegetarian lunch time special but if you ask they'll create one for you!  Such good customer service.

The one let down is that the service itself was slow.  My friend had to ask for more water, I had to ask for soy sauce etc.  Also, it was 1:45 so the lunch rush had just ended.  There were still some tables that were yet to be cleaned surrounding us, so that kind of took away from the experience.

Overall, I really like Sushi Couture.  It is definitely far better than most places on the Bloor St. strip.  A must try for those who enjoy sushi!"}
{"text":"Come here regularily for the most fresh and best sashimi. Service can be hit/miss at times, but food quality is the highest. Had a friend that worked in the fish business and sushi couture is one of the few that will order the highest quality fish, with regular deliveries (i.e. always fresh). Freshness is key.

Had 8 course omakase on more than one occasion, I would highly recommend it. 2.5-3 hours of beautiful and tasty sushi, sashimi and japanese eats."}
{"text":"Happy to be back here for a second visit, things here seem to be consistent with my last visit. I love the spicy salmon and spicy tuna maki, and I also had an order of the butter fish sashimi, which was very tasty. 

For a party of four, we were all pleased with our orders and service. I should note that service isn't especially fast here, but I like that because I always end up here when I'm visiting and catching up with friends, thus I will take all the time I can get!"}
{"text":"Competent sushi, attentive staff and reasonable prices. Sushi Couture roll was particularly good. Recommended."}
{"text":"Im giving this place a high rating because the quality of food was high, and it was noticeably better than average sushi restaurants so the bit of higher price for some of the items was actually worth it. 

I did takeout here the other day. These are my observations. The decor is super dark with red velvet curtains. Its a little dark an cold seeming for my tastes, and I don't like when a place tries really hard with decor but overlook details like dusting cobwebs off plants.

Most importantly though, the food was really really good. I eat sushi a lot, at varying levels of restaurants. There were two of us so we got the sashimi dinner, spicy salmon roll, dynamite roll, and the avocado cucumber roll. The sashimi was really good, better than other regular sushi restaurants. The fish was all nicely cut, really fresh seeming and good texture, and they gave nice fish that was  just lightly seared with that blue flame they thing use. My only problem with that was that some of those pieces tasted REALLY like the flame or the gasoline or whatever and it was a bit overpowering and odd, but still overall good. They gave all the good fish too like salmon, butterfish, octopus, and not too much tuna.  The dynamite roll was good, they top it with a LOT of orange roe.It had a bit of a different taste than common dynamite rolls, and you can tell the oil they used was clean, sometimes I order dynamite rolls and the roll tastes like fishy oil thats been re-used over and over to fry the tempura. The Veggie roll was really good too, just like really big, perfectly ripe pieces of avocado it was actually really good better than usual.  Spicy tuna was also really good. They give white ginger and good wasabi. The miso soup and salad were also really high quality. Everything was just of a bit better quality than most average sushi restaurants,so I didn't mind paying a bit extra for the sashimi dinner. One thing that pissed me off was though that they forgot to give me soy sauce which was so annoying.

So overall food was really good, the service seemed nice enough. But I'm not a huge fan of the cold and imperfect decor. If you're going to try to make a statement, do it well, and make sure it seems really clean. I don't like seeing things like dust on plants and somewhat sticky looking tables and stuff. The price is more than regular sushi restaurants, so they should try to keep the place looking clean and tidy because it makes people want to eat! Honestly, I think they should revamp the place a bit, like make it a bit more bright, cozy, and inviting. Especially the area near the door and the entire entrance area, it just needs something to draw the customers in a bit more."}
{"text":"Like most sushi lovers working downtown, I tried to squeezed myself into Japango for lunch, where you have to watch the way you sit, otherwise, your lunch buddy's miso soup will be all over you. But that place still packed, we love it.

That is why, when I read on Toronto life that the chef from Sushi couture was trained in Japango for like 5 yrs (or 7yrs?) I wanted to try it right away. 

After a year lol, finally I went to this place. I will give Japango a 4 but here a 3. 

At  a glance of sushi bar, I can see fish is absolutely fresh, kept  in wooden box, very authenthic way. So that I ordered Chiriashi right away, and my friend ordered Sashimi Don. We also ordered a deep fried soft shell crab as appetizer.

Love the soft shell crab, juicy and crispy, dipping some vinegar, PERFECT.

Chirashi was beautifully displayed in a box using unagi don tho, love the butter fish, very good. 

Sashimi don is more like the Korean way, that you eat it together with the hot sauce. My friend enjoyed it. 

The inner deco is very trendy and tasteful, even the tea cup is nice. 

I might be too picky but.. I expected a little bit more variety in my Chirashi (just one more kind will be good ), also, I think.. it is suppose to served in a round bowl.  Also, I hope the owner can spend some extra to upgrade the menu a little bit. 

Maybe too many plants indoor, there were small insects all the time around my table, kinda annoying later."}
{"text":"I cam again with my mom last night, wanted her to try the awesome sushi they offer. Food was just as good as last time, but I have to say the service left some room to improve.

Ordered Tempura Udon, Eggplant app, and Sashimi dinner, which should have come with 2 salads and soups. They only brought one at first, until about 15 mins later, he noticed and gave us a 2nd one. This also made all our other dishes come out later. 

Eggplant came out, then a Chicken Udon. I told him, and they gave me a side tempura dish.  The tempura sauce didn't have any radish in it (not a deal breaker, just an observation). 

What surprised me was that the Sashimi was the last to come out. I guess we could have specified that we want it as an appetizer. 

I also didn't like that during our conversation, the waitress was timid, and seemed to need permission to refill my tea. 

I really like the fish here, and really fresh. I just wish they had some sort of Sashimi platter instead of a la carte or 16 pieces.
I guess you can order two."}
{"text":"Best Japanese in Toronto after Hashimoto and Kaji. Haven't tried JaBistro yet but will soon. Service can be a bit spotty at times but it can also be amazing at others - nothing to overcome the best sushi on the Bloor Strip...The Couture Maki is legendary."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to this place to catch up because she was craving sushi.  The venue is quite nice. It has a romantic, dim light setting.  Not exactly what I expected for a sushi place on Bloor as it was just a meet up with a friend lol. 

I ordered the grilled eggplant with bonito flakes and the vegetarian maki combo which came with miso soup.  The miso soup was excellent.  It had a very natural flavour and not msg-y or salty.  In terms of the vegetarian maki, the rice to vegetable ratio was very good and in a lot of the rolls, you could taste the freshness of the vegetable, fruits (mango) and the seaweed and rice.  

However, I thought the real star of the show for me was the grilled eggplant.  It had a very good sweet teriyaki flavour and was presented beautifully (I don't have a picture but it was cut up and peeled and made to look like a fish).  

My friend ordered the bento box, which looked huge and delicious.  

Verdict: Slightly on the pricier side, but it's probably one of the better sushi spots on Bloor."}
{"text":"Swanky Japanese in the Annex.  Yup, you heard it right!  It's a nice change from the same same university hang outs like New Gen, Big Sushi, and Sushi on Bloor...but at what cost!?!?

1. Dinner was $20/person without alcohol and with a free roll (because they took so damned long to serve us).

2. Service was severely lacking.  If you're gonna be swanky, your service needs to be bang on.  If I wanted bad service (to die for), I'd go to New Gen!  Zing!

3. The Couture Roll was fantastic ($11 or $12 I believe).  It had a wonderful medley of grilled and raw seafood in roll form.  A must have dish!

4. Overall, there's a notable quality difference between this place and the cheaper alternatives.  Fresh fish is apparently flown in from all over the place.

5. It is a nice place to treat yourself to, but for the price difference, I'd be just as content with Big Sushi or Sushi on Bloor.  What can I say, I like my sushi like I like my women: big, ghetto, and cheap!

3 stars, worth a visit or if you want to class it up for a meal."}
{"text":"Sushi Couture gets 5/5 stars from me. Why? Because this place nails it on Price, Quality and Service. 

Let's start with the food. Their Sushi Couture roll is to die for. That fresh scallop is on point. Their soft shell crab is on point. Their sashimi appetizer plate is...ON POINT. 

Moving on to service. The waiters are awesome, patient and ready to make insightful recommendations based on your palate. On top of that, the owner is a really nice guy. He greets you with a friendly smile and he's always there working on the line. You can tell by the quality and consistency of the food that he puts love and care in every item of food that goes out. The interior ambiance is great too. 

Price. After order 3 appetizers, 2 rolls and a few drinks, the bill came under $60. My jaw dropped. Why? Because I was full, happy and have definitely paid more for sushi before and left the restaurant PO'd. 

I challenge anyone to find me $60 a-la Carte sushi for 3 apps, 2 drinks and 2 rolls in this city that hits the same quality as Sushi Couture. Ya that's what I thought. 

So if you're looking for a comfortable place with delicious food, great service and leave you with change in your wallet to pay for an Uber home, look no further."}
{"text":"This is one of my all-time favourite sushi joints.  Also was my first omakase sushi experience (call ahead to schedule and just give them your price point).

From the live shrimp to the oyster shooter to the sushi couture special roll, I have always been more than impressed!  I've never ordered directly off the menu, strictly omakase so I can't speak for that.  

I only have 2 complaints:  1.  It's inconsistent in regards to having your server explain each course which IMO should be mandatory for a tasting experience.  2.  There is ZERO air conditioning!!   In Ontario summers + raw fish, I think you kinda need air conditioning.

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Sushi Couture is excellent, I've eaten here for both dinner and lunch. Their rolls and sushi and are of exceptional quality for the price. It's clear that the chef is passionate, creative, and takes great care of his food. They also have a great lunch menu that beats out all the other spots in the Annex. $6.95 (main + side + soup + beverage/salad). The lunch options are amazing. You can get upgraded items for an additional $2 (total of $8.95) which is a steal considering it includes high end ingredients such as fresh scallops and lobster on rolls that you rarely see on other lunch specials. I don't know why it has taken me so long to try this place out considering it's been in the Annex for many years. But no doubt, it is now my go-to sushi spot in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Best sushi on maki mile!
Service can be slow, but they try and they're nice. There is attention to detail and the ratio of fish to rice is where it should be, ie, more fish than sushi. Also they use a good grade of rice."}
{"text":"The sushi is very modern. Although I am not a fan of untraditional sushi, I am surprisingly fond of their sushi couture. I ordered on the feedback app and the order processed was presented in a timely manner. Looks like there's a great deal for lunch special too!"}
{"text":"The lesson here is you get what you pay for. We got the lunch combos here, and everything was okay (not great, but okay considering how inexpensive it was). What was NOT okay is that the chicken karagge was not karagge at all but some sort of cheap, frozen, store-bought chicken nuggets. We paid extra $2 for this \"karagge\" combo and it is definitely false advertising. On the plus side, our server was very friendly and sweet."}
{"text":"Although the service was poor, no tea refills, and the restaurant was not even busy, the Chirashi was good. White tuna sashimi was prepared really well - different from other Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"Innovative sushi specials.  Regular rolls are great.  Spicy tuna quite spicy.  MIso soup is quite subtle and seaweed salad was very fresh and not too salty.  Forget the wait at Sushi on Bloor; spend a bit more money and get so much more value. We ill be back!"}
{"text":"Great dining experience here, pretty much top of the line. The interior is modern and trendy yet they offer mid-range prices.The portions are generous but not enormous (unlike the mammoth special rolls at Big Sushi). 

The miso soup is above avg. the salad is delicious, and the edamame is served steaming hot and salted. The udon is flavorful and has a good amount of chicken and veg..the best part is it's under $10! The maki rolls were all very well crafted and you could tell the chef took the time to choose quality ingredients and presented them quite nicely. Their a la carte hand rolls are a steal at $3-4 each and they are stuffed full of the good stuff with very little rice. probably the best thing here however, is the yaki maki roll which are little succulent pieces of maki and topped with seared white fish and drizzled in special sauce. I believe you can get a maki combo that comes with both this yaki maki and a spicy salmon roll...~$13 I believe.

Anyways, I love this place and try to keep it a special bi-weekly or longer occasion. You know, I've got to make my rounds to all the other great eateries in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Been here about four times and I have no idea why this place is so quiet. Maybe too pricey for the hood? Worth it to me! The staff are adorably sweet, and the butter yaki maki special is a delight for all senses! Solidly done miso soup too. The green tea cheesecake and illy coffee that came with are (admittedly unusual for a sushi resto) a lovely treat! A booth in the back is my secret hiding place to get some work done over said coffee. No one minds me hanging out!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite sushi spots in the city - especially for lunch! 
The butter yaki maki roll is so, so, so good. A little bit on the mayo-y side but I love the torched deliciousness. 

For lunch, I usually get the butter yaki maki + mango avocado roll and it comes with a soup + choice of drink (they serve illy coffee/pop/green tea) - for only $6.95 + tax!!

It's a nice sit down area if you have more time."}
{"text":"If you go here, you're going for FRESH sushi. Obviously if you don't like raw fish, you're missing the whole point of the restaurant. 

Recommended:
- SASHIMI (must order)
- Maki dinner (must order)
- Chicken Karaage
- Spicy scallop maki
- Unagi don
- Udon

I've been about 30 times now, and almost every time the fish was very fresh. One time it wasn't as fresh, and that was on a Sunday.

This is really great quality for the price.


I think some of the comments about the slow service are a bit overboard. Yes, it can be slow at times. I think that's just the style of the restaurant... they're quality over speed. Servers are friendly and helpful, so I'm sure if you're in a rush you could get served faster.

This is the only sushi place I will consider going to on Bloor. I'm happy to pay a couple dollars more for higher quality"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday with a friend, and BOY WAS I DISAPPOINTED.
We were basing it on the reviews that Yelp had for this place.  

We went, and my friend had ordered the chirashi, and I had myself the sushi couture roll.  When we were to order, we had to flag down the waiters.  The salad and miso soup came by really quickly - nothing too special.

THEN we waited. And we waited. And we waited.  No food.  Half an hour later... Still no food.  We had to flag down the waiter at least THREE times to get our food.  My friend flagged down the waiter the second time and got her chirashi, and I pretty much waited for another 15 minutes, and flagged down the waiter to get MY food.

Food was good.  However, was it worth it to sit there the entire time?  Not really."}
{"text":"Sushi Couture is a welcome step up from the generic cheap sushi places on Bloor (New Gen, Sushi on Bloor, etc).

The sushi is much better than the generic Bloor places, both in freshness and preparation. As others have mentioned, the chef and one of the servers are from Japango, and the food is very comparable, down to the melt-in-your-mouth seared butterfish and BC tuna. It's Japango quality, but with enough seating that you can walk in without a reservation.

I usually get the deluxe sushi dinner or a chirashi box (and to whoever complained about the bed of rice included in the chirashi box - that's how chirashi is supposed to be made).

The service has always been impeccable when the ex-Japango waiter (bald/shaved head gentleman) is serving us; it can be a bit slower otherwise, but certainly nothing to complain about.

The prices are very reasonable, e.g. $16 for the sushi dinner - frankly I'm surprised you can get such good quality for only a few bucks more than the cheap places."}
{"text":"If you want really good sushi (not cheap sushi) this is the place to go to in the Annex. Each piece comes out like a work of art and tastes just as good. The fish is extremely fresh, you won't find piles of rice on their maki and their flavour combinations are amazing. Try the \"sushi couture maki\" to experience bliss."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to a place called Blowfish but it was closed, since it was a holiday weekend and a Sunday many of my friends suggestions were dead-ends.  We luckily found this gem hidden in a block of bad looking sushi spots - don't let the bad name fool you this place serves great fresh fish and the sushi chef is creative.  The butter fish and hamachi both were great- the rolls were good and the spicy salmon was not heavy on the mayo-  We also tried the tempora and gave this good marks.  The miso was also good. They have Sapporo on tap.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Really 3.5 stars...

Wasn't bad sushi. Decent but definitely a bit on the pricier side. The rolls are slightly smaller. Shared two rolls with the hubby and felt like I wanted more and usually we feel full after 2 rolls. 

We had tried:

- Sushi Couture Maki (*Signature roll): salmon, scallop, tobiko - it typically has spicy mayo, but we asked for no mayo since the other roll had it
- Princess Maki: Spicy Tuna wrapped with Avocado, BBQ Eel, Tuna, and Salmon

Both rolls were delicious, just wish it was slightly bigger!"}
{"text":"Went there with friends on Friday night. The lightly torched rolls were good. The mackerel and hamachi sashimi were good too. The sushi pizza came in segments each in paper cups similar to those for dessert items. Pleasant but not outstanding food. Price was reasonable. The negative was the service. Very slow. Tables were not cleared and it looked messy. The restaurant was perhaps only 2/3 full yet service was still at a snails pace. One final negative there was a mindlessly repetitive discordant soundtrack. That plus the at times loud fellow diners made for a far from enjoyable evening"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner today.
No, I tried to get dinner here today.

As a party of three, we waited for an hour before deciding to leave.
The manager then told us that next time we should let them know in advance if we need to get somewhere.
As if we were supposed to anticipate having to wait an hour? 

There was another couple there and they got their food before us. 
When we asked our server what the heck, he responded by saying they ordered \"simple food\".

Like I mean... Is Chirashi complicated? I don't know maybe I'm missing something.

ANYWAY, go here if you want to wait for an hour before not getting your food- all while sitting there in an environment that smells like sweaty socks. 

Bon Appetit. 

PS It's overpriced."}
{"text":"A bit puzzled by the assertions that this is expensive. I just had a Sushi Couture Maki combo for $13 inc soup, coffee and a dessert cookie (avail until 16:00). Mind you I might end up hungry later... Friendly staff too. Of course as an ex-Brit almost any Toronto restaurant seems very reasonable..."}
{"text":"This is my local sushi place - much, much better than any other sushi spot in the Annex. Prices here are much better than places further south such as Nami and Yuzu. The quality of the food is maybe not exactly as high as Nami, but I'll take it at 60% of the price. 

The fish here is pretty fresh, though it seems slightly less fresh than it was maybe a year ago. They do stuff that's a bit more creative than other places, like using a blow torch to lightly cook the surface of their butterfish. Service is hit or miss, with more misses in my experience. Still, I keep coming back.

I would give this place a 3.5, if only Yelp allowed us to give half stars."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick lunch and Sushi on bloor was packed so my boyfriend and I decided to try Sushi Couture across the street. We were expecting the typical miso soup, salad and lunch menu but instead the lunch special included:

Miso (no surprise there) 

Sushi: it was a weird sushi with tons of creamy dressing.. Way too westernized for my taste. 

COFFEE (what... Is this even a Japanese food restaurant) it was illy so at least it was good coffee. 

And dessert was cheesecake... Like not even Japanese cheesecake.. Just plain cheesecake without the graham cracker base. Tasted decent though just wish there was more to it than cream cheese. 

Service was okay but way too slow. For 2 rolls we waited 45 minutes... We got the coffee and cheesecake to go and they didn't even give me a fork and tissues... 

In total we spent $31 plus tips. Maybe it was just the new lunch combo that was weird because I saw some good reviews on other dishes... But I don't think I would come here again, not a big fan of the awkward western Asian fusion."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've had REALLY good sushi at such great prices. I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about when they say \"bad service\", but when I went with my friend there tonight, they were extremely friendly.

 Okay, so the service was a little slow, but with such good sushi at this price, i'm not complaining. Plus, my friend and I weren't in a rush to go anywhere, and so it wasn't hard to pass the time. But then again, this is the first time I was here, so who knows, maybe I got the good waiters on shift? 

The food was So. Good. The salmon with avocado melted in my mouth. Couldn't get enough of it. If i was downtown more, I'd definitely go as much as possible :D"}
{"text":"As a patron of many of the different sushi places that are in the Annex, my attitude is meh they are all the same. Well this is not the case. I went for lunch with a colleague who has a slightly more adventurous palate then myself. She raved about the more unique rolls, including one with blowtorch seared salmon on top of a spicy almost california roll type of roll. Not wanting to seem too fussy I went with it. Well she gets a huge high five for that. The name of the roll fails me at the moment but it was to die for. 

What sets this place apart from all of the other ones in the 'hood is the attention to detail the staff have for their craft. The fish was fresh and flavorful. They are currently not serving tuna from Japan, but a sign on their window says that a portion of sales will be going to relief. Nice gesture. 

This is the perfect place to take a date when GUU is packed. It's also miles ahead of the more well known sushi places in the area. It stands out because of the quality of food as well.

As for service, it wasn't busy at lunch, our service was perfectly pleasant, as expected at any sushi place. 
Will definitely go back for lunch and or a date."}
{"text":"Fair food but kinda pricey. Good service. Not sure if I'd go back. Toronto has lots of better Japanese food for this price range."}
{"text":"I should preface this review by saying that my 2-star rating was not because I didn't enjoy the sushi. The food was actually, for the most part, quite delicious. 

This establishment was well on it's way to receiving a 4 or 5 star rating from me. The sushi was delectable and they kept the green tea flowing...it wasn't until my Agedashi Tofu arrived that things started going south. Typically, Agedashi Tofu (from my experience anyway) is deep fried tofu served w. a slightly sweet thick sauce on top. However, when they served it to me at Sushi Couture it was covered (and I do mean COVERED) in Bonito flakes. The smell was overwhelmingly awful, everyone at my table looked over to see where the fowl stench was originating from. I quickly asked the waiter if he could kindly remove the dish and bring me another order of Agedashi Tofu sans stinky Bonito flakes (which was not listed as a component of the dish on the menu. They're just a fragrant surprise!). To my shock, he brought the dish back in about 3 seconds flat still with remnants of bonito flakes scattered along the bottom of the plate and stubbornly stuck to some of the tofu pieces. I couldn't believe it! That's seriously poor service in my opinion. I was clear in what I wanted and they chose to lazily ignore my request. 

Good sushi, lousy customer service."}
{"text":"The waiter second guessed my order because I was white and asked if I was sure I knew what Chirashi was. Excuse me I've been to Asia more times than I've done acid and learned to use chopsticks as a teenager in old Hong Kong. Also, my dinner was supposed to include the standard Miso and Typical Sushi Salad with Orange Coloured Dressing. I GOT NO SALAD!! Anddd they did not offer me a miso soup until after I was finished my damn main course!

AND TO TOP IT OFF THE WASHROOMS WERE FILTHY. THE LIGHT DID NOT WORK SO I HAD TO LEAVE THE DOOR AJAR. THEN WHEN I REACHED FOR THE TOILET PAPER THERE WAS NONE AND I HAD TO HOVER IN THE DARK TO GRAB PAPER TOWEL.

And then I am expected to return to my Okcupid date and pretend everything is going on as normal as it should be ?!"}
{"text":"I ended up at Sushi Couture one night to curb my sushi craving. The original plan was to go to New Gen or Sushi on Bloor, but they were both packed - this place had no line and really wasn't that full, which made me slightly nervous, but we decided what the hell and gave it a try. 

I was pleasantly surprised! First of all, I'm a sucker for \"trendy\" decor in a restaurant, it just makes the experience so much better for me - and Sushi Couture definitely has it. Our service was really good, in fact the waiter realized pretty quickly how much water we were going to drink (hey, I like water!) and brought us over a jug, which is soooo much better for everyone involved. 

Everything we ordered was fresh and delicious. It was the kind of sushi that when they bring it to you, you just know it's going to be amazing because it looks like it was made with love! (no, not love, fresh ingredients). 

We had a green dragon roll, spicy salmon and scallop, yam and avocado, and a wakame salad (NOTE: this is big enough for two, which makes the $5 price totalyl reasonable!) and it was all really good. 

I secretly wish this place was a bit cheaper though, some of the rolls were around $11-$12 which is just too much for me - but their descriptions were amazing, so hey maybe they're worth it. 

All in all, I think Sushi Couture may have stolen the role of \"my go-to sushi place on Bloor\"."}
{"text":"There are two types of good sushi restaurants: 1) Very expensive, and very fresh. 2) Very, very cheap, and will not give you food poisoning.

Sushi Couture was iffy. It was quite expensive, but extraordinarily average. It was in that middle zone that we've come to expect with sushi restaurants in Canada, but with a sort-of innovative menu that gives off a more haute cuisine experience than is actually being experienced.

The decor is cheesy, but that shouldn't matter. What did matter was that it was -16 degrees outside, and the heating was broken. We were freezing. 

That said, we did get a complimentary taster dish. I don't know why, but I've gotten a lot of free food in Toronto just for showing up."}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER - This place has 4 star potential but they are having some serious service issues, probably because they have just opened.

Considering they opened last week, they did a good job at rounding up customers. It was a full house tonight. I was surprised. The price point of this sushi joint is moderate and I wasn't sure what the Annex would really think of a slightly more upscale sushi joint.

The main problem was that our order came out staggered and took nearly an hour. I was with 2 others and we each ordered our own rolls. Instead of the food arriving all together, they would bring 1 roll out at a time, about 15 minutes in between each. It made no sense whatsoever. The last roll took so long that we just told the server we didn't want it anymore.

The server could not be found on most occasions, I had to get up twice - once to get soy sauce from another table and a second time to find a clean pair of chopsticks. We couldn't get our tea refilled either until the end of the meal.

Anyway, the good news is, the rolls were all pretty delicious. We tried the butter yaki maki, crunchy maki, sushi couture maki, and green island maki. Portions were small-ish but as the previous reviewer mentions, fish was exceptionally fresh and the rolls came out looking classy. The wasabi was not good and not enough pickled ginger was given.

The server did bring the last roll in a takeaway container for us to have free of charge. I think they are doing their best and I expect service will improve over time.

I expect Sushi Couture will draw the crowd who likes quality fresh stuff and a bit nicer surroundings. But for me, I will revert to Sushi on Bloor or Big Sushi, because I like cheap, copious amounts of sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi Couture deserves allllmost three stars! I usually expect my sushi dinners to be quick and hassle free, but when you have essentially only one person seating and serving a packed restaurant on a Friday night, you will have a problem! To elaborate, our first set of rolls took almost 40 mins to arrive (maybe they forgot?) and by the time the second set arrived, I wasn't very hungry anymore! 

The choices for the rolls aren't as extensive as usual which makes selection a bit easier! The butter yaki maki was excellent and I would say it is probably the best roll at Couture. The spicy tuna was almost too spicy for me and aside from that the rest of the rolls and gyoza were standard! 

So the service almost killed it for me, but on the bright side the space is clean/new and the fish quality and freshness is above the prices charged!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Best sushi in the city at a reasonable price for the quality. Beautiful presentation and attention to detail."}
{"text":"sushi Couture signature roll was delicious, but Udon tasted like little sour. They seemed to use very clean oil for tempura, but tempura was soaked oil too much. I like their scallop on the shell that was very soft and flavourful. Overall, they are quite pricy for the portion and quality of food. I am not sure coming back."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi restaurant in the Annex.  It costs slightly more but the difference is marginal.  The sushi is equivalent to Japango but costs less, and in my opinion, Japango is/was the best sushi in Toronto.  Now I would say they have some stiff competition. (update to this section.  I talked to the waiter at Sushi Couture who I recognized from Japango.  It turns out that he and one of the chefs from Japango came over to work here.  That explains everything! Taste buds don't lie ;)

I saw the other reviews about slow service.  I think they're still trying to iron out the kinks of being a new restaurant, as the service was a little slow, but certainly not terrible.  Very kind people work there and I can tell they're trying their best.

The restaurant itself is very nice, with a classy upscale vibe, which helps to separate it from the other sushi restaurants in the area that have average decor.

If you're looking for great sushi, I highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"In the Annex, there are probably close to five or so \"Japanese\" sushi restaurants that scatter the area from Spadina to Bathurst.  Of all the sushi joints on the block, I can say that Sushi Couture offers the freshest and tastiest fish.  I'm giving Sushi Couture 4 stars just because of the quality of the fish.  When I came back from visiting the West Coast, I was dying for some fresh sashimi that could rival the quality of Vancouver--without spending an arm and a leg, Sushi Couture comes the closest!

For those ol' skool sashimi fans, the Sashimi Dinner offers the an assortment of the daily fresh fish of the day. There is usually always butterfish/whitefish, salmon and tuna.  One thing that the Chef does differently is he sometimes torches the top of the whitefish and adds a dab of garlic oil.  For those ol' skool sashimi fans (like my Dad), this does not go over well.  Sashimi is not supposed to have anything on it except for wasabi and soy sauce.  I do, however, enjoy the torching and garlic sauce, but sometimes the chef adds a little too much garlic oil--when that happens, it's not good.  The Chirashi dinner has a slight garlic oil on the rice.  My ol' skool Dad did not like this and wanted the traditional sushi/chirashi rice.  I like it!...and you will too, if you're willing to bend on the traditional chirashi rice rule :)

All of the dinners come with a bowl of miso soup and a small salad.  The miso is good, not too salty (according to my Japanese miso tastebuds) and the salad has a nice soy based (I think?) base.  The lettuce and veggies in the salad are always fresh.  One other thing that the waiter does is come around to fill up my tea cup.  In Japanese restaurants, you should never have to ask to fill up your tea cup and servers should always make sure that you have tea if you want it.  

Sometimes if you order some sashimi, you could be lucky enough to get some FRESH WASABIIIIIIII!!!!!  This is almost unheard of in Toronto and it is tasty as heck!  I always order the Ikura (large fish eggs) and 95% of the time I get fresh wasabi with it. It's such a treat and it really adds a different taste to the Ikura and to my sashimi.  If you feel lucky, ask the waiter if you can have fresh wasabi...I guarantee you'll think about it every time you use the tube-squeezed-green-dyed generic wasabi that you find in most \"japanese\" sushi restaurants.  By \"japanese\" I really mean...

Of the special maki roles, they are all good! But the ultimate winner on the list is the Sushi Couture maki.  I can't describe what is in it (brain fart), but it's topped with torched white fish and has lots of those little red eggs on top of it.  If you're going to try a role, try to be a little adventurous and steer towards the sushi couture maki and order your California roll or red dragon roll another time. 

Overall, the restaurant is nicely decorated and not overcrowded.  Sometimes the waiters are a tad slow, but they've been getting better each time I see them. Also, don't expect your sushi rolls to come out in 5 minutes like all those pre-made roles that you get with your bento box from the other \"japanese\" restaurants on the block.  Each order is made when you order, so sometimes it takes a little longer than usual. So, although Sushi Couture is not the most authentic Japanese restaurant, they really serve quality fish at a decent price....and with that, I am satisfied!"}
{"text":"Well my friends, with great anticipation did I wait for Sushi couture to open, and how delighted was I to hear the great reviews my fellow yelpers have written about the place, was I ever excited to start off yom kippur by feasting on fresh sushi just around the corner from my place. Well, ill be finishing my dinner off with an amply topped slice from pizzaiola tonight. 

Suffice to say, this place has all the makings of something that could be great, but falls desperately short of anything faintly near a \"great\" sushi restaurant. 

The  service here is horrible, and I give no clemency to the fact that the place has only been open 3 weeks. Seated quick enough, given a half filled glass of warm water to start the night didnt score many points. Miso soup, it was ok, but its miso soup. starter salad, comparably un enchanting. Ive walked by the restaurant countless times and seen the tasting menu special and really wanted to order it but was not really told about it and so thought it was off the menu. maybe thats my fault, either way. 

The food, spicy tuna roll: yes maybe the fish was fresher then sushi on bloor, but it lacked a real zing, if i wanted a taka maki (tuna roll) i would have ordered one, not rolled very well and half of my order fell apart mid chopsticking. Onto the main, I ordered the chirachi as it seemed like an interesting way to combat my typical order of hamachi tako and snapper, boy was i wrong. for 13 you get 2 slivery pieces of maguro, three salmon, three chunky small pieces of what seemed to be seared ahi amd some stupid egg concoction and butter fish (the latter being exceptionally foul). 

They put it on a bed of rice, what the hell am i supposed to do with a bed of oily sushi rice, make the damn sushi my self? A quarter handful of white raddish? wtf. honestly, what the fuck. To top it all off, that took 45 minutes.

 I was left sitting at my table after finishing the spicy tuna with an empty glass of water and an empty plate, albeit being passed by the busboy numerous times. Altogether, I really do hate giving such a low score to what could be a great restaurant, and if you check my record i typically only dole out 4s and 5s. but they really failed on every part, both service and food wise. 

I could have gotten a kings ransom at sushi on bloor or new gen or any of the other places. The decor is nice, but if im bringing a date to a place id like not to wait there for an hour to get the food, i only have 25 minutes of conversation material... STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"Sushi Couture though is a step up from other Sushi joint in the Annex area but when compare to other Japanese restaurants I been to with the same price point, it is not as good or dare I say authentic? 

We did not go for the Omakase menu but opted for the a la carte.. The prices are quite reasonable. 

Beef Teriyaki Dinner ($11.99) comes with miso soup and salad 
- Beef is not the best cut, but for that price, I don't expect much 
- a little chewy and a little overcooked but the waitress never ask how we like the beef cooked... 
- nicely presented and the teriyaki sauce is ok 
- rice has sprinkle of black sesame seeds 

Sashimi Dinner ($15.99) come with miso soup and salad 
-There are 16 pieces of fishes and nicely presented 
- The only concern I have is out of the 16 pieces, only 7 of them 5 piece of Salmon and 2 piece of Hamachi not seared or with no sauce on them? 
- OK I am here on a Sunday night and using the blow torch techniques and a light sauce of top does cover the original freshness taste 

Sushi Couture Maki ($10.99) 
- The best order of the night! 
- Scallops lightly seared with a smokey taste.. melt in the mouth tenderness 
- The roll were cut into pieces that were too small... less than bite size 
- the sauce is nicely balanced and has good flavour 

Uni Sushi ($8.50) 2 pieces 
- Fresh and buttery... such strong taste! 
- so small! :) little little uni... 

Black Seasame Ice Cream ($3.99) 
- stored bought.. standard 
- took 15 minutes to arrive!!! I will definitely skip that next time! 

The 2 sushi chefs and the kitchen staffs are all Chinese speaking. I heard them talking to each other in Cantonese. So the verdict is: if you only eat at Japanese owned/chef restaurant, Sushi Couture is not the one to come to.

There is something definitely lacking in the presentation, the taste and the spirt in Sushi Couture for them to be a really top notch Japanese restaurant! 

They accepts Visa and Mastercard only!"}
{"text":"Annex is filled with endless sushi restaurants. Sushi Couture is definitely on top of the list for their lunch special ($6.95). You have the option of selecting main and a side from either the sushi bar or the kitchen, with miso soup and drink. For an additional $2, specialty rolls can be ordered. The original price of certain specialty rolls cost more than the lunch special.

Hands down, it is the best value for suhi lunch in the area. Everything was fresh. Service was great (aside from the server accidentally spilling hot water on my foot). Nom nom happy at Sushi Couture!"}
{"text":"I had to have sushi last night.  We hit a few other sushi spots, but there were line ups.  Prob. the sushi there was good, but we wanted pronto service and pronto food, so we ended up at Sushi Couture.  Prices there seemed to be the going rate.

The place was almost all full, but we managed to get seated right near the front in no time.  I ordered one miso soup ($1.00, good but salty); one veg maki (6 pieces, $3.99); partook in my fella's grilled eggplant (gross, SKIP this one, about $4.00); and one serving of Inari sushi* (unless you're just getting out of prison and have been craving inari since slammer-time, SKIP their overpriced Inari -- at $3.50 for two SMALL pieces, I actually felt insulted by their limited portion size).  *You can get a better idea of how small they are by checking out the pics that I'm going to upload right after I post this review.
All pickled ginger that came with the sushi was white not pink in colour.  I like that b/c I prefer the idea of avoiding red/any dye in my diet.

Service was more than alright.  We had this young 20-something Japanese server who schooled us on something relatig to the Japanese language and even natto.  I've lived in Japan, and never knew that stinky-but-loved-by-some natto beans originated from the northern part of Japan (an area called Niko).  He chatted a wee bit with us, but then left each time before we could even associate him w/ the idea of overstaying his spot.
What's interesting is that we had more than one server.  Two different servers kept an eye on who needed more water (during their idle time), we had others come in from the back of the restaurant to bring us some of the food orders.  Hey, nothing wrong with not waiting too long for food.  :)

Not everyone was Japanese, one of the three sushi chefs was Korean, the other was possibly Chinese.  Still, the sushi arrived well rolled (that's one sign of good sushi, no?)

Nice setting, but beware of fingerprints on your dishes.  Not a big deal, just ask for another set and the server will MAKE SURE that your next set of dishes arrive definitely CLEAN.

Would we come again?  We'd be open to it.  Thing is, I'm also curious about some of the other sushi hot spots on Bloor... So eventually, I do see us being back..."}
{"text":"The best sushi restaurant on Bloor St. Stands out among the competition for fresh fish, wonderful service, nice decor, and inventive menu. Ken, the owner is the  sushi chef and it shows in his care and attentiveness. We are always warmly greeted. And the restaurant is MSG-free, except for soy sauce -- but on request they weill serve MSF-free soy sauce."}
{"text":"Sushi Couture has to be the best sushi place in the Annex. 

Walking past on our way to our go-to sushi place across the street, we saw the Sushi Couture sign (look past the font, we're glad we did) and decided to try it out after quickly scanning yelp reviews on my iPhone (oh, the many eating disasters averted because of the iPhone). 

Walking in, we waited in line before we were seated. We got our menu and tea promptly and after looking at the menu we decided on edamame, spider roll, unagi eel roll (forgot the actual name) and chirashi dinner. 

The edamame were plump and perfectly seasoned (not too salty). The spider roll was delicious- the crab was plump and delightfully crispy and was served warm. The unagi roll had great flavor and the unagi was melt-in-your-mouth. So good. The chirashi dinner was the best part of our meal- the fish was fresh and again, melt-in-your-mouth good. The tuna sashimi was seared on the outside, giving it a wonderful taste and texture. The rice was perfectly seasoned with a good sweet to slightly sour blend. The salad and miso soup were standard-good but not great.

The prices were very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food ($45 including tax and tip for 2 people). I would definitely pay the extra $5 than go to the other sushi places in the area.

I can't wait to go back and try the sushi couture roll!"}
