{"text":"Grabba Green is a worthy guilt free splurge. Great atmosphere, friendly team. The smoothies are the real deal, and come loaded with fresh, colorful ingredients. The juices are 100%. I enjoy the premade elixirs they have available.  Always feel invigorated after leaving. The pricing is fair and comparable to competitors Who offer the  level of freshness you are getting."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it is good (I wouldn't go so far as to say great). The downside is that it is crazy busy at lunchtime and there are very few places to sit so unless you are getting takeout you may have to stand at the long counters near the bathroom to eat (which could have high chairs but don't). Also, it is definitely overpriced. Ten dollars is just too much for the lunch portion you get. If it was $7 or $8 I wouldn't feel so ripped off and would be more likely to return. I probably won't be back. I just don't think it's that fantastic to make it worth the price."}
{"text":"Got the Gulf of Mexico salad which was tasty.  However the shrimp in the salad were not deveined.  When I brought it to the staff attention they explained they get the shrimp prepared from an outside source. Well obviously no quality control  but the salad it self was good but for $10 I expect the shrimp to be deveined."}
{"text":"DO NOT go here if you have Celiac disease or are allergic to gluten! I have been in here a few times and was very excited to find a new place that is supposedly 100% gluten-free right near where i live. Only problem is, this place is NOT 100% gluten free like they have posted all over their menu and walls. The first couple of times I went in for lunch the food was good. I noticed that they had oats as a breakfast item and mentioned my excitement to the girl taking my order, she confidently told me that everything in the store was 100% gluten free including the organic steel cut oats. I ordered the oats yesterday morning and for the rest of the day I had to sit by the toilet and was forced to leave work early. I called the store and asked them about it and sure enough, the girl on the phone told me that the oats were gluten free, but not certified gluten free (In other words, THEY ARE NOT GLUTEN FREE). This should be against the law to falsely advertise the restaurant as gluten free (100% gluten free listed right on the menu) when it is not. I am about ready to sue. I WILL NOT be back to Grabbagreen, and I hope you will stop serving gluten in your store or at least remove the label that says 100% gluten free so no one else has to experience what I went through."}
{"text":"Awesome food and quick friendly service.  New favorite lunch spot for a healthy and delicious meal.  I like to order online, so my order is ready when I get there.  Convenient to take back to work and could eat lunch here everyday."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for lunch today, overall good experience! I had the southwest and my boyfriend had the patagonia. The patagonia was a little bland, but mine was good! 

Also, if you are watching calories be mindful of the grains, I was surprised when I saw how many my meal had! I definitely want to go back a get one of their juices!"}
{"text":"I go to this place on a regular basis.  Absolutely love it, nothing there that I haven't liked.  The menu is a great concept, offers a lot of variety of choices but also VERY healthy and clean and it allows you to have fun with it and create different combinations and see what you come up with if you choose to \"make your own\".  I have had the quinoa a number of times but usually get a smoothie.  

The service there, in my experience has always been fast and friendly and consistently great!

I highly recommend to anyone who is not just vegan or vegetarian, which I am not, but to anyone who is health conscious and willing to spend a couple extra bucks to put something nutritious into their body!"}
{"text":"Make sure to check your order before taking it to go. I have had a wrong order multiple times where there's ingredients I specifically asked to not have due to allergies. Therefore the food is inedible and by the time I get all the way home 20 minutes away I don't have time to go back and get it fixed. SUPER ANNOYING"}
{"text":"After working here I changed my entire lifestyle in healthy eating. This is such a great place to learn about health and the people I worked with treated me like family. Ethan (manager) is the nicest and sweetest guy I ever had for a manager at any job. Totally cared so much about me, his customers and his employees. 

I lost 15 pounds working here and my skin looked amazing. Everyone is up-beat and very personable. Love love love the salads. Favorite smoothie is the Vita Vamp! Talk about healthy food! Your skin, hair and body will feel better eating here. 

This place really helped me to eat healthier and everyone is very supportive in your health. 

Recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great concept, great customer service, unfortunately if you're looking for an ORGANIC NON-GMO....their menu will trick you. They have a very limited  list of organic items, but not the potential they could have. Its really too bad its not an all organic kitchen, because even greens and fruit are harmful to everyone  if it contains GMOS.  Just a food for thought to every restaurant  owners... IF PICAZZOS ITALIAN AND CHIPOTLE MEXICAN can have NO GMOs... THEN ALL OF YOU CAN !"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Not sure why I haven't eaten here before but the quinoa bowl with steak was delicous.  Fresh ingredients,  friendly staff,  I saw about 10 things I wanted to try.   Prices are very good for scottsdale.  Can't wait to go back. If you're looking for healthy options at a good price i highly recommend."}
{"text":"So i ran into this while on lunch and was excited to see a fresh juice spot. Been juicing for a lil under a week so i had an idea on what to expect. I was not disappointed! I did the create your own and ordered, cucumber & kale with bananas & coconut, along with the whey protein & something else but cant remember. Just know that it was delicious!! For $7 i was not disappointed in the amount i got. Its a tall cup, i think about 8-10 ozs. I will be coming back. Also the food options sounded great as well."}
{"text":"I love this place ! I have never had a bad experience. Food is always fresh and delicious. I do not feel it is overpriced at all because you have to pay for quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Yum! Fresh and healthy choices. Love their juices and smoothies as well as The \"Tokyo bay\". salmon mixed with brown rice, edamame, cucumber, carots, miso ginger"}
{"text":"I dig it here. Best thing is ordering online. When I walk in to pick up my lunch I am helped immediately!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Healthy and delicious! I feel so good after eating here. My favorite thing to get is the make your own bowl with quinoa, spinach, bean sprouts, feta cheese, avocado, salmon, and chimichurri sauce. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I've tried a variety of the salads, bowls, and shakes - every single one I've tried I've loved. Everything is always super fresh.

On top of that they make great cookies, bars, and granola that you can buy in packs to take home. 

Their order ahead app is super helpful, I order off of it at least once a week on my way to work. 

If you have time to sit down and eat they have some nice outdoor tables as well as indoor you can sit back and relax."}
{"text":"Healthy, organic and locally grown! I got the Tokyo salad and it was good. I've seen reviews on here that said service was slow. But if you watch them make the food, it's not something they whip up. They are steaming, boiling each dish. As well as making the juices per order. If you are looking for fast service go to Mc Donald's. I know their drive thru is super quick. I wish they would open one here in Desert Ridge, maybe on High Street?! I would go there everyday!!"}
{"text":"had an amazing meal here today; brown rice, shrimp, avocado, broccoli, cucumber, tomato, carrot, cilantro,balsamic flax and a banana mango smoothie with orange juice. so good! definitely would recommend if your looking for something healthy and filling"}
{"text":"Great customer service and friendly staff! Delicious healthy options as well!! This will definitely be q good to restaurant for me as a quick healthy bite to eat."}
{"text":"Welcome to my new addiction. UGH! I went in today based on a friends recommendation. At first glance, the menu is a tad overwhelming. I looked it over and then once at the register, I asked for a few of their most popular items. One of the items recommended was The South Beach. Looked good to me. (I held the feta and added chicken). I was surprised to see it come in a \"to go\" box but....whatever.  I grabbed a fork and dug in. OMG! DELISH! I immediately grabbed a menu so I could decide what I was going to get tomorrow! 
Seriously, I can't wait to go back.  The food is a little pricey but when you consider most items are organic...you're going to pay more which I'm OK with.  If iceburg lettuce and Ranch is your thang, don't go. If you are into whole, hearty, healthy, green food....this is your place. .TRY IT! 
(BTW...love the ipad POS!)"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a healthy fast food place in my area for such a long time.  I went here for the first time this morning and ended up going back again for dinner.  They have acai bowls (which no one else in the area has), so I'll probably be back from breakfast.  

OPEN ONE UP IN GRAYHAWK, I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"We brought our 20% off coupon and only got 10% for some reason. Register guy was new but guy who entered the coupon in was definitely a pro and must have figured we'd just get 10 instead of 20%. We'll be back to a Grabbagreen, just not this one."}
{"text":"A place has to be pretty bad for me to take the time to do this. This place is the biggest waste of money. I asked for the greenest pure juice they have. I was told to pick 4 vegetables- I chose kale, spinach, carrots, and celery. After waiting a ridiculously long time- I was served a half cup of carrot juice. The portion size is too small to fit the proper amount of greens and get a satisfying size of juice. You can get much more juice (and greens), better service, for less money at Wholefoods or another juice bar.  I expressed my amazement and dissatisfaction when they handed me my juice and was basically told, this is just how it is. I paid $20 for 3 drinks that were basically two big sips of carrot juice. This place is a rip-off. Don't waste your time or money. I went to Wholefoods after for a real green juice."}
{"text":"I've been drinking green smoothies for years now. I tried the green with pear and hemp. It was super watery and not worth the 8 bucks. Stick with whole foods juice bar or nekter. It was cute inside."}
{"text":"Mmm. I might consider myself to be health-conscious, so for all those of you who might be watching not necessarily your weight, but the ingredients you are consuming, this place is pretty nice! I absolutely adore the way they show you every single part of each dish in the description, and also how you can even choose your own ingredients. The downsides are the price, which is pretty high, and also the fact that not all of their ingredients are organic. Maybe I'm just being extremely picky, but I feel like a place with a name like \"Grabbagreen\" would use all organic products. I mean, I'm not that person who only eats organic things, it's just that this sort of restaurant should have organic ingredients. Besides that and the price, though, it's incredibly delicious, healthy, and pretty quick, with great service."}
{"text":"My new favorite smoothie and juice spot! This place has so many healthy and tasty options! My favorite smoothie is the Goji Go Go! The service is good and the place is cute and very clean. The smoothies are pricey, but worth the price to me because I know it is more expensive trying to eat healthy!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch, here today... Wow... Great food, great service, great value... The indochin grabbagrain rocks the house!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing portion sizes and bland food."}
{"text":"I was very excited to come and try out this new healthy restaurant. I was very unsatisfied with the portion size and price. The flavors of the salad were very good but for $11 I would have hoped for a bigger meal. I have not tried the juices yet, but they too run pretty price at $7 each."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and quit good.  I'll go back.  Although I think it's expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"If ever a place SCREAMED go away... high prices, lack of seating, and repulsive (look small) cardboard box serving containers...  That's the bad. 
The GOOD is that the box is quite misconceiving as there is a lot of food packed into this little box AND the food is quite good ... too bad as I won't be back because of the 3 HUGE reasons I don't like the place. 
There are SO MANY grab and go, choices out there, leading with organic & healthy eating with wonderful ambiance, comfortable seating, eco friendly plates or the large recyclable bowls with clear tops, with much better pricing. 
TOO BAD... I really wanted to like this place..."}
{"text":"While visiting Scottsdale on business, I was circling parking lots to find something I could eat before a business meeting that meets my dietary restrictions due to food allergies, primarily wheat/gluten and vinegar.  This can often be a challenge when looking for a quick bite.

Fortunately I ran across GrabbaGreen.  I was starving so I went for both a bowl and a juice.  I generally grab quick lunches at Whole Foods or Central Market salad bars, which can add up real quick when paying by the ounce, so I thought this meal was good value.

I went the creative route building both my bowl and drink from the extensive list of ingredients.  The biggest surprise was to see Moroccan Harissa  as a sauce option.  I love spicy things and Harissa is one of my favorite vinegar free condiments.  While my choices were brave (noodles, spinach, peppers, pistachios, feta) the bowl turned out awesome and was very filling.

The juice menu was extensive, and my chaotic choices for a customize juice blend turned out equally impressive.  The service was also fantastic.

The result, I had a great meal, and felt great afterwards with no food allergy induced food hangover.  I wish this was an option in all the cities I travel to for business."}
{"text":"I discovered this place while visiting Scottsdale.  After several days of not being able to eat almost anything, I stumbled across Grabagreen.  I have to tell you, I loved it!  They have such a great variety of offerings.  I literally went back three more times in the next two days.  The smoothies and the breakfasts that I had were wonderful.  I just wish we had one in Colorado."}
{"text":"Great concept! Look forward to more and more organic choices. Also, please consider getting rid of the styrofoam cups and going with a more 'green' option."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed my \"Tokyo\" selection. For me, it needed something with flavor.  Perhaps lemon or hmmm...not sure.  The texture seemed a bit \"mushy\" for me as everything was steamed.  Healthy, sure, tasty...the jury is still out and they might be a while!

 I will try this place again and hope I enjoy my choice much better.

The smoothie was really good and if I could, I would have tried each one.  Thinking about it now and must have another.  Yes, they are good."}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed...slow service...very bland without a lot of seasoning...overpriced... I was looking for a great healthy option to add to my dining rotation...looks like I'm still looking"}
{"text":"I eat here a lot.  Food is great, employees are nice enough.  Ingredients are the best.  Delicious menu choices.  It would have gotten a 5 star, but a few times I've found things in my food.  Once I found a strand of hair and once a sticker label.  Both, unfortunate ,but I still eat here a lot."}
{"text":"My office decided to order in for lunch. They decided on GrabbaGreen. 

They do have alot of choices to choose from, even create your own options. However I was not at all impressed with the quality. The food is already prepared, and when you make an order they just grab from the salad bar and shove them into your box. I will say the amount of food they fit into the boxes is quite impressive. 

For my protein I ordered Chicken, It was extremely dry and over cooked, for 10 dollars a box i would have expected better."}
{"text":"Holy crap!  Just spent $30 on 4 smoothies/juices that were terrible!  Tasteless and bland.  I know what \"healthy\" tastes like and could've gotten better options at Whole Foods.  Extremely disappointed.  Not sure if their food is any better, but for what I paid for, I feel like I was definitely taken for a sucker.  It's been a very long time since I've been this disappointed and upset about a food and drink experience."}
{"text":"I stopped in the other day and had the most delicious quinoa noodle, veggie, and chicken dish. I was so happy with it, I am going back again tomorrow to try something else. I would highly recommend. The staff is friendly, the decor is nice and the menu is extensive. I love how they put the food in chinese take-out boxes. Please open one in North Central Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I go here often and get the salads mostly. The Orange County is my favorite. They stuff the box full of vegetables and I usually take it to go home and dump it in a big bowl and eat it. I made the mistake of trying a similar place with the same type of food. Big mistake. I think portions here are great. Also, all of the nutritional information is available on their website."}
{"text":"Paid an outrageous $11.50 for an Orange County salad w/ black beans that tasted like what one might find in the grass catcher bag of a lawnmower. Whatever salad dressing there was had little flavor. Take your money to Pita Jungle or Flower Child if you're looking for a tastier and more reasonably priced vegan meal with better ambiance and presentation."}
{"text":"This new business is WONDERFUL.  We are vegans and looking for a place to have healthy food out, this more than met that desire. Staff were super nice, VERY welcoming.  The food was delicious.  Whether you are committed to a plant based diet, gluten free diet or just want to feed your body something good, this is your ticket!!!  I would give it 10  stars, if I could.  Wish Grabbagreens  were as plentiful as McDonalds!!!"}
{"text":"Walking by one night during close with my friends, I was telling them how great this place was- to which I immediately retracted my statement as I watched 2 girls standing around and drinking DIRECTLY out of the smoothie containers. It was humorous reading the big sign saying, \"CLEAN EATING\"... With the glass background of the shift manager and the employee slurping down from the same container the customers are served. Quite a disgusting sight to see... Making the owners real proud ladies."}
{"text":"Love it! Best salad to go place in town! The kids menu is a perfect size for little guys!"}
{"text":"I came across this place while looking for a late lunch between appointments today, when I found that the Whole Foods I thought was in the area had closed. I got a Power greens juice with a double shot of wheat grass juice on the side. The owner/manager Kelley was friendly, hospitable and helpful. Fair prices and many options for fresh juices, smoothies and food.

The organics are all labeled, everything was gluten free and the selection was vast. The 2 oz wheat grass juice was $4 (ouch!) but worth it. Had a great conversation with Kelley and another regular customer about great food documentaries (Forks Over Knives, Footmatters, Hungry For Change, Fat Sick & Nearly Dead). I'll come back to this place whenever in the area!"}
{"text":"My review is only on their Acai Bowls, which is NOT real acai bowls. It is basically a acai smoothie with the various toppings. I watched them pour in acai juice into the blender with banana and ice...when in other places they blend pure frozen acai puree resulting in rich purple color and taste of acai. What I got was just a diluted acai juice smoothie. They also serve it up in a cup rather than a bowl. Needless to say, it was a disappointment and a waste of money for $7."}
{"text":"Friendly service but food is blah. I'm a huge salad lover and hard to displease with a salad but this one was flavorless and expensive for what it was!"}
{"text":"I can only comment on their smoothies, which have all been very good (and healthy).

This place is not for you if you're not looking for healthy/real food. 

If they dropped their prices 10-15% on the smoothies I would feel better about going there more often (and giving them 5 stars)."}
{"text":"Went in about a week ago for my first time and picked up a smoothie. Service was great, made it fairly quick and it was really enjoyable. Went in again yesterday, this time trying the food for lunch. I ordered a \"Build your own\" with avocado, chicken, rice, beans, peppers and more. Lets just leave it at \"Amazing.\" I will definitely be there again!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. LOVE the concept of the \"build-your-own\" box and food was tasty and fresh, but do agree with many other reviewers that it is just a bit too pricey for what you get. I think $7.99 would be a good price point that would make me want to return frequently."}
{"text":"This place is  a favorite with the folks at my office. We must order lunch, for pick up, from them at least three days a week. The \"make your own\" is the best for mixing and matching healthy food items.  Only downside is that there are long lines/waiting right at lunch time. We now call in and prepay before driving over to pick up."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, great flavor, friendly service!  Just a bit expensive at $10.50 for each box of salad.

I love the Gangham salad! This visit my bf had the On the Border salad. Both are very yummy.

Previous visit, had a carrot juice which was yummy, but for $8, that was the first and last time for that.

There are many choices for salads & healthy eating that are not as expensive so we tend to go to those other places more. However, when I'm craving the Gangham Salad with the steak, brown rice and chia seeds, we splurge and come here."}
{"text":"Great place to get fast healthy food, but I do hate how all the bowls are the same price. We ordered the Toyko Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. The Tokyo Bay was worth the $10 because it was delicious, fulfilling, and had salmon. The Gulf of Mexico was just an overpriced Spinach salad and it was bland. My advice is to read the ingredients carefully and make sure you're getting your money's worth!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good for a grab and go healthy restaurant. I love the moroccan Mac and cheese and some of their protein cookies!"}
{"text":"I saw a review picture that said, \"No Sauce. Dry Chicken\".....?
I don't get the picture, but I think the customer misunderstood the concept.
THIS IS HEALTHY FOOD.
I love it here, I eat a small meal (Im sure that's been said too) and Im full for the rest of the day, and Im a guy who loves to eat.

TIP OF THE DAY -------- ORDER ONLINE, ORDER ONLINE, ORDER ONLINE!!!!
unless you have plenty of time to hang out, this is NOT fast food, it takes them restaurant time to prepare your dish (or box if you will), but it is worth the wait.

And if you are a juice or smoothie person, UR in ZEN!!! 

I didn't really get it at first, (the flavor), but now I am a fan.

Feel Better, Live Better! as my Friend Dr. Joe always says...LOL"}
{"text":"Grabbagreen, where do I begin.... everything I have tried here is amazing, and the place itself is clean! My go to order is the Energy Elevator smoothie which leaves me feeling satisfied and healthy. The only downside to Grabbagreen is the extremely expensive prices for what it is:( I could buy a meal for the price of a single juice/smoothie."}
{"text":"I see what they are trying to do and I can appreciate it. There aren't a ton of truly healthy options around here that don't cost a pretty penny. I will give them credit for having more options such as quinoa and allowing you to build your own bowl/salad. 

But, for $10, I would expect better, bolder flavor. **Edit, I had posted about the legitimacy of the proteins being fresh, and the owner had messaged me. They use a steaming method to avoid any oils in the cooking process, which is healthy but unfortunately leaves the dishes a bit bland.*** The veggies they use are also simply steamed. It couldn't hurt to use some actual herbs and seasoning. 

This place is just a little overpriced for the lackluster flavor. They do source their ingredients from conscious/organic farms -- but I just wish they'd work on the presentation/taste."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place in my search for a kale salad for lunch. Place has a very healthy feel as you walk in (not my first thing when looking for food) but I decided to give it a shot. Menu looked appealing to what I was craving. Line was quick, staff was was SUPER friendly. She guided me through my virgin order. Got the Gangam city salad. Normally I read reviews before I try a place but was so hungry I ordered then sat to wait while I read reviews. I was worried as I read some of the lower scored reviews. I got my food and was delightfully surprised! It had ample ingredients, great flavor, plenty of dressing, and didn't take ages to get out to me. I  very pleased with my lunch choice and will be back!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did. I was so excited to try it out...they make meals like I do at home. My mantra is Grain-Protein-Fat-Green. It is what I do.

So first we encounter the bored girl at the cash register who really wanted to be anywhere but there. She swayed when she waited, her cat eyeliner made her boredom look arrogant & she couldn't wait to get our order taken so she could move on.

The area is cramped. It's still summer so eating inside is appreciated. We had women sitting at tables waiting for to-go orders & single men taking 4 tops. The rudeness in the patrons was personified doubly in the employees.

I truly believe it must suck to work there & that's why it's so hard for everyone to smile. NO ONE SMILED. Everyone looked like they were being judged constantly by the middle-aged, blonde-ponytailed woman behind the counter. They looked like they hated their jobs. And frankly, it made it feel weird & I wanted to leave. Like I had been invited to a dinner party where the hosts had JUST had a huge blowout fight before I arrived. Awkward tension.

So cat-eye girl wanted my husbands last initial because there were two \"John's\". So he gives her D. When they finally call our order they call \"John\" & two Johns stand up because the necessary D had been lost in communication. 

The food is bland. They offer some really great sounding sauces but as a green-eater myself I know a cup of spinach is drying to the mouth so maybe I would've done better to choose another green, or maybe when they use spinach they should make some allowances for the taste in their measurements.
My husband DID like his however, he did not have spinach.

It's overpriced. I can make the same thing at home for $2 per family member.  I would feel more comfortable paying $7-8 than $10. It feels like I have to be exploited because I like to eat organically. NO I DON'T!!

Now is it an awesome idea? YES! Do they offer a semi-quick healthy lunch alternative? YES! Would I go back? NO!!!"}
{"text":"Three words for ya..... A MA ZING!!!!!!!
I didn't know what to expect when I tried it, but I'm hooked!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in late in the afternoon craving a healthy juice pick-me-up.
I ordered the Detox Juice in the smaller size, I opted for no ice as i assumed I would get more juice. 
The portion was so small!! For a total of $7 I would expect a bit more juice or use bigger cups and include the ice...

The staff was very friendly and the juice was tasty, but at this price point there are other juice bars I would go to first."}
{"text":"The only bad thing I can say about this place is the price. It is a little pricey, but I still go every week. It is so delicious. I would go with the Southwest. It is my absolute favorite, you can't go wrong. The mango salsa/sriracha sauce they have is so good, I wish they sold it. 

I have had all the juices, I really like the one with beets."}
{"text":"I have seen this place in north Scottsdale several times. So we decided to check it out for dinner. Had the so Southern California that had 
Quinoa Noodle, Chicken, Spinach, Red Pepper, Avocado, Cucumber, Feta, Mint, Balsamic Flax. Can I just say that it was so delicious! Went back for breakfast and never knew that healthy and delicious could be synonymous with eating. If you like healthy eating, this place is what you have been dreaming of. Oh and the app is a great touch if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"I finally re-visited Grabbagreen. Although the owner did not return my call from the prior review, I still found a reason to go in because of convenience. To my surprise and delight, Leslie provided exceptional service, even going above and beyond by honoring discount cards that they were no longer accepting. It really pays to go the extra step. Sometimes we hear more of the bad than good- but in this case I wanted to recognize a job well done."}
{"text":"Seriously my favorite go to place to eat now a days. Ive lost 8 lbs. In 3 weeks. Probably eat here multiple times a week! The girls there are amazing and the owner is super nice. Check it out."}
{"text":"Finally a place to order healthy and FAST food! I got the Tokyo Bay and Pina Protein to share with my kids. My kids got the kids bowls with chicken, rice, and a veggie. All of it was great. My husband got a juice to drink that had kale in it and it was really good as well. We really were happy to find somewhere quick and healthy to bring our kids. They had a really cute short table just for the kids with chairs just their size. We will definitely go again! The only constructive criticism I have is that I hadn't been here before and was overwhelmed with the menu. The guy taking my order seemed annoyed instead of helpful when I asked what was good. The menu was huge so a suggestion or two would have been helpful."}
{"text":"I love having Grabba Green as a snack and lunch option. Last week I really wanted a GOOD smoothie, and Grabba Green was perfect. I enjoyed the \"Feeling Fabulous,\" which is spinach, kale, avocado, cucumber, coconut, lemon, coconut water and honey. Hearty, creamy with a touch of sweetness. 

Previously, I've had the Indochin, which has Rice Noodles, Chicken, Cucumber, Bean Sprouts, Carrots, Green Onion, Cilantro, and a spicy almond sauce."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of juice bars and this is by far the best I have been to. I'm going to be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Not too many places out there that offer genuinely \"fresh\" and healthy ingredients that don't require a sit down & order off a menu hour long lunch meal. But, there is Grabbagreen. Not as \"fast\" as fast food because they prepare your food upon ordering. But it is quick enough to grab on a short lunch break. I had the So Cal grain bowl and it was tasty & filling. (Only ate half) I loves the use of mint & feta in this dish to really give it a pop of flavor! Can't wait to try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"If this place only served salads I would give it a 3. If they only made juices I would give it a 5. For that reason I gave it a 4. This review is solely based on the one salad I got which is the gulf of Mexico salad. The menu says avocado, uh no it's not avocado, its a creamy guacamole without any taste (pet peeve: when restaurants  say avocado and it's that fake creamy guacomole type) the dressing which I'm not sure what it is as the menu didn't make it clear lacks flavor and didn't really complement the other flavors. The juice on the other hand was delicious!!! Tasted fresh! I would definitely consider coming back here and trying the other juices. For the price of the salad I will pass on the salads next time and go for a juice!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I cherish the healthy organic options. It's such a relief to see food and restaurants keep moving in this direction. Way to go Grabbagreen!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great for gluten-free.  Taste great too. I come here often. Groupon helped since it is a bit pricey. That's also why not the 5th star.  But I'll keep coming because it's good and good for you."}
{"text":"I have been in several times since they opened.  I love the idea of feeding my family a healthy lunch and have recommended them to many other moms.   I must have been in right after the managers read the review about their  inconsistent policies.  I ordered my one year old daughter(with severe allergies) her usual.  The cashier was very nervous and said she needed to check with her manager.  The manager came out and rudely told me that they could not make it anymore.  They all decided to be \"consistent\" and that was against their policy to change the kids menu.  She told me I could pay 2.50 to add the noodles.  Seriously?  I thought this place was started by moms that wanted better food options for their kids.  I hope they remember this if it is true.  Seems like it should be such a fun place to work.  Not sure why all employees walk around with their tails between their legs.  Guess if the bosses speak to customers in such a rude manner, their staff must really get it!!  Needless to say, I will no longer be recommending Grabba Green.  

Also, for the cost, did anyone notice they reduced the size of the box the food comes in?  Same price?  Kind of shady!

GO TO TRUE FOODS!!"}
{"text":"My second visit was hit it on the spot.  I feel SO good after dining here.....I mean.. Drinking here... the Juice is quick and filling.  It's high octane fuel for your body and cells.  JUICE GOOD."}
{"text":"Was out running errands and I decided I needed a snack. What better way to beat a HOT day than with a healthy smoothie. Great food was expected but what I received was a lot more. I was greeted with enthusiasm and as I waited for my order I witnessed something unexpected. A staff that clearly loved their job. They were energetic, fun loving and clearly wanted to give their customers the best possible service along with high quality product. It was a pleasure to watch them work. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Fresh food and I like that they added black beans as a protein since I am allergic to soy and I'm vegan. I was also happy that they were able to look at ingredients for me and let me know which sauce did not have garlic. Service is also way friendlier than it used to be. If you like quick and healthy I would recommend them. However very expensive for super small portions. I am hungry 30 min later. Would be 5 stars if portion was bigger."}
{"text":"Really good stuff I love this place! I've visited two different ones and both were equally good. 

I sat for a while at both places and watch people bring little kids in to have a treat. It's nice to see parents changing the way they eat and also passing it down to their children. 

I don't know how long this place has been open but I hope they keep popping up more and more! I believe raw food is the way to go. 
I'm worried about the all timers and dementia epidemic we have going on. 
The Japanese don't have it I think we need more raw food. 
This is a great place to start. If you want to do a detox check this place out. I saw something about them offering detox paying by the day."}
{"text":"We frequently get lunch here for our work group because it's healthy and everyone can eventually find something here. Only 4 stars because about 1/3 of the time they get one or two orders wrong on our order. They have been better recently, but still occasionally mess up, but they always fix whatever was wrong. Overall though, the staff is very friendly and always accommodating to the changes we make to each order."}
{"text":"I'm really excited about this place. This morning was my first time here, but it certainly won't be my last! Great (and surprisingly fast!) service, all organic and fresh ingredients, an enormous menu with plenty of options to customize as you wish, and delicious end products!

I was immediately and politely greeted when I walked through the front door. I decided to order a Power juice and asked if I could get ginger added to the juice. The response was an enthusiastic, \"Absolutely!\". No problem with customization - AWESOME!

I'm actually a bit of a health fanatic, in philosophy if not always in practice. I've spent an awful lot of time preparing organic juices for myself, so I know what goes into it and I appreciate the ability to customize, especially with such a large ingredients list!

I was also (pleasantly!) surprised that my bill for a 12 oz. juice was only about $6 after tax. That's a whole lot of fresh, organic energy for only $6!

The juice arrived quicker than I expected and tasted really good. Not quite as heavy on the greens (spinach and kale, in this case) as I would have gone myself, but I'm always going for body-boost not flavor. The flavor of this juice could appeal to anyone.

I'm really very pleased with the total experience today here at Grabbagreen. They've got the whole Chipotle-build-your-own salad thing going on, which I LOVE; and they even bottle their juices for you fresh, if you like! (Bottled juices sell for $8 - still a deal!)

I'll definitely be back - maybe even for lunch today. I've been meaning to replace my every-morning coffee with something more energizing (and more healthy!), and I think this just might be it.

If you haven't been, stop by sometime soon! Grab a big fresh meal, a smoothie, or a Power juice, then go sit outside in the perfect AZ \"autumn\" weather beside a small bush (like I did). You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Super disappointing! We drove by and I looked it up on yelp to see what people were saying. My phone died pretty quickly so we ran in and gave it a blind try. 
   My 7 year old, who is an extremely healthy eater complained about the smell the second we walked in. The atmosphere just didn't seem to welcoming either. If it is your first time there it seems a little confusing. I ordered the French Quarter, the little man wanted the kids chicken and green, and hubby ordered the Tokyo. 
    Mine was...blah. Just really nothing there. The ingredients were not that fantastic, the flavor was super bland except for the ?cayenne? Which was awful! My sons was literally spinach with little chunks of chicken and some awful BBQ type sauce splashed on it. Why not just call it a salad?  Husbands was bland and underwhelming as well. 
    We all had iced green tea which was super strong brewed and not pleasant at all, pretty bitter. For the price of $35, I would have rather gone to whole foods and bought meals. I definitely wouldn't waste my time or money going back here.
   Oh, to top it off the staff was not very friendly and the two girls at the register didn't know what they were doing and had to keep running and asking someone else."}
{"text":"This place is AMAAAAAZING! I feel so healthy after I eat here. The food is excellent, and the service is timely and welcoming. One employee in particular, I think his name may have been Rob, made my whole experience. I told him what  I was in the mood for, and he pointed me in the right direction. I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is an incredible healthy place to eat where you can build your own meal. The wife and I had different meal and they were outstanding. The \"Grab Your Own\", on the menu is the way to go if you want to build a great low cal or higher protein meal. The taste is great and the staff walk you through all the options.

It is my first choice when out and about and wanting to have a mindful eating experience. I have eaten at the Hayden and Shea locations and both are good."}
{"text":"Grabagreen is a hit! This whole-food, gluten free option was impressive. Basically, you can order a predetermined dish or you can pick your ingredients. I had quinoa, shrimp, avocado, red bell pepper, kale, feta, and the avocado sauce. It was delicious. I also had to try a smoothie. In this case, I went with a pre-listed option: Look Lucious. The flavored were right on. The style of this establishment is quick and easy, order at the counter style. They put your order in a little box regardless so you can eat in or out. It's not very big but there are several outdoor tables too. 

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went in and had a pleasant surprise. People from state farm paid for my meal it was awesome! Aside from that I will be back to try their other food items. I got the steak collard wrap which was light and perfect for a pre workout meal. I also got their PB & J smoothie."}
{"text":"Seriously, this place cannot get any better.  Firstly, the people are AWESOME!!! They took the time to go through the menu with me and to boot, remembered my name from my first visit!  That's some serious customer service and talent.  

On to the shakes, TO DIE FOR!!! So good and so refreshing and tastes beyond amazing.  I absolutely love this place and have been back a good 7 or 8 times since. Beware, you will become addicted."}
{"text":"Extremely flavorless and hard to eat chicken wrap. 
Acai bowl was a joke. I ordered the one with strawberries bananas and blueberry. I got NO strawberries and the acai itself was purple water. 
I eat acai bowls constantly and that is nothing like ACAI. 

Tip: Put more powder in your acai mix, it needs at least double. Sell Acai with granola and condansaded milk as a side option besides the fruits. 
Google ACAI bowls in Brazil. 
Refund unhappy customer, I just wasted $18 of food I will not eat."}
{"text":"This place just gets it right with food quality!  My entire staff at New Serenity Spa eat breakfast, lunch and dinner at grabbagreen.  It is very difficult to find good, quality food on the go and these gals managed to take healthy eating/living possible for on the run people like me.

I recommend both the food and smoothies.  I usually create my own entree but their menu selections are equally good.  

I give high kudos to this business!!  Thank you for opening up a restaurant that can actually benefit our health instead of most fast food restaurants that are loaded with low quality ingredients.  I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Great for smoothes and juice! The atmosphere is awesome and modern. My only complaint is the food could be more flavorful. You can get great flavor and still have a very healthy meal by just adding spices. Overall though a great place."}
{"text":"Grabbagreen is awesome. I haven't tried their food yet, but their juice and smoothie menus are great. A little bit on the more expensive side since they use organic products, but you get a good amount of everything. 

There're a few things I prefer Grabbagreen over other places:
Gluten-free products
Organic content
AND most smoothies and juice are naturally sweet, no sugar added. For a few items that have strong tastes like kale, etc. they only add a little bit of agave, not a whole lot. And that is just so much heathier.

I will definitely come back whenever I come to this area."}
{"text":"What a find! We had an hour to spare before movies commenced! The staff are uber friendly and explain all if first time customer. I don't think I have had fresher food. I opted for the Mediterranean salad and replaced the peppers with broccoli...simply delicious. I had a cucumber ginger and lemon mint juice. This was less delicious but that's purely personal taste. I highly recommend a stop at grabba green!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!!

Loved all the choices!  Loved that they were all organic, fresh, gluten free and super healthy! Love, love, love!

I usually get the \"power\" juice/detox. So good!!!! 

Suggestion: You're business prides themselves on being \"green\" why don't ya change your cups And straws to biodegradable? If you're company is going to be green, BE GREEN! :-)

Also, fyi... if you're on a budget, save up... it isn't cheap. You may get sticker shock and they don't even have a punch card (they used too!! and they keep saying \"something\" will come back, like a new punch card or loyalty card or something) Sooo pricey but ohh so good! I would go more often if it wasn't so expensive. $$$21 dollars for lunch, ouch

KEELY N OF GRABBAGREEN .... I see from other posts you may be the owner or a manager. Can you please clear up where your veggies/fruit for your smoothies come from? Are they organic??"}
{"text":"Being a chef, restaurant consultant and specialize in nutrition this place is a MESS! You are price gouging the consumer with small portions and horrible cooking of the few items you have to cook. I had a salad and coconut water and it was $16!!  The staff couldn't explain a \"perfect protein\" such as quinoa or why it was good for you and the noodles were hard! The storage is off and pressure cooking the meat makes for a bland product. I am sure there were good intentions but I doubt they had a true restaurant person helping them. Keep to juicing. It is less labor and the cost and convenience can be justified."}
{"text":"Good food! But portion for price is kind of high. That's what you get for Scottsdale I guess. But I did enjoy the quinoa noodles. Can't find that anywhere else."}
{"text":"As part of my \"2014 Arizona Health Food tour\" I stopped into grabbagreen a couple months ago after being told about it from a friend. I thought the idea was cool, nothing that hasnt been done a thousand times before in California and a few times here in state, but it boasted a healthy alternative to fast food, and for that I had to give them credit. When I stepped inside in the later lunch hours the place was packed so I thought \"well good for them, maybe this is the real deal.\" I was wrong, after ordering a Southwest Grain bowl recommended to me by the less than enthused girl at the counter, and a \"Power Juice\", I took a seat outside for lack of indoor seating and tight quarters just arent my thing. somewhere around ten minutes later my room temperature food and juice came out, as soon as I opened the box I was underwhelmed with the presentation, a bunch of mush beneath a layer of weird colored sauce. Presentation isnt everything, so I dug in. foul. The blend of textures wasnt very appealing, the sauce was a bit much, but something had to help mask the bland food and disgusting breast meat chicken(?) that was so dry in almost just crumbled in my mouth without having to chew. I swore at this moment I'd never eat at one of these establishments again, a ten dollar box of nothing that clearly gained its following by telling people that its gluten free and \"mostly organic\". All hope was not lost though, I still had my juice. I am person that juices at home, so upon taking the first sip of this juice something is wrong, its an 8 dollar apple juice with a hint of kale, spinach and lemon. The experience was overall pretty awful, but upon doing some research I learned there was a second location that wasnt as busy, I saw this as a chance to give it another go doing a little deeper research(keep your eyes peeled for my review of their other location) I know first hand that sometimes one restaurant location doesnt do the brand justice. I would love to see this place keep doing well, but I think eventually people will catch on that they are paying a lot for a less than spectacular health food experience that swears they are your only option."}
{"text":"I come to Phoenix on business and I make this my morning breakfast stop.  The oat smoothie always taste great and fresh.  This place can be a little pricey however."}
{"text":"I recently started working in the Pinnacle Peak & Pima area and generally prefer to eat lunch from home. I have celiac disease, and finding a quick, reasonably priced, and desirable lunch option is difficult. It's almost like pick two of the above needs- I almost never meet all three.

That said, I happened across a coupon for $2 off my next meal here at Grabbagreen. I pulled up the menu online and was a little annoyed to see that they labeled everything that was vegan or vegetarian, but nothing was labeled gluten free. I also couldn't find allergen information on the menu. Just as I'm about to give up and label this place as a bust for my needs, I finally see the beautiful words, \"Our menu is gluten free\". Not \"We have a gluten free menu\", or even worse \"We have a gluten free friendly menu\". THE ENTIRE GRABBAGREEN MENU IS GLUTEN FREE.

Understand that this is a big deal for celiacs. Never in the history of ever has a restaurant given me so many options with no change of cross contamination. JACKPOT!

I ordered the French Quarter without red pepper. The shrimp are actually a reasonable size, and considering this is a $10 meal I am impressed by the quality of shrimp used. My only complaint on this bowl was that it was flat out overloaded by onions... I had to pick most of them out because I couldn't even chew a bite without crying from onion issues. NExt time I'll specify light onions, but the quality of their ingredients is awesome. Super fresh spinach, and some of the most flavorful avocados I've had since I defected from California

I plan on returning regularly and will be posting a fully detailed review on my own personal site."}
{"text":"I've tried just about every smoothie available on the menu and I haven't had anything I can honestly say wasn't good, refreshing or delicious (usually a combination of all three).

My fav to try would be the energy elevator, which has espresso, whey proteing, almond milk, cocoa and a few other goodies I can't remember right now.  Taste like an espresso drink with a hint of chocolate.  Not sweet at all but a subtle taste that is in the background.  

So far have only had hash bowl and veggie bowl.  Both very healthy and what I found to be delicious as well.  Now one has to remember that the veggie hash bowl is all about the veggies and kale, so you might want to ask for extra creamy avocado for a bit more wetness.

Haven't tried all their other items yet, but can't imagine them not delivering the same good quality that my sampling has.

And finally......keep in mind this is all about freshness, no preservatives, and natural ingredients.  It won'be be like a Starbucks caramel fattachino or the store brought smoothies that are loaded with sugar."}
{"text":"I had the immunization station and it was delicious.  Kept me full for quite a long time.  Spendy though."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a healthy, organic meal, this has to be on your radar. Quick and easy with great flavors. My favorites are the Gulf of Mexico salad and the South Beach salad. The protein bars are also a great snack. Little pricey but you get what you pay for and you are paying to NOT have pesticides and harmful chemicals here."}
{"text":"I agree with Emina. Small sloppy portion for $10. Add protein ( chicken, etc... ) your up to almost $15.  I don't mind spending the $ when it is worth it.  I've spent $10 alone on a smoothie in the past from another establishment.   Overall poor value."}
{"text":"First time in today.  I chose Southwest Grain: Quinoa (OPTED for BROWN RICE INSTEAD), Chicken, Corn, Black Bean, Tomato, Avocado, Cheddar-Jack, Cilantro, Yogurt Agave BBQ....it was good.  Full if flavor. Nice portion. $10.00 +. Went in for lunch just minutes before noon. Filled up quick.  If I go back I may stick to this dish. I will try juice next time for sure - prices seemed high on those."}
{"text":"I'm usually a huge fan of this place.  I used to go to the FLW location since it was closest to me, but I have switched jobs and the Shea location is much closer for me to grab lunch on my break.  I usually get the Power PBJ smoothie with almond butter, but the last 2 times they were AWFUL and inconsistent!  They've been very watery, bland and with large chunks of almonds in every sip :(  At $8 a drink, I haven't been happy.

They certainly seem short staffed as of late and I have waited for almost 20 minutes for my smoothie (the only person in line).  Something is \"off\" with their shop and the quality of recipes, so I guess I'll either go to the FLW location and drive out of my way or just stop in next door at One Stop Nutrition and spend a little less.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Was in Scottsdale for four days for a conference and came here twice. Loved having a healthy yet affordable option for lunch and dinner. Enjoyed rice bowls and freshly made juices on both visits. Wish we had a place like this in my hometown!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite location! Nick and Cheridan always remember my name and just how I like my order. I think the food is even better here. My favorite lunch spot and super healthy too!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite lunch spot. 

Now I'm not a vegetarian or health nut by any definition of the word but this place is delicious. 

I love their smoothies. I tend to customize my own, but I love the Feeling Fabulous. The coconut water really makes it. 

From the GrabbaGrain menu I looooooove the Moroccan Mac and Cheese (with chicken!) and The French Quarter. 

If I was independently wealthy I'd eat here three meals a day."}
{"text":"Where do I start? I recently moved into the neighborhood  and was extremely excited when I noticed this place. I love a quick healthy option and this seemed perfect. Well, far from it. One evening I decided to try it out, checked their hours on the website to be sure they were open it was 8:30p and their site stated they closed at 9:00p. Awesome. When I got there 10 minutes later I walked in to the chairs being stacked up and food being put away. I kindly asked if they were still open to which the 6 employees standing around responded in unison looking around at each other, \"uuuuhhhhhh, uuuummmmm....kinda.\"  So I'm standing at the door like an idiot waiting for someone to say \"of course, we're open until 9:00p, how can I help you?!\" But no, I had to make the first move to say  \"well, sorry to bother you I guess I'll try this some other time\" .  They said bye, GIGGLED, and continued closing up shop early. 

My second attempt was unfortunately forced upon me this afternoon. I'm a medical sales rep and cater several lunches per week and had a request for gluten free meals. Grabba Green came to mind so I placed a phone order. After providing my CC info I made a split second decision to ask for all sauces on the side. The employee became quickly and noticeably exasperated, literally sighing and speaking a million miles a minute telling me she now had to hurry and go tell the cooks that sauce was on the side, to which I APOLOGIZED, just before she hung up on me. I showed up, practically bagged my own food, and left.

If service was better I could see myself using them a couple times a week to cater these lunches (which typically range from 15-50 people and at about $10/meal that would be a nice bit of business for one order). I don't care how great/healthy their food is, the service is horrible and their employees are incredibly rude. If I were the owners I would be livid at the way these kids are representing my business."}
{"text":"This place was SO good! I have a hard time finding good gluten-free, but the whole place is gluten-free!!! I went with the power juice and the hash breakfast bowl, and it was not disappointing! It was so good and fulfilling."}
{"text":"I have visited GG about 10 times since they opened and the only reason is the good healthy food.  The employees are always rude and unfriendly.  So odd in today's business environment.  Everyone likes to be cheerfully greeted and have a pleasant experience.  I thanked the person when my food was delivered to the bar and I didn't get a look or response.   The troubling thing is that this experience has been consistent over the time that the place has been open except for our first visit when the 2 ladies that opened the restaurant were behind the counter."}
{"text":"I wanted to try Grabbagreen again for a healthy dinner.  The young lady who helped me was very helpful and made alot of great suggestions. I ordered the Indochin. A quinoa pasta,chicken and veggie box. I had a slightly spicy sauce on it that was light and not overwhelming. I enjoyed it and want to try other things on the menu.  I'll be back, because like everyone else I'm trying to find places to make healthy choices. :)"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. The guy at the counter taking my order was rude and felt the need to rush me. There was no one behind me and my first time there. Could not give me advice and upset I stepped out of line to look st the menu. I would of purchased more if I had the chance to look. I'll be back bc of the food."}
{"text":"Great place to satisfy an afternoon need for a treat. Smoothie, juice or small dish. I love this place. They just expanded their store to shea and Scottsdale -- making my drive to visit grabba mucho shorter. Perfection. Lady who served me this morning was super nice; which was rare at the other location. Excited!!"}
{"text":"This place is overpriced at best. Ordered an acai bowl and the Acai was watery. I basically paid 8 bucks for fruit. The workers were immersed in their conversation and it took nearly 10 minutes for me to receive such a simple item with only one other customer in the store. They ordered a hot entree in a box which looked somewhat heathy. The portions of that box were measly for the $10+ price they were asking. This place is not organic so I find it hard to justify their high prices for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Good idea, but food is bland and the chicken looks and tastes like it was microwaved or steam cooked....
The worst are the containers-cheap, non-recyclable and covered with a non-stick film or sorts. Even if you eat in you don't get a plate.  The prices are steep, especially for what you get....there are many reasonable options in Scottsdale by now, including healthy ones, so we definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Grabba Green offers some good and healthy lunch options, along with being very convenient. I've had a few lunches here and I really like the online ordering system, it makes for an easy to-go experience. I really enjoy the \"make-your-own\" bowls where you can choose whatever you want to go in it. There's lot's of fresh, healthy, and flavorful options. I like that they have quinoa pasta as a healthy alternative to regular pasta. The quinoa pasta can be a little clumpy at times, but that is just the nature of the beast, if you've ever cooked it at home you would know. I've also had their fresh juice which is quite good and reasonably priced. Grabba Green had become a part of my lunch rotation due to the convenience, healthy options, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"LOVE juice is amazing.  Refreshing and delicious.  I had an immunity shot as well.   My friend had the Immune Juice and it's great. Clean store friendly sweet staff.  I'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for what you get. The juice was nothing spectacular. I also got a side of salmon which was served as greasy little cube pieces. It tasted and smelled very fishy and I ended up throwing it out.  The tables are right up against the line area with clunky metal chairs that are loud and screechy when you move them."}
{"text":"I stopped by after reading some great reviews. But also because it's one of the few healthy juice and smoothie places in North Scottsdale (which is kind of odd, right?) I spend most of my time on the east coast where juice places are on every corner and 'real' juice (like the green stuff) is sold in stores so it's easy to get. The menu at grabba green is robust, good selection. Maybe a little overwhelming for a first timer, but whatevs-you can def get what you need.
I ordered 3 smoothies, here the thing: they were so ice cold I could hardly taste the actual fruit and veg in them. ICE COLD. So either the ice weighed out the ingredients in the smoothie or the ingredients are very cold (too cold). Either way, not a lot of taste. That's a shame. And at 11:20am they were already out of wheatgrass. It's Monday, people....
I might try it again....but would probably trek over to try the new True Food juice add on instead."}
{"text":"Cococabana not at all what I expected! It tasted like the smoothie was made with rotten bananas and the ice wasn't blended there were still chunks in it."}
{"text":"$18 for a bag of spinach with watered down tofu, carrots, and about 10 edamae and a small 16oz watered down beet juice (lay off the celery, give me more of the hearty juices). 

I was not impressed. I ordered the dish thinking it'd be veggie and re-read it to see that chicken was halfway down the menu. I asked if I could sub out the chicken with tofu. They were super nice and allowed me to do so. 

I'm all for healthy businesses...but I think it was WAY too expensive for the taste value. My tofu tasted like an everything bagel. I liked it at first but the dressing was too runny to give anything else a flavor. Might try again...but the juice is just too expensive when compared with places nearby like Nektar. 

I wish you could return food like you can return clothes. I threw this salad in the trash the moment I got home with it. Sorry."}
{"text":"I got the \"Gulf of Mexico\" and wound up paying $10.80 for a small box of spinach. Also included: cucumbers, bland eggs, and boiled unseasoned shrimp. Apparently \"seasoning\" to Grabbagreen means dumping cayenne pepper over a few flavorless ingredients and overcharging for it. Overall this was a total miss - completely bland and tasteless. Never again."}
{"text":"Perfect in so many ways... Let me count them!

1.  Perfect portion. I am not overly full, and I am not hungry anymore.

2.  Perfect preparation. I asked to create my own bowl, and they definitely created it just for me. For example, they flash steam the broccoli... It's not pre-cooked! And the bowl is a perfect balance of protein, rice, vegetables, and dressing. I could taste the dressing, but it was not drowning out the other ingredients.

3.  Perfect variety.  Where else can you get chicken, brown rice, beans sprouts, avocado, red pepper, broccoli, cucumber and balsamic flax dressing in one dish?!  You get five vegetable choices, and there must've been 20 to choose from!  And everything was super fresh. 

4.  Perfect service.  The guy and the girl working tonight were delightful.  They were able to answer every question of mine without hesitation and were extremely patient as I made my choices.  I also asked to try two dressings, and they had me try a third one based on the two I had chosen! 

5.  Perfect price. All of this for $10!"}
{"text":"I've been to Grabbagreen a few times and I have only ordered their drinks, which I thought were nothing special but were overpriced. Yesterday, I ordered a salad from there togo because I was in the area and I was very disappointed. My salad was bland and just not very tasty. The girl who took my order was nice, but the other employees were not very friendly. I work nearby and I don't think I will ever be going back to Grabbagreen after not having a positive experience here."}
{"text":"Glad to have found a healthy juice/food place I can get lunch at! And yes, I totally \"cheated\" and got the kids Mac 'n cheese... Makes me feel better on days like this."}
{"text":"I Love Grabbagreen and have been eating here since they first opened. The food is fresh, organic and tastes great. Their chimichurri sauce is really good. The owners really care about the quality of the food and their customers."}
{"text":"The products is great! Tried the Acai cups and it was really good. It tasted very fresh and healthy. Also tried their PP&J  protein cookie which tasted very good and filling. 

Good products but customer service is sucks. It felt like the people who worked their hated their jobs. They did not greet me when I walked in or said thank you after I purchased my food. They we so glum ( if that's even a word). So, it's minus one star for the so-so customer service."}
{"text":"I heard so much buzz about this place and wanted something healthy. I got a quinoa box with salmon. However, there was only a few small flakes of salmon in my box. Disappointing. The quinoa with the sauce was a little spicy. I got the sesame. It was a decent lunch size portion. Not anxious to go back."}
{"text":"I really really really want to like Grabbagreen.  I have now been to both locations a total of 3-4 times so I have tried.  I am accustomed to paying a lot for food as I travel and Grabbagreen could fit right into an airport for overpricing.  I also am used to paying more for fresh, organic salads / food.  That said, I have never left that I was not still starving to death. Today  I paid $10 for the make your own salad which contained approximately 1 1/3 cup of kale, 1 T grated carrot, 1/3 cup black beans, 1 T grated beet, 1 T bean sprouts, 1 t mint and about 2 T of dressing (these are generous estimates).  They would have also included probably about 1 T of feta cheese but I am vegan.  I asked to sub in another vegetable or another herb to replace the cheese.  I was told that due to \"policy\" I could not do that but could pay an extra $0.75 for a t of herb or T of vegetable.  Now I am a consultant and engineer so I decided to run a little experiment, knowing full well that the cheese was one of the more expensive items and that they were financially ahead to honor this request especially since they tout vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options.  I went to Whole Paychecks and purchased the exact same ingredients.  Then I calculated how much was in my salad and what the food cost was.  Now this was paying full and marked up retail so a good bit more than they pay.  The food cost I estimated without the cheese was $2.66 which like I said I paid $10 for.  This was a 3.77 X markup which is healthy in the food industry.  The cheese cost was about $0.50 based on my numbers and was easily the most expensive thing except for the greens themselves.  So in other words they could have had both a happy customer and a lower cost salad for themselves if they were not so obtuse with their \"policy.\"  Will I go back - probably but only because one of my buddies loves this place.  If you want  overpriced food and silly policies - go for it.  If not there are lots of other great places in Phoenix that will treat you better and provide better value."}
{"text":"Very addicting! The food is a health nuts dream, but so full of flavor that picky eaters will be happy.

The juices are terrific. They are fresh and flavorful. My 7 year old loves them and the food. She eats her veggies without complaint. She even asks to come here."}
{"text":"Grabbagreen is The only restaurant where I have had the most amazing salad that I actually ended up buying a second one. The manager is awesome! He operates a smooth, clean, friendly and very tasty restaurant. He is five stars all the way!"}
{"text":"The food is extremely bland and overcooked. Healthy can be flavorful, tantalizing, and delicious, but the dishes here lack inspiration. 

The rice and noodles in the dishes are overcooked. The vegetables are edible, but lack seasoning. The dishes feel forced and put together in a rush without any creativity behind their creation.

Yes, Grabbagreen has smoothies too. I tried one, the experience was better, but still far from the best I've had. The berry smoothie tasted oddly like artificial grape flavoring.

The driving feeling I took away from my meal here, is that the dishes were created by someone who has been removed from a real wholesome meal for far too long and believes, wrongly, that these abominations pass as a fulfilling meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Nothing like it around. The food tasted fresh and my smoothie was the perfect consistency."}
{"text":"The worst pile of mush in crappy containers I have ever had. The place was filthy. The food is actually inedible. I wouldn't even feed to my dogs. Then again they eat raw vegan and organic. This place is a hole. An hour of my life I'll never get back and $40 for two bowls and two juices of all which got thrown away. GG is a JOKE on anything healthy or nutritionally orientated. It's really too bad that people are so desperate for \"healthy\" food or no longer have taste buds from eating so unhealthy that they really think these boxes of crap are good. You know, my bad though. After seeing how filthy it was, no greeting upon entering, being handed off to the sweaty guy who couldn't even look us in the eye to take our order, because I think he was too busy worried about the sweat about to roll down his face, GROSS! I should have walked out. The only thing they have going is location, I think. I live in Cenpho and generally can't stand anything in NS, because as I have found out it always like this. Pseudo trendy, subpar food and crap service to wannabe's. Oh, they hit the nail on the head. Here's my suggestion for anyone wanting to try this place, Grab onto your Greens, shove them as far in your wallet or pocket  as possible and save your hard earned money for truly great healthy food. Take a drive to the SE part of the city and see how Pomegranate Café gets it right."}
{"text":"Love the idea! We need more places where we can get some healthy eats and drinks!
Smoothies and Juices ($7) are great and they have tons of options (squash, beats, ginger, avocado, peppers, gogi, peanut butter, almond milk, coconut water, coco, etc.). You can also make your own. They sweeten most of their drinks with organic raw blue agave. 
Eats ($10) were a little disappointing. This is where the three star rating comes in place. My husband got the Indochin which is a more of a noodle bowl. The flavor was very similar to curry, but doesn't say that on the description, so if you don't like curry don't get this. I got the Gulf of Mexico which was a salad. The shrimp is raw not grilled and the avocado cream is more like mashed avocado. Coming in, I expect it to be healthy; however, being healthy doesn't mean lacking in flavor. I wanted to grab some salt and pour it all over my healthy salad! Not good. I love the concept....so I will be giving it another shot.
Customer Service: Employees were quick and helpful!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy there's an awesome smoothie shop so close to home! They have so many good for you smoothies, I haven't tried the food, but they are one of the few places (like whole foods) that uses amazing ingredients. I spent 7 bucks on a smoothie but it was well worth it, and not filled with sugar filled sorbet like jamba."}
{"text":"I have been a repeat customer for many months now and go at least once a week. It is definitely a more expensive place, but so are all healthy and organic options. Their ingredients are fresh and staff is always prompt. Even with a line, you are sure to get in and out within a few minutes! 

I have ordered their smoothies, juices, and food. Hard to narrow down my favorites but I never leave without grabbing their pre-bottled \"Power\" (spinach, kale, apple, lemon) and \"Wellness\" (carrot, strawberry, apple lemon) juice! Those two taste amazing and are the perfect consistency.  The smoothies are more like meal replacements and I haven't tried one that I didn't like yet!

As far as food goes, I have only tried their Tokyo Bay, which was pretty great. The only issue I've heard is the amount of food crammed inside the box, but let's be honest... Who doesn't want more food? They definitely make sure you get your money's worth; although sometimes I wish it was less rice and more protein. 

Their Grabbagreen application has been a great way to order food and have it ready to be picked up when I arrive. It's very easy to use and navigate between the menu options. Only problem I had was there was no place to redeem a gift card at checkout... I have mentioned to the staff, but nothing has changed. Regardless, great idea if you are in a hurry! 

Noticed there has been an improvement in the staff and their customer service lately which I hope doesn't change!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit. I really want this place to do well so I hope they make the necessary adjustments for improvement. It seems obvious to me that mornings would be a busy time. There were 2 employees but only one was making food- the other went to the back when it got busy. I understand juices & smoothies take some time - they need a better system to manage more than one order at a time. I was sad to see that a place so new had FILTHY cabinets (they had been open for less than an hour so I doubt it was from that day). The food is delicious and I really want them to succeed. Please schedule staff appropriately and maintain a level of pride in your appearance. I want to remain a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"Finally, a go to place for healthy choices offering organic and gluten-free choices but a disappointment, over priced and overrated...  Seriously, we are talking veggies here, unless they can truly justify that it is because they offer organic ingredients only?  Staff was very helpful and friendly and accommodating but c'mon, a little price adjustment would be most helpful.  I recently discovered the juice bar at Sprouts for $3.99!"}
{"text":"As much as I like the food, here are some issues I have encountered while visiting.... Music is WAY too loud... You can barely hear the people taking your order over the blaring stereo.... There needs to be a disclaimer noting that the food is NOT safe for celiacs, nor for people with peanut or tree nut allergies. There should be a calorie count on each of their food and drink items they make themselves as well... This should have been done long before the establishment even opened... And someone should have investigated the actual \"gluten free\" menu and stated it was not safe for celiacs to consume.
Again, I do love the food and the acai bowls and a couple of the drinks, but I really think some of the things I stated really do need to be addressed, or, have disclaimers on the menus about allergies.
My purpose of updating my review is to help them, not bash them... Overall the concept is wonderful, and welcome in a little shopping area of fast food garbage.  If this were my company, I would want input from consumers to help me be a better establishment and to listen to consumers wants or suggestions."}
{"text":"Finally a place where I can customize any of the menu items!
I am dairy, egg, gluten, almond and pineapple intolerant so typically it is impossible to eat out unless I want a salad.  
I especially like the cold pressed juices.  They taste so much better than Whole Foods. Plus if you buy 6 you can get a punch on your smoothie card.
Taylor (one of the managers) told me a discount is available for bulk orders for a juicing cleanse or just to have plenty on hand.  
All of the employees have been helpful and patient in the two months that I have been coming here.
Extra shoot outs to Mandi, Taylor and Brian.  :)
Thanks again for helping keep me healthy!!"}
{"text":"If you're accustomed to shoveling massive quantities of food into your pie-hole and want a $5 super-size lunch this probably isn't your kind of place...
If you appreciate quality and also value your health, this place is an excellent choice. The food was really tasty and made from whole organic ingredients (I had the Tokyo Bay).  The menu was a bit confusing at first since they don't describe what type of food you're getting (sandwich, salad, etc) but once you figure that out you're set... The fact that they'll email you the receipt is a nice touch and keeps your wallet from getting too bloated."}
{"text":"This was all around  a great visit.  The young lady was awesome and guided us to a great. Smoothie.  All I had was a smoothie but they have food and they had customers ordering the food and all seem happy.  I got a smoothie that tasted like a carrot cake as our waiter said it would.  All around very strong!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I'm from New York and was visiting family, my cousin took me here for lunch and it was brilliant. The service was great. The food was awesome (healthy and fresh) I had the  Tokyo Bay and my cousin had the Patagonia dish. It was awesome. Really hoping to find something similar in NYC."}
{"text":"I have updated this review multiple times because it's so hit or miss. One day it's a 5, the next visit, barely a 2. 

I've been here twice in the past two weeks which has been the first time in a few months. When it's great it's great, but when it's not, it's the biggest waste of $10. 

Last week I placed my order online and after getting my food back to the office I realized it didn't have ANY sesame sauce like I ordered, I sent a friendly email to let them know and NOTHING. Not an \"I'm sorry\" or \"our apologies\". The only reason I informed them is so they could do a better job training their staff. And, honestly I think if I'm paying this kind of money, I should get what I ordered. 

Yesterday, however, was spot on. Exactly as I ordered it and the staff was super friendly. Why can't you be more consistent? I would eat here more often with my coworkers if I was guaranteed to get what I ordered."}
{"text":"Every time I come here and get a Grab Your Own box, they do it wrong. I ordered brown rice, chicken, broccoli with the sesame flax sauce, and they gave me salmon. So I paid 12 dollars for rice and broccoli."}
{"text":"Still waiting, 10 minutes to make a smoothie and no thank you or sorry for the wait. I was the only one in the store. Completely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for a spinach salad w chicken. They should stick to making cleanses. Ill buy a salad from Safeway for 3.89 and not pay $16!"}
{"text":"Now this places food is great for the most part, this location has always been pretty average for me. I'm more used to the Scottsdale and Shea location which is always a great experience, but after today I will never come to this Hayden location again. The employees don't interact with you at all. I never even was acknowledged walking in, no one said ANYTHING. There was a couple ahead of me ordering and the woman taking their order took about 10 minutes to take it, two other people had walked in by then and were standing next to me. It was very apparent us three were standing their first. Keep in mind this woman is STILL taking their order. Two more people walk in and another employee finally decides to come to the other register AND DECIDES TO HELP THE MAN WHO WALKED IN AFTER THE 3 PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN STANDING THEIR FOR 10 MINUTES! I was in awe. So after he takes the guys order he switches with the girl STILL TAKING THE COUPLES ORDER and she walks away. Leaving all three of us still standing there 15 minutes later. I just walked out. And wasn't surprised when no one acknowledged me leaving either. One of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had. Congrats. One star for existing."}
{"text":"Delicious, great service, and the best part IT'S NUTRITIOUS! Great service too. They offer online ordering which works out great for me because I do not have a lot of time to take for lunch, as I am busy, busy! Thank you for this wonderful place!"}
{"text":"This review is meant to be constructive.  I would generally submit feedback directly to the business site but I couldn't find anything on their site that lead me in that direction.

First time visitor with high expectations.  I understand the concept and what they are trying to do.  I appreciate the claim of quality, clean ingredients, local farms, fresh food on the go and all of that. With my visit and purchase today I don't feel like their quality standards were achieved therefore, there was little value in what I received and experienced.  

Ordered the South Beach.  I enjoyed the taste of everything, the blueberries were fresh and firm, beets were fresh, kale was crisp and firm, dressing tart.  Missed steps:  Soggy, slimy spinach, inedible beet exterior pieces, stems on blue berries, portion of chicken and blue berries was lacking and missing pistachios.  I discarded quarter of my salad that I found to be unappetizing or inedible.  I am happy to pay $13 for a salad that delivers on it's promise, this salad did not, and was definitely not worth the money spent. 

I'll try Grabbagreen again once the sting has worn off.  I'm intrigued by the rest of the menu and concept itself."}
{"text":"Just do it. Great quality food, the bowls are the perfect portion size, always delicious and fast service. The fresh juices are pricey but very good too. Healthy and yummy - one of my go to places when I am grabbing something quick for lunch. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Thank you, I was in today and had a juice, ordered it with no lid or straw and took the cup to my own recycling. Thank you CG for the information about the Polyproplyene (Plastic) utensils, cups, straws, lids, styrofoam cups, bowls etc... Yes, these ARE recyclable. And read up on PLASTIC and ONE USE PLASTIC. There is no onsite recycling at the store, and there are way more sustainable options for utensils, plates, bowls, cups etc. ONE USE plastic is killing the planet and our oceans. All the cups, straws, utensils used at the restaurant go right into the trash and is ever recycled. Excellence is difficult and rare, and five stars is meaningful when it truly is five stars. Why not be excellent and in service of the entire flow of the consumer chain in a way that is sustainable and serves our whole planet? Great juice and lovely options. Can't wait to see the non plastic options. :)"}
{"text":"I finally decided to write a review even though I have been coming to Grabba Green for a while now. The food is decent if you're looking for a healthy alternate from all the fast food places around here. I would love to give them more stars but their service is horrendous and slow. Horrendous because every time I go, I felt unwelcome. I believe in good customer service especially when your client is paying a ridiculous price for stuff they can make at home themselves. A smile would also be nice instead of having a f**k face all the time. Especially the red headed step-child dude. Maybe you should find another job because apparently customer service isn't your forte. Maybe it's just towards me because they seem to smile and seem helpful towards other people. I'd rather make my own salad and juice then ever come back to this establishment. 

Like I said if you like healthy stuff then do try this place out but don't expect a cheery staff to greet you that enjoys their job or act like they actually enjoy their job and don't expect fast service also."}
{"text":"First time Grabbagreen customer... 

My type of food all the way. Delish! Love the juices too. All very healthy AND organic which is important for so many reasons, one being it makes everything taste better =) This also makes things a bit more expensive, so it wont be an everyday trip for me, but definitely going back for more. Next time ordering either a juice OR a bowl, but not both. $19 bucks for my lunch today was shocking and hurt a little. 

Only suggestion... bigger food boxes please!  I opened my \"So Cal\" and I had to dump  everything into a larger container to eat because it was so crammed in there food was spilling out. Yay for portions, but not yay for the mess on my desk =P"}
{"text":"I responded to Grabba Green's reply and emailed them... they never replied with the gesture promised on Yelp.

 Thank you for replying after the above review with a complimentary drink.  I appreciate the gesture."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time. I've been eating ketogenic for several months, so I eat quite a bit of salads, but you have to stay away from ones heavy on fruit. I wanted some variety over where I've been going, so I checked the menu out for this place online to see if there was anything keto friendly.

The Gulf of Mexico salad was 8 net carbs, great! Well, I walked down there, and the woman who took my order was very friendly. That is where you are getting your extra star. The décor was fine in a sheek kinda way, very limited seating. Free cucumber water was a nice touch.

Anyway, it took what seemed like forever to make my salad, there was only one person waiting ahead of me. I get it, maybe the shrimp was cooked to order, but these things were TINY, like popcorn shrimp you buy for a two year old tiny, which is absurd for a $10 salad in and of itself, but especially if that was what made it take so long. Crisp cooks chicken and shrimp to order and it is way faster than this place. They make like 10 salads to every one here. 

The salad was not mixed, no dressing mixed in, just things piled on top, so I mixed it all. I mean, I get some people don't like that, at least ask. 

So I decide to eat this thing. It was flavorless. The only thing that was good was the guacamole, which was probably a literal teaspoon. They used regular spinach instead of baby spinach, which I don't think I've ever had a restaurant do before for a salad. I certainly would never do that myself when making a salad. The red onion was sliced to between a quarter and a half an inch. I'm not sure why you'd do that for a salad, it makes it nearly impossible to eat without impaling each individual piece of onion with the fork. The whole thing was just bad. After a few bites I was really wishing I had gone somewhere else, but I'm not one to waste food, so I finished it. Not really filling, not good, 90% spinach, which was mostly full grown so it was more bitter than baby spinach. No redeeming quality. Kudos to whoever was working the register to get y'all the extra star.

You want a decent salad? Go to crisp? You want quick and good? Go to Panera. There are lots of options in this price range, and you can eat keto friendly without it tasting like cardboard. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"While stealing coworker's leftovers from the company fridge and not getting caught is certainly an art form, it's not without its risks. Stuffing a large styrofoam container into the trash can is way too noisy and can attract co-worker attention, and, it's easy to spot. 
This is why I choose Grabbagreen.

Their leftover containers are the same used to serve their delicious menu items; a small, unobtrusive cardboard box - easy to boost from the fridge and stuff into the trash without attracting attention, and, usually just enough food to get me to the afternoon break.  
One small drawback.

Grabbagreen only sells healthy stuff, like quinoa and kale and such. They're big on smoothies too, although I've never sampled one yet since my co-workers never park them in the fridge. 
I thought about trying 'Ramona's' the other day when she went to the bathroom, but she's been pretty sick lately and I didn't want whatever it is she has. 

Anyway, I had some quinoa mixed with chicken, kalmata olives, red onions and red roasted peppers. Not exactly what I would've ordered but I'm not complaining since it's free. 
Miranda's leftovers, (name on box) were another story. Way too green. It looked like congealed snot with all that avocado. 
Not sure what it was.

So, I'm giving 'Miranda', whoever the fuck Miranda is, zero stars for her obvious lack of ordering prowess.
Ramona also gets zero stars, but mainly for coughing and hacking up shit all day and not covering her mouth. 
I'll be lucky if I don't get some kind of communicable disease. Jesus H. 

Grabbagreen on the other hand gets five stars, but I'm only going off the quinoa chicken thingy I stole from 'Katy'. What little she did leave behind was darned tasty, but then apparently she thought so too.

Anyways, I always overhear the girls talk about how expensive Grabbagreen is, but I don't happen to share their opinion. I think its extremely reasonable when treated as an office misdemeanor.

For now, I'll have to be content with them only going on payday.
I hope Ramona gets better soon. 
I really wanna try one of those smoothies."}
{"text":"This place was great! Love the healthy menu! The Quinoa bowl selections looked awesome so I can't wait to go back and try some more. I got the Santa Fe and it was excellent! The place is a little cramped and this is my only complaint. Would've been 5 stars otherwise."}
{"text":"Rip off. 
They give you a pound of leaves and save on other ingredients. $12 for kale and spinach is not worth it. I ordered steak and could count on one hand -the tiny pieces they put on the salad. 

Photo: trying to get to the ingredients. Took it all out of the box and I have a giant pile of leaves."}
{"text":"It ain't cheap eating healthy but these guys do a decent job of providing something healthy, filling, and at a decent price point.*  A great place to combat my hunger pangs next time that I am heading in the general direction of that New York style pizza place across the parking lot.



*Yes that is a jab at Flower Child"}
{"text":"Smoothies are amazing! I usually get the immunization station and never have any complaints! Everyone seems really nice and always friendly!

Place does smell like doodoo, though!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a healthy lunch on the run. Their smoothies are super filling and good consistency - taste delicious and fresh. Salads are also amazing - overall speedy service, friendly and yummy! I'll definitely return when I'm in N Scottsdale. I had the PB smoothie - no changes and was perfect!"}
{"text":"I book marked this place a few weeks ago and finally stopped in tonight to grab some grub on my way home from work. 

When I arrived, the gal who helped me out was so friendly and explained the entire menu. I decided on the Mediterranean Sea and was super impressed. This coming from someone who lives on chocolate cake, it (almost) pains me to say that I loved it and will definitely go back when I want something healthy for dinner."}
{"text":"When you're in the mood for delightfully healthy, wholesome, simple food, this place is a great choice. 

The Eat section if the menu allows you to combine a healthy grain, protein, veggies, dairy and sauce in an incredibly health combination. They also have a menu full of combinations - I highly recommend the Tokyo. 
 
I haven't tried the juices, but my husband has and he says they're pretty good. 

The portions aren't huge, but they're not bad for $10 and we always leave there feeling full and happy."}
{"text":"Cute new location, same great food!  This is the ultimate build-your-own place - super healthy, delicious, and as hearty or light as you make it, it's a favorite at our house.  They also have great juice!  

It's small, shiny and modern with a cute little table for kids and some nice outdoor seating.  A great place to throw in the mix when Pita Jungle's full.

They have some brilliant bowl combinations (I love the French Quarter, substituting sesame sauce for avocado cream), or you can make your own.  Tons of fresh, delicious ingredients and wonderful sauces:  combine a healthy grain/spinach, protein, veggies, dairy and sauce.  They have interesting choices like quinoa noodles and edamame.  Their salmon and shrimp are both really nice, the avocado is great, and I highly recommend using the edamame."}
{"text":"I got the energy elevator smoothie with cinnamon added in (recommendation of the cashier). Pretty dang good smoothie, but for $9 I think it's a little steep. They obviously use awesome ingredients and that's the only reason I can justify the price point but this definitely won't be my regular place."}
{"text":"I definitely have to say how grateful I am that this place is down the street from where I work. 

The smoothies are tasty and I definitely have enjoyed each one I have tried. 
It gets a little busy at lunch, so I try to swing by early to beat the crowd. 

It would be great to have a count of ingredients/calories that way you know what you are consuming. 

The only downside I will say, is that I understand customer service can be a little stressful, especially in a rush, however, I am paying $7.50 for a smoothie, not the attitude I get because I asked you if I could possibly add more banana into the smoothie. Whoever is at the register is generally hit or miss, some days you are a huge inconvenience and others you are the best thing that ever walked up to them! 

That aside, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I want to love this place, but there is always an issue. Once I ordered a South Beach salad and because they were out of some ingredients they substituted things not normally in the salad without asking. This time I ask them to use raw nuts instead of roasted and now they do not carry raw nuts anymore!!!  Also, the orange cashew dressing (the only dressing without oil) is now made with roasted cashews!  I come here because I can eat completely \"clean\" and raw, now not possible. The other issue it that the place is slightly filthy. The sun is shining in and I see dust everywhere.  Both doors look like they have not been wiped down in a month and the transition plate underneath the door is gross!  Truly, I love the immune juice and as I said before, I REALLY WANT TO LOVE THIS PLACE!  Please, clean it up and keep things raw and healthy! Now they say they have never had raw nuts, always roasted. Strange, that is not what they said two months ago!!! Frustrating!!!!!"}
{"text":"Healthy. Very healthy. It tastes healthy and it is healthy. That's not to say it's bad though! In fact, the flavor was pretty tasty, especially when I added the hot sauce to my salad. When I say healthy, I don't mean healthy tortilla wraps. They don't serve bread here so come in prepared to go bread-free. I ordered one of their salads which was stock full of avocado and other delicious veggies and chicken. It was really good, but I love bread so I would have loved to have the salad as a wrap. But again, this isn't the place to expect bread! I will definitely visit again if I'm in the mood for super healthy and I want to try one of their shakes or bowls as well."}
{"text":"Calling all vegans, pescatarians, protein lovers, and paleo enthusiasts. There is something for everyone here and order whatever delights your fancy without feeling guilty. 
Want breakfast but don't eat bread? Try their breakfast wrap made with a leafy green collards instead of a tortilla.  Even their breakfast sandwich is superb... using quinoa \"cakes\" instead of a biscuit/croissant.  
For lunch and dinner,  you can make your own bowl with choosing a variety of sauces then mix it with brown rice,  quinoa,  white rice, or quinoa noodles... or forgo the grain and make it a salad. Of course they have their designated favorite bowls so you don't have to design your own.  
It's quick and quality food I've been wanting for a long time!"}
{"text":"Very tasty shakes and funny names...I had the la la luscious or something like that"}
{"text":"I'm  visiting Arizona from Chile and my sister introduced me to Grabba Green. The service was excellent and the food is perfect, I get the PB&J smoothie and I have been craving it every day, in fact I think that I will have my sister pick one up for me now......... Yummy."}
{"text":"I had a salad and it was small and so expensive. Smoothies are expensive also. I can get most organic greens at Sprouts or Costco and make my own so much cheaper. I know they have to make money but come on! They should offer a smoothie deal cheaper for a daily special to bring more people in."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a fresh salad, juice or smoothie"}
{"text":"Gluten-free menu, whole foods, all natural sweeteners. It's music to my ears. This place makes it so easy to get something  delicious, quick, and customizable to your nutritional needs. Love it!"}
{"text":"Healthy, fast, delicious options always get a thumbs up in my book. Love the idea for GrabbaGreen. There are some pros and cons to this place, but I'd say it deserves 4 stars because it is so fresh and tasty.

The service is always good here, the people at the register are always informative, let me try dressing samples before I made a decision. One con is it smells kinda gross in there. Guessing from all the green veggies, which I love to taste, but the smell is just so overpowering. Also this place is overpriced.

The food is very good, I always get a build your own bowl. I get a vegan one with quinoa, spinach, black beans, and vegetables. They do give you a pretty big portion which is nice. Everything tastes fresh, and I have never been disappointed with my meals here!"}
{"text":"Love the healthy, quick option for a substantial meal when on the go. Lovely atmosphere for sticking around to eat as well. Super friends staff! Organic, delicious food."}
{"text":"Had a yummy fresh pressed-juice. The menu looked delish. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fresh and Delish! I am so psyched about this place to get quick healthy food- I walked in and was greeted immediately. I asked the gentlemen at the counter what he recommended as I gave him my dietary restrictions- he said the Patagonia was great with a ton of flavor while still meeting my restrictions. I ordered it and it did not disappoint! I love this dish!! So good and full of flavor for being healthy! I love that this dish is warm and has a fresh crunch to it! Perfectly prepared- Yes! 
Very clean and upbeat atmosphere- super friendly service! I'm making GrabbaGreen a frequent stop from now on!"}
{"text":"Last weekend I was extremely tired and in search of green smoothie, this place came up on Yelp search. When I walked in I smelled nice fresh greens, then I realized I haven't eaten anything on that day.

Their menu is extensive, I took time to study each dishes to see what sounds good for my body. I ended up picking Gangnam city, for some reasons, red meat along with all the veggies listed on the menu sounded good.

Salad was very tasty, I thought I wasn't hungry but I ended up eating more than half. Normally portion size would have been perfect but I was suffering from lack of sleep and extreme fatigue. 

Salad and steak (protein) gave me just enough energy to get through my day, my body felt much better after eating something good for my body.

I would love to come back now I recovered from jet lag to enjoy their food and green juice."}
{"text":"This location not as good as some of the other ones. The ingredients were not fresh and did not take as good as the one on Hayden. Don't know if it was the guys working there or exactly what the deal was. Would not go back to that location"}
{"text":"This has become my go to place for lunch and sometimes dinner. I try to eat and live a healthy lifestyle, and if you know anything about me, I succeed at it. If I don't bring my lunch to the office I usually go here as it is convenient, quick, delicious, and healthy. They are the only place I've found that actually serves Quinoa. I highly recommend this over sandwiches or fast food. Give it a try and you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love what Grabbagreen stands for. I just cannot stand the staff that work at this location for the life of me. Very rude and they kept looking at our group like they were talking bad about us. There was at least 6 employees working the day I went and only one person working the register. There was 8 people standing in line and no one decided to jump in to help speed up the process and take orders. One particular black haired male employee was CHEWING GUM while making the food and gossiping with the co-workers instead of making the food faster. I was very grossed out when I saw him chewing away and hovering over my food... My boyfriend got us water and the water tank was filled ONLY WITH LEMONS but when it came out there was black stuff everywhere. We asked the black headed employee what could it be and he just rolled his eyes and said \" I don't know\" then walked away without offering new fresh water. So disappointed. I will be going to the Shea location for Grabba from now on."}
{"text":"Wow I am amazed of the great turn around this place has gotten. The staff is much friendlier and the place is very well kept! I believe my other review helped and now I love going there again! THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"Great place... Truly tasty and healthy food. Great for a quick lunch or dinner!!  I highly recommend the So Cal with chicken... Atmosphere is nice and the owners are very involved and care about their customers."}
{"text":"So, occasionally in North Scottsdale, we get some really snobby South Scottsdalers - the stereotypical ones.  These are the hazards of living here.  I say this because it's really evident by some of the attitudes in some of these reviews, and, quite frankly, as someone who lives and works down the street (both less than 2 blocks) from Grabba Green, it's embarrassing.  If you had a bad experience, fine rate it low, but the whole world is not out to get you - get a grip.

I gave Grabba Green 5 stars, because for what they're doing, they're great at it.  I go here for a juice or smoothie each morning, and 90 percent of the time for lunch 'boxes'.  The staff is really nice, they move quick, and they listen - which is really important.  My juices are always exactly what I expect, as I've juiced a lot at home.  It's nice to not have the mess or constant trips to the grocery store, though!  There is also a wide selection of what you can add to your juice or smoothies, which I love.

The meals are a great value.  10 bucks for organic and whole foods, that give you great nutrition? um, yes.  I've always done a 'create my own' so I cannot personally attest to any of those that are recommended on the menu.  I can say that my own combinations were tasty and well cooked.  I also love that they have many different low fat sauces to pick from that are full of flavor.  It shows that the person who designed the menu put a lot of thought into it.

Grabba Green is a juice bar, with nutritional food.  If you're not someone making an effort to eat better (like whole grains and food rich with nutrients) it may just not be the place for you.  As someone who is actively trying to eat healthier, it's lovely to have it around.  Lastly, as to the cleanliness, it's always been clean when I go in.  

The only improvements I can suggest are that sometimes the morning employees look like they just rolled out of bed, but the blonde woman who usually works mornings, and appears to be the 'lead',  is always pleasant, well put together, and kind.  I'd also like to see them open at 7 AM during the week so I can ensure I get my juice every morning!"}
{"text":"I've been jonzing for a acai bowl so I decided to give this place a whirl.  Very good!  I also got the energizing smoothie which gave me a little morning pick me up.  Those two items came to $16 - yikes...so I will be returning, just maybe not as much as I'd like to."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place - ORGANIC everything. Owner is local. Very friendly staff. Fresh fresh fresh. So good."}
{"text":"First time there! Food was fresh but a bit overpriced. Seems like they're hiding the prices by having the price on the wall menu super tiny. I couldn't find it until after I had already paid bc I was in shock."}
{"text":"My husband, son, daughter and I visited for the first time Grabbagreen on E Shea Blvd in Scottsdale. My daughter has to eat gluten free as she has celiac disease and Grabbagreen is completely gluten free.
My daughter ordered the French Quarter: Avocado, Brown Rice, Cayenne, Parsley, Red Onion, Red Pepper, Shrimp, Spinach, Creamy Avocado Sauce  and she also ordered the Moroccan Mac n' Cheese: 
Chicken, Cheddar Jack, Feta, Quinoa Noodle, Harissa Sauce.
Every dish is made to order with only the freshest ingredients. My daughter gave me a bite of her French Quarter salad with a bite of shrimp--it was like heaven in my mouth.
The two employees were friendly and nice. We were greeted by them immediately upon entering and as we were leaving, they thanked us and told us to have a nice day. 
The restaurant is clean as are the restrooms. We will definitely be back to this location. 
Parking is plentiful and it is in a nice area of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"WOWZA! You know when I have my food contacts on speed dial, the food has gotta be amaze-balls and a top ten-er! When you walk in, the health attacks you and appeals to your senses.  The vibe is alive: the fit customers, the smell of fresh veggies and smoothies being prepared, the sound of the Grabba Greeners making your dish to absolute perfection and when your food is done being prepared ever so quickly, your taste buds will sing! 

The menu is endless. You can get food or drink (smoothies). As far as a bite to eat, I always get the same thing but I know there are at least 10 things I would like. You can pick the pre-made hot or cold items or you can make your own! Just choose your grain, protein, up to 3 super nutrients, low fat sauce, and dairy item. I don't eat a totally gluten-free diet but the stuff I've been reading about gluten says it's bad news. What'll ya know? Grabba Green's menu is gluten-free! I'm addicted to the \"French Quarter\". I don't love Red Pepper so they will substitute it for broccoli or anything I want without the fuss! They did mess up my specialty order once but I am not one to hold a grudge when they are always perfect and consistent in every way. As a side note, the \"French Quarter is loaded with onion so you may want to have your tic tac ready.

I *do* think the price is a little steep for the small portion size but the health benefits and finding good, fresh food is hard to find so it's worth it to do your body good.  

I've seen places come and go in that lil' spot there. It seems to be a buzzin' there every time I go. I really hope that means it is going to stay alive."}
{"text":"This place is great if you don't have taste buds. I have tried so hard to like this place but their food really lacks. The service is always on par but there is no seasoning on ANYTHING. They have sauce but they won't give you enough to have any flavor. It's too expensive to taste as bland as it does. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great place! Love the fact that their menu is Gluten-Free with lots of healthy options :-) Staff was very friendly and place was very clean. Bailey who helped me was super nice! They were very apologetic when one of my orders got messed up and they gave me a card for a free meal the next time I visit without me saying or asking for anything - now that's 5 star customer service!!! Also like that they partner with a charity to help kids! Definitely coming back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Your new \"packaging\" SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Trying to stir a grabbagreen now makes a HUGE mess!  Go back to the box.  It's cute and functional.  IRRITATING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Decent menu if you are in a pinch and want something healthy. Been coming here since it has opened. Always fast...BUT there is a major flaw. I have always loved their smoothies, they are delish. Next time you want one, make sure that you READ the dietary information before you order. The healthy smoothie I love to drink is 450 calories, and has as much sugar as 2 snickers candy bars. As a matter of fact, most of the smoothies are not considered healthy at all..."}
{"text":"The healthy version of Jamba Juice! I always come here for their smoothies, and my absolute favorite is the Feeling Fabulous. Their mac & cheese is awesome as well and is gluten-free!!! I do miss their protein on a stick...they should bring this back!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the Tokyo Grabba and was totally disappointed. It is great that they are making healthy alternatives and it is unique but my meal cost me almost $11 and was completely tasteless and not filling at all. Actually had to go buy food after at the restaurant next door because my stomach was still grumbling. Although the food was totally bland and overpriced, I wouldn't mind giving it another shot for their smoothies and juices."}
{"text":"This disappointed me in so many ways. I have gone to multiple Grabbagreens but this one really dropped the ball. I decided to do a three day juice cleanse, that runs about $180. I was told my order would be done at 10:00am and it was... that was the end of the positive experience. I blame myself for not checking while I was still at the store, but they prepared the wrong program for me, which took some ignoring of the paperwork because we (the Mgr & I) reviewed both options & I was clear why I chose option one. I was told all juice & the \"shots\" were prepared fresh & they are good for five days. I picked my juice up on 6/27/17, with the intention of starting the cleanse on the 28th... unfortunately I wasn't able to start until the 29th... imagine my surprise when I realized my \"fresh\" juice expired on 6/29 & 6/30. By this time I was in the mountains with limited connectivity. On Saturday 7/1, I made my first call to the Mgr and was told he was not available, but would call me back. No call ever came. Once I was home, I tried again... and again the Mgr was not available. It is now 7/12/17 & I've never heard back & I just give up. This was an expensive lesson & a sad one at that... I am a celiac and Grabbagreen is a safe haven for those of us challenged by Gluten. I'll continue to grab my green juice, but unfortunately I can't recommend this particular Grabbagreen to anyone. $180 for juice & shots, set to expire within two days, makes for an unsuccessful experience & a very very very dissatisfied customer."}
{"text":"Ehhhhhhhhhhh I didn't like my Tokyo bay at all. The amount of salmon I got was a joke. The rice was so soggy I didn't eat half of it. Just a mushy box of gross."}
{"text":"Over-rated hipster joint. Hands down.

The staff looked at me like I was their red-headed step child. I AM, after all, over 30. They were friendly enough though, and was served quickly. The juice was quite expensive...$8 for a 12 oz. And it wasn't great. A friend had a meal and spent like $40 for a salad with chicken and two juices. Outrageous.  The pop spewing from the speakers was loud and obnoxious.

I will forgo Grabba Green in the future, searching for \"greener pastures\"! Lol"}
{"text":"Expensive. Smoothies are okay. Salad was dry with very few ingredients. No dressing at all, so I was mostly eating dry leaves. When I asked for dressing they tried to charge me extra. Ridiculous, money-grabbing company."}
{"text":"I really love the concept and will continue to go here since there really is nothing comparable. However, I do think the restaurant could use some constructive feedback. I would not say the staff is outwardly friendly. Asking for recommendations from the intimidating menu don't really occur. The staff doesn't seem to know their product too well. I know that everything is made fresh, but it takes quite a while to get smoothies made. It seems like their productivity could increase if they used their assembly line a bit better. Ordering takeout? Forget about it. My order has yet to be right, dressing on the salads are paltry at best. Asking for custom made orders and usually there is an error. Overall, the food is good. Can't beat the healthy factor. But for a quick and consistent meal, they are going to need to make some changes."}
{"text":"I use to frequent this place all the time but the last visit I got the French quarter to go.  When I got to my destination tge shrimp was raw.  This time my order has way to many red onions that its unbeatable.   Ugh!!!  The who time I was there the employees kept saying there sorry to all the customers who were complaining."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Grabba Green - it's very convenient to pick something healthy up on the way home, and my wife ate there a few times and loved it.  Stopped by last night (Monday) and there were only 2 other people in the store.  I ordered a French Quarter and picked up an Indochin for my wife.  Then staff was rude.  They took forever to get the order out and were bickering with each other - lots of confusion.  I  patiently waited, but wondered how tough this could  be with more staff that customers.  Finally got our food and took it home.  Well, the meals were all messed up.  My French Quarter and some sort of macaroni pasta instead off brown rice.  My wife's Indochin had brown rice instead of  Quinoa noodles.  My wife's spicy almond sauce was on my French Quarter and the veggies were all mixed up.  Very disappointing.  Obviously, no one was paying attention.  We contacted the manager who graciously offered 1/2 off our next two entrees.  So - they messed up two entrees but are only willing to give us 1/2 off?  No thank you.  There are a lot of healthy options these days for dining.  Ii'll hit Flower Child or Kale and Clover.  I want a nice experience and a correct order when I dine out."}
{"text":"I recently started the Paleo Diet and have completely cut out all grains and dairy.  Doing this has felt great but also made it very hard for me to find places to eat for lunch!  After talking with a friend at the office I found GrabbaGreen by Pita Jungle in Scottsdale and have been going back ever since.  They ARE expensive but their shakes and salads are amazing.  At first they gave me a small box for the salad and I felt as if I could have eaten two...then after finishing it I felt so full because of all the organic ingredients that I have continued to go back ever since.  Thanks everyone for making a fresh lunch option possible :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. I am a massage therapist so I am always trying to find foods to eats between clients that wont make me tired after eating and keep me feeling full the rest of my shift. Its embarrassing to have a grumbling tummy while with a client. Gabbagreen has this. 
 
1. The food is healthy, energizing, and keeps me feeling full with out feeling like I over ate.

2. The portions they provide are just right and on some of the reviews I read people complained about the taste, well I got a sample of the dressings before I pick one so that way I pick one I knew I liked. 

3. The price is a little high but if you really think about it Gabbagreen is using fresh greens/fruits and even in the store those are not cheap... If you use cheap materials you will get cheap products... I just hope their fruits and veggies are from farmers markets/local farmers and not from a Walmart produce section.

4. The employees there were very helpful and I had great customer service. All of them had smiles on their faces and they treated the customers with respect. If people complained about this place than they were probably having a bad day before they can in. They should give it a second chance and if not than that just means we won't have to wait in line as long and find a place to sit next time we go in because it is always busy when I go in ;-) 

I just wish there was a Gabbagreen here in Glendale..."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of salads so I was happy to find this place near my new home in Scottsdale. In short, I don't like it and will not be back. Most salad places mix your salad in a big bowl and then put it in a container from which you can eat it. This place crams your salad ingredients into a box without tossing them first and it is too small for the salad so you cannot mix the ingredients yourself. The container is also difficult to eat from with a flap sticking out from all four sides. There are no condiments like salt and pepper. Finally, as I am writing this, the employees are behind the counter arguing about shift assignments which is unpleasant from my perspective as a customer. In short, while I should be a regular customer as a salad addict, too much is wrong with this place and I will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and has helpful and friendly staff. Hunter was especially accommodating and nice!"}
{"text":"Loved the Convenience of being able to get a good and quick lunch that consists of mostly veggies and super foods. My smoothie was Amazing! I got the Spiritulina! I appreciate every chance i can have spirulina! and its not that often unless i make it myself! The  Staff was friendly and my food came very fast! Loved it! im a new grabbagreen addict!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today and it was very tasty! The only complaint I have is that their avocado tasted a little off, but otherwise my salad was fantastic! The customer service was wonderful! And the atmosphere that they project is very energetic! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I Recently had a chance to check this place out, tried the Southwest and it was delicious! It was very well crafted and a well balanced dish. Also The juice is absolutely excellent! I will certainly be back as often as I can to try the different options on the menu. 

I was very happy with the helpful informative staff that were very friendly about answering the many questions I tend to have :). Also I think paying an extra dollar or two for fresh, delicious, healthy food is well worth it.

I would live to see one of these in the Tempe area!"}
{"text":"Not really impressed with this juice/smoothie bar. The price is outrageous for an acai bowl that was small and not even good. I mean I could make my own and for another person for $7. Not only that the staff was very unfriendly and bratty. Definitely sticking to originals like Thrive that actually give you something to enjoy."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat and I'm there at least once or twice a week. Too many favs to list. Staff is friendly and make great recommendations. I've never left disappointed. A+++"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a juice, healthy bowl or smoothie.  Definitely great food, but the high school hangout with some of the night shift employees can be a bit awkward for customers.  Still great food, a bit overpriced, but excellent food with solid overall service."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to say that maybe my tastes are heavy but it was definitely a nifty fast food but more awesome type of dining experience.  They do super healthy shakes and food and have some great and unique selections that has opened my eyes to a different array of tastiness.  I got some quinoa noodles with some other fillings and was really surprised about the healthiness taste.  Perhaps I craze the butter and salt but this was wonderful food for the healthy and fit conscious such as myself.  I know I should eat good and this place could and will inspire someone to take the simplicity home and do it!!!  The price points are a bit steep but a new restaurant/swing in always has some growing pains and with time I think this place will definitely ramp up.  I'll be back fooooooooo sho and try the smoothies next time!!!"}
{"text":"Mac and cheese was not good. I couldn't even fix it with hot sauce. 
Noodles melted onto your teeth and had a nasty after taste."}
{"text":"Giving GG two stars because I like the smoothies, food, and juices, but the prices are high for the amount/quality you receive. I was disappointed. Also, they sometimes have samples out (in this case it was a peanut butter bar), but they don't list the ingredients of said samples. I had a major allergic reaction to the pea protein in the peanut butter bars, which could have been avoided."}
{"text":"Grabba Green is amazing. I have a gluten allergy and am following a clean eating diet. Grabba Green is literally the only fast restaurant I can eat at. My favorite is the SoCal Grabba Grain but I also love the Indochin and Southwest. If you are expecting it to taste like most nasty fast food establishments, you will be disappointed. I think some other reviewers don't have a refined enough palette to appreciate the health benefits and delicious flavors Grabba Green has to offer. I eat here 3-4 times a week. I would eat here every day if they had a location closer to my house! You need to try it."}
{"text":"Very clean eating. So many food combinations that can be created it would take a while to get through all of them. Staff was patient with me since it was my first time. 

Will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Quick. Healthy. Very helpful staff. Love the samples. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Finally, a healthy, wholesome, fast-food alternative! I've only visited once and my family tried the French Quarter, La La Luscious smoothie, Feeling Fabulous smoothie and the Detox juice - all were great! The comments I read about the food being bland is probably because a lot of people are used to so much salt in their food, and here they don't do this. I felt everything tasted fresh and delicious! I could taste all the flavors of each ingredient listed in the menu of the dish we ordered. The kids were really digging the smoothies. Any health eatery is going to be on the pricey side, but if I have to eat out, I rather feel better eating here than saving a few bucks elsewhere. I also enjoy their smoothie and juice menu way better than Whole Foods. There are really great combinations, or you can make a custom drink for the same price...and the serving size is bigger :)

The place is pretty small and can get busy, but when I was there, the crew got everyone through pretty fast. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place, but I can't believe you don't have any plain vinegar.  All dressings have OIL in them.  OIL has saturated fat, yes even olive oil does.  You have such a HEALTHLY vibe going, so please offer us health nuts a healthy no oil alternative for salad dressings!  Just some balsamic vinegar would be grand,
Reference:  Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn's book, How to Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease, the documentary Forks Over Knives featuring Dr. Essestyn, the book How Not to Die by Dr. Michael Gregor, etc, etc.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to juice place in Scottsdale! Everybody who works there is super nice and the juice is very tasty!! I'd highly recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Love!! So I just discovered GrabbaGreen. I work in the area and everyday I sit in my office for about 10 minutes trying to figure out where to eat for lunch, since I eat pretty clean. And I inevitably end up at one of the same two places eating the same thing. Well now I have some options!! GrabbaGreen has a pretty cool selection of healthy food, juices and smoothies. I opted for the SoCal and it was full of flavor. I'm a meat girl by nature and this is a vegetarian dish but it didn't disappoint. I also got to sample one of their smoothies (primi protein i think)...super refreshing.  Planning on trying one of their salads next.  Oh and the customer service was top notch. I was greeted by the owner right away and the entire staff was helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"I was looking for a healthy option and a friend recommended this place. I tried the so cal dish with quinoa noodles. It was extremely fresh, healthy and tasted fantastic. The menu has a ton of different healthy dishes, salads, juices and smoothies. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I loved this place the first few times I went, because I'm all for fresh, healthy food. The Gabba grain bowls are really good if you make them right, and the pressed juices are good too but honestly the place is way to expensive for such small portions (I think they justify the price because it's organic.. But still). The inside sometimes has a very strange smell that makes you a little sick, maybe from cleaning solution or something, but it's enough to make you question the food. BUT, if you decide to go here for the acai bowl, it is a definite waste!! They are really gross and runny and taste nothing like a real acai bowl made with sambazon. They really jip you on the toppings too (which are not very tasty either) and mind you, I love acai bowls, so it was really disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is actually amazing.  I've been to quite a few juice bars, and this is one of my favorites.  Get the leafy!"}
{"text":"People in my office go here all the time and so far I have only had a smoothie and it was really good. Everyone loves it so finally I went to the location. Its a little hole in the wall and VERY busy. It smells great and generally they are pretty quick. I had the indochin with out the cilantro. It was pretty good but lacked a bit of flavor in the noodles. I will probably add the soy sauce alternative they offer next time if I get this again.The chicken was good though. Its nice to get a bowl that tastes good and fills you up. Everything is gluten free so that's a nice healthy alternative to whats out in the world.

I will definitely go back to try more."}
{"text":"The smothie was great not too sweet. Service is great. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is for the Styrofoam cup! Come on you're suppose to be health conscious but put my drink in a toxic cup that will never decompose?"}
{"text":"These people do not know what they are doing and I have to repeat my card number several times before they get it right which makes me mad and them waisting their time. They need to listen because I don't need to repeat my order for 3 times for them to get it. I suggest hiring people who know and understand customer service and how to be properly prepared and staffed well bc if ur always under staffed doesn't that tell u something that u should hire more workers?  Just a suggestion but I hate coming here everything is unorganized and not handled properly"}
{"text":"I had pieces of blue rubber bands in my food. The employee tried to argue this was chopped cilantro. Clearly they blended the cilantro with the rubber band still attached. Wouldn't refund my food. 
Won't be back."}
{"text":"Well thought a different Grabbagreen might taste better. But I was wrong! Even when the food is made correct, without rubber bands in the food, the food is still weird. Not healthy weird, just weird. 

My box of noodles stayed in the shape of a box (in the box) and (out of the box) lol. 

I dumped the food out on a plate, when I got home and the food stayed in a solid box shaped square. When I went to eat the food, the noodles were part hard and part rubber. Not good."}
{"text":"It's Great. I Was confused by the name but was very surprised with the on the border salad I got. Big portion and the flavor surprised me. I always went to Pita Jungle, but a friend told me how good it was and I went. So happy to find a new place with fresh veggies and tasty chicken. I have a new place to eat yay."}
{"text":"This was my second outing to grabba green at Scottsdale Shea.  It's an easy place for lunch with a variety of options and flavors that borrow from Asian, Southwest and Greek cuisine .  I've tried the Southwest Rice Bowl and the Gangnam City salad.  Both are tasty with a multitude of fresh ingredients.  I love that you can have warm dishes as well instead of just salads, it makes it feel heartier.  The next time I'm back I've got my eye on the Moroccan Mac & Cheese.  

All of their food comes packed in a little brown box which is deceiving because there actually is a lot of food jammed inside.  I've tried their Juices (the Gingerly) which was fresh-made and delicious.  

I would say however, that I would never take my husband here because while there was certainly enough protein in both of the dishes that I have tried, I don't see it appealing to people who are very meat-and-potatoes.  We tried having lunch here with a few of our guy friends and they complained the entire time."}
{"text":"What a fresh and refreshing lunch spot. Super healthy. They are satisfying all of the LuLu Lemon lovers. The place has a modern clean feel to it. The green colored walls keep the mood levels up along with the trance and chill music. 

There's an abundant amount of choices to create your own lunch bowl. $10 is a fair price. They also have tons of smoothies or detox/juices. All you hear are smoothie machines grinding away to generate your drink to your pleasure. Steam is rising from the rice cookers for your bowls dishes. 

The staff are friendly and knowledgable. FYI, they will bottle and seal your own juices with a two hour notice 

One down side. Every dish is served in a brown box. I personally prefer a bowl since I chose to eat in the establishment. If half stars could be awarded than 4.5 STARS."}
{"text":"Love this place, had the Gangam City and it was a bento box full of delicious no bs greens!"}
{"text":"The food is not only healthy, but flavorful.  If you want to make healthy choices in your life, start here.  I typically order one of the salads and have them swap out the shrimp for chicken.  The avocado dressing is amazingly flavorful.  I also like their juices and find them unique in that the few I have had are a bit tart.   The prices are fantastic ($10 for a healthy, nicely portioned salad with protein) and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"Large selection of juices, smoothies, and even healthy food.  I had a carrot, orange, cucumber, lemon, kale juice.  It was very good.  For a small it is about $6 but a good amount."}
{"text":"About a month ago, I started the juicing trend.  I wish I had the time to make all of my favorite juices, but I don't.  So when I work in Scottsdale, the go to place for me is grabbagreen.

I find their juices and smoothies to be very tasty....so much so that it is hard for me to have a processed juice from any store.  They are fresh and they don't have preservatives, which I find actually refreshing.  I am so happy that there is a place like this in my vicinity.  I can't even complain about the prices.  A little high?  Maybe, but it is a meal that you are having.  (And they have great rice and quinoa meals as well, btw)

My only complaint is the customer service.  They need to have more knowledgeable employees.  And I have been in there many times in the past and not once was I offered a punch card....I didn't even know that they had one until this past week.  I could have gotten a free smoothies 3 times over if I was told about this before."}
{"text":"You won my heart! OMG! I found my new found love at @grabbagreen. Their Southwest Chicken is to die for...of course, drizzled with Sriracha. Could only finish half of my lunch which was still the perfect leftover for the next day. Looking forward to coming back for more at #grabbagreen #imahappycamper #HealthyAndHappy all the way!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a juice place for a light dinner and found Grabbagreen. I came to find that they also had fresh grain dinners and decided I'd try it out.

I was skeptical at first for the price of $10 for a small Chinese food carton sized meal. But the ingredients sounded good and I liked the available options. The amount of personalization was great. You choose a grain, a protein, 5 add-ins, and a sauce. Their pre-made recipes sounded great too.

Still skeptical off the amount of food for the price I dove into the meal as I was quite hungry. That was the most filling $10 I've ever spent. It was bright, fresh, delicious, and beyond filling. I could eat half of that for a solid lunch and save the rest for dinner. 

The sit down area itself was fine. But I would go back for the food, not the ambiance. I didn't end up trying a juice but I bet it would be great also."}
{"text":"Great concept. Super healthy gluten free food, fresh juice, and smoothies! Would return many times in a heart beat."}
{"text":"I went this past weekend for the first time in a few months. I used to work close by and was excited for them to open as there aren't a ton of healthy options in the area aside from Wildflower (which is always packed during lunch). The first time I went, I tried the Southwest, which is delicious. It came in a container the size of a chinese take-out container. When they first opened, they only had smoothies. I think it confused a lot of people that their tagline was food + juice but they didn't have actual juice. I forgot which smoothie I got but remember it being kind of icey and just OK.

I later went back on a hot summer day and tried their Energy juice which has pineapple, mint, coconut water, and apple. It was so good. I could probably drink that everyday. It's so light and refreshing!

This past time I decided to try their South Beach and got the Energy again. The South Beach's vinaigrette was a bit too much for me. I should have asked for it on the side. My boyfriend got the Boost juice. It was good but not very sweet. If it had apple or some other kind of sugary fruit in it, it would have been better for us. 

Their prices are a little higher than similar places. However, it's because they use organic ingredients. If you're wondering if they're actually a healthy place or a fake healthy place, you can go to their website to view nutrition information. $10 for a salad is pricey for me and not something I would do frequently. If organic is important to you, paying more wouldn't be a big deal. Overall, the food and juices are great, the price tag, not so much."}
{"text":"The food was good and the portions were nice just did not like the price, a bit expensive for a salad without a drink. Great location and dining area was kept nice and clean. I live near by so it's great when I wanna eat something healthy cause there ain't much around this area, just a lot of junk food spots."}
{"text":"This place is literally so gross. They have like no toppings, their menu is so annoying to read, and their dressings are bizarre. They have two choices for greens- kale or spinach, pathetic. And only two choices for cheese, TWO. And so I got \"cheddar-jack\" and this is what they gave me. Literally shredded taco cheese are u kidding. 

I was also the only customer in there and this guy literally took 25 minutes to make my \"salad\" I have a stomach ache even looking at this pic.

It's so bad, just don't."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Its tasty, healthy but its still a bit expensive. Still, the do a great job if you're looking for healthy and fast. I usually create my own bowl, which is nice, because I get what I want, and I love that they give you a good amount of the protein (specifically shrimp, in my case). I also really enjoy the agave bbq yogurt-delicious! And the smoothies are yummy too.My personal favorite is the Oxidation Elimination- lots of fruits-love it! I usually go to lunch here on Fridays, kind of a nice way to end the week and a healthy way to start to weekend."}
{"text":"Just walked in to this place and the cute young guy at the counter was more than helpful(even got a free treat). He recommended the green juice and this stuff was Sooo tastey. I ended up buying 6 juices since he recommended them and I cannot wait. If it's as good as the green juice I will be hooked and back. I love places that are fresh and delicious and this place is 5 stars. Would give more if I could! Enjoy All!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a health food nut... But I love grabba green! The greens are very fresh and crisp and I love the quinoa & quinoa noodles.  The flavors are interesting and make my healthy lunch seem like a treat!  I usually choose chicken as my protein, but today I tried the beef and it was surprisingly tender and flavorful! So often, beef on a salad is tough... This was not!

One reviewer mentioned their greens were dry because of not enough dressing... I actually think they just give you too many greens. If you take the salad out of the little to-go box they stuff it in, it is a huge portion. I asked them to go light on the greens, or do 1/2 greens, 1/2 grain for the base and the proportions were perfect!"}
{"text":"I've been to many places near my house for lunch, but o have to say this one takes the cake (not that they would ever sell that). Although I went there one time before and wasn't too excited about my previous choice, I went in a second time today. I am pleased to say that I have found my go-to spot for healthy eats in my area. Give this place a shot, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick, healthy lunch or dinner! I've ordered meals from their 'Grabba Grain' menu twice, both were great! They pack a lot of food into those little boxes. The ingredients are fresh, organic, low cal, and they have some great combinations. 

So far the Southwest is my favorite. It had a mix of quinoa, chicken, corn, beans, tomatoes, avocado, cheese, cilantro and yogurt. Highly recommend! 

My friend and I ate here last night, I had the So Cal which was really good and my friend had to Tokyo Bay and said she liked it. The only downside - my friend tried the iced tea and said it was really bad (bad enough that she tossed it after one sip). Also, it would be great if they had sriracha to add to your meal! 

As an avocado nut, I'm def a fan of how many combinations come with avocado! Prices are a little high but reasonable considering the quality of the food and the amount you get. I haven't tried the juices or smoothies yet but they look great."}
{"text":"Kaitlyn and Thomas cheerfully made my favorite \"Orange County\" for me the other night, 4 minutes before closing, THANK YOU, it makes a difference."}
{"text":"I frequent Grabbagreen at the Scottsdale/Shea location, and have been a customer since it first opened.  The employees are wonderful.  I have often talked to management for answers to my questions when I am juicing.  I love everyone there -- they make an old lady feel so welcome.  If I ever have something that needs a tweak, they will gladly do it and with a smile.  All you have to do is ask.  When I see reviewers who complain about blandness or ask about a tastebud check, I wonder about your eating habits.  Are you eating clean?  Have you eliminated salt and fake food (processed) & carbs from your meals?  Do you eat animals?  If so, you need to do some research.  If you want to live a long life and become an old lady or man, you need to take the steps to eat healthy.  Your tastebuds will adjust."}
{"text":"I LOVE Grabbagreen! The staff is super friendly and the smoothies are delicious and healthy!"}
{"text":"Love their selection of pressed juices! Plus their smoothies are huge and well worth the price... which is still very affordable for all the healthy ingredients you get packed in there!"}
{"text":"We broke a tradition today and it sure was worth it! Every year since my daughters first year of school it has been a family tradition to go for ice cream on the first and last day of school....when I picked up my sixteen year old today she said she did not ice cream but instead wanted to try a new place she read about. So off to GrabbaGreen we went. In a land of high fat, high sugar, deep fried, frozen, processed crap on every corner, this place was literally like finding an oasis in the desert.  I had the French Quarter which I found delicious. The shrimp were delicious and not overcooked, the veggies were fabulously fresh and the creamy avocado dressing and abundant chunks of fresh avocado were just perfect. My daughter got the SoCal and loved it and her friend got the the Southwest and couldn't wait to come back with her family. 
One sure sign that the place is a hit was the line...the place was swamped. Yes, there was quite a wait for our food....consider the fact that this is a new business and I'm sure it will take some time to hit their stride. They are not throwing a chunk of some frozen nastiness into a boiling vat of oil and waiting for a buzzer to go off...they are making awesome fresh food and you have to think there is a little more prep involved. The manager was awesome and when we pointed out that our order was wrong, she comped the whole thing. That made for a win win situation for the customer and gave the business a chance to see what areas they need to work on as opposed to not saying anything then ripping the business apart on yelp with a nasty review! I always find it interesting when you see rave reviews on a restaurant and then read a random review that is just plain mean....obviously it stands out from all the others and you can't help but question the motive. 
As far as price, I will gladly pay a few extra dollars just for the option of eating fresh real food as opposed to the Frankenfood found on every corner. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Healthy food close by.... I usually get the same smoothie that I create and it's always made on time and the staff is always polite. 
Location is good and easy to get to. 
The peanut butter protein bar is dry but tasty. 
Even tried the kids Mac n cheese (quinoa) and it was good. 

Con: prices are a bit high, but it's good so I can't resist!"}
{"text":"Smoothie was good and affordable and Granola was outstanding. And I had a lot of granola in my life. Wish we had one in Atlanta."}
{"text":"I had the French Quarter.  It was a tasty, well seasoned lunch.  I'm so glad there is a healthy, fast food choice!  I think the price is fair for the quality food you get.  I would rather pay a little more (and have a healthy lunch) then pay a couple dollars less for crap (and feel tired and groggy)!  I wish they offered house made, fresh iced teas and lemonades that were served in a big container (like some other places).  Speaking of containers, have you ever noticed how certain containers change the way things taste?  I don't think the little brown boxes do justice for the high quality ingredients.  I know they are recycled but I will be asking for a plate next time (I learned you could ask for one because the owner/manager replied to another customers complaint about them on Yelp).  Great ingredients, great menu, great seasoning, great lunch."}
{"text":"Finally! A \"healthful\" restaurant that is actually HEaLTHY! Great menu, fresh ingredients, friendly service. Prices on the entrees were fair and filled me up! I'm so happy to have this place in my neighborhood. I have yet to try the juices yet....prices seem a but high but I guess I'll need to go back and try them out."}
{"text":"Love GrabbaGreen! The food is tasty and healthy, it's convenient, and there's such a nice variety of ingredients! Only two complaints:  (1) I wish it weren't so crowded at lunchtime! (2) And this is important: I really wish GrabbaGreen would provide nutritional info, or at least calorie counts. I know the food is healthy, but the portions are large (as they should be, for the price), and as a small-ish woman, I'd like to know how much I should actually be eating. Because let's face it: Even healthy food can make you fat if you eat too much of it! Hope GrabbaGreen will take my suggestion to heart. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The food tasted good,not great, definitely edible...the portions are very small.  Way to expensive for what you get. Also, everything comes in throw away containers and they don't recycle!!!!  I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Inconsistent. This is really important! Especially when aren't paying chump change for meals and juices. Listen, in case you haven't notice with all the pro-vegan places popping up in the city area, people are becoming more aware of juicing and clean eating. Yes, I choose to get a juice out every now and then, but I am fully aware that for the same $8-$10, I can hit a farmers market and get enough greens/frutis to juice for most of the week! I am paying for conveniences, so you guys really need to dot your I's and cross your T's here. 

- Portions are way too small for the amount of money being charged. Quinoa and tofu aren't that expensive people! 
- Inconsistently with freshness, don't ever serve an avocado if it's browning, just NO
- Staff aren't whatever somedays, it's really not a small thing, it makes me feel better about spending money if the staff is more friendly, as stated, I know I'm overpaying, its convenience. 

I'm biased to clean eat spots, but I can't let this place get a free pass. Well, in fact I am, because for what you get, this may be a 2 star. But the amount of shakes and combinations are pretty substantial, but they really need to tighten up here. Will re-visist in a couple months."}
{"text":"This place is so good and healthy!  The French Quarter is my fave--I like to add a bit more spice to mine and they will make it anyway you like. They even have a \"make  your own\" menu, which is a great idea. All fresh ingredients from local farms. The Boost drink is incredible and so flavorful and full of vitamins.

Those whining on here about \"I had to wait 11 minutes...it was bland\"--Suggestion to you--go to McDonald's or buy at Subway. Fresh food takes TIME to prepare and both locations are always packed no matter what time I go. I've started the online ordering and pick-up, as it makes it faster. 

Sure, it's not for everyone because ours is not a healthy culture---but this is a GREAT place. If you do care about fresh made food and helping local farmers try it!"}
{"text":"Healthy, Fresh, Fast! What's not to love!!! Love all the GrabbaGreen locations in the Phoenix area! The indochin is my favorite grain option! The Gangnam city is my favorite salad. Or make your own, you can pick and choose from a huge list of local and fresh foods!"}
{"text":"I've had a few different things and enjoyed them all. The Mac and Cheese, Santa Fe, and tonight I had the Tokyo Bowl. It was great. My only complaint is that the salmon is apparently farm raised."}
{"text":"I loved this place when it first opened, however, they have gotten my order wrong several times since and the portion sizes change all the time. Their inconsistency is a disappointment.. You never know what you're going to get!"}
{"text":"I am NOT a picky eater by any stretch of the imagination. I am down to try anything. My husband sometimes hates it because I drag him along to try different places, where he enjoys consistency in where we go out to eat.

Anways...I was hoping GrabbaGreens would be in similar fashion to the fresh, garden-picked menu items I've tried before at other places (Kale & Clover or Pressed Juicery). Though my Orange County GrabbaGreen selection had all the ingredients I liked, I was suprisingly disappointed in the almost inedible flavor it had. I ended up throwing it away after a few bites (which I NEVER do). AND, on top of that, got sick almost immediately after eating. Not a pleasant experience....

It's unfortunate that I had this happen, considering they have a great, healthy concept going for them.

Maybe if I'm feeling a little compassionate I'll give them another try. For now, I'm sticking to the things I know are good (which my husband appreciates)."}
{"text":"The funny thing about Yelp's rating scale is that I'm never quite sure whether I'm ranking it against my own personal experience, the options in the area, my lofty ideals for restaurants, etc. I know that's what makes reviews fun to read, but I also know that makes them subjective to some degree. Well, all that intro inside, I think that grabbagreen deserves 5 stars for the following (hopefully) persuasive and somewhat objective reasons: 

-There is nothing like it in the vast office park wasteland otherwise known as the Scottsdale Airpark area. Between Pei Wei, Wildflower and tons of other predictable options, there's not much to choose from for something simple, healthy and non-chainy. This is especially the case since the Whole Foods in the area closed. 
-If you live in the Silverlake area of LA or Seattle, places like this are a dime or dozen, but there are very few places in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area where you can get a good juice, smoothie or healthy breakfast/lunch and I think it earns major points for that. 
-The ingredient list for the drink and food options is comprehensive in my opinion. Avocado or squash in your smoothie, pomegranate or hemp in your brown rice bowl? Yes, please!

I know it's expensive and it's also got a douchey factor but then again, doesn't everything before it becomes a mainstay of an area? At that point, I think it just becomes hipster - or at least, run-of-the-mill/expected :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Whenever my wife and I want to eat something on the healthy side we choose grabba green. Their veggies and salads are so fresh you just feel good eating it. It is on the pricier side but I feel like it's definitely worth it. My favorites are the tokyo bay for veggies the gagnam green if I'm in a salad mood or the Moroccan Mac n cheese for a richer dish but still healthy with quinoa noodles and grilled chicken. The Sonoran breakfast sandwich is also a must try. It is on a quinoa cake that is really delightful."}
{"text":"Love the healthful salads here. Great ingredients, yet it didn't seem like my salad had much flavor, even with the dressing tossed in. At home, I often use EVOO as a dressing with a little s&p and a splash of vinegar so I'm ok with simple and healthy. But simple should have flavor. I think sea salt may have helped.

I will be back to try something else and hope to update my review then."}
{"text":"Grabba-green strikes me as Grabba-Greedy (sadly) and now I just can't recommend them anymore.

Let me explain. 

Up until about a month ago, I was massive fan of  Grabbagreen. Nice young (and very hard working) hipster staff. Wide selection of juices that are made fresh along with smoothies and a hot foods menu (never tried the food). 

Honestly I got addicted to the fresh juices and smoothies at Grabba and visited the Hayden/101 store  3-5 times weekly for probably 4 months now. I was probably spending $40-$50 a week here on my daily juice fixes (I ordered the carrot, ginger, kale and apple). 

But now they've lost me. I've found better. 

Here are my gripes now as I feel that Grabbgreen has become a victim of their own success:

1. The nice lady with the Southern accent that owns this place recently decided to stop allowing the hard working staff to make tips. Instead about a month ago she replaced the tip jar with a jar for donations to a charity. I'm sorry but these kids are making close to minimum wages - and dealing with a VERY VERY busy lunch crowd making custom drinks and working their asses off. 

Let me tell you something - this place is HAULING IN THE GREEN MONEY BY THE PRODUCE TRUCKLOAD. Can't you let the teens keep a few extra bucks for tips?

Shame on you.

2. A few months ago that nice Southern lady who owns the place also decided to change their punch card policy. It used to be that after 10 drinks you would earn a free smoothie. But now she changed the policy so  you simply get $5.00 off after buying 10 drinks. Gee - thanks.  

Always love it when the owner moves the goal posts mid game - especially when business is booming. Smart. Punish your best customers for their devotion.

3. The drinks here are are VASTLY OVERPRICED compared with a better option like Nekter in Scottsdale. Nekter's prices look to average $2.00- $3.00 cheaper for similar drinks of equal or better quality - with bigger portions. Yes I know they use organic veggies, but I assume they also buy in BULK and wholesale - not at the local Whole Foods. C'mon guys. Lighten up a little. 

4. Grabbagreen smells when you walk in. Whatever the hot foods are that are being cooked up, there is no getting away from the funky odors that permeate the place.

5. Drink inconsistency. I had many occasions over the past months where my drinks varied wildly in terms of  taste (too much apple at times, not enough ginger, etc)

Honestly, there are better juice options in this town now (as I said, Nektar is my new regular fave). 

And to the owner of Grabbagreen: Business may be sizzling now, but things can change on a dime in this town and the competition is coming on strong with... 

BETTER PRICES, ALLOWING THEIR EMPLOYEES TO KEEP THEIR TIPS, AND REAL PUNCH CARDS THAT STILL EARN A REAL FREE DRINK. 

M'am... Be humble and treat your workers and customers like gold - regardless of your initial success -  and you will have a business that will last a lifetime (rather than a flash in the smoothie cup).

So now I choose Nekter Juice bar. After trying Nekter, I suspect you will too.

UPDATE *** I noticed today the very long and detailed rebuttal from the owner of Grabbagreen to this review. To her credit, the response from the owner was intelligently written,  detailed, and put a 'positive' spin on my comments. Thank you. However the explanation about your removal of the tip jar still rings a bit hollow. If a huge operation like Starbucks with thousands of locations can find a way to help employees make a little extra $ with tips, then why  the issue at your particular operation? I think the issue is based more on your perceptions than anything else. Bring back the tip jar for your hardworking teens.

Yours words: \"Grabbagreen removed the tip jar in part due to employee dissatisfaction regarding allocation of tips from the jar. Grabbagreen believed that all of our hourly employees contributed equally to a positive experience for our customers and that tips should have been distributed equally amongst them.\" 

Good - distribute the tips equally. Your the boss right?  Make an executive decision.  

Customers like me do NOT feel obligated to leave tips - we are accustomed to a tip jar and can handle it. People like me don't mind rewarding hard working young people. Regardless of whether you pay $10 an hour or $8.00... lets be clear. This is NOT a living wage. Could you live on $10 an hour? With health insurance, car and other costs? I think not. 

You are rationalizing your decision to withhold tips. You can do better - your business, employees and customers will thrive when you do the right thing. Thanks for listening."}
{"text":"Definitely my lunch time guilty pleasure....whether grain or green, you will be satisfied. I just tried a smoothie for the first time last week, I will be trying everything on the menu! It's my mission :)"}
{"text":"It's pretty expensive so I don't go here very often, but I do enjoy the Energy Elevator smoothie. Today was the first time that an employee suggest I add almond butter and cinnamon for more texture (since it's blended with ice only) and it was even more delicious! I just didn't know it added another dollar, a smoothie that's practically $10! But I have it as a meal replacement for breakfast so that's ok. I once ordered the hash bowl and it was good BUT they shouldn't even call it a bowl. They serve the smallest portions ever and it's in a little brown box. Seriously, I was still starving after that and wish they had served something a little more like Chop House which is actually worth what you spend there. Anyway, this place is good. It's my place of choice for just one particular item."}
{"text":"I went back today and my experience was much better, I got exactly what I ordered and it was ready really fast! Things have definitely improved!"}
{"text":"Love stopping in for a green smoothie when I'm in a rush and needing some additional fruits/veggies for the day! The service is great and they are always helpful finding the right 'taste' for you. It's always extremely noisy inside so I wouldn't recommend bringing work or meeting a friend, unless it's nice enough to sit outside."}
{"text":"I've been coming to both locations since the beginning.  The food and drinks are amazing.  Harry is one of the most polite, well spoken guys I've ever seen at a restaurant, and always takes the time to say something nice. Matt definitely has the place under control, runs a tight ship, is tuned in to what's going on, always remembers my name, and has the confident presence that you'd expect a manager to have.  Luna is adorable, has a beautiful, infectious smile, that can light up the world, and you can definitely see why they've selected her for the first impression when you walk up to the register!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Mediterranean salad extra dressing on the side salmon on the side i cannot eat salmon my boyfriend does. 12 minutes later we get our food salmon on it no extra dressing. this was my first visit sad to say i have to go back out to grab something for dinner since they messed it up and no why would i wait another 12 minutes for a new one when they couldnt get the first they correct. I was excited to come back to try the mango breakfast bowl... doubt that is going to happen. Too many other choices around."}
{"text":"YUM!!! I absolutely love Geabbagreen and this location is perfect for me! Any restaurant who supports local farms and organic as much as they can, should always have high ratings. AND, any restaurant who supports different dietary needs, vegetarian, vegan, GF, etc, should also have a high rating. This is why I love Grabbagreen. It's so fresh, the local and organic support, the vegan options, and to top it off, it's delicious. I've been here a few times and have had a wonderful experience! My favorite is the Grab Your Own, try it with quinoa, spinach, black beans, avocado, broccoli, kalamata olives, topped w/ Orange cashew. Yummy. It's fresh, fast, and healthy. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Tiny portion of food with no flavor. I was the only person there and they got my order wrong. Just skip it and go to the Whole Foods salad bar, you'll get more and better food for less $"}
{"text":"I am not joking:  STEAMED STEAK. I didn't even know such a thing was legal. For some bizarre reason, I went ahead and ate it. Yes. It is as disgusting as it sounds. I ordered a build your own bowl with rice, steak and veggies. The rice was gloppy. The steak was STEAMED. Sooooo gross. Expensive. The people working there not very friendly. My curiosity has been satisfied. There won't be a repeat visit."}
{"text":"I WANT to love this place.  I work nearby and tried the order online/pickup route.  I'm on an HCG diet ...so it was $14 for a Chinese food rice size box of veggies with an ounce of meat.  You get used to over -paying on HCG.  The HCG diet is full of disappointing lunch take out options - but hey - with this I could go the pick up route and specify no cheese, sauce on the side etc.  The website makes you pay with a credit card but when I showed up for pick up, I was told I had to pay at the store.  The food was ok.  but I noticed 2 days later I was double charged.  I tried to call and complain but while on hold for the manager I was hung up on.  I gave them a 2nd chance today.  I paid $20+ today for a $6 12 oz juice drink (I have a cold..am obviously also in the wrong business) and a $10 lunch entree minus cheese, nuts and olives. I picked up my order but they didn't have my juice..,,when I asked, they quickly found it in the fridge.  I left, confident because my box had the name of my dish written on the side.  Got back to work and it was completely wrong.  It had cheese, it had black beans and essentially made me super sad I gave them a second chance and spent $14 on a box of spinach and shrimp where I picked around half of it off.  Overall I'm just disappointed - wondering where my money went and had that sad, shitty monday where you opened up an entree box and see a bunch of stuff you can't eat.  I have expectations - I waited tables a ton and my parents owned a restaurant.  I just expect $20 food when I buy $20 food."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Mediterranean salad with Tofu.  They do charge extra for protein added and $2 extra for the amount that was added....was too much.  With that said, I'd go back again, order the same salad with no extra protein and dressing on the side.  Prefer to be able to add the dressing to my taste - believe less is more!  Anyways,  on a side note, there was some nice eye candy there that day.  The men that were there having lunch --- WOW!  I'm not a cougar...but if I was one, I'd go there for lunch on a Saturday again.  Teehee!"}
{"text":"I really really really wanted to like this place. I even went out of my meat to pick up lunch here I wanted to try it so bad. Had the Tokyo Bay with chicken. Yes, It's healthy, clean eating, love the concept, but what you get feels like leftover mushy slop, smooshed into a small box all jumbled up together with a weird sauce that just doesn't 'go'. It was one of those mmmmm yummmm....errrr...sad face. Healthy food, bad flavor combinations."}
{"text":"Want to eat and drink healthy?  That is exactly what this place is about.  I've liked every thing I've ordered!  A bit pricey on some items... regardless overall pleased with the place and the staff.  It's clean and bright."}
{"text":"I'm surprised there are such negative reviews for this place. Yes, it is a little overpriced so I probably can't go as often as I want to but it was soooo good! Plus, I spend more at places like paradise bakery or ajs and I'd rather eat here. It's so hard to find really healthy places with these kinds of options.  The portions are good, I wasn't full after and I eat a lot. People  who commented on the smell...I didn't really notice but they steam everything so it's just veggie stank."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. You must eat here if you are in the North Scottsdale area! Came here today around 12:30 for lunch for the first time and I definitely left very happy! I had to wait in line for a few minutes but was glad because I did not know what to order. I got the Southwest which was amazing. Definitely recommend it! I waited for my food for about 5 minutes and came out right away. There is lots of seating inside and a good amount of seating outside too! I decided to sit outside since it was nice out and there is shade from the sun so I was pleased by that. Everyone that works there is super nice, helpful and gets the job done. The menu here is so big I want to eat all of it. They have bowls and have smoothies and acai bowls and everything a health nut can think of. I love how easy it is to find as well and there is a ton of parking right by. I definitely will be coming here a lot more for a quick and easy lunch!"}
{"text":"Still really like GrabbaGreen. I love stopping in for a smoothie or fresh juice. Everyone that works there has always been incredibly friendly and helpful (Shout out to Jeremy). My favorite items are the energy elevator smoothie (add almond butter and cinnamon). So good and big enough to be a meal. A number of their juices a great and you can also design your own combos. Their southwestern style salad (can't remember the name) with steak is excellent. And you have to add their awesome hot sauce! I noticed they added quite a few healthy breakfast items to the menu. I'm excited to try them!"}
{"text":"Healthy and delicious! All of the breakfast items are awesome, which is great considering they serve breakfast all day!"}
{"text":"Bland food and cheap ingredients lead to a disappointing meal and a guarantee not to return

Went with the French Quarter with extra shrimp, and for $13 you would expect at least mid sized shrimp, not the baby shrimp that it comes with, also coming in a to go container that Whole Foods uses.  It was pretty bland, not terrible, however the uncooked red onion was a bit overpowering.  I would certainly never want to eat this again, and could make the same thing with better shrimp for half the price.  Medium sized shrimp on the high side are $8.

The acai bowl we ordered was not really even an acai bowl, i would rate it a 1 

We ordered the cococabana which had banana in it, even though it is not listed as an ingredient on the menu, also it was served in a smoothy cup, (serve it in the right vessel) and was not pleasant tasting

The mixed reviews here should be a warning to you (a warning I ignored) 

If you have taste buds and don't want to be disappointed, you can steer clear of Grabbagreen"}
{"text":"If there was a 3 1/2 that's would I would rate my experience today. First timer. Had the Orange County Salad. The box is awkward to eat from. Trying to hold the flap down is a pain. I had read you can ask for a plate so we got plates. For some reason I thought it would be something more substantial but it was a paper plate. Salad itself  was good. But I am not a fan of hot food on a salad. And the chicken was hot. No mention of it anywhere. Ick. Not sure if I'll go back."}
{"text":"Healthy, nutritious, filling, simple. 

Because there's the option to create your own bowl, the potential for things to go awry is there. If you don't trust yourself, just order one of the set items on the menu. You can always get a little crazy and sub out proteins for one another.

I had quinoa + salmon + kale + pistachios + avocado + and some Asian-y dressing, and it totally hit the spot. Could I have made it myself? Yes, but WOULD I have made it myself is the real question.

Overall? grabbagreen is worth the 10 buckaroos if you order shrimp or salmon in your bowl. Otherwise, I'd call it steep, but it's definitely worth a visit if you're in the area and pressed for time."}
{"text":"Meh. Bland and not much bang for the buck. It's not horrible, but lacking in many ways. Good for those I suppose who aren't used to clean eating but may also deter a lifestyle change as well. I love to cook clean and am known for my amazing salads and bowls so I may be a harsh critic. Steaming is generally not a flavor boost for chicken. Everything needed a little salt and pepper and was missing a flavor palate. Was hoping this might be a good spot for the hubs to grab lunch which is why we checked it out. He called it a 'one and done' experience. Go to Urbane or Sharky's. Or food prep and make your own bowls and salads all week. So easy. Fyi, we had the Tokyo and southwestern."}
{"text":"I always see this place but had never gone. I looked up the menu to see what the food was really made of, and I was very pleasantly surprised. I was the only one in the store at the time, so I got my food really fast, my order was correct, and it was really good. I like how they have nutrition information on their website, so I know how many calories I'm eating. The only thing that could be more user friendly is the boxes for the to go food. I ordered a salad and it was a little challenging to eat because the box was not big enough for the amount of food, but that does not alter my overall experience. I felt full for a while after eating here, which is nice to find in a salad. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Grabbagreen is a small eatery specializing in fresh, natural (no preservatives) foods, and they are 100% gluten free.  They have tons of smoothie and juice options if you want a liquid meal. For others, there are salads (greens) and \"bowls\", which they call \"grains\". I opted for the latter. 

I made my own. For the grain I mixed quinoa and brown rice. My protein choice was black beans. You get to pick 5 nutrients and I got spinach, corn, red onion, edamame, and avocado. I skipped the cheese option (of course). Cilantro was my herb of choice, and I got the Spicy Almond dressing.  My meal was a carry-out order and it came in a little brown box, but the box was heavy; you could tell that they packed it in really good. 

It was very delicious and everything tasted quite fresh.  The Spicy Almond truly had some kick, which was awesome. It has a flavor that is slightly reminiscent of a yellow curry.  I also added some chili mango hot sauce to it after seeing the bottle. Yum yum!  I was very full after eating this, so I felt that it was worth the $10.  I think next time I'll only eat 1/2 and save the rest for another day.  

There are lots of options for vegans here, and many of their dressings for the greens and grains are vegan (look for the \"V\" by the name).  The acai cups looked yummy too. I'll have to stop by and have one for breakfast one day.

The only thing they're missing is vegan dessert. (They had some non-vegan cookies.)

Clean establishment. Friendly workers.  Located in the strip mall on the SE corner of FLW and the 101, before you cross under the hwy for eastbound traffic; after the hwy for wb traffic (in the parking lot with Best Buy). Lots of parking spaces. 
There were 2 designated parking spaces for call ahead, pick-up orders."}

{"text":"Update 5/20: I'd love for everyone to read the below owner comment. Being condescending and passive aggressive is never cute, folks. 

Per the owner: \"Wow J'enay, you are the first person who has not found anything on our menu appealing!  We understand our food is \"healthy\" food so it may not appeal to everyone.\"

So basically I am the only person who didn't care for their menu, thus my opinion must be invalid, and apparently I don't know how to eat healthy. Hmm... Let's call this what it is: I don't like your menu, so I eat like garbage and don't know good food when I see it. Ok folks. FYI, Keely N, we eat extremely healthy in our house. Your menu is simply not appealing. This would be why my friend and I both left without food - but perhaps she doesn't know good food, either. 

On to my original review.......... 


Overpriced and absolutely not worth it. And let's be real here. All the fake five star reviews are pretty obvious... A friend and I stopped in here to grab a quick bite, but after realizing that nothing on their menu sounded appealing to us, I decided to just grab a juice and go. First of all, it took three girls more than ten minutes just to make my juice; note we were the only people being served. For $7, I expect more than a tiny cup of juice. I don't even think I was given a full measuring cup of juice, and what I did finally receive was not what I ordered.

And for GOD'S sake. Please stop having each of your 80 staff members ask your customers over and over and over and over and OVER if they have questions. Trust me; if we have questions, we'll ASK."}
{"text":"Great customer service and amazing healthy food! My gift card wasn't working and the young man immediately fixed the solution and made it a great experience!"}
{"text":"Zero complaints about this place. Uniquely presented, good selection, and prices \"are expected\", nice location and everything is fresh. The staff's service is rather informative, nice, and quick. I'd go back quite a few times during work."}
{"text":"grabbagreen is a little silly. i appreciate the premise and i like to support places that give it their best to serve healthy food, but this is just a little off.

juices are $7+; that's a travesty. there is not 12oz of juice in existence worth $7. \"juice cleanses\" are not a real thing - please google it. do not buy juice here.

the food boxes are pretty decent. they definitely do exactly what they say they will do: toss a bunch of fresh and healthy ingredients together in a bowl. i appreciate that they do brown rice and quinoa and udon noodles, and a nice mix of veggie and protein options. kudos for having those options.

unfortunately almost all of the dishes are super bland. sorry guys!!! i still like you. it's just not a great meal for like $11. 

i will keep trying to see if things gets better. but for now.........skip it

god bless

{"text":"a bit expensive for acai in a cup, not a bowl. but overwell good place to grab lunch or a snack. menu was pretty straightforward and easy to see/read. good place to chill"}
{"text":"Inconsistent menu item preparation and staff that lacks enthusiasm or a willingness to be engaging has sealed the deal for me in this place. I won't be coming back. 

I went in the other night (8:15-ish) after a workout for some protein and ordered the collard wrap with chicken. The first time I'd ordered it (a couple weeks prior), the collard leaves were a bright beautiful green and wrapped snugly around the filling. It was yummy and I was looking forward to capping my evening with a small healthy dinner. 

The two people working were cleaning and took their sweet time acknowledging I was even there as I stood waiting at the register. They went back and forth a couple times and finally the girl walked over. Come on... When a customer walks in, ESPECIALLY if there are zero other people waiting, and you're purposely going to make them wait while you finish up something, then SAY something about that. Completely unprofessional. 

The gal took my order, I got the box, and drove home. Upon opening it I was pretty floored at the difference between what I was given that night and what I'd had the first time. Yellowed collard leaves were *laying* in the bottom of the container with the filling just spooned over the top of them. 

Do you guys have no pride in your work? Do you give two sh*ts at all about what you present to your customers and its quality? I've seen other reviews documenting the same complaint so it appears this is a chronic problem. And I do not accept any argument along the lines of, \"Well, it's a fast food joint after all.\" Please. Let me point you to the enthusiasm of the staff at In-And-Out and their happy, fun-loving attitudes, and the consistency of their food prep. Or maybe the folks over at Five Guys hollering out a greeting to people when they walk in the door. And there are plenty more...

In the other reviews I've also seen responses saying \"We've replaced some staff, please come give us another try.\" I don't accept that either. What's the common denominator here after staff has been replaced? Management. This is squarely on you who run the place and set the example. You are obviously missing something and that is painfully obvious in the consistent poor performance.

Change management, change attitude, get some experience. Your values are in the wrong place and until that's addressed with some vigor you will continue to be just another mediocre joint trying to push healthy alternatives and never quite making it."}
{"text":"This place is great....so many varieties of healthy items. I love the fact that I can double my protein especially on those workout days. I just discovered their Moroccan  Mac & Cheese made with Quinoa mac noodles.  A healthy alternative to Mac & Cheese I added broccoli as recommended. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"First time here - just wanted to pick up some smoothies. 
Awesome selection of combos, clean establishment, super friendly staff, I was served quickly and offered a punch card.
Prices are a bit on the high side ($7 smoothies / $10 boxed meal) I would love to become a regular if it were a bit more affordable. Was hoping for better pricing.
Healthy and tasty, just uber expensive. Parking sort of sucks if you hit the peak hours as it does for everything else in this plaza. Good for a once in a while place for me."}
{"text":"Cool place. Lots of new stuff to try and a variety of healthy options. I got the Indochin and it was delicious. A bit pricey for my liking but all fast food in the area is about $10 a meal, so they are on par with the market. I was even able to get a military discount! Thank you! 

The 4/5 stars comes from the physical location of the restaurant. It is very crowded and awkward to sit in there. Tables are inches from one another and its not very accepting. Also this was the first time I ate at this restaurant so when my food was done the guy just hands me a little box, which was my food. Its similar to a Chinese take out box. This may just be me, but this box was beating me. I had a hard time getting my food out of there, and when I stuck my hand in it usually got covered with the spicy almond sauce from the lid of the box. I really did not like eating out of that box... A plate would be amazing, or even a hinged box on one side that opens."}
{"text":"The drinks were absolutely delicious! I was feeling under the weather and have the \"heel\" juice!! The service could've been better older gentleman who was the cashier was not very friendly and very short with questions, however the juice was so good it over powered his shortcomings - and I'll definitely be back!! With improvements to customer service this place would absolutely be my go to!"}
{"text":"Great food, great smoothies. HUGE list of options for both. Not a lot of places offer maca or hemp in a $7 smoothie. Love it."}
{"text":"It's nice having a somewhat healthy place in the Phoenix metro area. This place is a tad bit overpriced I feel. I went in and basically just wanted a bunch of veggies...like a veggie platter. I was happy that they were able to accommodate my request since there is no such thing on the menu. Lesson learned....ORDER OFF THE MENU. This thing cost me $18! It seriously was broccoli, spinach, corn, green onions, cauliflower, cucumber, edamame, and some olives. Lord! 

Aside from this...definitely try one of their smoothies. During a different visit I tried their oxidation eliminator smoothie and it was the best smoothie I have ever had!"}
{"text":"20 bucks for a salad that I could've done at home . Plus no flavor. I'm deff not going back."}
{"text":"Stood waiting for over 3 minutes. The guy never acknowledged me. Not \"be right with you\". No care. And I was the only customer inside"}
{"text":"This small little green eatery is a great alternative to the many waist-unfriendly choices in the area. With a versatile menu open to customization, pretty much any eater could find something delicious here. It definitely has that \"healthy\" vibe that screams, \"Stop here for a post-gym replenishment! If you weren't at the gym, at least put on some yoga pants!\" which seems to deter some more traditional folks. But I hope it continues to attract a large dining crowd.

The food is simple and delicious. I've enjoyed a few of their salads, and I would definitely recommend requesting dressing on the side. I not only found them to be generously poured when added in advance, but they were a little sweet for my taste. My husband loves the quinoa bowls and finds them sufficient in actually squashing his appetite - a rare feat at most health-centric dining venues. He's also praised their smoothies, a treat I have yet to experience.

My only other concern and hesitation toward coming here more often is the time it takes from ordering to eating. It appears as though everything is mostly cooked in advance and ready for assembly, yet it took almost a half hour the last time we grabbed lunch on a Saturday. The menu may have a variety, but none of it is complicated. If they devise some sort of system to improve the wait time, the whole implication behind grabbing something to go (as the name suggests) will be much more true to form."}
{"text":"Healthy, Tasty & Gluten Free!!!

Having gone gluten free and egg free two weeks ago (yes, I'm counting) I've been on a quest for places to dine that meet my dietary restrictions, and provide tasty nutritious food.  I was delighted to discover Grabba Green.  

Before visiting them, I spent quite a bit of time on their website.  In addition to giving up glutens and eggs due to sensitivities, I have to balance my carbs and proteins so that each meal I consume has at least as many proteins as carbohydrates. Their website identifies the ingredients in each of their menu items.  Access to 
nutritional breakdown information is available as well.  I was able to develop a list of which menu offerings fit my needs whether \"as is\" or with some tweaking of the ingredients.  This may not be important to most people, but it really was helpful to me.  It was also very cool that their online menu has a feature where if you click on the item, it shows you a picture of the menu item, clearly showing all of the ingredients.

I arrived at around noon on a Monday, and it thankfully wasn't too busy.  The restaurant offered only counter service, but was clean and pleasant with a fair amount of table space.  Their menu includes wraps and paninis, and meals (bowls) with either grains or greens as the foundation to which other combinations of ingredients are added.  They also offer breakfast items, a variety of smoothies, healthy snacks, and prepared and made to order juices.  

The young man who waited on me was super friendly, and took time to verify for me that the dressing for the salad I was ordering \"On The Border\" didn't have eggs or egg products in it.  That information was not on their website, although Vegan salad dressings were identified as such.  He was also happy to help me reason through how to boost the protein in smoothies that were generally too carb heavy for me to consider otherwise.

Once I ordered, my \"On the Border\" salad (Spinach, Chicken, Avocado, Black Bean, Red Pepper, Tomato, Cilantro, Cheddar Jack, Yogurt Agave BBQ dressing) didn't take long to prepare.  It came in a brown box with enough weight to feel pretty substantial.  10 minutes later, at home, I was delighted with my salad.  The use of ingredients was generous and well balanced, everything was very fresh, it smelled wonderful, and the flavors were very good.  

It wasn't cheap, but I thought that the prices were reasonable for the quality of the food.  I absolutely plan to be eating at Grabba Green again soon.  I already know what I'll have next time!"}
{"text":"I've gone here a couple times now that I work in Scottsdale and it's only 5 minutes away. I made my own juice when I was convinced I was getting sick and that was tasty. I also made my own smoothie which tastes good for the most part but the espresso left a weird after taste, not super noticeable though. My only issue was with my \"grab your own\" the quinoa noodles were in one block of noodles and my shrimp was left out, but I did get there 10 minutes after they opened so I really don't blame them for forgetting some things since it was so early. It is also a little expensive for the portion (except for the smoothie! That was pretty large!) of the grab your own but again it's Scottsdale AND health food so it could be much much worse. I really enjoy all of their vegan options available and the staff I've interacted with are very nice and engaging! Will definitely be eating there more, maybe just not the quinoa noodles.
Oh! I also absolutely love the app they have so I can place an order to pick up without having to make a phone call!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! I'm from LA and this place would fit in perfectly there! The juices are delicious and so good for you! They have an array of options for healthy foods, it's not that it's just healthy its actually delicious! If I live here I'd come often! The service was beyond friendly!"}
{"text":"Fresh as can be, not like the disappointment of Zoeys, which false advertises their so-called freshness.  GrabbaGreen does it Right!  Fresh, clean and healthy, they completely rock! And the staff kicks ass."}
{"text":"I am addicted to this place.. they offer great selection of healthy and great-flavored breakfasts, lunch, and dinner.. if you only eat in one place, you will never be bored with these varieties."}
{"text":"All I want to GRABBA is the TRASHA!

Are you trying to KILL ME?  This is yet another reason WHY YELP needs a negative star rating.  Are you guys in Phoenix checking your taste buds at the door before entering and eating here?

I have had more acai bowls than I can count.  If you know me you KNOW I HATE NANAS!  Thus this is ALWAYS a hurdle I must jump over  when I want an acai bowl.

That said I will lead you through the DIS-ASTER called an ACAI BOWL!  I saw this place passing by while on a business trip.  I can't remember where I was going but I filed it in my mental roller deck to check out.

So I'm HANGRY and I stop near by to pick up a small salad.  I remember this place so after I GRABBA-SALAD I GRABBAGREEN!  And that is when everything went horribly WRONG!

I park and walk in and the place is empty.  I scan the menu and see acai bowl and ask what size they are.  I was shown a smaller size that cost more than they do back home in SoCal and where they are much bigger.  But ok I will go ahead and try one to go with my salad.

I got the ....  It came with mango, pineapple and coconut on top.  I placed my order paid and watched as the young lady made my bowl.  I was pretty clear to not use nanas and to use a different fruit like strawberries, raspberries instead.  It didn't seem to be a problem when she rang me up.

I watched as she made my acai bowl and they DON'T USE frozen acai.  They use some sort of liquid acai.  She didn't put in much but I figured she knew what she was doing.  She did add what looked like a nana and a half. OMG this is going to be a hot NASTY MESS!  

As she was mixing I mentioned I didn't want nans and she said....oh I didn't add many it part of it.  Ok I feel a smart azz coming on.  Why can I not just get what I ORDERED and WHAT I PAID FOR!  If it is going to be a problem then shouldn't the little BRAT have told me that when I was ordering and let me make the choice to NOT ORDER THAT and get something else?

So ok she proceeds.  When she was finished it was a BROWN UGLY SLOP!  BROWN !  Who ever head of a BROWN acai bowl.  Acai bowls are red-ish or burgundy in color, which is WHY they have the name ACAI!  Also it should be the MAIN INGREDIENT NOT a minor ingredient!  

I took it back to my hotel and tried it. It was HORRID!  It was some sort of NANA smoothie with mango and pineapple!  WRETCHED! INTO THE ROUND FILE AKA TRASH!  What an utter waste of moola!  

Is this what how Phoenix does acai bowls?  If so they should all CLOSE UP SHOP ASAP!    I guess you can tell I WILL NOT BE BACK!  How DREADFUL!"}
{"text":"expensive but good, 10 dollars for my fav grain bars but hey worth it. Its a meal in itself."}
{"text":"I have tried Grabbagreen multiple times. I have tried everything from the bowls to the soups, once I did a smoothie (this was alright) but everything i have tried had absolutely no taste. Last night I ordered the grabba chili--do not let it fool you! This is just hot TAP water with no flavoring, and the small amount of vegetables that were placed in the soup were not even cooked properly (crunchy and hard). I have been extremely disappointed every time I have gone here. I understand its healthy but it doesn't mean it should lack flavor! Please work on your recipes and for the love of god open a cook book and fix the chili! I make tea that tastes better."}
{"text":"I've been three times and ordered the same thing each time - the French Quarter.  It's very tasty, healthy and a great \"fast food\" option.  The prices are a bit high but I will  spend the $10 for something quick, filling and healthy.  This is my new go-to spot on the days that I don't bring my lunch to work."}
{"text":"This place is fast, clean, taste really good. Everyone is cool there and ready to tend to you"}
