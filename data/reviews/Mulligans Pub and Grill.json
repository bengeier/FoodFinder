{"text":"Service aws great and they have an Excellent grilled chicken Caesar salad :-) They put cherry tomatoes in the salad and dressing is very good / not too thick ."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service and good prices. The patio is fantastic and the atmosphere is great indoors as well. Try the wings for sure. Great place to watch a game also!"}
{"text":"Food is your basic bar food, dressed up a little bit but overall good. Giving it a low mark for other reasons. Been here numerous times because the kids liked some of the food. Dives me crazy that every time we come in the greeter is attentive, then when seated it takes forever to get the servers attention and for them to takes our order. We go very early because the kids are on a schedule and it is never busy when we go.  The other thing is they either allow smoking or ignore the fact that people smoke on the open air patio and right in front of the front doors. We should not have to drag the kids through an entrance where smokers loiter and then we sit on the inside of the restaurant and are in a wind tunnel of smoke, which is being pulled from the patio area into the restaurant towards the front door. I get it, that is a bar too but why cut down half your customers to cater to smokers."}
{"text":"Been eating here since they opened up, good service, better food. Just chicken wings and a burger tonight but good stuff."}
{"text":"We had stopped here on our way home from Cleveland, And definitely wish we would have picked somewhere else to eat.  My husband and I both had the double cheeseburgers And they were dry also The buns were stale.  Also after the server took our drink order along with the food order she never returned until it was time to bring the check.  Definitely not worth spending the money."}
{"text":"I stop here for lunch every now and then, nice turkey sandwich and soup! (french onion YUM!)"}
{"text":"One of the few places on the west side that you can get fried clams! Love then and the fresh cuts with a cold draft! Great pizza too!"}
{"text":"I eat here roughly twice a month. The wings are at the top end quality wise, always cooked perfectly as well. Service is ok but what the hell its a bar not Mortons. Best overall bar/ grill place I've ever been to. 10x better than Paninis."}
{"text":"I should have more check-ins here! I've only eaten there once and the chicken sandwich and fries was good. The servers are always friendly, and I like the live music they have, too. There is a back room that looks like a sun room and a bar outside as well that is open in good weather."}
{"text":"I used to go here once a month or so for drinks and a quick dinner.  One day I noticed they had a Lobster Zone \"game\".  I'm not sure who thinks it's OK to have lobsters suffering in filthy water while a bunch of hillbillies try to snag them with a metal claw so they can eat them for dinner.  It's like something you'd see at a carnival.  I get it...this \"game\" totally caters to their clientele.  I personally find it completely unacceptable.  What kind of owner would allow this in their building?  I won't go back."}
{"text":"Here for my first time for a tournament and this was by my hotel. Ordered for pick up. Food was ready fast and tasted great! Ribs were amazing and loved the onion rings. Should have asked for a side of BBQ sauce tho. Either way, i would go here again if in town."}
{"text":"My husband loves the $6.00 mug of Guiness and I love the fish sandwich. Their homemade chips  & dips are wonderful too. Great reubens, the Mulligan's Egg Rolls are a great appetizer too. Lots of \"Irish\" feel to the place. Patio is awesome in the summer/fall with bike nights and parking for the bikes it is a nice night out."}
{"text":"Two stars only because the design is awesome, looks like a nice joint...until...you get onto the patio. Filled with smokers smoking cigarettes. Nasty. Oh well I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Service! Service! Service!  Excellent job on the staffs part... went for lunch on a busy Sunday. The staff rocked it. They all worked together and nothing was overlooked! Food is a great deal. And it was all delicious!  They also have a great patio!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday to watch the Indians game and we had good service and good food. While the food is nothing to write home about it wasn't bad by any means- just average. On Sundays during the Brown's games they have $2.50 25oz domestic beers! What a steal deal! I ordered a grilled cheese with potato chips while my boyfriend ordered the corned beef wrap and fries. The chips and fries are delicious! Make sure you splurge on the $.75 and get the chip dip, it's good!"}
{"text":"It's just o.k.  Summary:  Talky bartenders (they talk more to themselves than attend to anticipating your empty beer glass.  Food got better and now average. This place has never been about great selection of current craft beers.  The usual Guinness, DORMUNDER GOLD, etc.  You know the drill.  Go anywhere else and have more fun.  The patio is real nice if you like nothing but cigarette smoke while you enjoy the fresh outdoors.  A real waste in my opinion because the design was well executed."}
{"text":"A must. A have to. You had better.  Always packed for a reason. Wing nights alone would make me come back. Then the live music. Then the perfectly balanced dining areas. Sports fans and families alike can enjoy a great meal at a great price.   Nobody is doing what they are doing here. Service from start to finish. I will definitely be returning.  Portions are fantastic. Quality is never a question. I excruciatingly tried to find a fault in their armor. And if you have been following my reviews on Google and Facebook, you know how hard it is to get a five-star rating from this reviewer.  I never even had to pause at endorsing this place. The intentional business model gave me no choice. It is a well-executed business that will continue to serve for years to come."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place now. The wait staff has found their groove and are polite and helpful almost to a fault. Their varied menu isn't all hits but you can soon find what you like ND get mostly consistent results. Buffalo chicken dip rocks and is my go to appetizer. Occasionally mix it up with pepperoni & sausage rolls which are very good as well. Great burgers that are highly customizable (no bbq burger on the menu but you can get a side of bbq and make your own!) and I love the Cajun chicken sandwich. Drinks aren't watered down and the atmosphere is fun. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Nice place for lunch or casual dinner. Bar area surrounded by regular seating. Booths, high tables, and regular tables available. Live music during most weekends. Weekly and monthly specials on wings and ribs."}
{"text":"Wonderful place, great and friendly bartenders, very diverse crowd, good food, and wonderful outdoor patio! I've never had a bad night there, good vibes all around! Drink are made very well and not watered down, as well as cheap. Daily specials are always good option!"}
{"text":"First off I want to say I love this bar!  I especially love the outside patio bar.  The bartenders are the best around.  You ask why only 3 stars then? The menu.  It is the same, year after year.  PLEASE update your menu! You have removed a few things but added nothing new, beside raising the prices.  You really need to revamp your whole menu."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times when I'm out in that area traveling for business.  I happened to go when it was their 10 wings for 3.50 so the place was packed last time. I had the french onion soup - don't get that. It was terrible. The onions were still raw and they used regular salad croutons under the melted cheese. Did they think I wasn't going to notice??  Their salad was standard - no weird stuff in it so that was good. I've had their lake perch which was good - not overcooked and not greasy. I think most people go there for their drink specials and their wings though. It's a sports bar but everything is very reasonably priced so it's definitely worth it to try it out. Oh!... and their service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Came in while traveling for business.  The service was outstanding, they checked on us multiple times to make sure our glasses were always full.  The food was amazing (try the wings with spicy asian sauce) and came out extremely fast. The portions were a good size and the prices were not bad at all.    The restaurant itself was very clean and up to date.  They also have quite a few good size TV's around the whole place, so there's really no bad seat in the house."}
{"text":"If you arrive and the sign says \"Seat Yourself\", RUN! We had to move tables to get any service and it was slow at that. Waitress was more interested in chatting with other what appeared to be regulars than waiting on tables. Food was tasty and there was plenty. Would like to try again though."}
{"text":"I love this pub. The drinks are great and afforable. The servers are very nice and the service is exceptional. The menu food is tasty as well. The always have events and specials. Great place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday night.  Lots of folks in for the football games, but cleared out rather quickly.  Was VERY disappointed in several aspects of the food (baked potato was ice cold), the chicken teriyaki was very bland.  Not sure whose teriyaki they use, but it needs to be changed.  As for the staff, once they sat me (stood by the door for almost 5 minutes before I was seated) my server was very nice and came by often."}
{"text":"I visited the Pub at 4PM on a weekday, only 3 other patrons in the bar at that time, was served a drink immediately, but not given a food menu, nor asked if I wanted to see one. Eventually given a menu and ordered the Lake Erie Perch with mixed veggies and a baked potato. The food took about 15 minutes to arrive and was very fresh & tasty indeed. The draft beer selection is limited if you are looking for craft beer. On this day the Great Lakes was sold out and the Sam Adams Seasonal and New Belgium Fat Tire were the only other choices, everything else is Macro Lager brew. The only problem I encountered, was that the bartenders were stocking the bar and seemed to disappear every time I wanted a drink. The problem only worsened as the pub grew busier towards 6 o'clock. To be fair, there are 3 separate bar areas: outside patio, which allows smoking, the back bar and the main bar alongside the dining tables where I was seated. I would recommend one of the other bar areas because they are not as hectic pouring drinks for the bar & the restaurant tables. Overall, it was a good experience and the outdoor patio is a must see during the warm weather...cheers!"}
{"text":"Went in here with a group of about 15 people or so.  They were pretty accommodating.  We were in the side bar, as outside space was at a premium.  Bartender and food were average.  I had many Guinness and a grilled cheese with bacon and homemade chips.  Wish they had a better liquor selection, but the bartender did the best he could with what he had for some night before wedding shots.  Although his choice for Loopy and Rumchada (when I asked for Loopy and cream) was not my favorite at all..."}
{"text":"Today was not a good day for mulligans the wait staff was the worst I've had here. Very slow for happy hour and the service is still quite poor here."}
{"text":"Great food and super affordable drinks. Highly recommend this restaurant if you are on your way to Cleveland. Service was great also. They all work together which you do not see often."}
{"text":"I've been here on a few occasions, and they do have a lot of televisions for the Cleveland teams' games, as well as some of the Crushers and the semi-pro teams as well.  The food is quite delicious, and they always seem to have drink & food specials too.    The biggest complaint that I have I guess, if you're a single guy or a group of guys, sit at the bar, and the young barmaids will flirt to no end (obviously to get a bigger tip), and that's not an issue, I would as well, but they take away from couples and mixed groups that are there as well, and they are neglected as a result."}
{"text":"This is place seems to cater to the regulars....if they dont know you good luck getting good service.. to bad the food  is good.... but I think they'd rather be a bar and not a restaurant."}
{"text":"painfully vacant and unattractive bartender served two people who approached bar long after I had sat down and readied my drink order. we'd even made eye contact as she walked past me several times. totally baffling, offputting, and a horrible start to an experience that only got worse. after rolling my elbows in coagulated shredded cheese on the bar several times, we were finally able to flag down the barmaid to clean away the debris from the nacho orgy that had apparently gone unnoticed. were asked what we wanted to eat at least four times before ever even touching or acknowledging the menus which is annoying. once or twice I get it but four or five times within a half hour?  so saw the perch dinner on the chalkboard under dinner specials and had noticed on menu so asked what made it special. answer? nothing. its really just the \"featured\" dish although they do thaw it overnight when its going to be on special. HA!! caesar salad arrives and is spilling over flat dinner plate so impossible to cut or toss which is desperately needed because the dressing is distributed in clumps. loved alternating b/w patches of bone dry romaine stalks and pieces slathered in dressing. but let me get to the \"special\" perch dinner. four pieces, two the size of steak fries and the other two gnarled little filets about the size of a salt shaker. most of it had the taste and texture of a fin that got lodged in the deep fryer. this place has completely come off the rails. wow."}
{"text":"This place consistently rips off people looking for good food for a fair price.  Don't get me wrong.. food is good, but the portions are way off standards!"}
{"text":"Great environment!  Plenty of space although the place can get packed at times.  There is an outdoor patio with a bar, seating and tables.  The food is fairly priced and the serving sizes are great!  Family friendly inside however, I'm not sure if they have a kids menu."}
{"text":"Casual dining and decent draft beer selections.  The kind of place you go to when you want a solid dinner out."}
{"text":"This place was cool .. The music and atmosphere were really good .. I really enjoyed my chicken tenders and fries .. The wings were okay just a little under seasoned .. We sat at the bar .. Everyone seemed friendly except for our bartender .. She wasn't really pleasant or just seemed as if she was having a bad day .. All of the other waitresses greeted us and kept asking if everything was okay .. I'd come here again ."}
{"text":"It took a while for the bartender to wait on us.  Then the waitress wasn't friendly.  There was one waitress that out worked all the others.  I wanted a pizza since they have a sign that said world famous pizza.  When I ordered it the waitress said it would take 30 minutes unless I ordered thin crust.  So I got a thin crust which tasted like a premade crust.  Pizza was about a 2 out of 5.  My wife got a buffalo chicken sandwich that had good flavor, but the chicken was way smaller than the bun.  Te onion rings were straight from the frozen food section.  The building was beautiful inside and nicely set up.  Prices were good as well."}
{"text":"Great food, very reasonable.  We got a basket of fries, 4 beers, Philly Cheese Steak, a Double Decker BLT, both with chips and French onion dip and it was only $40, that included a 20% tip. The service was great and the wait staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of time before, but not for a couple years.  Not sure why, since it's only 10 minutes or so away from home...........Oh, now I remember why!  It was a Saturday night about 6:00, so we knew we would have a wait.  Not bad only about 15 minutes.  We were seated and after a couple of minutes, waitress #1 showed up and took our drink orders.  A few minutes later waitress #2 showed up to take our order.  We ordered a basket of onion rings for the table and 4 sandwiches.  The sandwiches came with their \"signature\" chips.  She asked if chips were OK.  I asked what the choices were.  She said nothing, but you can order a side (like fries) for an additional $2.29 (I believe).  Now a substitution for $.99, I could see, but $2.00+ was a little much.  The onion rings came.....still no silverware or plates for the rings.  Waitress #3 who we flagged down brought the plates, two of the four were dirty.  The rings were average at best, they were like the kind you get int the frozen food dept at the grocery store.  When the dinners arrived, we were all underwhelmed.  The Buffalo Chicken sandwich was not bad, except the bun was significantly larger than the chicken.  Half of the bites were all bread.  The burgers which were ordered medium, came out medium well at least.  And those \"signature\" chips tasted like they were fried last night.  At the end we waited for 10+ minutes for the check and a box.  Waitress #2 (or Maybe it was #1) finally brought the check, but forgot the box.  We told he to forget it (it really wasn't worth taking home).  Two years from now, I hope I remember why it has been so long between visits before we stop in again."}
{"text":"i lurrrve mulligans. i think everything about it is great in my book. good food, friendly servers, great service, amazing patio. what more do you want out of a local pub and grill? no really? what more could you ask for?  mulligans seems to pack in a crowd on the weekends and always on bike night which i think is thursdays, maybe. (lol. i am not a 'biker' per se, so please dont quote me on that.......) but if you are looking for a fun night out that is local, then bring your booty over to mulligans. they typically have bands on the weekends and yes for  all you crazy dancers, there is a dance floor. not big....but a dance floor.....and they have a super fun halloween party as well as other holiday partays.  give it a try! me likey a lottty."}
{"text":"I go there from time to time. For drinks, not so much the food anymore. Was craving some perch for a month and heard good things about theirs. I might have well have ordered a withered piece of leather. On a whole, the food is just okay."}
{"text":"Christmas Ale or Pumpkin Spice Martini. Great dry rub Cajun wings (0.35 wings Tuesday & Thursday). Nice outdoor patio. Been here 5 times an great food and service every time. Highly recommended for the far west side. Live bands on Friday nights."}
{"text":"Great food!! Cold Beer!! Good prices!! A little off the beaten path but def a goo place to go for happy hour or lunch"}
{"text":"We walked in to many open tables and were still told to wait to be seated. The music. Fail. First nickelback, and now let it go from frozen is playing. Haven't even eaten, this is a fail."}
{"text":"Good enough Pub Style food , not amazing but really good. Very happy with their beer selection and wait for this ...... perhaps the best wait staff I've ever experienced  Not a single wait for the next beer and everyone working at this pub went out of their way to keep this guy happy.  10 beers rating for this place , and for sure I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst food I've ever had since I moved to NEO in 1980 It was wing night and I ordered the garlic buffalo sauce. The wings were small and over cooked. My companion had the fish and chips and made the statement that Arby's fish sandwich was better. I was extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here to watch the CLE Indians game on last Sunday night.  No one to seat you, just seat yourself.   When finally noticed, the waitress took our drink order and did get us the drinks.  Since we don't go here very much, we took our time to look at menu. Waitress came by again and we said we needed a few minutes.  She never came back.  After sitting through one whole inning of the baseball game without seeing any staff.  (And my husband kept getting up to try to locate the waitress) we just got up and walked out.  We left money for the drinks.  BYE - won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful which I always appreciate! I ordered a steak which was so so and the perch which wasn't that great. Sweet potatoes fries, were amazing and so was the spinach and artichoke dip! I would come back but it's not what I expected for some reason! Average Pub but great service."}
{"text":"Poor set up for bands. Not really a stage and difficult sitting in booths with your back to the band"}
{"text":"First time here. Was hesitant based on the ratings. Not sure why they rate this place low. Service was excellent. I had the wings. They were meaty and not breaded and great tasting. My wife had a chicken wrap and chips and she really enjoyed it. We are glad we came and we will definitely be back. Thanks to the staff for great service despite being crazy busy."}
{"text":"A buddy and I went after a round of golf.  Wings were excellent.  You know how most people ask for well done and it's a crapshoot?  where they're Papa Bear wings that are still not cooked enough or Mama bear wings that are dried out?  Well these are Baby bear wings.......just right!  Service was excellent and food was very good."}
{"text":"Food is very unimpressive and warrants a 2 star review. The third star is for the very good draft specials they ran during a Browns preseason game and the bands that they usually have playing on the weekends.  Food: Chicken paprikas was too creamy (think cream of chicken soup). Cajun chicken sandwich (small piece of chicken, no real taste), sweet chili chicken wrap (ehh), and chicken Parmesan sandwich (dry fried chicken pieces) were all barely adequate. Fries seemed frozen, rather than fresh. Chips were pretty good and well seasoned. I have had their pizza before and it isn't bad.  Overall, decent venue but food needs an upgrade (really just some TLC)."}
{"text":"OK place to eat, good place to drink. The service is average at best and there is nothing that really stands out on the menu. Open patio in nice weather is a plus, but not enough to save this place. Luckily there is nothing else around them on 611 so no one steals their business."}
{"text":"Shocked this place has bad reviews. I've always had a great experience. Great staff, very quick, big bar, nice patio and it's clean.   Good selection of beers and always cold.  Prices are great. By far my favorite garlic Parmesan wings!"}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would. Do not waste time or money here. I have given it two chances and both times the food was horrible. I asked waitress most recently if fish tacos (which menu just says mahi mahi...nothing about how it's cooked or tortilla type) were served on corn tortillas. Yes! She declares without hesitation. They arrive to me on flour. Other waitress says to me when I pointed out these are not corn like other waitress said they would be and she says \"oh....well the tortilla chips are.\"  A. Know your menu (and its limitations).  B. The fish was fried and horrible. You should list on your menu that it's breaded. These are not fish tacos but a McDonalds fish filet coated in nasty sauce and passed off as Mexican.   Don't get me started on the fake sangria. It's not even close to Sangria.   Anyhow go for a beer or don't go at all. Yuk!!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out. They have a lobster tank that is only 2 dollars to try to win one, and if you win one, they'll cook it for you right then or give you a touches to use whenever you want!"}
{"text":"Love mulligans! The French onion soup is so good! I usually stop every few weeks with the kids for lunch. They ask for \"the usual\" and the servers know they want two cheeseburgers. The staff is always so sweet and takes good care of us. They made me a titos Moscow mule. (On a no kid day) and it was soooo good! It was nice to have a mule that tastes good! The outdoor patio is wonderful! The fire pit is beautiful! The bathrooms are always clean! It's nice to have such a cute place right down the road."}
{"text":"Avoid. Bartenders and servers were doing shots in the kitchen. Granted is was New Year's Eve but only 3pm. Slow service because of this. Manager was the one carrying trays of shots back to the kitchen and then calling all the bartenders and servers to the kitchen. Food was cold and not as described on the menu."}
{"text":"Used to frequent mulligans on Friday nights for happy hour but a decline in service quality made our trips less often. Stopped by today(3/26/17) for lunch and unfortunately had the worst service yet. Some small details... after sitting at the bar, plenty of room as it was not crowded, we waited too long for acknowledgment for our first drink. The bartender apologized and took our order. Midway through our food, we needed refills however our bartender was at a table behind us socializing. For the next 15 minutes we finished our meal and I then had to interrupt our bartenders socializing to ask for a bill. On a positive note, our food was tasty. I was very disappointed in the service and the tip reflected this. The 2 star rating represents the food and service combo. Food was a 4 but service was terrible."}
{"text":"New owners recently took over and with that comes changes. Food is good but the portions are a bit smaller and a bit more expensive. The service was great."}
{"text":"Went here recently with a group of friends and had hot wings and a salmon salad. Everything was great! The service is the strangest thing though. They announce that they will not be your only server from the get-go, but it's still something to get used to. Even though my wing count was off (hey, I get what I pay for!), they were quick to correct it.   The space is big and good for large groups. The beers are huge! Hubby was happy :)"}
{"text":"Great place.  A group of high school buddies chose this place for a sort-of mini-reunion.  Nice to see a quality, upscale, but casual place in the hometown area.  Food and service are excellent; live entertainment and a patio are nice extras.  I recommend this place highly for drinks, casual dinner or get-togethers!"}
