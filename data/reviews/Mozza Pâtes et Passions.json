{"text":"Service at this BYOB was fantastic! On a summer night with a cool breeze, a server brought green fleece blankets to the young girls dining with their parents at the table next to us. My husband, disappointed to see that most of the menu is pasta (which he doesn't love), ordered the veggie sautée. This turned out to be such an incredible dish- that we have been trying to recreate it at home ever since! This dish was a great surprise that deserves a larger font on the menu! I had pasta with pink vodka sauce, which was amazing! I am very discriminating about my pasta dishes and this is by far the best pink vodka sauce I have ever had. For days I talked about how disappointed I was that I didn't bring the leftovers back to the hotel with us. The chefs special appetizer was also delicious. It was something that we never would have selected off of a menu, but the menu was prix fix, so we gave it a shot."}
{"text":"Envie de pâtes mais vous ne savez pas lesquelles, quelle sauce et avec quels garniture? Au Mozza vous serez servi! Assiettes de pâtes pré-sélectionnées savoureuses, belle formule table d'hôte à prix compétitif, large sélection de pâtes personnalisées. Seul bémol est sur la sélection des entrées en table d'hôte, choix limité."}
{"text":"Très bon rapport qualité/prix.  Surtout pour un resto apportez votre vin.  J'ai pris l'entrée du chef qui était excellente (tartare de saumon aux coeurs de palmiers et artichauts) ainsi que les penne gigi qui étaient bonnes mais sans plus."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Stumbled in here on a gloomy Sunday evening not knowing what to expect. We were told that we had to purchase our wine down the street if we wanted to indulge. Not a problem. We had the 3 course offering. I chose a wonderful Caeser salad with an heirloom tomato antipasto salad for my second course. The main course was a linguini pasta filled with fresh vegetables and a generous slice of goat cheese. The service was fantastic! And wait till you check out the restrooms! What a riot."}
{"text":"People seem to not know what they are talking about when they review this establishment.  Super nice waitress, super awesome spot on the patio, amazing decor inside and disco party bathroom!   BYOBottle of wine!  Yes, the menu is in French but most of it is understandable and there is a little menu dictionary on the back, but we just asked the waitress what her favorites were and she led us in the right direction.  Escargot in a pink sauce and ceasar salad were super yumm! I ordered the cream pasta with jumbo shrimps and bree cheese.  If you like cream and cheese this is a dish for you.  I ate the whole thing but it was very rich.  Maybe ask for less cream next time.  My friend had a pasta dish with cream and chicken that was also super good.    Great experience, great food and definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Pasta is definitely their specialty and really it is great value.   The district is a little different but worth it."}
{"text":"Mozza is one of the best places we visited during our stay in Montreal.  I had asked a local for a good recommendation of an Italian restaurant and with a French accent he told us, \"you MUST go to Mozza, it's bring your own wine but the food is outstanding.\"   Naturally, we ran to a convenient store on St. Catherine and purchased a hefty bottle of wine.   Wine i hand we waltz into Mozza - as each dish kept coming out, my tastebuds began to have a party... a party only matched by the disco-party in the restroom of Mozza.  No, seriously, check out the bathroom at Mozza... it is an incredible experience. Highly recommend and I would plan a trip back to Montreal JUST to go to Mozza."}
{"text":"Mozza is BYOB with a straightforward, well-executed prix fixe dinner menu.  The menu is mostly pizza & pasta, but the veggie saute was excellent. We also enjoyed the desserts, and the service was prompt & professional."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent restaurant for what it is. It's a fairly inexpensive place that serves pasta and pizza. What really helps it is the fact that it's a bring your own wine restaurant.  The location and the decor are quite good. I really have nothing negative to say. I've been a few times, and it's usually very good.  If I have one complaint, the last time I went, my pizza was obviously sitting around for a few minutes before it made it to my table."}
{"text":"I ordered linguine Porto and it was so good!! Delicious!! All plates come with Caesar Salad and one more appetizer (I got minestrone, other options escargots or caprese). The tiramisu was mediocre. BYOB because they are dry but will offer you wine glasses. Cucumber water was clutch. Bathroom is lit. Service was great. Fair prices."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Montrèal so far. To those new in town, know that you can bring your own wine! Very good food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is lovely. A hidden gem in the gay village. Their prix fixe menu is awesome. You get a Caesar salad, an appetizer (escargot or bruschetta) and an entree. My partner got the escargot and I got bruschetta and we shared. She had the seafood pasta in rosée sauce with fettuccine and I got the smoked salmon linguine. Delicious and so simple. This is a BYOW place, so make sure you take advantage of that, too! Si vous ne parlez pas français, les serveurs peuvent vous expliquer le menu en anglais."}
{"text":"For a quiet and nice meal with friends or a romantic dinner, Mozza is perfect! I'm so glad they moved to a new location a few years ago. The resto is bigger and offer more space while keeping his quiet charms.  Everything on the menu comes in table d'hôte form for a great price. What i love about Mozza, it's also a bring your own wine.  The food may seems simple but there's always a twist in it. And I love the salad. Just simple and with an amazing dressing.   Been a few times for many occasions and never was disappointed.  And don't forget to visit  the restroom :)"}
{"text":"First time going there. Food is good. You have to try the disco ball washrooms!"}
{"text":"This is a solid eatery in Montreal's village district. The service starts you off very friendly, prompt and accurate as well. The decor is nice, standard for restaurants in the area, though that means it's a little unsure of its own visual identity, club or restaurant. The food is amazing. Every part from salad and entree to main course is delicious. The minestrone I had was uniquely spicy, a real treat. The chicken alfredo was some of the best I've ever had, uniquely light sauce with really good chicken. Next time I visit Montréal, I have to sample some of the rest of what's on the menu."}
{"text":"This place has decent food and the waiters are friendly...my only pet peeve is that they cater to only the local customers, I guess they do not want foreign tourists who visit Montreal to spend their money at the restaurant, otherwise they would have a bilingual menu, like most of decent restaurants in this city, and a bilingual website, as well. I tried the table d' hôte, including the bruschetta, the Caesar sald and the teriyaki pasta, good food, nothing spectacular but good enough. Eventually I will come back."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice now and it was even better the second time! I love the idea of being able to have a salad and an appetizer with your dish that is included in the price. The Bruschetta was fresh but there was only 3 little pieces of crostini. The restaurant is also BYOB which is awesome!! We also got the creme brûlée for dessert because it was my birthday and they had a sparkler on it! It was a great experience, especially the bathroom that has a disco ball and a television."}
{"text":"I can honestly say my meal on Wednesday 7/8 was the worst food I have ever eaten. Every entree comes prix fixe, so the meal started with Caesar salad. The greens were soggy and wilted by the globs of bland dressing and grated Parmesan that tasted like it came from a shaker. The appetizer was escargot, served in a repulsive style I have never seen before: six limp snails curled up in a vomity blueish cream sauce that had a vague blueberry flavor. I have no idea why a food that can be prepared well was presented in such an appalling and inedible fashion. The entree arrived -- linguini with clam pomodoro -- and I could stand only two bites before giving up. It was a nasty chopped clam bolognese, basically, with so much garlic I had to assume the clams must have turned and this was an effort to mask any other flavor. There must have been six or seven cloves in that one dish. And the linguini was waterlogged and seemed like it was from a box. Truly an awful meal. Service, I should note, was good. Very friendly and attentive."}
