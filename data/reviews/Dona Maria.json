{"text":"Ce sont les meilleurs pupusas que jai goûté à Montreal! Le vieux couple sont toujours présent ce qui rend la place charmante. Resto basique mais ce qui importe est la qualité et le goût de les pupusas ou du Platain fris! Ca vaut le détour!"}
{"text":"BEST PUPUSAS MTL! Made by a real salvadorian family that love what they do! I've been to El Salvador 3 times the only place you can get real food is in antiguo CUSZCATLAN and some in el TUNCO or in los PLANES.  FOR SURE YOU CAN EAT THEM ANYWHERE but to find those hidden gems you have to know the locals and to compare with various of there top choices...
Doña Maria is one of those hidden gems but in the 514- MTL so if you need some PUPUSA POWER ..."}
{"text":"The best pupusas in town!!! Hands down. The owners (family owned) are still the ones behind the kitchen so you know you're getting the real deal. Beware : this is not your typical fast service restaurant. Be patient. The older man may have a rude/grumpy look to him, but he's actually very nice. The food definitely makes up for it though. I would recommend the chicken and cheese pupusas and the appetizer platter with fried yuccas and pork. They are open late and right in front of the metro!"}
{"text":"I just got take out from Dona Maria..and i gotta say that i dont know how i never knew about this place.food was great and prices are fair! Not overpriced like some other places have gotten.had pupusas,tamal,plantain and an order of chicharron y yuca.and everything was great!even the people that worked there were super nice.will definatly be back."}
