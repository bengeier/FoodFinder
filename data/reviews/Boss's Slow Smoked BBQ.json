{"text":"Just tried their pulled pork. It was absolutely delicious! The pork was cooked to perfection and the BBQ sauce was a wonderful compliment to the pork. I will definitely be trying other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"I stopped going south on Greenvalley Parkway because I smelled the smoker I turned in and found bosses barbecue. They are just moving into their building site. I tried the smoked chicken quarters had great smoky and it had a wonderful flavor and didn't really need any sauce it was extremely well prepared I love the smoke of the meats and I'm looking forward to trying the other ones on my next trip to it. They are still getting things set up on the inside of the restaurant very nice and cordial and help me with my selections"}
{"text":"We have been multiple times. Food is so delicious. Have ordered ribs and tri tip. Our whole family has started going! Very nice people. We are looking forward to the opening of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"The BBQ literally falls off the bone, and is cooked to perfection. The owners are so friendly and easy to talk to, I couldn't have expected anything more! I got the half rack of ribs, and a couple hotlinks, I will be coming back here again and again. And I recommend this to all my friends, honestly BEST BBQ!!"}
{"text":"Best Pulled Pork I have EVER had..... Moist and very flavorful...Owners work the store and the food and service is great. Look for the big Smoker outside. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Super good food & sweet staff :) I work next door & enjoy coming back often for their service & meals!"}
{"text":"New BBQ restaurant featuring Georgia style BBQ.  FOOD was GREAT, tender & juicy, just like good BBQ should be. The staff was friendly & helpful: the  chef stopped by to check on us. (it was late so he had time). Said they had only been in business for 3 weeks now.  From what we saw, they'll be around a long time...."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but it only takes one time to lose me as a customer no menu to go went in for a sandwich bread was totally soggy for the 8 bucks was not worth it......it will be closed in next month guaranteed"}
{"text":"Terrible barbeque! The meet was spoiled. I am tempted to notify the health department. My wife picked up this food in good faith on 6/13/2017."}
{"text":"Well the meat fell off the bone it was cooked properly it was very tender but my problem is with the flavor there wasn't too much flavor unless you added BBQ sauce to the ribs other than that I liked it"}
{"text":"Maybe we ordered the wrong items or maybe we just didn't care for this style of BBQ, but we weren't all that pleased with our lunch here.  We had the beef ribs, brisket, hot links & collard greens.  The beef ribs had a strange, vinegar flavor to them...almost similar to beef jerky. It was kind of off-putting. The brisket had good flavor, but is sliced in the wrong direction for brisket. It was stringy and long strands, therefore hard to chew. Like others have said, it reminds you of pot roast. The hot links were tasty and so we're the collards.  A friend of ours got the pulled pork sandwich with coke slaw & he was happy with his choice.  I got a banana pudding to go and was happy with it.  I'm excited to have BBQ in the neighborhood, but wanted it to taste a bit better. Maybe I just need to stay away from the beef offerings..."}
{"text":"The meat was so tender and juicy!! The ribs and pulled pork sandwich are so bomb! Love how he puts the right amount of BBQ sauce but still gives you extra! This meat doesn't need to be drenched in sauces it's that delicious! Can't wait for the store to open"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, service is fast, and extremely friendly! Brisket sandwhich and mac n cheese are wonderf!"}
{"text":"I'm guessing the barbecue is probably not that bad. My experience was everything I got was cold. I ordered quarter slab of ribs and some meat nachos. The ribs were cold as was the cheese sauce on the nachos. pretty hard to judge how everything tasted when it was so cold. No one really asked how are meal was so I didn't bother making a stink but I probably won't be back"}
{"text":"I am constantly scouring Yelp for new places to try! This came up and is not too far from home so I had to try it. The food was incredible! We got the Tuesday only Tri-tip Sandwich special and it was absolutely amazing! I have tried several bbq places here in Vegas and this has to be in the Top 3- possibly #1 at this point. The inside is small with limited seating but the food is SO worth it! Stop in and satisfy those taste buds!"}
{"text":"Wow is this place good. Everything was so delicious the pulled chicken and pulled pork sandwiches were wonderful. Huge amount of meat and the sauce was great. Baked beans and Mac and cheese also great, I really liked the peppers in the Mac and cheese to, very smart idea. I will be back and I will be talking you up for the foreseeable future. Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"The pulled pork was as good as I have ever had and if they can duplicate it the next time it will be my favorite place for BBQ pork.  The pulled chicken was very good but the brisket was a little underwhelming.  Some of the brisket was very fatty and other pieces too dry.  I will definitely be back for pork and to try some new items."}
{"text":"The best BBQ I've had in Vegas! Me and my wife are from Louisiana and this is by far the closest thing to southern BBQ out here. I had the brisket sandwich and Mac n cheese with banana pudding for dessert. Nothing disappointed. If you have not been here you're missing out!! I will be recommending to all my friends. Keep doing what y'all are doing!"}
{"text":"Enter BBQ joint #5!! Can we say that Henderson is BBQ city?   So when I discovered this spot couple months ago, I just happen to be driving by when Boss's Slow Smoked BBQ was smokin and serving up their ribs right in the parking lot in front of their restaurant. Started out just buying a pulled pork sandwich. Brought it to my car and after that first bite I took, woah, tender, nice smoked flavor, I was sold! Came back outta my car and bought a slab of ribs to take home. The meat just slid right off the bone, and delicious.    Fast forward couple weeks later, they moved inside their new spot, modestly decorated, but thankfully just in time before the weather becomes too hot to eat outdoors. This time they offer more options like potato salads and side!  Fast forward another few weeks later, there's a cool new mural, a huge menu board is up, they offer meal combinations and sides!    The owners Bernadette and Derrick are down to earth and welcoming to everyone.  BBQ prices are super reasonable and why I have more return visits to this spot more than the other bbq place that's close by. Just turn into the parking lot with the 24 Hour Fitness marquee.  You can't miss them, their smoker is out in front of the parking lot."}
{"text":"The ribs were terrible. Didn't have much flavor. Hot link was pretty good. This spot is not quite ready for prime time."}
{"text":"Some of the best smoked chicken I have ever had!  Crazy good!!!  Brisket was quite delicious as well.  Sucks they're closed on Sundays, but don't let that stop you from trying them.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Dont understand all the other great reviews. This was the worst brisket we've had. It was tough & full of fat. Sure hope they wash the basket they seved it in cause  trying to cut off all the fat  the paper underneath meat tore & you were eating right in the basket. The cole slaw & beans were nothing special. The service not great either. After she cut off our pound of brisket she let it sit & got cold while she rushed to take 4  new orders. When we kept standing & waiting she looked @ me & said \"what?\" Had to tell her  still waiting on brisket & sides she left just sitting. Mind you when we entered we were the only ones there until the 4 guys came in. I asked for bbq sauce & she said should be on tables. Well sauce was randomly sitting  around but empty along with dirty tables we asked to be wiped. We were visiting & purposely drove to Henerson due to reviews. Won't  be back. Won't  recommend."}
{"text":"Love it. Especially the boss platter. Great prices,great deal,great service. I had a  $30 meal at a competitor's restaurant that was half the size of the boss platter."}
{"text":"I love BBQ!! This however is not a good BBQ place. The menu is not the norm of any other BBQ place out there. I couldn't get a 2 meat combo or even burnt tips. They did take the brisket off the smoker to serve to me. Too bad it's dry and flavorless. A pound of brisket is where I ended up no sides no corn bread no garnish. I got this because you can \"make it a meal\" for $3 1 side and a drink, but they were out of half of the sides and if I wanted fries as my side $1 more.....seriously they're fries. I asked if that was a joke she said no they're hand cut and really big.....is the potato salad not made in house. Why wouldn't that be an upcharge? Theres potatos (I assume the same as the fries) and more ingredients in that. With my brisket I was asked if I wanted BBQ sauce....seems strange but maybe some people don't. Ok...I got 2 half full 2oz ramikins for 1 pound of brisket.  All in all this place is over priced and stingey."}
{"text":"WOW!  this is a sleeper.  I guess they just opened recently with inside dining.  This is the best BBQ in Henderson.  The owners are very nice and do a wonderful job of preparing the food.  I have eaten at Lucille's, however, this is better BBQ.  Certainly not the ambience, but better BBQ.  I had their Brisket Sandwich.  It was juicy, flavorful and about 1/3 pound of meat on a very nice bun.  I consider myself a Brisket aficionado, This made the grade.  Now, Collard Greens, my god, to die for.  I took some home for a snack around the TV.  I missed the Peach Cobbler, but I will be back soon and try that.  Everyone was raving about the Ribs and Catfish.  There is a lot of eating to do here.  The food here is as reasonable in price as anywhere.  Lots of bang for the buck.  I will return soon. Make sure you find the right BBQ place in the shopping center.  This place has their BBQ out near the street on GV Parkway.  Yep, this is the best."}
{"text":"WOW !!! Great BBQ ! We went there for lunch and I was amazed at the GREAT BBQ. All the food is excellent and fresh. I watched them make my fries. He took whole potatoes directly from the sack, into the manual FF slicer, and then into the fryer. You can't get much fresher than that! The pork BBQ was tender and plentiful. This place is such a find. Nice people and good food. Reminds me of being back east. I can't wait to try their chicken, ribs, and cat fish. Also all the sides are generous and home made.  This is a MUST TRY place. We will be back for sure. A+++"}
{"text":"Popped in while on this side of town after hearing positive things from friends. The smoker out front is a great touch but the menu is small and the interior is very plain. I understand they're in the process of transitioning into a full-service restaurant though.  Didn't realize the menu is mostly pork, this Texas gal was hankering for brisket, which sets the barometer for judging whether someone can make great barbecue. Opted for a Flamin' Hot Link (cheese, pulled pork, hot cheetos, bbq sauce, and jalapenos, $9), asked for sauce on side. Didn't receive quite as advertised, just cheese, pork, and link- and frankly I don't understand why they're making Frankenfood concoctions with a bunch of junk food on top of the meat, because the cheese covered up how great the pulled pork really was. Flavorful, juicy, didn't even need the sauce. And that hot link was thick and super spicy. Their quality seems solid enough to not need gimmicky carnival-style dishes.   This place is out of my way, but I'm always willing to put in the drive for great barbecue- I'll pop by again and try the ribs, which seem to be their specialty. As they settle in and find their groove, expand their menu and add decor, this might be a really great spot to grub."}
{"text":"Really good BBQ. Only been opened 4 months but they do it right. 4 of us went. 2 had pulled pork, one brisket and 1 chicken salad. All had good flavor. The chicken was the best smoked chicken I've had anywhere. Found it after golf and will come back. Don't let the exterior fool you. The smell when you get out of the car from the smoker outside is so good. The staff is really friendly and attentive. Will come back next time we are in Vegas.  And try the peach cobbler."}
{"text":"Got a 1/2 rack of ribs and I must say it is fresh and perfect.  Couldn't ask for better ribs, come right off the bone and juicy.  Loved it!!! Pretty bad ass and we will be going back for more.  Only recommendation... try making there own BBQ sauce to stand out."}
{"text":"Excellent Barbecue.  Low key,  friendly and efficient service.  Not expensive. We ordered a full rack for two of us which was way too much.  Luckily our hotel room has a Frige and microwave. We won't need to go out for dinner for a few days. Ha!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I ever had!  Great serving sizes at a great price!  Must try the hot links and the ribs,  they were the best I ever tasted!  Everyone is super nice and attentive!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it a four star only because the place is really clean they had enough seating and I had TVs now forThe food I ordered rib tips platter and I ordered a hot link to be there and I did and it was very very good your barbecue sauce is very good but I get home and opened up my rib tip platter it was barbecue sauce everywhere on the french fries on the paper on me on the box everywhere too much barbecue sauce I couldn't taste the meat for the barbecue sauce but that's not going to do stop me  from going back another time I will asked for them to put the sauce on the side and really give him a second chance I'm dying to have a great barbecue place I can always go to."}
{"text":"Really good and priced right for serving size and for BBQ. Ribs were awesome. Meat fell right off the bone. Very smokey. Rub was pretty mild.   I go into most LV BBQ spot with low expectations. Somehow this city grew to 2 Million people with out providing an above average BBQ place is insane.  This place might be the best bbq spot in LV once they are fully up and running.   Ribs fell right off the bone. I mean right off. If you pick up the bone, meat falls right off. You can taste the smoke & the pork simultaneously. The $8 brisket sandwich was really good too.   Only a few very minor suggestions: steak fries came out unseasoned, which isn't a terrible omission. I'm also partial to ribs being brushed with sauce and re-grilled just enough to bring it all together. Get that caramelization on the meat. The mac-n-cheese was just ok. The fries just ok. Not bad not unforgettable.   Only other comment I'd make is I really liked their food and the one sauce they have. I'd like to see that same creativity put into other sauce options. The ribs were so good and I had to sauce them myself anyway. To have a few sauce options to make the meal more playful would have upped the overall experience.  I'm going to come back again! No doubt. Look forward to seeing this place get fully up and running. Two weeks into a half complete dining room they are doing a great job!"}
{"text":"While this is a new business that is not entirely on their feet yet, the ribs and sides were delicious!!  Fall off the bone good with a variety of BBQ sauces if you desired.   Very friendly staff as well.  Check them out!"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ joint in Henderson. Good people and good food. Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Pulled pork nachos, pulled pork hotlink, pulled pork sandwich all amazing finally a reasonably priced non chain BBQ spot in Henderson my family will be regulars here thank you and welcome to the neighborhood we're so excited"}
{"text":"I have looked for great BBQ in East Vegas for some time and looks like its here now! Great ribs, links and pulled pork! The \"Boss\" will see me all summer! Very glad you are here in the area!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a little strip center is a great BBQ restaurant.  Boss's Slow Smoked BBQ is clean, has more seating than expected inside and some patio seating outside.  Tried the Two for Tuesday special - pulled pork and pulled chicken sandwiches with a side.  The sandwiches are full size, and the serving size of the fries is large, and comes with fry dipping sauce!  Didn't have room for Desert, but they do carry some!  They have 2 kinds of sauce (regular and spicy), plus mustard on the table.  Definitely a place I will need to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"We were looking for bbq that was kinda close to home! Did a yelp search and found Boss's BBQ! When we pulled up it looked like they were closing! But we decided to try our luck and I am so glad we did! My husband and I decided to try the Boss Platter! We got it to go! We arrived home with two bags of absolutely incredible BBQ!  Lets start with the pulled pork sandwich - melt in your mouth smoked goodness! Hot link was delicious! Chicken was probably the best smoked BBQ chicken I have had! They were out of ribs - which is understandable at 7pm on a Saturday night! Rib tips were wonderful and omg so much food!  Mac and cheese - on point! Fries were perfect! Just how I like them! Skin still on and thick and plentiful!  Fry sauce delicious! So much food - we will have plenty for lunch tomorrow!  Well worth the money and we will definitely return again to try some of the menu items! I look forward to trying the peach cobbler!!  Overall 5! Staff super friendly and we look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"\"WOW\" doesn't even begin to describe this food!  I had brisket and loved every bite.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I've eaten their ribs twice. The meat is cooked well, however, the quality of the meat could be better,  It was too fatty in some parts and dry in other parts, both times."}
{"text":"I wasn't eating meat before I walked in here and I told the cashier that I was craving one rib so she recommended the rib sandwich and I've never had any BBQ sandwich so good. I have been eating there every day since. I think I'm addicted lol seriously so good! The banana pudding is amazing too. Haven't tried anything I don't like yet!"}
{"text":"The food was very good but they were out of brisket.  How does a BBQ joint run out of brisket?  The downside was the atmosphere.  Some of the help had their children there so they had two TVs tuned to cartoons, one tuned to sports and music playing in the kitchen. This was all turned up very loud.  There were three of us eating and we couldn't even talk across a table."}
{"text":"Meh! I have been here a few times and each time I regret going. The Meat is too smokey for my taste. The chicken was super dry last time I went. They also never have anything that they offer on the menu. You will order something and they are out... Walk another 100' to Sin city smokers and you will be much happier."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the area, hands down. Friendly staff, incredible food at an affordable price. The pulled pro nachos are phenomenal, and enough to keep me coming back again and again. This place has become a staple."}
{"text":"So.... We ordered food for delivery... was simple enough... We placed a big order over 100$ so I expected the food to be worth the 4stars the reviews gave... the ribs were falling off the bone but not seasoned as I would have liked.. the pulled pork sandwich was okay the bun was super soft and good...the sides ? the mac n cheese UGH not flavorful AT ALL and very bland, taste like melted cheese and boiled noodles and I think I seen some tomatoes in it  Why would u do that to mac n cheese anyway... So it wasn't \"your moms mac n cheese\" the beans were okay and the greens ?  I think they got them out of a can   the hot link was VERY VERY VERY dry tasted like it was a day old..  we kept saying the sauce was really really good, until we realized it was sweet baby rays  lol so the 3 stars is more deserving than I should give..."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best ribs we have ever had! My husband traveled across the country and around the world and is blown away! We came from LA, CA and were serious \"foodies\". Never had ribs like this! Fantastic! My 81 year old husband who has eaten ribs all his life said that these ribs don't even need sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent smoked bbq and I highly recommend this place.  Tried the pulled pork, the brisket and the try-tip and they were all very tasty."}
{"text":"Delicious smoked meats and collard greens, yum!  The pork melts in your mouth!  For healthy option the chicken breast has an amazing smoked flavor.  Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  At first I was worried because it looked small and not busy, but then I learned they have only been at this location 2 weeks!  The staff is super friendly, the prices are reasonable, and everything I ate was delicious.  The ribs were tender and fell right off the bone. The macaroni and cheese is amazing! The brisket was tender and juicy. The fries and sauce were so fresh and yummy!  Give it a try. Best BBQ in Las Vegas/Henderson that I have found so far."}
{"text":"Pretty good bbq close to where I reside....tried the mac and cheese and potato salad for the first time and I was not a fan. The meat however, is on point!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Pulled Pork Sandwich, Mac N Cheese and Cat Fish were off the chain, rediculiously good. I can't speak for the rest of the menu, what we had was very good.  Nice little family runned business."}
{"text":"What a delicious sandwich it was tender, tasty, juicy and scrumptious!! The customer service was excellent the place is clean.  The customer service was outstanding; thank you for a great barbecue place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Their food is absolutely delicious! I have tried just about everything on the menu and it just brings back memories of family gatherings when I was a child. Ribs, chicken, greens, hot links (with mustard please and thank you) and peach cobbler are the best! Best part is the price is perfectly affordable."}
{"text":"Soooo amazing! I love family owned businesses and this is my absolute favorite barbecue place! The pulled pork nachos are the best!! Super nice staff as well. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We have a picky kid who actually loves their ribs! My hubby and I are hooked too! A must try for rib lovers. The racks are enormous and you definitely get your money's worth. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Who else in this city has TriTip?? That's a 5 star automatically. Great service and food. Sides are good. Great atmosphere. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork. Food was good, establishment was clean and owner/cashier (the wife) was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great wonderful food! Meat is not dry like how most likely places are. You can taste a true smoke flavor as well. Great service all the time"}
{"text":"Very delicious barbecue !!! And authentic  Me and my boyfriend are from down south and we had yet to find the authentic taste we get back home until we came here."}
{"text":"Came here a few month back and I'm just getting around to reviewing this place. The place was  pretty new still when we ate here. The in side  is clean and the Service was great, the lady that took our order was nice friendly and helpful Nehemiah we asked her around items on the menu. We ordered the Brisket sandwich which was $8.00 And it was pack with brisket coming out of the sides.       I will be back here the next time I'm in town to try some more items on their menu."}
{"text":"Good fresh food, try th ear pulled pork bbq nachos and catfish nuggets, yum!  Super courteous, positive attitudes, clean and well kept"}
{"text":"I don't know their recipe but keep on doing what you know. The ribs I ordered were perfect. The pull pork sandwich is one of the 3 best that I've tried in Vegas. The ultimate test was their peach cobbler. (I have tried 3 places that sell it in Las Vegas). This peach cobbler was 5/5. I hate how much I love it. I will definitely will be going back for more. Good thing I ordered two last time I got food from here!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The ironic thing is we found this place by chance. We were heading to a place that ended up being closed and we decided to try it here. The food is amazing. They are serious about BBQ and know what they are doing. We got the meal for 2, which is more like for 3. The ribs were beyond fall off the bone. The chicken was so tender and juicy. The pulled pork was on a bun that allowed you to eat it and didnt fall apart."}
{"text":"Been driving by this place for a month now, practically drooling because the smell filling the street on green valley pkwy in front of their shop. Finally stopped in last night. Best brisket in Las Vegas! Mac n cheese was really good also. So glad to finally have a good BBQ joint in the area. Peach cobbler, banana pudding, and fries were all amazing too! Can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying their food after passing by for months now, and commenting about the mouth watering BBQ smell wafting from their outdoor smokers. It is the best BBQ we've ever eaten!!! The spareribs were finger licking delicious, seasoned with a tasty dry rub and cooked perfectly. The meat literally fell off the bone. They packaged the extra large rib racks with plenty of juice. The tri tip was sliced thick and juicy, also seasoned with a bit of spice. We got their side BBQ sauces (sweet and spicy) which were perfect as a mop sauce for the tri tip. Next time we'll try the brisket. I'm sorry we didn't order that as well because the meat we did get was so extraordinary. I'd also recommend the homemade baked beans, coleslaw, potato salad and Mac & cheese. You could make a meal on the Mac & cheese.  It was creamy, with extra cheese  just like I remember grandma's. And get ready for plenty of leftovers because they aren't shy with the portions. Thank you for being so accommodating and helpful explaining your menu when we placed the order. We took a chance because we typically never get take out for a holiday meal. You made our Easter memorable! We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Bar B Que!!! Can't get enough of this place. Great Service ! Great Food !"}
{"text":"Stopped here to get a taste of the future grand opening. The Boss was friendly and is from Atlanta, GA. They were out of the ribs til the new batch so I got a Pulled Pork sandwich. The taste was excellent and I will be back to try other menu items. I am looking forward to the full menu when the permanent store opens."}
{"text":"The Best BBQ spot in Las Vegas hands down! I frequent this place often. You can smell the BBQ from blocks away! The brisket is off the hook!!! You can even buy several BBQ meats by the pound! Good for a family dinner. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've passed by this place quite a few times but never stopped for one reason or another.  Our family did go to Sin City BBQ a couple of weeks ago, which is right around the corner from Boss's and we were not at all impressed, especially for the price.  A coworker stopped in at Boss's today and picked up a rack of ribs and brought them into the office for lunch, and Holy Cow (ahhhemmm, excuse me, Pig!),  these are hands down the best ribs I have ever had, and I am pretty good with a  smoker and rack of baby backs myself.  I love seeing small independent places like this doing such an amazing job.  I can't wait to stop in for myself and try all the other stuff that I am sure is just as delicious as their pork ribs.  Great Job Guys!"}
{"text":"Brisket. Cheese sauce.  The brisket meat is soft and smokey, reminiscent of Hawaii kalua taste. The sandwich is served with a mound of this smokey lusciousness on a white thick soft oval bun. The bbq sauce is served on the side. I can imagine how tasty the pork is.  Got a smoked chicken salad. The chicken was shredded with almost cubed, mouth sized crispy iceberg lettuce. Onion, shredded cheese and tomato bits decorate the chicken.  I ordered a side of the melty cheese, yummmm. Not salty, spicy or grainy. Smooth, delightful creamy yellow cheese to go over their nacho's or sandwiches.    Variety of bbq and mustard heat levels to choose from. In and outdoor seating. Pal liked the bathroom theme."}
{"text":"This is the best bbq in Vegas!!!!!! Excellent customer service and the food is on point!!!!!! I recommend that everybody in Vegas needs to hit this spot up ASAP!!!!! Real talk!"}
{"text":"My husband loves BBQ I try to hit all of the new places popping up around town. The location is just down the road from the busy intersection of Sunset and Green Valley. The shopping center looks a little sketch from the outside, but the inside of the restaurant was clean. The décor is simple and the restaurant provides a comfortable spot to enjoy a meal.   The experience was a bit mixed for us so I'll break it down into the good and bad.   The good was the Pulled Pork Sandwich. It had the perfect amount of marbling to add flavor and was plenty tender. Both the regular and spicy BBQ sauces were delicious. I loved the Baked Beans which had nice pieces of bell pepper and onion with a sweet flavor. The Potato Salad was good with a nice texture and flavor. I loved the addition of black and green olives. The Sweet Tea was indeed sweet and my sweet tea loving husband was happy with this. The Hot Link had a nice flavor.  The bad which I'll call the just not so great part. The Pulled Chicken Sandwich had a nice smoky flavor, but was on the dry side. The buns and breads with our meal weren't bad, but they weren't special either. The good of the Ribs was that they were so tender that I couldn't get them onto my plate without the meat falling off the bone. The bad was that we didn't like the flavor and they were the fattiest ribs I've had at any BBQ restaurant. The final thing has to do with availability since they were out of two items we wanted even though we arrived two hours after they opened.   Overall, there were some definite wins with the meal we had. There are just so many good BBQ options in the area that this wouldn't stand out next time I'm craving BBQ."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ I've had in Las Vegas! First visit we ordered the Boss Platter because we wanted to sample a little bit of everything. Well, we got a lot of everything! It was amazing! Chicken, pulled pork sandwich, hot link sandwich, 1/2 slab of ribs (which would be considered a full rack at any other restaurant), side of potato salad, baked beans, 2 rolls and 2 drinks. We added corn bread for $1 which was decadent! I would have paid $5 for the cornbread it was so good! I don't know how to describe the banana pudding because I was so full I had to wait to devour it later, but delish!!!! Even the sweet tea was to die for! All of this for under $35 out the door! You need to hop in the car and drive there now! Yes, wait in the parking lot until they open tomorrow, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!! I've been looking for some good soul food bbq and I found it greens Mac n cheese hotlinks the catfish sandwhich was a whole filet not a catfish finger so glad they are in my neighborhood  welcome great service everyone there was so approachable thank you"}
{"text":"Exceptional BBQ   So happy to have something close to home with such great flavor. The rib meat falls off the bone and tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal for BBQ!! Finally we have a real BBQ place here in Green Valley!! The rack of St Louis ribs is off the charts with meat so tender it falls off the bone. Pulled pork sandwiches are loaded with at least a half pound of the most tender wonderfully smoky flavored pork I have ever had outside of the South. The French fries are hand cut steak fries with the skins on them that are a meal in themselves. Served piping hot a single serving will feed 2 no problem but get a second one because they are so addictive!! Highly recommend this place!! Can't miss the smoker in the parking lot just follow your nose!!"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good ribs coming out of a tent the meat was very tender falling off the bone shit was great LOL the only bad thing is I do not get my side other than that great customer service great quality food loves my ribs"}
{"text":"OK, this is not the traditional Texas style BBQ i am accustomed to. I ordered the brisket and feel like i received a pot roast. If i would have ordered pot roast, I would have thought it was very very good. The meat seems like it is boiled which gives it the softness and juiciness and consistency and texture of a pot roast. If you slow smoke it correctly, you don't have to boil it. Another thing, they had a bucket of Sweet Ray's BBQ sauce in the back. My feeling is if you have a BBQ restaurant, you should make your own sauce. If you want traditional smoked BBQ, Tucky's in Henderson or Rollin Smoke in LV are better. If you want a moist pot roast with over the counter sauce, this place will do."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars: 4 Star potential     From a smoker in front of a small mom and pop BBQ joint off of Green Valley Parkway, there is the scent of barbecuing sweetening the skies over Green Valley at Sunset. This small mom and pop BBQ joint is Boss's BBQ. Apparently the customer has been a Co-Boss. Up until a couple of weeks ago, Boss's BBQ operated outdoors in the exact parking lot. The talented BBQ chefs who created these delicious home cooked BBQ masterpieces out of the smoker did right by the customer who is also the boss. Ultimately they built a reputation that led the Boss inside to the new restaurant.      The funny thing in \"funny\" being interesting is that there are only a scattering of BBQ restaurants under the Henderson skies. It just so happens that at the opposite end of this abandoned Albertson's parking lot there is Sin City Smoker BBQ. When I was in my car breathing in the aroma of BBQ, I followed my instincts instead of my nose which led me to Sin City Smoker. I attribute this to being that this is the BBQ restaurant that my eyes took in when stopping in Chevron.      Last week fellow Yelper Shirley. B asked me if I wanted to meet up for Tri-Tip Tuesday. I was like, \"of course.\" She told me that Boss's BBQ is to the left [south] of 24 Hour Fitness. Based on what I discussed above, \"to the left of 24 Hour Fitness\" meant across the abandoned Albertson's parking lot nearer Chevron. During a hot June afternoon when the temperature gave the inside of the smoker a run for its money, I had second thoughts that this where I was supposed to be. I went on Yelp. Sure enough, Boss was truly to the left of the 24 Hour Fitness.     Lesson learned. I walked into the new restaurant a good 20 minutes before meeting up with Shirley. B. This gave me my first impression of the staff and restaurant. The staff were friendly. They gave me zero attitude over waiting around at a table. They also gave me zero attitude about taking pictures. Around 1:30 on a Tuesday afternoon there was a trifling of customers. I would recognize the one who walked in the doors close to 2 pm. Shirley. B had arrived and it was time to enjoy the BBQ.      Shirley. B had her mind set on the Triple Tip special. Being from the East Coast, I ordered the BBQ brisket sandwich that cost $9. For an additional $2.99 I added a side of cole slaw and fountain Coke.    When it comes to BBQ, I prefer that there is the right amount of sauce. I am not a fan of getting my hands sticky and having to constantly reach for a napkin. I requested not too much sauce. The friendly woman who took my order granted my request. A few minutes later, I was savoring a BBQ brisket sandwich that had just the right amount of sauce. It was less napkins and more meat. The sandwich was laden with savory meat.     We decided to sit at a table overlooking the brick wall to the right and both the counter and future menu to the left. For the record the flaming theme of the wallpaper beneath the counter provides a flamboyant background for food pics. In the future, the large white square on the far left wall will house the permanent menu. It is the subject of the menu that curtails me from granting Boss's four stars at the time of this review.      As Boss transitions into their new home there is a temporary menu. I would prefer to see more variety and consistency in the menu. For example, the menu I photographed on Tuesday differs from the one Stefany. V photographed a couple days further into the week. That is one challenge. The second challenge I am addressing is variety. I would like to see combination meals where the customer can order BBQ chicken with ribs or BBQ pork with brisket. This is commonplace in all the BBQ joints that I have reviewed up to this point. Combining the two menu challenges \"consistently\" and \"variety,\" the menu could use a permanent BBQ burger with fries.   By the time that Shirley. B and I finished our food and decided to continue our yelping adventures down Green Valley Parkway in Sweet Addiction, I left with a sweet impression of Boss's BBQ. Based on my experience in addition to my rating of \"3.5 Stars: 4 star potential,\" I have recommended Boss's to a few people at work."}
{"text":"This place is worth the stop and exploration.  Everything was good. I had the 1/4 rack of ribs. Good even without the sauce. Well seasoned and falling of the bone.  Baked beans and Mac n cheese. Then I'm Platinum status so of course I had to go big. I got all the desserts: chocolate cake, banana pudding and peach cobbler. All good. Even the iced tea (with free refills) was good.  Thanks Derrick and your lovely wife. Derrick, the owner and cook, assisted us at the cash register. Great customer service too. When you visit Vegas, make it a point to stop in. Great for Dreamtrippers to go local too!"}
{"text":"There is nothing bad I can say so 5 stars it is. Just great bbq. I have now come two days in a row and if i stayed closer i would come more. Catfish nuggets great mac n cheese is like having thanksgiving mac again. And the ribs yes u can leave the sauce un touched because the flavor of the meat is just right."}
{"text":"I read the LV Review Journal article about this new restaurant and they made the food sound so good I had to try it.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with Cole slaw for me and pulled chicken sandwich with mac and cheese side.   My pulled pork was juicy and the spices were perfect. I didn't add any condiments. BBQ sauce wasn't needed. The slaw was standard and good.  My son's pulled chicken was also cooked well and excellent spices. Neither of us like the green pepper in the mac and cheese. There was very little green pepper in it but cooked green pepper flavor permeated every bite. It overcame even the bacon in it. Sadly we won't order the mac and cheese again. But we'll definitely be back.  I knew it was a real Southern BBQ when I saw the smoker outside and saw they had real sweet tea. They didn't have lemon for the sweet tea, so I just added lemonade.  The entire restaurant was spotlessly clean. I felt bad that my son made a mess on the floor. There was so much meat in his sandwich he kept spilling it. That's my kind of pit meat sandwich!  I hope they do well and have a long future ahead of them. I highly recommend it. We will be back. Fresh cooked food made with love!"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ! This is where quality meets quantity!   I had the Tri Tip sandwhich with their fries. The fries rivaled Wing Stop's fries. Dip it into their fry sauce and your mouth will explode with flavor. My friends had their ribs and they raved about them."}
{"text":"WOW! Absolute best barbecue place I have been to in Vegas! Super good food from the Ribs to the Mac and cheese, the amazing fries and the sauces! Love it! Wish I would've known about this place sooner!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Had the pulled pork and fries. Everything on the menu looked really good. Good serving sizes and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time today. He got the brisket sandwich and it was delicious! He also got the candied yams and they were pretty good. I got the chicken breast and was disappointed by how dry it was. My macaroni and cheese was also dry. It got to the point where I ordered another meal because I couldn't make it through the chicken. I got the catfish nuggets with fries and was amazed at how much better they were. The hot sauce was fantastic. The nuggets tasted fresh and the fries had a good flavor to them. We also ordered cornbread, which tasted fine but was also on the dry side."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that Boss's is on Postmates!  A co-worker and I were craving BBQ but weren't quite ready to take our lunch break and it was a God send that they had BBQ spots on postmates lol.  We ordered delivery and it came on time nice and hot!  Thanks a lot for that!  Nothing worse than ordering delivery then receiving it lukewarm/room temperature.    So we both got a sandwich (mine pulled chicken, his pulled pork).  I tried the meat by itself before adding the sauce to it and it definitely had the smoky flavour we all know and love.  The BBQ sauce was really good too, perfect mix between sweet and savory.  We both enjoyed our sandwiches.  The combo comes with one side and a drink.  Fair.  He got baked beans and I got macaroni n cheese plus an extra side of potato salad for $2 I think.  He really enjoyed his entire meal.  My sandwich was yummy; however, my sides were not.  The mac had NO flavour...dry and unsalted air-flavoured noodles.  I had high hopes for a BBQ place having good macaroni, but apparently these two don't go hand in hand anymore.  Not the first restaurant I have been to with flavorless mac.  The potato salad was not what I thought of as traditional.  It was potatoes, black olives, and the mix typically used.  Again, no flavour.  The side items were disappointing.  After adding salt, the potato salad was TOLERABLE but that's it.    Not sure if I'll eat their food again.  I think I should try other BBQ around Vegas instead."}
{"text":"Everyone has a personal preference for BBQ and sides. What is great to some, just doesn't cut it for others. As much as I wanted this place to be 5 stars, it just didn't cut it for me. Here's why: Sides:  Mac & Cheese had jalapeños in it. That is not standard. When something is not standard, it should be listed on the menu or told to you when you order. I got home and no one ate it because of that. It also had something red in it.   Potato salad had olives in it. That is not standard. While one person thought it was awesome, all others thought it was not good at all and didn't eat it. I thought it was awful.   Beans and greens tasted like they were right out of a can. Not good... cornbread was average.   The sides ruined it for me. I couldn't get pass that. The sauce was average also.   The good: Service, meat (pulled pork & brisket)  The excellent: Desserts (banana pudding and peach cobbler)  I know it seems like it should have more stars, but the non standard potato salad and Mac & Cheese without letting me know totally ruined it for me. I do hope that they will have a successful business."}
{"text":"First time here and I liked it alot!!! It's a little pricey but may be worth it. Hard to find in this huge shopping center but once you find it, try something, if you like it, get more if not than don't lol. Guarantee you will love most of the stuff here though. I really hope they get deals and specials (Groupons etc) so I can come back every Saturday (it would be greatly appreciated) since it is very pricey hehe. Customer service is good too!!"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ.... Forget Famous Dave's! It has NOTHING on this place. I tried the pulled pork sandwich and hot link! Bomb! Best BBQ in Henderson by Far!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. We've tried every BBQ in town and this is our favorite. I had the ribs last night if you even attempted to touch the bones the meat fell off!!!! The taste was perfect. I highly recommend them. We also had the pulled pork nachos. They were excellent as well. Huge portions and excellent quality. They do sell out of certain items, so get there early."}
{"text":"The bbq here is awesome we had the chicken was delicious and the brisket and the sauce was the bomb!! Owner is from Atlanta you have to try it the food is not baked it is slow cooked."}
{"text":"Every time I come home from work, I smell this place. The lovely aroma of BBQ meats as he cooks outside in the parking lot while they work on the interior place. Probably another month or so until the formal restaurant is ready to go.  I finally stopped by on a Saturday evening and grabbed a half rack of the pork ribs. I was impressed with the juiciness and fall off the bone moisture, and the flavor was really good and did not require sauce. Pretty tasty! I've never had ribs this moist before, that had so much juice....I'm not sure if they are pre-boiled before smoking or what. They did not re-heat well which was disappointing...maybe I should have baked instead of microwaved.   To sum up....great tasting ribs fresh from the grill. Priced fairly at $15 for a half rack which provided enough for two easily. No sides available. Beer and soda yes.   I will be back to try the chicken and pulled pork sandwich. We will see if it goes UP a star or down."}
{"text":"They had great service. Great BBQ. But you better hurry it runs out quick. Better to get there early. If that doesn't tell you how good the food is. Then idk what will"}
{"text":"Appreciate yas responding back Andi was probably only upset the way I was because I haven't had ribs in awhile and had a serious craving going on. Anyway I came by your place today and first off I loved the atmosphere and how friendly everyone was. Secondly...the food..GLAD I CAME BACK!!!!! Best Mac n cheese period. I'm not a fan of the super creamy Mac n cheese and yours was perfect!! The fries...they were really good...fresh cut potatoes is what makes em!! The ribs I though were friggen awesome..my daughter thought they had to much smoke flavor but I loved them. I couldn't even flip them over to take a picture without the bones flying out!! Looking forward to trying the brisket and even though I didn't see it on menu a friend told me about tri tip tuesday lol. Sorry about the first review...just opening I understand glitches between what's going on and what's posted...next time I will make a call first!!"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ. Our office eats Bosses at least once a week. Support this guy cause it's great."}
{"text":"I've tried Boss's a couple of times now and it's been a solid choice each time. I've tried the ribs, pulled pork and pulled chicken and I have to say any are good options. Personally, I liked the chicken the most, then the ribs (they're on the fattier side) and the pork the least, but I also don't eat much pork ever. The sides I've tried (mac n cheese and baked beans) are okay, but the cornbread is pretty good. Whatever you order though, DO NOT forget to get their spicy BBQ sauce. I can drink that stuff. It's a briny, vinegar BBQ sauce that doesn't melt your face off. It's worth getting a sandwich so the bread can soak up that yummy goodness. I would really like to try the desserts but I'm usually too stuffed to order any. They look super good, especially the banana pudding! I'll have to save space or get some to go next time!!"}
{"text":"I accidentally found this place after my detox appt across the street. I've been looking for a good bbq place in Vegas, and this place impressed me beyond my expectations. It definitely has the home cooked meal feel to it. I'm planning to bring my family here for a second opinion next time."}
