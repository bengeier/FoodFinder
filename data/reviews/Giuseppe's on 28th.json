{"text":"The eggplant parmigiana was heavy and not fresh. The pasta on the side was similar to frozen Reames egg noodles. A waste of $14. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"yup, this place is legit. me gusta mucho"}
{"text":"So being a bit of a food snob even for lunch we decided to try this place. One word AMAZING !  Being Italian , most italian food is just \"ok\".  The taste, the spice, the texture was all perfect"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for calamari and so my search brought me to Giuseppe's. What a find. The place was homey. The staff greeted us and we were off to a great experience. The calamari had just the right spiciness and the homemade pasta was the best I've had. AND I live in NYC which has a lot of Italian restaurants. 
I was sorry it was my last night in Phoenix as it
Meant I couldn't return but I suggest you
Should go and enjoy"}
{"text":"Since there are no .5 star options, I'm going to round up in this case... but I think 3.5 would be a fair score.

The food is good enough, but didn't blow me away.  Though, did you see them on \"Diners Drive-Ins and Dives\"?  The pork really does fall of the bone in the Osso Bucco dish.  The garlic bread appetizer consists of 4 pieces of bread, and no real garlic.  The prosciutto and melon was good, but the prosciutto was not as soft, or maybe not as fresh (?) as I've had.  The lasagna is a surprisingly small portion, but is filling enough.  And the chicken parmesan is a giant portion that leaves you with probably too much food for lunch leftovers, but perhaps would be better as dinner the next night.

I thought it was really reasonably priced.  The total including tax and tip for our party of 4 was just under $150 and that included 2 appetizers, a soup, 4 entrees, 1 dessert, and 1 bottle of wine.

You know how you have your \"go-to\" restaurants in your neighborhood?  They're the defaults when you want a decent, reasonably priced meal in a familiar place.  The food may not be the best ever, and there is usually no ambience, but they're close and they fulfill your craving for that type of cuisine.  Well, if this restaurant was in my neighborhood, if it were slightly bigger, and if it had real chairs, it might be my \"go-to\" Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Doesn't matter how good the may be, if you get bad service, the whole evening is ruined. 

This was a return visit, so we knew about the limited seating. The wait was a half an hour, not something I have patience for but since we were with friends, we stuck it out. 

After we were finally seated, it was 45 minutes before we were served our entrees and then we got one by itself and the rest of the table had to wait for theirs. It would be understandable if the whole restaurant was slow, but two other tables who came in after us were served before we were. 

Our server kept saying \"I'm sorry for the wait\" as her mantra.  I'm sorry, too, for a very unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"A storefront in a strip mall hides an amazing Italian restaurant worth the trip.  If when you think Italian you think Olive Garden or Old Spaghetti Factory, get ready for something special.  We were seated outside on a warm spring evening.  A watermelon salad with olives and feta and garlic bread started us out.  We found that although there is a daily menu that if you don't get there early it sells out.  So I didn't get the short-rib goulash I so much wanted.  Instead I had the Bolognese ragu which was amazing.  The home-made pasta  made the dish.  My wife had lobster ravioli in a tomato cream sauce that was equally decadent.  Too much food for dessert, although that menu was very tempting.  Dinner and two glasses of wine topped $60.00 but was well worth it.  Service was exceptional"}
{"text":"Good food, cozy vibe - but I enjoyed it more back when you could bring your own wine (and before the appearance on Food Network brought bigger crowds.)

Ask the server what he/she recommends that particular day.  They're usually honest and are spot on.  And try going later and see if you can have a chat with the owner.  He used to (maybe still does) play with the Phoenix Symphony and has some great stories."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place about a two and a half ago when I was shopping at the neighboring Sprouts.  I generally do not go out for Italian, but decided to give it a try because my girlfriend and I were a bit burned out on some of our other locals.  Let me just that I was wowed.  Their eggplant parm is fantastic -- thinly sliced, breaded, and served on top of a bed of homemade penne pasta. (All of their pasta is homemade in fact)  Their bread was also very good.  It quickly became one of our favorite regular restaurants.  

I loved their eggplant parm so much that it was difficult to stray away from it and try other items on the menu.  When I finally did though, it was equally delicious.  It was penne and parmesan dish with asparagus and red chili flakes.   I highly recommend it. 
My girlfriend loves the lasagne.  The pear salad also is very tasty appetizer.

The waitress Cindi is great.  She always remembers us and treats us likely regular weekly customers even though we only make it over to that neighborhood every couple of months or so.  We really could not ask for more personable service.  The owner is nice as well.

They now have a lot of pictures up from the Triple D visit, but they were very excited about it.  It was a big deal to them and I don't think that should be a knock against them. (Personally, I did not know who the guy was...old school, no cable)  As for the price and food portions, I think that iGiuseppe's is both fair and filling.  We always leave there filled. (Eat more bread or try the pear salad if you are really hungry) As for the price, most plates are between $10 and $14.  For 2 1/2 people (one four year old), we usually wind up spending between $45 and $55, which includes a healthy tip.  This place is far better than some corporate chain in Old Town (Buca's, Olive Garden, Oregano's, etc) and it is worth the money."}
{"text":"What a great night 
Food was amazing service and incredible and atmosphere prefect . We will be back"}
{"text":"Delicious Osso Buco served on housemade fresh pasta. Antipasto was tasty although drenched in dressing. Biggest surprise, beverages other than wine are served in 12 oz clear plastic glasses. Seriously? Plastic glasses? They also put white butcher paper on the tables over the table cloths. Macaroni Grill does that but there they give you crayons to doodle with as you wait for your dinner. A previous review said \"Giuseppe's is a restaurant with an identity problem.\" I concur. It seems like the owner is going for a fine dining ambiance but missing the mark by using plastic glasses and paper coverings to save on tablecloths."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, have not ever had an issue with anything. Don't  understand some of the low star ratings, Feel like people are very opinionated when it comes to Italian food. The food is fresh and tastes great. If your looking for sodium drenched pre-packaged Italian food visit your local \"Italian\" Chain."}
{"text":"I love the meatball subs. The Lasagna is good. Place is small but great food."}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food around! Don't miss it. Food is great and staff is wonderful."}
{"text":"I went to Guiseppe's February 19th with another person.  It was a disappointing dinner.  Water was served in plastic cups and the napkins were paper.  Both dishes we ordered were tasteless -- adding cheese on top did not help.  The dish I ordered was a mushroom \"stew\" over ravioli dough.  The second time I found myself chewing something very gritty, I called the waitress over and told her the food either had sand or broken glass in it. I gave her a piece of the grit I had taken out of my mouth and, after a long examination by the owner & staff, the owner said he thought it was crystallized sugar.  I think it was dirty mushrooms.  Regardless, I then replaced that dish with pasta fagioli, a little greasy with  90% broth.  Not good. The avocado/tomato salad was delicious.  However, I thought an owner who wanted return business would have comped my meal or, at the least, have offered free coffee or dessert.  Nope!  I will not be back."}
{"text":"I arrived early, because of the warnings about how small this place is, and how crowded.  It wasn't crowded when I arrived, but filled up nicely, especially for a Tuesday night, early.  

The service was excellent.  My waitress made excellent suggestions, and was prompt and courteous.  I had the homemade Mozzarella, prosciutto, olive oil and vinegar special as an appetizer, and it was great.  I made up my mind I wanted the squid ink pasta, shrimp, clams, and calamari in a light tomato sauce before I left home, and enjoyed it a lot.  I was talked into a cannoli before I left, and it was as good as any from the Bronx.  The owner walked out for a break when I was leaving, and I learned he was from Riverdale NY, which helps explain why everything was so good.

I'm coming back, next time I'm in Phoenix, or I might just come for the cannolli."}
{"text":"Just stood in line 10 minutes waiting to have valentine's day dinner with my fiance. We weren't acknowledged until an older man, can't even call him a gentleman, approached the increasing line to finally attempt to seat people. He asked me if I had a reservation? I replied calmly do I need a reservation to be seated (as obviously it was busy due to V Day). He says, I asked you a question, do you have a reservation? So I answered, if I had one, I would've said yes. Then he asks me if I'm having a bad day? I say, I was fine until being ignored for 10 minutes without even a hello. He says, can you not see how busy we are? I have never been spoken to so rudely to as a customer. We left immediately. This was my second trip here, the first being about a year ago for lunch where we discovered the service isn't efficient enough to get you in and out in an hour. Will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"This place is great! We went here after seeing it on Diner's Drive Ins and Dives. The place was very small and crowded, but that's because the food is fantastic. Everything is homemade and very good. The lasagna was fresh and so were the raviolis. Prices were also reasonable.

Love and support the local independent restaurants. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I got a take out order last week......worst pasta ever and the garlic toast was terrible.Wasted good money on bad food."}
{"text":"We went on a Monday evening in June and there was no wait. Giuseppe's is a tiny place with maybe 10 tables, and while we were there, there were a total of four other parties. 

We started with an appetizer of Calimari, sautéed in white wine and saved in a red sauce, along with garlic bread. The Calimari was tender and tasty and the garlic bread was great. 

Mom had the Butternut Squash Ravioli, which she loved. Dad had the special, shrimp and arugula with linguine in a red sauce. He said it was excellent.

I had the Spaghetti Neri, squid ink pasta with Calimari, shrimp and clams in red sauce. The squid ink pasta was black, but tasted very delicate and appealing. The seafood was done well and it all came together exquisitely. 

Pros:
Great food, friendly staff

Cons:
Small space with only a handful of tables."}
{"text":"After seeing the segment on Food Network we were very excited to try this place...WHAT A MISTAKE!!
We ordered the Bruschetta, Salad, and the house specialty, Pasta Bolognese ragu.  The Bruschetta  arrived on store bought, thick cut, un-toasted bread.  The tomatoes were not ripe, and the other toppings were very disappointing.  Then came the salad,  which looked as if it were prepared in a preschool cooking class.  There was NO dressing,  the tomatoes were sliced like for sandwiches, and not ripe,  one slice still had the stem!  The carrots were in large inedible chunks.  Finally came the house specialty pasta bolognese.  They claim to use 6 different meats for this, but it looked and tasted like someone had opened a can of wet dog food, heated it up and tossed it with fettucine.  We were so disgusted by our experience that we will never go back.  We never complained, but after our culinary disaster, I had to write this review.
BTW--- Please do not confuse this place with the Scottsdale location, different owner, different menu."}
{"text":"So I just moved down the street from this place a few months ago and wanted to see what all the hubbub was about since their sign says \"Hey Look at me! I was on TV once!  I ordered the chef salad, bruschetta, and a italian sausage sub for the bf. Drove home, ran up my stairs and excitedly opened my salad.  NOOO, utter disappointment. Where's the meat? Where's the freshly grated parmesan? Yes, I should've read the fine print where it clearly states there is no meat as the waiter told me when I drove back there in my pajamas, but I stopped at Chef Salad ( it happens) Where I come from a chef salad means salami, ham, turkey, egg, and a variety of cheeses. Apparently at Giuseppe's that just means you ordered a $9 salad with nothing on it (ok so it had like 3 black olives, canned tomatoes, and Kraft shredded mozzerella). Great. The italian sausage sub was nothing special. In fact, I could've gone to Fry's, bought the 3 ingredients that is required for $4 and it probably would have tasted better. Actually, I know it would of. The \"best\" part was the bruschetta, but once again I could have easily bought my own texas toast, thrown it in the oven with some gorgonzola and honey on it and called it magnisimo italiano! I should've known that they let just about anyone on tv now a days.."}
{"text":"A great local find. We saw Giuseppe's on 28th. on a local television show discussing local restaurants. We were looking for a place to go for our daughter's birthday and Giuseppe's seemed like a good idea. Was it ever! It is a small Italian Restaurant in a strip mall. When we arrived the staff was extremely friendly. They were very attentive and able to suggest a very nice bottle of wine, that was really good. The food is outstanding. The homemade pasta is delicious and prepared very well, a nice al dente. The bruschetta appetizer was fresh and tasty. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food you receive. The owner Richard was walking around chatting with everyone and making us feel very welcome. It is a restaurant that will now be on our repeat list. We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"I gave Giuseppe's this low rating not because of the food because we didn't eat there, but for the rude way we were greeted. The server acted annoyed that we didn't want to eat outside in 105 degrees. We had said we would wait at most likely exaggerated 45 min wait time. He didn't ask us if we would like a drink, just plain rude. Don't know if I will ever go back to see if their food is as good as people say."}
{"text":"Wow! Tiny little place in a strip mall serving up great Italian food! The Risotto Rice Balls are delicious. Service is friendly - and welcoming. Give it a try?"}
{"text":"Rude server obviously upset that we were not spending tons of money.
Terrible bruschetta.
Extremely overpriced.
EXTREMELY overpriced.
If you are going to charge $15 for mac & cheese, please provide me with something other than a paper napkin and a plastic cup."}
{"text":"I have no idea how anyone could give this place less than five stars. Unless you were expecting it to actually be Italy?

It's in Phoenix. Hello? It's next to a Water and Ice. If you're expecting a five star hotel then you're going to the wrong place. If you are a true foody and love hole in the wall-owner serves you-best italian food in AZ type places then this is your place.

The bruchetta is AMAZING. I don't know where they get their tomotoes, but I would gladly give a whole month's salary to find out.

The Bolognese Ragu is so so so good. I can't order anything else. My husband always gets the chicken parmsean with the homemade pasta and it's to die for. I think the prices are right for what you're getting. I would gladly pay $200 for the bolegnese ragu.

The desserts are amazing as well. All I can say is if you love food and your in this area GO."}
{"text":"So, the service was awesome! Super friendly and attentive. Food was delivered quickly. We had the pasta ragu and spaghetti with meatballs (subbed house made pasta). Both were devoured. The plates were plentiful without being obnoxious in portion. The finale was the to die for tiramisu. It was amazing! Almost liked the plate clean. Can't wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"Avoid. Expensive wine list and our waiter pulled a wine scam on me.  The wine list here is ridiculously expensive. I ordered the least expensive bottle of Chianti for $32 ( what they call \"house\",  and this is not a fancy place) and I got attitude for it!  Our waiter asked: \"Wasn't I sure I wanted the next step up at $38?\" I did not want to pay more. Even after I accepted the tasting, the wandering owner of the place shot our waiter a look like \"dig Mr. Cheapskate over there...\" The waiter poured three half glasses from our bottle. Then the waiter took the bottle away. ( Bad sign, in retrospect) When I asked for the rest of the bottle, he said we finished it! I know wine bottles and there were  more than three half glasses in that bottle. I asked if he was sure and he said yes. Rather than create a scene with my party - a buzz kill for sure to argue over this -  I ordered three more glasses  - at an additional $24. The waiter opened a new bottle, poured, and guess what, there was about a half bottle left!  I was not happy! Not happy about the brazen attitude for ordering a $32 bottle or the very short first bottle. I think I was scammed.  Every order should be respected. The food was good, I admit, and reasonably priced but it must act as a lure to soak you on the wine. They do carry out and this would be the only way to enjoy this place, in my opinion.Better yet, try someplace else."}
{"text":"First, this place is very small and though accommodating, a little too crammed in there. They would benefit from taking at least one table out so that customers and servers can maneuver to and from the tables. The  server we had last night was awesome...very friendly and made our experience great. The food was ok. We started with a house salad that was seriously over-dressed. I had the bolognese and my boyfriend had the baked ziti. My pasta seemed homemade and the sauce was a tad bland but still pretty good. The baked ziti was good. Nothing special. I felt it was quite over priced. $50 for one salad, garlic bread, and two mediocre pasta dishes. Not sure if we will return because there just wasn't anything special about the place other than Diners, drive-ins and dives went there. I'd sure like to know what Guy ordered. I also think they have a new owner so I can't compare it to how it used to be."}
{"text":"Gosh dammit.  It was so good I went there by myself to eat during a business trip."}
{"text":"Was very excited about getting the Bolognese ragu pasta... Most of the reviews were excellent. Key word is \"most\". UberEats was incredibly fast as usual...... Unpacking I was a little disappointed with the amount of pasta being a bit more than an appetizer.... No big deal, it's the flavor of great italian food I was looking for....... At first bite I was severely disappointed. It was tasteless and devoid of flavor. Felt like I was eating mushed up McDonalds hamburger meat with some pasta around it. Actually, MecD's would've had more taste. Never again."}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian i've had in AZ. Love the bruschetta gorgonzola cheese with honey, the butternut squash ravioli, and the Orvieto Classico Malvasia wine."}
{"text":"The paper napkins and plastic cups did not match the high-priced $15 - $20 pasta dishes on the menu. Each table had a flameless candle which seemed pointless because the lights above were as bright as a factory. We had the bean soup and the gnocchi with the tomato cream sauce.  The soup was fair but the gnocchi was definitely lacking a bit of flavor, I had to add salt. I asked for bread in which the waiter replied he could bring out some basic bread or if we wanted some amazing garlic bread it would only be $4 bucks. So of course I had to taste what was so amazing about this garlic bread. It was not amazing in the least, just garlic-infused olive oil drizzled over thinly sliced white bread that was barely toasted. We also ordered a lemon-lime Italian soda which kinda made me gag. It wasn't sweet, more sour and tasted slightly bitter. 3 stars is generous of me for this overly-boasting \"As Seen on the Food Network\" restaurant.  I say work on the ambiance, cutlery and ingredients and maybe then you can justify your prices."}
{"text":"Rarely does a restaurant exceed my expectations; however my visit to Giuseppe's was one of those rare occasions. The staff could not have been more welcoming and friendly. Our waiter Steven was EXCEPTIONAL. He was helpful and extremely knowledgeable regarding the food and the wine list. The food was fantastic top to bottom. Everything tasted fresh and bursting with flavor. I shared the \"Da California\" salad with a friend (Avocado & Cherry tomatoes, Black Olives).  It was absolutely delicious. I ordered the Bolognese Ragu that Giuseppe's is famous for (six meats) served over fresh made pasta. If I had to request a last meal this might be it, the Bolognese Ragu was phenomenal the pasta was perfect. I travel almost every week and eat at places all over the country and this has to be one the best experiences I've ever had. I will be going back as soon as I get back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I miss this place so much. Im in Bay Area now, and I think of Giuseppe's bolognese sauce almost every weekend. 

Their simple tomato sauce is sooooooo good. Wish I knew the recipe. And the eggplant appetizer is to die for. 
YUMMY 

I miss you guys"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Friendly Staff! Order Spaghetti Neri, it's out of this world!!! Look for Richard he will take good care of you!"}
{"text":"Went here last night as recommended by our kids but we could not get service. Walked in and they had a couple of tables for 2 open and we had 4. The staff said only seating outside for right now. So I went back out and sat at a table my husband ask to put our name on the list and they said that was outside too. Sat there for 20 minutes or so with no water or staff coming out to us. When they did come with 2 waters I said thank you but we are not staying no help and you sent us out here 20 plus minutes ago. He says \" you have a party of 4 right\" I say yes but here are 2 customers in the AZ heat you sat outside and did not check on us until now. It was hot on the patio no misters. Not rushing to go there again!"}
{"text":"If you don't love Guissepe's, you don't love Italian. Kindly find your way to a chain restaurant that serves bland, unseasoned, frozen-then/microwaved meats, sauces that are fit for an old folks home and an \"endless\" pasta and salad bar. Go to these places, because Guissepe's is not for you.  It's for lovers of true Northern/Northeast American Italian cuisine. Chicken Parm that is fried, NOT baked, thank you very much. Meatballs that use beef, veal and pork. Sauce that use LOTS of salt, as it should be. Leave your dietary worries at home.

 In a word: perfecto.

Robert's passion for music (he's a well known accomplished cellist in NY circles) and food is unparalleled. He is without peer in the state of Arizona. 

But be warned... there ain't no endless pasta bowl here.
 
Their weekday lunches are equally superior. This is Italian the way we had it growing up in North Jersey."}
{"text":"There was a longer wait than we were used to but the food was superb. The people who went with me all enjoyed their food very much. The dessert was excellent as well. I hope to come back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This place has nothing going! They don't know basic importance about Italian bread. It's disgusting places like this are open and people rave about it. Guy would be ticked if he saw what they're serving. It sure ain't money baby any more or on point. Also it's pricy ! I think they got a license to steal !"}
{"text":"Best pasta I've ever had at a restaurant.
Service was too slow otherwise it would have 5 stars.
Go!"}
{"text":"some of the best pasta you will ever have in a place you wouldn't expect it. The pasta is amazing and it's made fresh daily.  the bruschetta is also really good. I always get the carbonara or the bolognese. Come hungry cause the big portions will fill you up pretty quick."}
{"text":"Well I got bamboozled into trying this place by my lady after an episode of triple d . I should have went with my gut and left when the server brought out plastic cups with flex straws that it wasn't  going to be a good experience . She was told to get there early because at certain times of the day there's a line to get in which is true I'm assuming considering there's room for about 15 people in the dinning area . I ordered spaghetti and meatballs pasta was dry sauce was a little rich and the meatballs were a little on the salty side. Very diss appointing my boy ordered lasagna and my girl ordered one of the specials on the board and our friend ordered the same as myself spaghetti and meatballs . With an order of garlic bread which came out way to early so it sat getting cold . So when the bill came out it was a whopping $90. Don't  get me wrong I don't mind paying good money for good food but this time I totally felt robbed . I would not go to this place again if someone else was paying ."}
{"text":"The food is so-so to average ....... and then it falls off the cliff .......

       *Signs all over the place ....... about The Food Network
       
If you have an yen for an OVER-RATED experience ....GO
                    You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I have never written a review before but felt i had to.  This place sucks!  Went here with 3 other friends for dinner.   My osso buco was below average, flavorless, and dry.   We had garlic bread which was 5 pieces of cold, stale french bread drizzled with olive oil and dried oregano.  R u kidding me??  My guests were disappointed with their dishes as well and the dinner was not deserving of such high prices.  Some of it came out cold!   Dinner for 4 of us was WAY overpriced.  Only thing good was desert.  Service was just OK, but he didnt take much time to check on us.  The owner thinks he's a 5 star chef.  Gimme a break dude.  Plastic water cups with these prices??  Go to North, or any other place for that matter.  Sign out front is super tacky.  Guy Fieri must have been stoned when he reviewed this place, or else the quality has sunk.  I believe it was years ago anyways."}
{"text":"FINALLY! GOOD ITALIAN FOOD IN PHOENIX!!!

And I say Amen to that!

Moving down here from a town where I could get constant, and diverse, good Italian food was a major let down. Mormon influence has turned Phoenix into Henry Hill's worst nightmare. But Giuseppe's hits it out of the park."}
{"text":"Giuseppe's was great the food was one of the best Italian Food I have every had. The Lasagna hit the spot. The service was good our waiter made one mistake but he fixed it. It was a great experience. We also wanted to go to a Italian Restaurant
 that was casual and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Don't get the pork shoulder! Had hair (from the pig) on the outter skin. Wasn't butchered properly obviously. Very tough and dry. Never coming back. Even baked ziti was just fair."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant after learning of it from Diners Drive Ins and Dives TV show.  The food was FANTASTIC!  Love the little place and the atmosphere.  However, the menu is a bit pricey as it was $70 dollars for two persons (including desert and appetizer).   In all, a very pleasant experience and the good was very good!"}
{"text":"Didn't come close to our expectations. Went there last night for the first time. Bruschetta was served on garlic bread. I ordered a Moretti beer and got a dark lager (and in a beer goblet way less than full). We order the cavatelli and the eggplant parm- neither had been touched with the requisite Italian herbs. The sauces were plain, boring, and way to heavy with the tomato concentration. To top things off, the fresh pasta was rubbery and the lights kept dimming off completely while we ate.Why the hype? My Italian home cooking is much better and I'm a novice."}
{"text":"Please ignore the 3 1/2 star rating. And please ignore that Marvin dude's review from November of 2011. He clearly has some involvement in the \"other Giuseppe's\" and his opinion seems a bit biased.

Some quick points you must know...

Incredibly passionate and friendly owner. He literally walks around all night talking to each table. But it isn't the annoying kind of conversation. It's genuine. I've never left a restaurant feeling happier about the meal and the owner.

Incredibly authentic food. THE best Italian food in the Phoenix area. If you're familiar with the owner's background, you know his knowledge of Italian food is for real. Also a fantastic wine list and some solid beer offerings.

Incredibly cool atmosphere. I've never been to Italy but I grew up near Boston and whenever we wanted truly Italian food, we went to the North End. My brother and I felt like we were there. It's nice to be ten feet from where your food is prepared, cooked, and served.

I would not hesitate for a second to recommend this to a friend or a stranger."}
{"text":"LOVVVVVED this place! My table ordered the Bolognese Ragu and Macaroni & Cheese and loved it. Topped it off with the Tiramisu. The owner is great and walks around and talks with everyone. Our server was really nice and helpful. The place is small and they don't take reservations but there is a sports bar 30 sec away where we waited until the owner called us and said he had a table. We were told it'd be a 45-60 min wait but it was more like 10 min. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Pricey, overpriced compared to other higher quality Italian restaurants.
For the money people pay, the restaurant needs remodeling and is too small for the fare served.Tile and walls chipped. Bathroom needs update.

Prior owner was very jovial with patrons..fun atmosphere.. gave larger portions for the price and treated his employees like gold with paid sick days, paid vacation, Holiday bonuses and raises. There are many customers like me that have been lost with current owner and will not come back."}
{"text":"this is a great little restaurant if you're looking for genuine italian cuisine and not the chain restaurant versions tweaked for american taste.  very casual friendly atmosphere, but very small and neighbor-hoody with spartan decor.  Wish the chairs were a little more comfortable, but then the food makes up for it.   a rare find in phoenix.  worth the drive if you know the difference between average and very good italian."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I stopped in at Giuseppe's for lunch this week because we were visiting a store in the same shopping center and saw the sign hanging out front about them being featured on a show on the Food Network.  I did see the show and had been meaning to stop so it seemed like a perfect time.

I expected to be blown away and was a little disappointed.  The salad was pretty good but nothing spectacular...we're talking your basic iceberg lettuce with tomatoes and a very nice Italian dressing.  I had a chicken dish with fettucini which, while there was a lot of it, was bland and oily and the chicken was dry and way overcooked.

I'm from Chicago (as it seems like most Phoenicians are) and have experienced excellent Italian so know there has to be something better in the valley.  Maybe their sandwiches are better or maybe I just ordered one of their \"eh\" dishes or maybe the \"chef\" (cook) was having an off day.  So, in my opinion Giuseppe's is barely average food and way over priced.  Skip it unless you're starving and nothing else is open."}
{"text":"If you come here and don't get the freshly made pasta, you have made a serious mistake. The dish with the sausage and broccoli rabe is unbelievably good. The macaroni and cheese is wonderful and the Bolognese Ragu is so tasty. Try the suppli di Riso for a different experience, which are these rice balls with mozzarella and then fried."}
{"text":"The food has no taste.  I went here for my birthday because we saw it on TV.  I have no idea how anyone can give this place a good rating.  If you like tasty food please go somewhere else.  Not even my 3 year old son liked it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite nice casual restaurants.   This is the type of Italian food you'd get in great little out-of-the way Tuscan hill town restaurants that serve the locals (not the tourist traps).  It's always a relaxed friendly atmosphere and the food is always awesome.  As several reviewers have mentioned, don't forget to BYOB - but no worries if you do because you can grab some at Sprout's next door.    The owner plays in the Phoenix Symphony, and he knows his Italy!"}
{"text":"Scuse me sir..... May I have som more please...

Homemade, fresh, well prepared... And yea a bit expensive.... 

This is so aaaaa ,,,,,,get what you pay for situation here folks....

Bolognese amazing....

I could go on but.... Geeez get up get out and get some....."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  Ill start with our first impression... my dad walks to the patio entrance ahead of us and is asked how many in his party, the tells him 8.  The man tells him we should have called ahead.  We are there for a short time while he put two tables together, while he is moving things around the owner comes and asks my dad how many.  My dad tells him 8 and starts to tell him they are setting it up and them the man says, OK how many? I don't know if he thought he was kidding but we then said 8 and we are being seated.  Not a great start, no eye contact and an awkward encounter, we are then seated.

I dont know if they do not have beverages but we were never offered, water was brought out for all as we sat. We ordered an overly expensive rice ball for our appetizer and garlic bread, neither warm or good in flavor.  Let me start by saying the food that was eaten was not restaurant quality. It was more like I came to your house for dinner meaning it was every day food, nothing to brag about, nothing special. 
We then order dinner, my dad and I split a seafood pasta and our waitress so kindly had them put it in two bowls. This was the best and only good part of our experience as we didn't ask, good thinking and active listening on her part. 

Our food comes, remember there are 8 of us so lots of food. Only 1 dish was hot. Mac and cheese and lasagna are obviously premade (expected) but not hot. Butternut squash Ravioli it's self was good but lukewarm,  drowning in a sea of what was to be brown butter but actually tasted of burnt oil. Soup, nothing to brag or spend time on and the baked ziti with sausage while hot, nothing special. 

The dish we split was their seafood with black pasta, not hot but I enjoyed it until my dad said \"that doesn't look good\" On our shell plate he puts down a clam. I look at it thinking what I was looking at was maybe an herb or something and so I picked it up and I smell it, horrible but tar like smell. It dripped on the plate a black substance. The clam was obviously not good, rotted. Now I understand the chances here, it's she'll fish. I expected to tell the woman waiting on us and she say, I'm sorry let's get you a fresh plate but I got a \"oh, let me see this\" she took it and showed the man who set up our table. He says you gotta talk to Rich, I believe that's the owners name. 

Now at this point wed been there a. While, the owners talking to his patio and inside guests, visiting each table but ours and the two behind us. He's very friendly and very talkative,  it took about 10 minutes for him to finally be free so she could let him know we had a situation. He comes to me and asks how he can help, I started to tell him about the clam and he tells me he saw it like it was nothing. I told him it was gross and before I could say more he got argumentative.   Asks what I want him to do, I let him know that we did not want to finish the food given the situation.  He tells me, \"it's not in your food\" this upset me, it was at one point and it dripped out. He says it was a bad clam, I'm not going to defend myself,  do you want something else. I hear the line, I'm not going to defend it or myself a few times. He asks again, do you want something else as he abruptly takes our plates and I told him no, we would like our check seeing his attitude just walked my appetite. He walked away and didn't look back. The waitress asked if he took care of us in short i said no and we wanted to leave.  She apologised for him.  It took 10 minutes to then get a box for my stepmothers ziti so we could get the heck out. Note it took one minute to get the check when requsted. He had no problem taking our money.  $80 plus dollar tab for crap. What's worse is all he had to do was say, I'm sorry there was a bad clam. Let me remake it or something else for you.  I wasn't looking for a handout. Instead I got this, horrible. 
Lets put it this way, It's 6am and I've already told 4 people NEVER to go here. Take a lesson in kindness sir.  We the customer are your business."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great meal.  He ordered the Bolgnese and I had Brushetta.  You can order different types of Brushetta because you get 4 pieces.  Anyway they offered chicken liver.  I never tried it before so I chose it as one of my options.  I didn't like it. It was no fault of theirs I just do not have a pallet for it.  I told Cindy our server and she immediately ordered a replacement for me at no extra charge.  Thanks Cindy.  A great place."}
{"text":"My first review and I am not happy. Went there last evening because I had heard so many good things including Check Please. Dumpy little place but I was there for the food. Just two of us   ... the rice balls were awful and when I said to the waiter  he did nothing about it. Did not take them off the bill.  Only thing good was the key lime dessert which was lovely.  Will NEVER go back to this place.  Very disappointed atmosphere  food service and price."}
{"text":"If anyone ever asks you where your favorite italian food is just go ahead and tell them Giuseppe's on 28th! Trust me when I tell you that you cant find anything this side of NYC or the North end of Boston that even comes close! 
Small and comfortable local eatery, home made pasta that blows the mind and a meat sauce that has 7 kinds of meat. LOVELY!
Do yourself a favor and stop in this joint for some eggplant and glass of wine, it will change your day!

enjoy!

{"text":"We've been here twice.  The bruschetta is unremarkable, nothing to get excited about.  The caesar salad was very good.  We had the shrimp ravioli and the ravioli quartet.  The ravioli was excellent - definitely the highlight of the meal.  The portions are a little small given the price.  For desert we had the flourless chocolate cake with spumoni - an interesting combination.  The flour less cake was like a brownie and it was okay.  The spumoni was very good.

All in all we enjoyed the meal, however I don't think the quality or quantity overall measures up to the prices.  Just the same, we'll probably go back - those ravioli were really good!

One other note, we didn't ask but I'm guessing it was just an usual issue, we were served our drinks (ice tea and sprite) in little plastic cups."}
{"text":"Despite the media spotlight, I had not heard of Giuseppe's on 28th until Monday night.  With time to kill and looking to fill my stomach I asked for a recommendation from a bartender and he sent me to Giuseppe's.

I found a small restaurant in a shopping center.  My guess is this place is packed and stuffy if you go at a peak hour.  I was there before 5pm so only a few of the tables were occupied.

The waitress was prompt with menus and drinks.  Friendly too.

Bolognese Ragu was my dinner selection.  The sound of homemade pasta is sauce and six meats sounded fantastic.  I was given a basked of fresh Italian bread while I awaited my dish.  The bread was fresh and tasty (from a local bakery according to the website).  I am partial to oven fresh bread so I was slightly disappointed at first but, hey, you can't always have it 100% to your taste.

I was very impressed with the ragu.  Granted, I have nothing else to compare it with but I loved it.  

So, why only 3 stars?  I'd like to give 3.5 but I can't so it gets 3.  The prices were not satisfactory.  The ragu and a can of coke came out to over $21 with tax.  For the price I paid I found the portion a bit small and $3 for a can of Coke is lunacy.  I understand a local restaurant needing to charge more but I think they could shave some of the cost off.  Especially on the pop.  To be honest, the prices will keep me away for a bit.  I'd love to try more of the menu but I can't afford to eat here too often.  One day, though, I will return.  If money is of know object to you, knock 'em dead and have a great dinner."}
{"text":"We had the signature bolognese, spaghetti and meatballs, and the penne al salmone.  I'm not Italian but I know that all the dishes we had tonight were made from scratch and with great ingredients."}
{"text":"Homemade pasta and Osso Bucco.  That's all you need here.  This place is a hidden gem even after being featured on Triple D.  Love coming here for an authentic Italian Dinner with top notch service from the owner.  Doesn't get any better than that."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants that reminds me a lot of the little Italian family style restaurants you can find in little Italy and other places around NYC. I come here about 3-4 times a month to get my Italian fix:) The staff is super friendly and treats you like your family. The owner, Richard, is often there and loves to talk so get ready for a great conversation about the history of the restaurant etc!  Its a very small restaurant and seating is limited. I personally like sitting inside because its warm and cozy! There is outside seating but it looks out onto a shopping center parking lot which to me is not appealing to me at all. The food here is AMAZING! Portions are quite large and can easily be spit in half to share. They have been on the TV show Diner, Drive-ins and Dives, which is where I got my motivation to make the drive over there. I would recommend the calamari to start and/or the bruschetta, which offers 4 choices of toppings. For the main course I always get the Spagetti Neri, which is squid ink pasta with a TON of seafood. If you like seafood this is definitely the dish for you! The Bolognese is also an excellent choice. To top it off at the end of my meal I like to take a conolli, which is always made fresh and oh so yummy!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at this establishment last night (Saturday, January 18th)!  We live right around the corner, this was our first visit, and we absolutely LOVED it!  Best Italian food I have had since Italy and Boston's North End  We were told there was a 30 minute wait, but we were seated in about 15.  The pasta made me especially happy as it was perfectly done, not overcooked, and for whatever reason NO ONE MAKES IT HOW THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO!  Ok, rant over  We had the melazana (thin sliced eggplant appetizer) which was perfect. I've never had better. We also shared a bruschetta sample and the one with chicken liver pate was especially terrific! My fiancé had pasta with salmon and asparagus and I had the wild boar ragu.  Both were delicious.  Our tab came in at under $65.00 and we also had four Americanos.  The service was a little scattered, but just fine for such a busy time of night.  Part of this places charm is the East Coast matter-of-fact attitude and banter of the entire staff:  owner and waitstaff.  My fiancé and I have been searching for a little romantic restaurant to call \"our place\" and this is definitely it.  We sat on the beautiful little patio and enjoyed the unseasonably warm January weather (space heaters were provided).  it doesn't feel stuffy or pretentious and I didn't have to dress up (which is rare for such a high quality meal).  Thank you so much for a wonderful evening!  We can't wait to go back and try different menu items."}
{"text":"Went there tonight.  Should have been a red flag when we walked in on a Tuesday evening at dinnertime (5:30pm) and the place was empty.  Only two stars, and that was only because of the service. We decided to try it since seeing it on Food Network.  Way overpriced ($17 for ravioli and about $13-15 for my macaroni - don't remember the price, however, the macaroni wasn't really macaroni. He used the same fettucini noodles he used for the other dishes).  I was going to order the gnocchi, but after finding out it was frozen and brought in by another outside kitchen, I opted out.  I make my own gnocchi at home and any italian restaurant who doesn't, is a phony.   Drinks are brought to your table in cans with plastic cups and ice (probably so they don't have to give you refills), which was surprising considering the prices.  Very, very disappointed.  My macaroni & cheese was swimming in oil (or butter)....literally swimming!!!  I didn't eat mine. My husband said his ravioli was good (should be, for the price).  All said, I wouldn't go back again, but at least I can say I tried it.  The waitress tried to make it right by offering me a replacement or a dessert, but I opted to just eat the bread at the table.  Just the two of us and after tax and tip $50 (two entrees, appetizer and two cans of coke).  Waaay too much money for unhealthy italian (didn't think it was possible to make italian unhealthy...oh, well). My husband insisted on driving straight to Red Devil but instead we went to the QT for some lottery tickets and after looking behind us at the \"hot food\" section, decided we should have gone with the $2.00 pizza at QT and saved ourselves lots of money.  We're not picky eaters either, but this was, as Guy Fieri always says, \"out of bounds\" and not in a good way."}
{"text":"Ok I'm from the east coast. You can't beat our Italian.

But if I were to live here. I would come here. Ive had better in the east coast but this was good for AZ.

We ordered the Osso and the Bolognese.
Pasta was very good. 4 stars!
OSSO wasn't tender enough. 

Very humble eatery. But packs.a punch.

Wish I had another stomach to try the squid ink pasta they had.

Prices were good."}
{"text":"Mangia here ASAP! Giuseppe's is a small establishment with a big hearty taste! Pure Italiano, the food is fantastico - highly recommend the bolognese ragu with homemade pasta and seven meats, the osso buco is massive and delicious, the butternut squash ravioli is the perfect savory/sweet combination and ricotta cavatelli with rapini has the best flavor. Take a lemon-zested cannoli to go! The best part of dinner is meeting and chatting with the humbly charming owner Rich. Ask him his story of playing cello to making limoncello. We're bringing the entire Italian family back!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here numerous times over the last couple of years.  Tonight food was good but not great.  But what bothered us the most was the lack of bread.  No I will not pay for bread especially when I am paying over thirty dollars for two pasta dishes!  Other Italian restaurants offer bread as part of the meal and in some cases either a choice of salad or soup.  But not providing bread as part of the meal has made this our last visit.  I'll pay $30 for pasta but not $4 for something that should be part of the meal."}
{"text":"$21 for very fishy seafood.with squid ink pasta.
If I charge this much I would make sure all seafood are fresh.
Some mussel and clam were not opened.This is a sign if do not smell fishy seafood.
Did not come with salad ,garlic bread.
Very disappointing.
Patio seating were bad also.cheap plastic chair.No table cloth.
We have to adjust uncomfortable plastic chair and wipe fake candle on the able."}
{"text":"I was visiting and went for lunch with a friend as I had heard they had amazing Bolognese, one of my favorites. The place is in a strip mall, as pictured, nothing fancy. No lunch prices or portions, so it was $17, but I have to say it was worth it. 7 kinds of meat. Truthfully, I think it was the best Bolognese I've ever had. Service was good, but we were trying to have a conversation and the very sweet waitress kept interrupting us. Might have been better if it was busier.
Would I go back? Absolutely.
Would I recommend? Definitely."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place but my boyfriend and I went here and were very disappointed. He ordered the shrimp risotto and it had a fowl odor and It was bland. I ordered the mixed meat pasta they said it's the dish they are \"known\" for. It also tasted very plain and it tasted like something I could get from a freezer dinner. Not impressed, will not go back."}
{"text":"I was in the Phoenix area for baseball spring training and was looking for a unique restarant experience.  As a huge fan of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, I could not pass this restaurant up, as I had never had a bad experience at a restaurant that Guy Fieri had recommended.  I went there with several friends (party of 6, including children).  

My friend and I started with the house salad, which consisted of mixed greens with a very heavy oil vinegrette on it.  The mixed greens were fresh and tasty, but there was so much oil left on my plate after eating the salad, that I used it with the Italian bread that was served to the table before the main course.

Across the table, we ordered the spaghetti, maccaroni and cheese, and the spaghetti neri (squid ink pasta with oysters, shrimp, and calamari).  I had the spaghetti neri.  I did not try the other dishes, but they looked and smelled delicious.  The spaghetti neri was fairly tastless in terms of the tomato+wine sauce, and was very bland and dissappointing.  The seafood (oysters in particular) were a bit \"fishy\", similar to sushi purchased in a groccery store (sometimes), but not so bad as to preclude eating.  However, the next day, I wish I had not, I had very bad case of food poisening (fever, vomiting) that night and the next day.  I called the restaurant the next day to let them know their seafood might be bad and the manager/owner (Rich) told me it couldn't possibly be their food.  Since my friend and I ate the same foods that day, except for the spaghetti neri, I am 100% sure it was that dish.

I cannot recommend this restaurant.  I am terribly dissappointed at quality of the food, and the owner's attitude, which was brash and bit defensive.  In fact, he did not agree to remove the remaining seafood from the same batch, so that others may not get sick, as well, though he did offer to send a coupon for a free meal on my next trip.  I can only hope that others did not suffer the same fate as I.  If you do dine here, stick to the spaghetti or maccaroni with cheese, and do not order the spaghetti neri!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably wonderful Italian food... Try the squid ink pasta. It is amazing.  Had dinner with my business associate and was totally impressed."}
{"text":"This is a good lunch place...only been there twice and ordered a meatball sub both times but it was really good and too big for me to finish.  I'll definitely be back for that."}
{"text":"What a joke. We recently moved to this area of Phoenix and thought we would try it one night after seeing the sign that it was on the food network walking out of Sprout's. They charge $3 for bread and it is four small slices of stale french bread. The two pasta dishes had no real sauce or flavor and the prices are ridiculous. 

It was $32 for two pasta dishes and bread. I am so angry right now that I didn't go with my gut feeling and just go to Mamma Mia's. Mamma Mia is similar in price but offers twice the portion and you get the bread for free like a normal Italian Diner. I think this might be the angriest I have ever been after eating dinner out."}
{"text":"Beyond a shadow of a doubt, this is one of the best Italian restaurants I've ever eaten at; if I thought of it - maybe the best!  But hands down, the Osso Buco is to die for and their sauce would give my grandmother stiff competition.  The portion was generous to say the least; I managed to finish my plate, as I was then eating to continue enjoying the delicious  taste.

The waiter was friendly, down to earth, engaging and entertaining.  A warm, cozy atmosphere; very comfortable.

Too bad I don't live in the Phoenix (I was there on business), otherwise this would be my Italian restaurant of choice."}
{"text":"great ambiance, super waiter service, and the owner is right there to greet you and make you feel at home.
the food is a real treat. very much italian at it's best. all homemade in house and well rounded in flavor. great choices in wine and authentic italian spirits. 
we ate there twice within two months while on business in the area.
i can highly recommend this place, and trust me i am pretty picky!"}
{"text":"It's gross.  Don't waste your money please!  Hope this helps you!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try this place for months now. Purchased a Local Dines coupon and went the other day for lunch. First impression was a little strange as there is no table service. You are pleasantly greeted by a nice hard working elderly lady who instructs you to order at the window and then take a seat while your food is prepared. Once the food is ready she beckons to you from across the room so that you can come pick up your food in the window. Not sure if this is just a lunch thing and if dinner service has a different system but once I understood how the system worked it was fine. As for the food... We ordered the famed bolognese ragu over linguine, chicken parm., and fettuccine alfredo. My wife had the bolognese and said it was just okay. The pasta overwhelmed the dish with very little bolognese mixed in so it was a little dry and flavorless, somewhat disappointing. The chicken parm. was actually pretty tasty in my opinion and worthy of ordering again. The fettuccine alfredo was not good at all. Very basic pasta with cream. There was no real taste at all and was a total disappointment. Overall I think that this place rides on the coattails of the triple D review from Guy Fieri. I do not understand the long lines and rave reviews to be honest. Oh, one last thing... As previously mentioned we used a Local Dines $15 for $30 worth of food coupon. When I got the bill at the end the nice older lady added up the food, deducted the coupon amount,then proceeded to add 18% gratuity to the bill based on the total amount without even asking. I have no issue with a tip, but presuming 18% when there is no real table service, just a woman beckoning to you from a window, well I thought that a bit much. Yes, she did come out from behind the window and was very nice, but it was not her position to add 18% tip to a four top table. At the end of the day this place is 35 minutes from my home and in no way justifying of the drive and a follow up visit. Sorry Giuseppe's on 28th, I wish I had found a true hole in the wall to call home, but to the contrary was disappointed with your food."}
{"text":"This was such a pleasant experience. At first we were nervous because of the older decor and computer-printed menus but what a wonderful time we had. Our server, Jose, was awesome. Our gnocchi and bolognese ragu was made with love. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A friend from out of town wanted to eat there so a group of us went here last night. When we got there there was a table open and we were seated immediately but there was a line outside while we were eating. The food was very good, everyone liked it. It was not the best I have ever eaten but still very good. The portions were not large but enough I didn't leave hungry either. Service was reasonable but not great. Considering this is a fairly small place and it was extremely busy I cannot complain. Overall it was a good experiance and we left happy."}
{"text":"Giuseppe's  is a restaurant where the food quality is the most important thing. The restaurant is set and a small storefront is one storefront wide and very informal.  If you are coming here for high-quality traditional Italian food, then you are coming to the right place.  You have to try the osso bucco in order to live a complete life."}
{"text":"I saw Giuseppe's on the food channel and decided to try it with family from New York. Red sauce was good (not too sweet as sauces tend to be in Phoenix) and fettucini alfredo (homemade noodles) was excellent.  However, the portion of fettucini  alfredo was small  enough that a 9 year old inhaled it in minutes.  Ordered sides of meatballs.  $2 for each meatball the size of a golf balls.  We couldn't believe it.  We also couldn't believe that you have to pay for bread in an italian restaurant! The chocolate cake was divine. There is no question that the food is of a good quality--nothing even close to NY but for Scottsdale it is fine.  Giuseppe's should reconsider the price of those meatballs and making people pay for bread--a staple of any Italian meal. ."}
{"text":"Came in because of DDD. I ordered the Butternut Squash Ravioli.
Was so looking forward to it, sounded yummy. Much to my dismay, there were SEVEN raviolis. That's all. Yes, they were tasty, but SEVEN???? I asked the person behind the counter, if this was the ones listed on the board. She said no, and showed me a menu. I found them. I was shocked. $17.00, for SEVEN raviolis.
Yes, $17.00 for SEVEN raviolis=$2.42 each. No soup. No salad. Went somewhere else to get more food.
Never is soon enough to go back"}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow, waiters rushed and not very friendly.  However, the food was good.  Tomato bruchetta and risotto balls were great and the Bolonegse ragu was amazing. Only gave them 3 stars mainly because of service, you have to pay extra if you want garlic bread and the chicken livers pate was not very good.  Decent pricing and hood sized portions, big enough to share. Would possibly come back if in the area again."}
{"text":"We had heard about this delightful little place on DD&D and were in Scottsdale for less than 2 days and had to try it out.  It was everything and then some.  Super nice staff, great ambiance and the food was amazing.  I started with the Aperol Spritz, so refreshing, so different, it's a must.  We ordered the calamari and rice balls for appetizers.  Calamari with that broth was just delicious.  The rice balls were light and flavorful.  I had the Lemoncello pasta and my husband ordered the bolognese pasta.  Out of this world.  The pasta was fresh homemade, the sauces were perfect.  Tiramisu and Cannoli ended the meal, just as amazing as the appetizers and entrees.  I so wish my hometown had an independent Italian restaurant like this, more towns across the country need a Giuseppe's."}
{"text":"I was searching for a good Italian spot and the Phoenix new times recommended this places as one of the best in town. Whoever gave this restaurant less than 4 stars either has no taste buds or just ordered the wrong thing. It was excellent. 

Rice balls for an app, tortellini with meat sauce for me and the bolognese ragu for my date. Great meat sauce. Great service. I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Loved the prosciutto and melon, the 4 cheese ravioli (for my 9 year old) and the penne la salmone for myself. I love the atmosphere and the staff is so friendly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"After a bad experience with a friend several months ago (mostly our server,) I decided to try again a couple more times with a New Times deal. The food isn't bad, although a bit overpriced (a friend told me they raised their prices after being featured on DDD several years ago). The eggplant parmesan was good. The first time I went back, my server asked me after placing my salad and entree order if I would like some garlic bread. I said sure, thinking it would be complimentary as it often is at Italian places, and she said it casually enough to make it seem so. I do not recall seeing it on the menu. I got my bill and it was $4. I later noticed it was on the menu board which seems to be geared for their takeout customers. The second time I declined when she offered garlic bread again, and I even declined the basic bread and butter she offered me later because I wasn't sure how much it would cost! In my opinion, that would be like a Mexican restaurant offering you chips and salsa and then charging you for it. If I want to pay for it, I will order it. Given the offerings in the area with bar seating and similar, if not lower prices, I will probably not return any time soon."}
{"text":"Tucked in a small hole in a strip mall, this little place actually serves really good food! It was on DDD for a reason!  Small but with charm and a really pleasant women behind the counter for lunch, we ordered and shared a meatball sub and italian sausage with sweet peppers sub. We also started with the prosciutto and melon. The appetizer was amazing, just like I got in Italy. The sandwiches were both fantastic, I am still trying to decide which was my favorite. They had plenty of cheese and sauce and were falling apart and messy and yummy just the way a saucy italian sandwich should be!

They have ice tea and a variety of soda's and italian sodas but they are in a can fyi. Tables are a little close but the food was worth at as well as the service. We did have a local dines voucher for half off the meal but the prices were really great. We really felt like we got out money's worth and would go back in a second without the coupon.  I will be back to try many more things on their menu!"}
{"text":"Took me two years to get there, but loved the food, casual atmosphere. My wife does not like red sauces so she had the pasta with lemon cello (sp) with ham, very good. I loved the fresh pasta, ragu sauce of my dish. Excellent!"}
{"text":"I'm a big Triple D fan, which is why I took a chance on this 3.5 star Yelp rated \"diner\" and gave it a try. 

Yes, it's true - the atmosphere (strip mall) vs. the servings (small, yet satisfying) vs. the price (on the high side) aren't consistent. For what we paid, I'd expect  fine dining ambiance, and bread and salad to be included with the meals. With that being said, the food was fresh and absolutely delicious -- a welcome relief from all of the \"franchise\" food we've experienced since moving here about a month ago. We LOVE good quality  mom and pop restaurants, and this hits the mark completely, which makes it well worth the money. The waitress was very cordial, the food was served timely, and  the owner of the restaurant was spirited and friendly in making his way around to his guests. My rating is 5 stars because I feel Giuseppe's food, all by itself, deserves more than a overall 3.5 rating."}
{"text":"This little gem is located in the same strip mall that houses a Sprouts Farmers Market, an accountant, a big chain pizza shop, a barber and a Starbucks and it is a beacon of light for Phoenix. This mom and pop Italian far cuisine is absolutely to die for and it will not cost you an arm and a leg to treat yourself to one of the best experiences in The Valley of the Sun. 

The staff is attentive and welcoming (which is needed after a long day of business travel from out of town), the atmosphere was relaxing, the way we romanticize eating Italian food in a neighborhood piazza. It is a small and intimate setting. I dined alone but several parties of friends and families were tucked into tables in the dining room very comfortably. 

I think next time I come, I will bring a special someone and recommend the black ink pasta. This dish looks absolutely beautiful, and with the seafood variety that came with the pasta, I thought I was eating just a few miles from the sea. The wines were a perfect pairing to the food which I will be dreaming about until my next return."}
{"text":"Inedible is the best way to describe Giuseppe's on 28th. I decided to order the Italian Mac and Cheese, which is described as \"served three different cheeses with noodles and prosciutto\" on GrubHub. What I got was an over baked rectangle of penne pasta with cheese burnt on top and NO prosciutto at all. It was disappointing. I would recommend going somewhere else."}

Ordered the black squid ink pasta with shrimp and calamari.
If I could have had it over vanilla ice cream for desert I would have done that.

Would certainly go back.

A bit crowded but the food saved the day."}
{"text":"Well I went back & my experience eating there was a solid 2 stars.

I got an antipasto salad. It was average to below average. It didn't hold a candle to the antipasto salad from Spinato's. Try both & tell me I'm wrong.

I also ordered 3 meatballs. These poor meatballs were the tiniest meatballs I have ever been served in a restaurant. I felt cheated for the price of those little balls. Try the meatballs at Lisa G's instead. They are huge & delicious & you'll have leftovers for the next day.

I am all for supporting local businesses, but I need to feel like I am getting a great product for a reasonable price. Sorry Giuseppe's, but I did not feel I got those things at your place."}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying I LOVE food, great service, I like to share the enormous portions served in restaurants, drink water with lemon and I do not drink alcoholic beverages.  I know, I scream cheapskate, but I think I deserve a decent 2.5 star experience, at least for the food.  Most places meet or exceed my expectations.  Guiseppes did not. 

And there comes a time when my youthful, ethnic appearance, water with lemon, request to share, and sober living is met with that \"I am not going to make money off of you\" vibe from the owner.  It hasn't happened in a very long time, but Guiseppes proved their still is bad service reserved for their unwanted patrons.

I was very excited to eat here seeing it on Diners Driveins and Dives on Food Network, my favorite food network show, and seeing all of the New Times best of awards.  Got there at 8:30pm Friday night, there were people waiting outside, thought it was a good sign.  Now I thought being in a strip mall, next to the water N ice store, the service would be warm and welcoming and the place would be chock full of non-dbags.  I am always cool waiting a bit for good food but being stared down by rich, overweight women with their husbands in flip flops, cargo shorts and Affliction tees and teenage platinum blondes with their smug smiling boyfriends in their flip flops, plaid shorts, and Affliction tees is never my cup of tea.

Fast forward 30 minutes of this ish we get seated, another 10 minutes menus, another 10 minutes a water and a watered down gross iced tea which they CHARGED us for even though she took it back and gave him water, and by 9:30pm we get our 15dollar saltysaltysalty bolognese ragu with overcooked spaghetti (we didn't get the homemade pasta) to share, 4dollar baby 1/2 inch thin toastettes, and 2dollar marinara bowl for dipping.   (FYI this is an Italian Restaurant that not only makes you pay for an ounce of bread, they also CHARGE for extra virgin olive oil)

So go to Guiseppes if you like:

_\"EH\" Italian Food
_Cold and dry humor from the owner
_Slow waitresses
_Being stared at by stuffy people in such an unlikely, un-stuffy atmosphere
_Your hopes let down =) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here often. I love how it's small, not pretentious at all. It's so hard to find good Italian in AZ. Especially when your boyfriend is a hard core East Coast Italian! This is the only place his picky Italian family will eat at when in town. Staff is great and we always feel welcomed. The veal meatballs and wild boar cavatelli are on point...must tries!"}
{"text":"Was very excited to go here. Heard great things. The flashing signage is a bit much. The service lacks fun and the ability to handle a full house. Felt rushed. The portions aren't exactly what you'd expect for the fares. Apparently the entrees don't even include a side of bread or a salad, but who knows. Maybe we were supposed to get the bread, but they were just too busy? Bruchetta toppings were weak. All in all the food is pretty good, but they have quite a few things to work on here. Took notice to a few other things, but no need to mention them. Coin toss if I'd return any time soon. Ciao!"}
{"text":"Was looking for to trying this place. Went there in August, owner was out of town apparently playing the cello or something like that in Michigan we were told, and maybe this has something to do with the overall lackluster experience. Food was rushed, and very mediocre. Bruschetta was dry. Pasta relatively bland. Our server was nice enough, but seem to be in a hurry. Dining Room is uncomfortably small."}
{"text":"After 1 hour of watching tables of 4 being seated before 2 tops, we finally got seated. When I expressed my disappointment in how things had been handled ( My wife and I were really excited to try this place), \"The Boss\" was nasty and offered us the door. We decided to stay to see if the food was as good promoted and besides, it was getting late. The rice balls were flat, soggy and would get you beat up in the Bronx. The 6 meat Ragu was undersalted and boring... saved only by the pasta which was nice. The Gaspacho was nicely done and definitely the high light of our experience.

Not worth the effort.  More TV Hype than cooking......"}
{"text":"We have heard about this place for a long time, and just never came.  We were hungry and right around the corner so we finally decided to stop in a give it a try.  The place is small, and the decor isn't something to be excited about.  We tried the osso bucco and black squid ink pasta with shrimp and broccolini.  The osso bucco came out cold, which is not good.  But we told the waitress and she quickly got that taken care of.  It was good, extremely meaty, but not really worth the cost or wait in my opinion.  

The black squid ink pasta was very good.  It wasn't salty enough, but after we added a little on our own, it was perfect.  The saving grace that took this place from a 2 star to a 3 for me was the tiramisu.  It's the classic no frills tiramisu that I so dearly miss these days when all the restaurants try to make fancy-over-the-top ones.  It was creamy, light, and just perfect.

I'd go back for the tiramisu."}
{"text":"I have had Osso Bucco numerous times both in Italy and in the states. This is definitely top three I've ever eaten. Pasta was perfectly cooked. Cannoli was impeccable and obviously fresh. Service was excellent. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I didn't get it. Giuseppes is a 2 star establishment serving 3 star food and charging 4 star prices. 

The inside is pretty plain, lunch style seating. Black and white, casual, chairs and tables. 

The food had a nice flavor but wasn't very filling. I went in for lunch and paid over 10 dollars with a tip and wasn't even full. I didn't even order a drink. To me the setting is for lunch. I don't think Id want to go and sit down for dinner as its not really a sit down style restaurant. If you are set up for a casual lunch you should have a lunch menu or if you are wanting to be a real restaurant and serve dinner I think you should have real tables, chairs, maybe a booth or two and set it up that way. 

I guess I wouldn't want to go back for lunch or for dinner. I must have missed it. 

Food - 3.5, Service 3, Ambiance 2.5, Value 2"}

{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING Italian food in the heart of Phoenix. The service and staff is amazing, very enjoyable and hospitable. My whole family and I really enjoyed everything from start to finish about this place. 

We ordered the antipasto, burrata, salads, and entrees and desserts. We will DEF be back and I highly highly recommended them to everyone living (and visiting) in the area!

Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Great home made Italian pastas. Love the spaghetti with clams and also the four cheese pasta dish. Small selection of beers and wine. Intimidate small bistro. Can get crowded. Good service and the owner checks on you and cares about your experience. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious delicious, servers were awesome , tight squeeze restaurant but that doesn't bother me . I had the spaghetti with house made pasta and meatballs , for dessert  I had there flourless cake . Was looking for an authentic Italian I think I found it !"}
{"text":"Anyone that give this restaurant less than 5 stars has no idea what they are talking about.  It is a restaurant that is for foodies.  It is NOT fancy, because that is not the point! Everything is made to ORDER and is fresh!  

I have been here several times and think it is a fantastic spot.  Get to know the owner Richard. He is awesome. Tell him you like wine and he will pull something out that will surprise you.  Tell him you like good grappa and he will shock you!  

If you think the restaurant is crowded go home! This is a true little hole in the wall! 

If you think the food is expensive, try and make home made Italian food on your own... Not happening cheaply! Oh, add a bottle of wine and guess what it gets even harder!  What is surprising is that Giuseppe's does NOT hit you for expensive wine.  Everything is reasonable. 

This is a restaurant for people that love good food!

EAT, DRINK, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a very homey, family owned restaurant.  I seen this on a rerun on food network, found it on yelp & decided to stop in for lunch. It's a very small restaurant with just a handful of tables. So expect to be in close quarters with other dining guests. The menu isn't very large but they have quite an extensive list of some Italian staples. I started my meal with prosciutto & melon. The melon was fresh and super sweet the prosciutto was tough almost as if it had been refrigerated for a long time. I also ordered a side of Sicilian olives, that weren't seasoned. The black Olives seemed old, only the green ones were fresh... The Server brought us bread and butter and then butter came in these little plastic cups with foil lids, like the kind you get at hotels... for an Italian joint I expected much better bread and butter.. i had a bowl of pasta fagioli soup that was okay... it needed more beans and pasta, there was more broth than veggies & pasta... and a glass of wine that was amazing... I was a tad disappointed in this joint... I think I'm their \" hay day \" things were probably much better than now but you can definitely tell this joint is just trying to stay afloat. They had a decent lunch crowd and the service was really good... I want to like this place so I'll try it again for dinner instead of lunch and what it's like. I'm giving one start for efforts and another for service..."}
{"text":"Love this place. Every time I want a good pasta dish this is we're I go. Fresh pasta great prices and good customer service. If you have the taste for Italian food look no further!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here three or four times, mostly because a friend at work really likes the suppli (risotto balls).  Their food is okay.  I have a simple test for any restaurant to classify as being at least 'good' it must make me close my eyes.  Never happened here with any dish I've tasted, suppli included.  And they serve Pepsi products....echhhhh....the ultimate sign of a cheap-ass restaurant owner...
The service is friendly though and it's always good to get out with Melissa!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre, unsatisfying and barely average!

I joined a friend recently on a Friday night and the entire meal was barely passable. The calamari was uninspired and bland, just sauteed with a thin red sauce and a few frozen peas. Hardly inspiring. The 4 bruschetta were good, with interesting touches like honey and chicken liver, but another tasted like it had plain old strawberry jam on top of mascarpone cheese? 
The fettucini carbonara was exceptionally bland and lacked the classic ingredients in abundance like it should including peas. Did they end up in the calamari by mistake ?  

The house recommended fresh tagliatelle with bolognese sauce was sad and uninspired and poorly prepared and presented. Really, as a Chef, I found the dish lacking any depth, including the unseasoned meat sauce (6 different meats in the sauce according to the owner, but still lacking any depth, flavor or significant interest). The sauce was mixed into the noodles already and looked very amateurish and very cafeteria-like. A real disappointment overall.   

The prices are actually a bit expensive for a strip mall and poor quality. Plastic cups for water, paper napkins for dinner service and piccolo pours of a limited wine selection only added to the lack of value. 

Will definitely not return. A disappointing experience that needs attention and correction."}
{"text":"I don't get the rave review!  If you like to eat what I call \"peasant\" Italian, this is the place for you.  Greasy, loads of tomato sauce {that tastes like a can of tomatoes that was heated up) nondescript entrees and you have an unsophisticated palate, by all means, this is the place for you!  Service is mediocre, you are cramped into small quarters, and did I mention that almost everything tastes the same, except the boring salad.  Get brave and go elsewhere.  You won't regret it!  Price point was o.k. but the food wasn't.  Sorry!"}

{"text":"We had a wonderful time at Giuseppe's'! It's a very intimate, authentic, Italian joint that's packed. We loved it. There was no wait, but you could tell it's a spot where they have loyal followers. Our waiter Romero was incredible. He made our first time special! He recommended many, many, dishes and we really appreciated his time and expertise. We loved everything especially the carbonara and the cavatelli. Giuseppe came by too, making us feel very special! Great food, great service, great venue, and great drinks! 

Thank you"}
{"text":"I've had better food at Olive Garden and I typically do not eat at chain restaurants. The watermelon salad I ordered, which, by my mistake of thinking it was a salad with greens, was cubed watermelon, 4 olives and a hint of shredded mint. (I couldn't find the feta which was supposed to be on it) I asked for chicken to be added. It came with a few very thin limp cold pieces of shredded chicken. The pasta dish my boyfriend ordered was over cooked and salty. The soup he ordered had very little flavor too. 
We asked about the Yelp check-in complimentary glass of wine with an entree and said we both had one. He said no problem and then told us what wine he was going to bring us as though there wasn't a choice. When the check came there was an $8.50 charge for one of the glasses. I got a little attitude going, stating had I known that I would not have accepted the wine he brought. He did take the charge off the bill, which was appreciated. 
The service was decent but the atmosphere was minimal. It reminded me of a simple pizza joint, however, the prices were not reflective of that. Overpriced in my opinion. 
Would I return? No."}
{"text":"I reallyed wanted this place to give me a yelp 5 star experience. It wasthe final of my two-day fat load for this new diet i'm on and so I though \"Italian\" The place was crowded, usually a good sign, but the ambiance- what ambiance? The presentation of the food was worse than what I do in my own home. We \"upgraded\" for $1 on each of our plates for homemade pasta (you would hope it would always be homemade). I had the ragu, it was ok- a little odd tasting. My fiance had the alfredo, which was kinda watery. Plus the garlic bread was $1/piece and was very hard to chew. All in all, not good or bad- but WAY overpriced! Over $10 per plate plus the bread and we didn't have more than one drink b/c the service was SLOW. Maybe its better at lunch?
hmmmmm"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, excellent food and excellent service both times. Had the Bruschetta for an appetizer, main courses were Scampi and the Shrimp and Lobster Risotto. Dessert was Tiramisu and Crème Brûlée. Our were servers friendly and attentive. The menu varies and is a somewhat eclectic mix of typical and more unique Italian fare without being overwhelming. There is almost certainly something for everyone. This is one of a small handful of my Italian favorites in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!  Would have given 5 stars but soda was from the can served in a plastic cup."}
{"text":"Was this restaurant featured on a show from the Food Network??? I never would have guessed based on the big sign outside, the framed poster from \"Guys Big Bite\" on one wall, the caricature of Guy spray painted directly on the wall, the autographed photo of Guy on the other wall, or certain dishes on the menu labeled as being featured on the food network.  OK, OK... we get it- you were on TV. 

Normally, I would have given this place 4 stars; I used to work down the street and my coworkers and I had take out from here countless times. I have only had the capellini with meat sauce, and the marinara sauce is worth raving over. Today was my first time dining in the restaurant, and will now probably be the last I eat anything from there. I should have stuck with take out only!

Dinner was just my husband and me, our bill was $42 (before the tip), and truly was ridiculous for what we had. Paper table cloths on the tables, water served in plastic cups, I ordered a soda, which was brought to me in the can.  We both had small dinner salads, I basically had spaghetti, my husband had some alfredo type dish that was just noodles and bland sauce. We ordered bread, which was an extra $3 charge, but was never brought to us (but also not charged on our bill). I should note as an aside that every time we picked up lunch bread was included with no charge. The waiter tried to upsale everything- I wanted a soda, my husband stuck with water- the waiter pointed out the wine list 3 times. I wanted capellini and sauce, he suggested the Bolognese instead, I declined. I can't imagine what the bill would have been for a diner atmosphere in a strip mall, bad service, and semi-decent food if we had taken any of the waiter's suggestions. We don't mind paying for good food, but the prices do not match the décor, or the service, of the place.

Many other places in the Phoenix area have been featured on Food Network show's as well, not just this one. I'm thinking if you want to try out any of them, skip over this one."}
{"text":"I usually love hole in the wall places.  The service usually ends up being great but the service here was a little slow and seemed in disarray.  I ordered the garlic bread which was your average bread and yummy.  The bolognese was great, but it's also hard to mess up bolognese in my opinion.  There wasn't anything super spectacular about it, so at the end of the day, very average."}
{"text":"Very high quality Italian food in a small, strip mall restaurant setting.   Handmade, fresh pasta: tagliatelle with bite and chewy cavatelli.  Bolognese ragu was excellent, wonderfully meaty and rich and without too much sauce or oil.   Delicious butternut ravioli and bruschetta.  (5/5 in quality for food)

Wild boar ragu was slightly too oily and salty for my taste.
Setting is a bit cramped for the high caliber of the food.

The owner is a symphony musician who studied cooking in Italy for 9 years, and his dedication to his craft shines through in his food (musicians are the biggest foodies:))."}
{"text":"I made it to Guiseppe's only after a friend had seen it on the Food Network.  I'd heard of it before, but hadn't ever felt like making the trek out here from Glendale.  On one hand, I'm glad I did.  I've been lucky finding good Italian food places as of late.  It's also nice to know what people are fussing over with places like this, that get noticed after being on tv.  On the other hand, the overall experience I just found lacking.


Yes, I know it was on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  Even though I suspect it falls into the first category, I still think it could have been better.

There was a wait.  Which only shocked me since it was an off night, so be aware of that.  Reading many of the previous reviews, I had caught that it was BYOB.  So we had run over to the Sprouts next door and grabbed a few bottles.  Surprise!  No more BYOB.  Oh well, wine never really goes to waste.

The place was cramped, and my party of 5 was squashed into a tiny corner table.  Then, what made that even more exciting, was the roving guitar player that started as we sat down.  As far as ambiance goes, he and his female vocal accompaniment left a bit to be desired.

The food was good.  If I were to rate solely on that, it's deserving of 3 stars easily.  The eggplant appetizer was thin sliced and breaded, though I would have liked more of the red sauce on it to combat the dryness of the breading.  I can't comment too well on the bruschetta appetizer, as splitting 4 different types 5 ways doesn't allow for a sizable tasting.  The bolognese I had was very tasty, and the inclusion of ox tail to it was a very very good one.

But in the end, the pretty good food couldn't save me from an overall \"meh\" dining experience."}
{"text":"Arrived just b4 lunch closing... We had bolognese, carbonara, and Mac n cheese, All were fresh and delicious a must visit when in phx. Service attentive and prompt love it"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place by chance.  Nice, quaint atmosphere, locally owned..Home made pasta and dessert. We had 6 people in our party. Started with the calamari which was sautéed and served in a nice tomato broth, garlic bread, burrata and the eggplant appetizer.  All of which were delicious! For dinner I had the cavitappi with sausage and broccoli rabe, my husband had the bolognese, 2 people in our party had the lobster risotto and 1 had the osso busco. Everyone raved about their meal. For dessert we had home made cannoli and key lime pie, both were delish. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Have been going here for years.  Never disappointed; now that have a liquor license now; very good selections (if I drank alcohol any longer)...The food has always been stellar (especially homemade pastas), and service has been great; now, the \"outdoor\" seating has been added; to make it more appealing; I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bland, plain, flavorless Pasta dishes.
$3 stale bread (I just asked for 1 piece to keep my 2 year old busy until the food arrived- he said I will bring you a basket- never bothering to tell me it was not complimentary like most places).
Bruchetta- stale bread plus toppings- i really would have liked the fig/goat one if it would have been on different bread.
Husband had Osso Buca was very tender but again flavorless.
Disappointed.  Won't be a repeat client."}

{"text":"Arrived at Giuseppe's for dinner around 7 pm on a weekend night. Seated outside as we did not have a reservation. Everyone was rude from the beginning. Waited 15 minutes for waiter to come back to table and he never did. Due to terrible service we left before having a chance to order anything, went down the street, and experienced very good service at another establishment. Very disappointing, will not go back."}
{"text":"While visiting my Mom to list her place for sale in Phoenix, our prospective realtor recommended Guiseppe's on 28th. When we walked in, we found it to be charming. They were just opening for dinner service at the time, so we were the only table in the restaurant. The space overall is small, and can seem crowded, with tables being very close together, practically touching, so the fact we were the only party was a good thing. 

When you walk in you will see a lunch counter type situation in the front of the restaurant. We were thinking you order at the counter, then pick up your food from there. That is not the case, after inquiring about the set up, we were pleasantly informed they will come to your table to take your order.

The service was pretty good, however the food was not the greatest. My Mom ordered spaghetti and meatballs, while I ordered the lasagna. Both were priced accordingly, however they both were lacking flavor, and they tasted as if they were previously frozen, not fresh. 

Overall, this was just ok, certainly not great. This restaurant was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, I personally do not see any of the hype. An average Italian spot, not the best."}

{"text":"We had family in town from the East coast with a little one in tow. I called the day before to make a reservation for 12. I confirmed they take reservations and that they would be able to seat 12 on a Friday night. They said that wouldn't be a problem, and asked if we would be comfortable with the patio. I said that was fine. The day of they called 3 times to confirm our reservation, make sure it was still on and to confirm we were still comfortable with the patio. Each time I confirmed the reservation and that we were happy with the patio. Then we get there that night and they say the wait is \"45 minutes\" I said we had a reservation and they said the wait is still \"45 minutes\". I asked to speak with the manager and they took me to the owner, I said \"Hi, I'm here for my 6:30pm reservation.\" He very rudely said as I told your family it's a 45 minute wait. I then asked why he took my reservation if he couldn't accommodate us? He again rudely said \"It's busy on a Friday night and a bunch of people showed up, what do you want me to do?\" He kept trying to argue with me, was EXTREMELY rude and never once apologized. We couldn't wait the 45 minutes, 6:30pm was already a very late reservation for a little one from the East Coast, so we couldn't push it another 45 minutes, which is why we had a reservation! I know now how small the restaurant is, he should have just told me from the beginning they couldn't accommodate us. Most people won't be going here with big parties, but I would still not support this restaurant because of their horrible service, and really really mean owner!"}

home made pasta.

only jazz and opera on the play list.

so whats not to love about this story?  he grows up in the bronx.  loves his mama's italian cookin.  becomes a professional celloist. travels all over the planet playing the classics.  starts up this italian food gig as a hobby and it takes off like nathans hotdogs.

great staff makes you feel like you are on arthur ave.  some nyc favorites on the menu, and unusual surprises like sepia pasta.  the food is decent and sure is good enough for me.  dont ramble on about a more authentic italian place in pheonix unless they cure their own capocolla in the cellar.  thank you.  end of story.  see ya."}

AWESOME FOOD
Great wine selection
Did I mention the baked ziti is amazing?
Chicken Parm my friend had looked pretty delish as well...
Spectacular restaurant, can't wait to dine there again!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Seeing the \"As seen on...\" as I walked by this place, I laughed and immediately had to try it as a novelty. As I walked in to order to-go there was an elder couple sitting outside enjoying their pasta. 

The waiter was extremely nice and gave me a brief overview of the menu after he was informed it was my first time. He made a few suggestions and left me to decide on a dish. While I was searching, the couple outside started to tell me that the beet pasta was their all time favorite dish. I saw the lady eating it - it was gorgeous! She said it can't be beet. 

I ended up with a classic to gage their level of deliciousness: the Alfredo. It's cooked to order with fresh noodles and sauce. That being said, it took a little extra to cook so the waiter offered me a glass of wine with his apologies. I politely declined as I had to drive a half hour home. 

When I got home to eat this in bed (just being honest), it was as if I was transported back to my grandma's chicken noodle soup. The noodles were out of this world. The Alfredo sauce was a bit watery from getting takeout so I'd highly recommend ordering and eating there as opposed to take-out. Nevertheless, it was one of the best Italian dishes I've had in the valley. You have to go into it with the mindset of hearty Midwestern meets Italian and you'll be satisfied. 

The meals are large enough to be split family style or shared on a date. Next time I'll certainly sit down for a glass of wine and enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"Atrocious service.  Was greeted with a very gruff \"just sit down there, I'll take care of you in a minute.\"  Then a party of five came in, were seated, given menus, water and had drink orders taken before we received ANYTHING even though they came in after us.  I will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Amazing. This place hit the nail on the head and it's no surprise the owner knows good Italian food as he's from NY! Rich the owner was welcoming and attentive as was our waiter, Jose. The food was incredible - bruschetta combo, ravioli quartet, tortellini, and a tiramisu for dessert literally the best I have ever had. Perfectly flavored, the type of food that you just need one more bite even though you were full 2 courses ago. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It took me several tries to be able to a table at this restaurant but I've now been here twice recently and have enjoyed every bite.  The butternut squash ravioli is amazing.  If you're up to try something a little different the spaghetti Neri is great.  It was my first time trying squid ink pasta and it was so delicious I will eat it again.  The cannoli is authentic tasting and not overly sweet.  I'd like to see them expand the beer selection but other than that this little restaurant is great and obviously others agree since it took me several tries to get in."}
{"text":"Well wanted to try some new Italian place today, so went to Giuseppe's on 28th we live a long way from here and was hoping it was good!!! Guess I was expecting to much, it was okay not great!!! Pasta is so thick, never had it like that and would have preferred it thinner! Server was very nice, polite and helpful! Too far to go a second time and try something else, so probably won't be returning!!! Where or where can you find a great Italian restaurant, have tried so many, the chain ones are better than any one of a kind and I'm tired of those????"}
{"text":"Everything was great! The apps were okay we got the bruschetta and pasta fagioli I was raised Italian some I'm pretty critical om those two things.. We ordered gnocchi with the pink cream sauce , shrimp ravioli with garlic butter sauce with red pepper flakes let me say when you cut into the ravioli the oil blends so good and the ricotta just melts out.. Last the eggplant app which was like a round eggplant pizza with no bread it was eggplant done right !! Sliced thin and fried perfect you need to eat here !!! New Jersey New York style right in Phoenix !"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for years.  It has maintained it's quality even when it has changed owners.  There is a funky lady there that has worked there for a long time-17 Years? She always remembers you and makes your experience more fun.  Always good food, Always good service. It is a fun little place to go but won't impress someone who is more interested in \"atmosphere\" than in good food and company. This city could use more small restaurants like this that just don't follow the norm.

Speaking of following the norm.  You do need to check when they are open.  Their hours are a little different. It is well worth making a trip to this little place when they are open.  

(I usually go there when I am planning on going to the Sprouts in the same center.  I can walk off a few calories after I'm done with dinner!)"}
{"text":"I live in walking distance to this place and wished it was all that and a bag of chips. Really people FIVE STARS???? seriously concerned  for where those people normally eat. This place is not even average. We have tried it 2X and just wont do it again. To be honest i cant remember what we had both times but a pasta dish was one thing and a meatball sub?? not sure. Pass on this one and go up the street to La Fontanella for a much better meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate dinner here a few weeks ago after living nearby for some time.  The service is wonderful here, and the food is very good.  The space is a little cramped, which is really my only complaint.  Arrive earlier than normal dinner time if you don't want to wait for a table"}
{"text":"Went there for Dinner last night 4 of us .thought we would give it a try after seeing it on tv. Small place , service was good and seemed clean. The food was subpar. Not one of us liked the food. All tried something different. No one liked what they had. Too bad , was hoping to like it.maybe you'll have better luck. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal! The bruschetta was some of the best we have had. I got the carbonara and my husband got the lasagna. Both were incredible. The carbonara was made with homemade pasta and it was outstanding. Get there early because the restaurant is small and fills up fast. Service was excellent! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had a very nice time last Saturday night at Giuseppe's on 28th. 

This is a very, very small restaurant, that seats only twenty or so patrons.  We arrived early and waited for about forty five minutes or so for our seats in the rear, near the kitchen.  This was actually a good place, since we had no one sitting next to us and all the other seats were on top of each other, elbow to elbow. 

Giuseppe's may seem like a one man show because the owner Rich is woking both ends of the house, but we believe there were three others working in the kitchen.  

We started with Antipasto for $10.95, and then ordered our normal baseline meal of Chicken Breast Parmigiana for $14.95 and the Pasta Bolognese Ragu with a side of Meatballs and Sausage for $16.95, plus the $4.00 up charge.  We also had two soft drinks, which seemed expensive at $3.00 each. 

The food was very good for what they call: \"Phoenix's Favorite Local Italian Kitchen!\"  I know they've taken some heat for being on the Food Network and Guy Fieri's show \"Diners, Drive-In and Dives\".  But this is nothing more then a good local Italian place.  It's not gourmet, but neither are the restaurants on the show Three Star Michelin either.   Our meal ran $61.92 including taxes, but before Tip.

We enjoyed ourselves and will be back.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. These folks have been in Scottsdale for years and this is the first time I have visited Guiseppe's. What a pleasure. Food was terrific. The 4 of us had different dishes. I ordered the \"Alex\" pasta dish, slightly spicy, perfect creamy tomato sauce, totally YUM! the meatballs were AWESOME! Can't wait to try a Meat Ball Sandwich!

You can bring in your own alcohol if you drink wine or beer, There is no corking fee. Pretty cool stuff. the is no bar, just food.

Downside, if you get there early and sit inside, you can speak and hear each other. If you get there when it starts to fill up you can barely hear yourself think. So Sad.

All in all, worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This place seems to want to get rich off being featured on Food Network.  There's a big banner out front now and there are pictures all over the place of the owner (i'm guessing) and Guy.  Anyway, this is why I decided to try the place at all so maybe it worked.

My friend ordered the chicken parmigiana sandwich and I went with the Linguine with Red Clam sauce.  Its a very tiny place with plastic patio chairs.  We waited for about 20 min so we had time to check out the decor.  

The prices are crazy!  They charge as much as a full Italian restaurant does - I've never seen a diner, drive thru or a dive that charges so much per plate!  Skimming the menu, I'd say the average entree is about 12, appetizer is 8, desert is 5.  

So by the time we got our food we were starving, but we managed to drive home which was about 5 min away.  They gave me a few pieces of bread for my pasta which was very good (and very surprising because bread is on the menu for like $5).  The pasta was overcooked and the sauce was WAAAY salty.  The portion wasn't what I expected for the price I paid at a \"dive\".  The sandwich was a little better, but nothing special.  I work at a hospital and I'd say their chicken parmigian is better.

All in all, this wasn't the best experience.  I say if they want to charge so much, open an actual restaurant.  Then maybe they can serve some liquor instead of just having pictures of wine bottles everywhere and empty vodka bottles holding flowers.  (Its BYOB, $5 corkage fee).  I'm very disappointed in Food Network.  :\"}
{"text":"Was in town for a softball tournament on the weekend of April 14th-15th and went to Giuseppe's on 28th for our team dinner on Saturday night.  Since we weren't sure when we would be able to arrive at the restaurant due to playing and we needed a table for 20, the owner, Richard, was nice enough to offer up his restaurant and his staff after hours at 9pm for us. How awesome is that!

Richard and his staff were amazingly friendly and helpful, especially considering they were staying after hours to serve a rowdy bunch of softball players.  

Between all the people in our party,  we tried a huge variety of the menu.  The food was all delicious and came flying out of the kitchen.  A few stands outs being the Veal Osso Buco and Squid Ink Pasta w/Shrimp and Calamari.  Oh and the Gorgonzola and Honey Bruschetta and the Tiramisu are MUST TRIES!

A HUGE THANK YOU to Richard and his staff for a fabulous dinner. The whole team was grateful for all you did for us and very satisfied with the dinning experience you provided."}
{"text":"3.5 stars - pasta was a full 5 stars but the chicken parm fell a little short, edges were tough/over cooked.  Portion size was also slightly on the small size at $16 but adequate for dinner.  Staff was very friendly and courteous.  I would definitely visit again  ."}
{"text":"My second time here, went with my girlfriend last night and the food was amazing! Had the wild boar ragu and a veal meatball... Best Italian food in Phoenix by far! The service was a tad slow, but we just got there after their dinner rush. I highly recommend for anyone who wants a taste of true Italian cuisine with a unique twist!"}
{"text":"I've been to Giuseppe's several times.  Food is quite good.  Service is ok. Prices are too high.  Each time I've been to G.'s they have run out of something.  Once it was pasta.  Another time it was another key ingredient.  They say oh, this will be as good but it isn't.  They try to talk you up to their home made pasta but it's only one kind of pasta.  So spaghetti carbonara with the upgrade isn't spaghetti carbonara at all it's fettuchini carbonara.
They do make an excellent Tiramissu.  However, the cost is as much as a whole meal at other restaurants.
It's a good, overpriced restaurant but I would rather go to another restaurant which is equally as good such as Christo's.
NEVER arrange to meet friends at Giuseppe's for supper .  They don't take reservations and your party can easily cool your heels for very long times.
Would I go if you were paying the bill?  YES
Would I go on my own?  NO"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times before the Diner, Drive-ins and Dives over the yeart. The only item I have had and really enjoyed was the meat ball sandwich. I was there recently and had the meatball sandwich which I had such fond memories of enjoying and it was okay. So, if I am in the area, I will give it another try.

And one more thing, the Guiseppe's on Scottsdale Rd did have better meat ball sandwiches."}
{"text":"Our experience last night at Giuseppe's was  a 10 out of 10!  Since we live in the neighborhood, we figured we would stop by after seeing the sign \"featured on the food network\". We got there at 7:30 on a Friday night and it was busy. For three people we ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs, Lasagna and Signature Bolognese and started with the calamari. Not traditional calamari because it was not breaded and deep fried! Healthier and delicious... the sauce was amazing. Jose Antonio was our server and he really took care of us!  I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes Italian."}
{"text":"Went here a few nights ago with a party of 4.  We just missed the dinner rush and had the place all to ourselves.  There are tons of reviews on here that pretty much cover everything, but here are some points to consider:

* Water is served in plastic cups
* Soda comes from the can so there are no refills ($3 for a can!)
* The bread is 'eh and costs you $3
* the bruschetta is just ok
* The fresh mozzarella is awesome
* The pasta is fresh and delicious
* The tiramisu is fresh, fluffy, creamy and delicious

The best part about this place is the owner, Richard Bock.  Although he jokes around and is super friendly, you can tell he knows what he is doing when it comes to his food and his restaurant.  From the prices he charges to the way he pushes the higher priced menu items, you can tell he is a sucker for the bottom line.

I admit I am one of those people who is all into going to places featured on TV, especially DDD so this place was on my list.  It didn't hurt either that there was a 50% off certificate on Local Dines ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ).

I'm not going to rush back because the place is pretty far from home, but if I am in the area and craving some almost homemade Italian, I will be sure to stop in again."}
{"text":"This place was a bit casual, but it is at a strip mall location.  The waitress was friendly and helpful with recommendations on our appetizers and entree.  I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and my love ordered the lasagna.  Seems like the place pulls in a regular."}
{"text":"Roses are red
Violets are blue
I used to love Giuseppe's
But the place has gone to poo.

I live in a community right across the street from Giuseppe's, and I've probably ordered takeout from them 20-30 times over the last five years. I really, really want to support this local business, but the quality of the food has gone downhill dramatically. I always order the same dishes (gnocchi w/cardinale, cavatelli w/beets and sausage and eggplant appetizer). Over the past year or so, every time I order my favorite food it tastes different. VERY inconsistent. Overcooked, undercooked, salty, bland ... these days, I never know what I'm going to get."}
{"text":"Cute place!  The house made lemoncello was amazing!  Osso bucco was very well prepared and the home made pasta was tender and perfect.  I have to say one of the best cannolis I've had!"}
{"text":"I really loved my last dining night at Giuseppe's. It's a small little restaurant in a strip mall but don't let that deter you , it's big on flavor and uniqueness in its pasta dishes. 

My boyfriend and I dined here with his company recently. We sampled the bruschettas, which are featured on a chalkboard, and the rice balls, which we shared because they are rich and ample. I had half of one and it was enough. 
For dinner, I ordered the Pasta al Limoncello, made with house made linguine noodles, prosciutto and a creamy sauce popped with a burst of Limoncello. I've just traveled to Italy and fell in love with the taste of Limoncello .. So I was interested to taste how this came together. Rich and amazing! I took half of my entree home. The Squid Ink Pasta with clams was ordered at our table, as well. Perfecto! So different! 

To me the portions were just enough for dinner and a little to take home. The bruschettas were ample servings as are the salads, which two could easily share. 

The Key Lime Pie is delicate and housemade, as well. I highly recommend! It's not a tart, tart taste like some key lime pies, it's just enough. 

The place filled up by 630pm. Including the patio. 
The only thing I would change is the bread. A good Italian restaurant needs good, hot Tuscan bread and oils and butter served. The rest...is mmmmmmmm :)"}
{"text":"This place a really great place to eat . The food is  amazing and people are a really friendly . Good Italian feel . Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for about 10 years and have never been disappointed. We are snow birds from Vancouver and have experienced hundreds of Italian restauarants. This is one of the best!!! The home made pasta and array of sauces are second to none. The atmosphere is very casual for high end cuisine which is a good thing. Rich and his staff are superb at making you feel comfortable and appreciated. The wine list, while not extensive is of good quality. On busy nights the wait isn't bad but I guarantee well worth it. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been coming here consistently for a year now. Always delicious. I love the scampi sauté with shrimp, arugula, and cherry tomatoes. My other favorite to go item is the eggplant parm sandwich."}
{"text":"Visited Giuseppe's while in Phoenix on a business trip. My bosses had heard about this restaurant from Diners Drive-In's and Dives. I was surprised that the restaurant was so small, but it was a comfy atmosphere. There were three of us and we shared the Chef's salad. It was VERY good! Definitely big enough to share and it was evenly proportioned with dressing. Could have eaten the whole thing by myself if I had a choice. I ordered the Pasta Alfredo-Limencello and it was alright, not the best. I ordered Tiramisu for dessert and it was AMAZING! Definitely worth ordering. Overall it was a very nice dinner and I would return if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Well after reading all these great reviews I have to admit that I can't top it. Except there should be a 6 star rating. The pasta fagoli soup was out of this world, salad excellent and the main course. Take your pick. I came back a second time while I am in town. I think I will come back a 3rd time in 4 days. This is a must stop for the best of the best !!"}
{"text":"This small welcoming place has BIG flavors. I completely understand what Guy Fierri picked this spot for his show. We had the burratta which was accompanied by a nice prosciutto, and risotto balls for appetizer. Both appetizers were deelish. Had the 7 meat bolognese ragu with fettuccini ... Very very tasty. All accompanied with a nice Barolo. This spot won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Came to this place because of triple ds. We got the Bolognese ragu pasta, Alfredo pasta with chicken, ravioli, and Gorgonzola with sage and walnuts. All were very good. Pasta were very thick, making the dishes heavy. Everyone was very nice and service was good. We were here for lunch. Only thing was this place is pretty pricey. 4 pasta dishes ran us around $60+ and two were only half orders.  Anyways, that was the only down side, I guess I'm still struggling in the price department.  But don't let that stop you from deciding for yourself."}
{"text":"Holy crapola... went here tonight with some friends and it was so friggin good.  Seriously, the best food I've had since moving to Phoenix 18 months ago.  I had the cheese tortellini with the tomato cream sauce.  Then we shared tiramisu for dessert with a coffee.  The wait was long, but who cares!  Once we were seated with were treated to a long and luxurious meal."}
{"text":"Just found this restaurant.  I am Italian, and this is about as close to homemade family style Italian food as you can get, unless your parents or grandparents came over on the boat.  Food was really good, portions were very large, service was good, and the staff was very friendly and attentive.  I was surprised that they don't accept credit cards, so remember to hit the ATM and bring cash.  The restaurant is small, and fills up quickly, but the tables turn fast."}
{"text":"First word I can think of when it comes to the food is WOAH! It was so good! We walked In and everyone greeted us with a smile. Decided to sit outside because the weather was perfect. Ordered two glasses of house wine, pretty good. My partner ordered their fettuccine Alfredo and I ordered the lasagna and we were both satisfied. I don't eat Italian much because it's heavy but if I ever get the craving I'll be back. To end the dinner the owner came by the table and said hello, BONUS... love the hospitality! Thanks again, we shall be back one day."}
{"text":"Tonight was the last night I got clowned by this place  I like a good Mac n Cheese and thought that I would go back on my word tonight to try it at this place.  I figured it would be good.  Man was I wrong!  First, it was a block 2 inches wide by a 5 inches long by 1.5 inches in height.  It didn't taste that good.  It was horrible if I\"m to be honest.  The real kick in the crotch was that I was at the Lux not far from there and passed on their mac n cheese to try this places.  And the Lux's mac n cheese is way better!  Not just better but 7 dollars with bacon and jalapenos.  The size is a little more, too."}
{"text":"Giuseppe's is like the mythical Phoenix Restaurant rising from the desert sun, simply amazing and out of this world .

What matters in the food universe is can restaurant provide amazing food, and the answer is \"YES\"! Giuseppe's creates a taste bud orgasms in waves. Been coming for several years and I love it! You can't lose when you eat here! Sure it's a tiny off the wall place, but who care's.. I don't need fancy decorations or overpriced wines to enjoy quality food like some of the reviewers of this establishment. Just give me quality food and I'm happy...

My favorite items are:

Chicken  Parm
Bolognese Ragu
Gnocchi with Red Sauce

and no meal is complete without eating this...

\"Italian Mac and Cheese - a layer each of parmigiano, mozzarella, fontina, prosciutto, cream and butter backed until golden brown\"

I could eat that everyday with any meal and would be in cheese paradise!"}
{"text":"This is a little Italian hidden Gem! The owner is sweet and polite and hospitable! A musician/chef/owner/manager wears all these coats very well!!!! Great food!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had takeout from this place today and can't say that I would ever go back.  You can chose which ever type of sauce to put on your pasta, but they barely put any at all...my pasta was very dry and hardly had any flavor.  I would rather have a microwave dinner."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Giuseppe's a few years ago by a co-worker. I was sort of skeptical given the strip mall location and paper-covered tables, but I should not have worried.

Giuseppe's is tiny; there are a few tables outside and maybe only three times as many inside.  You order and pay at the counter and sit wherever you'd like.  The menu is written on chalkboards above and beside the counter and is pretty extensive.  From bruschetta to salads, sandwiches to pasta, the place has everything.  Alcohol is not served, but Giuseppe's is BYOB. I have never not seen the dark-haired lady at the counter.  I'm not sure if she's the owner, but she is very friendly and warm.

I have enjoyed on multiple occasions their gnocchi with Cardinale sauce (a mixture of red and alfredo) and today, for the first time, the meatball sandwich.  Both are wonderful and the sandwich is very filling!  If you ask, you can even get a basket of crusty bread and butter before your meal (free at lunch, $3 at dinner).

Prior to today's visit, I hadn't been to Giuseppe's in at least two years. I definitely won't wait that long before my next visit!"}
{"text":"After hearing this restaurant was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives I suggested we take our friend here for her birthday because she LOVES Italian food. The restaurant was empty when we arrived and I was surprised how small the restaurant is. The guy behind the counter told us to take a seat so we did. We sat there for about 10 minutes and nothing. Do we order at the counter? My sister told me to ask but the guys behind the counter didn't even understand me when I asked if they had a restroom. Finally someone came over and asked what we wanted to drink and placed our order. We started out with the bruschetta, garlic bread, and some kind of cheesy pasta balls that were not very flavorful. The bruschetta was great and the garlic bread was good too. I asked for a side of marinara to dip my garlic bread in and it was really good. I am still daydreaming about that marinara sauce. Mmmm! My sister ordered spaghetti and meatballs, I ordered spaghetti carbonara with pancetta and egg, and the birthday girl ordered tortellini alfredo. Their portions were very small compared to my dish and I felt kind of bad. It looked like they got the kiddie portion! Despite the skimpy portions and spotty service everything tasted homemade and delicious."}
{"text":"Went to this place for dinner a few weeks ago and it was great.  Went there for lunch today and was disappointed. The food is consistently good however the lack of service killed the experience today. Unlike dinner for lunch you have to walk up to the counter and place your order, pay and retrieve your own plate when ready.  I sat in the middle table which was a big mistake as people kept coming in and I had ass and elbows side to side with people waiting to get to the counter.  With the amount of lunch business you think they cold have a server like dinner.  They also do not do half orders for lunch.  Sadly I will not return for lunch but will for dinner someday."}
{"text":"Where have you been all my life? I'm sitting here at the restaurant having a delicious and decadent lobster ravioli while thinking to myself, how is it possible that I didn't know about this place? The ingredients are quality, simple, fragrant, lovely texture, the lobster tastes fresh. Service is great, lovely intimate decor. I would definitely consider this place for a date night. The price is reasonable for the portion size and taking quality into mind I would say even generous. They give you a basket of fresh baked bread and butter, gloriously fluffy and tasty. This was such a pleasant surprise. I can't wait to come back. Ask for Cindy, she's a sweetheart and has great recommendations!"}
{"text":"To say that this place has capitalized on the notoriety created by Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives is quite an understatement.  They have more pictures of Guy Fieri in that place than I own pictures of myself.  I digress...

I've been by that location a thousand times and it took that stupid show to get me in the door.  I am quite surprised because I usually do a good job of being informed of great places and I've probably eaten at 5-6 other Italian places all within 5 miles of that place.  I digress again...

Anyways, I've been a couple of times now.  For lunch and for dinner.  The sandwiches offered at lunch are both tasty and reasonably priced.  They are not notably unique in any way but the quality is present.  The pastas served at dinner were more distinguished.  The bolognese is the second best in Phoenix behind Pinos.  The Osso Buco gets a lot of attention and rightfully so.  The service has been above par on both visits.

All told a great neighborhood place to eat, if you live or work in the neighborhood.  Just not quite good enough to merit the trek by itself."}
{"text":"Really liked the food and there was plenty of it. Started with bruschetta (pet peeve of mine when the servers pronounce this word incorrectly. The \"ch\" is pronounced like a hard \"k.\" Our server nailed it.) I had the osso buco which was fantastic. Homemade pasta came with it and the sauce had a nice bit of heat. Barry had the pasta carabonara. He was torn between that and the Bolognese and the waiter said \"want me to surprise you?\" And Barry said yes.

We each took about half home but managed to finish by splitting a cannoli made with fresh ricotta. Really excellent."}
{"text":"So we ordered butter squash ravioli, tortellini, hand made pasta and meatballs, and the Mac n cheese lasagne. We started with a sampler of bruschetta sever choice and she did awesome.

After dinner arrived we forgot to take pictures, all I can say is YUMMY! We all tried everyone's dish and they were delicious. 

It was well worth the stop."}
{"text":"Owned by chef Richard Bock and featured on 'Diners, Drive-ins and Dives' with Guy Fieri, Giuseppe's on 28th is a must for anyone living in the Phoenix area.

The experience starts with great service from Cindy, and then great conversation from Rich himself, who takes the time to visit every table, engages in interesting conversation and makes you feel at home.

It's obvious Rich has a passion for what he does, and it shows in both his words and his cooking.  Most of the menu is homemade and offers both classic and gourmet Italian dishes.  The food quality and portions are excellent, and they go out of their way to make sure you're dinner is a great experience.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Only tried their takeout, but very good food.  A little pricey, would like to try to eat in at some point."}
{"text":"Ordered the bolognese ragu as a takeout since the restaurant was about to close. I must say it was worth every overpriced penny I spent! LOLOL

Unfortunately, the almost 1/2 loaf of unseasoned and unbuttered Italian bread really detracted from the ragoodness (;) of the bolognese. It seems the thick broad noodles are hand made and the ragu was very meaty and rich. My entree was piping hot to boot.

The server who took my phone order was also courteous enough, but not overly so.

I plan to go back for the bolognese; not for the bread."}
{"text":"A true neighborhood place to dine. It's in Stripmall. No reservations cept for parties of 6 or more. I went traditional. I enjoyed the homemade Buffalo Mozzarella which came with arugula, pesto and Prosciutto and Balsamic. It comes with french bread and the waitress brought garlic bread as a free upgrade. The dish was absolutely fresh and delicious.  
I had the Tagliatelle Bolognese for main course. The homemade pasta was toothsome and perfectly cooked and the flavors of the sauce was so amazing. Our server could not have been more pleasant and we were NOT rushed at all even though it is such a small restaurant and many people waiting. 
Only knock and it's not that big a deal, but the wine list could be improved. I had craft beer with my meal and was very satisfied.     
          As an aside, I kept noticing people taking 5 gal. water bottles next door and leaving with the water and ice cream cones?? Turns out there is a business next door that provides reverse osmosis water, AND services Thrifty ice cream. Yummm. 
          I was in town for Cubs spring training. If I come back next year I will absolutely visit Giuseppe's again!"}
{"text":"I have been twice and both times have been treated like family. I loved how intimate it felt and how the staff treated us so great. I really enjoyed the garlic bread and tortellini. My husband was truly impressed with the baked ziti. You can tell that the pasta is homemade and it is always great when the staff is knowledgeable about the menu. 

My mother in law loved the music choice. Thanks again for the great time!"}
{"text":"Gueseppe's is hands down delicious Italian food!  The handmade pasta is delicious.  The Bolognese Ragu was so delectable with the 7 different meats hitting your palate.  The place is small so make sure you get reservations.  The owner is very nice and does a great job not only greeting everyone but making sure everyone feels like they are a part of something.  I cannot wait until I go back again!"}
{"text":"Service and food was excellent!! Red sauce is to die  for! Pregnant girl's dream!! Steve was an awesome Server. Order the risotto balls!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials are offered here and change daily.

Great place with good food.  Solid menu 
Gluten free pasta ( big plus) 

Penne with salmon and asparagus was darn good, as was Rigatoni with Sausage as they add sauteed spinach .Ravioli quartet (,portabello,cheese,meat,spinach) light and yum.

enjoyed the lentil soup here as well ( a while back)

if you live close by,  check this place out, it is a bit of a schlepp for me .. but we occasionally stop in and it has always been decent ."}
{"text":"WARNING!!!!!!!!!
    I was looking forward to having a nice chilled glass of wine with my dinner that you get with your Yelp check in.  Was dining with some other yelpers one of which also checked in and STEVE our waiter seemed confused by the Yelp coupon and looked at it as if an alien arrived to eat at the restaurant.  He then denied my use of the coupon.  He only allowed one person to use theirs.  There was nothing in the coupon or disclaimer that stated I could not use my coupon because someone else was.  Did I have to dine alone at the next table In order to use my coupon STEVE?  Not good for business.  Not at all.  Perhaps if you let me sample a glass of your wine I would have ordered some more.  Very offended."}
{"text":"We went to Scottsdale area for spring break last week, so I looked up restaurants on my \"Flavortown\" app, that show where Guy has reviewed (Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives).  Found this and told hubby we had to try it out one night.

We got there at about 5:45 or so on a Monday or Tuesday night - figuring no wait. We were wrong. It was already full (small, only maybe 10-12 tables inside), so put name on the list.  We waited maybe 20 minutes or so.  Worth the wait.

I got the pasta bolognese that they showed on the show. Delicious sauce with fresh, tender pasta.  Hubby and son got the chicken parm, their usual.  I was hoping hubby would try to osso buco so I could try that too, but oh well.  Daughter had fettucini alfredo. They liked their meals too.  They DO serve wine here now - so that must have changed since some of the past reviewers said it was BYOB.  We also had their fresh, homeade pink lemonade. LOVED it. Wow - fresh with some type of herb in it that was so good.

Glad we made the trip here after the afternoon spring training baseball game. A bit pricy I guess - for 4 of us, with just one glass of wine, I think we made it out for just under $90.  Friendly staff and it's a well-oiled machine. They'll take good care of you."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been eating g here for years. Italian food that taste like Italian food in Italy. If that makes sense."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoy this place. Second time here. Ate out on the front patio. It is in a strip mall but don't let that fool you. The food is really good and has good portions. Took some home for later. Yum. Glass of wine and a beer and I am a happy camper."}
{"text":"We tried giuseppe's on 28th last night for the first time.  We were lured into the restaurant because the it was featured on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives and our love of small Italian eateries.  My wife ordered the tortellini and I ordered linguini with white clam sauce,  garlic bread & avocado & tomato salad.  The bread was warmed in a an oven and came out dry and crusty.   the salad was the best thing we had.  My linquini was more like fettuccine but it was fresh/home made, nice and light. there was an abundance of clams but it so over salted I did not want to take the left overs home.  The marinara meat/sauce on my wife's tortellini was very thick and was okay. She ordered it with meatballs instead of sausage but it came out without the meatballs.  The waiter recognized the error and wanted to correct it.  The person next to me ordered the gnochi, which was my second choice, it looked very good and plentiful.  The restaurant is very small and cramped.  We sat next to two guys that were about two feet away, how ever there is seating outside.  The servers and the owner was very friendly and we received good service."}
{"text":"Went there in the late spring (End of April) and we had a large party that we had made reservations for. Unfortunately in spite of said reservations we still waiting nearly two hours before getting our table! We are all very hangry by the time we were seated, it was something beyond what Richard felt he could control. Once the wine began to flow and the appetizers hit our tummies all was beginning to be forgiven. When our entrees arrived, our hanger melted and we were happy . The ravioli, cannot be beat, the service, phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Been going here for years. Richard and his crew are great. Service with a smile. Indoor and outdoor seating. Was featured on the Food Network's Diners, Drive Ins and Dives."}

I was meh'd...

They have been on my bookmarks \"to try\" ever since the DDD episode. I wish I hadn't tried them...it was a disappointment. 

They are a fast food joint with high end prices. It was odd. FFFD (Fast Food Fine Dining)

The staff was extremely nice and inviting, personal and fun. I looked over the menu before entering and 3 employees offered assistance. I walked in and was directed to the counter, ordering as if I was placing an order to go. I told the guy 3 times I was going to eat here. I sat down at the table and he said \"oh you want it for here?\"

I sat at the table covered in white paper, like to draw on...(fast food) yet there was a battery operated candle thing. (Fine dining) There was Parmesan but no salt or pepper. OH... and a fake flower. 

He brought some bread, which was cold, some butter packets, which were cold and a plastic (throw-away) cup of water. I had finished my cold bread and my plate of pasta with meat sauce arrived. 

The pasta was good, the sauce had zero flavor. It was meaty but did not have a flavor at all. I tried a bit of Parmesan, nope. I asked for salt and pepper, didn't help. I was bumming. 

My meal, by myself, was $18.00 for a plate of noodles and boring meat sauce, and cold bread from Safeway. 

I will not be going back...."}
{"text":"I cannot express how much I love the food at this restaurant. I've never actually been inside because I order from them through a delivery service, but I drive past their sign all the time. I order about once or twice a week.

When you order a simple side salad, you don't expect anything really special. But whatever their herbed italian dressing recipe is, it makes a simple side salad special. Plus they are generous with it, and with long but thick carrot shavings, and ample onions. Yum.

Plus you get really soft delicious bread! I love mushing the bread around in the dressing first. 

Their gnocchi in vodka sauce is perfect 9 times out of 10. The tenth time it is only slightly less than perfect.

I love restaurants that are consistently good because I am a creature of habit and order the same thing repeatedly. This level of consistently delicious is hard to find. 

It is kind of odd being such a huge fan of a place I've never been inside, but man that food is good."}
{"text":"Nice and quaint...just like my buddy said.  I really appreciate restaurants putting their time into cooking.  They make their own pasta - YUM!  I got the special; Wild Boar with marinara and pasta; definitely different and definitely wild :)  Bottle wine?  Why yes please... I love the decor - I'm not a musician by any means except in my shower, but I'm sure the signed pictures of artists say a lot about this place.  The place is \"quaint\" remember so our service was on top of us; granted we were only 1 of the 2 tables in the place, but they did their jobs and they did it well - much appreciation.  The \"Boss\" :), was very friendly and greeted us with love too - I totally dig! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A winner, though pricey.  Italian wines, friendly faces (customers AND waitstaff) and phenomenal food!  Not to be confused with Guiseppesin Scottsdale."}
{"text":"A small little restaurant with big taste.

I had the pasta fagioli, casear salad and lasagna. The soup was excellent. Nice and light. The salad was superb!! Fresh crispy romaine lightly tossed with fresh dressing. Definitely not bottled.

The lasagna, although small in portion, was RICH. It was simple and not overpowered by sausage and frill. The cheese...oh my the cheese! They do not skimp on cheese. Every single fattening cheesy bite was worth it!

It was nice to see the owner in there and he gladly took a picture with our group. Very cool!"}
{"text":"We ordered 5 entrees.


6 meat Ragu sauce was undeniably good but the homemade pasta was just  \"meh\". It was too doughy and not al dente enough.

Carbonara - It was okay. I feel like it's something I can make at home 

Sausage/Spinach Pasta - I also feel like it's something I can make at home. $14.95 (Kind of pricey if you ask me). 

Dessert - Tiramisu $5.95/slice. It was huge and it was just \"okay\". 

It's a small 8 table restaurant.  The owner did come by our table to greet us but he was not as friendly to us as to other patrons. Is it because we were not \"Caucasian\"? (Hmmm)

Nothing spectacular and they charge $4.00 for garlic bread (SEE MY PHOTOS). It's NOT the best type of garlic bread I have ever had. It's not crispy and it does not have the garlic spread flavor to it. Bread was too soft. 

I would not come back. 

*REALLY TACKY SIGNAGE ON THE FRONT SIGN OF THE RESTAURANT* (It says \"Featured on Food Network\"). 

Just because it's on Food Network show, it doesnt mean it's ALL that good. 

Waitress- She was super friendly."}
{"text":"This place makes me happy.  I love the purity of it.  Its a super small place, nestled in a retail center next to a water and ice store.  The same staff is always there, including the owner. Service is typically straight forward and gets the job done.  To me, its all about the fresh pasta. I can't seem to steer away from the Bolognese ragu. Its actually pretty light with long pasta and ground meats (7 different kinds?)   My wife usually goes with the gnocchi, which she raves about as well. We tried the bruschetta, definitely go for the fig, goat and prosciutto.  The wine list is very fair. Most bottles are 90+ and around $30-$40.  2 critical thoughts: Remove the \"As seen on Dives, Diners and Drive-ins\" on the front sign, let the food stand it for itself. Add fresh grated parmesan instead of the store bought pizza shakers.  

Overall, a big fan of this place. Not going to impress a hot date with the ambiance, and can get loud due to small size, but its simply all about the food."}
{"text":"Well I held out on writing a review based off my 1st experience,  which was two weeks ago.  I called in a order to carry out.  I ordered shrimp fettuccine Alfredo with fig and marscopone purchtuo burchettas. When I got home it was terrible.  The pasta is home made so it's super thick.  Four small shrimp and hardly no Alfredo sauce, I mean dry. That fake bruccetta is hard and dry.  So I called a spoke to Cindy and explained that I lived far from the location.  It practically took me an hour to get there and I couldn't come back.  So she put the owner in the phone and we worked out a deal that I would get a $27.00 credit the next time I came in. 

Fast forward to today which was a couple of weeks later. When I arrived Cindy wasn't there but the owner Richard was.  So I explained who I was and he remembered. So he said I can give you a $17.00 credit because you ate the meal didn't you?  I didn't even touch that dry mess. So being pressured and embarrassed of what the phone conversation was and what he was saying to my face and the place was packed and I didn't want to argue.  I just ordered their signature dish, the Osso buco to- go again. So the waiter rang me up and I ended up paying them about $15.00 additional dollars.  I was pissed off. But I figured well maybe it will be worth it.

I get home and make nice salads for me and my husband to accompany the meal still with high hopes because it looks good and the meat is falling off the bone. So we eat it with disappointment.  The sauce is tasteless I mean no flavor at all the bread was dry.

I will never return. I will go to Olive garden which I far better than this place. Or just wait to go back to New York and eat authentic Italian at Carmine's or Rao's in Vegas. Or for great bruccettas go to Postionos.

I don't know why this place is crowded.  The food is bland and it's so tiny.  I have been to several DDD destinations this one is a BIG miss."}
{"text":"We moved to Az last December and really miss our old Italian haunts back home so we saw this on DDD and thought we would give it a try. My wife and I both ordered the Capellini with meat ball and a basket of bread. The bread was really disappointing, we could get better bread at the bakery in any grocery store, definitely not Italian bread. The Capellini was so so, the meat sauce was very bland with no destinctive flavor of any kind, very disappointing. We are used to going to St. Louis and eating on the Hill section where the neighborhood is famous for great little Italian spots. Back home we had a nice little four star Italian spot called Paparazzi's, and no one has ever come even close to there quality and service, anyone ever visiting Peoria Illinois needs to try this place if they want top notch Italian food.  Our bill was $40 with tip, rather high for the quality of food, service and atmosphere we experienced."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night after watching Pbs's Check Please! Arizona. The food was fantastic! It is small, smaller than it seemed on t.v., the staff are very friendly and the ambiance is not high end but most were dressed business casual. I'd rather overdressed than under (imho).

For cocktails...I had the Limoncello Martini, not too sweet and very cold just perfect for me. My husband had a Chianti, which I also had with supper, though we like our reds slightly chilled it was great accompaniment to our meal.

Appetizers - The Burrata: house made mozzarella (filled with mozzarella and cream!) on top of prosciutto, arugula with pesto and balsamic and the Suppli di Riso (risotto rice balls) served on house made tomato sauce . The Burrata was hands down the winner! In fact I told my husband it was one of the best appetizers I have ever had. My husband liked the Risotto rice balls a lot more than I did. I ate one he ate the other two...but the Burrata had to be shared to the last bite. Also had garlic bread which was really nicely done; slightly blackened just a bit crunchy on the outside and soft in the center. 

Entrees - When I go for Italian I like to order what I don't cook at home so I had the Lasagna (it's a lot of work for two). This was more cheesy than meaty but that's a good thing because it was creamy and soft (almost silky texture) and the tomato sauce had a slight savory tartness to it that pleased my palate. My husband had the Bolognese Ragu (between 5-7 meats) with house made tagliatelle...this is a seriously delicious meal! The tagliatelle is thick (good thing) and rustic but then paired with that Ragu, wow. It was full flavored, rich, savory, absolutely scrumptious.

We shared the Tiramisu which was very good. The texture is more fluffy (more creamy mascarpone) versus meatier (more lady fingers). My husband felt it could have been a bit more coffee flavored....but we ate the whole thing.

The portions were good for us. I could only eat 1/2 my Lasagna and my husband ate all his Ragu and said I should have taken his plate (and bread) away from him before he had finished! We'll be back..."}
{"text":"This place is so fake it's sickening- the server Cindy is phony. Jose is a dick - and the owner- couldn't make the time to take my credit card. The salad dressing was tasteless and the Osso Bucco was just okay."}
{"text":"The butternut squash ravioli was the best I've ever had. I have stopped thinking about it and am dying to get it again!!"}
{"text":"If when you go out for Italian Food and you think that Olive Garden, Buca di Beppo or even Babbo has great Italian Food, Giuseppe's is probably NOT the place for you. 

If like me, you grew up thinking that your friend Vinnie's mothers daily offering of Italian Food, with aromas wafting all through the apartment building, was something very special and real Italian Food - THIS IS IT! You will have found Nirvana, as have I!

Until now, I had almost given up hope for what I call \"Old World Italian Food\" prepared with love and the most incredible ingredients available. It is here and being served in a friendly small environment by a knowledgeable and wonderful wait staff.  Not to mention that  the Owner is usually present and generally talks to everyone, making certain that all are satisfied. Now I ask you, is that PRIDE or what?

Based on talking with adjacent Diners, everything on the Menu;  both the \"Today's Menu\" (Changes sometimes daily) and the \"Full Menu,\" seems to be pretty fabulous and receiving \"Rave Reviews\" from my fellow Diners!

Looking at previous Reviews, as well as Guy Fieri's recommendation, I had to have the Bolognese Ragu on my first visit. I have yet to have everything on the menu, but here are the choices I have made on my visits to date and each is NOT to be missed:

        Bolognese Ragu - Don't ask! Just order it. Seven meats and homemade  
        Pasta that lives up to all of the previous fabulous Reviews! Like so many 
        before me, I am not certain I can eat here ever without having this incredible 
        dish, which leaves little room for anything else. Share with a friend so you can 
        have more of their remarkable dishes.

        Burrata (Appetizer) - Mozzarella like you have never had. Do NOT overlook it 
        if  it is available. The description doesn't do it justice, but it is described as 
        a \"ball of mozzarella filled with shredded mozzarella and cream.\" If you love 
        Mozzarella -this is \"MOZZARELLA MECCA!\" 

        Antipasto (Appetizer) - An absolute work of art! Do NOT be fooled by the 
        Menu designation of Small (they also have Large), it is NOT small, but can be 
        shared by two (I refuse to share!)  Incredible morsels of meat, cheese and 
        vegetables, with the proper amount of dressing.

        Pasta e Fagioli (Appetizer) - I have a friend who says you can judge ALL 
        Italian Restaurant by their Pasta e Fagioli. This is a light (meant to be, it's an 
        Appetizer!) flavorful mixture of beans and pasta that is oh so satisfying, with 
        just a hint of spice.

        Spaghetti and our Famous Meatballs - Not to be confused with your Mothers, 
        as she probably could not make this rendition. The meatballs in my sampling 
        were made from Veal with Ricotta and other special ingredients. If spaghetti 
        and meatballs were like this everywhere, we would all be Italian! Hint - you 
        can have the meatballs alone as an appetizer or a side dish.

        Bread and Olive Oil - Nothing remarkable about the bread here, which is a 
        surprise, but it is the Olive Oil (with Giuseppe's label on it) that is the star. No 
        Balsamic needed, just pure goodness with salt and pepper to your own taste. 
        Take a bottle home (I have!) and pair it with your favorite bread.

Giuseppe's has definitely replaced The Restaurant (Now Pizzeria Bianco) as my favorite Phoenix Italian Restaurant. The love, pride and caring that has gone into each and every dish is more than apparent. There is no need to go elsewhere, unless for a diversion you wish to go to Andreoli Italian Grocer for their bread! Between these two you will be in \"Italian Food Heaven!\""}
{"text":"Finally!!  Finally!! I am able to get some good Italian food in Arizona.  I am a bit spoiled since I lived in upstate NY for a month so I was ready for the real deal.  Of course I found about this place because of DDD.

Now it is a very intimate little restaurant with no fluff but with excellence service.  Why would not be ok with that if the food is good.  It is not very big on the inside or out but it will be worth any wait that you encounter.  The owner made a point of coming by every table and talking with his customers.  We learned that he played the cello in an orchestra over in Italy and he brought back the amazing recipes he cooks today.  He is an absolute delight to speak with so if you can, make sure you learn about him.  

I like to branch out and try other things but that darn bolognese is so good.  It has like six or seven different meats in it.  Really?  I was in heaven.  We also tried the brushcetta, tiramisu, and cannoli. I know that lots of people rave about the osso bucco and that is next on my list.  Darn I think everything is good. 

I even saw people getting takeout and the only reason I don't is because I live in the east valley.   I love this place and go back on a regular basis.  My sister thought I went back without her today and was ready to fight me.  Ha ha!!  Support local businesses people and you will get an amazing, unique experience in return."}
{"text":"Wild Boar Ragu is a delectable treat for the taste buds. Supreme flavourful sauce on the house made fresh pasta. The best pasta dish in the world!

The risotto balls are also a great appy.

tiny and intimate, with some outdoor street cafe seating. We came the first time because we saw it on Triple D, but we come back again and again because the pasta is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place deserves a five star because it is everything it's trying to be.  Casual dining, great food, friendly environment.  I agree that they need to loose the Triple D name dropping reference on the sign.  They don't need it."}
{"text":"I 'm surprised I'm giving this place a 2, but I wouldn't go back.  First off it is very tiny and the tables are soooo close to each other, you can hear your neighbors breath!  I got spaghetti and meatballs which was OK, not a lot of flavor, but not awful, certainly not worth $13, c'mon it's in a strip mall and I've seen walk-in closets as big as this place. It's over priced IMO. The most irritating part of the meal was the waiter, his fake accent , & attempt at humor.  He failed all the way around."}
{"text":"In an area known for flashy restaurants and overblown bars, it was a treat to find such a hidden gem like Giuseppe's. Everything is good. Seriously, everything, plus the wine selection fits the feel of the place, and the staff is professional, knowledgable and always down to suggest something if you're on the fence with what to order. 

The bolognese is just delicious, the gnocchi is hard to beat and all the specials on the board are worth a look. 

Go here and impress the naysayers that will be confused when you tell them the best Italian in town is in a strip mall. I've never taken someone here who left disappointed."}
{"text":"I will admit, had it not been for Triple D on Food Network, I probably wouldn't have heard of this place. I am glad I am an avid viewer of this channel. My father, being the martyr that he is, decided he didn't want to go to dinner for his 55th birthday. So after some hemming and hawing, I bullied him into it. The next question, Where do we go? I told him about this recent episode of Triple D and to my amazement he had seen it to and suddenly he was all happy about a birthday dinner. 

Like most places nowadays, they don't take reservations. My brother called ahead and was told it should be fine for our time for a table of 8, a Wednesday night mind you. We were seated and take everyone else's word if not mine, the restaurant is small(read:TINY). There are probably 12 tables, max. We were given menus quickly and had our drink orders taken and brought out promptly. The table started with a mixed bruschetta of a traditional tomato and basil and a pesto with tomato. Both were excellent. They have a bunch of other choices as well. We also had the caprese salad, fresh balls of mozzarella, tomatoes, and romaine covered in balsamic vinegar. This too was great. 

Dinner choices were varied. I had a fettuccine with chicken, green chilies, and sun dried tomato. It had a garlic-wine sauce. Sprinkle on a little red pepper flakes for a little extra heat and you'll be happy. Get the fresh pasta, pay the extra buck, and you'll be one smiling mother#$*&er! Fresh pasta makes a world of difference. I sampled everything at the table. The macaroni and cheese with prosciutto, the ravioli, and the penne with sausage. The regular plain old red pasta sauce they use is great! It had such a nice sweetness to it I could have had a bowl of it.  Get the mac & cheese.  It is baked to perfection!  We aren't talking Kraft mac and cheese here either people.  This has real cheese, not some powder cheese.

We also indulged in dessert and coffee. The flour-less chocolate cake with vanilla bean gelato was delicious. The cappuccino was great too. I was told the key lime cheesecake was good as well. 

The dining experience was nice. I thought the prices were reasonable and the serving size ample. We spoke with the owner, Richard, for long stretches throughout the meal and he was very personable and answered any questions or gave suggestions on meals. He saw me taking a picture of my food and asked if this was going to be on Yelp! I assured him it would be. He told me I wasn't getting anything free because of it, with a smile and a laugh. Love the NY attitude. 

For those that gave a bad review, I'm sorry, but I just don't get it. NO other Italian restaurants in the valley use fresh pasta, maybe Pasta Brioni. So, if you thought Buca, Olive Garden(barf), or Macaroni Grill used it, you are sadly mistaken."}
{"text":"Stopped by here the other day to pick up dinner for Hubby and I because we had a Living Local coupon that was getting ready to expire. I have also always loved their pasta and this time was no different. I ordered the Veal Osso Buco and the Butternut Squash Ravioli for the two of us to share. Usually I just love the Osso Buco but this time it seemed as if it was a little fattier and greasier than usual. The pasta part of it was good but it seemed as if there was a lot of waste from the bone as well as a tremendous amount of oil that remained in the to go container and on our plates. We both loved the Ravioli and the browned butter sauce that is served over the top is superb!"}
{"text":"First impression: Not great. We had menu shock when we saw the dinner prices. Dinner for 2 here, will run you around $50 or more. For prices in that range with this atmosphere, it's appalling that they serve drinks in plastic party cups, and soda comes in a can.... No refills. Seriously. The food... Meh. I've had better for half the price... Actually a third of the price. Just because they were featured on food network, doesn't mean it's worth going to. In fact... Restaurants PAY THOUSANDS to shows like DD&D just to be featured."}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've had in a long time. As a Brooklynite who has been traveling for most of this year, I was happy to discover Giuseppe's is ran just like the old classic pizzerias I'm used to. Rich, the owner, even came over and helped talk to me & my friend, who were traveling through the southwest. That's when I realized he himself was from New York as well! Our server was a sweet, attentive, older woman who knowledgably guided us through the menu. The perfect meal: all the ingredients were fresh ( we enjoyed the mozzarella bursts over prosciutto and arugula // 4 different types of bruschetta // and hand made chicken parm) What a breathe of fresh air! I recommend this place to all locals and tourists alike."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service (seafood squid ink pasta, lasagna, butternut squash ravioli, and lamb ravioli were all delicious) from Romero...and also met owner Richard. Great atmosphere, patio heaters! Bottle of Pinot Grigio and Tiramisu were also to die for. We will be back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I have to say my visit today was a letdown. We had the risotto rice balls that were clearly not made fresh as the breaking was soggy and not crispy the way it should be. The meatballs were okay and slightly above average size, but $2 each?  Out pasta dinners were very good though. My carbonara was good as it usually is. My gf had a sausage with broccoli rabe that was good, but it could have done with a bit less oil. Considering the prices, I expected more. It has been a few months since I have been here and the prices seem to have gone up on several items."}
{"text":"Ok, so I thought I'd try this Triple D's place while I was in the area.  First off, I think the show got to the owner's head!  The 'As seen on Food Network' sign should have been a tip off, but I wanted to try the Pasta Bolognese that Guy raved about on the show.  The shop is extremely small with maybe seating for about 30.  The tables were squeezed in togther so if it was a full house, it would be difficult to walk around.  The chairs were cheap plastic chairs.   Not what I would have expected for an Italian restaurant.  Weird thing is I had to order at the front window and pay on the spot like I was ordering take out.  Really??  I ordered the Bolognese and an Iced Tea and my bill came to $24 dollars (included tip before even tasting anything!  Sheez)  The hostess served up some bread with some very cold butter packets first and then the pasta came out.  The homemade pasta was pretty good in taste and texture, but Bolognese depressed me!  I dont know how they did it, but it was dry and missing that mixed flavor of the vegetable ingredients.  Maybe it was overcooked or bottom of the barrel for my dish?  Who knows really cept that I was not impressed.  I tried it once,, and I'll pass from going again.."}
{"text":"This place is an Italian joint. The pasta with red sauce is good. I had the chicken parmesan recently, and it is not something I would order again. The chicken was simmered in water or boiled and had an odd flavor, to no flavor. Then it was topped with red sauce and cheese, but you could still taste the odd chicken flavor. In other words, the sauce and cheese couldn't help it. The red sauce and pasta is flavorful. I've had the eggplant parmesan before, it's better than the chicken. The waiter has been there a long time and is amazing at providing service. She waits all of the tables and is able to get everything right. I felt bad for her because Giuseppe was angry with her about something and made himself look like a tyrant of sorts, which is NOT good for customers to see. This place is very small and it would have been hard to miss his temper tantrum. She took it all in stride however...so because of her, we'll be back for another try."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a work colleague from out of town who wanted Italian food. I found this place and the menu looked good. They were not busy when we got there but were expecting a larger party later. Weirdly the sat us right next to where the large party was going to be. Not sure why but the placement was weird since they had other open two tops. The server gave us the run down of specials. We decided to split a ceasar salad and we ordered entrees. The ceasar was ok could have used more dressing. The bologonese ragu however was AMAZING!! Some of the best pasta I have ever eaten. My colleague also commented on his chicken parm and said the pasta was very good. The server was very slow in picking up the check but she had gotten busy with more tables and the larger party by that time. But overall it was very good and I will be back with my husband next time!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but don't set your expectations too high. Good thing it's only $1 extra for homemade pasta, I couldn't tell the difference. 
All in all, good but not worth a long wait!"}
{"text":"This place makes you feel like you have arrived at your Italian's grandmothers house, at least that's what the food tasted like! It was amazing. Great recipes if I may say! I was blown away by how good my dinner was...oh and of course you can't forget the bread! Thanks for the experience Giuseppe's it was excellent, your staff was friendly and extremely professional. They kept coming around to fill our glass with water and to make sure the food was good. We even had the manager or owner come up to the table to check on us! WOW! 
The decor was fun and funky. Even though the place was small, it's pleasant and it's probably a good idea to make a reservation.
If ever in Phoenix again I would definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"We saw this restaurant on Check Please and had to try it. The food and service was very good. We had the wild boar, Santa Fe pasta with chicken and a calamari appetizer.  We like spicy and were pleased with the heat, and also that they do not use too much salt. Also, they serve up the calamari flash pan fried and not deep fried and so expose their ability to cook rather than hiding things under batter. The calamari was great and the sauce nice to sop up with bread. It was very Italian and even the ambiance was pleasant. A recommendation is for them to add a lobster tail (ala Arthur Avenue) for desert:)"}
{"text":"We went here on a fluke as the place we wanted to go had a long wait.  This place didn't have one and now we know why.   The owner or manager was rude to us from the start. We were seated then ignored for about 10 mins.  We started to look at yelp and looking for other options as we were ready to just leave since we weren't being served.  The manager picked up on our conversation and proceeded to tell his wait staff to get over to us NOW.  We finally got a waitress, and proceeded to order.  First of all they charge for bread.  Regular or garlic.  Which is fine. But they offer it like it's free and then there is the fact that it is stale and awful.  The portions were small.  The flavor was eh.  And the service was bad.  I also noticed the manager cleaning a table, putting his fingers in the dirty glasses, then going over and making roll ups of silver ware.  I watched as he touched the tongs on the forks with his dirty hands.  That alone is reason enough for me to NEVER go back.  Basically just an awful experience.  And no wonder there was no wait at 7:30pm on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Went here because I knew that it was on Diners, Drive In's and Dives and really enjoyed the family atmosphere and the food.  Getting to hear about the experiences to this place after national televised exposure was absolutely amazing.  The expansion they have had to do and the quality service and food they provided while doing all that is amazing.  I will definitely go back when I get back to the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I was sworn to secrecy when we first came here with friends several years ago.  I think it's some of the best Italian in town.  It isn't fancy (a plus, in my book).  It's small, so sometimes there can be a wait involved. Even though its small, because of the very personal service by the owner, the service can be lacking or distracted.  The food, however, is well worth it!   I try to get something new each time I go, and I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I simply love this place!  Being grin back east,  i grew up with good Italian food in neighborhood kitchens as well as restaurants.   This food is the real deal...which Phx sorely needs more of.  

Thus is the only Italian restaurant in Phx i take guests to... this is def the real deal!!!"}
{"text":"After hearing my sister who lives in California tell me about this place for weeks after she saw it on the Food Network, I was finally in the vicinity and able to check it out. 

It's a very small place, Very Small. Cozy. 

Lots to choose from on their chalkboard menu, we were greeted upon entry and told to come up and order when we were ready.

We ordered a ceaser salad, the Risotto Balls, Delicious balls of risotto with mozzarella cheese inside then lightly rolled in bread crumbs and fried with a side of marinara. Fresh Pasta Fettuccini Alfredo with Chicken and Gnocchi with Tomato Cream Sauce.

I thought the prices seemed a little high, but honeslty after tasting the food I didnt care.

First of all everything came out piping HOT, including other diners dishes, you could see the steam rising throughout the restaurant!

My husband always orders Fettuccini Alfredo with Chicken and he said this was his Favorite and best he's ever had!
 I had a few bites and  it was truly delicious with the fresh pasta and roasted pulled chicken and just the right amount of sauce, it had great flavor!

My Gnocchi was no exception, those tasty little morsels of cheesy mashed potatos if you will and the Tomato Cream sauce was excellent as well although I wish there had been just a tad more sauce.

Our ceasar salad was large enough to share, fresh greens dressed just right but unfortunately no croutons or parmesean?

The bread and butter was really tasty too!

All in all, we had a great experience and would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Was on season 6 of Diners, Dives and Drive-ins.
Small family owned Italian restaurant in Phoenix, AZ
11-12 tables, very friendly staff great customer service
I had a salad, mac-n-cheese with house red wine and bread
Mac-n-cheese was good, baked through using pasta rather than macaroni noodles.  Salad was simple with balsamic/vinegar dressing"}
{"text":"Giuseppe's is a true gem. Everything on the menu is first rate, but if you don't see what you have a hankering for, the kitchen will occasionally indulge special orders and I've always been very impressed by the plate set before me. The owner is old school good people. Salt of the earth type.  His passion for food permeates the place and you feel better as a person for having gone there."}
{"text":"I've had this on my list for some time. The burratta appetizer was outstanding!  The garlic bread was so simple but some of the best I've ever had. I had the lemonciello pasta with prosciutto. The pasta was handmade and the sauce good but next time, I try something more traditional. The meat sauce smelled amazing. Yes-very small place but great, friendly service and outstanding Italian!  Have to work my way through the menu!!"}
{"text":"the pros: 
a) freshly made pasta has to be the best i've had in a very long time. i think it's even better than any restaurant i've been to in manhattan's little italy. 
b) the veal osso bucco and bolognese were really good. 
c) the shrimp & calamari in squid ink pasta was unique. 
d) the mac n cheese was scrumptious. 
the cons: 
a) the meatball is too small and lacked flavor. 
b) the bread was nothing special. 
c) if u have more than 3 people in your party, u may wanna call first or try to get there before the crowd because it's a small restaurant. 
overall: come here to try the freshly made pasta, osso bucco, and the mac n cheese."}
{"text":"I loved this place. We actually didn't have a wait at all so I'm not sure why everyone else did. The place is definitely small, but I liked it. It felt less like a chain laid out for maximum amount of getting people in and out and more like a place that was made in homage to good food where you could sit and have a nice long meal. 

We went there after the food network special and got the bolognese - it was really delicious. The food isn't too expensive, it's all the add-ons. When you go there you just can't help order an appetizer, a meal, a bottle of wine AND dessert. 

It's totally worth a visit if you haven't been yet!"}
{"text":"Used to live in the nearby apartments and would enjoy one of their delicious meals at least once a week (Batchelor!).  Since those days I try to make it back at least a few times a year and usually bring friends along who nearly always remark that they didn't even know it existed.  This most recent visit we had the eggplant appetizer which was cut thin, lightly cooked, sprinkled with some mozzarella and enjoyed greatly by all.  All 4 entrees were completely eaten with mmmm comments in between bites.  A couple of us even savored the Spumoni for desert which the other 2 promptly sampled as well (Hey!  Get your own!).  Parking can be a nightmare so patience is needed and there is currently some construction on the facade of all the strip malls businesses but don't be daunted!  Will continue to return whenever I want to have a comfortable, delicious Italian meal, lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"It was Friday, 3/9/18.  We made sure we'd stop by during Spring Training once more. We loved the food.  Along with the baseball, this is one place we were anticipating.  
Made a reservation for 7:00, dinner did not hit out table until 8:07.  It was busy on Friday, but an hour was a long wait.  The brushetta with several flavors was really great.  Very recommended. 
Then, the wait started.....
The butternut squash I had waited two years to savor once more.....very little flavor.  Minimal squash, mostly pasta.  Drowned in what seemed more like margarine than butter.  Wife had the Wild Boar Ragu.  Tasted  like ground beef with Prego. We were not happy with the food at all.  In hindsight, multiple orders of the brushetta would have been the ticket. 
Key lime pie was really good.
Ordered decaf coffee as it was late in the evening for regular coffee.  It was watered down coffee.  How do you mess up coffee?
The only thing I could think of was the cooks on those other days were off this night. It happens. We'll look out for a new place to make our new \"traditional\" spot during next Spring Training. 
Maybe we should focus on Spring Training baseball when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Flawless experience! Service was amazing, very friendly staff! Great lil mom and pop type feel to it. Food was out of this world. Very laid back atmosphere.. Nice surprise for a little hole in the wall Italian restaurant. The lasagna and veal meatballs were on point!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but not worth waiting 60 minutes for. Our bolognese dishes were pricey...and not oversized. It was my first time here and couldn't compare to an earlier time. There are so many other great restaurants in the area that I would not return here."}
{"text":"Beware:  Only one Free with per table with check-in!!!!  It doesn't say that in the ad.

This place was on Triple D with Guy Fieri.   Not sure why.

Soup - no taste

Pasta - fresh but mushy

Fettuccine Carbonara - overly salty 

Asked for a side of chicken on a salad.  $3 for three tiny chunks of meat.

Italian restaurant and no bread on table.  

Needless to say.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place!

A bit cramped, and theres always a wait. Totally. Worth it.

We came here for our anniversary after seeing the Diners Drive Ins and Dives episode it was featured in. Loved it.

The pasta is so fresh and delicious....weve been here several times and never had a bad item off the menu."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with girlfriend after friend sent me link for Guy Fieri's show & I assembled the 9 eateries he had on his list in AZ.

Had Penne Pasta with asparagus, mushrooms, scallions & red pepper flake which was amazing.

Tiramisu was decent but not spectacular."}
{"text":"Really?! Who else finds it incredibly tacky that they added \"As seen on food network\" on their sign? 

Me thinks that a visit from Guy has made your head big. I enjoyed the food here before Guy visited. 

Now the service is rude, the prices are sky high and the food quality is down. I have given them the benefit of the doubt and eaten here a couple of times after the Guy visit. Every time it has gotten worse. I would much rather go to La Piazza Al Forno. 

The meatballs were small and tasteless, the sauce was very sweet. The lasagna used to be really good here but the last 3 times it has gotten smaller and costs more and the flavor is disappearing with the portion size. Overall to pricey for what you get. 

Again that sign is just plain old tacky and is enough of a reason to make me go elsewhere. In my opinion a stupid move. Maybe Gordon Ramsey should visit and give Giuseppe a much needed reality check!"}
{"text":"Let's talk ravioli! After the first bite of my ravioli quartet, I felt like I had been transported to Tuscany! The creamy sauce on top took the dish to the next level. I mean, they make fresh home-made fettuccini- who makes home-made pasta nowadays?  

It was quite refreshing to see pan seared calamari instead of deep fried. The sauce that the calamari was soaked in tasted phenomenal with some garlic bread!

Giuseppe's has a very homey feel- small tables for a romantic lunch or dinner for two.  

Overall, two thumbs up for this quaint restaurant find. Next time, I will try the butternut squash ravioli!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Italian cuisine. I am not usually a Italian food loved but this place is great. I will definitely go back. A woman in my party, has been to Italy twice and is knows her Italian cuisine and she even said this was spot on. Highly recommend it. It definitely deserves more stars. The owner was also very nice and came buy to check in and talk to use. Even recommended places to eat where we weren't from Phoenix."}
{"text":"Pros: Lots of variety on the menu. Clean, warm, and welcoming. Casual dining, close to our home, easy to find, and plenty of parking.

Cons: Sometimes, they cut their home made pasta too thick; but I don't mind. Traditional, heavy Italian dishes. Not for people who are on diets."}
{"text":"It's so funny...these people take the time to post the menu for each day online...and then don't have it.   We planned all week to eat Osso Bucco on Saturday, and then they don't have it!  Someone forgot to heat it up...that's what they said!   Service?  Ugh.  Food?  How would I know?  they couldn't come up with my entree!

Now we're down to 2699 OTHER Italian restaurants in this town to try..."}
{"text":"Really cool little place.  Went with basic spaghetti and meatballs.  They suggested I sub their fresh made fettuccine for the spaghetti noodles - wow, great call.  Meatballs were melt in your mouth good!  I'll go back my next trip to Phoenix for sure."}
{"text":"I find these 5 star reviews to be incredibly suspicious. We just got back from returning our ***70 dollar take-out order*** (which consisted of 2 gnocchi, 1 bolognese, and 1 linguini and clam sauce, by the way) to a very rude and egotistical owner. We called beforehand to merely voice our concerns about this incredibly expensive, yet mediocre meal. The owner answered the phone and was not only unconcerned, but was very argumentative, saying that he \"only gets a complaint once every 2 months\" and that he has a \"packed house.\" He made us feel like our opinions didn't matter in the least bit. He begrudgingly told us to bring our food back for a refund, so we did just that. When we arrived, he met us outside and argued with us a bit more, emphasizing that his 20 seat restaurant was full. When we tried to explain our concerns with the food, he said \"whatever\" and left, shortly returning with our refund.
Food:
-Clam and fettuccine-far too salty
-Tomato sauce- tastes like canned
-Gnocchi-mushy, no texture
-Bolognese-no flavor

Bottom line:
-Rude, arrogant owner
-Bland,over-priced food
-Never returning!!

I really didn't want to have to write this review, since I live in the neighborhood and want this place to be good. Before it appeared on Food Network, although expensive, this place was quite good. I just don't want anyone else to waste their time and money when there are so many other good Italian restaurants to eat in Phoenix. (e.g. Aiello's)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I drove here after seeing it on \"triple d\". 
We got there just before the rush and were seated pretty quickly.

The osso bucu was...okay. Big hunk of pork with alot of bone on okay pasta.... The sauce was WAAY watery and just flicked all over the place. The pasta seemed a little on the heavy side. The pork was pretty tender...but eh...$20 for this is way way way to much. 

My girlfriend had the bolognese. \"It was good, but tasted like stroganoff\". I have to agree. The noodles were a little dry. They said it had 6 meats, but you couldn't tell because it was all ground together. $16 for this is also way to much. 

$3 basket of bread...bread was good, but waaay over priced.

I think the best part was the non-fried calamari. Very tasty. 

Though, we felt a little rushed out the door with our child (who didn't enjoy the experience) as some polite customers decided to take over the place with a party of 8 and 5. 

We wont be going back here. Much better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is tiny but very homey and welcoming. The service was fantastic. Our waitress was a middle aged lady who was super friendly. The other servers who brought out the food were also incredibly friendly. They were attentive to refilling our wine and taking away plates.
For appetizers we got the burrata, which was a soft mozzarella sitting in a bed of arugula with prosciutto and balsamic vinegar, garlic bread, and calamari. Burrata was delicious, the flavors complimented each other perfectly. I will pass on the garlic bread in the future, it was nothing special and could have used more butter and garlic. I can't say a lot about the calamari as I'm not a fan of it in general. 
For my main course I ordered a pasta with broccolini and sausage. It had a lot of green stuff in it which was great! The sausage was slightly spicy which I didn't like. Next time I will go more basic with what I order - like lasagna. 
I was really impressed with this tiny little restaurant! Will definitely become my husband and I's go-to Italian spot."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix, definitely the best Italian in town I've had. Everything is so fresh, made from scratch and delicious; I love their homemade pasta! They also offer gluten-fee pasta, which I greatly appreciate. Yum! The service is also very friendly."}
{"text":"I went for dinner to Giussepes and really enjoyed my experience. If you're looking for an authentic Italian meal, this is the place!

The location/venue doesn't do the location much justice. It's in a \"meh\" shopping plaza next to sprouts. So, initially, it doesn't feel very special. The staff and the food, on the other hand, make the experience fantastic! All of the pasta is hand-made in house!

Met the owner, Rich, and he is an awesome guy who cares most about quality and authenticity. 

Great for a quiet dinner. I ate bruschetta, chicken parm, paired with a delicious cab-mix wine and ended things with a crème brulée. I was basically in heaven.

Overall, I would give this place 5 stars, but I gave them 4 because I wish they had a nicer venue."}
{"text":"Was a Great find ., awesome food, I ordered the Chicken Parmesan. Casual Setting but very intimate"}
{"text":"Wow this place has gotten a LOT of bad reviews! I am surprised. I do not consider this a bad place. I was stuffed from the 6 meat sauce plus homemade noodles, my husband had the Oso Busco. It is small, but they do not force you out or make you feel uncomfortable talking over your meal (unlike some other restaurants). 
My food was lovely and a generous portion, we did have desert and coffee as well. 
For those of you who had a bad server or a bad run in with \"the boss\" I did not have that experience at all. The service was friendly, and the boss was helping some VERY nasty people at a table near us and trying to be accommodating as best as he could. I never am one to complain about decore or seating, if you are giving me good food, I will sit on a stump, so the plastic chairs do not bother me. I would say give it a try...."}
{"text":"I'll start this by saying I have a very picky paler and VERY high standards of food, presentation, service, enraged, attitudes, and experience. I observe everything and am easily turned off by lack of love towards employees, food, or people. This place is about an hour away from me and hard to get to due to my work schedule clashing with their opening hours. I am always short on free time but always make sure I can eat here whenever I have the slightest time to spare. I would drive four hours to eat here as it is my favorite place to be in the entire world. The atmosphere is calm, slithering, accepting, vintage, beautiful, romantic, playful, wonderful. Along with a happy staff who has been working for years here and know your name by heart every time you come back. They have memorized what I like to eat as well! The owner is fantastic and makes sure to ask EVERY person how their meal and experience is-even when every table is filled. The food is made with pure love and joy. No other place on earth could capture the precious feeling of home this restaurant gives me. This is where I come to enjoy a memory and meal with the closest people in my life as I share it with those who I feel truly deserve a taste of my secret magical world. This place is where j come to eat before a flight out of state I case it's my last meal. This place is where I come to run and hide from the mess of my world. And I always leave feeling like tomorrow can be better because my spaghetti said so. I will never stop coming here. It has a piece of my heart and always will. If the owner sees this, please know how much your restaurant means to me and how it makes me feel. Thank you so much for giving me a safe haven."}
{"text":"Everybody who thinks about coming here should go to the real Giuseppe's, in Scottsdale.

I grew up eating at this location pretty much my whole life. So many great memories of the spot but unfortunately the change in ownership left this place with shoddy food. 

Everyone who rates this place above a two, please do yourselves a favor and try the location in Scottsdale (13610 N Scottsdale Rd). The difference is stark."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Phoenix for the night and were deciding where to go and eat. With my pregnancy cravings that sometimes makes it difficult. We were at our hotel when an episode of Food Network's \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\" came on featuring Giuseppe's on 28th (its really located on Indian School.\" The restaurant is small (seats about 20 max) and is decorated with different art and also pictures from the DDD Food Network episode. The waiter greeted us promptly and even the chef himself came out to check on tables and make sure things were running smoothly. I ordered their lobster ravioli with sage and brown butter and my husband ordered classic fettuccine and meatballs with homemade pasta. I can't begin to explain the lobster ravioli accept to say that I have eaten Italian food, ravioli in particular all over the country.  This is hands down THE BEST I have ever had. The restaurant offers several different types of ravioli but if you are a lobster fan this is a must try! My husbands dish was equally delicious, there is truly nothing like homemade pasta. Tucked away in a small strip mall this restaurant may be easily missed but do yourself a favor and turn on your GPS so you don't miss it."}
{"text":"This restaurant proudly shows that they've been featured in Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  I'm not sure why.  My friend Sage, John and I went here one night and had pasta. I had the Linguine with white sauce. John just ordered the Lentil soup and some beers and Sage had some chicken dish. It was a little dissapointing because they don't offer complimentary breads like most italian places.  The portion wasn't very big either. I was hoping to share my pasta with my friends, but I was really hungry. I would expect small portions in posh places, but not from a \"DIVE\". 
I really want to give them high marks and I'm being generous with 3 stars, but for the amount of money that we paid. We could have had a better dinner at Oregano's. Sad, but true."}
{"text":"Oh this place is wonderful. I feel this way because I am an awful cook but I love eating at home. That said, I am notorious for bringing food home and dishing it out on plates and having a go at it like that.

Well, this is like that, only it's someone else's kitchen. Nothing impressive at all, it's even mildly questionable at times, but the food is so darn good. Bringing the wine and cracking it open, sitting in the plastic bistro chairs, flip flops and a tshirt... eating 4 star italian food. It's really awesome. I've ended a relationship here, and it was the most comfortable public breakup I've ever experienced. Try the gnocchi."}
{"text":"Pasta Bolognese was good. Pasta Fagoli was really tasty. I like my wine free with yelp one glass , can't imagine any ever thinking they have unlimited wine as suggested by another reviewer.

 I enjoyed my meal. Service was great and friendly. 

Yummy small authentic Italian restaurant  not a chain. The pasta was fresh and marinara was old school good."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Found this place on IDine and it was featured on triple D with guy. Small but have both in and outside tables."}
{"text":"We arrived last Friday at 4:30 anticipating a crowd after seeing Check Please Arizona reviews.  We were informed they open at 5PM.  We waited outside and noticed a guest sign in form which we assumed we would be called in order at 5pm.  That was not the case.  Quite a few had shown up and also put names on the list.  Just before 5pm they let the whole heard of people in at the same time. The restaurant is very small and all tables filled up quickly.  There initially was only ONE waitress for about 10 minutes then another started taking drink orders.  We almost walked out as they clearly did not prepare the way they should have.  Anyway, long story short....I got the Veal Meatloaf.  Very disappointing for $16.  Overpriced and lacking flavor.   There was nothing memorable about it and even part of the top was hard and overcooked.  My wife however absolutely loved her entrée.  I don't know the name of it but it had black noodles, shrimp, mussels, squid (I think) and not sure what else.  In fairness, I will go back again as there are several things on the menu I would like to try. I just don't understand the guest sign in log and would certainly not recommend the Veal Meatloaf.  We did briefly talk to the table next to us and they seemed pleased with the entrees they had.  I say go give it a try!"}
{"text":"Richard never disappoints. The food is always amazing. The wine perfecto.. And the service great. What's not to like."}
{"text":"So good, lemon chicken is amazing! My friend ordered something \"off menu\"....everything was so good! Friendly staff and owner...I love supporting small businesses! They actually have pictures of their \"extended family\" (customers who have been going there for years) in the restaurant. Go here! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"And only because i have good memories of this place.  The food and service keeps going down hill.  My chick parm was microwaved and rubbery last night.  Can't tell if he still making homemade pasta if he is he doing something different and its not in a good thing.  Better Italian places that haven't lost the passion in the area now"}
{"text":"We enjoyed an excellent meal while on vacation in Phoenix. We ordered tortellini, spaghetti and meatballs, Mac and cheese, and butternut squash ravioli. Everyone enjoyed their entree!  I'm happy we took a chance to check out this Diners, Drive-ins and Dives hot spot. Yum!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place, however, I do think they are a tad on the expensive side, seeing as though they are in a strip mall next to a water store... food is good but pricy."}
{"text":"Let me just say the food is awesome!  Unfortunately, that's not always enough.  This is a ridiculously small restaurant. If you are more than a party of two, be prepared to be cramped!  And if you are a party of two, you might find yourself in a hallway.  If you are looking for a refill on your soft drink, be prepared to pay for it as it is served in cans for which you will be charged 2.25 per can!  If you decide to share a plate with someone (including a child), be prepared to pay $2.00 for the extra plate.  If the server asks if you'd like bread, be prepared to pay for it.  If she brings you more, know that it will be on your bill.  You WILL be nickeled and dimed to death on top of the $15-$18 per plate that you spend on a relatively small portion size on most dishes."}
{"text":"Could not wait to try here after watching on youtube the DDD episode featuring Giuseppe's and have a mixed opinion of the place now that I've finally made it there. The appearance is as described. The place is tiny and the ambiance leaves much to be desired- especially for the type of food prices advertised. This place is a casual eatery with prices/attempts to try to be a gormet restaurant; falling somewhat short.

My wife and I started with the Bruchetta, the bread was nothing to write home about but the toppings were quite tasty and it was well done. She then had the pasta e fagioli soup, which was not quite what we were expecting.  Everywhere else we had had this type of soup, the soup has a more rustic taste, perhaps some meat, a little cheese. This soup tasted like white beans and had no other depth to the flavor. 

She had the lasagna and I the house specialty, a pasta with meat sauce. Her lasagna was very rich but the tomato sauce it was served with tasted as though it came from a can which was certainly very disappointing. My pasta was flavorful but again, nothing special. We had the cream brulee for desert which was tasty to me but again was nothing to write home about. For the prices, this restaurant was certainly not worth it.

To add to this restaurant's troubles, the facility can not handle their own limited business. We were offered garlic bread with our meal (which never actually came but was initially on the bill until I noticed it). The table next to us, had the wrong appetizer come out initially and also had one of the main courses come out with the entree. There was only one server who seemed at times overwhelmed with the degree of business at the restaurant. What did not help is there was a time where she literally stood near the kitchen speaking with the manager for about 10 minutes without moving while customers were waiting to be served, or in my case waiting to pay so we could leave.

If I do return, which is far from guaranteed, will be just for their signature dish(es) & will likely be as take out. In summary, the food was fair, but not worth the prices and the ambiance and service left much to be desired."}
{"text":"wow

such Italian

very diner

I wandered into Giuseppe's on a Friday evening when, after a highly productive day, I was in the grip of the sort of letdown where one feels acutely aware of one's own mortality and the fragility of the word, a mood that requires a polysyllabic German word, so I'm going to give it one: Weltgrunegotterdammerung.

My original plan was to try out the Angry Crab, but the shrieks of the happy hour revelers could be heard halfway down the arcade of the shopping plaza, and being surrounded by \"young professionals\" getting wasted on bloody marys is not a cure for Weltgrunegotterdammerung.

Giuseppe's is a price notch upward (blackboard basic entrees are ~$11 and menu fancy entrees are in mostly in the mid/high teens) but comes with peace, quiet, and a sense of participating in that uniquely American institution: the fine-ish dining hole-in-the-wall in a strip mall. Plus you can combine watching the sun set behind the palm trees with pretending you're in Rome in the 1950s, and any moment now, Audrey Hepburn is going to pull up on a Vespa.

The point of the bread is to mop up the excess pasta sauce, as it's happy sponge-y bread rather than bread that one eats on its own and then spends three years trying to reproduce at home with dutch ovens and spritzers. I consumed an insane amount of it while sponging up the butter/oil-type sauce from the shrimp ravioli because it was the sort of sauce that one is required to sponge, if not to actually lick the plate. If a little splashes or spills in the sponging process, it probably does excellent things for soft, younger-looking skin, too.

The shrimp ravioli contained an identifiable shrimp! I've never before encountered anything that wasn't a mash in a seafood rav anywhere, nor a sauce that contained spices rather than being all alfredo-esque. The rav were very nice, with some crab and some ricotta -- just rich enough to feel reasonably content with the quantity, but not taking it to the point where one wonders what one just did. I'm actually relieved not to have fallen madly in love with them -- sorry, shrimp rav, it was just a fling, as there are many other tempting items on the menu. Boar ragu!

True love -- or at least strong animal passion -- is elicited by the white-chocolate creme brulee. Dante would have written several volumes in verse to the white-chocolate creme brulee.

I'm reviewing it partly so it can be added to the \"kind to lone diners\" list, as the staff were absolute sweethearts. They were clearly trying to hit the right pace where I could enjoy a leisurely meal without feeling neglected (or, conversely, be promptly attended to without feeling rushed) -- and since I myself didn't really know what mood I was in (Weltgrunegotterdammerung will do that for a girl), that was a bit of a challenge. I strongly suspect that this is the sort of place where, if you go regularly, they remember you and see that things are as you like them."}
{"text":"Hallelujah! This is the type of Italian I have been looking for. It's almost like sitting in  a kitchen.
Small place, maybe 10 tables, plastic chairs, paper table coverings, menu written in chalk on boards in front. Fresh pasta on Fridays and BYOB with a $3 cork fee. Hot damn! I got the lobster ravioli (holy garlic it was good). Also tried the mozzarella so fresh and spongy, drizzled in evoo and balsamic... Yum.. Had to try the tiramisu disappointed by the small portion but little miss piggy had eaten enough so it was probably a good thing. If you don't like this place go to Olive Garden, it may be better suited for your taste duds."}
{"text":"STAY FAR AWAY FROM HERE. I would give negative stars if i could! I have never been so disrespected in my life by the people here. Don't come unless you enjoy being disrespected and publicly humiliated.

I used to eat here all the time... never again will i give them my business."}
{"text":"The food here is decent but certainly not worth dealing with the very condescending owner. I'd much rather take my money to a place that appreciates their customers."}
{"text":"Italian owned, so you'd think they could make some authentic dishes. Not impressed."}
{"text":"This place has the best Italian food in Arizona. I love all of their pastas, but my favorite is the lemoncello one. Their eggplant is also to die for....paper thin, the way it's supposed to be."}
{"text":"Not my first nor my last visit here. 
I love it here.
Not only is the food the best Italian.... but the service is second to none. 
Thank you Cindy for always making my visit great! 
If you want authentic Italian food and great service.... you need to be here."}
{"text":"We went this plan with dear couple from Boston; they found this restaurant on Food.net. The food and desserts are great and the service is outstanding. We all joyed eating there and definitely will tell other people and come back again!"}
{"text":"After three visits I am hooked! Great little place. I tried this place because of a local dines deal and now keep going back. Two time everything was 100% perfect. This last time the bread on my meatball sub was just a little hard, actually really hard but the meatballs are so good that I overlooked it! I have had the lasagna which was very flavorful and lots of cheese and sauce. The appetizers are great as well as the pasta fagiolli. The canolli is a great choice for dessert. Service is always friendly and fast. Food hot and fresh. The place is small but worth the wait. The owner was asking everyone how their meals were. Nice to see him involved and taking care of customers."}
{"text":"Great little get-a-away from the strip mexican food. It was recomended by a valet guy and it was great."}
{"text":"We just experienced the best meal at Giuseppe's on 28th. Veal Osso Buco and Lemon Risotto with Shrimp was to die for! You have try try the Burrata!!"}
{"text":"I had a hard time finding this restaurant to review it because at first I thought it was called As Seen on Food Network....but I found it so on with the review. My wife first introduced me to this place by bringing it home one night for dinner. It was horrible; but I chalked this up to what I ordered (a dish that was a cross between Mexican and Italian food) and the fact that it was cold from the drive home. So when we were in the area we decided to go in and sit down for a meal and enjoy the atmosphere. Well enjoy I did...nothing says a nice night out to dinner like tables covered with paper and plastic cups for you can drink (don't adjust your screen; this is not a review for Peter Piper Pizza). But hey, I am not a snob; I love places that save on the little things so they can put it in the food. But sadly this was not the case; it was not the worst Italian I have ever had, I am old enough to remember Wendy's super bar with fettuccine alfredo and hamburger bun bottoms cut in half and slathered in garlic butter. But for the price and the hype it was strike two; I had a Caesar salad and a pasta in cream sauce; both decent portions but nothing to write home about in the end. The service was poor, we did not get the specials but luckily we heard it given to the table beside us (just not lucky enough to have this happen before we ordered). We also ordered bread with our entrees but it never came out. I think my wife summed up our service experience best when she said that at the very least she expected the waiter to pour her can Coke into her plastic cup for her. The bill came and I found myself paying top dollar for mediocre food and poor service; strike three, ball game."}
{"text":"I suck. I've been going to this strip mall for many, many years and always thought \"I need to check that place out\".   I finally went and it was so simple and good I be a regular form now on I promise.

Had the brochettes, all were very good. Not \"oh my f'ing God\" good but yet very solid.  The lentil soup was fresh and full of vegetables.

I had the bolonanase (sp?) ragu.  Past with meat sauce but oh so much more when it came to the taste.  I cleaned my plate.

Keep in mind this place is BYOB. You sit on plastic chairs. and there are only about 8 tables in this tiny strip mall location.

Nice."}
{"text":"Yes, the on the food network sign is incredibly tacky but the food is better than most Italian places. Actually we found it hit or miss. My wife loved the gazpacho soup, I thought the house salad was so so, the garlic bread wasn't very good but our main courses were pretty good. I had the spaghetti and had a couple of meatballs. I thought the meatballs were extremely well done. The service was attentive, they had to be because the water and iced tea glasses were only like 6 oz glasses so they had to come by and constantly refill them."}
{"text":"The calamari had no flavor at all. The veal oso buco also had no flavor. The veal meatloaf was alright the fresh pasta and garlic bread were good. But overall a waste of money."}
{"text":"Despite the gaudy \"AS SEEN ON FOOD NETWORK\" sign, the food lives up to its reputation. After returning from a holiday in Italy, we craved genuine carbonara (which, if you don't know, is not cream based but made with egg and Parmesan). After hunting high and low, and eating countless disappointments, we called Guiseppe's before making the drive to ask how they prepare theirs. When Richard said \"of course it has egg\" like we were dolts for even asking, we knew we had to go. And sure enough, it's the best we've had since returning to the US. I kid you not, my wife teared up on the first bite out of sheer joy at the authentic taste. Richard is the owner and operator, and like a lot of New Yorkers is friendly once you break the ice.

We haven't tried any entrées other than the carbonara (with homemade pasta), but have been back several times just for it. On one occasion we had a nice mozzarella spinach antipasto. And after hearing another table rave about the tiramisu, we ordered a slice and were elated by it. Suddenly, the woman who contemplated licking the dish clean didn't seem so unreasonable.

Why four stars instead of five? Well you can always expect a wait at this 28-seat restaurant, and the service is friendly but distracted."}
{"text":"So, I always leave Giuseppe's stuffed full of rich Italian goodness, but my wallet sure suffers. The reason we don't frequent this neighborhood dive i because you get so little for such a high price. The food is high quality. The portions are tiny. The menu item that annoys me the most is the ravioli...you get about 6 little raviolis and are expected to make a meal of it. 

And I heard a rumor that they're raising their prices because they were just featured on the Food Network. 

How do you say \"Sellout\" in Italian?"}
{"text":"So I finally made it here after seeing it years ago on DD&D, since I was in the area.  I had the spaghetti bolognese, signature dish, and yes, it was very good.  Disappointed in the chicken parmigiana however, and the accompanying pasta marinara.  The homemade tagliatelle is excellent, but the marinara sauce was way too acidic for us.  Is it me tho, or does anyone else find the portions extremely small?  At first I thought it was decently priced, then when I saw the plate with barely anything on it, I felt ripped off.  I could have eaten twice the amount of pasta and I don't eat much pasta typically.  Maybe that's a testimonial of how good it was, but I see it as a sign of how small it was.  Also, the place is very small to the point of being uncomfortable, as your conversation can be heard in almost the whole restaurant.  I don't think I'll be back, even though the menu was very appealing to me."}
{"text":"I have to agree with a lot of the reviews in the sense that the atmosphere could use some work.  New tables and chairs, maybe a remodel in the near future?  But besides all that, the food IS that good.  The best Marinara sauce I have had in a long time hands down.  Plus the Cappuccinos after dinner were delicious!  I would recommend at least checking it out.  The eggplant parmesan is superb!"}
{"text":"Went here for an outing with six other friends. I do not recommend this since the place is small and quaint, however, we were very lucky and scored tables pushed together right away.

The garlic bread was deliciously heavy on the garlic and butter. Despite being drenched, it's texture was surprisingly still crisp on the outside and soft in the inside. (You order by the basket for $4, otherwise, you get regular bread which is meh).

The baked ziti was perfect. The penne pasta was perfectly cooked. The ricotta cheese was nicely proportionally mixed in with the pasta and sauce. Its a simple dish, yet satisfying.

The tiramisu was also mouthwateringly delicious. Its consistency was very mousse-like  making it basically melt in your mouth after every bite."}
{"text":"Kind of arrogant service. They are still touting Diners Drive ins and Dives, that was a decade ago, give it a rest. The food was fair at best and they charge for a better meal than they deliver. I'll look elsewhere for italian next time."}
{"text":"My office ordered take-out and I had the sausage sandwich... I'll probably die with a sausage sandwich in hand. 

I wasn't really pleased with my order; I guess that I had some build-up because this place has been on TV.  I totally understand it's hard to judge a restaurant from ordering take-out so I'll probably try this place again and have my meal there."}
{"text":"My wife heard about this restaurant from people she met in a restaurant in New Jersey. They had heard about it from tv and said their Italian food was wonderful. Of course we love a place like Pizzeria Bianco or Cibo, but have been looking for something a little less pricey. We absolutely loved our meal. We both had pasta dishes and their pasta was fresh and out of this world. Both of our sauces were also amazing, and the meatballs that went with my dish were the best I have had in years.  We had a lovely antipasto but weren't overly impressed with the bread. Our waiter, Patrick, was very knowledgeable and made a recommendation to me that helped to make my meal very special. My comment to him after our meal was, \"You are the man!\" On the negative side, the meal was still a tad pricey, but was absolutely worth it. We will definitely go back and are excited to try some of their other pasta dishes."}
{"text":"Dined here for my graduation dinner! It reminds me of the food my moms friend (a wonderful Italian woman) used to make. Makes me wish I lived here!"}
{"text":"It seems like I find myself in Phoenix for business more than any other city.  After seeing Giuseppe's featured on Triple-D I decided to take a colleague there for lunch.

As another reviewer noted, there are pictures and signs and placards and flyers galore of Guy Fieri.  It's a little funny and off putting at the same time.

My colleague had the sausage and pepper sandwich and I had the bolognese.  Both were excellent and both were pricey ($40 for the two of us including tip).

I definitely want to try other things on their menu like the chicken or eggplant parm but maybe I'll make him pick up the tab next time.  Hahaha...J/K Joe!

Great food, but just because it's on Triple-D, don't expect it to be cheap."}
{"text":"In a town seriously lacking in good Italian food this place is as close as it is going to get.  The food is decent, the ambiance straight out of Jersey, and the service attentive.  Is it the end all be all?  No, but it is a nice little oasis in this desert city."}
{"text":"When I was a kid I would eat a pile of plain noodles with butter on them while the rest of my family mowed down on real Italian food. I think it had more to do with the fact that spaghetti given to a kiddo is more likely to end up on them than in them, and tomato sauce hurts when it ends up in your eye. But in twenty-odd years my palate has matured past the realm of bland noodles and into the realm of big girl flavors. I think that's why I was so disappointed by Giuseppe's. 

I ordered the smoked salmon with asparagus pasta, thinking, \"Heck yeah, lox me up and throw away the key!\" Instead, I got the toddler special in disguise, a big pile of noodles drowning in butter, with flakes of salmon and asparagus floating throughout. Ewwie. The noodles were freshly prepared since it was the weekend and were a doughy delight. It's too bad they were marred by such a crap combination. I mean, you can't even toss in some garlic, onions or something vaguely resembling seasoning? Failure, failure, failure.

My boyfriend's pasta carbonara was a thing of beauty. It is very difficult to find real carbonara in the valley. Most places just toss together white sauce and bacon and call it a night. Very few take the time to saute onions, garlic and pancetta, add steaming hot pasta, raw egg and parmesan cheese and toss until it oozes together into drool inducing blob of yum. Amazing good. 

It's just odd that such contradictory dishes are on the same menu. 

We also had the garlic bread, because what better to add to a giant pile of carbs than more bread? It was passable. Very dry and crispy, more like crouton, and topped with a delish garlicky spice infused oil. Four tiny toastettes for four bucks though. Not the greatest deal. 

I shall be back. I'll just stay far, far away from the noodly combos of questionable origin. 

P.S.  To all my winos out there-- corking fee of 4 bucks!"}
{"text":"So I'm here eating some of the best Italian I have ever had... it's 2 minutes before closing...  a couple walks in and they are immediately seated!!  2 minutes before closing and still get not only great service, but great food!  My first time here, but not my last!!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch the other day and it was great. I had the chicken parmesean sandwich. The sauce was good, the service was good and I like the small store front location. The red and white table cloths go a long way. It is BYOB so bring your own wine and enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is a local gem!  We had date night and were recommended this place from some good friends.  Small and quaint with patio seating .  Greeted with smiles and prompt service.   I chose the eggplant Parmesan with fresh home made pasta and my husband had the Spaghetti with home made meatballs.  Absolutely delicious!  Fresh pasta was fantastic.   It seems the owner Rich makes a point to greet every table and is charismatic and warm.  Very well done and we will return!  We had a great Experience!"}
{"text":"Totally awesome experience. We decided to celebrate our anniversary here and it was a great choice. Yes, the restaurant is small, but that really doesn't matter as all one needs is one table to seat four people. The waiter was full of helpful hints and suggestions as this was our first visit here. After deciding on a bottle of Chianti, we began with a plate of calamari and a side of garlic bread, hmmmm, yummy. Then we all had different main courses--butternut squash ravioli, spaghetti neri, penne al Santa Fe, and penne al salmone. However, two of us switched to the house fresh pasta, which was awesome. If you have only experienced store-bought pasta then you may not be prepared for the wholesome goodness of true homemade pasta. The flavor of each dish was wonderful. We then indulged in dessert. The creme brulee and key lime tart both were excellent (although we were all stuffed by then). The portions were just right and the whole dining experience was awesome."}
{"text":"It was our last night in Phoenix, and we had a nice dinner at Elements, so my wife wanted to eat at another Diners, Drive In's, and Dive's restaurant.  With Italian blood running through her veins, she wanted Italian and already had decided she needed to have authentic tiramisu.  We did, and I a cannoli, which was good, as was the cappuccino.  We also had the melon and prosciutto.  A quaint place, popular and fun.  They pride themselves for being on Triple D, and rightly so.  Nice place."}
{"text":"Overrated wasn't happy with my meal. Plus I felt rushed to eat & get out of their. This place is very small and hot."}
{"text":"Great Italian food-  nothing fancy - basic and classic, but still great.  Tiny (10-12 tables) and cozy.  Service was great too.  This was a real find from Check Please Arizona (on PBS).  We will be regulars even though we live in Surprise."}
{"text":"The paso buco was excellent. The service was friendly and efficient. A bit pricy, but the serving size was very good; two of us happily fed. Must mention the great sauce, rich and perfectly seasoned. We started with a Giuseppe salad, which was also large and satisfying. Strong recommendation ."}
{"text":"What a perfect, friendly, tasty meal we had there last night!  The absolute quintessential italian neighborhood kind of place - a little kitchy, a lot tasty, and an inviting staff and warm and friendly owner.   Butternut Squash Ravioli in a brown butter sauce (one of the limited rotating specials) was perfect, and the very large portion of lasagna (at just $13.5) was almost as good as mom's :).  Smallish, quaint, a touch of cheese on the billboard (\"As seen on TV\") make it a perfect spot for a quiet romantic dinner as well as a group of 6-8.  Larger groups may be challenged as I don't *think* they take reservations - but check on that ...."}
{"text":"My husband and I saw Giuseppe'son Guy Fieri's show,
Food was aaaaaahhhhhuuuummmm fantastic I had the lobster ravioli wanted more.. husband had lasagna, wish we could have tried more dishes, maybe next trip to Phoenix... WE WILL recommend it. our server was Tony very nice."}
{"text":"Dined here Monday night.  Great authentic homemade food!  We all loved the salad and our entrees.  DEFINIITELY get the Butternut Squash Ravioli's...do die for.

Great find and looking forward to going back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Giuseppe's on 28th for over 10 years when it was first a BYOB. But, we love the fact that they now offer a wonderful wine list and Italian beer. The owner is always in the restaurant and there to offer you special dishes or suggestions when it comes to wine. It is authentic Italian food as he learned to cook in Florence. Just love this place!!! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Should have listened to the numerous negative reviews on-line (and there were many) but we trusted Guy from Diners, Drivins & Dives ...BIG MISTAKE. 

Clue #1 Strip mall with huge cheesy banner boasting \"Food Network\" endorsement. Clue #2  Self serves sign-in waiting list, apparently, the slimy owner was too busy gushing over customers trying to eat but steering clear of unhappy ones.  Misters and drinking water would have been a nice touch to make the 10-20min 104 degree wait more bearable. 

The minute we saw the paper table cloths and plastic chairs,cups & utensils we were in trouble. One waiter frantically tried to service the whole restaurant, which was a complete zoo. Now according to Triple D, the pasta was homemade....aaaaaah.....not so much.... Ive been to Italy, I know the difference.  

Cut to the chase, $27.00 for two a la carte / appetizer sized entrees.

Seems to me, his only goal is cashing in on the TV appearance as quickly as possible with no concern to repeat business...

Don't waste your time and money....On a positive note, Guy was right about Matts Big Breakfast in downtown Phoenix, great good and the best costumer service we've ever had."}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow! Giuseppe's on 28th isn't fancy looking but the food is absolutely wonderful. The place is small and so they clearly have high quality control because everything was off the charts delicious. The sign out front about being on the Food Network is a bit corny, but don't let that stop you - this is the real deal.

We started the evening with the squid in white wine and one taste had me thinking about building a shrine to its greatness. The squid was so fresh and tender, the tomato sauce had a deep richness and sharp spice, and the peas (courtesy of Tuscany) were a stroke of regional genius. You'll never eat fried squid again - this is the only way to go. We ordered the garlic bread to sop up every drop of tomato sauce.

We tried the bruscetta which is prepared on the most wonderful bread you will ever taste. My wife said it is from Willo? I'm not sure ,but I was thinking maybe heaven? You get 4 different slices - the one with prosciutto, fig and goat cheese was magnificent.Then the dinner. You must try the \"as seen on the Food Network\" Osso Buco. Oh my God - this was the best meal I've had in a long, long time. Parked on a bed of home made noodles was the most extraordinary marinated meat with a complex tomato-based sauce that could bring Michaelangelo back from the dead to declare his entire lifes' work a failure in comparison to this work of culinary art. Savor the beauty. My wife had the manicotti, which because of the fine tomato sauce and fresh noodles, was excellent.

We finished the meal with tiramisu. After one taste I laughed out loud at anyone that would give this place a negative review. That would be the definition of a shill. Giuseppe's on 28th is not the fanciest, but it is the best Tuscan-Italian food you will eat in Phoenix. Delizioso! We also thought it was pretty cool that the owner walks around and makes sure everything is perfect. It was!"}
{"text":"We're Triple D junkies and usually check for any restaurants Guy has featured when we vacation.  On a recent trip back to my hometown of Phoenix we tried it.  We like hole in the wall places and enjoyed the size and low-key approach taken.  The wait staff was great and the owner mingled.  The food was good, not great.  Thought the prices were fine and the portions certainly enough unless you feel cheated without leftovers.  We ordered the rice balls for appetizers (o.k.), pasta e fagioli
soup (good), gnocchi in tomato sauce (good but heavy), pork osso buco
(good) and the bolognese ragu ( o.k., not enough sauce and the various meats were indistinguishable.)  Enjoyed the meal but wouldn't make it a must go to stop on my next visit."}
{"text":"I don't understand why anyone likes this place.  I ordered the fresh pasta and found it heavy and tasteless.   It is also very expensive considering for what I paid here I can dine in much better places.  I find the Food Network sign on the outside a little tasteless also."}
{"text":"My Kind of Place!!  Nothing snobby or fancy, just great homemade italian food!  We didn't know that the restaurant closed at 9 PM, so at about 9:20 PM we walked in on saturday night to a packed restaurant.  I asked the owner if they were closed, he told us to hold on while he checked with the kitchen... a minute later he had us seated... we were very grateful!  I moved to AZ about 5 years ago from NJ, where in my opinion some of the best italian food is...I have not found a good italian restaurant in AZ until now... I ordered an osso bucco that sat on top of homemade pasta.  OMG, so good, It was a very generous portion and the meat separated from the bone with a fork.. delicious and $19.. How can you beat that?  Osso bucco, whether beef, pork or lamb anywhere else will cost you at least $30... We also ordered a calamari appetizer that was swimming in a tasty gravy which we dipped garlic bread in... the gravy was extra tasty as well.. My partner ordered a bolognese sauce over home made noodles... the bolognese had 6-7 cured meat in it, which made for a nice meaty flavor... could have used more garlic but was nonetheless delicious.  We were too full to try any desserts but the tiramisu looked great and I will definitely be back to try that.  The owner made it a point to come over and have a conversation with us.  He is from NY and takes pride in the food they make.  Some other reviews have commented that the food network sign they have in front is a little much... perhaps, but they are a small business and I don't think there is anything wrong in taking advantage of the fact that they are good enough to be featured on that network.  I would have never found this gem if it weren't for seeing it on the show... Thanks again, and I can't wait to be back!!"}
{"text":"Great Li%me Italian place with great Italian food!    I had the best and gorgonzola penne Ross's which came out a beautiful blush pink color.   It was an interesting combination bit worked well together.   Pasta was cooked aldente perfect and the sauce had just a hint of the gorgonzola so not to overwhelm the dish.  The usual baked ziti and chicken Alfredo were also or see red and immensely enjoyed.    You can smell the goodne$ of the home cooked Italian maranera sauce as soon as u enter the small dining area where you quickly greeted by the owner and sharing stories with him like an old friend.   We will definitely come back and enjoy this place.   The only reason this is not 5 stars is that we had to wait too long for our food so plan plenty of time for your visit.   They had a huge wine selection as well as a nice in house made deserts.   Tiramisu was so light and fluffy with generous portions it was the perfect follow up to our dinner.     Giuseppe I'm glad you stopped playing the cello to open this restaurant.    You are making beautiful music at the restaurant now."}
{"text":"Excellent eggplant parm!  Next time I'll try the meatballs."}
{"text":"It is the one place I MUST go to whenever I'm I'm Phoenix...no, in the southwest! My favorite Italian restaurant, Bolognese Ragu is a must."}
{"text":"Our party had chicken parmesan, baked ziti, pork special and a bottle of Pino Grigio.  Servers were nice but the food was just average.  The typical pasta dishes were reasonably priced but the specials seemed spendy and our bottle of wine was $32.  Not sure I'd go again."}
{"text":"I'v been to Giuseppe's a couple times, and the food is very reasonably priced considering its quality and authenticity.  Giuseppe is a \"hands on\" restaurateur and definitely knows his wine as well as his Italian.

Everything here is amazing - in particular the Veal Osso Buco and the Squid Ink pasta - but you won't go wrong no matter what you choose.  This place also has the best Tiramisu I've ever tried.  

Already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food. I had the Bolognese Ragu...yummm!  Last week I had the Osso Bucco...delish!...Homemade pasta too! Then, for dessert I had  terramisu.. This place is highly recommended. This place is small so be ready to wait a while to be seated..if they are busy"}
{"text":"To start, the clams were great with the garlic bread. You have to get the bread to sop up all the sauce. Then for the main course the homemade pasta was memorable and very delicious. My only wish was that they would roll the pasta thinner so it's not as overwhelming for each bite. 

It's definitely some good Italian and I wish it was closer to home. 

Owner was very engaged and remembered many of the guests by name. Even us as first timers after we introduced ourselves."}
{"text":"I love this place! Had a great red blend wine with our meals. The bruschetta was crispy and rich in flavor. I got soup that tasted fresh and simple. 

Our main dishes were out of control. I ordered the penne pasta with the Gorgonzola cream sauce, sausage and sugar beets. My friends got seafood risotto and the bolognese ragu. All amazing! We shared and practically licked our plates clean. 

Our server was friendly and attentive. It's a very clean establishment. We sat outside on a nice night and their patio is so cute. 

It's definitely a neighborhood secret since it's small and in a shopping center. So happy my friends boyfriend grew up around here, so he suggested the place."}
{"text":"By far the best Italian food I have ever had. Everything is homemade and you can tell that the food is high quality. Don't let the strip mall fool you, this place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Love this place. My fiancé and I have gone here for anniversaries and other special nights. Great service and outstanding food quality. Bruschetta is amazing and tiramisu is fantastic. Owner is a great guy and worth your business. Take your date here."}
{"text":"I went to Giuseppe's last night to use a daily deal I had bought awhile back. This place definitely had some positives and has the potential to be a four star place, but there were a few things that brought it down for me. I will start with the positive: the gnocchi was good, and the recommendation to add asparagus was spot on, the marinara was also pretty good and the bf liked his chicken parm. On to the negative: our server was very nice, but he disappeared for about 15 minutes while we were waiting for the check. When he returned, he said he had to answer the phones but he smelled like he had been taking a smoke break...not cool. We got their rice balls for an app and they were less than stellar....kind of soggy, not crispy like other arancini. Overall, the food was tasty and if the service was a little better, i could see giving 4 stars, but for now it is just ok, but I would give it another chance in the future."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend last night and we absolutely loved it. It was nice and quiet so perfect for a date night. The waitstaff was awesome and made sure we were taken care of. The food was perfect! Calamari was so good. Then I got the shrimp ravioli and he got the baked ziti. We loved all of it! I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"My family stumbled upon this gem by accident. Couldn't have been happier. 7 meat bolognas and seafood nece was to die for. Would recommend to anyone and the prices are very fair"}
{"text":"Some of the bad things at Guseppe were mainly the service and drinks. We had reservations for 6 at 6:00 and they tried to sit us down with 4 chairs. We told them there was 6 and they asked us to sit outside while we get the table ready. When the rest of the party got here 10 minutes later they still hadn't finished setting the table so as we were sitting down we had a server setting drinks right over our heads. When I ordered Dr.Pepper it took at least 10 minutes for it to come out ,but the worst of all was that it was super watered down. When all the drinks finally came out my mom's champagne had no bubbles! Our server was very nice but she didn't come by often and she asked for the wine list so she could see what was on it. They also had a really small place and bathroom. The color scheme or design wasn't pretty. When she came to get the check she took it but then came back to ask where our card was. She asked did you put it on the top and we kindly told her it was in the card slot. She didn't think to look there which wouldn't look good on the restaurant. Some of the really good things were the food. All the food was amazing. The music was nice and the owner would stop by and ask us how our day was and just other conversation topics. I would recommend going there for the food but if you are in a rush then you shouldn't go because of the service."}
{"text":"Best Authentic Italian food and home-made pasta so far. The owner and staff were awesome! They catered to us, as if we bought the whole place out and were the only customers. Everything was so goood!!! I shall return  t"}
{"text":"Thanks for the great dinner Rich.

I've eaten at this location dating back nearly 20 years.
Rich took over in 2002 and it only got better.

Now they have beer / wine and a credit card machine!

Great Rapini tonight.

{"text":"Had the Oso Buco this time. Very tasty, the veal was just a bit tough  but overall an excellent meal"}
{"text":"Luca swims wit da marinara...............Hey! Buono! Moto Buono!
You have got to get into the Lincoln or Cadi and get over to G's on 28th.  This is the kinda place you find in New York (yes Irene I have been And lived there so fughedaboudid!!!).  Its real small, the people are very kind but curt and will tell you what to do and you will not sit at a table for 4 if you are only a 2 top.  Ok?! Now lets get started.  If you get there when it is not busy you are told to pick your table (remember the rule wise guy!). We declined wine/cocktail or beer, since we (lil ms. longlegs n I) were going to the movies after eating and we did not want to get the tireds n slows.  So we ordered water and ice tea which came in plastic cups (this was why I gave it only 4 stars).  Lil Ms. Longlegs ordered the bruschetta for her main meal (you get to choose which ones you want) I ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana with the homemade pasta.  We thought the bruschetta was adequate (bread was not overly impressive) but the Eggplant was divine.  Sliced thin and very lightly breaded with thin sliced mozzarella and the sauce was very good (a little tame for me but still excellent).  We both thought that for the food and ambiance their pricing was a little on the high side.  We will go back and try some of their other dishes.  This place was on Food Channel which we figured it would be an \"11\" on a scale of 1 to 10.  I give it a 8.2, Ms. L.L. gave it a 9.  Ciao Piasanos."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place but I was mostly disappointed. The bruschetta toppings were good but the bread was not. It seemed like a roll bought at a grocery store. I thought they might bake it there but they do not. The cannoli was pretty good, but the main entree was not, I ordered the penne al salmone. At first I thought, well maybe I don't like more authentic Italian food and that's why I'm not enjoying this. But after leaving the restaurant and my stomach feeling funky I think some of the ingredients weren't good. 

My friend had the lasagna which was ok, but the sauce was not good. It was way too strong/salty."}
{"text":"A little warm inside the restaurant but that's the extent of negativity this review will get. 
I had the baked ziti and added sausage and my wife had the shrimp risotto. We started with a mix of bruschetta and all the food was absolutely delicious. Great \"mom and pop\" feel to the restaurant. This place was visited by Guy Fieri for an episode of Triple D (Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives)  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience! We actually were told about this local gem by a waiter at another restaurant. Then we found out that they had also been featured on one of my favorite shows, Diners and Drive Ins so I figured if it got raves from Guy I couldn't pass up a chance to visit too. From the first friendly hello when you enter the door you are treated as if you are an old friend even if  you're a first time visitor like I was.
  The food is amazing. Homemade pasta is so yummy. Be advised, portions are very generous-so share or be prepared to take home leftovers, which is not a bad thing. Everything from appetizers to deserts can be shared and you will still leave feeling very satisfied and very happy that you have been to Giuseppe's on 28th."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in all of Phoenix.  Each dish is well crafted with delicious and unique flavors.  I had the lasagna tonight, which literally melted in my mouth and was probably the best lasagna I've ever eaten.  I also ate some of the shrimp scampi.  You could tell the noodles were homemade, and I might have literally licked my plate at one point.  The portions are perfectly-sized (not too small where you feel you're paying fancy restaurant prices for a couple of nibbles of food, not too large that you feel like you have to skip out on dessert and are too bloated and need to get rolled out of the restaurant by your waiter).  We had desserts for the first time tonight, and I really enjoyed both the flourless chocolate cake (hot and topped with some excellent ice cream) and the key lime tart.  I was full by the end of the night, but the food was so good that I would have eaten it all over if someone put it in front of me again.  We also met the owner who was incredibly friendly and really loves food - he spent ten years in Florence and knows his stuff!!!

Can't wait to come back again!  Perfect place for a date night."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The food really does taste like you're eating at a Roman Trattoria. It's pretty small on the inside so watch your elbows. Its also in an unassuming location in the middle of a strip mall so keep your eyes out for the big sign that says they've been on The Food Network otherwise you might just drive on by.

Their Spaghetti Carbanara may have been the best I've ever had.  Buon Appetito!"}
{"text":"forget what you know about fine italian dining. the dining at Giuseppe's is neither fine, expensive, or classy. it's a black and white tiled mecca of italian food, nestled comfortably in the same strip mall as a cellular reseller and a blockbuster. go anytime, and order anything. if you see a dude alone at a table getting drunk on red wine, that's the owner. the first time we went we cut him off for a parking spot outside. PARTY FOUL. it's BYOB, so make sure you stop at sprouts next door and get a bottle or five of whatever they have on sale."}
{"text":"Really nice food.  Best eggplant parmigiana I've ever had and we live in San Francisco.  Friendly service too."}
{"text":"I completely agree with Sabrina.  Stick to the red sauces, they seem to be good.  The Bolognese was very good too.  I quite like the eggplant appetizer also.  All in all, very standard in a city full of \"eh\" Italian food.  Way better than anything you'll find at Mac Grill or Olive Garden and it'll cost you less too.

Bonus, Guiseppe's is BYOB with a $3 corkage fee.

Mangia!"}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment. After hearing how it had been recognized on the Food Network, I went there with a friend on a Sunday evening and found the food to be mediocre and overpriced. The waiter also tried desperately to get us to purchase wine and sides. I finally relented to an order of garlic bread, and was served plain, stale bread. For this stale bread, we got charged $3. I will not be going back. If you want Italian, Red Devil is a better deal with a nicer atmosphere and better wait staff.. Oh yeah, the bread is good and complimentary."}
{"text":"Food-frickin-gasm! 

Was on a business trip, had one night in Phoenix, one meal, wanted it to be memorable. Researched heavily on Yelp and Triple D and came down to this one little Italian restaurant.

Work friend and I agreed we had to try the two dishes highlighted on DDD; 5 meat bolognese with homemade pasta and Osso Bucco. First started with a salad with fresh mozzarella, pesto, tomatoes, basil. Wow it was so fresh, so amazing. The waiter suggested we get the bolognese sauce with a special homeade pasta that was filled with ricotta but yet light and airy and smaller than a penne but not hollow. Very unique softness to it and it was just incredible with this meat sauce. 

Second I have to say I would not typically order osso bucco but since it was highlighted on the show as a melt in your mouth good, I couldn't resist. This night it was made with veal shank. This was three huge veal shanks that filled the entire plate with a homeade lingini pasta with ruffled edges like lasagna noodles and this wonderful dark rich tomato/wine flavor sauce that was just amazing by itself. Wow you literally did not have to chew this meat and I am not exaggerating! 

We were just awestruck over the flavors of these dishes, the cozy environment and the amazing friendliness of the restaurant. The owner came over several times to ask us how we liked it and we both were so impressed with the customer service overall.

To top it off, our amazing waiter was nice enough to save us the last caramel gelato with praline pecans crunched up small, OMG so smooth, sweet and perfect! I cannot wait to bring my other work associates here when I come back to Phoenix in a couple of weeks!"}
{"text":"The Italian Mac N Cheese might be the best I've had.  At first, I didn't think it was enough, but ended up being the perfect proportion.  Warm, cheesy, and came in some extra butter that mixed in well."}
{"text":"I try not to throw around 5-stars out like gang signs, because I really want to reserve the primo ratings for places that really knock my socks off. But, Giuseppe's is quite deserving of the highest rating because it really is a gem of a place. 

Voted New Times Best of Phoenix Neighborhood Italian (2003), veal (2004) and BYOB (2005), Giuseppe's certainly has earned such accolades. However, in all fairness, I must say I do not live in the neighborhood nor did I have the veal. But, I'll most definitely be trying the veal. And since I went with Robert M, you should know that BYOB is a given. Well, honestly, since I showed up it's almost certain that I'm carrying some form of alcohol on my person. 

After watching a decidedly emotionally-charged movie at Camelview (The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, an amazing must-see even though a key element in the film is grossly misleading--PM me if you've seen it and I'll share) Robert M and I needed to do something to appreciate the goodness in life so we decided to devirginize ourselves of the Giuseppe's experience. It was about 4:45 p.m. on a Saturday and we were seated immediately. Tucked into a strip mall, it immediately reminded us of the set-up of Pizza A Metro. After reviewing the menu, Robert walked over to Sprouts for wine and we ordered three bruschetta (slow-cooked pork ribs with tomato & melted mozzarella, pesto &fresh tomato and chevre & marinated sun-dried tomatoes) that were all extremely delicious. The bread remained firm and not soggy, yet not so hard that it hurt your teeth or cut the roof of your mouth. We also split the lasagna which was made with fresh pasta and plated with the most divine \"gravy\" [for all the Italians, although I'm Irish] that we've ever tasted. So *smooth* and not bitter or acidic or sweet or anything less than heavenly. If I could bathe in this, I would. But, since I'm not a splosher... :blush: 

If only I wouldn't have eaten so much popcorn in the hour before going to Giuseppe's, I would have indulged in so much more. But, alas, I have found a reason to take this Avenue kid back to the Streets: Giuseppe's."}
{"text":"This was just \"ok\" for me.  I didnt love it.  I really, really wanted to since my aunt/uncle raved about it.  We started with 2 apps.  Calamari and the arrancini.  Both were good.  I had chicken parm and I actually prefer a thinner chicken breast( butterflied).  The breading was soggy, not that light and crispy like I prefer.  The red sauce was just ok.  My uncle makes amazing red sauce that has a great depth of flavor.  This sauce was a little \"tinny\" and lacking for me.  My tummy didnt like it either, I was burping it up all night.   My partner had baked ziti and I actually hated this.  Trying a bite of hers, made me crave my baked ziti.  This baked ziti had a huge lump of ricotta on top( not mixed in).  To me, that is not proper baked ziti.  The pasta wasnt sauced enough either.  

My aunt had eggplant.  cant comment on that since I despise eggplant.  She loved it though.  My uncle had a pasta dish that had brocolli rabe and gemelli pasta.  They subbed out chicken for the sausage so my uncle was happy.  The bread was so/so.  The salad was basic.  The dressing wasnt emulsified ( pool of oil on the bottom of the plate). My homemade flourless choc. cake was the best thing about the meal.  The owner was very nice, but I was just not that impressed with this food.  I've had way better Italian food in S. Florida.  Cheaper too."}
{"text":"Had a layover in Phoenix so left the airport just to see if Food Network was right. As soon as I arrived with my co-worker, the owner accomodated us, even though they were super-packed and had a waiting list of 5 parties. I love a friendly atmosphere and this is definitely it.

I recommend the black pasta with shrimp and calamari... sooo good! Also they prepared a special dish for my co-worker who's vegetarian and she was blown away.

I absolutely loved this place and the vibe and the good energy I felt. Definitely worth the cab ride there and back... and I hope one day they open a sister store in New York!!

Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  It's a tiny little hole in the wall with a waitress who has worked there forever.  The menu isn't extensive, but everything on it looks delicious.  We went here one night after work and couldn't have been happier.

I ordered gnocchi with the rosa sauce and it was incredible.  The gnocchi's were nice and small and cooked just right.  The sauce was to die for, with a hint of sweetness that made it perfect.  I don't have a whole lot to say other than that.  

I definitely want to go back.  I suggest it every now and then but for some reason we haven't revisited.  That is going to have to change."}
{"text":"Review is not for the food. I would have loved to have tried it... The wife and I show up with our 20 month old to be greeted with \"we only have 1 high chair and they just sat down\" seriously one high chair!! You can afford to invest in a sign that says \"as seen on Food Network\" but not more than one high chair. So much for being a \"family\" restaurant..."}
{"text":"This place is solid Italian food. The owner is very friendly and he told me they run the whole kitchen on 4 burners. Try the lisangna it's the best I'm town"}
{"text":"After being referred to this restaurant by some good friends of ours, we decided to try it out this evening. To our surprise we were not received to kindly by Mr. Giuseppe himself. It appears he is not fond of people of color. He gave us a look over that was racially driven while he told us it would be a long wait. I will never go back to this restaurant and would discourage anyone to give him your hard earned money."}
