{"text":"Love this place. Very good selection of hookah  pipes shishas and more. The food here is the best. thanks"}
{"text":"I found everything I needed to make an authentic fattoush salad here. They had other spices here that I have been looking for, including a nice chicken shawarma mix.   Everyone was friendly. The first gentleman who helped me didn't speak English, but the man at the counter helped me find the sumac and scooped it out of a big bag for me. I like that the spices and grains are kept in big sacks to be scooped out.  If you can read Arabic or are prepared to be social, this is a great little market to visit and get everything you need for a delicious Mediterranean dish."}
