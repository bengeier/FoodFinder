{"text":"Definitely the best juice/smoothie bar in the 'Burgh! I had the acai bowl and my brother had the vanilla berry shake - both amazing and tasted extremely fresh, not water down. Definitely going back here again!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! If you are used to natural food places from the Northwest, then you will be happy here. Great juices, smoothies, as well as bowls and toasts. They focus on super healthy and natural ingredients and everything is expertly prepared. Good people working there.   So far, this is the best juice/natural food place in Pittsburgh. Easy trip across the bridge by car or bike."}
{"text":"If you look up Zen Juice on their webpage http://www.zenjuicepgh.com/ you are not going to get much information about what juices they have or smoothies. Even when I did a search their facebook page said it was listed but I could not find it at all, until I looked through some of their pictures. The menu was in the pictures not in their information section, ooooohhh.    I was apprehensive but because I had lunch right next door I decided to pop on in. The decor is clean and modern looking and the service was really friendly. I liked the guy at the counter because he gave me a sample and was really helpful in picking out a juice.   I will say that their bottles seem to be smaller than some of the other juice companies in the area but the prices are the same. The menu is a little bigger and filled with juices and shakes that might be easier for the regular person to handle or to pick.   I picked a juice and my friend a smoothie. Both were great. I loved the cute bottles, even if they were smaller than I would have liked, and the juice went down pretty smoothly. I went with the O.C.S. Orange, cantaloupe, and strawberries. Really refreshing and the taste was perfect. Loved it. I even would have been good with a splash of seltzer mixed in. I would get it again.   My friend had the vanilla berry shake. It had strawberry, blueberry, raspberry, blackberry, banana, almond milk, and vanilla bean. The presentation of this drink was spot on. It was a thing of beauty. The drink was really good too. I only got a little bit of a taste but I would get it again.   This was a good experience. They even have a reward program so if you buy enough of the juices you can get one for free. I would come back and would get a smoothie or even one of those bowls.   Come in, try it out, pretty good time."}
