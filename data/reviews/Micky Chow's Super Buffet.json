{"text":"Had been here once last year and forgotten why I hadn't been back. Oh, yeah, now I remember. This place sucks!

The food is bland and uninteresting. The usual items you see in every Chinese buffet, but without the flavor. A few items puzzled me. Mac and cheese at a Chinese restaurant?? Cut up hot dogs wrapped in bacon??? Smoked sausage?? REALLY???? If you don't like Chinese food, why are you in a Chinese restaurant?

The server had only one thing to remember, our drink order, and she got it wrong. The place stunk of fried food and I had to change my clothes when I got home and wash up to get rid of the stench. One star is way too generous. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is what you expect at a Chinese Buffet and they do a pretty good job of it.  

They have a very large selection that includes Chinese, American, and a very limited amount of Sushi.

They have a number of healthy options such as broccoli chicken and a small salad bar, so even if you are on a diet, you could get a healthy lunch for $6.95.

I had not tried this place based upon the bad reviews on Yelp.  IMHO: Those bad reviews are baseless."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! They have an amazing sushi buffet and a hibachi bar to go along with their regular buffet. The service is always friendly, plus they have super afforable prices."}
{"text":"LOL Just as I expected............they have closed down AGAIN!  Gee, I wonder why?
Oh, I know, now this owner will once again change the name of the restaurant!
I guess he can't take the hint............
Get better food, better service and maybe you'll stay in business."}
{"text":"pretty good and inexpensive! =) I'm a fan, it's just not the absolute best i've ever had"}
