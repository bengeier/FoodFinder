{"text":"Don't ever go after 8pm. They simply do not care. Yes, they are open until 10:30 but you will not get fresh food on the hot bars. And if you complain or let them know, they don't care. Don't waste your time or money on this place."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a few times and each time we were disappointed the wait staff is hit or miss. The food on the bar is OK the sushi is will not eat any of the raw fish be a use it is not kept to the right temperature  the rice in the crab olls California rolls and others is dried out the sushi it's self gets dry from sitting out because no one eats it. (it is suppose to be chilled not room temp) all around not great and a lot of the food is not made fresh it's reheated or thawed. Deffiently won't be back anymore if you want a decent buffet but like sushi try the new Passion grill."}
{"text":"The Hibachi grill is OK, but is not equipped for large crowds. The buffet is very lackluster.  Need some spicier selections.  The price is great. The service is good and friendly."}
{"text":"Went on opening night. As you can imagine it was crowded and a little confused. When you walked in the door, you didn't know what to do. Two lines, no signage. Customers leaving directed us to Hostess Station. Hostess grabbed two sets of silverware an told us to follow her. Seated us at a table with blank check and then left. Did not know what to do. In a few moments we flagged down a waitress and asked her what we should do. She took our drink order and asked if we wanted the buffet. Asked her if they had a menu and she said she thought so. Told her we just wanted buffet. She told us to help ourselves.
 Went to salad bar first. Was going to get salad, but lettuce was full of onions. This pleased my wife, who loves onions, but displeased me, as I do not prefer onions. No salad. Went thru the rest of the food bars and it turns out somebody really likes onions. Raw onions too. I can tolerate cooked onions rather well in most foods, but the oinions in their foods were mostly uncooked or warmed. Even the fried rice was loaded with raw onions. Very disappointing. 
 Food that I did get was fair, if somewhat bland, as you would expect in a buffet. Hard to find any condiments, which this type of food needs. 
 Waitress was trying hard to take care of us. But you could tell there was the expected confusion. Also the silverware. It was a fork wrapped in a napkin. No spoons or knives? May re-try in six months."}
{"text":"Eh....it's a buffet And to boot another one in Gastonia.  We waited several months before trying this place out.  You can see they spent a lot of money on the decor.  Food was ok,  nothing to brag about.  Selection is the same as every other oriental buffet,  and that is including the sushi and hibachi grill.  Price was a little cheaper then some other places close by.   Would we return?  Maybe,  but the family still likes the others Chinese buffet behind them in the same area."}
{"text":"I ate here with my mom for the lunch buffet. I don't know if dinner is different so I'll let other reviewers grapple that beast.

When I walked into the building, I thought to myself \"Wow, this place is huge. There must be a really good selection.\" WRONG. It's 3 bars of salads, fruit and dessert with only 2 bars of actual food (not including the hibachi and sushi station). One bar is your standard Americanized Asian buffet food - chicken wings, the little flaky bread warpped around beef, etc... The other bar was more Asian food, but there wasn't anything special about it. It was just your standard take-out Asian food. 

The hibachi station was a little different than Gastonia's used to. I guess you could call it hibachi. It reminded me more of Mongolian grilling. You chose what veggies and meats you wanted to be cooked and placed it on a plate for the cooks to fry it up for you. You could choose to put an egg, lo mein noodles or rice in it as well. You're given a choice of hibachi or teriyaki sauce. Disclaimer: All the sauces taste the same to me so I just chose hibachi. The finished product was decent. It was better than the food at the hot bar, but not something that really stood out overall. 

Buffet sushi is buffet sushi. Period. 

The service was good. The waitress came by to check on you every now and then and to refill your water. I don't fault the staff for what Will B. said about the service. They're new. They're just feeling it out. I used to wait tables over the summer when I came back from college. I know how it is, so I'll be lenient about it. The food, though, isn't something that really stood out. I wouldn't be against going if my friends really wanted to eat there, but I wouldn't go back just for the sake of going back."}
{"text":"Really must say I was disappointed with this place.  It used to be a Ryan's Steakhouse and they have converted it the best they can.  With time they may get better, but with it just opening the food was sub par.  Our waitress was nice as well as the cooks, but it seems like they were out of place in a Hibachi Buffet.  Like Sarah P. said while there are quite a few buffet bars, only 2 of them had hot food. 

While this place may turn out to be good, my family and I will not be returning. We come from the West side of Charlotte and will just return to going to the Hibachi Grill off of Independence down in Matthews.  A little bit farther but a better meal."}
