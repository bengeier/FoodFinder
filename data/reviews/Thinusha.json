{"text":"My son wanted to come here... It's a takeout south Indian joint. We ordered the dosa.  Excellent.. Not to oily well made."}
{"text":"This place is a little hole in the wall, hard to find unless someone tells you about it.  A Sri Lankan friend always brought me spicy noodles with crispy Fried chicken in it and was craving them for the longest time, but wasn't willing to sit on the 401 all day to make the journey to Scarborough, so, when I found out there was a sri-lanken place near my work I had to try it.  The noodle dish is delicious! Very similar to the Scarborough resto, and only 7$ tax in! The wraps are very good as well, lots of filling and huge, 5$! Why would u go to a chain restaurant these days?  Support local family owned, they are more deserving of my hard earned dough, 4 out of 5, only because it's not something I could eat everyday"}
{"text":"Not bad. Prices and menu hard to follow as they were flashing on flat-screen TVs instead of on paper. Ordered the chicken kothu roti and the mutton curry which came with 3 veg curries and a massive portion of plain rice. Would have liked a little more of the veg curries and less rice. All was quite spicy. $7 each dish. Had passed inspection in Jan (google reviews had mentioned possible problems with kitchen cleanliness triggering an inspection). Service was OK, though they were busy enough that they forgot a wrap in the microwave and the foil paper it was wrapped in caught fire!"}
{"text":"Great soul food(if you have ever lived in SouthIndia). My favorite is their Kothu Rotti, Crab Curry and Of course their Dosa and Sambhar."}
{"text":"Ordered the Veg plate amongst other things through doordash and was very pleased with the quality of the food! Tastes just like Home!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good if you get here early enough. If you come too late or near closing, most items are already sold out. Prices are pretty good for what you get. More photos of the different dishes would be helpful since I don't normally eat Sri Lankan food."}
{"text":"Small mom and pop restaurant. The food is very good. Flavors that blend very well together."}
{"text":"Def an excellent Sri Lankan restaurant. Fantastic biryanis and kottu roti. (Traditional Sri Lankan food a mix of roti, veggies, spices, meats). The mutton biryani was actually quite good. I was a little surprised. Very busy. Try an order in. Took off a star cuz they barely ever pick up the phone and the service is 3/5. Good but not excellent. Also great little appetizers. The sambhar is actually better than most South Indian restaurants around."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some great Kothu Roti in Brampton this place will do the job. I had the Chicken Kothu and the Chilli Chicken.  The Kothu is made fresh and the food is not dry.   Good place to get some quick, well priced food."}
{"text":"I was in Brampton craving Kothu Roti (usually buy from Markham). I just happened to be in the area of this restaurant, and was definitely not disappointed.   I ordered their Chicken Kothu Roti. AMAZING! Was not oily, had all the right flavours I know Sri Lankan food to have, chicken was tender. Spicy, but anyone can handle this level of spice. I can't wait to return here.  Personally was impressed with the customer service. They were very friendly and accommodating. The lady that helped me asked if I had any dietary restrictions so that left a good impression in my mind. Appreciated the thoughtfulness (don't have any dietary restrictions), but at least you know that they've got you in mind.  VERY GOOD prices."}
{"text":"A huge letdown.  Dosas were neither crisp nor spicy. Setved with only coconut chutney. Big on quantity but not on quality. Most ordinary and below average."}
{"text":"If you are down for Sri Lankan food then stop by here. Food is yummy and spicy! Mom loves to go here from time to time. I just had the goat biryani on 2 occasion (dine in/takeout). Both times the portions were HUGE! Now I can tolerate spicy food so I will say this is spicy.  Aside from the taste, there is a generous portion of goat in it.   I wpuld give it a 4.5. The lack in half a star is because they forgot an order of mine. It's not really a big deal (coz they didn't charge me) but it was surprising coz in told them 3 times."}
