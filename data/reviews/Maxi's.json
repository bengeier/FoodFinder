{"text":"The can of \"Raid\" in the open cabinet at the bar speaks for itself - if you order ANY thing here make sure it comes from a sealed container."}
{"text":"We were there recently to host a rehearsal dinner, and I couldn't have been more pleased.  Their party room was separate from the restaurant (you did have to go up a flight of stairs) and was very nicely appointed. There was a bar and restroom right there so guests did not have to go up and down stairs.  We had a dedicated waiter who was awesome!  They had set up the tables as we had asked for .  The menu was delicious, with bruschetta, calamari, chicken, salad, cannolis and more.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Little Italy!!  The calamari is the best I've ever had.  I usually opt for pizza, my husband loves the stuffed peppers.  We usually sit at the bar and split appetizers or sit out front.  The patio is great in the back.  I've never had a bad meal and the service is always excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Our family went here early on New Year's Eve after a trip to the CMA for a quick dinner.  The calamari was crisp and well-seasoned, and the pizzas that we ordered were tasty.   The reason for the 4 stars rather than a 5 had to do with the service.  The waiter was competent but seem more interested in the crowds coming in later.  He did not really engage us and actually ignored our requests.  We are accustom to eating at good restaurants and were put off by this particular waiter!  We would still return for the great food!"}
{"text":"Changed chef/ownership a while back. Gave them several opportunities on their slow decline before I yelped negative.

They tried to keep the same menu items but it is obvious that Maxi's is at least sourcing inferior ingredients, if not changing the recipes over all. 

Pastas were all over-done, pizzas were totally different- dough was under-done, can't even comment on the crust because there was no \"crust\"- all mushy. Center was raw. All meat items were dry and unsavory. Gilbert's once perfect Calamari, mussels and clams were all consistently rubbery throughout many recent visits, and his once famous stuffed peppers were flacid & stuffed with a dry, over-salted meat mixture. Many different sauces were ordered at the table- all tasted \"fresh\"... from the can, that is. 

The server was \"nice\", and certainly tried, but was completely ill-prepared to and uneducated... This person could not answer one question about ANY menu item... Not even whether or not they had a certain very typical banal beer. After five minutes of waiting for her to ask someone else, this person came back to the table and said they had it (but didn't bring it), my guest said \"well yes\" he'd like to have it... So this person disappeared again for another five minutes, and then reappeared with a completely different item. Antics like this were the only consistent part of the service we received over 3 hours- and we were the only table in the place.  (To be fair, there were two other tables of two, outside, with a different server- and upon exiting I noticed they all looked about as happy as we did.)

After observing \"management\" throughout the evening, it just became more and more evident that our poor server could not have possibly received adequate training- if there was any training at all. I cannot blame the server for the poor service. I've spent much of my adult life in service industry management- and when our servers fail, it is OUR fault. This guy watched everything unravel for 3 hours, and did nothing- gave no assist to our server at all. Maybe he knew this person would soon be fired so he didn't care? I don't know... Still my $250 spent just for the server to go down in flames while management (or whoever he was) watched tv at the bar. So sad.

For 10+ years prior, I always highly recommended Maxi's in Little Italy. Very loyal customer. Friends used to complain to me about the price at Maxi's compared to other places on Murray Hill, but I always swore to them that the price was worth the great food and great service. Now, I am so embarrassed. I can only hope they all forgot.

To add insult to injury, I (and everyone else in my small party) spent the next day on the toilet :( Not pretty.

Final straw. Won't go back; not worth the risk. Buyer beware. 

There are too many other places on Murray Hill to patronize until Maxi's changes hands again. Hopefully soon."}
{"text":"I think Little Italy is overrated as a whole. Coming from an Italian family I am not blown away by any restaurants down there. The ambiance is really cool and it's nice to see cities that try to maintain their Italian heritage. In my opinion that's what these overpriced restaurants are relying on. Maxi's is very small. My girlfriend and I were sitting so close to another table we heard they're entire conversation and I'm sure they heard ours. I went there primarily because I had their tripe during the Feast of the Assumption and it was very good. The problem was that it was about $6 at the feast and about $17 at their restaurant. It was good but tripe shouldn't be nearly that expensive. My girlfriend got a chicken dish which was average at best. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on father's day and it was great. My man got the spaghetti and meatballs, I got the goat cheese ravioli, everything was divine. Good service, nice atmosphere, the music is sort of on the sexy modern Italian side of things. Cute seating on the sidewalk during warm weather but we chose a nice window seat. Quiet during the day. Food was definitely fresh, tasted like something my grandmother would have made (if she were Italian). We'll be going back."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat in Little Italy. From the appetizers to the pastas to the pizza, you can enjoy many styles of a meal. The seating on the front sidewalk (limited) is great for people watching, and there is dining on a back patio as well. Chef/owner Fatmir is wonderful, along with the staff who remember you when you return."}
{"text":"We came here with a party of 6, we got one refill on our drinks the entire time, way overpriced and it looked like someone poured water on my spaghetti. Save the time and go elsewhere in little Italy."}
{"text":"First time at Maxi's was a great one!  Made reservations, but there is no Host/Hostess to speak of.  Restaurant is small so we ran into a Server who sat us right away at a table that had just cleared.  Just not sure that the reservation would have done much being such a small room.

The service was pretty much on point.  We did need to request water refills a few times, and my requested crushed red pepper never made it to the table though.  

The food was excellent.  Portions were huge.  The sauce on the pastas was a little sweet for my wife's taste, but I thought it was delicious.  My chicken Marsala had enough roasted red pepper and portobello that there was some in every bite.

Music selection was strange for a spot in Little Italy and did nothing for the ambiance.  We heard a bit too many 80's hits while we were there...  

And although this is not Maxi's fault since it's a private service, our car smelled of smoke when Valet returned it to us."}
{"text":"I just can't understand why would someone give non-five-star to this wonderful restaurant. Meat balls here are of rich flavors!"}
{"text":"Overall a good expierence with a great pizza. It was 105$ for 4. Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo- Ok. Bruschetta- Ok. Pasta- Ok but dry. Pizza- Good. Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli- Excellent! The Service was good and a little fast."}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch with a group of friends (5 of us total). I was a little confused with the atmosphere, the bar seats were filled with people eating and drinking at around 3pm. We were seated in the front of the restaurant at a table very quickly (A+ for speed). The waitress quickly took our drink orders and was quick to bring over drinks and take our order. 

For appetizers we had sauteed calamari and bruschetta classico which were both great. The calamari would have actually been a great lunch on it's own with a little bread. The bruschetta was a little heavy on onions for some people in my group but I thought it tasted very fresh. 

When it came to the entree things started going a little awry. Myself and two other people in my group ordered the goat cheese ravioli. We all agreed that it was luke warm at best. The ravioli itself tasted great, but it was very hard getting over the temperature issue. 

Regardless, this was a pretty standard non-chain Italian restaurant with a family feel. My recommendation would be to get the sauteed calamari and a little bread and call it a meal."}
{"text":"This review is strictly about the pizza.  Not a fan of the super sweet sauce.  It's a real distraction as I'm trying to enjoy the other tastes. The cheese was fine and plentiful. The (bottom) crust was WAY too thick and almost undercooked.  I attribute this gooey crust to the fact it's served on a glass plate.  I'm a fan of NY style - if you are as well, this is not your pizza place."}
{"text":"Best alfredo sauce ever, the nutmeg probably. Pizza was OK, but a little thick and undercooked or my taste. I ordered goat cheese ravioli, but i couldnt taste the goat cheese. I wondered if they gave me spinch ravioli instead. No big deal, it tasted great anyway. Best part was the bread and dipping sauce. Great atmosphere and very nice service."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I was highly disappointed. I placed an order to go Shrimp Pasta. When I went back to my hotel, I opened my container I saw that i only had 3 shrimp in my pasta. They might as well have called it artichoke pasta since there was a.lot more that than shrimp. In addition, the bread knots that were included were hard. maybe yesterday's bread. Also, the  service wasn't really that great either. I will never go there again. Waste of my money."}
{"text":"I heard about Cleveland's Little Italy and I had to check it out for myself. We decided on Maxi's Ristorante for lunch and I'm so glad we did. It was a beautiful day with a little table available outside. We started with a calamari appetizer and the flavor was so earthy and delicious. Fresh!!!
My Italian husband ordered linguine and meatballs because he can't refuse a meatball!!  I had the carbonara and was rich AND light. Masterfully done, Maxi's. We will be back. Next time we will save room for dessert. 

Also- the service was top notch!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great service from RJ!   The calamari flash fried was outstanding. Even the special olive oil dip for the bread was extraordinary.  Fun atmosphere on the first floor.  Veal piccata, goat cheese ravioli highly recommended.  You can pass on the frog legs however."}
{"text":"We went to Maxi's for dinner tonight for New Years Eve at 5 PM. I hate giving 3 starts because the food was really good and our server was amazing. My problem was with the very rude manager. We were a large party with several children. Now I admit, they were being loud and a little unruly,but we were the only table seated in the upstairs room. We kept asking if other tables needed to be seated upstairs and what time so that we could finish up in time so as not to disturb other dinners. The waiter was so kind and patient and said we were okay and had time. All of the sudden, the manager stormed up saying we had to go, the children were not behaving and he was waiting to seat other parties upstairs. We all felt horrible and tired to explain that we asked multiple times what time other parties were coming up and we would make sure to leave. The manager was almost yelling, he was so rude and I was almost in tears. We were all apologizing, running around cleaning up and were basically kicked out before we could even order dessert. The craziest part was when we went downstairs to leave, we looked in the dining room and it was almost completely empty!! You would think they would have been happy for us to be spending so much money upstairs in an almost empty restaurant. Maxis has been a favorite of my family's since I was a kid. I feel so sad having this last impression of Maxis. What a sad way to end a fun dinner on NYE."}
{"text":"Brought some family in from out of town to try out the food in Little Italy.  We were not disappointed.  Had three of their specialty pizzas, all great!  The owner's son and his staff are friendly and attentive.  This is definitely a place to go with friends and family."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by this restaurant. Service was not good pizzas were coming one after an other with 10mins between each, I ordered pasta and the sauce was salty and watery. They were out of meatballs because they had not been delivered which means meatballs are not home made, to bad for an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Their \"red\" sauce is amazing. Not your typical marinara sauce. Very good."}
{"text":"I almost never go to the east side. It's my secret goal to become one of \"those people\" who never leaves the side of town where they live. HOWEVER, i went to dinner with my parents at maxi's because of my mom's claim on how good the food is.

she's right - the food is really good. i'm not a huge italian fan, but we had the calamari (allegedly the best in little italy, which i find to be a bold statement), the sauteed escarole, and i had goat cheese ravioli while the parents both had linguini and meatballs (or, meatbulbs, if you're me.) i had no booze, but moms had a glass of red.

i am known to totally stuff myself with bread and not eat any of my entree, but shockingly that didn't happen this time, though the bread is very good. i could have just eaten the entire plate of escarole, but that is mostly personal greens addiction. they are a little heavy, but if you split them around the table it's more than enough for three people.

the ravioli was good, though i had my heart set on carbonara. this didn't happen, sadly, because there was no prosciutto. i know, right? an italian restaurant w/o prosciutto? apparently it was a one-time thing, and i certainly hope so. the raviolis themselves were very good, the sauce was a little heavy for me but that's my aversion i guess.

we had excellent service - our waitress was super accommodating and helpful. no complaints there whatsoever. 

definitely a recommended spot out of the many options in the neighborhood - there were plenty of septuagenarian local dudes hanging out at the table next to us gabbing and that was definitely entertaining."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food at Maxi's. Room upstairs is perfect for hosting medium sized group parties."}
{"text":"Great food great atmosphere!!! Started with calamari, fresh warm bread, then cavatelli with polpetine/meatballs. Finished with cannoli!! Asked for espresso and loved when asken by the server...do you want it ristretto/short or regular?!?...amazing!!! Will come back!!"}
{"text":"Always excellent! Delicious food & great drinks with friendly service!! Don't miss this venerable establishment in Little Italy! My fave!"}
{"text":"This quaint restaurant in the heart of Little Italy is perfect for a date night or night out on the town. Although it can be a bit crammed, the ambiance of the venue makes up for the lack of space. The inviting atmosphere, paired with great service, makes for a relaxing and enjoyable dining experience.

Although a few of my family members who I was dining with weren't entirely thrilled with some of the entrees, I must confess that the calamari was to die for. You don't want to pass this up. 

Also, their pizzas were tasty, but not worth the price. 

Overall, I'd Maxi's a thumbs up; especially if you're looking for a place to kick back and relax after exploring the area."}
{"text":"Okay, so just to warn everyone, this is a very positive review and you will not read a single complaint in this entire post. I came to Cleveland with my boyfriend last weekend to run in A Christmas Story race. We are distance runners and strong believers of carb loading the night before our races. I was ecstatic to see that Cleveland had a Little Italy (I've been to and eaten in NYC's), so I knew I had to find a place to eat there. Something about the little neon sign and the fact that they had cavatelli and meatballs drew me toward Maxi's. I made a reservation so in advance that it is actually hilarious, but I couldn't contain my excitement. When we got there, we were seated right away at a little table in the front of the restaurant (right by the little neon sign I love). I ordered my cavatelli and meatballs and a mixed mesclun salad. My boyfriend also ordered the salad and got the penne pasta alla flavia with added meatballs. The food was literally some of the best I've ever had. The cavatelli were perfect and al dente, and the little meatballs were to die for. My boyfriend loved his dish and thought the shrimp were great (he accidentally flung a shrimp tail at me but that didn't even ruin the night). We finished with the tiramisu which I was too full to try, but I heard great things about it. I recommend everyone try Maxi's if you're in Little Italy CLE."}
{"text":"We chose Maxi's for lunch because none of the other places on the street looked open.  My husband and I both thought the food was much better than expected.  He loved the olive oil and parmesan combo they brought with the bread, as well as his penne alla flavia.  I had the calamari pasta, and thought the light tomato sauce was absolutely perfect.  It also had a ton of calamari, way more than necessary.

I don't know if they have additional dining space beyond the main bar area that you see when you walk in.  It's quite small, and probably not a good choice for large or even mid-sized groups."}
{"text":"Maxi's knows how to do happy hour! And for once, I'm not talking about the drinks/drink specials that are featured, I'm talking about the food/food deals! Maxi's food is spot on any time of the day, but during happy hour, it's not only delicious, but it's perfectly priced! You certainly can't go wrong with some skillfully sautéed and sauced calamari (best in town) and an artichoke pizza with an ice cold Stella. Seriously. Fabulous. And when you're saving dollars, it's even better! (Happy hour alleviates my previous price complaint.)

Refer to my previous review for the calamari. Now, the pizza. This pizza was exactly what I expected and wanted! Soft, warm crust. Cheesy, artichokey. Great! Definitely recommended. Also, it reheats well! 

There can be some seating hiccups, especially if you come on a Wednesday (I think?) night and want to sit at the bar for the happy hour deals. We staked out some seats for quite awhile just for some calamari and a beer, but it was totally worth it. I'm not sure if it really depends on the night you come here, or if it's just a random crowd, but it can get hairy in this tiny joint if you don't plan ahead. 

Sometimes the service can be iffy, but that's with any place. You just have to snag a bartender when you need one and make sure you place your order quick!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Maxi's and it's become our go-to place whenever we venture down to Murray Hill. Their food and service has a level of consistency and quality that keeps us returning. We last ventured down on a Saturday night in late February and did not make a reservation so we found 2 spots at the bar and were completely content. If you'd prefer to be seated I'd recommend making a reservation especially if you're dining on a weekend night. We've had several items on their menu over the course of the last few years but most recently split the fresh mozzarella and tomato basil salad and the Little Italy pizza which comes with fresh tomato basil sauce, Parmesan cheese, black pepper, and hot crushed red pepper. Everything was delicious and the pizza was more than enough, we had plenty leftover to take home. Our service was superb - quick, attentive and friendly. Lastly, the nice thing about Maxi is you can enjoy a full-on dining experience, walk in for a quick glass of wine and a light bite (highly recommend the calamari) or stop in for a freshly brewed espresso. Whatever mood you're in, I highly suggest you put Maxi on your list of must eat places in Cleveland's Little Italy."}
{"text":"I was craving Italian and an inviting atmosphere so I decided on Maxi's because I wanted to try somewhere I hadn't been in Little Italy. The place is pretty small and a bit more casual than most in that area but still very cute and clean inside. Parking around there is a cluster but they have valet for $7 which isn't bad. We got seated right up front with a window seat which I loved too. 

Let's get to the good stuff. The food was just what I needed and so good. We decided to split a salad, Darcy's pizza, and Cavatelli w meatballs. Everything was delicious and loved the butter garlic sauce on the pizza combined with the spicy banana peppers. Portions are large so that's why we split everything. Our waitress was nice and attentive as well. Pricing isn't cheap but not too expensive especially for the portions you receive. If I wasn't a west sider I would frequent more often but will be back and recommend."}
{"text":"Nice place to stop by to have some drinks. The service was a bit slow and the menus were all dusty. The sangria and the bruschetta were good tho. And prices are affordable"}
{"text":"I agree that the service can be really hit or miss but the calamari is terrific and I absolutely love the 'Gilbert's Pizza', the 'Little Italy Pizza'. I tend to do takeout from here more often than dine-in but, a summertime windowseat is just lovely. Wine list could use some work, but have had a few decent glass pours."}
{"text":"Really not comparable to any average East Coast pizza place. 

Pizza crust--soggy. Penne--from a box. Sauce--watery. Cannoli--tasteless. All of it--overpriced.

All the 4-5 star reviews--puzzling."}
{"text":"That was my second worst pizza I've ever eaten! with my friend we had 2 pizzas, and I as well as him we both had stomach problems. It was not tasteful it was awful"}
{"text":"There are so many options in Cleveland's Little Italy and we were glad that we went with Maxi's.  It was a hot day and a few other restaurants on the street did not have AC which was unacceptable.  Maxi's offered a cool space for us with a table for 6 in their upstairs.  The service was pretty slow but we were enjoying our evening. They have a few bottled beers and cocktails. I went with the red sangria which was pretty tasty. The menu has appetizers, salads (only entrée size), pasta and pizza to choose from.  Most of us went with a pasta entrée and I got the rigatoni with red sauce and meatballs. The meatballs were a mixture of meats and very tasty.  Their sauce is very sweet which I really liked. The prices are fair with pasta entrees ranging from $12-$18."}
{"text":"We held a club event here so first of all, they were very accommodating and kind to our members.  We were upstairs and had the entire floor to ourselves and it was so cozy and perfect!  Plus our waiter got quite a workout running up and down the stairs.  

  We only shared a pizza and cannoli, but it was some fantastic pie and a creamy dessert.   I didn't hear any complaints of the other 18 or so entrees and most people raved over their food.  

  This was also my first visit to Cleveland's Little Italy and I was impressed - very cute for an evening stroll in the summer!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little Italian restaurant and it doesn't really have much flare or anything but holy cow was the food delicious. I tried the calamari and spaghetti with meatballs. I don't mentally catalogue all of the calamari I try but theirs was probably the best I have ever had. The spaghetti with meatballs was delicious as well and I was sad when my plate was empty. Gotta give a special shout out on the meatballs. They were made with pork and beef and not too dry and not too soggy. Just perfect. I'm hoping I get a chance to come back by Cleveland to try this place out. I'm not sure how their pizza is but everyone at our table ordered off the pasta menu and not one of us left dissapointed."}
{"text":"Although the interior of Maxi's may feel like it hasn't been updated since the 70s, this is the perfect lunch or dinner spot for a delicious pizza and people watching!

I was pleasantly surprised at how fresh the mozzarella was here in both the meatball pizza and the fried mozzarella. The pizza was perfect: not too doughy, not too thin, with the right amount of sauce. 

I heard the couple behind us saying their calamari wasn't good, so perhaps this isn't a good place for any seafood dish. Stick to pizza (and why wouldn't you in Little Italy?)!

I don't think the food and atmosphere matches the price, unfortunately. What we got were safe dishes, all things considered. I've eaten here before and was disappointed in the pasta, so I knew better this time around."}
{"text":"We stopped in here because the initial restaurant we wanted to go to wasn't opened yet. We were seated right away. I noticed seating in the front outside, within the bar area, as well as an outdoor patio area outside. It was an odd time during the week, like 3:00 pm, so the place wasn't too busy. We decided to eat outside. All items are a la carte, but we did get a basket of fresh warm bread. We ordered the stuffed banana peppers which were perfect. You get two peppers for $12, maybe a little pricey, but they were tasty. I ordered the carbonara, DELISH! A perfect blend of spices and prosciutto, the peas popped in your mouth. The other items ordered were the spinach ravioli, they were served in a vodka sauce and every bite was good. However, this dish is served with only 4 ravioli's, priced at $16-18, that's $4+ per ravioli. The other dish was the Farfalle with the sausage and onions. Once again, extremely tasty. Our waitress was excellent and very attentive. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Visiting Little Italy for the first time and looking for some excellent and authentic Italian pizza, I was a little disappointed with Maxi's. The restaurant is small and cozy, with nice music and atmosphere. Our waiter was friendly. For the price we paid, the pizza was just average in my opinion. The dough lacked in quality, and tasted like it had a bit too much sugar added. The ingredients were just okay, nothing that great. I may return, try something else, like pasta, and update my review."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous! We stopped in for happy hour specials and were pleasantly surprised by the best calamari EVER. Plus a creative pizza menu and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Little Italy. Always friendly staff and great service and back patio.  Not to mention the pizza"}
{"text":"The good was average not bad now great. The big problem is the portion  size.  23 dollars for spinach ravioli and you get 4 small pieces.  This is not a high end Italian restaurant it's a nice friendly neighborhood restaurant and that for a portion size is ridiculous. The chicken marsala was good but again very small portion and the same for the linguine with clams. It was in a small bowl and not worth the cost at all.  The pizza looked good and at least it's the size of a normal pizza."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a quick bite to eat after visiting the Cleveland Aquarium and to get some Italian baked goods in the area.  It was around 3:00pm and we were the only people in the place.  They had a bartender who was also our waitress and a few of the other employees were sitting at the bar.  The menu has some good options and the wine list is great.  We really wanted some pizza after a long cold morning of walking  so we ordered the Little Italy pizza and two glasses of water.  The waitress brought us one cold water and one hot water  which I thought was a little odd  but we just shared the ice water.  The pizza came out pretty quickly and it looked and smelled amazing.  We are big pizza fans, and I couldn't wait to dig in.  The taste and spices were really good, BUT the pizza dough wasn't completely cooked.  The middle on one side was still soft and gooey.  At this point the bar started to get busy and our waitress didn't come back to check on us, so we ate the side that was kinda cooked.  Usually I would say something, but we were so hungry and didn't want to wait to get her attention.  But considering that it wasn't busy when we ordered, there was no reason for the kitchen to hurry.  We also had to wait awhile to get our bill, and never got drink refills.   Its a great place to grab a drink if your in the area, but I wouldn't stop for a meal.  Next time we'll try La Dolce Vita across the street."}
{"text":"Had dinner while visiting Little Italy. 

They sat us upstairs which is much quieter and relaxing than the ground level. 

The calamari is very good as it's tossed in a garlic sauce after frying. Cooked just right not tough at all. 

My wife had the veal chop and wholly cow (no pun intended) it's huge and served on the bone. Cooked as ordered and she said the flavor was amazing. We also ordered the linguini with clams in white wine sauce and the chicken catcciatore. Linguini was excellent and so was the chicken. Wish there was more chicken though. 

Overall I would go back again in a heartbeat. 

Sorry - no dessert. Had too many cookies at the Italian bakery down the street!"}
{"text":"Came here on a random Wednesday night craving the authenticity of Little Italy. Had the Farfalle pasta and a glass of Malbec. Service was prompt. Would have liked to see more pasta in an $18 entrée, but the tradeoff was the sauce - robust and full of flavor!! Not a bad first time!"}
{"text":"Awesome sauce(s)!  They know what they are doing with their sauces.  Included in this is their olive oil with Parmesan that they have for the super tasty pre-dinner bread.  Also super enjoyed the fresh tomato basil sauce on the stuffed hot (yes they were) banana peppers for the appetizer. And for the main course I got the spinach ravioli in a dreamy tomato basil & cream sauce topped with Parmesan.  Yes, I licked it clean.  I'm sad I didn't ask if they bottled that sauce so I could take some home.

This place is on the smaller side so make sure to have reservations or stop in on off times.  I also recommend skipping the pizza.  Two friends I went with got different pizzas but neither were all that impressive."}
{"text":"A pretty fun place to go in Little Italy. 

My favorite thing is the bowl of muscles.  For about fourteen clams, you can get the largest bowl of muscles I've ever seen.  Ravioli is good, as well.  And sometimes the bartenders are great (but not always).  One time I ordered a Negroni and they had no idea how to make it, but after I explained it, the bartender made one of the best Negronis I've had in Cleveland.  This is a rarity.

The waitstaff can be hit-or-miss.  I have been there and had a great waitress, and have been there where the waitress pays hardly attention to the table.  However, I tend to just write this off to the \"Italian Experience\" even though i shouldn't."}
{"text":"We came in when it was nearly empty and our food came super fast. Everything was delicious. Portions were normal sized, no leftovers to take home. Often times at Italian restaurants the portions are enormous so the cost evens out. This wasn't that kind of place. For instance I ordered shrimp and pasta for $18 and received about two cups of pasta, a lot of artichoke hearts and 4 shrimp. Thats right, 4. I also ordered a hot cider which was delicious."}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken piccata. It came with one small piece of chicken. Seriously I had to look under the piece of chicken thinking there was another hiding!  $22!! When I was telling the bartender he was smiling and could care less.  That's because his cousin owned it. What a joke. The bartender was so rude. Total ripoff. We will never go there again\
Growing up in the neighborhood and going there for years, this place has really changed. We had so many good times there never again"}
{"text":"Loved it! My favorite restaurant in Little Italy so far. Calamari is the best I've ever had. I also had the shrimp penne in the vodka tomato cream sauce and it was great.

Service was quick and polite. Atmosphere is a little more casual than most in Little Italy, but I'll definitely be back thanks to the great food."}
{"text":"This restaurant has long been a staple of quality on the local food scene, with an excellent menu along with a full bar! This review is long overdue as I've been eating here for years. On my most recent visit, I went in for lunch and decided to try the Spinach Ravioli with blush sauce. For starters, bread is served with every entree and it comes with a plate of olive oil. Once my entree arrived, it was a reasonable portion of handmade ravioli with ricotta and spinach and was excellent! One last pointer, the calamari here is outstanding and is served as a happy hour special!"}
{"text":"Went here with my BFF & husband while my son had surgery at Cleveland Clinic. They live there so it was their suggestion. Had spaghetti & meatballs. Can't say it was awesome, just good. Overall, no complaints. Located in Little Italy, which had more Italian restaurants I would have tried. But our time was limited. Nice waitstaff."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a late dinner with a date. This seems like a very old style family run place to eat. Not fancy or pretentious at all. Service was attentive but in a homey way and not as crisply professional as other places very near by. 

Had the calamari ap based on other reviews. Wonderful. Worth it. Large portion for two people. 

Asked about the tomatoes with buffalo mozzarella. We were worried the tomatoes wouldn't be good in late May. We were told they were \"amazing.\" Well, no they weren't. They were just like you'd expecting the end of a May in Cleveland, hot house bland. The mozzarella didn't appear house made or especially good either. And there was a shortage of small balls of it in my opinion. 

We ordered spaghetti and meatballs to split as an entree. The balls were bland and the spaghetti was overcooked and mushy. In an Italian place, in this part of town, that's inexcusable. There are better choices on the menu."}
{"text":"A great place !! The food had the rich creamy garlic italian flavor. The pizzas are all very well prepared with fresh ingredients. The wine selection is good for an amateur wine consumer. A good place to spend time at."}
{"text":"Best calamari in town. I suggest the Sangria and every pizza flavor is delicious. Check out the patio in the back. Great kept secret."}
{"text":"Too bright in the bar. Dim the lights a bit bro. Pizza I ordered tasted like it had just been thawed out .   Crust was poor and the pizza wasn't adequately cooked. This is not the pizza of Maxi of Old. I won't be back."}
{"text":"After hearing rave review about this place, I decided to give it a shot for lunch. Ordered the calamari upon recommendation. It was OK, very flavorful, but very acidic. 
Ordered the Carbonara. Real disappointment. Straight up bland heavy cream, watery, bland, not authentic whatsoever. I dont understand why restaurants can't make it with eggs..

I ordered something else.. but it was forgettable. 

The crowd seemed to be composed of well-dressed regulars, many of whom sat at the bar.
Idk.. I thought this was a very mediocre restaurant in terms of food. 
But at least the waitress was friendly and decor had its sweet european bistro vibe to it. I may return if I get bored of the surrounding restaurants, but that may take some time

Food: B-
Atmosphere: B
Service: B"}
{"text":"Best calamari ever!  Seriously.  Best ever.

I tried this joint in Cleveland's Little Italy and can't wait to travel back to the area to have that calamari.  See you in early February."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great service! We went on a eating binge during our last visit to Maxi's in Little Italy, and could not have been happier with our food choices. They were all delicious and so were the drinks. I had not had white sangria in a long time, and I was glad that Maxi's white sangria did not disappoint - delicious on a hot Spring day! We love Maxis!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Would have liked a salad, but no side salad on the menu.  Ordered goat cheese ravioli. Ravioli and sauce were good, but only three medium ravioli on the plate.  Seemed pretty skimpy, even for lunch.  Four dollars per ravioli.  Service was good, but I'll go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"I have a quandary rating Maxi's because service was so sloooowww, but the food was absolutely delicious. I was so hungry when we got to Maxi's and it took them over an hour to bring out our food. Mind you that the place wasn't busy. There were maybe 3 tables including us. Even bread took around 20 mins to bring out. Yes, it was fresh baked, crispy, chewy and scrumptious, but why did it take so long?! They also failed to bring out the pizza with the salad which left me even hungrier. Salad by the way was a pile of lettuce and nothing else for $7. Now for the good stuff. The pizza was superb, crispy crust and super flavorful. Chicken piccata was alright as were the sides of pasta that came with the entrees, but the absolute best thing we got was the penne with shrimp in this incredibly spicy vodka sauce. YUM. 
Bottom line: Food is good, but the restaurant is so slow. Order takeout."}
{"text":"Checked out Maxi's today for dinner with a group of friends. Quite impressed! Nice ambiance, with options to dine in front, inside, and in the back patio. Pretty casual place too, so don't be self-conscious if you're not dressed up to the nines (or even the fives, really). Happy Hour until 6:30pm Monday through Thursday, with some pretty awesome deals: $3 beers, $6 wines/sangria, $10 all pizzas (14\" and large enough for 2-3 hungry people), $10 mussels, and $10 calamari. We all had a drink and a pizza to ourselves, with none of us finishing more than four of our eight slices--leftovers anyone? 

Pizza was fresh and hot, crust nice and chewy, with some intriguing toppings. I opted for Gilbert's pizza, with tomato sauce, ricotta cheese, proscuitto, and kalamata olives which was pretty darn tasty. Other combinations sounded great too, from traditional margherita to a smoked salmon pizza (might be more of a flatbread kind of thing at this point, but let's not get hung up on semantics). Service was attentive, refilled our waters frequently, and was very accommodating, readily splitting our check five ways. 

Bottom line: tasty pizza, thrifty happy hour, spectacular service."}
{"text":"We made an appointment for a Friday night at Max's Tavern in Little Italy. My opinion of Little Italy is that it is highly overrated and I don't know what all the fuss is about. I can find some great Italian cooking within a 2-mile radius of my home in the suburbs that seems to me a whole lot better than what's offered in Little Italy. This place has an old school Italian feel much like you would expect to see Tony Soprano sitting in the back corner reservation and they were able to accommodate us immediately. As with the other reviews on Yelp about this particular restaurant to service lacking to say the least. Although the fellow who was our server appeared to be from Italy you did not did not have much in the way of attention to detail or even has to move his feet a little faster. He did get us a bottle of wine which was priced at about what you think about the wine will be priced at in Little Italy LOL overpriced. He did tell us about the Spanish specials they had for that evening but did not tell us what the prices were more on that later.

The physical building is very very old and I believe if you had a code inspector come and inspect these places on Restaurant Row in Little Italy every one of them would be shut down. There are many issues with Electrical Plumbing in fire safety this simply would not fly today but passes as acceptable in Little Italy. The bathrooms for example are ridiculously small and I don't see how they could be a ADA accessible. That and they definitely were warned and not very clean.

What are the specials that was available was my wife had a shrimp and pasta meal and I had one of the other specials which is a chicken parmesan meal. White chicken parmesan is a special and not on the menu ordinarily is beyond me. It's a piece of fried chicken pasta and sauce really not that difficult. Our server did bring some bread which was nice and the food came rather quickly as the place started to fill up. By the way there is no parking here are you pretty much have to valet park it hits the only way to not go insane before you have a meal. My chicken parmesan was a generous portion of chicken it was cooked rather well chocolate sauce Parmesan cheese and Cavatelli.  My only real gripe was that the sauce was just not good at all. If I'm not good I mean Super Duper salty. Like somebody accidentally dumped the whole jar of Morton salt into the sauce and said well maybe they won't notice kind of salty. The kids noticed the same thing they both got pasta and meatballs. The portion was definitely not portions with the intent of them packing stuff up for you to take home it was a pretty small portion before the price I think it was under portion. My wife's pasta and shrimp she said was really really good till we got the bill and found out that it was $38! There aren't many places you can go in Cleveland that have $38 pasta specials. Had I known that I definitely would have would not have ordered it. Three stars for parking price and the building."}
{"text":"Great food, one of the best frog legs I have ever had. The escargot and clams are always phenomenal! The martinis are always spot on!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner, based on the reviews. The service was god-awful - would rather go elsewhere in Little Italy. The food was okay. We got one of the tables overlooking Mayfield - saving grace on a summer evening when Little Italy is so alive."}
{"text":"We had our daughters college graduation meal this afternoon at Maxis. I emailed back and forth from North Carolina about what they thought would be the best way to handle the celebration for around twenty guests. They suggested a family style menu and sent me several options. We arrived a little early, and the table upstairs was already all set and ready to go! Our service was top notch! We had salad, calamari, cavatelli, chicken Marsala and cannoli - and lots of wine! Price was excellent and everyone left very full and happy! Couldn't have asked for a better set up! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Absolutely worst possible experience. We booked the Maxi's Banquet room for our wedding rehearsal dinner. Excited to show off Little Italy to our wedding guests, we chose Maxi's because they offered us private banquet room for our group of 25 out of town guests.  

We worked with the restaurant manager, Fatian, 8 months in advance to book the space and select a customized menu well in advance. When we arrived, the hostess told us the room was not ready- they had booked another rehearsal dinner in the banquet room just before ours. They said the other group was \"wrapping up\"  and asked us to wait a few minutes. 

So, there we were....25 of us, all dressed up for a rehearsal dinner, standing on the curb of Maxi's in Little Italy crowded around the little hostess stand. After 20 minutes of waiting, we were anxious. After 30 minutes, we were frustrated. After 50 minutes of waiting for a banquet room we booked well in advance, and when the restaurant manager finally came to even acknowledge us, he asked us to \"wait just a little longer\". He was completely clueless. Fed up and frustrated, not just because we were already waiting nearly an hour, but also because the other party wasn't even done with their  dinner yet. Clearly, we weren't getting into the banquet room any time soon and yet Fatian kept asking us to \"just wait\". 

Luckily, we were able to take our 25 guests across the street to Gusto! Ristorante Italian where they took us in, sat us, and make a delicious meal in no time. The Accordian even played for us to provide upbeat entertainment. 

Huge thank you to Gusto for saving the day, and a huge disappointment in Maxi's and their incredibly slow and completely not concerned staff."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and full of flavor. Bread was delicious and fresh as well, with a tasty Parmesan oil. They made a nice martini.  The staff was really friendly. Loved my first experience at Maxi's."}
{"text":"Not a lot to say about this experience.. the food was ok. I honestly felt it was something I could make myself at home. The bar is set high for Italian food in this area so I was a little disappointed. The farfalle Pasta was good but not outstanding. The stuffed pepper appetizer was good, it was spicy but it should be! Way overpriced though, $12 for one pepper cut in half. I would go back but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"My family has lived in Little Italy for almost 100 years so I havent had much of a chance to eat in any of the local restaurants.  But now that my Grandma, Great Aunt and Uncle have passed away, I can now try them out.

Maxi's is my favorite, although Il Baccio is close.  Gilbert has some great dishes on the menu.  When we were there, we had Pizza and sat at the bar, it was a nice but slightly crowded atmosphere.  While waiting for our pizza, we could see them preparing the other dishes and they would tell us what each one was...Goat Cheese Ravioli...awww, yeah!

Here's a tip:  come early so you dont feel so crowded.  The neighborhood fills up fast on a warm summer night!

If you are a CWRU student, I believe they offer you a discount on your meal."}
{"text":"In typical Little Italy style, this place is perfect for dates and pizza and pasta. It's dark and quiet, but could spice up the romance with some candles on the tables. With many Italians working there, it gives it more of an authentic feel and their menu stays true to form. 

Really great pizza! Friendly staff too! I got the fresh mozzarella - Delicious! I'd highly recommend."}
{"text":"Have you ever taken a bite of your food and literally wanted to melt as the taste sensations satisfied everything you were craving? 

Maxi's Ristorante serves up this feeling daily with every authentic and delicious Italian dish they prepare. It's times like these when I ponder how I'm not 380lbs of beastly-ness because, man...I can take down some serious pasta. This is especially true if it's from Maxi's. 

So, you're strolling around Little Italy and you can't figure out where to dine.  Well, I agree. It's truly difficult to pick one restaurant in that neighborhood because they're all great in their own right. BUT, there's just something about Maxi's that keeps me coming back.  It's the food. Specifically the pasta.

My first Maxi's dinner was incredible. There were six of us at a table and we all ordered something different, but all pasta dishes. Everyone shared and with each new bite, it became more difficult to pick a favorite. In the end, I couldn't choose. I know I had the Goat Cheese Ravioli and my sister choose the Penne Pasta Carbonnara. Both were divine. It's literally the most painful experience in the world to watch me try to pick ONE dish to order though. Since the first trip I've added a new favorite to my list, which is the stuffed banana peppers. If I could live off this dish, I would. I'm not kidding. 

There are only a couple of things that bring Maxi's down to a 4 star instead of a 5. The service is just so-so. I'm not the kind of person who likes to be waited on hand and foot, but there's a balance. Our servers always seem to be uninterested and eager to get off work. 

My other issue is the price. I mean, some dishes I can understand a heftier price tag, but pasta dishes $20 and over? Really? It's PASTA. Damn good pasta, but still...I'm not ordering a prime cut of steak here!  Besides, the atmosphere doesn't quite merit that cost either. So, it wouldn't really fall into my \"worth it because it's the whole vibe\" category. It better suits a normal night out for dinner, casual attire, etc. 

I still can't hate on Maxi's though. I mean, their food is just so ridiculously good that it's nearly impossible not to want to spend the money.  I mean, I can even forgive them for the service. All that's forgettable, but the food..well, that's the kind of pasta you dream about."}
{"text":"I thought this place had great service, tasty pizza, and a wonderful patio out back for eating and drinking with friends. I thought the pizza crust was fantastic, and really enjoyed the \"Gina's Pizza' with prosciutto and fresh tomato. Price is slightly on the high side, but it is a relaxing and inviting atmosphere. If there weren't so many places to try I would come back much sooner, yet still imagine I will be back in the not so distant future."}
{"text":"Maxi's is right up the street from me, so I often go because \"it's there.\" But, I have a lot to choose from in that neighborhood and Maxi's is consistently good. Their calamari is fried in the best batter!! If you like dough-y pizza, then you will LOVE Maxi's pizza. I personally prefer crispier crust, but their's is still good. I think I've had every one of their pasta dishes, but the goat cheese raviolis are my favorite. You won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"This was our first time in Little Italy. Our hotel was 1/4 mile away so it wasn't a long walk. After searching menus and reviews on Yelp we settled on Maxi's. We received a nice greeting at the door and were taken to the back patio. Their neighbor two doors down were blasting 80's pop and kinda ruined the atmosphere. The starter was fried mozzarella. It looked odd but tasted great. I ordered spinach ravioli and it was amazing. Husband got pasta Alfredo with chicken. It was also awesome. We were both very happy and very full for our walk back to our hotel. We saw pizza being served at another table and it looked amazing."}
{"text":"I used to love Maxi's when I lived in Cleveland.  I was never disappointed in the food or the service.  I have to say that our experience here yesterday was not as positive as my past ones. 

Although it was a beautiful day and we were able to secure a great little table out front, the rest of our experience was underwhelming.  I will say that our wine, and apps (mussels and bruschetta rustica) were great, everything else, not so much, and especially for the cost.  Our server even took my order and ran away without taking my husbands - very odd.  We had to flag him down to get the rest of the order placed.  The margherita pizza was not as appetizing as I would have hoped for somewhere in Little Italy.  The ravioli that my husband ordered also was comprised of just 4 little pieces. Not exactly filing. 

I remember being able to rave about this place before.  Not anymore.  Will I be back to hope for a better experience?  Probably. I am hoping that this was just a less favorable one time experience only."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Little Italy. The goat cheese ravioli is so creamy and flavorful. The tomato basil salad is a must. We will definitely be back on our next visit to Charlotte"}
{"text":"Incredible food , reminded me of Italy. They nailed it   Would recommend the calamari, stuffed hot peppers, escarole and pizza. Can't go wrong. Great atmosphere especially in the summer with the rear patio. Very accommodating"}
{"text":"Food: the food was great! Dishes picked were Shrimp pasta and Linguini with meatballs. I was expecting the shrimp pasta sauce to be creamier but I did not ask and when it came it was watery. Also, they do not remove the shell on the shrimp tail. Still not sure why places leave those things on when you're putting the shrimp in pasta. Now I have to reach into my pasta and grab the shrimp out with my fingers and eat it to make sure I get every last little yummy bit. The portions were the perfect size and we both left nice and full.

Wine: Underwood pino noir. This is a great red wine that is easy to drink. Very tasty.

Service: refilled our water glasses promptly. Checked in every now and then to make sure we were doing okay. Or waiter made wine recommendations and tried to save us money with a bottle. We only each wanted one glass so we paid the slight extra for wine by the glass.

Decor: We sat on the patio which is full of plastic chairs and tables. They also have a small bar out there, some nice flowers, and umbrellas to keep us pale folk from burning. The interior is nicely decorated with some cool paintings/prints. I'd like to come relax here at the bar and have some pizza and beer with friends some day.

They also had some music playing that made me feel like we were in the motion picture Gatsby."}
{"text":"Although I had a lovely dinner at Maxi's, I don't think that the cost was justified. 

The $16 shrimp pasta with tomatoes, artichokes, capers and a white wine sauce was good, however there were only 4 medium-sized shrimp and the pasta wasn't fresh...I'm not sure what about that meal deserves a $16 price tag. 

Our waiter, who seemed overwhelmed by the full patio, forgot to bring us bread, which was a bit frustrating as we watched every other table around us receive a really good looking bread basket (when we finally requested some, it proved to be crusty and perfect).

I appreciated the heavy handed wine pours, however I likely wouldn't return due to the food prices (come on, $15 calamari?)."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a hard customer when it comes to Italian.  When you're raised on it your whole life, you become a bit discerning.  

While Maxi's had some pluses (awesome butter sauce for bread, good service and the ability to eat there with or without a reservation), it didn't do it for me.  The red sauce was heavy on the basil and my cavatelli was swimming in it.  There was no salad or side to offset the sheer volume of pasta, resulting in a bit of a carby food coma.

I could really take it or leave it.  If someone else was paying, I'd show up.  But with all the other choices in Little Italy, I need more of a reason to pick Maxi's."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about my experience on 2/3/18 for a 25th anniversary dinner party for 18 people. We were on the 2nd floor and our server was phenomenal. Not only was he engaged with our group but he did separate checks. He even made sure we had what we needed for the outside cake we brought. I highly recommend for your next event. Food is always great there. Our group especially enjoyed the calamari."}
{"text":"Hubby's annual birthday surprise began with dinner at Maxi's.

This was our first time here, based on a recommendation from the two friends who dined with us.  We started our meal with a bottle of malbec, and each ordered a different plate of pasta. Thanks to Cara L.'s suggestion, we devoured a savory plate of stuffed banana hot peppers, along with a bowl of steamed mussels.  I could've died happy with those appetizers alone! The only pasta plate that hit a low note for me was their signature sautéed calamari.  I was hoping for non-breaded calamari, but was overwhelmed by the opposite.  It just wasn't what I was expecting, and it had a burnt after-taste.  My friend's sweet alfredo and the other friend's goat cheese ravioli were my favorite.  So much goodness in that cream!

Quaint, festive atmosphere, excellent service.  Pricey, but worth it for a special occasion.

Next time, I'm ordering the frog legs."}
{"text":"Salads were great, I had the mussels which were okay...not the best.  Sauce was sort of flavorless.  Amazing bread. Kind of high priced. If you can't be seated at the sidewalk tables, don't do the \"patio.\" You're basically in a parking lot surrounded by tenements and feral cats.  I think I could have gotten a better Italian dinner in Cleveland...I'd give it another try, though."}
{"text":"I would probably give this place a solid 3 1/2, only reason I bump this place down to athree is that even though it is conveniently located in Little italy, I wasn't impressed with their Feast food.  I do love that they serve Moscato ^_^  and have a patio but this place just didn't hit the spot for me.  I did love the frog legs another time I went, maybe on my next visit, my opinion will go up after really delicious food."}
{"text":"A fantastic restaurant! The pizza, the calamari, the mussels and linguini in red or white wine sauce, the goat cheese ravioli, the frog legs, the... the... EVERYTHING! I've never eaten anything here that was not fabulous. They have a great house wine, friendly, accommodating staff, a master chef, and an inviting and comfortable atmosphere. Best bang for your buck for sure with superb quality and taste! Go here tonight!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service! Just make sure you're not in a rush, this is definitely a sit down place for a nice, long evening with friends or family.

I had the white meatball pizza, and it is to die for! The other meals at my table were the cavatelli with meatballs and chicken piccata, both well received.

Lastly, we got the white peach sangria -- light and tasty on a hot night! Overall, an enjoyable evening dining outside in Little Italy."}
{"text":"We ordered the meatball pizza and it was delicious! The crust and sauce were my favorite part. My boyfriend and I ate the entire 8 slice pizza so obviously we were not disappointed! A glass of rose and Pinot Grigio were great additions! We will definitely be back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Dined while visiting Cleveland this week.  Asked the man who was valet parking our car \"if you were to eat at any of these restaurants here in Little Italy, where would YOU eat\" and he suggested Maxi's so we wandered in the Friday after Christmas. They seemed to be one of the only restaurants on the street that was busy so that was a good sign. They were full downstairs so sat us upstairs with a nice window view of the street with the snow coming down. Excellent Pear Martini made with Gray Goose and ginger, not too sweet, and was delish!  The Calamari was one of the best I've had.  Opted for traditional linguine and meatballs. The sauce was a little too sweet for my liking, but it was good none the less.  Hubby had pasta with carbonara sauce that he devoured!  Affordable but a bit limited wine selection.   Had Tiramasou for dessert, how can that not ever be divine?  Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is they do not offer gluten free pasta selections, which my friend dining with us had to have. They are locals and said most restaurants in the area DO so we were all dissapointed that Maxi's isn't a little more \"with it\" with all of the dietary restrictions so many people have.  Would love to return again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this cute little place on a Sunday and was seated immediately.  I love how this place is family oriented and everyone knew everyone. 

Ambience:  Small, but adorable little place.  Luckily it wasn't crowded when we went in. 

Service:  There was one server running the place and he did a great job.  Didn't bother us too much and was there to refill drinks and ask if everything was okay.  

Food:  I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken.  It was the the best I've ever had.  The chicken was grilled to perfection and the sauce was creamy.  My boyfriend had the 12 oz. strip steak and he said it was very good!

I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a cute date night.  The food is authentic and delicious!  Plus the area is fun to walk around."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Portion were big, and food was absolutely delicious. Linguine with white clams was great and Farfalle with Sausage was just a perfect spicy dish. Very good service too."}
{"text":"Food was a-ok. We ordered bruschetta as an appetizer, which was VERY good. The entrees, however, were just Ike. We had the smoked salmon pizza and meatball dish. The sauce was a lot sweeter than any I've had in an Italian restaurant. The smoked salmon was a little TOO SALTY. All in all, the service was friendly, so if it was a last resort, I'd eat it again"}
{"text":"I had the linguini with meatballs and it was amazing!!! I wanted the recipe but they said it's secret. Darn! So good."}
{"text":"After a lovely recent experience, I know I'll be back at Maxi's - if only because now I MUST order the amazing dishes others in my party got during our visit! 

Their creamy tomato sauce is simply divine as I got to try a bit with my dad's spinach ravioli's (PERFECT) and my sister's penne pasta alla flavia (also delish!)  I was kind of jealous but I couldn't feel too bad with having ordered the veal piccata.  The veal was great and the piccata sauce was very fresh and light with the right lemony acidity and capers for some bite. This dish, as well as my mom's chicken marsala, came with a side of penne in their tomato basil sauce which was fantastic. This sauce lacks the creaminess of the formerly mentioned rock star of a sauce but had a very robust tomato presence without being overly chunky and, perhaps most importantly, very flavorful. The pairing of a meat dish that features sauce with a pasta in a different sauce (albeit in a separate dish), seems a bit weird to me but it was also like I got to try a couple different sauces which is always a bonus!

Service was very nice and we enjoyed ourselves immensely. The dining area is smaller/more intimate and it appears most of the space is taken up by the bar - I bet this place enjoys a fun bit of nightlife!"}
{"text":"It's my favorite  restaurant in Little Italy. The service is really good, even during busy hours, wine selection is very nice, and the food, responsibility of a French chef, is wonderful. Try the Calamari Pasta or the Funghi Pizza, for some real good suggestions. The specials usually great as well."}
{"text":"My main complaint here was this was the first restaurant in little Italy that doesn't offer gluten free pasta. Soooo I asked what they could make gluten free, they gave my a boiled chicken breast smothered in straight lemon juice. 
God awful. 
The service was fine. The staff was friendly. No complaints there."}
{"text":"A must! Each time we visit Little Italy we make it a point to dine here. Great food and very friendly staff that has a high service standard. Nice selection of wine at a fair price. Plan to visit again next trip to Ohio!"}
{"text":"Went to Maxi's on a Friday Night.Ordeted the linguinw with white clam sauce whick turned out to be a tad nabove noodle soup.When I asked why the sauce was runny was told that all of their seafood sauces are like that.Had a very limited dessert menu Rolls mwer vwery hot and were dipped in olive oil.Salad was very good as were the rolls.Was not satisfied with the clam sauce, Service was excellent."}
{"text":"This is my \"must-go\" Italian stop in Cleveland. The Penne Pasta All Flavia is the most perfect pasta dish in existence. For appetizers, we usually opt for the calamari or mussels but some of our friends swear by the frog legs - just not my jam. Pizzas are also great to split and the wine selection is diverse and delicious. 

Also - get event space on the second floor. We had our rehearsal dinner there before our wedding two years ago and people still talk about the chicken marsala that was served family style."}
{"text":"Went here with a party of 5 and even though they were busy and we didn't have reservations we were sat right away.  I had an IPA and a Moretti, the husband had a cocktail and a glass of wine.  We wanted to start with clams, but they were out so we got the mussels instead.  They were good.  I had the Maxi's pizza which had mozzarella, kalamata olives and basil.  The marinara sauce on the pizza was delicious.  The husband had the cavatelli with meatballs, which he ate all of.  I've also been once before and had the shrimp penne which I really enjoyed.  Maxi's is among our 3 favorite LI restaurants."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch. We had calamari, after reading recommendations here. Then pasta carbonara. Great services cae and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Maxis is a cute little old school Italian place in Little Italy. I came here for a few appetizers. We got the fried mozzarella in the marinara sauce and the fried calamari

The calamari was ok, I have had it from here before and it was significantly better. I enjoyed the fried mozzarella, it was super fresh and the breading was yummy. The marinara sauce was good and we dipped the bread rolls into that. The problem could have been that the food sat for a while before being brought to us even though we were sitting at the bar 15 feet from the kitchen window. 

Overall I'm not very impressed. It was ok and it's my friends favorite place but I won't come back my myself. Plus the price for the 2 appetizers was $29, kind of pricey."}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience. 5 star food, and that's what really matters"}
{"text":"First time we've tried this place.  I would definitely come back.  The calamari appetizer was excellent.  Salads were nice.  I had the spinach ravioli, my wife had the goat cheese ravioli.  Both were excellent; the sauces were particularly good.  The server was pleasant, if slightly inattentive.  It was a little on the pricey side.  Nice ambiance though.  As I said, I would come back."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place - and admittedly everything we had was delicious (pizza, pasta, the hot peppers - beware! really hot) but the service was pretty awful. It was slow and the waiter took nearly 15 minutes to bring us waters, and still came back a few minutes later to take our drink orders, which then took about another 10 minutes to come out. I'm also not a fan of restaurants that do happy hour \"only at the bar\" like they do. We came in with a big group and could not get happy hour pricing because it was \"only at the bar\". Great food, disappointing service."}
{"text":"I'm not the sort to go out of my way to write a negative review. A restaurant can have a bad day, and sometimes things just happen. I get that.

That said, I came in here on a 90+ degree day for lunch. The place was a sauna, maybe hotter inside than outside. I don't know how a restaurant like this - a small space where the kitchen heat easily transfers to the dining room - doesn't install an A/C. The ceiling fans did nothing to offset the heat, and so I was left sweating buckets. The best part? Every now and again my table would get a nice whiff of skunk odor. Nothing like ungodly heat and skunk to put you in the mood for some Italian.

The food itself? Meh. The bread was tasty, the meatballs okay, but the pasta and sauce? I'd have been better off making my own at home. It would have tasted better, I wouldn't have to suffer an inferno to eat it, and it wouldn't have cost $70 for three before tip.

I should note none of my issues are with the service itself. Our waiter was great, the hostess attentive. But everything else made me wish I had waited until 5pm for Etna to open. On a street with so many Italian restaurants, I can't think why you would ever go here."}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice local place for lunch. Came across this gem and absolutely loved it. Great outdoor patio and the best marinara sauce!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious, authentic, and awesome for Italian food! I had a chocolate espresso martini to start off with and it was heavenly. The appetizers I tried were fried cheese, caprese salad, and calamari. All of them were ridiculously good. For dinner, I had lobster pasta, which was really rich and tasty. This place is also known for its pizza, but sadly I was too full to try any. Love the location in little Italy too!"}
{"text":"MMMMMMMM! Finally got to go back to Maxi's at a time that wasn't during The Feast! Calamari Pasta and Funghi Pizza were just as I remembered... So delicious! My sister and I were able to sit outside in the front, which is great for people watching if you don't mind the traffic.

Service was okay, and the outdoor seating is a little squished. But all that was forgotten considering the heavenly food we were eating."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their happy hour menu is amazing! Pizza, calamari, and mussels are delicious! Their martinis are nice and strong and they are very generous with their wine pours. Their staff is also super friendly!"}
{"text":"My housemate, his brother, and I were in the mood for some pizza and we stopped by Maxi's because of their solid reviews. We ordered the Funghi pizza and pepperoni pizza to share and boy were they delicious! The first was light, not really greasy, and very well seasoned. The latter was well seasoned as well and all you want in a pepperoni pizza! We'll definitely have to come back to try the pasta and their dishes! Defiantly check it out! 

Btw. The sangria (white wine) was quite delicious! Not too sweet and full of flavors!"}
{"text":"We went down to Little Italy this weekend for the art walk, After walking around for a bit we decided it was dinner time and wanted to eat outside. Always wanting to try new places we decided on Maxis. Service was a little off but overall a good experience. we were seated at a table right next to the entrance so a lot of movement going on for my add. Food was very good, and for the price you got a good deal. I had the clams pasta which had about 10 little necks in it, and very soft pasta, a favorite of mine but something you dont really see in this part of town. My fiance had the goat cheese ravioli. Also very tasty. Wine prices were good and overall a decent experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Authentic Italian fare. Had the shrimp and pasta and it was excellent.  Impressed me with the use of capers and fresh basil. Gave 4 stars because the decor was too boring and lighting was too bright. Dim it down a little."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant in Little Italy! The staff is friendly, accomadating and always treat us as family. We are happy whenever we go here. Love every dish that the staff and Chef Gilbert prepare it's always sensational. Try the Calmari--it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great food, service was great AFTER the bar tender realized my friend I was dining with (who was visiting from Trinidad) wasn't there to rob the place.  Spicy sausage pasta was right on.  Pizza was right on...but you could cut the racism with a knife.

FYI to the staff...not every black person is trying to case your bar or hold the place up."}
{"text":"Easy, warm, and cozy.  Nice wines and food is very good. Calamari is a must. Salad was a miss for $10 but everything else rocked.  Papardelle w/bolognese was joyous and meatballs didnt disappoint.   Ill be back"}
{"text":"On a weeknight, you don't have to worry about paying for street parking, which is a plus. I actually parked on the street right in front of the restaurant, since the valet parking signs were only valid for Friday through Sunday. I must not have been violating any parking signs since the police parked across the street didn't ticket or tow! =)

I started with the mixed mesclun ($7), since pasta entrees do not come with a salad, and there is no side salad portion. This is big enough for two people. I thought some of the greens were a wilted and old but I was hungry. I did like how the salad was a bit salted. Personally, I don't salt salad, but it was a nicely added flavor since these greens can be slightly bitter. 

For an entree, I ordered the calamari pasta ($18). It's my mistake for not realizing the pasta contained escarole instead of just calamari and marinara sauce. I personally am not a fan of escarole since it has a bitter taste, but I ate as much as possible. I picked out the greens, and the pasta tasted great. The calamari was hands down, probably one of the best cooked calamari I've had since going to Greece. It was lightly breaded (not too much, not too little), and it was the perfect texture. Calamari can easily be rubbery, but this was the melt-in-your-mouth kind.

I would've given three stars for the food and ease of parking, but my stomach became upset as SOON as I returned to my hotel and the condition was on and off the rest of the night. I very rarely get stomach upsets (given how much I travel), but I did this time. So, two stars (meh, I've experienced better) it is!"}
{"text":"Maxi's was a solid eatery but 3 stars for the price:value of the restaurant.

Staff: waitress was super friendly.  There on a Saturday night, had a reservation (which was key, it was packed), but the bar service was a bit slow.

Food: appetizers were very good to excellent, we ordered the frog legs, calamari and burratta and enjoyed everything.  We shared 1 pasta (which was an excellent creamy/spicy/tomato sauce) and 2 pizzas.  Restaurant was known for pizza so perhaps there was too much hype, but I found them to be just OK.

Ambiance: small but cozy restaurant scene. 

Prices: everything is pretty expensive, although to be expected for the prime location in Little Italy.  To me, the prices were a bit higher than food warranted.  

Visiting tip: check out dessert at one of the two local bakeries, they are both a block away and open late (~10pm)"}
{"text":"I like never leave a 1 star review. It takes a lot for me to drop a business that low but I felt like I was hit over my head and robbed. The service was average for me. Nothing spectacular but not horrible either. My coworker who asked for salt and pepper and never received it may beg to differ but for me this 1 star rating is more deserving for their goat cheese ravioli. Don't order it unless you are fine with paying $4 per ravioli only the size of a silver dollar. You will not be full and it was not good enough to justify paying $12 for a 3 ravioli lunch entree or even $16 for the 4 ravioli dinner entree. This is the most undersized portion I have ever seen in a restaurant and should be sold more as an appetizer at a fraction of the cost. 3 of us ordered this and none of us were happy. I won't be going back because I feel that I have already been robbed enough. Don't go!! If you do, don't order the ravioli unless you are fine with still being hungry after and paying $4 for each little ravioli. I would've rather have bought a can of Chef Boyardee for a fraction of what you pay per ravioli when your break down the pricing on this entree. Will it be as good for you since it's processed and full of chemicals? Obviously not but at least you won't feel starved and robbed. Never again!!! No thanks!!"}
{"text":"Maxi's is my favorite restaurant in Little Italy! If you want great Italian food in a comfortable atmosphere this is the place to be. Their calamari is easily the best you can find in Cleveland (not over fried and dried out like most places). I love the pizzas also- the \"Little Italy\" pizza is my personal favorite because I love spicy food. There's no where else where you can get unique things to try like tripe (which is delicious) and frog legs (which taste like chicken) and also get all the classic Italian pastas and pizzas you could ask for. I also recommend the stuffed hot peppers- so good! The service is always excellent and I've yet to have a subpar experience."}
{"text":"I don't make it out to little italy often but I have been to this gem twice now. Tucked away in little Italy, you will truly fine nothing less than authentic Italian cuisine here. 

The inside is tiny but cozy, not the most romantic atmosphere but still enjoyable because it's so small. The first time we came here the server had a little accident and spilled four sangrias all over our table and us. We laughed it off because it was his first week and assured him we would be back. When we came back last night, guess who was our server and who remembered us? The charming funny sangria spiller! He truly was awesome and I hope he waits on us again, despite the first mishap. After a few laughs we quickly ordered more sangria ( haha) and the best calamari in cleveland. 


Seriously this calamari kicks ass. It taste so fresh and is ever so lightly fried and sits atop a sauce a want to bathe in. Us four girls split the cavitelli and meatballs, chicken piccata and the shrimp scampi special. The meatballs were fabulous like they always are (we ordered double) but the shrimp scampi was the standout. The piccata was forgettable but still okay. We finished off our meal by splitting two cannolis (two come in an order) and it was the perfect sweet ending to the meal, do not miss these!


The only reasons I can't give five stars is because of the atmosphere and the price. I know that it's little Italy but for a round of sangria, calamari, three pasta dishes we easily dropped $150. Nonetheless, I know I won't be able to stay away."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Maxi's in Little Italy. From the moment we walked in the door the staff was friendly and tentative. The prices are fairly reasonable - around $16 bucks for a pizza to share and appetizer ranging from $8-20. We tried the Escargot (what an interesting appetizer)! A great cocktail menu and an awesome wine selection! Definitely recommend for you to try if you are ever in Little Italy."}
{"text":"I can't say there was anything wrong with our meal or service but I just wasn't impressed. The entrees include three veal dishes (which I don't eat) and three chicken dishes (and a steak). Was hoping for more variety. This place should definitely be $$$ unless you're getting a pizza which looked good. Dining room is small, we sat on back patio which was okay until a thunderstorm sent everyone scrambling into the restaurant with nowhere to sit. The chicken piccata and clams pasta both had decent flavor but the portions seemed small for the price. Usually when I eat bread (which was excellent), a salad, and an entree I am either very full or taking some home. I should have ordered a pizza for the road but the chaos from the storm had the staff a bit frazzled."}
{"text":"Well I didn't expect the greatest pizza from this place but at least I expect them to serve freshly baked fresh dough, not a frozen dough pizza.

Frozen dough pizza is totally unacceptable (like a sin) for a place where they claim that they are Italian. I could simply go to a grocery store and buy frozen pizza. 

So mediocre! Won't come back"}
{"text":"I was in town with some family and we popped into this little joint on a low key Tuesday afternoon. Almost everything we had was amazing!  Appetizer: mozzarella and tomato basil - how can you go wrong? it was great!  The 4 of us split all of our entrees so we could all samp!  Dish One: Spinach Ravioli (3 came to a dish)-- it was decent! Dish Two: Italian sausage and peppers-- soo good but you better be ready for some spice! When we walked in that is all we smelled in the restaurant so we definitely wanted to order the sausageeeee! it was very flavorful! Dish Three: The Flavella (sp?) was excellent according to the rest of the table - I did not try it. Dish Four: Pepperoni Pizza - it was mediocre. I was expecting more to be honest so I would not recommend.

Overall, great little joint! I would return !"}
{"text":"Maxi's is a good choice if your trying to decide which restaurant to go to in Cleveland's Little Italy. Food and service was great. We went off a previous Yelp review regarding the Calamari appetizer and we are glad we did... VERY GOOD! My boyfriend had the Chicken Picatta, which was delicious and I ordered the Ravioli w/ goat cheese..also delicious. My only complaint about the restaurant is we sat in the back where they had the TV on which didn't meld so well with the music playing overhead."}
{"text":"Excellent, very small restaurant but what great food! The sauce on the chicken Piccata was outstanding! Parking places are very scarce."}
{"text":"After a busy day at UHC, we were ready for pizza and drinks.  Maxi's was a short walk away and did not disappoint.  They have a solid selection of martinis, other cocktails, wine, and beer.  I had a glass of the chianti - they offer a very generous glassful of wine.  As I sipped the stress of the work day away with my chianti, my friend enjoyed his Manhattan Transfer - tasted just like a strong Manhattan.
Many of the pizza offerings sounded delicious - lots of veggie offerings.  We went with Gina's pizza - a white pizza with prosciutto and tomatoes (no ricotta).  It was very simple and we enjoyed every last bite.  
I also had a mixed green salad with balsamic vinagrette - it's a nice mix of greens but lacked additional toppings - cucumbers, tomatoes would have been a nice addition.  The vinagrette was strong.
Service was OK.  It wasn't busy.  The server forgot to bring me my salad so when the pizza came out and I reminded him about the salad, he gave it to me free of charge.
Other reviews mention bread.  We weren't offered bread."}
{"text":"I got the Veal Scallopini Piccata. I really enjoyed it, good serving size and very tasty. The restaurant wasn't very busy, but it was a weekday night. Very dark inside, wish it had slightly better lighting so I could see my food better"}
{"text":"So we just stopped by for an after dinner drink, and I was so impressed I HAD to write a review. This place seemed pretty lively for 9 pm when the restaurants were mostly wrappin up so we stopped in.

Wow. Here's what impressed me. The wine pours! They literally give you a goblet of wine! It's like a half a bottle! Impressive.

Oh yeah. And we took a pizza to go and it was fabulous - even reheated!"}
{"text":"Four of us went here for lunch yesterday.  We ate on the outside patio and it was fun to people watch.  We ordered The little Italy pizza pie and The Gilberts Pizza with no proschiutto which were delicious.  The little Italy pizza had a nice kick to it and The Gilberts had lots of ricotta cheese.  These pizzas were enough to serve four hungry appetites.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I took my mom out to lunch on a bright Saturday and walked around Little Italy. This place seemed about good as any so we decided to give it a try. The lunch menu was reasonably priced. I think the pasta was around $10. She had the italian sausage and farfalle pasta. I had the meatballs. Both were good. My mom does not so much enjoy spicy foods and the sauce of her dish had a slight kick to it. I enjoyed both dishes. We opted to split the tomato, basil and mozzerella salad. It was the perfect amount to split and serve as an appetizer. The server was a really nice guy. He seemed genuine and not full of it. Not apathetic and not overbearing. It was a nice place to go for lunch. Hopefully I will one day return. En'shallah."}
{"text":"We came for the calamari and stayed for the good food and drink, the comfortable atmosphere and friendly wait staff. Calamari was tender and tasty although we might have preferred it crispier. Four seasons pizza was excellent. We ordered $8 glass of Italian red wine which was very good for the price. Also tried a craft beer with odd flavor. When waiter asked we told him and he immediately removed and replaced it with a complimentary beer. This does never happen at a franchise place and is one reason to liked this family business in Cleveland little Italy. I would come back."}
{"text":"My first and only visit has left me completely unimpressed. Had Cavatelli and meatballs for lunch. For $12 I got served two tiny meatballs barely the size of a half dollar. Cavatellis were cooked just right, but the sauce reminded me of Chef Boyardee Spaghetti-O's and with very little body. There are much better restaurants around Little Italy that deliver better flavor and value."}
{"text":"Sign says open. Site says till 11. Very rude told they were closed with 30 minutes before advertised closing time. Seven people turned away. Poor business model. Good luck with the attitude small time
Players"}
{"text":"Although I initially intended to try Mia Bella, I am extremely happy that we were instead able to eat outdoors at Maxi's! The ambiance and energy of the cozy neighborhood is so nice to find in any city.  But more importantly the service and good was EXCELLENTE! I could not get enough of the roasted garlic that adorned the crispy, succulent frog legs.  The pizza and pasta was amazing.  Next time I am in Ohio I will be back! Gratzi!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Traditional Italian dishes. A little expensive. Pizza is covered in lots of sauce so beware."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Little Italy.  The food reminds me of what my mom cooked.  
My family and I have been making it out meeting place for Christmas Eve dinner for the past few years, and have a great time every year.  We walk out of there full of food and drinks, and will talk about it for the next year.  
My favorite dishes are the bruschetta, the pizzas and the cavatelli and meatballs.  I have heard they have great frog legs and calamari."}
