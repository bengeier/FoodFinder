{"text":"Had one of the most memorable meals of my life.   We ordered the tasting menu, and each and every dish was better than the next. Some of the combinations sounded a little peculiar to me at first, like the morrel mushrooms and caramel... but I was blown away.  Sitting at the bar we were able to chat with the bartender who really took the time to explain the wines to us and let us try some rather unique options. The staff were all really friendly, and we even got the chance to chat to the owner and the chef towards the end of the night.  If you are lucky you might be able to try their off-the-menu PBJ sandwich.   Well worth a visit, the prices were incredibly reasonable and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food great staff and the best sour dough bread  i've ever had. You can buy one if there are any available"}
{"text":"While I had read a lot of reviews about this restaurant, nothing prepared me for how good it actually was.  I loved everything, from the part of town it's in, the subtle signage and entrance to the space, and the simple approach to the delicious menu.  Unless you have the appetite of a sparrow, choose the larger 'menu' and add the wine pairing (the three wines we had last night were all excellent and we would not have chosen then on our own so it was nice to be introduced to something new).  Our dinner consisted of tiny Vietnamese spring rolls with a dab of chicken pate, The Most Inventive beet salad ever (there is no way I can described the preparation), Atlantic halibut with morels, asparagus with rhubarb, lamb and avocado purée, a creamsicle with what tasted like a side of sunshine (!) and a unexpected tiny croissant with white chocolate snow and Thai basil.  Simple outstanding and absolutely not heavy-handed flavours. (Only downside to our experience was that the small room is noisy.) Many thanks to the team at Le Fantome for a lovely evening and for accommodating a time change when our flight was late into Montreal."}
{"text":"Le Fantome deserves all the many accolades it has been receiving and more. I've been 3 times, each meal better than the last.   The change to a tasting menu is a welcomed addition as it gives Chef Jason the opportunity to take you on a culinary journey, playing with flavors and textures while respecting each ingredient. He certainly lives up to his recent award of \"Jeune talent de l'année\" by Gault et Millau.   Kabir commands the front of house with poise, approachability and a great knowledge of the food and impressive wine list. Whether it's the fixed wine pairing or simply a recommended glass or bottle, the wine I've had with my meals has always complemented and enhanced the experience.  I can't recommend this restaurant highly enough and will certainly be back many more times"}
{"text":"Le nirvana des papilles gustatives...  Excellent accord des saveurs, chaque services étaient une exaltation.  Décor sobre au goût du jours, ambiance intime.  Service hors pair, personnel très professionnel.  À découvrir, j'ai été impressionné.  Hautement recommandé."}
{"text":"This was the 101st place that I tried in Montreal & it stands out among the best. It was outstanding from the gnocchi course to the lamb, the desserts, the tartare, and especially the service. Already thinking of an excuse to return  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This review strictly pertains to the peanut butter jam and foie gras sandwich.   It is that good and then some. The toasted bread is soft like brioche bread, it really melts in your mouth, jam and pb are well balanced and then the foie gras hits you and you're like wow, mama said don't be naughty but I couldn't help it... lol   As for the tasting menu and the staff, um what they said yeah :)"}
{"text":"We came here as a family of 5 and absolutely loved it! The food was delicious and exciting and the service was great. We highly recommend ordering as many plates as possible to share as it allows you to taste the full breadth of the menu. The ambience is fun and lively and the venue is cozy and well decorated. Very highly recommended and we look forward to returning!  Thanks for a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"The hype is hard to fully understand.   The food tastes good- on par with other restaurants of this genre in Montreal. But the value for money is among the worst in the city.    The dishes are pretentiously - almost belligerently - small.   Because each dish was like less than 100g.   That sandwich might have been like 10 g or something.  I'm actually serious.   The 'courses' are legit cocktail food and sometimes not even. The halibut was maybe one inch cubed, with maybe 1/6th of a portobello; one course was a salad that was maybe 1/6 of cup of marinated veg.   Please see the image of the microscopic grilled cheese, which was one 'course', with one 'sandwich' per person. Factor that into the cost of the meal.   Maybe it is worse than it used to be- the photos up there look much more reasonable than what we had.  $75 = $45 menu + 1 beer (600ml) each.  We were still basically hungry.    They offered us the 'top up' menu, which is unsurprisingly rather popular.  We laughed out loud.  They graciously threw us some leftover carbs at the end of the night (breadx1 plus maybe 50g of pasta) which is the only thing that prevented us from going home for late night snacks afterwards. They threw in an extra dessert too at the end of the night b/c other wise they would have to toss it.   They seemed nervous about it honestly.   Because they THEY KNOW the food is too small. It's part of the business model. The described our $45 dollar tasting menu as 'the snack'. Guys no.  No one wants to spend that much on a snack, plus wine and tax and tip. Unless there are psychoactive substances involved."}
{"text":"This is an unsung great find tucked into up and coming Griffintown.  The hospitality, creativity of dishes, and wine list separates this resto from many other popular more centric Montreal haunts.  They are probably tired of making it.  But the PB&J foie gras sandwiches were the best things I ate on my four day trip. And that is after eating at the fantastic Au Pied du Cochon and the severely overrated Joe Beef.  Do not miss."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I've had all year. This is a tasting menu gastronomy type restaurant, so if you're in the mood for your traditional montreal tartare that you find on every menu in the city, do not come here!   As soon as we walked in we right away felt at home. The setting is charming and welcoming and so is the staff who takes pride in the food that they serve to their clients.   We selected the 8 course meal which was executed to perfection, each delicious course came out in a timely manner which made the entire experience even better.  The fish we had was absolutely delicious and we ended the main course run with a beautiful lamb piece that was cooked to perfection. Mon coup de cur: a creamy pasta inspired asparagus plate which was like nothing I've ever had. Combine that to a beautiful wine list - we were in a happy place.   To finish off a white chocolate croissant. Délicieux.   5's across the board. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Restaurant excellent. très belle surprise! On a prit le menu neuf services et chaque plat était une explosion de saveurs. Recherché, audacieux et savoureux. Le service quant à lui est parfait. Chaque plat est accompagné d'une mise en bouche descriptive qui vous fera saliver avant de succomber. À essayer les yeux fermés!"}
{"text":"Un resto qui vient clairement de se placer dans mon top 3 des meilleurs restaurants à Montréal!!! J'ai adoré mon experience !! Nous avons pris le menu dégustation et c'était malade dans la tête !!! Nous allons retourner à cet endroit cest certain ! Le service etait extra et l'endroit est juste trop cool !"}
{"text":"I ate here the other night and left hungry even though I ordered the larger tasting menu. I had to have a snack when I got home, and I'm just a small lady...big guys must leave here starving! The food itself was delicious, though.   The service was okay; our waitress was efficient but not particularly warm (not a crime, but makes for a less fun meal when there is no rapport). As other reviewers have pointed out, they do not accommodate guests if one person at the table wants the smaller tasting menu (my friend who was denied the smaller menu probably dodged a bullet though because, as I said, the portions are not particularly generous).   Ambiance is nice---dark and moody with lots of candles. Good date spot. That being said, I probably will not be back...there are so many places in town where a perfect meal is guaranteed. Why risk it?"}
{"text":"This place was generally really good, but I have a hard time understanding the degree of hype surrounding it. Don't get me wrong, there was clearly a lot of thought put into the food and service. The menu was exciting and some things were really delicious- but I can't say that the meal my group had was as stupendously awesome as some of the reviews here claim, especially since the cut of steak I ordered was a bit unimaginative and came overcooked. Perhaps it was an off night, but I don't think it's worth a second shot."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I had the tasting menu and was treated to some of the best food i have ever had. I would mention that all the staff helped me and im also terrible with names but THEY ARE SPECTACULAR! Super knowledgeable and personable. Come here and treat yourself to a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Menu is constantly evolving everyday based on what's available. Choose the full set menu and sit back and and enjoy the ride."}
{"text":"Recently had a chance to try out this place with a group of friends and was really impressed! As soon as one walks into the resto,  one can't help but marvel at the stunning gothic like decor. The resto itself is small and the lighting is very dark with it's candlelit tables but perfect for creating a mystical gothic ambiance. Service was warm and friendly. We had the tasting menu which allowed us to taste a little bit of their delicious unique dishes. Although the portions are small , it's enough to sample all the amazing chef's creations!  From the artic char to the orrechhetti pasta and the Peanut butter foie gras sandwich ...everything was delicious. Would definately recommend to try at least once for the unique dining experience!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! We had to wait 15 minutes for a table even though we made reservations. We were offered and given a glass of champagne as well as another glass of wine while we waited. Such a nice touch! Food was impeccable. Will be back!"}
{"text":"On a aimé le menu proposé, assez inventif et avec des jeux de textures agréables. L'accord mets-vin était bon sauf pour le dernier met où le vin servi était plutôt en dissonance avec la dinde et \" sa \" canneberge, d'ailleurs c'était le plat le moins bien réussi. Et le service a été efficace, cordial et courtois."}
{"text":"Not impressed! Made reservation online. Table was confirmed. 5 minutes later I got a phone call letting me know that they had given my table to someone who booked over the phone :("}
{"text":"What a lovely date I had here, I would gladly be back and recommend it to others.   I'll start by answering some questions I had before coming here in case anyone is wondering the same things: when I ate at Le Fantôme, the tasting menu was $69 and had 6 services. I didn't ask for details but from the way the waitress presented it, I got the feeling the number of services and price can vary a little bit since the menu is not always the same. And the tasting menu is the only option there is. Also, individually the services may appear small, but in the end my boyfriend and I were totally satisfied and stuffed.  As others have mentioned, the food is amazing. Our tasting menu had a nice variety of food, it included fried morcels, seafood, pasta, fish, beef and obviously dessert. The service was equally wonderful and attentive. The dishes were always nicely explained, sometimes even with a bit of humour which made the evening quite pleasant.   Definitely a great place to try!"}
{"text":"Amazing tasting menu. Super friendly staff, every course was perfect. Only complaint was the people photographing every plate as it came out, and face timing their kids. Not the time or place for that, but totally not the restaurant's fault.   The sous vide lamb shoulder was unreal, the pasta not far behind..."}
{"text":"If you are someone who likes to try multiple dishes and you are someone who is willing to trust the chef. Check out Fantome.  The night we dined there, they had 10 courses of 3-5 bites each. There was no menu.  I usually find when I get a chef's choice that there will be a few hits and a few misses. On this occasion, every dish was a hit.   I thought it was great they offered a non-alcoholic pairing with the meal, for those who do not drink (and I have more and more friends who have chosen to stop drinking, or perhaps are simply driving and still want a pairing). I was tempted, but still went with the wine pairing.  I was a little surprised by 4 pairings with 10 dishes, but in the end was satisfied with the quality and quantity of the pairings.  We did add an order of the peanut butter and jelly foie gras sandwich because... well seriously, how could we skip that? Quite rich, but tasty and that is the one item that is always on the menu (much to the chefs chagrin, since they prefer to be creative :) so you may get a PBJ Foie gras sandwich with a twist depending on the night)  Any downsides? well if you are looking for craft cocktails, go elsewhere, they have a very limited menu.  Our waitress seemed wasn't unfriendly, but she wasn't really warm and welcoming, which surprised me a bit since it was a quiet night and we sat at the bar, but by mid meal we were having a lively and fun chat with the owner.   If you just want tasty food and don't want to make any decisions, then this is a great little spot!"}
{"text":"While the staff was super friendly and the ambiance was great, the portion sizes were incredibly small and we were not very impressed with the taste. The first course, the blueberry dish was a single blueberry with an extreme vinegar taste. The second dish, a peach dish was OK- nothing special about it. The corn risotto was nice and the eggplant entree was also good. The dessert very tarty, and not to my liking. But there is nothing I would go back for. The worst part was that after dishing out almost 200 CAD, we wanted to get pizza afterwards because we were left hungry. I must however, note that they were very vegetarian friendly- which is rare for these types of restaurants."}
{"text":"Le Fantome is a quiet and small venue that you'd probably miss if you were walking around in Griffintown; it is only recognizable by the triangular logo on the door so you'd probably miss the door or walk into the pub next door as many diners did that night. The interior is dark and decorated with warm candles and beautiful art on the walls, adding to the secrecy and mystery of this place which legend has it, is haunted by the headless apparition of Mary Gallagher who was murdered in 1879.  The restaurant offers a 7 course tasting menu at 65$ and a wine pairing at 50$. My party and I opted for both and can attest that we all loved it! The menu, which changes by season, offers an eclectic array of small portioned dishes which were all skillfully prepared and wonderfully delicious. The plates were a perfect combination of textures and flavours; a creative and playful menu that was perfectly proportioned and well priced. Fun fact: all our dishes were served on dishes made by chef's Jason Morris' mom! The wine pairing was wonderful and really enhanced our dinning experience and I highly recommend it!   The service was flawless; attentive and cordial, the wait staff took care of all the details, carefully explaining all dishes as they were served simultaneously our party of 8. A perfect evening indeed!"}
{"text":"Incredible restaurant. With amazing service. The food is exquisite. Very diverse offering and high-quality. Setting is  very cosy and subtle. Maybe a little bit noisy, but definitely worth it.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best risotto, duck and flan I ever had.  The internationally trained Chef is incredibly innovative.  He reminds me of the legendary Marc Veyrat."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant - one of the best I've visited in Montreal. It's only been open for a few weeks, and will soon become very popular I'm sure.   I dined with a couple of colleagues, and between us, we tried everything on the menu.   The focus is on local, fresh and high quality foods.  Frankly, every dish was amazing and it's hard to call out anything in particular.  Having said that, the foie gras was out of this world, as were the duck and steak dishes.  He chef was able to combine flavours that are not normally seen in an extremely effective and super tasty way.   The service was also very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable.  They recommended great wines to accompany our meal, and went to great lengths to ensure we enjoyed everything.   It's a fairly small restaurant, with a great ambience.   I'll definitely be back, and recommend this place to anyone who wants to try something a little different and is big on taste and flavour."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience for our 6 year anniversary! The service was impeccable and each dish was delicious. The plates were thoughtfully crafted and each bite had an explosion of flavor! The restaurant is very small and dark with melted candles as decor - this contributed to our romantic night! We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Très contente d'avoir essayé ce restaurant ! Une super découverte qui se classe très certainement dans mon top 5 d'endroits préférés! Leur menu est tout simplement fantastique! Les goûts sont au rendez-vous, la fraîcheur des aliments aussi, c'est parfait de A à Z !   Laissez-vous gâter avec une sandwich peanut butter et foie gras, vous allez CAPOTER !   Bref, si vous aimez vous gâter et aimez payer pour un bon restaurant, je vous le recommande ! C'est un incontournable!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I booked our St-Valentine's day supper here on Saturday the 13th.  We were incredibly excited to try this restaurant because we had heard great and seemingly unanimous comments.  We were very disappointed, to say the least.    There was a $60 set menu per person which seemed to be interesting and a great mix.  We loved the concept of small dishes because we were always excited for the next one.  We each took a wine pairing for $40 extra.    The plates were nice but nothing extraordinary.  The portions were very small.  There were about 7 servings. For dessert, both plates were small and were to be shared between the two of us.    We left there feeling extremely hungry!  We actually ended up going to McDonalds to grab a burger because we were that hungry... And I am honestly not a big eater and have never before still felt hungry after going to a restaurant.  For $275 for two people (taxes and tip in), it was definitely not worth it.  There are plenty of other places in Montreal which offer better quality food at a much more reasonable price.  However, I have to say that the service was amazing.  They also gave all fo the ladies a rose at the end of the meal, which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"I went to Le Fantôme last night with 2 friends. The atmosphere was interesting and the service good, but the food, while good, wasn't very creative or exciting and the unpleasant surprise of a \"fixed experience\" and the portion size left us underwhelmed.   THE ATMOSPHERE: Blackout blinds, dark walls, bare concrete pillars and a mass of melted candles set the tone as you enter the dimly-lit restaurant. The decor evokes an industrial grotto, or perhaps a trendy dungeon. House music plays in the background at a very reasonable volume.  THE SERVICE: The waitstaff are attentive and know the menu well. The interactions are more cold than friendly, but the food and drinks are brought promptly.  THE FOOD: The menu is a fixed tasting menu with two options: small tasting menu (6 course 45$) or the full tasting menu (8 course, 60$), with the possibility of adding the signature foie gras peanut butter jelly sandwich (PBFGJ - 15$) which they recommend to be split between a few people. Our biggest issue came when we wanted to order: we were told we all had to order the same menu. We thought this was a joke and 1 person in our party who was less hungry tried to order the small menu, and we were told this was impossible. We argued that each person should be allowed to order in accordance to their level of hunger, but they went on to explain that this was against their philosophy that everybody should be served at the same time. I don't know about you, but I've never felt upset at a restaurant when another person got more food then me. They remained inflexible on this, and so we all opted for the small tasting menu, but we ordered different things and got to sample every dish on the menu.  Other reviewers have done a better job than I of finding adjectives to describe the portion size (minuscule, microscopic, insultingly small). The staff know the portions are small, and even let us know we would not be leaving the restaurant full, even with the $60 tasting menu. Here is the food I got, along with the approximate portion size to give you an idea of how small they are.  -Foie nem -- 15g This amuse-bouche was a tiny spring roll, tasted mostly of the lettuce in it; nothing exciting here.   -Beet salad, with creme fraiche and shaved Italian truffles -- 35g Tasty, nice presentation of yellow and red beets, but nothing new.  -Charcoal-grilled lobster with kombu sauce -- 40g Most creative dish of the night, but a bit underseasoned and the lobster took on an undesirable sooty flavour from the charcoal.  -Shaved asparagus al dente in butter -- 75g Best dish of the night for me. Simple, fresh and perfectly seasoned.   -Poached halibut with BC morels -- 100g This dish arrived slightly cold. The fish was perfectly cooked, but the sauce it came with was rather thin and left the dish lacking in depth.   -PBFGJS -- 200g Another great dish, split three ways and shared between us. The homemade brioche and the intersection of salty, sweet, and fatty make this a decadent and delicious dish. Compared to the rest of the menu, this is both the largest portion and the most reasonably priced option.   -Salted chocolate mousse with dehydrated crepes and chanterelle mushrooms -- 100g I personally liked this dish, though the rest of my group did not. I liked the saltiness of the mousse and the delicate texture of the chanterelle mushrooms.  For what it's worth, we ended up going for burgers and fries after leaving.  OVERALL: This isn't the only restaurant that serves tiny portions of foods with fancy ingredients and you probably get what you pay for. What really ruined the experience for us was the fact we weren't allowed to order what we wanted. It seems absurd to us and ruined the experience the restaurant seemingly cares so much about. The restaurant has potential but, given the price point, wouldn't be on the top of my list of places to try."}
{"text":"We had an excellent evening at Le Fantome.   My husband and I had dinner there with another couple. Even though we have different tastes and appetites, the four of us loved it. We all took the 8-course tasting menu and it was well portioned and outstanding.   The timing between courses was perfect (we never felt rushed or forgotten), the setting is done in good taste and feels welcoming, the wines we tried were top-notch (we didn't do the pairing), the staff were friendly and discreet (we maintained conversation through eight plate clearings without feeling interrupted), and, most importantly, the food was delightful.    We'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Came here on a last minute whim with my girlfriends. Ideal place for a no worries night out as there is only two choices on the menu. Either the full 7 course tasting menu or the lighter 5 courses.   Overall we had a pleasant time. The service was excellent, the food was innovative and they have a great wine list with many bio choices. The menu changes frequently so I can't recommend a specific dish as it probably won't be there by the time you go, but I can say that all were well executed. The quality of the produce is outstanding and seasoning on par. My only critique would be that the portion sizes could be a bit larger. We were 4 girls and none of us left feeling full. Mind you, we didn't leave hungry but that feeling of complete satisfaction you get after a perfectly sized meal just wasn't there.   Another tip: If you like wine, I'd go for their individuals bottles instead of the 30$ wine pairing option. The wine pairing was 3 glasses, so 1 glass for every two services and not full pours. So it wasn't really a wine pairing experience in my books and we ended up having to order another full bottle between the 4 of us as the pours were just not generous enough."}
{"text":"4.5/5 if I could give half point increments  Food - Amazing, just look at the pics (menu and wine list as well)  Wine - Superb pairing, my buddy polished off a glass before the second dish arrived and the waitress topped him off a little, now that's service!  Decor - Little dark, hard to get good food pics, very comfy and rustic with large pieces of artwork around the walls.  Service - Amazing, friendly, well orchestrated, each dish was explained to us with great attention and detail, water was always full (yes it matters), napkin set when you arrive back from the rest room... A+  Cost - Not too shabby $$$ (the dual tax in Canada kills it a bit)"}
{"text":"Tellement, tellement bon. J'y suis allée pour ma fête et WOW. Nous avons pris le menu dégustation à huit services. Et ne vous fiez pas à ceux qui disent que les quantités sont petites. J'ai un excellent appétit (trop grand) et je n'avais plus faim à la fin du repas (on parle quand même de huit services sur deux heures...). Oui, chaque plat est plutôt petit, mais il y en a beaucoup. L'agencement des saveurs était incroyable. Ça valait tout à fait le 60 $. Je le recommande à n'importe qui n'est pas difficile (puisqu'il n'y aucun choix). Mais tout est si bien préparé que j'ai même aimé (adoré) des ingrédients qui me laissent habituellement indifférente. Sans parler du service, qui était excellent. Même plus qu'excellent. J'y retournerai, certain."}
{"text":"A fixed menu of delightfully surprising tastes and textures. Go to this restaurant! Taste everything that they put in front of you and marvel at the discovery of a whole new world of flavours. The wine accompaniment menu is worth splashing out for too."}
{"text":"Tasting menus for people who don't normally enjoy tasting menus! Also for people who love tasting menus. Haven't tried a tasting menu before? This is the perfect place to cut your teeth (not literally though... the food is quite tender here).    So here's what we ate, but take it with a grain of salt (or pour liberally, I'm not your boss), because the menu changes almost weekly.   1) Their spin on a Blooming onion: a crispy onion chip peppered with bits a cheese, over a burnt onion. 10/10  2) The most amazing elk tartar I've ever eaten, with crispy fried shallots and mushrooms. 11/10   3) A perfectly executed octopus dish. I forget what else was in it because I get overly excited about octopus and tuned out the description. 12/10   4) The best creamy gnocchi I've ever eaten, topped with a melt in your mouth chorizo and served with the best sourdough bread in Montreal. 15/10   5) Blackened Maine cod with... I dunno something delicious. 13/10   6) A lamb dish that was so rich and tender and delicious that I'm convinced it's the result of meticulous experimentation in a top secret government lab. I would be happy if our tax dollars went to such important research. 14/10  There was also a slew of desserts: a deconstructed apple pie, some pumpkin thing and mulled wine jellies. And of course, caramalized cheese and their famous PBFGJ (peanut butter, foie gras and jam) sandwich.   Cap the whole thing of with incredible service, a perfect atmosphere and a stellar wine list, and you're in for one of the best meals you'll ever eat in Montreal. At least until you go back."}
{"text":"We went for a friend's B-Day and we all had the 9 course tasting menu. It was very good but the only downfall was that the portions were very small. Some of us were joking around that we should go to burger king afterwards and so we ordered the peanut butter jam foie gras sandwich before the dessert to fill us up. I've had it before and both times I had it I found it to be very delicious!! It's very rich though so I recommend sharing the sandwich. The beet salad was good considering I'm not a big fan of beets and it didn't look or tasted the way I expected it too. It looked like pasta with a light creamy filling inside. My favorite dish was the fish. OMG it was the best fish ever! I don't really eat fish but if I knew how to make that dish I totally would eat it regularly. The halibut with the morel mushrooms were so tasty and it melted in your mouth. Mmmm. I would go back for the PBJFG sandwich and and the halibut!!"}
{"text":"Spectacularly disappointing, after all the 4- and 5-star reviews. If a restaurant is going to lead with a tasting menu, it had better be TASTY. Each dish came with an elaborate fanfare of explanation of ingredients, to which the dish did not live up. The waiter seemed untrained and had to go ask if there were an à la carte menu as well as a tasting menu, as advertised on their website. In the end, we all ordered the tasting menu. The amuse-bouche dish was a deep fried asparagus tip. Meh. My guests were asking about plates, there were none, so greasy fingers it was. One said the asparagus would've been better with a dip. The next dish had a beef tartare inside a leaf of the base of a fennel bulb, and I was told they could do  a veggie version for me. It was one of the blandest dishes I've ever paid for, and my carnivore companions reported that the tartare was bland, also--none of the complexities or seasoning of other tartare. The noodle dish was hot and cooked to the right toothsome texture but also singularly bland. One of my companions said, \"All I can taste is starch and fat.\" Even the 2-3 tiny mushrooms lacked their characteristic umami. We were all hoping for more from the halibut. I ate about two bites and left 2/3 on the plate-- more blandness, and a weird chewiness and resistance to being cut with a knife. I thought perhaps they'd cured the fish, like ceviche. The waiter had poured tiny containers of sauce around the fish, but took these away with him. Too bad, the little bit of herbed sauce was the only tasty thing on the plate. The waiter asked about the halibut, and I said I didn't like it, and didn't elaborate. He apparently reported this to the chef, because someone else came out and insisted nicely on cooking something else. We all got a piece of grilled salmon with tiny squash blossoms and a beurre blanc sauce. Finally something tasty, worthy of a tasting menu. We appreciated this kind gesture. Then the cheese. This was not good: three tiny slices of a Quebec cheese akin to Swiss cheese, on a bed of a sweet pistachio butter, topped with something the waiter was unable to describe but looked a bit like a syrupy hibiscus leaf. These flavours did not jive. This dish was teensy weensy and yet we still left food on the plate. And with all the marvellous cheeses in this province! The dessert of shaved pound cake on a coconut cream with chantilly was quite tasty but not presented well. My coffee was not on my bill, so I asked the waiter if it was included, and he said he'd forgotten to add it. He started to wave it off, then said, \"I'll go add it.\" Just. So. Wrong. As we waited I asked my out-of-town guests if they'd come back here if they lived here, and they both mouthed, \"Nooooooo.\" One said, \"I've eaten worse food. This wasn't bad--it just wasn't at all good.\" Hence 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"If you walked into this restaurant on what would certainly be a rare slow night, you'd never imagine the pure magic that occurs if you only considered the decor.  We were lucky to snag two seats during a short visit, and sat down at 9:30 in a packed restaurant (in the States we'd already be closing up for the night).  Our servers were young ladies, very knowledgeable of the menu and ingredients, and enthusiastic.  The menu and presentation is a tasting design, these are not full servings.  But the food is magic!  First course we started with endive and walnut salad, and the famous PBJFG.  If you're a heart patient you should run for the door NOW!  The peanut butter and foie gras melt together and turn into this delicious rich emulsion on toast with just a touch of sweetness.  Next was the sirloin with salsify and truffle.  Then fish with leeks and lemon grass and finally the morel and galic toffee.    Go with an open mind, try anything that strikes your fancy...this is a culinary adventure...really!  For dessert I had the malted ice cream sandwich and my wife had the fig phylo.  If I had any negative comment, I'd like slightly larger portions on some of the dishes!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal at La Fantôme. My wife and I split one tasting menu ($50), adding the second entree ($15) and the foie gras PBJ sandwich ($15). It was the perfect amount of food (I personally find tasting menus to be too much food for me) The amuse bouche was tempura asparagus. I thought it was fine, but perhaps a bit heavy for an amuse bouche. Next was beef tartare wrapped in fennel. The fennel was thick, you had to slice it with a steak knife, and it was a weird pairing - the tartare is too delicate to be served in something thick like that.  Fortunately, every dish after the fennel was excellent. The spaghetti with mushrooms and truffles was amazing - light and rich at the same time. The first entree was salmon over peas. The salmon was perfectly cooked- the consistency of butter - and the sauce was amazing. The second entree - lamb - was amazing. It came with fava beans and a bbq sauce, which sounded a bit odd but was so good I wanted to lick the plate. Dessert was a thinly slice cake over a lemon creme, a lovey was to end.  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, but the portions are small and it is rather pricey for the size. Every dish we had was perfect in terms of taste and presentation. The PB&J+foie gras sandwich really stands out in my memory, as does the fig pastry dessert. As a group of three, we essentially had a few bites of each dish. We shared 6 dishes + 2 desserts and paid about $45 each after taxes and tips (we didn't have any drinks).  As someone with an already small appetite, I left the restaurant 70% full, which is just perfect for me, but I could understand how most people will leave complaining that they could eat another meal afterwards.  If you want  wonderfully creative dishes, only had to split each plate with one or two people and you don't care about the price, then this is a great new restaurant to try out. The service is friendly, the decor is nice. You will have a lovely night.   Just remember, the first seating is at 6 pm and the second is at 8 pm! but then again, with such small dishes, there isn't much worry about not being able to finish in 2 hrs, you just need to figure where to go next to enjoy the rest of the evening!"}
{"text":"Tasting menus can be scary to some people. Will I like all the dishes served to me? Why can't I just order what I want? Or more importantly, do I trust the chef enough to fully guide my restaurant experience? Fundamentally that is the question when confronted with a tasting menu. Personally, I think the tasting menu is a great way to evaluate a restaurant as it should technically be what the chef wishes to serve you. If you don't like the tasting menu then I suspect the restaurant will not be for you. In Montreal, a few recent restaurants have decided to go only tasting menu - a bold choice but one that certainly can be interesting. One of these is Le Fantome.   Hidden on William street, Le Fantome is very unassuming from the outside. The narrow room is sparsely lit decorated only with abstract paintings from chef Jason Morris's great- grandfather. Not my style artistically but it goes create a nice intimate setting. As our table was not ready, manager Kabir Kapoor provided us with a couple of glasses of white wine for our troubles. That level of quality service continued throughout the night. Very attentive and friendly.  Once we were sitting, we were provided a menu with both a small or large tasting menu to choose from. The menu simply listed the primary ingredient of each dish. The rest was explained by our wait staff as we received each dish. I went for the larger tasting menu which was comprised of 7 plates and 2 desserts.  First was a simple amuse bouche of blackberries with foie de volaille. A nice combination of sweet and richness.  Our second course was a beet salad with creme fraiche, almonds, pistachios and graham crackers. This course let us know that we would be in good hands on this night. The beets were fresh and sliced thinly. The richness of the creme fraiche paired so well with the beets. The nuts brought a little crunch and the addition of the graham crackers added a extra hint of sweetness.  Third course was a raisin and blueberry salad with black liquorice. Pretty simple overall. I was surprised at how the black liquorice came through but there wasn't much to get excited about here otherwise.  The fourth dish was a beef tartar with red peppers, olive oil and elephant garlic shavings. Served in strips, the beef was nice and tender. The dish has good kick to it - reminded me as a stir-fry from a flavour profile. I honestly didn't pick up the garlic very much. The sweetness of the red pepper was more noticeable.  The next course was a little more unique - Popcorn risotto. A very creamy risotto with actual popcorn mixed in. A cool textural play and the popcorn brought a nice buttery flavour to the dish. I honestly found the risotto itself lacking any punch without the popcorn flavour-wise though.  The next dish was salmon lightly poached with kombucha spices, crispy skin, basil and lemon puree. My girlfriend didn't enjoy the almost raw texture but I found it interesting. The basil and the puree were the big flavour providers though. The spices didn't do much for me.  The seventh dish was a standout for me: Chicken breast and thigh with salsa verde and chicken jus. Loved the chicken two ways - the deep fried thigh had a great crunch to it. The salsa verde was fresh and flavourful. The chicken jus was rich and smooth. Great showcase of execution and technique.  Now.... Le Fantome offers another dish which you can add to your tasting for a great fee. It is the dish that they are know for early in their existence: a PBJ and foie gras sandwich on toasted brioche. Just amazing - if you don't like foie gras, it won't work for you. For the rest of us though, such a great combination - the buttery brioche, the rich sliver of foie gras, the sweet jam and the smooth peanut butter.   Dessert-wise, we got to try 4 different ones as the shorter tasting (which my girlfriend took) had 2 different desserts than mine. First was a raspberry sorbet sandwich. Loved the strong berry taste and the smooth sorbet texture.  Second was pear with whipped mascarpone. Our favorite dessert of the night. So simple and yet so effective. Whipping the mascarpone lighten the texture and that richness was perfect with the sweet pear.  Third was Corn Creme Caramel. Loved the texture of the creme caramel and how the use of corn subtly changed the flavour. However, the burnt caramel sauce didn't work for either of us. It felt too burnt and left a taste that lacked the sweetness we wanted.  The final dessert was a pair of Jade Orange candies. A bit-sized hit of nice orange flavour. No complaints here.  Le Fantôme's tasting menu spoke of a refined and well-executed cuisine focused on the market that is able to have some fun at the same time. I very much enjoyed the experience of following chef Morris' inspirations and seeing where he and his staff would take us. A excellent date night all-around and that was all that mattered. Thanks to chef Morris and Kabir. Pleasure having you in the neighbourhood.   Cheers!"}

{"text":"funny story we were trying to go to the restaurant next door and accidentally walked into this one and once we were seated i did not want to be a jerk and take off  let me start with the fact that i did not want to eat in griffintown but i was starved and i refuse to get around montreal other than on foot and we were at least a 40 minute walk from home all the places that we walk by in this neighborhood seem a little too trendy for me and i did not feel like dealing with it  so glad i was hungry and gave in  le fantôme features a tasting menu which is something that i had enjoyed elsewhere in the past as it gives you a chance of trying different things without totally overdoing it at the end of the experience you might still feel you ate too much but i not as guilt inducing as if you had eaten 10 full sized meals  they do ask you about allergies and aversions and will customize if needed our last plate was supposed to be pork but it was duck instead and there was no explanation for this but it was very tasty just the same just wondering how the pork would have been as it is my favorite protein  even things that i normally would not order or eat were real good veal which i never eat was great cooked fish which i often avoid was great particularly the char which was like eating a piece of butter so good  service was attentive and on point ambiance very nice good background music  definitely a must try"}
