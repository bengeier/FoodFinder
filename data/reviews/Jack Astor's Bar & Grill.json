{"text":"They compute your tax after they add an automatic 18% service fee. 

The server brought me a wrong dish the first time. The meat in the burger is over-cooked. It tastes really bad."}
{"text":"Had dinner here after attending desi fest in Dundas square on Saturday night. Food was ok, and service was fine. The pull of the place is the great terrace patio overlooking Dundas square. I would go again just to sit there."}
{"text":"I just love this restaurant! What a fun place to eat!
I'm a burger kinda gal, and with the tables lined with fullscap paper and a cup of crayons provided - who wouldn't have fun over a burger and literally writing all over the dinner table!
Food, service, prices, atmosphere are all just great here!
Never a bad meal, service, etc... here."}
{"text":"This place is a hit and miss. Sometimes you get good service sometimes u don't, sometimes you get good food sometimes you won't.  The best items on the menu are the wings and nachos. Forget the martinis, they are all watered down unless you JACK IT UP!"}
{"text":"Large space for group events and great service. Food is decent as well - a good go to if you're in the area and just craving drinks and basic food"}
{"text":"We showed up with a full hockey team and the parents and service was outstanding. Diversified menu to please everyone."}
{"text":"I made reservations here for a birthday party, they were very accommodating to the 12 of us. The food was excellent and prompt as always and the service was fantastic! The waitresses/waiters that served us were super nice and the manager was just amazing. They even gave me a complementary brownie for my birthday. This is great place for a quiet dinner or a big party!"}
{"text":"Went there for a friend's birthday celebration. We had made reservations for the group of ~20 and when I arrived 20 minutes after our 5:50 reservation expected to find my party seated. 

No such luck.  Finally we were instructed to come in and have a seat, about 7:30. When we came in they only had seats for 16 of the 21. So the rest of us went to the bar, after being reassured that a table would free up very quickly. On waiting another 20 min or so we asked the hostess about seating and were instructed to take the next available table. 

After sitting at a table as it freed up we were approached by a server who informed us that there was a wait list and that we couldn't sit at that table. When we explained the situation she seemed quite disbelieving and the manager was called. I explained the situation and was told they were trying to seat us closer to our party. 

I'm not sure why, as at this point everyone else was eating their meal or had already finished. Finally got a table and two servers came over, sans menu, to take our orders. Had to ask them for menus and later in the night we had to request water for the table. 

To top it all off we were smacked with a 15% service charge that we weren't informed of beforehand. I'm not sure if it was because they had to try so very hard to give such awful service, with zero communication between the employees and give us snide looks when we asked about our reservation.

All in all, the food was average, the drinks were decent and the service was abominable. Only bright spark was the bartender, who was friendly and efficient. However, I won't be returning, not to this or any other Jack Astor's location."}
{"text":"What a nice gem in the heart of it all. Great location with lots to do around. Staff here are excellent. Good atmosphere. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food was good had burger. Beer was nice. But it is pricy. Dinner for 2 with drinks costed us 75 & thinking it's a bar to me it is expensive"}
{"text":"Great service, and delicious food! First pub I have been too since moving to Calgary, and I enjoyed it a lot. Good vibes!"}
{"text":"Much better experience tonight that last month. Hostess was cordial. Waitress was sweet. Food was fantastic. The booths are way too skinny width wide though.  Unless you're a size 4."}
{"text":"This corporate monster needs to be shut down. It seems it is getting worse as the years pass, but really, never a good experience, and this will be the last time ever. 
At any location! Honestly. 
Decided to head in after a long foodless day because the kitchen was open till 1am. Didn't know that that meant the kitchen was going to suck for that last hour. Might as well have stopped for some pizza. Forgotten appetizer and warm wine with an invisible server while the bar was barely full with probably 50% of the people there like us just trying to find something open on a Tuesday night and the other 50% being staff. The server finally came around with our mains after a good 30 minutes then claimed the kitchen burnt our app and that it was going to be rushed out to us. Fine we said. Plates were cold and barely desirable but we ate as she disappeared again, never checking in on us. Thankfully my hungry man finished my dish as it couldn't be bothered a very sad first meal in 30 plus hours. He managed to finish both mine and his meal long before the bruschetta (our appetizer) arrived. How in the world that took 50 minutes to put out is beyond me. The server dropped our bill off after asking if we wanted any drinks for last call. That was the most I had seen of her. That and her lingering around with the damn debit machine when u said we'd be paying cash. Eager for my tip but completely undeserving. I paid when he went to the john, then waited down stairs and as my boyfriend comes outside he says she had the bill fold in her and and muttered something, I won't bother sharing that but really, I tipped accordingly and Rita you should have expected it. 
Corporate restaurants like this one are a just a drain and disappointment.  
Hey if you're kitchen is open late make sure they can plate $9 bread in under an hour...Jack Asses!"}
{"text":"Why aren't there more place like this one! In Toronto, you apparently can find better japanese food than in Japan, better middle eastern food than in Lebanon, even better french food than in Paris (si, si), but it is almost impossible to find at least average North American food. Apparently, good burgers can only be found in two kind of places: either in a greasy basement operated by a gorilla or in a big empty hallway looking like the deck of the starship Enterprise.  Well Jack Astors is the exception. It's big but warm, it's clean but friendly. The people who work here are so nice that it is almost unreal and the burgers are really good. And they have wines that don't make you wish you were a beer drinker, which is very rare in this area of town. One more thing, do not miss the smallest brownie in the world. Delicious and only 98 cents!"}
{"text":"DIARRHEA !! Just bad.. server didn't check up on us, our glass was empty for 25 mins... our food took forever! I had to go up and talk to the manager.. I go to the washroom and there's no soap.. in any of them. Fml. Then my order came with sauce that I couldn't eat.. I specially told her and she repeated it back to me.. yet it came out wrong. Oh and to top it off, the food gave me diarrhea the next day. And the food wasn't even good.. pfft"}
{"text":"Jack Astors is a fun place to go for a few drinks with friends. I highly recommend sitting at the bar on a Friday or Saturday night as they put on some great shows!! As for the food & service, they are either great or it's a complete disaster. So it's definitely a hit or miss on that end."}
{"text":"I know I know... what am I doing in Mississauga?! Well my girlfriend lives in one of those glitzy new condo buildings that surround the colossal Square One shopping centre. And I discovered that Mississauga really is stuck in this interesting melange of suburban-urban with skyscrapers and condo buildings paired with restaurants such as Jack Astor's and a Wal-Mart. Bizarre to say the least, but yet an interesting progression in urban planning. Hurricane Hazel has constructed an interesting kingdom for her minions. 

Anyways--to my actual review of this restaurant. I mean, it's a chain right?! Like it really shouldn't even be reviewed on a site like Yelp, right?! Well truthfully I really had a f-ing fabulous time last night at this outpost of the popular chain! I had a Steamwhistle beer (which they had on tap!!! amazing!!!). There are over 20 beers on tap! no more musty beer from a can for me! The cocktails were fabulous too like wowwowow loved them. So delicious, if not a little watered down. The 'jacked size,' or whatever clever term they assign to upsizing the quantity of alcohol, is worth it IMHO. 

The food was great too--I highly recommend the 'sauced never frozen chicken fingers,' the battering is not too heavy, and the chicken is like melt in your mouth good. Now I know I'm talking about this place like a 5-star restaurant in Vieux-Montreal but actually you have to take this place for what it is and appreciate the drinks, and food for what they are. And they're great!

Our waitress Lisa was sosososo fun! she put up with our drunk asses after downing a few of those Jack-sized cocktails. She was prompt, and sweet, and attentive. Unlike that skanky cesspool of a place, Earls, over at the mall where the waitresses are fierce (and not in the gay good way). Lisa even emptied the ashtray a few times while we were smoking, not letting more than a few butts pile up. Class act! Earls told us to leave when one of us lit up near the patio! 

Anyways: Mississauga you're not so bad. Jack Astor's you're so suburban chic!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Jack Astor's so I'm fairly pleased with the service. I had dropped in just to grab a bite before a movie and ordered the usual chicken quesadilla and beer. However I was feeling a bit adventurous today and went for the pulled pork poutine and the bruschetta (sharing with my boyfriend I don't eat that much alone!) 

Anyways aside from the quesadilla the pulled pork poutine was extremely delicious. The fries were built like a tower of cheesy goodness that had a hidden fountain of gravy in the middle. It was really worth trying something new.

Secondly we had started with the bruschetta. Automatically it had thrown us off. We were expecting a garlic salty taste however the vinegar was nothing but sweet. We immediately put it down and notified the waitress. She admitted it wasn't her favourite dish and quickly replaced it with something else free of charge.  

Anyways if you're ever at Jacks I'd recommend anything but the bruschetta. Other then that service and atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner on the patio overlooking the corner spot at dundas and victoria 

Luckily I went early before the rush and didn't have to wait for a table. Although I was wondering why there was a useless hostess outside the main hostess station when they werent busy haha! 

Sorry but the girls just look okay. I get the itty bitty outfits but it's not cool to see rolls. :/

I like the humour at at jacks. The quotes on the shirts are funny and wity. Same thing for their beer mugs!

I ordered the strawberry iceberg beer with coor light and it was great. They actually brought me the wrong drink at first but took back their twister. 

The nachos are my favourite at jacks. It's extra cheesy because they add cheese spread. The portion is beast size for $15! A better deal if you have SPC.

Overall, this place is just okay to chill. The patio glass is dirty, you chill with pigeons, and service takes a while. 

Ps. My waitress tries to hustle with random compliments haha pretty clever but kinda sleezy. Guess you gotta encourage tips in any way! You'll know if you get her haha

Hope this helps,
-jT"}
{"text":"Their nachos are my favourite and possibly one of the best in town! I've even requested BBQ sauce in the side as an extra dip. The price for the huge plate is a great value :):) 

But this is probably the only thing I like there, with an iceberg beer.

The poutines were awful (I had it a year ago and never ordered it again) 

Hope this helps!

{"text":"I just went here for lunch with five other people and ten minutes after being seated the hostess came back to ask us who our server was - how would we know? Nobody had come by!

So she took our drink and food orders - 20 minutes later food and drinks arrived together. Once we were eating the server came over to introduce himself - his name was Jonathan (not sure why he'd bother introducing himself at that point) and we asked for our bill. Jonathan came back with the bill, threw it down on the table and said he had real tables to go deal with. I guess we were fake? 

If you go to this location make sure you aren't seated in his section!"}
{"text":"Service was alright however I've found multiple hairs in my food and all the company offered was a new dish, however I was quite put off by the hair and had lost my appetite. Ever since the new management has taken over this place has gone down hill! Avoid this place at all costs! The Mexican place behind it is great though! Also kind of bothers me how so. We other people get there food before me when I came in before them and had been waiting for something as simple as chicken fingers for 20 minutes. I will not be returning to this disgusting establishment."}
{"text":"Hopped in for a late lunch/early dinner on father's day afetr my son's time with his dad. Was delighted to have a great server Chantelle. Very professional, polite and attentive hostess i.must say. Well versed with kid's deviating choices and know to share young one's excitement  for their dessert treats.. Im definitely coming back also for some more soccer :)"}
{"text":"The service was ok, but the food was not what I was expecting, I always get the same thing every time I go to any jackasstors. I thought I would try this one since It was on the way but the bow tie pasta which I always get was not enjoyable what so ever. It just did not taste the way I usually always get it . As well the atmosphere was not something I enjoyed, I will definitely be taking my business elsewhere maybe to shops at don mills or downtown."}
{"text":"The staff that work here are very friendly, great service. The food was delicious I would recommend the bruchetta for an appitiser it is delicious, and chicken fajitas for an entrée."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time, it was a really good spot before. The menu has completely changed they don't even have their famous big nachos just a stupid long board with nachos on it, I can finish it on my own. A lot of the items they have removed and it is only a one page menu. Along with the poor choices on the menu, the management is terrible. There was two instances where I called to reserve tables at the bar and they told me no reservations at the bar. I'm like okay I understand that makes sense it's playoff baseball time. I arrived about an hour before the Jays game on two different occasion to take a table at the bar, I was told I can't I need a reservation they are reserved for the 'regulars'. The manager shoved me into a corner table with no proper view of the screens and told me to sit there when almost 80% of the bar was empty. From that point on I decided I will never step foot into that Jack Astors location again."}
{"text":"Came here a few times with my friends both dinner and late-night dinner. It was always crowded so if you can make reservations just in case. The variety of food was not that great in my opinion. They had repetitive food choices. The service was okay they took a while to get back to us since the waiter/waitress were serving other people as well. I see some families bring their kids here but I would not really suggest it since people drink here and are very loud. Overall it's not the worst but not the best."}
{"text":"I ordered a mixed greens salad with grilled chicken. I must admit that this is not a salad place and I went because my son wanted a burger... 
My salad scored 2/10 as there was not much mix as it was mainly romaine lettuce, small rotten cherry tomatoes and fancy beets. It contains approx 1/5 of a chicken breast which tasted good and contributed to the 2 point score. Serving rotten tomatoes is not a reassuring practice and leaves doubt about what you cannot see. My son gave a score of 4/10 to its burger but he liked the fries."}
{"text":"Nice food & friendly service. A bit slow on checking in, but not slow enough to complain. Try the cheesy-bread. My gf love it."}
{"text":"It was packed on a Saturday evening when I went with a group of 4, but luckily I called around noon to put my name on the \"waiting list\". This waiting list doesn't gurantee you a reservation but let's you somewhat jump the line. The place was packed, too packed. I also felt the washrooms (men's) was far too small to accommodate the crowd the location brings in (note: other Jack's have much bigger washrooms). The service was bogged down but pleasant. I ordered the chicken wings, but wasn't impressed with how greasy/watery the sauce was. 

If your planning on watching a sporting event, know that they don't put on the game's audio, rather they pump loud Top 40 stuff.

Not sure I'd go back, lots of other places around the area. However the patio overlooking \"Toronto's Times Square\" looked peat neat."}
{"text":"Always good food and service here.  The garlic cheese pan bread is delicious.  My family and I order it every time.

The last 2 times I have eaten here I have ordered the Montreal Smoked Meat poutine.  It's right below the appetizers on the menu.  It eats like a meal.  I'm 6\"3, 220 and I'm full when I'm finished it.  The thing I love most is the crunchy dill pickles they dice and add to the top.  It adds another level of flavour to this already yummy dish.  

My wife always, and I mean ALWAYS, ordered the crab/lobster dip.  I'm not a dip fan but it looks good and she raves about it every time.  It's served with fresh made tortilla chips and pita bread.

One more thing I like about Jack Astors, I can order a cherry Coke.  Not too many other places in Calgary offer Coke with a shot of cherry flavouring (probably Grenadine)."}
{"text":"I have been here to this location many times and never had an issue with any of the food on the menu. The service can be a little slow but the staff is quite friendly. Food is better than average for a chain restaurant. You do not leave feeling like a grease ball nor is the food bland. I will continue coming back here"}
{"text":"I went here while on vacation in toronto with my family. The food was excellent and the atmosphere was attractive to myself and not off-putting to my parents and still appropriate for my 11-year-old sister. Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly... but when you get down to it the thing that will make or break this restaurant is the atmosphere. I enjoyed my dinner here thoroughly and would gladly come back."}
{"text":"Jack Astor's is usually a safe bet but this time was a complete disappointment. Calamari was literally just a handful. Sandwhich was tiny. Pasta was bleh. I also had a ceasar cocktail, which was on the stronger side (which was ok) but barely any clamato or kick. All that for over $60. So NOT worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Was there on a business lunch and was too busy talking to notice that our lunch was slow to arrive. When it did, the manager came over to apologize and took care of the bill-- on his own volition! Clearly, these people take customer service and delivery seriously. Will gladly go there again."}
{"text":"First Yelp check-in here, but have been here at least twice before. I like the concept - large open space with the long bar and large panel of individual tv screens. The decor is varied and interestimg which creates an atmosphere conducive to noisy chatter - this a good thing! The friendly hostess greeted us and lead us to a small booth. I hadn't noticed on previous visits, but children are allowed so there were a number of families adding to the busy Saturday lunch.

Our server was quick to set us up with drinks and she quickly pointed out specials. Quick deliberation and we took her recommendation of bruschetta. This appie arrived quickly and was good. We ordered.our meals - I had a chicken sandwich and caesar salad and my co-dining Babe had something similar (damn, if I can remember the menu names). Regardless, the food arrived after a short wait. Both meals were fresh and hot. Mine was pretty good if not overwhelming in size. Salad was good. Co-diner's opinion was same as mine decent, but not something to rave about.

I like this spot, but it is not a place I would normally frequent.

I concur with a few of the other reviewers in that flies seem to be an issue. We were pestered by a couple of flies. I can appreciate that they like to dine out too, but they should be relegated to the dumpster out back!"}
{"text":"Ate at this particular Jack Astors on April 15th. I had their Sauced up Chicken fingers tossed in hot Buffalo wing sauce. I've always been a fan of Jack Astor's chicken fingers and I wasn't disappointed. Evenly breaded, perfectly fried and a moist center and the wing sauce gave it a nice kick without being overpowering.  They definitely deserve four stars for their food, they get the extra star for service.

We were celebrating a birthday on April 15th in the Yorkville area and we weren't there long before the bar we were at got hit with the blackout that plunged the west end in darkness. We were still hungry and thirsty so we went out wandering and without meaning to found Jack Astors. 

The place was pretty busy for a Tuesday night but they were able to get 25+ people seated with drinks in front of them in under 30mins. This place salvaged what could have been a terrible night."}
{"text":"Good spot. Nice ambience. Decent service.
But....
The patio chairs are bad and I wished they had better food :( Too expensive for average food!"}
{"text":"I like this location. It is well planned out with the dining on one side and the bar on the other, but still an open concept design. The patio is huge and has a great atmosphere. I like coming here for late night food as they have great appetizers (the lobster and crab dip is my top choice!) Sometimes the service is slower but it does get quite busy in there. I recommend this location over other Jack Astor spots."}
{"text":"Most definitely one of the coolest places to have real food, real service and a great fun environment. Good for the boys and good to take the wife/gf out for an upbeat and fun time. You're lucky if you gave Oshie or Adrianna as your servers.  I come here at least 1-2 per month!"}
{"text":"I went there for dinner at the bar on a Friday night. Very lively crowd, the food (I had a jerk pork) was a little bit underwhelming although the flavors were there, and the TV screen wall demanded your attention... but the stars of the night had to be the bartenders. Andie(?) would introduce herself to you and get your name, the other two were flinging beers through the air with abandon. Quite a memorable experience and I would go back again."}
{"text":"The service was awful. The restaurant wasn't that busy our waitress took forever to bring our drinks and forever to bring the bill."}
{"text":"This place exists for tasteless douchbags who have no idea where to go. The waiters had no clue why Hendricks needed cucumber instead of lime, and the food probably came straight out of a freezer to re-heat and eat. Stay home. The view isnt even worth all that. If someone asks you on a date here, don't even bother showing up and definitely tell them theyre not for you. Trust me there."}
{"text":"I give points to their wait staff, who are very friendly and listen if you have special needs or specific requests on how you would like your food prepared. Sometimes the food doesn't come out as hot as it should, but they are always willing and able to fix that. 
Good price, pretty big servings and they go the extra mile to ensure that you are satisfied, because they want you to come back. Which we do. My friends and I frequent this place. Standard fare in terms of selection so you can always find something good to eat. I love their garlic pan bread - great comfort food."}
{"text":"December 28 4:30pm: The hostesses have absolutely no idea what they're doing. They blindly take you through the restaurant trying to find empty tables rather than having any semblance of organization. They gave our table away to a group that arrived after us. In an attempt to fix their mistake, they asked us to wait for 5 minutes for a new table. After 15 minutes of not being approached, we approached the hostesses again and they rudely told us we wouldn't have our table for another 20 minutes. Rude and disgraceful service, avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, and great service!  Not a huge fan of the little (teeny tiny!) black dresses worn by the servers, but we were treated well and had a great meal.  The turkey burger was a new menu item, and really well-cooked.  Not dry, not smooshy.  I also had the \"world's most ridiculously small brownie\" which was not so small, actually.  It's a good 4-5 bites (maybe 2 inches square) with a dollop of whipped cream and carmel sauce too...for like 96 cents!"}
{"text":"Yet another ho-hum restaurant.  Why do Canadian chain restaurants suck so badly?

Came here with my work colleagues about a month ago.  It was so effin cold, I should have had a soup and sandwich.. but in an attempt to watch the waist line, I had the \"California\" Grilled Chicken Salad.  

The greens definitely looked like something out of a plastic bag and definitely looked depressed.  I think it was served 2 days ago, it would have faired better.  I only saw one piece of tomato in there (and I love tomatoes!).  The grilled chicken was as tough as leather.

As for the service, we put in several requests for soda re-fills before actually receiving one (after the meal was finished)...... I somehow don't see myself repeating the visit."}
{"text":"Waiter rushed us because we were only having drinks. Hadn't even finished my first drink and we were given the bill. The place was half empty. Left a bad taste in my mouth. Unfortunately I don't think I'll be returning in the near future. Had negative experiences in the past with this place but I think it's time to move on. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Service souks the stake was good nice big screen tv if you need to go end see any games price was right"}
{"text":"I think it's fair to start by saying I LOVE Jack Astors, the quirky ambiance, the silly slogans on their shirts, the AFV playing on half the TVs so I'm not obligated to watch sports, I Love it all! Probably my FAVOURITE Bruschetta on the planet so I may be bias but this location is THE BEST. Everyone is so nice and friendly and the service is always fast and efficient. If there's ever been a problem with my food it's been corrected quickly (which almost NEVER happens and I've been there a lot). The foods I have tried that I LOVE are, Bruschetta, Pan Bread, Calamari, Wings, Fajitas, spring rolls, nachos and some different sandwiches which have all been great. I would highly recommend this location to anyone and I drive from Kitchener to get to it, so there!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  The wait staff are cool and friendly, Mike was our main server.  The food was delicious....I could have eaten a tub of the Crab & Lobster Dip (stuff dreams are made of).  I had the Pad Thai with shrimp, my daughter had the Brie Burger - no complaints.  The Astor Blastor drink (non-alcoholic) was divine.  I consider myself a foodie of sorts and my taste buds were singing from all of the flavours.  This is a fun place with great eats.  It is family friendly and can get very loud.  I will definitely visit again when I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"Sat for 15 minutes on the patio and no one came by. Went across to milestones"}
{"text":"I actually quite like Jack Astor's as a chain - they keep their menu changing and there is plenty to choose from. I do appreciate their overall humor in atmosphere and branding. 

This location in particular has a bustling patio area in the summer, and is often a pretty good spot pop into if meeting friends for a drink and/or a quick bite/appetizer pre-Jays game or downtown event. 

Service is okay and the internal layout of the restaurant is a bit dark. This wouldn't be my first choice in the neighborhood, but think that if you are looking for a sports bar type environment that is mid-range priced with decent food - this may be a fit. 

The salads, chicken fingers and burgers aren't too bad and the portions are often generous.  Not really a first choice, but delivers when/if needed."}
{"text":"My first experience at this location was ok. I arrived with 2 other people and we were seated right away despite it was a Saturday night. we sat at a nice booth close to the entrance but did not get a draft. Me and my companions look young for our age especially myself. so I was surprised when our waitress didn't card us when we ordered our pitcher. However when my 3rd companion arrived, they ordered a drink from a waiter walking by who was not working our section but he asked for her I.D. Inconsistent maybe? We also bothered another waiter walking by asked him for water and extra glass and he served it with tact and ease. We ordered the veggie nachos and sweet potato fries. The nachos had a good amount of topping and tortillas and variety of dips filled to the top. The food, atmosphere and decor are decent but service not so much. When I was trying to finish the last of the tortilla and dip the waitress rushed me. Luckily I was being treated by one companion but I would take it personally if I was buying. After two of the companions paid debit the waitress took the machines and walked off. She didn't even try to be attentive to the fact that my companions were going to tip her in cash. She didn't say thanks or a goodbye. My companions felt offended and ended up not tipping her at all. So this waitress walked off mad because she wasn't tipped in debit. Oh well someday someone else won't let her get away with attitude. My hats go off to the boh/heart of house."}
{"text":"I was seated in a noisy part of the restaurant. In between a crying baby and a couple who kept coughing (not hygienic). Though, most of the noise came from the unruly staff. There was also a fly in the restaurant (not hygienic, either). I ordered a burger, and the bun-to-burger ratio was a little off. The meat was bland, too."}
{"text":"First off - I want to say I love Jack Astors food.  And the food is almost always consistent.  Sadly, I have no interest in returning to Jack Astors because of today's experience.  And JA has been our go to place for family birthdays and celebrations.  Our nameless waitress lost out on what would have been a huge tip for her - as she provided some of the worst service I've ever experienced. 

Started off waiting a 1/2 hour before anyone came to our party of 8 to start off on drinks.  Then when the drinks finally arrived, a few of them were wrong.  Waited another 20 minutes to have our order taken.  When food arrived - clearly she'd forgotten who ordered what - and that's fine but don't just randomly drop plates in front of your patrons.  ASK who ordered what.  Show like you give a damn.  Specific condiments were ordered - never arrived - had to ask again for them (10-15 minutes into the meal).  Our waitress was NO WHERE to be found.  Never came back for drink refills or to ask how the meal was.  

Desserts ordered - some of ours never showed up.  It's like half the table didn't even order them.  

The only time she was at our table was bill time - likely checking to see what she was getting as a tip.  Big fat disappointment there wasn't it?  Sorry - I'm not into rewarding people for bad service."}
{"text":"I went to Jackastors this past Saturday July 22nd right after attending the import fest at metro convention centre. We entered the restaurant and asked to sit on the restaurant side the host promptly replied 'only kids sit over there' I thought that was very rude right off the bat. I was was a group of 4 of us and it was a split decision and we then decided to sit at the bar - the music was blaring as they had a rock concert at the acc that same night. The service I receive at Jackastors was terrible 2 of us ordered the chicken bow tie pasta and 2 ordered the sauced up chicken fingers. 1 of the chicken fingers were ice cold and we sent it back it returned 15 minutes later. Then then both chicken bow tie pastas were dry with barely any sauce - now looking back I wish I had taken a photo of whAt happened next - we told the waitress ( who I wish I had taken her name) and she automatically said she would bring pasta sauce for us. Before she takes both entrees back to recook the pasta with the he appropriate amount of sauce she then came back 10 minutes later with The pasta sauce in a little bowl for us to add to our meals. The pasta was still awful as the pasta was now cold and the sauce hot. At the beginning of our meal we placed an order for an additional chicken bow tie pasta to go. When we were ready to pay the waitress said that the pasta is cold and she is having the cooks reheat it, we placed the order to be fresh to go not to be cooked with our dine in meals. The waitress was not accommodating and did not check up on us. I will never return to this location and this was terrible service I wish I took the waitresses name but she was serving us at the bar area on Saturday around 12:30am. Sorry but do not recommend this location"}
{"text":"Seated immediately then ignored for 20min.  Ordered a beer took 15 min to arrive also ordered my medium rare steak at same time.  Steak came when I was 1/2 way through my pint.  It was medium well but I didn't want to wait for a properly cooked replacement so ate and left minimal tip.  Very disappointed in service at this location.   The mashed potatoes were good though."}
{"text":"Jack Astor's is a decent place to catch the NBA playoffs with your typical bar offerings and a couple large multi-screen TVs. There are a number of booths, several tables, and bar seating, however, these are on a first-come, first-served basis. It was pretty packed on Tuesday night for Raptors' Game 1 against the Cavaliers...so it's best to arrive a bit early.

We enjoyed some food with our drinks as well. I ordered the Brie Burger with cheddar beer soup as my side. The soup was quite salty, and on top of that, it was served with salted top crackers. The burger was average -- I liked the thick slice of cheese, but there was only a small amount of cremini mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes, which was disappointing. 

Next time I watch a sports game at Jack Astor's, I may just stick with their drinks and try some of their appetizers."}
{"text":"The menu has lots of choices and the food is good. The service is inconsistent. One thing that is not inconsistent, and really annoys me, is when the server picks up the folder with the money and asks, \"Do you need any change?\" or something along those lines. I talked to the manager about it and was told that the staff had been trained to not do that. I have asked other people who eat there and they all agree that they are always asked that question. 
The one thing that stops me from giving this restaurant a higher review is the prices. The restaurant should be called Jack Astronomical. Other restaurants in the area serve many of the same dishes, like steak frites or eggs benedict, and the difference in price is ridiculous."}
{"text":"The food is always good and the prices are nice and reasonable. The staff is always so friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We came to Jack Astor's Dundas Square on Sun Jun 17th. We started out as a group of 7 & had 3 others joining us later. We asked for a pation seat and waited patiently for about an hour. During this time someone vomitted in front of our table in front of the enterance to the patio. The vomit remained there for at least 1/2 hour before it was cleaned up. In this time patrons, including children had to walk through it. Nothing was put down to cover it up nor was a sign put up to avoid it. We eventually got a table on the patio and ordered more drinks. There was an event at Dundas Square so occasionally we would stand up to look at the crowd. Everyone on the patio was standing up but the security kept targetting and harrassing our table in particular. When asked to sit down we would but also asked why only our table was being asked to sit as others stood, hanging over the balcony taking pics, etc. We were told mind our business. After 2 of our friends left to go downstairs for a bit we were told that they were going to take our table. We informed them that we have other people coming to join us shorty. The manager, John, said he didn't care and if our guests weren't there in 10 minutes he's taking our table. At this point our guests arrived. After we asked to get another chair for our guests we were told there weren't any (which there were) and our friends had to leave because they were standing. Again, there were MANY tables with patrons standing around them but only our table was being harrassed. At this point we decided we will get our bill, finish our drinks and leave. As soon as our bill was paid the security guard - a giant black man with a bald head, about 6'5, 350lbs - came over & informed us we had to leave now. When we asked why they told us that we paid our bill 1/2 hour ago & now we had to leave even though we only just received our bill. We told them this and they said too bad. At this point I told him that I just paid for my drink and I will finish it and leave. The security then grabbed me roughly by the arm and contiuned to push and shove me with all of his might out of the restaurant. I am a female, about 5'8 130lbs. This man used all of his might to push and shove me out even though I told him I would go willingly several times and to please take his hands off of me. I also told him that he's hurting me but he just applied more pressure. It was definitely intentional. At the enterance he literally picked me up and threw me out, to the point that I came off of the ground. Again, I'm half his size yet he handled me like a man. At this point I fell and almost smashed my face in the ground. I now have brusies on my arm and a black eye from the incident. Never in my life have I ever been kicked out of anywhere, let alone abused by staff at a restaurant. I have pictures of my injuries as well as witnesses to the whole thing. There is no need for ANY MAN, especially at a restaurant, to assult a woman in that manner. It's unbelievable & and outrage that we were treated in such a way. This was my first time to Jack Astor's as well as the guests that we had visiting from BC, here to celebrate my birthday. And this is how their last day and my birthday celebration was spent - taking abuse from the Jack Astor's staff. This type of treatment is unacceptable and totally uncalled for. To make matters worse, the manager there, John, just stood and laughed as I was being manhandled by his staff. Completely unprofessional. Needless to say I will never go back to any Jack Astor's again."}
{"text":"I went there, about a week ago. I haven't had a good nights sleep since that night. A specific waiter, named Myles, I don't give half a shit if I spelt that wrong, insulted me to my face while I was ordering, and throughout the duration of the meal. My experience was so bad, a 10 cent tip could not express my disappointment. No wait. I meant dissatisfaction, since I had no high hopes for this shit hole.

If I could I would give them negative 5967 black ass stars. But I can't. So hot chocolate mocha frappacino fudge these bitches."}
{"text":"There are very few places I'd consider going to as a staple to take out-of-towners in Toronto. Jack's has a pretty decent menu for folks to choose from, at the price point and locations throughout the GTA, which is why I'd consider it a place that could satisfy just about anyone.

That said, food is only a part of the restaurant experience. The other part (and more important), is the service. And, the service at this location is very shameful - particularly when there are events going on. I'd say service at downtown restaurants are a big deal, because many tourists travel up and down Front street, and whether or not the waiters/waitresses like to believe this or not, they may be the first point of contact for foreigners. What can I say from my own experience? Waiting for a patio table outside is met with rudeness from waitresses that either don't have enough people skills, or just could care less. Inside isn't much better. I've gone to this location approximately 5 times, and each time I have never had good service. Waitresses forget about your table, cater to larger parties, or simply are just completely rude. 

One day, after waiting 30 minutes for a waitress to return, I complained and the new waitress that served us was very friendly and helpful. When major concerts are going on, I understand a restaurant can get overwhelmed - but this wasn't the case. The restaurant was nowhere near capacity. I was really upset especially after seeing other tables being completely served, while we were waiting for our water. 

If service is a big deal to you as it is to me, I'd think twice about this place. There are a lot of prose of the Jack Astor's brand, but management really needs to give their servers new training on communication and people skills."}
{"text":"I'm not a sports bar person so I didn't really like the atmosphere. But if you go to Jack Astor's you know what you get.

There was only one waiter for at least 15 tables - so everything took pretty long. We ordered some shakes, and those were actually pretty good (and it's been a lot).

The veal skewers where not so good (except for the bread and hummus), but the veggie burger was fantastic. The sweet potato fries were good as well.

It's been a little pricey and like I said everything took pretty long. Don't know if I would go there again..."}
{"text":"went here for my birthday. Was okay made reservations the day off so I know there was going to be a wait. did not expect it to be 1 hour. Got seated in the bar area. Very little lighting. Had appetizers which were good. Had fun but it was just okay."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place.
As has been previously noted, it's a chain, very American, catering to the tourist trade. There are three mini-skirted young women at the front, one of whom was fascinated by her hair. Not much else, apparently. I cannot fathom why there needed to be three of them there at five o'clock on a Wednesday.  Food came quickly and was very tasty. Reasonable value for money. 
Do people really want to see the waitresses' thighs?"}
{"text":"Bonne ambiance et service rapide...un peu moins si on dîne le week-end à 15h !
On aime bien les menus différents et qui changent souvent. Les proportions sont correctes sans êtres exessives, bon dosage."}
{"text":"The food is awful and over priced, as are the drinks

worst part is the Patio! Its so loud in the evenings that you cannot even have a conversation without screaming across the table.

Not recommended!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the food and an extra star for the music and atmosphere!

Multiple times I've been at this location, a great casual spot for drinks and appetizers or even dinner. The drink menu is quite good, various choices of domestic, imported and craft beers, most cocktails are very tasty as well. The nachos at any Jack Astor's locations are usually my go-to. You'd want to share these though because they come in a huge platter. Unless you're really keen on eating it all by yourself...

For dinner entree, I usually get the Asiago Chicken Bowties. Probably the best dish on the menu besides the nachos. The chicken is nicely crusted and tender, on top of the bed of bowtie pasta with a nicely flavoured cream sauce. 

I just went yesterday and wanted to try something else so I got the Shrimply Delicious Pasta. The pasta at first was very bland and the shrimp very salty, together in a VERY light tomato sauce. As I ate this dish though, not sure if my taste buds were already marinated from the salty shrimp but some flavour started to kick in and it wasn't too bad. The texture of the shrimp was cooked perfectly. 

Patio is open and is usually busy especially during summer hours. You get a GREAT view of Yonge & Dundas square, the CN Tower and the wonderful Toronto life. But if you're lucky like I was yesterday (Wednesday night), we (two people) got seated on the patio right away. 

Jacks always has a great selection of music including hip-hop, pop, top 40, edm and some old school hip-hop too. 

Service could be better as sometimes we have to wait a long time for a server to come by or for drinks to arrive. But if you're looking for a good time with friends in a casual setting, you can't really go wrong with Jack Astor's at Yonge and Dundas!"}
{"text":"K so I've frequented Jack Astor's pretty often, but it was my first time visiting this location. Usually Jack's has reliable food and service and a good, fun vibe.

My friends and I were seated in the dining area and I was excited that it was \"Thirsty Thursday\" aka $5 draft beer and wine night. Our server, however, was absolutely terrible, surly, and completely disinterested. I think he was having a bad night. That was what my friends and I were debating throughout the night, as his every interaction was uncomfortable for us. We ordered a burger, chicken salad, chicken goat cheese sandwich, guacamole, pint of beer, dessert, etc. 

Also, really rushed. He gave us really short intervals to order our entrees and desserts, almost pressuring us with his curt expediency. After ordering dessert and before it arrived, the bills were brought out. One minute after I had received my dessert, the card machines were brought around. I was SO tempted to low ball his tip, but, you know, his chip-off-the-shoulder attitude wasn't contagious/didn't affect the food runners who deserved a tip. 

This is a little frustrating as I just moved in the area, and am still scouting out joints to hit up after work... I'm thinking the next time I'm down for casual food like drinks, burgers, etc. I'll head to Beer Bistro or C'est What. When I go to Jack's, I'm not expecting over-the-top, stellar food, so I can do without the surliness."}
{"text":"Omg where to start? They were fantastic! We decided to take the kids for dinner and we had amazing service our food was quick and delicious! The kids enjoyed the colouring table and the free desert! Well moms loved our radiator marinated garlic chicken! We had three servers bring us our food along with fresh pepper and parmesan cheese! Totally pampered meal service! Was very pleasant we make it a ritual now when we take the kids out :)"}
{"text":"The hostesses are absolutely horrible, but the waiters/waitresses are good as is the food. My first time going to Jack Astor's, the hostess gave me an electronic coaster and did not give me the slightest clue how long it would take to get a table for 3. I waited about 45 minutes before I got impatient and went to ask how many tables were ahead of me... I found out that the hostess had FORGOTTEN to put my name on the list along with the coaster she gave me. Needless to say, I was annoyed. None of the three hostesses provided an apology or said anything about their mistake. However, I got lucky and had an amazing waiter that made everything better - he was happy, enthusiastic, polite, and provided good service. He really saved the day.

The second time I went there, the hostesses were again, hopeless. It must be poor management because they always appear to be confused about whats going on. 

Oh, and don't even try to call and make a reservation. They put you on hold and I've waited for over 3 minutes each time without someone picking up.

Moral of the story: If you can get past the ordeal of getting a table, the food and service will be good... but getting a table is the biggest challenge."}
{"text":"Saw a cockroach on the bathroom counter. If this is the state of the bathroom, I'm terrified about the kitchen. Strangely the dining room was closed for \"maintenance\" the evening we dined. We were seated in the pub area. Server was great though."}
{"text":"Way to geared towards families. Try and go for a nice dinner with your date and they sit you beside a table of 10 screaming kids. The food is okay. Typical franchise type food. Nothing local. Nothing fresh. Terrible place to watch hockey. They don't play the game with sound considering how big and amazing the bar is, I find that pretty stupid. The waiters are usually great. The hostesses are terrible. Zero customer service from them. Its more about a fashion show and talking with their friends than caring about people coming in. I rather go to Boston pizza than jacks."}
{"text":"The food here is good for the price. Burgers are a good size. Today I had the Jalapino burger with sweet potato fries and a killkenney. Nice combo. It took forever to serve us cuz they were busy and they forgot about us.  They felt real bad, so they bought the first round for us. Wife had Pad Thai. She liked it. Lots of peanuts. Kid is always happy with a table to write on. Not five stars at it has a franchise feel to it. No character. Trying hard to be unique, but you can't fake that. Reminds me of Hard Rock Cafes, Chilli's, Tony Roma's sort of a thing.

Go and try it, maybe it's your thing."}
{"text":"I wasn't too happy.Showed mngr My burger was raw. she said it was just a little pink and that's the ways she eats it too. They took away the burger b4 I could show the mngr.she said next time I should let the waiter know that I don't want the burger pink"}
{"text":"Sat in the bar side. I ordered the one thing I always order when I go. That's the sauced up chicken fingers because it's delicious. Beer on tap was a bit flat (end of keg!?) so after two I had to switch bottle. New decor looks great! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for the first time in years (I now live in the US) the food was just how I remembered it and the staff was great!"}
{"text":"I've been to Jack Astor's on a couple of occasions. The food is a fairly typical menu of burgers, pastas, pizza, etc., but does include a few interesting dishes such as beer cheese soup (which is pretty tasty, btw). Most recently I had the chicken strips with a caesar salad, and it was clear that the strips were freshly made. I like that they provide Tabasco. I just wish that the waitresses were not required to dress slutty."}
{"text":"I have been to jack astors several times to eat, even with my family and my children . We always get the burger with fries , and it's always delicious!"}
{"text":"Service on Friday nights is HORRRIBLEEEEE. I will never come here between fri & sun again! I've asked for a glass of water 3 times. My sangria is taking more than 30 min to get here, and I'm extremely parched. My fiance's \"buffalo wings\" came without the buffalo sauce. We sent it back and the same wings came back - COLD - with sauce drizzled on top. Lobster and crab dip is getting smaller and smaller every time we order it. My smiling buddah salad is actually pretty good tho. Oh and the hostess was so rude and ignorant she didn't even ask us how many ppl we are with - then when I said thank you she ignored me and walked away."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Messed up on my order twice.  Waitress blamed the chef.  Promised to get the shrimp  that was missing from my order as a side order but did not bother getting it.  We came in a group of 15 and we were extremly dissappointed."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of the corporate atmosphere or the crowd it usually attracts. The pre prepared Cisco food is exactly what to expect. Salty, sweet and void of imagination and personality. The booze selection is very...suburban. Macro brews on tap and too much variety and not enough selection. Top shelf tequila is Patron which should be on any 20 year old frat boy from Oshawa's list, which judging by their patronage, is exactly what they are accomplishing.
The kicker is that I am very close to someone who works at a different location who loves this place. We went for some drinks to celebrate an obvious and very special occasion. The bartender there was critical of my friend's choice to enjoy some drinks there. So thanks for making that experience much nicer for us.
We traveled to a few other places to continue our celebration to which everybody else was very happy for us.
If it wasn't for all the sugar and salt in the food, I would have said it left me with a very sour taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I don't know how you can hate on Jacks! 

The atmosphere is fun and the people are always in an enjoyable and inviting mood.  I find this place packed Fridays and Saturdays.  This place has good music, good sports, and crayons to draw on the table with ( you know you want to draw).

The food is pretty decent, the selection has been improving over the years and overall they have something for everyone.

The only downside is that this is a restaurant chain, you are going to get the same food and service at just about every Jacks you visit.  So there are no surprises and I think this place is a good place to chill, have some fun and eat some pretty nice food."}
{"text":"Menu has decent variety for a chain bar/restaurant. Staff attentive, particularly Dan the bartender. Can get pretty noisy."}
{"text":"So I decided to come here to watch football in Sunday because someone told me it was a great sports bar....well. The set up was bad at the get go.  lots of the but some eof them were tuned to regular channels...only showed two football game on their smaller screens and the large screen was putting a soccer game...on Sunday..when most of the patrons were there to watch football...my group asked forbade game to be put on the screen nut they sailboat there was one guy that was watching the soccer game...he was actually on the phone and his tablet the whole time....and to make matters worse, the wait staff gave us attitude because we had the audacity to ask for it. Not a good place for Watching football. Can't comment about the food as we left before we could order..."}
{"text":"Meilleur pain à l'ail au monde! Mais service un peu lent..."}
{"text":"I visited this one tonight for a late dinner with my bf. The service was excellent and the food was really good. I ordered the wake n bacon club (i think this is how its called) and it was way better than the other Jack Astor's I've been so far. Definitely, going back there again."}
{"text":"Waited for 10 minutes at the front for an inexistent hostess. Seated ourselves on the patio, told the bartender we were outside. Waited another 5 minutes for our server to come. She came and gave us menus. Waited another close to 10 minutes while other servers walked right by us. We left. Worst service ever. I'll take my money elsewhere, thanks."}
{"text":"I'm surprised with some of the unfavourable reviews. I find the food consistently excellent and the service too. Probably my favourite steak place."}
{"text":"Just okay.  Buffalo wings good; but disappointed with their butter brush steak (dry, bland).  Will come back for other things but will forever pass on their steak; go somewhere else. We didn't even finish our entrée ; thats how bad it is. Paid $80 plus for 2 (1 entree, 2 entree, 1 dessert, 1 pop)."}
{"text":"Jack Astor's MacLeod Trail location can be found in Southland close to near by businesses such as Walmart, Canadian Tire, Bluefin, and Buffalo Wild Wings.

When I hear Jack Astor's I think of it as a pub/bar more than a restaurant but my perception has change when I saw that there are kids there so yes you can say it is a family restaurant to an extent.

My girlfriend and I went to Jack's today (4th of July) to grab a quick dinner and all I can say is that Jack looks different from your standard pub or family restaurant. Lined up in Jack's dining room you'll see \"funny\" pictures and signs. When I say \"funny\" I don't mean like funny haha but more like funny funny. They also have a ton of TV screens that shows majority of sports and a couple of JackTV episodes.

My girlfriend ordered the Chicken Parmigiana and a side of yam fries while I ordered the Texas Roadkill Chicken sandwich with original poutine instead of fries. The pasta to sauce ration is really bad. As you can see in the picture the pasta sauce is only a quarter size of the whole plate and mixing does bring out more flavour but the bow tie pasta alone is pretty bland without any sauce. The chicken on the other hand was okay. My Texas Roadkill was decent the only flaw I would have to point out was that the guacamole looked like it was barely added into my sandwich/burger.

For dessert we had their \"world's most ridiculously small brownie.\" I've seen smaller brownies before more like bite size so I know this is not \"ridiculously small\" as they advertise. The brownie is served with whipped cream and not vanilla ice cream which we found odd since usually brownie desserts at other restaurant includes vanilla ice cream. Overall it does have great flavour and great presentation.

Overall experience was satisfied. Hopefully we would come back for a second time."}
{"text":"Jacks is a Jacks is a Jacks. Its a place for a younger crowd to drink expensive beer and watch big screen TVs in the bar. Its a place for families to be as loud as they want in the dining room. This Jacks accomplishes what a Jacks is suppose to be. Food is good, restaurant is what to be expected to be a Jacks, service is hit or miss, but usually acceptable at minimum. Never had a major issue here with food or service. I will come back here if I am feeling a Jacks and I am in the area or if friends want to go specifically."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick bite and was not disappointed much. Got the blt poutine and the crab lobster dips. The poutine was no where near as good as the poutine choices from last year. Cheese was squeaky so that was well done. The dip has always been the appetiser I order. The amount of dip seems to have diminished from other restaurants but its still tasty. Good place! Could be slightly better though"}
{"text":"We ate here for a late lunch one day.  The place was practically empty, but our food still seemed to take a while to come out.  Everything was good, however, especially the sweet sauce that came out with the kids' chicken fingers.  We would go back."}
{"text":"I always bring my out of town friends to eat but today the service was horrible. The restaurant was slow and it took about 10 minutes to bring just water. We only had chips for my party of six and we decided to pay our bill for the lack of service. No one even asked why we didn't complete the order. I paid and will never return. Not recommended, very slow service and the manager was a no show."}
{"text":"Went in at about 5 pm on Saturday so of course its busy. Had asiago pasta was great. Gf had easy sell pizza not so good. Also had a stella and it tasted skunky. Music was too loud. Was not pleased at all. And too pricey"}
{"text":"Terrible service, wait times are long even when the place isn't busy. The waitress never returned to check on us. We often times had to wave around for her, or speak to another waitress.  I ordered a Caesar salad and I received very old, brown lettuce. They changed it...but the lettuce was still somewhat old. I would definitely not return to this location."}
{"text":"I usually come here all the time due to the fact that it's close, but over the years their quality has gotten pretty poor. Not just at this Jacks but other locations also. The other night just didn't seem to be like my night. I ordered a burger. The bacon was extremely burnt. They changed my bacon but the second time around my burger was very soggy.   The wait times aren't the greatest. However I did enjoy the drinks.."}
{"text":"I have been to many Jack Astor Restaurants and this location is by far my favorite one.
The service was really good we were seated quickly and got our drinks not long after.
The waitress was patient as we were deciding on what we wanted to eat. our food orders came fast and it was delicious. I cannot remember the waitresses name but she had pretty brown hair. 
i would definitely recommend this location and i will definitely return :)"}

{"text":"I came for lunch with a friend, her two grandchldren and their mother. My friend ordered pad thai, their mother ordered chicken and pasta, I ordered fish and chips. One child had chicken fingers from the child's menu. My fish was one headless whole fish of an unknown species that had little substance and came with more oily breading than fish.There were plentiful frys, overly salted and no cole slaw or other garnish except for a small dish of tartar sauce and one slice of lemon. The children's mother was happy with her small dish of bow ties and several slices of lightly breaded chicken. The chld with the chicken fingers had four overly dry chicken slices and several frys. She only ate one chicken piece. I was offered a taste of the pad thai. It was bland, the only noticeable flavour being too much coriander and I like coriander. The atmostphere is empty off- hours bar and grill with four TV's dominating the large room. The older child could not focus on anything but what was on TV. Forutanely perhaps by design the programs were sports and a nature program. At least nothing violent. There were crayons for the children to draw on the table and two chocolate brownies with some sort of white topping for their dessert. The only nice aspect of this meal was the second child received a dessert even though he didn't order from the chld's menu. I don't intend to go back to this location and I would go to another Jack Astor's reluctantly."}
{"text":"I went out for a late Sunday evening drink and a couple appetizers with my cousin her boyfriend. When we were seated the table was dirty and our server was nowhere to be found. Finally, she arrived and offered menus, right away she asked for drinks. She only waited for one of us to order and then walked away. She took a long time to return with the one glass of water and then I was finally able to order my drink. The drink sat for about 5 minutes when I noticed a fly floating in my cup. When I asked her to replace the drink she brought one back and the cup was filthy. At that point I was frustrated and completely turned off by the service and cleanliness. I thought to myself if I was a server I would have made sure the second drink I brought to my customer was absolutely sanitary. I felt as if my server purposely brought me another filthy drink. I had asked to speak with a manager who came over and removed the drink from my bill, with the service me and my party received I felt as if our bill should have been covered completely not just the drink. 

As we were getting ready to pay our bills, the server turned to my cousins boyfriend and made a comment about the scars on his face saying she liked them. I could see in his eyes how upset and uncomfortable he was feeling. I was furious that someone would say such a thing, I felt as if she was being ignorant. If you have nothing nice or good to say, don't say anything at ALL! 

My overall experience at this Jack Astors location is a nightmare. I wish I kept the bill for our servers name because both her and the manager on duty could use some proper customer service training. As per my cousins boyfriend that comment made him feel uneasy the rest of the night as it brought back horrific memories of the accident."}
{"text":"Was here on Friday evening with a group of work people.  We had reservations so they knew to excpect a large group, but the staff seemed a little overwhelmed that we were there.  Service was ok, food was memorably in the way that we won't go back.  i think a smaller group might work better or a good place for drinks and apps.   sorry."}
{"text":"Discussing service. Waitress watered down my white wine at the water station.  I then reasonably notified their head office with a letter and a few calls and never heard anything back. A shameful organization. Sad part is that I keep hearing of similar treatment at this location."}
{"text":"I love this place, the waitresses are smoking hot, food is great consistently, lots of TVs to watch UFC or Hockey, food is fairly priced, and its close the airport and major bus routes. You can't go wrong going here. Simple, affordable, accessible and the menu is a people pleaser. Go for it."}
{"text":"What can I say. No steak to make quesadilla 
Nasty bbq pork pizza our table of 4 returned.  Limp crust, bbq sauce and over cooked bacon
Got a side of guacamole that was maybe 2 tablespoons in total
Over all poor experience
Server was good"}
{"text":"food is not great here , usually cold / luke warm at this location
in general Astors food has been getting worst 
too bad"}
{"text":"I will never ever be back to a jack astors again for as long as i live. Went to this location yesterday at 6 pm with my boyfriend, noone was waiting to be seated. The hostess told us its first come first serve we will have a table within a few minutes. We sat down and saw people getting seated ahead of us that just walked in AFTER we did. We thought maybe they have a reservation. After it kept happening and we we're still not being seated, we went to ask one of the 5 stunned hostess standing there gabbing with each other, where we just got a blank stare to which then we walked out. Very unorganized staff, I've worked in the service industry for 6 years being a hostess is not that hard! Especially if its not busy. Disgusting  customer service will never be back! Sir cop fail."}
{"text":"Our firm almost always have socials here. Plus my colleagues and I visit this Jack Astor's sometimes on Fridays for lunch as well so i'm a regular here.

Service is good. Food is what you would expect at a bar & grill place. But I love this kind of friendly and upbeat place on fridays especially in the summer when you can sit on the patio. 

Don't forget to pick up a yellow lollipop on your way out - it's pina colada- flavoured!"}
{"text":"I went to Jack Astors a few months ago during the Soccer World Cup and I have to say that I had such a great time. I don't know if this is the case everyday but on that particular day servers were really friendly and awesome. The food is very nice, especially the Nachos with avocado (Appetizer). Overall the food is ok, not the best I've tasted but definitely not bad. Some dishes are a little pricey but I guess it's not too bad.
Great for groups looking to watch sports while having a few drinks."}
{"text":"I'm giving them a 3 star only because I love the chicken fingers. See the issue with Jacks is that I can never find anything I want on the menu so I always just pick the chicken fingers. It's cool to go have a beer decent vibe but tbh the menu is very uninspired"}
{"text":"This place is garbage. Trying to pay the bill and it is taking forever. Brutal. I will never come back here again.  The whole trying to pay the bill issue is retarded. Don't go here. Go to another Jack Astors"}
{"text":"+ nice atmosphere, + great music, + good local brews, + tasty menu, - noisy

Jack Astor's is a Canadian restaurant chain with branches in Canada and New York City. They are specialized on pub food with an international touch, which you can enjoy in a casual atmosphere. 

The branch close to St. Lawrence Market has an outside patio, large bar and restaurant area. They serve local and Canadian brews and have a quite attentive and friendly staff.

I really liked the music they played, which can be described as mainstream rock & pop and the laidback vibe.

Though the menu offers good fish, wok creations and steak dishes I went for the Smoky Jack's burger with their house salad and was not disappointed. The burger was juicy and the salad crisp, just what I needed after a long day of sightseeing.

As mentioned before they serve local brews such as Mill Street Brewery and Hop City. Try the Barking Squirrel Lager (Hop City), which is more like a red ale and very drinkable.

Average price for an entrée: $12-20."}
{"text":"Arrived here on a surprisingly quiet night (really nice out and other patios in the area packed) for dinner with friends. Service was quick, and the server was attentive and friendly. The food was excellent (definitely recommend the buffalo cobb salad). Consistent Jack Astor's experience."}
{"text":"Fairly good service and staff and food came quickly, but the food isn't anything to rave about, it was just \"ok\"."}
{"text":"The food here has never blown me away, but after the last visit I've decided I'm done with this location. 

The pan bread came out 2 minutes after we ordered and was cold. My husband's burger was drenched in mayo; gravy and fries were cold. When he asked for another burger without mayo an obnoxious manager flew over immediately to blame him since \"none of the condiments are listed\" so he was to assume it would be covered in mayo to the point where it is inedible. 

My chicken fingers were burnt to a crisp, and there were only 4 tiny pieces instead of the healthy ones they used to serve.

The waitresses here are stunned and care nothing about customer satisfaction.

Such a disappointment since the restaurants in Pickering are very limited"}
{"text":"Let's start off with the bathrooms. They were DISGUSTING. Toilet paper and water all over the floor and not much in the stalls, dirty floors and the soap dispensers weren't working well. Some of the toilets were not even flushed properly. The food was so so. I had a pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and a garlic tomato sauce. The pepperoni tasted weird and I ended up picking it off. My aunt had a salad and said that was very good as was the chicken club and Caesar's salad my mom had. My cousin has a quesadilla and she said it was okay just small and not worth the almost $15. The service was slow and the server had attitude. Overall just not a great experience and defiantly not worth the money we paid. Would we go back? Not a chance!"}
{"text":"Ate here with a friend and to watch the Raptors vs Warriors game. There weren't many spaces left so my friend and I sat in a booth side by side. Sitting side by side while trying to watch a game and converse is very straining on the neck, fyi. 

We ordered sweet potato fries, and a chicken pizza. Both items were to Jack Astor franchise standards. The waiter was nice and there when we needed them and didn't bug us after ordered.

Overall, good experience and I would recommend it to anyone looking for decent priced and quality tasting food. 

I wish they changed the Raptors game to the big screen sooner though!"}
{"text":"Nice place, lots of screens to watch sports. Salad great, burger wonderful, fries as well. Iced tea was not that sweet though)) and U need login and password from the waitress)) nice comfortable booth)) blah blah blah))"}
{"text":"Love coming here. Been going there for a while now and the service is amazing. They treat you right and make you feel like home. I love the tofu fajitas and the poutine they have. I will definately still come back."}
{"text":"Do not order steak from this location. They have no idea how to cook it. My partner ordered a medium rare steak. The first steak he received was medium well, so he sent it back stating it was overcooked. When a second steak was brought out it was CHICAGO BLUE! Drinks were also ordered and even though I ordered the same drink twice, they did not taste the same. The second drink came out far too sour. They are many places to eat and Yonge and Dundas, so I suggest you choose someplace else."}
{"text":"Smaller portions than before with no taste, it used to be delicious but not any more. They changed the recipe for most of the food for less ingredients and they raised the prices. The burger size became like a kids burger, the fajitas has less chicken and meat and more vegetables and last by not least, the famous crab and lobster dip became oignon and cucumber dip, don't try it unless you want to waste your money.
I am really so disappointed....."}
{"text":"Ive been to this jack astors many times. Usually after 6pm (packed constantly and very loud) but this time i went in the afternoon and it wasnt too busy or loud. I was pleasantly surprised. The patio was full though so we sat inside.

I love jack astors sangria, although I didnt know they charged extra for a tiny cup of wine, they give you the same amount for the small bottle and the big bottle....? and it was for 2 people. 

My mom loved her asiago chicken salad, (i tried it and thought the croutons tasted stale) I had the 7oz steak with garlic mashed and vegtables (veg were 2.58$ extra.....) the steak was really tough and expensive for what it was (could of went to the keg for this price) and they drenched my potatoes in garlic butter :( dont get me wrong i love garlic butter but it was just too much and hard to swallow. 

The service was decent, friendly and attentive, no complaints there. I would go back but Id order bar food not steak lol."}
{"text":"A jacked up not so pleasing to the visual on serving 4  cms of empty glass top ...  change the glass.  What does the regular serving look like ... probably unimpressive."}
{"text":"It wasn't anything special. My previous experience at another location had been horrible, and i had held off visiting another one for awhile. Service here was mediocre. I was just catching up with a friend in the area and we happened to grab food here. It was a weekday, so wasn't busy at all upstairs. The burger was good, and it was a good spot for talking/catching up with friends."}
{"text":"We brought our staff to this location for a bite and a few drinks. The atmosphere is great. Definitely the better of the Jack Astor's I've been too. Food was decent. Service was weird and inexperienced. Head waitress was rude and clearly having an off night. At one point she went so far as to say that she just got back from a long vacation and wished that she was not working? Ummm... OK. There was confusion with drink orders and she blamed it on us for switching seats with each other (we definitely didn't move from our seats). We didn't complain but I guess that guilt (or fear) kicked in and we were given a couple fried calamari appetizers for a table of 16 people lol. 

I'll return because of the atmosphere and will cross my fingers for better service. But based on previous reviews I will likely not get it. Employee attitude comes from the top. Doesn't JA know that?"}
{"text":"Came in at 11pm 'cause The Grille was closed. Service was extremely slow. Only two waitresses who seemed to be running around a lot and socializing more than taking orders. 10 minutes to get basic drinks, 30 more to get basic order of burgers and fries. 

Burger tastes like Burger King. Absolutely nothing special and very small portions. Fries were hot at least but again nothing special. Friend had chicken dish and was also disappointed.

No napkins at our table and recieved wrong drink refill. Waitress almost sneezed on me after inhaling pepper. 

Disappointed. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Fish and chips was amazing which isn't that common for big chains I've found. Good service as well!"}
{"text":"Kid friendly, great music, nice beer selection, friendly staff and good food make for a nice time!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this location, and was very impressed with the service and Natasha the manager who went out of her way to make sure we had a good time.  I highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"The good news: 
- Fresh bread with garlic sauce--yummy! 
- Burger was quite good 
- Outdoor patio overlooks the bustling Yonge-Dundas square 

The bad news: 
- Service was slow even though there were dozens of waiters running around all the time. Though we were seated quickly, I had to get up myself and get someone to take our order 15 minutes after arriving. 
- Garlic mashed potatoes were a disappointment. Should have gotten the fries. 
- No one came to refill my soda. Had to grab a waiter to do that. Then it took forever and when I asked again, they said, \"Large line up at the bar\". 

SUMMARY: We'll skip this place next time."}
{"text":"If you've been to a Jacks before you know what to expect. Service was great, food was better than expected, I had the tofu fajitas which was surprisingly delicious. My original order was sold out so she gave me a complimentary Caesar with my meal to Make up for it. No Complaints here."}
{"text":"Just went there with my friend.  Had an overall alright and decent experience with this restaurant. I ordered the spinach dip which didn't take that long to come to my table at all. The meal was in my opinion well portion sized for an appetizer and was quite tasty. The only reason that this review is one star shy is for the fact being we told her we needed a couple more minutes and which she took literally 20-25 mins to come back."}
{"text":"Couldn't believe that a veggie burger at a bar could be so good! It's a fun place to go with a group of people and the waiters/waitresses are really cool. Reasonably priced, an upbeat atmosphere with pool tables and great drinks, this is one of my favorite hot spots to spend a Friday night with coworkers after a long week."}
{"text":"I'll be brief as I have already reviewed another J A's location, I simply wanted to mention this upbeat downtown venue is an awesome bar to grab a drink and just have fun!"}
{"text":"soooo slow.... waited 15 min for a beer and 2 glass of wine... but i have to admit that the patio is pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Oh god.  Is there anything good on the menu?  Everything looks like it's breaded or covered in cheese (even the Cobb salad came with breaded chicken!)  I shared a wing appetizer with friends, but it was barely sauced and mostly tasted like oil.  We were seated indoors and could barely read the menus--the lights were so dim that one of my friends downloaded a flashlight app for her phone while we were sitting there just so she could see the menu through the laminate the restaurant uses to protect the pages.  

Desserts are cheap, so I ordered a sundae to make up for the disappointment over dinner, but the \"roasted marshmallows\" the menu touted turned out just be mini-marshmallows that came straight from a plastic bag and the chocolate sauce, that was supposed to have been spiked with caramel Bailey's, just tasted like Hershey's syrup.

I'll probably end up having to come here again because it's a convenient location and it's good for large groups, but next time I'll eat at home beforehand."}
{"text":"I was also in Nicole M.'s depressing V-Day dinner party at Jack Astors. I agree with her review - the service was pretty crappy. The food is fairly typical for this type of establishment. The men at our table, who had buffalo chicken wings, french fries and the garlic pan bread, were pretty pleased with their meals. But if you aren't looking to have a coma post-meal, you won't be as excited by the menu. 

I had the veggie stirfry, which came with lots of sautteed vegetables on rice. It was a little bland, but they bring out a jar of hot sauce/soy sauce to spice things up a bit. My mom ordered a spicy chicken stirfry, which looked a bit more exciting if you eat meat. Other family members ordered burgers/sandwiches, which looked pretty standard. 

If you're staying for coffee, they don't have espresso but they do have some 'spiked' coffee drinks. The coffee was apparently terrible, but I enjoyed my Tazo Refresh tea."}
{"text":"This is a fun spot for a late-night drink (good for groups), but the food is crappy and over-priced. 

If you're there for a few drinks or on the patio, I recommend getting an ice berg beer! It's a  pint of beer with a piece of flavoured ice that floats on top - and melts while you drink it so that it's kind of like a slushy beer. They have lemon or raspberry - I liked lemon better."}
{"text":"It's an OK place.

This Jack Astor's is in a great location next to the AMC theatre, and it has a good atmosphere, and is totally packed.  We had to wait only 15 minutes to get a table.  It was the inconsistency of the staff that was the most annoying.

The bar people are great!  Fast on the drinks, friendly, and since you were buying some drinks at the bar beforehand, they said they would go and see if they could get us a table faster.  They did.  The drinks provided were good, and for people that like wine, they have different sizes to order so that you can start ordering smaller glasses as the night goes on.  That is a nice plus.

This is where it became inconsistent.  The waiter/waitressing needs some \"attention to detail\" training.  There were many things (like water, drinks, and some food customization) that we had to repeatedly ask for.  I think they need to revisit their restaurant serving formula and update it.  The food was typical Jack Astor's - it was just okay - nothing special.  Portions are okay, but minimal in extra's that they should have thrown in.  Since I ordered the burger (which was done just fine), it came alone... on its own plate with nothing else.  I did get a soup with it, which came out earlier - it was the size of a tea-cup.  I was a little under-whelmed with the \"minimalist zen\" of it all.  My friends had the steaks, which they reported as good, so no issue there.

Like the other reviewer said, it is a great party place, and there are a lot of great looking people.  It is a poppin' place!  So I guess people come here more to get a good buzz going, and perhaps hook-up.  Being from out of town - I did not know that.

I would go again due to the atmosphere, and that the drinks were good, but I think I might have something more substantial to eat before I go, and focus on the bar area a little more."}
{"text":"The Smiling Buddha salad is SO GOOD.  It's my go-to dish.  I'll battle all the traffic in Square One to get this in my belly.  Generous portions.  I'll admit, I have yet to venture away from this winner.  

Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"It may seem strange to review a chain restaurant but I had to say something.  I have been to some of the so-called \"best\" restaurants in Toronto and many times the food is over-priced and under flavoured, the staff is useless and the crowd is just pretentious and boring.  As a resident of Downtown Toronto it was almost refreshing to find myself in a place where the food was good (and plentiful), the staff was friendly and helpful and the crowd was just, well, having fun being themselves.  All of this and the meal for two doesn't completely empty the pocketbook.  Nice."}
{"text":"Standard JA food, not gourmet at all and a bit pricey for what it is. Service can be very slow/unnattentive at times. Holiday menu for work function was very meh. So so at best. Great rooftop patio, though!"}
{"text":"A friend and I wanted a quick meal near the Scarborough Town Center - something between a lunch and dinner. The service was quick and friendly. There were plenty of beers on tap to choose from, and the menu has quite a selection as well. The food was good and warm, but a bit on the dry side."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Jack Astor's in different cities and the one consistent, the one thing that makes this place above average, is their pan garlic bread. It is far and away the best garlic bread you will ever have.

They serve soft, fresh bread in a pan to your table, soaked in garlic butter and cheese. It's almost overpowering at first lick, but the flavour grows quickly and you have to finish it after the first piece. It's so good, I saved a piece for dessert after my fried chicken and mashed potatoes (also very good). Even if you think you're full, there is always room for the garlic pan bread....

In fact, I've never had a bad meal here. Any of their chicken dishes are worth it and I've yet to be disappointed. The service last time was quick and friendly. Nothing lacking. The prices are more reasonable than some other chain restaurants, too.

But go for the garlic bread. Trust me...."}
{"text":"Very friendly and prompt service. Kids friendly. Steak always cooked to my liking (medium). One of my favorite hangout."}
{"text":"Amazing! That's all I have to say! 

I went with my family for dinner and the experience was amazing.  Our waitress was beautiful and knew had to converse with us.  The food was made fresh so it took a while for our order to come.  When it did the food was really good for the price.  All in all its a great place to eat in."}
{"text":"We were looking for something to eat late on a Tuesday night, after a Blue Jays game, and we were advised to check out Jack Astor's (I love the name: sounds like jackass-ster's). I was a little ambivalent to try it when I saw it because it reminded me of a T.G.I.-Friday's-esque chain. But, we decided to try it since it was late and we didn't really know our way around the city. Turned out to be a great move.

I was really surprised by the beer selection and food quality at Jack Astor's. I had a Halifax-brewed beer called Alexander Keith's and it was really good. For dinner, I had the fish and chips and was pretty blown away. They used really big, fresh, cuts of cod and they were perfectly breaded. The atmosphere was also pretty lively for a Tuesday night. 

I would definitely come back after a another game or so. I'm sure that there are better choices for dinner in Toronto, but this seems like a solid pick."}
{"text":"le service est long, pas d'allure. La nourriture est même pas bonne. C'est vraiment plate de dépenser 100$ sur de la nourriture qui n'en vaut pas la peine."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is ok, food is mediocre, service is consistently sooooooo slow, mixed up and forgetful. Not sure why I went back a second time. Won't make that mistake again."}
{"text":"Went here on a late night and enjoyed the wings and friendly service. Definitely will go back again next time I'm in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"Good service the place is not that busy for a Sunday night. Food came out good  and seemed fresh. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was good. My burger was fantastic. Good selection of food. Very lively atmostphere. I go here a few times a year and am never disapointed."}
{"text":"They have paper on the tables and supply crayons for you to draw with whilst you wait far too long for your food to be served. 
Food was decent, as the way of most chains now though, it's too expensive."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Food was alright but too expensive. 
I think I had mango chicken which was just a lump of mango with the chicken. 
Nothing special."}
{"text":"I came over here for dinner with family on Family Day and enjoyed the meal at a good price. Most of the tables were taken, however we managed to grab one within a couple minutes. Our table started with spring rolls, which were pretty standard. 

Then for our main course we ordered two fish and chips plates and one fajita plate. The fish was bigger than I expected, it was served with dip and vinegar for the fries. They were brought out rather promptly. The fajita tooks slightly longer to bring out, but looked awesome with the steam coming from the chicken platter. We all enjoyed the meals.

Then for dessert we had the Smores Sundae which was priced at $2. We expected it would be fairly small and ordered three, however we were surprised by it's size and probably could have shared one or two. The service was good, our server checked on the table occasionally and provided good service."}
{"text":"The food and restaurant itself are quite good with a good assortment of seats and it's usually not too busy unless you find yourself there on a Friday or Saturday night. However, my problem with this restaurant is the service. I've been here about 6 times in total and the service is really slow. They are friendly and nice, but it takes a long time to get started with a drink and usually even longer to get the bill at the end of your meal."}
{"text":"The food was very good. I have the ahi tuna and my friends had to eat chicken strips and the other person had to Salad. Our waitress was very friendly and because our order was a little slow they didn't charge us for appetizers. We didn't think our order was actually that slow but the manager came out and said they pride themselves on getting the food to the table together on time. It's nice to see good customer service."}
{"text":"Of all the Jack Astor's locations I've been to, this one is my FAVORITE. 
For so many reasons.
The food is mouth watering. 
Customer service is through the roof!!! 
And the beautiful staff are beautiful inside and out! 
No other restaurant makes me this fulfilled when I leave and I feel like I've spent my money on an experience, not just a meal."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly and had water on our table before we opened the menu. Food was good, hot and fresh. Our server was great - very friendly and attentive. Location is busy but convenient."}
{"text":"It's a great bar. The renovations look incredible.  The place is definitely more open and and has a happy social vibe. Drinks and food are great. I highly recommended the chicken lettuce wraps. They also have the best chicken club barbecue pizza in the city (get it with extra bbq sauce)..yum. Great time to be had always."}
{"text":"Expensive.
Disgusting oily food.
Not healthy at all.
Waitress asking too much to earn tip."}
{"text":"After a long day of site-seeing and walking all over the city we stopped for a cocktail and appetizers. The food and drinks were just what we were looking for (a quick pick me-up). I would recommend the sangria (large size and definitely get your money's worth) and sitting out on the patio when the weather is nice. 

Only negative was the checkout system was down and it took longer than usual to pay our bill."}
{"text":"Not bad, but I'll think twice before going there again. When five of us came there on Friday evening, we spent about 30 minutes waiting before they could arrange a table for us. I took pizza, and I was slightly disappointed with that choice, as it was too salty and lacked everything except cheese. Beer was good, though."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Laid back and casual sports bar. Extremely popular. I was in town solo and went to Jack's for a couple drinks. The bartender- Matt, was wonderful. Made me feel like I was a regular."}
{"text":"Whoever is reviewing Jack Astors as a good place to dine is beyond my comprehension. 

The only thing good about this place is they supply paper and crayolas to doodle.

Customer service here is great. That's as far as it goes. 

If you're use to eating crap food, do not overlook this place. It will be quite enjoyable for you."}
{"text":"Visitinf from Dallas, TX.. saw this place while driving by and by its apperance, had to try it out (lunch).

-has outdoor service with heating for cold/chill days/nights
-very roomy, very appealing, good TV's all around
-food was good, had chicken fingers medium
-service was hum ok, all i can saybis make sure you get all what you need when ordering, it does take them a long time to get blue cheese or mayo as well as having your drinks refill.. and nope it wasnt even a busy lunch.
-would try this place again, humm prob not."}
{"text":"Last Sunday I went to Jack Astor's with my daughter for Father's Day, I wasn't expecting much in regards to the food and....the food was just 'ok'. I ordered the Curry Bombay which was not bad but the rice appeared to be reheated and the chicken was a bit off.

Anyway, I was not coming here to write about the food but about how good the service was. Our servers name was J-D. Not only was he courteous, kind and incredibly pleasant it did not come off as fake or forced. He was an all-star and even presented me with an awesome Fathers Day glass after the meal. Kudos to J-D, he is an asset to your business."}
{"text":"Their portions are insanely small. I usually eat at Jack Astors either at the shops of Don Mills or Scarborough Town and compared to what I get there this is a joke. The hamburger's are so small. 
I ordered a buffalo chicken fingers meal and it looked like a kids meal. It was ridiculous. The chicken were the size of my pinky finger. The waiter also messed up my order and gave me regular fries instead of sweet potato which I ended then with both. 

I have no idea how they can serve this type of food and how people actually still eat there. 

Me not coming to eat baby food again."}
{"text":"The food was good. But the service was so slow. Also the restaurant wasn't even full. Way to slow."}
{"text":"If your looking for excellent service, great food, and a memorable dining experience, than please look elsewhere.

I would place Jack Astors in the same category as a Hooters restaurant in terms of service and food quality.  (Not that there is anything wrong with Hooters)  The point I'm trying to make is that you don't go to Hooters for the food, as you shouldn't go to Jack Astors if your looking for amazing food.

But if you are the social type, single, the people watcher type, the summer patio beer drinking guy/gal, ..... the Large Patio (with Patio Bar) will provide enough service for your needs.  

With so much going on around you the minor/major imperfections at Jacks, can easily be overlooked. Nonetheless, on a warm summer evening, Jacks should be an option as a place to start your night."}
{"text":"Love the Jack Astors chain. I find some locations are better than others and I had a positive experience at this location. Everything was great except our waitress brought us the bill without asking. I find that rude and unwelcoming but everything else was great!"}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for a glass of water. Server would rather finish his side duties before serving tables. Truly unforgettable. YMMV but I vowed not going there again, period."}
{"text":"Noisy. Noisy. Vegetables weren't sufficiently cooked. Had 10oz. steak which was cooked to my liking"}
{"text":"Conflicted between 2 and 3 stars.  Here's why:

PROS: Service was relatively quick to get our orders, and get the food out to us.  The place was packed, but there was no wait at 4:30pm on a Saturday afternoon, with a lot of servers about.  Food was okay, for the most part, and my alcoholic drink was tasty.

CONS: I see no point in having 3 scantily-clad hanging out at the restaurant entrance, when there were 2 more at the front counter to get us to our tables.  I could see that turning some females and older customers away;  If it wasn't at Yonge/Dundas, but at the Harveys few blocks east of there, people would probably get the wrong impression on why they're hanging out.  My meal was sauced up chicken fingers, unfortunately it tasted like they had been sitting for a few minutes, as the breading on the fingers had already turned to mush.  Use the people in front as runners, not just eye candy to lure frat boys in.

This shouldn't reflect on my feelings towards Jack Astors in general, I've had amazing experiences at both the Don Mills/Lawrence and Markham locations.  This was just not the atmosphere I was used to from there."}
{"text":"Before I start this review, I just want you to know that I dislike chain restaurants and especially American-style ones.  

That said, this place is great for extremely large groups of people who don't care what they eat.  The food is stupidly pricey for the quality.  If you like pizzas, burgers, wings, and watching television while you chomp down on the cardboard-stye food, then I recommend this place. 

I would recommend going with a large group of friends if you want to get drunk but please do not go for the gourmet fair."}
{"text":"This is another chain restaurant that really isn't worth heading to.

We were part of a large group and only had 2 pitchers of beer (1 rolling rock and 1 coors light). Our bill came to 54 dollars, wayyyyy too over priced in my mind for just beer. Also our coors light was warm, really not worth the money at all.

They do have lots of nice TV's and being there on a Saturday  during hockey season we thought they would show hockey, nope basketball everywhere. We asked the servers to change it but were given some lame excuse that if they change the big TV all the other TV's have to change channels too.

Lastly, the service was poor, saw the waitresses at one point in the evening sitting on the floor counting the cutlery when they weren't busy, very unprofessional. 

To be fair we didn't eat so I can't comment on the food."}
{"text":"Processed cheese-ew. There were way too many screens. You can't focus on the person you're talking to. 
Our drink orders were forgot multiple times.  
The waitress was rather rude too us. 

The atmosphere was nice but it tried way too hard to be \"hip\". 

The nachos were terrible. The vegetables seemed to be out of a can.  Cheese was very greesy.  

Will never be back."}
{"text":"I sat at the patio bar, which is pleasant in the summer.  Unfortunately, the service isn't very fast if you order something they have to bring from inside (eg, certain beers and cocktails).  Ten minutes passed between my sitting down and getting my beer.  Another twenty before I got the food, too.  And it wasn't particularly packed; there were plenty of free tables and seats at the bar.

I had the club chicken sandwich, which was tasty.  The food is a bit overpriced, but the location is convenient and the patio enjoyable.  I might be back again."}
{"text":"I gave it any star rating at all because our server, also the bartender, was a nice dude and was clearly trying. Our Shanghai wraps tasted like pure oil. The steak was solid cooked while we asked for a medium. My Shrimp tasted like they used salt as a spice - gross. I won't be back. Used to be one of my favorite chains."}
{"text":"I met up with some friends this past weeked on the outdoor patio of Jack Astors for a couple of drinks and a bite to eat.  I ordered two different beers, the first one I ordered was obviously not the pint I had selected, and the second, while the right beer was flat and long past its prime.  I had the chicken fingers meal, which was alright, the chicken was well cooked and the batter was weak, but the fries were cooked well and had a nice crisp to them.

My biggest gripe was the service, while numerous servers were patrolling the area they all seemed to be paying more attention to each other than the customers.

Poor service, poor pints lead me to planning on avoiding this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Nothing great about this place. Service was poor and the music was too noisy. The food was nothing to write home about. We ordered the lobster and crab dip, which was ok, except that I found it too cheesy. My husband ordered the jalapeno burger, which wasn't too great either. The only thing I would say was good is the bruschetta.

The drink I ordered was quite disappointing too. On this hot (36 degrees!!) summer day, I thought I would cool off with a refreshing blood orange sangria. It did not taste quite like a sangria. Also, I had asked for a 'jack up' (double serving) of the alcohol, but I hardly tasted it in there.

So for 2 appetizers, 1 entree, 1 sangria and 1 beer, the bill was $60. Not worth it at all for an unsatisfactory meal and poor service."}
{"text":"the wait staff is usually friendly, the food isn't bad, but i don't like: the stupid sexist outfits the female staff wear, and the horrifically loud music, which everybody is shouting over to hear the person next to them=even louder."}
{"text":"Came in last night with a group of 20. I was going to give another star for this review but they pushed our reservation back by 30 mins. We were very hungry from a paddling practice so we waited around for an hour and a half. 

The wait staff were attentive to our needs. They refilled my Iced Tea even when I didn't finish my previous one. All of our orders came pretty quick. About a 15 minute wait but we were entertained with the crayons so we doodled some inappropriate things. 

Food was ok. I ordered the Vodka and Soda Battered Fish and Chips. I found the fish to have too much batter. The chips were very salty. That was my sodium intake for the week.

Our bills took about 20 minutes to come after our meal was over. 

Overall it was OK. It was great for the company I had but the food was only meh."}
{"text":"Fabulous Manager, Darcy! Fantastic service! I contacted JAs, Saturday October 28th '17 because my Brother was traveling to Calgary from MHat to celebrate his BD & unfortunately I am away working in Northern AB, so I couldn't join in his festivaties. However, I called JAs to query if the staff would graciously wish him HBD, sing a song & light a BD candle. The usual embarrassing request that most Men would rather not have Women do, hahaha! My Brother & I started to share Tequila drinks/shots when our Father died, 29 years ago, and it's what we consume when he/I are able to connect, because Im residing in Calg the past few years & he rarely travels to visit. Darcy/Manager decided to surprise Tony with a Tequila Sunrise drink, which definitely meant very much to me, as I'm certainly it did for my Brother! Best Service Ever! I've been to JAs a couple of times with visiting out-of-town friends in the past & always have had great service + dinner! However, last evenings' chat/service by Darcy is beyond EXCEPTIONAL! I highly recommend Jack Astors, Macleod Trail, Calgary AB & am Appreciative of the Staff! Will certainly stop to express my Gratitude upon my return home. Excellent Job!"}
{"text":"Overall the food was good - I had a Caesar salad and the lettuce wraps.  They were good but not really good.  The service was also fairly average.   The staff was pleasant but they seemed to be on the slow side.  I think the biggest thing that made me uncomfortable is that I felt ill after eating there as did the other person I ate with."}
{"text":"When you come to Jacks, you know what you're getting consistently good bar food with great device. Tonight was no exception. We came on a Friday night and the place was packed. Unfortunately my fingers were cold. The server not only comped them, they gave me a second order for free.

This type of customer service inspires loyalty."}
{"text":"Our party of 10 made a reservation in mid November for New Years eve. 
The reservation was confirmed 4 times before New Years eve.  Four hours before our reservation time, we received a phone call from the manager saying our reservation was \"lost\" and therefore we could come in and stand in line and MAYBE there would be a table.
Jack Astor's just lost 10 customers and I have no problem in telling my friends about the unprofessional management."}
{"text":"First time in Toronto and this was a great choice! The Lobster & Shrimp Dip was absolutely delicious. The food is very fresh and tasteful. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Jack Astor's and I was came to this location when I was staying downtown with my boyfriend for our anniversary. We came in on either a Friday or Saturday night and we wanted to get a window seat but they were full. We were going to sit in the dining room and there was a security guard standing but the host counter that told my boyfriend he isn't allowed to wear his hat in the restaurant. We were shocked because it wouldn't be there first time there we have gone in sweatpants or even wearing the SAME hat. The security guard was a real jerk and ruined the whole night for us, even ruined Jack Astor's all together for my boyfriend to the point he won't go to any location. I really wasn't pleased because we've gone to the Jack Astor's right beside Union Station and experienced AMAZINGGGG service even with his hat on. I don't usually bring racism into a situation but my boyfriend is naturally VERY tanned and has a pretty wicked beard growing and being dressed in lowriding jeans and his cap on obviously through them off for whatever reason but we defiantly won't be back to this location unfortunately and it was probably one of my favourites because of the upstairs location and balcony style patio."}
{"text":"Nachos is the perfect dish for when you're not ready to commit to a whole meal, but want a little sumthin' sumthin' with your beer. I used to think that you can't screw up nachos. Jack Astor's you have succeeded in proving me wrong. 

The two separate times I've ordered the nachos, they came out disappointingly assembled, to say the least. The chips were quite stale, but what was more heartbreaking, was the stingiest sprinkle of cheese and mouse-sized veggies on top. I had about 5 good topping-to-chip-ratio bites, and the rest was all bare nacho chips. Sigh. 

Another thing that grinds my gears, why are your glass pitchers heavier than the liquid content inside it? I'm not sure if this is some phycological economic tactic, but I'd rather work out my arms at a proper gym.  

I love Jack Astor's branding and atmosphere, but comon, let's get some key dishes (like nachos) on par with the rest of Toronto, j'ah?"}
{"text":"My wife, her cousin and I went to the JA's near Square One last night and my rating of 2 stars reflects the courteous staff and tasty spinach dip appetizer only. The entrees were horrible. Firstly, I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with side salad and for some reason, it arrived on its own, even before the spinach dip. So strange to send out the side salad to the burger, but whatever, I just put it aside until later. When the burger did arrive, it was at best, OK. My wife and her cousin ordered the sausage pasta, in which sausage is a loose term as when you think of \"sausage\" in a pasta, it should be italian or maybe chorizo sausage. This was basically a kielbasa sausage (like a hot dog) that was cut up into this very bland pasta with chopped tomatoes and no sauce. Both my wife and cousin didn't finish it, and after I tried it, I find it hard to believe they keep this item on the menu. Our other cousin had mushy fish and chips, and basic chicken fingers.

This was almost a complete fail, if not for the staff and appetizer, but without question we won't be back. Keep trying Jack Astor's, you are definitely a work in progress."}
{"text":"Went for dinner at this location.. Had their Brie cheese burger, which was \"meh\" at best. Wouldn't spend that much money on a burger... Didn't even get a pickle spear. 

What really ticked me off about this experience was my date had ordered a soup, and they gave her sweet potato fries. Instead (which is an additional charge). We told our server, who eventually brought out the soup, about half-way through out meals. No big deal right? Well.. When the bill came, they billed us for a side of sweet potato fries. What were they going to do? Keep the fries and serve it to someone else? Pathetic..

They messed up on the order, and they charged us for it. I didn't tip the guy who served us.. I don't know if this was a rookie mistake, or he just didn't want to comp is a $2.99 side of fries when we spent about $50, but you lost out on a $10 tip just because of it.

Next time, I'll just walk over to Scaddabush. At least they know the basics of customer service."}
{"text":"This location has very low standards of cleanliness. I ordered a Diet Coke and it first came with little particles and a sesame seed. This was disgusting and I asked the server if they could change my drink. The second drink, which I drank halfway then noticed solid stuck on yellow stuff inside the glass. I felt like throwing up and would not be surprised if I get food poisoning from this location. It is not only very bad cleaning practices, this puts the health of the customers at risk. the cutlery I received was also dirty and I had to ask for a replacement. If the dishes and utensils they're using are dirty, I can only imagine in what conditions the food is being cooked in. The manager came over and claimed it was \"mustard\" in the glass, which doesn't make it any better. For all I know it could be something else and the glass was covered in bacteria. He said he will cover the bill, but this doesn't take away or make up for the situation as I am worried about my health and will never visit Jack Astor's again. He replaced the drink a third time, but I had lost my appetite at this point and didn't eat the rest of my food and when inspecting the drink a third time, notice little particles that looked like food or citrus. My Diet Coke did not have any lemon on it. On top of all of this, when I visited the bathroom, it had toilet paper all over the floor and all the stalls were dirty. I honestly feel like this location needs to be inspected as it's putting all the customers health at risk."}
{"text":"Amazing service & food. Really enjoyed my meal & I am definitely going back again soon."}
{"text":"Service here was very friendly and quick, always making sure we were happy with our food. As well, having a severe peanut allergy makes eating at restaurants difficult, but once telling the server of my allergy, he flagged the manager down. The manager then assured me that I would 100% be safe there and he'd communicate all of my needs to the chef. Because of this alone, I would go again."}
{"text":"Terrible slow service, not what I have gotten used to at other locations."}
{"text":"Came here after a soccer game with the soccer team for a table of 13 people just to grab a bite to eat and some drinks after an undefeated 4th game. Was seated almost immediately and the server came by and got us a round of water and our drinks. The lighting in the bar area where we were sitting was horrible. We had to use our Iphone \"flashlight\" app just to see. Once we figured out what we wanted and ordered it took a good 15-20 minutes for our food to come out. 

I ordered a California Grilled Chicken Salad. Beautifully presented however the dressing was a little too much. I also tried some poutine and I have to admit that their poutine isn't that bad. Definitely worth trying if you haven't. =) 

Overall, I had a great time with my friends. Good conversations flowing. However the service was slow but forgivable since our server was such a sweetheart and the food was just decent."}
{"text":"Our group was eating and drinking outside on the patio before the football game. They had the heaters on to take the downtown concrete chill off and were quick with the drinks and great food. We were doing some shots to premedicate our predicted loss and they had a great celebratory vibe with us! When I spilt my untouched whiskey my server quickly replaced it. Thanks for the great time! They instinctively knew to seat the fans of the same team in the same section so we could support each other. Clever staff."}
{"text":"Monday night at 12:30am and it's a perfect night to be on the rooftop, not a crazy amount of people but enough for people watch.  Bartender Trish (I think that's her name) was EXCELLENT.  extremely professional and friendly, shook our hands and introduced herself which is very rare nowadays.

We will definitely come back again, just moved to the neighborhood and this rooftop patio is unbelievable."}
{"text":"If you're coming here....expect nothing but a nice patio and by that I mean nothing- service is absolutely terrible, food is on par. Basically if you don't yell and complain don't expect your food to come out on time...just ask Steven the server if you don't believe me."}
{"text":"Our go to patio in the Dundas square area. A lot of the restaurants in this area have a very small patio and it's hard to find a seat. Here we've usually lucked out, plus the view is quite nice! Their huge umbrellas also block out all the glare from the sun which is the one thing that makes me hesitant of patios in the afternoons. 

Ordered the lunch soup special and a poutine, plus a pitcher of sangria to share. Only thing to note is that the sangria tasted weak compared to others I've had. The service was actually very good, maybe because we went on a weekday lunch but the waitress checked up on us at least 3 times after we received our food."}
{"text":"The service was sub-par (slow when we need it, too frequent when we were eating). Overall the food quality was cheap and it took forever to have our desserts delivered. I would have expected better given the restaurant wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"The Classic New York alone was worth the visit, but the service was great too.  My family enjoyed the poutine, calamari, and garlic bread and there was no leftovers to take home. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had a friend visiting from out of town, and came here for her to get her \"fix\" of Jack's Asiago Chicken Bowtie pasta.  She really enjoyed it, although the amount of chicken seemed a little skimpy.  I ordered the miso tuna bowl, but asked them to forego the rice.  This may be the cause of why my dish was so salty (not enough carbs to balance out the salty miso?)  But the tuna was seared nicely;  still raw in the middle - exactly how I liked it.  Prices at Jack Astors have gone up over the years, but fortunately, I had a $10 off $30 coupon (based on visiting another location earlier in the month).  This made our meals more reasonable.  

Service, as expected at Jack's most of the time, was friendly and capable.  The only strange thing was that we were brought our bill, before we were finished, and before we were asked if we wanted dessert.  Thus, when I presented the coupon, the server had to go and re-do the bill again.  Usually, we expect to be asked if we'd like to order anything else before being presented with the bill.  We were not long, and it was not busy, so not sure why we were rushed."}
{"text":"Just ok...2.5 stars.

Came here with a group of approx 15 (incl 3 kids) for lunch.  Due to the size of the group, I usually expect service to have some hiccups.  Overall, service was actually fine, until it was time for our bills.  We had requested separate bills for different couples/families (in advance) and noted which food orders should be grouped together.  When the bills arrived, there were quite a few mix-ups, despite no changes in the seating plan to when we ordered.  But the servers were quick to fix up the mistakes.

I had ordered the large chicken wings.  When my order arrived, I counted 13.5 wings (one was a broken drumstick).  When I mentioned this to others at the table, we decided perhaps the large wings order is by weight, not count, so I did not bring this up to the server.  It wasn't until I checked our bill that said chicken wings (15) that I realized with certainty I was shortchanged 1.5 wings!  My fault for not inquiring about it with the server sooner, but I did mention this to her while paying.  She indicated to me that she would have definitely brought out the extra wing had she known.

My boyfriend ordered gravy for his fries but never got it.  He actually forgot about it.  Halfway into the meal, the server mentioned that she noticed the gravy was still sitting on the servery, and that she had forgotten it.  And she confirmed that she took it off our bill.

The bill had a survey where you can win a gift cert to Jack Astors.  I entered the contest by providing feedback on our dining experience.  To my surprise, the manager of Jack's reached out to apologize for the short-change in wings, and asked for my address to send me something.  Not sure what it is yet as this occurred this week, but this is a nice touch.

We each got a coupon for $10 off $30 for the month of January.  With January being a slow dine-out month (post-holiday bills need to get paid!), this is a good way to ensure more business.  I've used my coupon already!"}
{"text":"EXPENSIVE!!!
I ordered 1lb of wings, garlic bread and cheese, and a diet coke. 
$30 ( including a $3.50 tip)
You have GOT to be kidding me. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times in the last few months.  Food has always been great, staff is generally friendly, but the place could get ridiculously busy and then the service is lacking quite a bit.  Steak fajitas are excellent, and the mini brownie is a perfectly way to finish the deal.  4/5 stars because the menu is awesome, food is excellent, but the service isn't great especially when they're busy."}
{"text":"Like another reviewer, I have been coming here for years. For a while it was my go to spot for some good chicken wings, calamari, and poutine. 

I like the atmosphere and selection of beers. 

However, this Jack's has gone through a rebranding and with that comes a new menu. The food is very mediocre, not that their old menu was any better but I really do miss the old menu. From the new menu, I got the chicken tacos which I didn't enjoy very much and I think they increased the prices for chicken wings...because it use it be by lbs, now its by pieces. Meh, I am going to stick to the other Jack's that haven't changed."}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant a half a dozen times a year for the past 10 years, and I can honestly say the service, food, and atmosphere has been great every single time. 

Let's face it, Jack Astor's is not a five star restaurant and should not be reviewed with those expectations. But for a place to get together with friends to watch a game, birthday celebration, or after work spot for drinks and a bite to eat, I can't imagine how someone would be really disappointed.

The food is mostly standard pub fare with chicken wings, burgers and fish & chips as popular favorites. But they also make fantastic chicken quesadillas, club sandwiches and pizza. Waitresses are always very friendly and are quick to check up with you to make sure you are happy, and wait times for the food to arrive is never very long except when they are really busy, which should be expected.

Overall a great experience every time over the past decade, and would recommend this location to anyone with the above expectations in mind. 

Grab a chair (and a crayon) and enjoy."}
{"text":"Small portions and expensive for what you are getting.  Pictures on menu do not reflect what you actually end up with.  My sandwich looked like something I would get from A&W but at three times the price!  The service is good.  Atmosphere dark and over air conditioned.  It's too bad, Jack Astor's used to be a great place to eat.  Not any more, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU CAN NOT EAT GLUTEN!!! 
Even thought they say they can prepare things for you, they are wrong... I went with my family and asked for a simple chicken breast, rice and veg. (I was trying to take it easy on them) 
I was served over cooked, dried out rice with a chicken breast so small I'm pretty sure it was a robin, and undercooked veg... I spoke to the manager who apologized (the one good thing to come out of the meal) and was told i would be compensated (clearly as I didn't eat anything) ...
Their way of saying sorry was by giving me a free desert (the only thing gluten free is ice cream) it came pre package in its own container (yay it was gluten free) but it was so freezer burnt i had to send it back... Got another ice cream and took it home with me and it was the same, freezer burnt.... 

So disappointing because the manager kept telling me how good she was at providing gluten free to those who need it..."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Terrible, loud club music at 4pm in the afternoon. Have to shout just to talk to the person sitting beside me. 
Only came here because it was one of the only places in the area playing the Jays game at the time. They have an abundance of screens playing sports but still pump the place full of dance music. 
After being seated it took ten minutes for our waitress to even come and greet us to take our drink order. 
She never came back to check on us after that. We decided on getting the bill right after receiving our drinks because we had a feeling it might take a while. We were never able to get her attention. Even after making eye contact on several occasions, she kept passing us by. 

Maybe because it's the tourist district, they need to amp up the \"experience\", but in my opinion, they're doing it all wrong."}
{"text":"One advice:
If you want to sit on the beautiful rooftop patio, make sure you take your oxygen tank with you. It's filled with cigarette smoke and no air circulation."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and food is good. I am in love with Jack Astor's cesar salad yummm~

The staff was very nice !!! My boyfriend and I didn't even have to say anything and they got us our drinks re-filled! 

The only thing I am iffy about regards to the waitress we got. I ordered a strawberry daiquiri and she didn't ask for my ID. All she asked was how many shots I wanted in my drink. I don't mind that I didn't have to show my ID, I just don't want her to lose her job because of not asking people since she is so nice !!

Other than that, the dinner was wonderful :)"}
{"text":"Been there twice. Ordered fajitas the first time and it was alright; for the meat I chose beef and it was very good but a bit salty. They also forgot to bring me any cutlery and I had to wait a while after already receiving food before a server came by so I could ask.

The second time I ordered the salmon salad and was pleasantly impressed with it's flavour. 

The second time, the hostesses greeted us in a very friendly manner, however I was unimpressed with the tiny uniforms the female servers wear. I went with my fiancé and his brother, and felt very uncomfortable to have our server chatting to my fiancé bouncing her boobs around in her low cut top and playing with her hair.

These were my first times experiencing jack Astors and I am in NO hurry to ever go back.
Sorry but I'd like to eat my food without seeing provocatively dressed women waltzing around. Save it for the clubs. How degrading is it that this is a uniform!"}
{"text":"There really isn't much on the menu at Jack Astors which has always disappointed me. But what they do have is prepared REALLY well at this location(I had a steak sandwich). I love the decor and the energy. No wait for a table on a Friday night and our server, Gus, was adorbz."}
{"text":"Manager is literally a nutbar.  Might have been a bad night for her and him otherwise just came in to grab a bit then l left frustrated and unimpressed....."}
{"text":"Mgmnt. Incompetent. Hostesses. Rude. Never felt so insulted.  Won't ever go back again. Thx"}
{"text":"It was okay, it felt more like a place for family and kids then to hang out with friends. The food is decent and the drinks are a bit too strong for my taste (I never thought I'd say that)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great (especially for sports fans) but the food is awful.  Sure with a chain like this expectations are low, but Jack Astor's lowers the bar further.  The salad made everyone at my table feel sick.  The staff, while mostly friendly, do not seem to care about cleanliness.  

Recommended for people: watching a beer with friends

Avoid: any food that can get you sick if not prepared properly

P.S. staff on the patio are MUCH less friendly.  They are often rude and snobby.  Someone needs to tell them it's a chain restaurant, not a Manhattan night club."}
{"text":"It's Jack Astors, what else can I say? The food is consistent with other locations. The best part about this place is it's the only place that ISN'T thai food in the area. Sometimes you just want a burger."}
{"text":"Garlic bread was greasy to the point where it looked drenched in grease, chicken parmigiana wasn't too great either. 

Our waitress was awfully rude and decided to throw our receipts at us after seeing that we didn't tip her. 

This is my first and probably my last time ever coming here."}
{"text":"We went here last night for the first time and we actually had a good time.  The theme is very upbeat and there are TV's all around the resturant.  The staffs are also very sociable.  The food is just like any other resturant you would go to.  The Ceasar drink is not that good at this resturant - it's waterdown."}
{"text":"This had to be one of my favorite \"fun\" places to go for a meal with my Dad. He took me here for lunch when I was a kid before I moved to Calgary, and was quite entertained by the Far Side cartoons lining the wall, and the canvas that was provided for my artistic ability! Admittedly, we haven't been there for a couple of years due to the fact he lives elsewhere now, but methinks it's time for a restaurant reunion!

I love the table canvas, the hanging chalkboard cartoons, the Gary Larson drawings lining the walls, the peanut shell lounge floor, and above all, the hot wings with the \"Smack My Ass and Call Me Sally\" sauces!

It would be a great place to go watch \"the game\", or hang out for lunch with friends. 

It's definitely worth your time to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great spot to hang out and have a few drinks after the game. Went here after seeing the Argos play and ordered some beer, calamari and beef nachos. The spot is ideal but the reason why it's a 3 and not a 4 is because the food is just average. The nachos were lacking cheese and when we asked for more salsa/sour cream twice, they somehow forgot. No biggie.

I'd come back just to grab some beers though."}
{"text":"So much struggle.

It's Saturday night so...okay, but...

Parking. Ugh.
Restaurant. Can't see my menu or my food. Can't hear the person sitting across from me. 
Food. Not worth the price, annnnnd they've taken off some of my favorites - the reasons I always went back: lobster crab dip and a pasta that has been gone for so long that I can't even remember what it was called.
Service. Not happy. The people I was with kept telling me they have other tables to serve and tend to, but I am paying for a service I wasn't getting. I had to ask so many times for water. For a table of 9 with 4 empty glasses, he brought back one water. I asked if we could just get a pitcher of water to make it easier since we were going through water so quickly but he said no they can't do that.

Just no.

We used to come here all the time, but over the years it's just constantly going downhill in every aspect. 

Not again."}
{"text":"The service is what I remember from this establishment. Everyone was on their game and it seemed they took pride in the establishment which should speak volumes about management. The food and drinks are typical of what seems to be a franchise restaurant, expensive and uncomplicated. Just a fun atmosphere and food that can be pumped out for people going to professional sports events near by. The negative was that the Wi-Fi was not operating and I was unable to connect which cause me to have to end my experience early. 

The music was extremely loud which became annoying. The problem was not that it was loud or tasteful but because the place was empty which probably cause it to sound more pronounce and made me wonder who they were trying to impress. The outside bar had a smell which kinda made me sick when sitting and watching a few games. This place is good place to grab a beer and some food when you need it to be simple and fast."}
{"text":"Best bruschetta EVER!!! Followed by a burger and sweet potato fries. Yummo!!!! 
Great service! Lovely atmosphere in the outside patio. Friendly, smiling faces!! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible food and service. Worst resturant experience I ever had. Only went because the Milestones had a longer waiting time, should have just sucked it up."}
{"text":"Went here because another mom loved her experience with her daughter, husband & friends at this restaurant.

We went on a very hot day and still got a seat on the patio with our stroller and little one. The servers were really sweet-sang \"Happy Birthday\" and presented my little one with two little pieces of brownie with a sparkler.

Thanks for making my little one's day a special one!"}
{"text":"it was okay.... can't say it was amazing.  Prices are high considering the food & drink you get."}
{"text":"Good bar food. Average drink choice. Not many fancy beers, mostly big commercial ones. Staff is ok, some nice, some dumb or dirty (won't tell story of one waiter completely forgetting clients while serving beers, I mean you don't cough in such a situation).

Space is nice with lots of room, bar tables, group tables and a nice patio well equipped.

The biggest strength is of course the location, at the heart of the city, not far from the Union station and the Rogers Centre and the Aircanada centre."}
{"text":"The waitress here are very friendly since half of my group that was with me went to a different Jack Astor's. The waitress would talk to us while we wait making sure they kept us company. 

The food here was also very good with a great burgers and the choice of all different kind of fries. 

They also have lots of TVs to keep anybody busy. It was maybe the day or us but when we went it was literally mostly empty barley anybody in the restaurant for lunch. Must be a great lunch spot tourist should definitely come here."}
{"text":"We went there on thanksgiving weekend. There was not much open, but they were. The service was fast and efficient. The food was ok: we had burgers and fries. Nothing amazing. The burgers were a bit dry. I enjoyed the eclectic ambiance. But the food quality was not that amazing."}
{"text":"you will have fun. very nice service, good central location. very busy during the weekend. everything from the menu is tasty. you can enjoy watching some good sport in the large TVs or if there is a live show in young/dundas square you can enjoy sitting at the patio and watching it from Jack's balcony."}
{"text":"Jack Astor's is a busy sports bar with plenty of tv's to catch all your teams in action.  On Saturday nights, huge crowds spread out among the many rooms.  Some of the Argonaut players hang out here after home games.  Outdoor patio bar is a nice option to get your drink on.  It's right in the heart of downtown next to many hotels and Union Station. Standard pub fare.  Not sure though if many go here for the food anyway."}
{"text":"Great wings. A good place to unwind after work and have a beer. Lots of tv's with sports on. They even have NFL games on."}

I went here for my friend's birthday dinner and everything was going good at first. Service was a bit slow to take our order and get food, but whatever.

They watered down my Mo-star, aka rum and coke, mainly coke. Thanks a lot. And the waitress spilled drinks on my purse and white wool coat. Thanks a lot skank!

The chicken fingers weren't seasoned, sauce was SOOO limey. Shrimp cocktail sauce was awful. Calimari wasn't good either. I don't think they season anything.

I also tried the chicken parm, the pasta tasted like butter and cream. No seasoning what so ever. Have they ever heard of salt and pepper? The basics. duh.


Anyways food was crap, literally. Wasn't worth the $17 tiny pasta.

We wanted to get the bill, asked at 11, got it at 12:30.

I asked 4 different waiters/waitress, they were too busy wiping desks to go to the computer and print a little receipt. NEWSFLASH.....JUST BECAUSE TIP IS ALREADY INCLUDED DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN GIVE US SHIT SERVICE.

I asked to speak to the manager, he said \"sure hold on\" Went to the bar, and avoided our table. This was for a freakin' birthday party with 30 people. You would think you'd care what we had to say or what we wanted.

Then when it was time to bring my friend's birthday cake out, she brought over 20 candles, the staff only put one in. They didn't even give us back the unused candles, they kept it until i asked where it was.

My friend asked why they didn't stick 20 candles in and the waitress said, \"we just didn't have time\" UM your restaurant is empty...

All in all

MANAGER SUCKS, WAITRESSES SUCK, SERVICE IS BEYOND SLOW, FOOD IS UNFLAVORED, DRINKS ARE WATERED DOWN.

{"text":"Went to jacks for the Team Canada semi final game at noon. We were are a party of ten. We made reservations and were given a really nice table. Being able to view the game from every seat. The new renovations are really nice. Opening up the bar for a more party like atmosphere. The bar was packed !!! Couldn't fit anyone else in there. I am giving five stars because the staff didn't even hiccup with anything. ALL of our drinks came out fast for 4 hrs. Ten people ordered food and were all pleased with their food and never waited longer than 15 min for it to come out. The bar was running like a well oiled machine. They must be well managed. Also having enough staff on hand is huge. Most places can't handle a packed house. When we arrived I had mentioned we wanted separate bills. All afternoon I thought they would mess it up as we had 3 girls serving us. Well I was dead wrong. All our bills came out just as we had ordered. I was amazed. Other establishments have trouble separating two people, let alone 10. My group had an awesome afternoon there and will be returning. I was super impressed and hope they can keep up with the outstanding service. :)"}

{"text":"Food: average 
Waiter: really friendly. Constantly checked with us if we needed anything else. 
Atmosphere: lively 
Location: convenient. 
Great for group of friends or grabbing a bite after a long busy day."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but honestly for the amount you're spending you're way better off going somewhere else. The portions are pretty sad."}
{"text":"Drinks and Food are expensive and average.

The wait staff has been great in my experience, really friendly, fast, helpful and in a lot of cases, entertaining.

The TVs (of which there are a thousand) are incredibly distracting.

Unless you're a big fan of chain restaurants, I'd recommend instead hitting up the nearby Friar and the Firkin or the Office Pub for food or drinks."}
{"text":"Silly me, I totally forgot to write a review about this location. However, can you agree that the fact as to why I haven't written a review, is because I rarely come to this location? Its true I tell you. Only when I come to University and Front St, is when I visit this specific Jack Astor's location.

Okay, so here we go. This would be my 3rd time, in a period of 5 years. 

My coworkers and I went to the auto show this past weekend, and since the weather was fantastic, we wanted to grab a drink after the auto show, before we headed home. On the way here, we wanted to go to the Loose Moose, but there was a huge lineup. Instead, we decided to \"hit up\" Jack Astor's. Upon entering, there was not much of a wait to get a table for 5. 

Upon sitting at our booth, we noticed that the table was messy, despite it being cleaned by the servers or bus boy/girl. There were drink remnants and the table was sticky. We informed our server, but I guess that she didn't bother. We had to inform this to another server, and then they came and cleaned the table. I don't know about you, but if I find a table or booth that is messy, and I ask a server to clean, and by ignoring it, that's just rude. 

As for the ordering process, there was no issues. They brought what we ordered, and kept on checking on us to see if we were okay. We didn't stay long here, as we only stayed for 2 pitchers. Upon paying the bill, I noticed that they had entered in the Golden Calamari. However, due to our dietary restrictions, we don't eat seafood. I brought up this with the server who took our order, and she disagreed with us. We were running behind schedule to head back home, and with that, I had to speak to a manager. I told the manager what our situation was, and that we NEVER received an order of Golden Calamari, but are being billed for it. The manager apologized, and took out that portion. 

Due to the above, I don't think we, or myself will be coming back to this location. Very incompetent, and I am not a fan of that."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting a lot, to be quite honest, but the food was prepared well and our server was super sweet and nice. I had the buffalo chicken cobb salad. I thought it could have used more bacon, eggs and blue cheese, but the chicken tenders were freshly made and yummy. We had the garlic pan bread with cheese, delish!  (pro tip: if one person eats it, EVERYONE eats it - there was a ton of garlic in it)"}
{"text":"This Jack Astor's is HUGEEE...and very, very busy!

There's just too many tables per each waiter/waitress. We got seated right away, which is a plus, but it took our waitress forever to just come by and ask for our drinks. By the time she did come by, we already chose what we wanted to eat. We took our order...and waiting for the food was insanely long. My two friends and I were starved after work, the long wait wasn't helping. We understood it was a busy place and that food takes time to be made, but the time they took was longer than typically would expect.

The waitress was extremely nice and apologized when she forgot to return back with my refill glass of water. She even gave a brownie dish to us as an apology, which was nice.

This location is nice, if you are around in the area. But, if not, I wouldn't recommend it. The one on Dundas Square is extremely busy, but they have much better service!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was good. Prices are very reasonable. Took a while to be seated and took a while for our food to come out. Loud and crowded.

But overall it was a good experience.

If you are rushed with limited time then this is NOT the place for you,"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and attentive. The shortboard veggie nachos were a nice starter size beautiful presentation and fresh and flavourful. The kids chicken fingers were very home made tasting and nice and crispy. The highlight for me was the holy smoke burger. Not from frozen, nice and juicy with lots of flavour and spice."}
{"text":"I absolutely HATE this place, I HATE it, I've been twice and I always get bad food, I think the servers take too long to bring the food to the customers, I can see it sitting there for awhile and my server is just chit chatting with her co workers and I'm just starring at her and I ask her over and suggest to her \"Oh, is that mine over there ? I hope so !\" and she says no, and doesn't even bother to check and goes back to chit chatting with her friend. Which was frustrating for me, because 15 minutes later she brings the plate I was eye balling and she says \"OH, you were right it was yours !\" and now my food is cold and icky, thanks. It gets worse ! one of the female servers starts to flirt with my friends boyfriend while she's in the washroom. I was shocked, it took me a moment to register what was happening. I understand why the men come here, yeah the girls are pretty but they lack service and common courtesy. Id rather have a staff who did their job instead of a bunch of attractive girls standing around or even hitting on customers boyfriends. plus, im not a fan of the décor, its very tacky to me. 

The other locations I find that the staff is much more friendly and attentive.

LSDR: DO NOT EAT HERE, THE STAFF IS CLASS - LESS
service = 0/5
food=1.5/5
cleanliness = 4/5"}
{"text":"Woah wait! I haven't reviewed Jack's yet? Crazy!

This is basically the only place my friends and I go to have dinner for the past oh, 5 years. We used to change things up and go to BP's or Moxie's once in a while, but lately it's been Jack Astor's and only this place. We were actually here the day they had what I believe was an electrical fire and had to shut the restaurant down, fun times!

So would I say this place is amazing? Not really. There are certain things on their menu that I would personally avoid (mainly pastas). Can't complain about anything else though. My typical choice is the chicken fingers or the chicken club sandwich. I did go crazy once and got the lobster crab dip which was good. I noticed a salmon salad on the menu that looks good too. The prices for all their items are pretty good too. They have some cool drink options as well, but usually I'm the driver so I don't get to enjoy them. It's kids friendly too, the crayons and paper table cloths is sign one that it is (the crayons are fun for all ages though). It's weird though that it's so kids friendly that kids can sit in the lounge, that's just wrong.

All around I usually have a good experience here. Good service that brought the food out fast but didn't make us feel rushed to get out, good food, and all around good times. Their signs that hang about the restaurant are funny and frequently updated so it's fun finding the new ones while sitting around.

So here's some of the downs: My most recent visit was horrible service. I ordered the chicken club sandwich but wasn't asked if I wanted fries or salad, has something changed? My fries weren't that great either, pretty soggy. Then the waitress gave us our bills right after we finished eating and didn't ask about desert, which we wanted. When she brought our desert she also brought our new bills with it. Basically it felt like a big kick in the ass trying to kick us out. The music seems to be louder recently making conversation hard. Wasn't asked for a refill even though i would have liked one. Although the Jack Louis is AMAZING, I miss the apple pie. Bring it back!!! Seriously, my friends and I always say \"Apple pie today!\" and have our heart broken again when we realize it's gone. Oh and the new Elvis booth kind of creeps me out.

I know for a fact I will be back at Jack's, but I hope this bad service was a one time thing because if it keeps up I'll be greatly disappointed."}
{"text":"Go here if you want the most disgusting Fajitas that you have EVER experienced. Mexicans would all roll over in their graves if they seen Jack Astors version of Fajitas. Unbelievable!  
The service - the hostess was totally unfriendly and couldn't stop yawning at 6:30 at night?  The waitress was friendly but we had to go get cutlery ourselves when the meal (?) came.   Would never in a million years go back there again."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch on may 30th 2016 at 1145am. We sat in the patio.  The atmosphere was nice. Husband order the burger and I order the tuna avocado sandwich.  We also ordered calamari.  My sandwich was OK.  His burger looked fine until he opened it up to add in some ketchup.  For a $15 burger you would think they would use fresher lettuce.  As u can see from the picture it didn't look too appetizing.  We won't be returning here again."}
{"text":"Usually i have a decent time at JA's. But this time was bad. Service was slow for a Thursday night and there being hardly anyone in our section of the restaurant apart from us 8. we ordered the plain tostitos with 4different dips. the tostitos were hard to chew almost raw even! then came the mega nachos appetizer. and they were raw/stale as well! so we inform our server and after he checked with the kitchen he says, \"yes they are definitely weird. they are stale. the problem is they are made in the morning and so theyre not so fresh now. \" i appreciated the honesty. so then the manager came and said the nachos were indeed raw and agreed that \"they don't look that great.\" so whether they were raw or stale, it had sort of upset us coz nachos chips are kind of a staple in this place so this was v unexpected! they didnt charge us for the nachos but i was surprised they charged us for the tostitos/4 dips item. not that i wanted it to be free of charge  becoz we did eat it (we were really hungry and engrossed in conversation!), but they could've taken that too off the bill bcoz it was a genuine fault of theirs and tostitos chips are not a costly item to make like steak for eg. or they could've offered us a free dessert to make it up to us. I've been to restaurants where the servers genuinely want to help improve your experience but this wasn't the place. at least not this time."}
{"text":"i have yet to dsicover what to order at Jacks - i mean an entree. Gone are the days of unlimited pan breads - to DIE for!!!

this is a good location - yonge and bloor needed a bar like this- really close by the main subway location.

However, i find the restaurant dark and dull. They have a nice little patio on the outside but somehow the location isn't quite visible from the street level.

i will keep giving Jack's another try and take pointers for food from below..."}
{"text":"I go here with my friends to watch the UFC fights.  The experience can vary depending on where you are seating.  The watching portion is pretty good from most positions, but audio can be a  challenge if you are forced to sit in the back.

As far as food goes, it is typical chain restaurant stuff.  Jack Astors, Turtle Jacks, Kelseys, Caseys, blah blah... can you really tell the difference?  All their menus are practically identical.

One small piss off though:  cocktail drinks are not strong enough.  Can't the spirits at all.  Now I am forced to drink beer and belch like the  guys."}
{"text":"Great location and beer selection.  Nachos were bland and without much too them.  Service was good and waitress even plated one entree for the two kids to share.  Overall the entrees were average."}
{"text":"Great and affordable place!  Large selection of appetizers on their menu and the food I've tried so far has been very tasty. I like to sit outside, in their terasse, during the summer, inside can get a little loud."}
{"text":"Was there last week for a Birthday party of 10 couples. 

Planned in advance, and everyone was excited. 

Server also did not allow us to order 12 shots for a group of 20 people, And then went on to say not to ask her again. She was consistently rude and confrontational with all of our guest.

Approached a manager, he acknowledged the server was at fault but did absolutely nothing to rectify the situation. Half way into our dinner we asked for the bill and paid for everything including food that was not yet ready. 

Management is horrible! They will never receive our business again. 

This is review 1 of another 19 that will be coming shortly from each and every guest. 

Jack Astors on queen street you lost a long time customer.

Thanks"}

{"text":"Attentive management. Bar staff makes effort to learn patrons names, especially C.J. I ordered the Italian Meatball sandwich (pepperoni on top!) which is a handful but delicious."}
{"text":"I love Jack Astor's, but I really love the Newmarket location. The staff is super friendly and efficient, the food is consistently good and flavourful. On the very odd occasion that I've complained about something (twice in 5 years and at least 50 visits (I am being conservative on the number of visits)), it has been rectified right away and completely taken off our bill one time, with the manager's apologies personally delivered. That I find refreshing, quick acknowledgement and solution. The atmosphere is casual, they have music playing, but it's not so loud as to be distracting. You can have a conversation at normal voice level. Every time we go out and wonder where to go for dinner, more than likely, we end up there. Their menu is varied enough, that there is something for everyone. The only thing  that I am upset about, is that they don't have crispy fries anymore.....they were the best!."}

Do yourself a favour and find another spot to drop your hard earned $$$."}
{"text":"If there was a title for best (fresh) chicken tenders (or fingers) in Montreal- Jack Astors would be in the Top 3. Fresh batter, fresh chicken, and fried to perfection with a nice side of crispy fries and a variety of dipping sauces to chose from. Other notable items are the fish and chips, for obvious reasons... the batter is, their own recipe like the chicken fingers, which is to say, fantastic (not too light/not too heavy) and is fried to perfection- the cod they use is good quality and seasoned properly- so it never tastes bland on the interiour. Also, changing it up with sweet potato fries(for 0.50$) is a good call, though I'm not a fan of the smoky \"bacon\" (or whatever it is) dipping sauce they serve with it- so I just ask for reg. mayo instead. This is not a \"burger joint\" at all, nor does it try to be. Go for the Jack Astors classics to avoid dissapointment, because they have tended to get a little too fancy with their menu- but it would seem with good intentions to offer a lot more options for customers, which is nice. They do a lot of asian/texmex fusion that is enjoyed by many people. Also, many beers to chose from on tap, but an almost absent selection of domestic micro-brews from Quebec. The service seems to be always friendly and profesional, because they're used to smoothy turning tables for a lot of the corporate crowd that packs their place for 5 a 7's and business lunches. I never had a prob with the service, but I find they can reduce the amount of exposed flesh from time to time. But all in all, a solid suburban resto for an enjoyable casual bite with a beer! The one on Sources is practically a West Island institution at this point. I remember when they first opened they would light-up the sign with strong neon lights that would highlight the outline of the donkey's ass (in the logo); while, flashing lights on only \"JACK\" and \"ASS\". Well of course, this didn't last for long- between the various complaints from people in general and the eventual crackdown by the OLF. That was viral marketing before social media.

This place is best for those days you feel like having fastfood and you make the wise decision to pass on the fastfood you pay little extra to upgrade the food quality and order real drinks with your meal like an adult."}
{"text":"went to Jacks in Pickering...don't know if the staff dress code is the same at all  locations but my family was thoroughly disgusted...did we just wander mistakenly into a PENTHOUSE restaurant or what...I mean the outfits the waitresses were wearing makes Miley Cyrus look like a church choir singer. After seeing that ones outfit was so stripper like,not to mention the very very poor service, we left. The owner of this establishment must not be a married man or perhaps his wife is an exhibitionist. Perhaps a name change to Jack ASSCRACKS would be more suiting.SHAMEFUL"}
{"text":"What a disaster this place is. My daughter and her friends made a reservation for a birthday dinner. They arrived and were told their table was not ready. One hour and 25 minutes later they still were not seated. When they asked why other people were being seated they were told those people were priority. What? Since when is having a reservation not priority? They left and went to milestone 's. The bottom line is Jack Astors you hire people that cannot do their jobs. I worked in the restaurant industry for years. No offense it is not rocket science. Seat people, feed people.....repeat. You could not even get the seat people part correct. Sad. Says a lot though. Money better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Drinks and food are alright. nothing spectacular.
wait staff has been nice and friendly.
always kinda busy, casual.
Only thing is the THOUSANDS of TVs that are way too distracting and wait staffs won't change the channel of the TV that's right in front of us so we had to watch some other TV that was couple seats away from us."}

I was very sasitfied in general."}
{"text":"I just loved this place! Went for dinner with husband and two kids. Service was absolutely awesome, really outstanding. Waitress was attentive, friendly, and super helpful. Even one of the managers came over and had a chat as he'd heard we recently moved to the area from overseas and just wanted to say hi and welcome. 
The kids were well accommodated yet the atmosphere in the place was still full of energy and you could enjoy yourself with a few drinks and great food regardless of kids. And yes, the food was lovely! I had the buffalo cob salad and it was so big I couldn't finish it but so delicious I had to take the rest home. The cheesy garlic bread was immense! And the dessert, wow, I'm glad I kept some room, it was great too! We'll definitely be back, even just for the excellent, friendly service!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Called ahead and food wasn't ready. I got no acknowledgment at the bar as I was trying to it pick up, the two female bar tenders pretended not to see or hear me. It's like they don't care if you ever come back. Serious lack of management. Would give no stars; there are other places nearby that are happy to serve a customer, thus I won't go back."}

Thankfully our gracious server, god bless her (I wish I remembered her name),understood our frustrations and accommodated with a larger nachos serving. Service - 10/10"}
{"text":"The food was ok and arrived quickly but the portions were far too small considering the cost."}
{"text":"I usually keep my distance from chain restaurants, but this particular Jack Astor's is a bit different from the locations they have in the suburbs. the restaurant has a downtown ambiance and it actually feels kind of hip considering it's right across from Union Station ... even though the food choices are not spectacular I can definitely  recommend it for business lunches on weekdays and to tourists looking for a place to have a quick bite before exploring downtown ..."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to the Jack Astor's Scarborough location. I order the famous chicken fingers and fries with the medium hot sauce on the size. I know Jack Astor's says their chicken fingers aren't from frozen but when I got them tonight, they seemed pretty dry and not juicy at all. It could be that the chicken fingers that I was served were cooked for too long and that dried them out or it could just be this location. 

And there was hardly any meat inside the strips, it was mostly just breading. 

I'm not sure what happened. And the music was turned up too loud that it was hard to hear my buddy, who was sitting in front of me, I would constantly have to repeat myself when having a conversation, even the server had trouble hearing our orders."}
{"text":"One more to my favorites! If you're a meat lover well that's the place to go! Funny employees, funny menu and a really nice and cozy ambience. The service is fast and personalized to your liking. And good for your wallet! What else do you need to good there!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Came here on a weekend and dined in the bar area with a friend and the server wasn't friendly and didn't even check on us like how other servers at every restaurant normally do. The server didn't even introduce her self or else I would've noted down her name here. 
I would not recommend this location at all.  this is not the first time I've had bad experience. I've given this location many chances but I will now change locations of the jackastor I go to.. I would rather drive farther to a better location who treats me right rather than be in a place where they don't care or treat you rudely with attitude."}
{"text":"Saturday Night, around midnight, some friends and I want to have a quick drink after dinner and catch up before we head home. We met at Ryerson, so we thought it was fitting to go somewhere in the neighborhood. We should have stuck with the Library. 

Jack Astors on Saturday night more resembles a nightclub than the 9-5 lunch crowd that I am more used to. Complete with the-dark-suited-early-twenty-something-manager approaching my friend to ask him to remove his BlueJays hat as it does not fit within the DRESS CODE. Really? Is JA not in the same league as Olive Garden? Regardless  The patio is gorgeous, and it was fun to get the view of Y&D from up there. 

CLEARLY the crowd is 905ers and tourists. Nightclub beats are blaring, the scantily clad wait staff is asking us if we want to jack it. My \"wheels on fire\" Ceaser was unbearably bland. 

Not a fan anyways, but the dress code bit was ridiculous. Two Stars for the Patio."}
{"text":"This place is ok. It's usually busy, but it's not amazing. 

There are TVs on most of the walls, and some chalkboard posters with puns on the walls. There is also paper on the tables and you're supplied with crayons, so you can doodle while you wait for your food. And you will be waiting. 

The servers aren't exactly attentive. They look like they're really busy, which is nice... But I just want to order... You know? 

The food is just ok. The garlic pan bread you can get as an appetizer is pretty good, but nothing else is noteworthy. Just your standard fare, done mediocrely. 

I guess this is more of a sports bar, but some of the TVs have a very arbitrary collection of short clips. Some of them are weird or funny, so it can be entertaining to watch. That was a good idea. 

So it's an alright place to get some food, but I wouldn't go out I my way."}
{"text":"Service was slow, mash potatos were watery, and no check ups for water refills.  I may be basing off just 1 server but food took forever to come out on a none busy day."}
{"text":"This review is coming from an avid bar go-er/patio loving/30 year old female.  The review is long, but this is over a few attempts/experiences.

I was really looking forward to this location opening up, as I live in the area and there aren't too many good spots in the area.  I was a complete supporter, even followed their facebook page and encouraged my friends that \"this could be our new spot!\"  I personally enjoy Jack Astors in general, so it would take some swaying to make me not want to go back.  But oh, did this location ever push me away.  I have experienced and heard nothing but bad things about this place.

A friend and I went the first week it opened just to grab a couple beers.  The staff seemed nice enough, but we had to wait about 30 minutes to get a seat at the BAR, only to have them put us at a shared table.  While we were waiting for the table (no seats, just awkwardly standing in front of the hostess) the security guard told my friend there was a dress code - meaning his hat could not be backwards. (Mind you, we would've fit the \"dress code\" for other Jack Astors locations.)  So he moved his hat forward, and sure enough he fit the \"dress code\".  Our shared table was at the back of the bar, where the employees often decided this was the best place to show how fun their jobs were by dancing up on each other and \"WOO\"-ing.  I get that they are trying to hype up the crowd, but there were sports games on TV, it was just embarrassing to watch.  Though the waitress encouraged us to come back, because they have an amazing patio that is heated all year round.  I asked if we could call in advance to reserve seats, to which she said 'Yes, absolutely!!'  I thought that was cool, because most busy Jack Astors don't allow you to do that.  Which ended up being true here too - so, she lied :D

So the other times I've TRIED to go, I've called in advance asking how the patio looks, as in very busy, etc.  Every time I've called I've almost been lectured, or rushed off the phone with them repeatedly saying \"It's a first come first serve basis, people have been here for hours, people get here really early\"  etc.  Hmm, guess I don't plan ahead enough to experience their patio.
I also ended up going here as well for a corporate event, where we had a large group and set menu's.  BAD - they got everyone's orders wrong, some people's orders went missing, one person even only got their entree when others were finishing their dessert!  They comped us all with a free appetizer at that location - to which many people laughed at, since they would not be returning to that location.

I tried to go again yesterday (seriously, I think I'm a very forgiving person) - we were a group of 7 looking for a seat on the patio.  The hostess told us (word for word) \"We are at capacity.  I mean, you COULD go up and check, and maybe wait around at the bar up there.  But for 7, you're not gonna get a seat.  So I don't recommend it.\"   So we took her advice and didn't check since she said we weren't going to get a seat anyway.  


All in all, I'm not trying to hate, but they have made it very difficult someone who wanted to support them to actually be able to.  They continue to maintain this douchey attitude, yet don't even have the service to support it.  If I ever do make it on the patio, I will write a new review.  But until then, remember folks - first come first serve, only the lucky are allowed in!"}
{"text":"Spent New Year's Eve there with family and friends.  Good food and friendly service.  Overall great experience."}

{"text":"Unfriendly welcome. However, the waiter itself was very friendly. Depending on where you sit in this location, the level of noise could be troublesome. 
Good food for a sports bar - try the Cesar Salad and the Chicken Fingers as a classic. But 2.99 for 1 glass of Coke?"}
{"text":"You know you're not coming here for a fine dining experience, but you would at least expect the bar food to taste ok. Every single thing the three of us ordered was just plain bland. Or not very good. 

Service was pretty bad. It wasn't the fault of the servers, they were running around like crazy. I guess that it generally indicates the chaos of how this place was run. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Very impressed.  Food quality was excellent and reasonably priced.  Chicken fingers are excellent.  Food is very fresh and well prepared.  Would avoid the Thai summer rolls because as delicious as they are, one would need about a dozen to feel like it's a meal.  I plan to be a regular here."}
{"text":"Went here awhile ago with 30 people, we had a blast; we didnt order food but we did order a lot of beer an shots to the point I myself couldnt walk; we had a lot of people on the secound floor but had to transfer to the bottem floor to get the booze flowing an the party going. Will come back for the food dine later in the future but a great place to have a blast with a large group of friends"}
{"text":"The food is surprisingly good but the service ALWAYS takes so long,  even when the place is mostly empty. Every time I've sat upstairs our  server has seemed to disappear for an unusually large amount of time."}
{"text":"Ordered the nachos with beef chili as an appetizer and it was pretty good. Guacamole was okay but have had better elsewhere. 
As an entree I ordered the Bourbon Street steak with shrimp dressed in a red pepper sauce and mashed potatoes. The steak was ordered medium rare but received medium and was quite tough to eat towards the end. Shrimp was quite good and the mashed potatoes were great. 
The s'mores sundae for dessert was very good although there seemed to be way more chunks of marshmallow than vanilla ice cream.
Overall the food was fine. Went to use up a gift card but there are more enjoyable places to hit up in Mississauga for the same price points."}
{"text":"Food is okay as well as the seating arrangement nothing special though, staff is fairly freindly and they have a good selection of food bit nothing stands out (as I said earlier) 

It was about a twenty minutes for 4 people to get there full meal which Is pretty decent for my family and I, speaking of family they enjoyed it as well although where we were sitting none of the televisions were in our view

If anyones going there expecting a unique experience don bother, but still a good choice if your looking for a meal after the theater,laser tag or any of the other activities in the area 

might stop there again but wont go out of my way

(On a side note we had to wait fifteen minutes for a booth)"}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot but it's been years. We came here in the middle of the week but I guess since this downtown location is a place to hang out after work, it was packed!!! It's the first time I've been to this location but it is a lot bigger than I thought, it was a maze walking to our table. There were a mix of work functions and friends gathering around to watch the Leafs game. We were starving so we started off with the spinach & artichoke  & goat cheese dip. It was good but then I was already starting to fill up.

For the main, I had the deluxe cheese burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was huge, it was a thick pattie. The burger was alright, a little dry but it was filling. The sweet potato fries was spicy and smoky. The chipotle dipping sauce had a great kick. I was rolling out with my stomach when we left, had to had a slow walk back home."}
{"text":"Good food & nice music way better than TJ's the drinks are really good and lots of TV screen"}
{"text":"Basic menu but food I'd good. Restaurant can get noisy so make sure you don't mind that type of atmosphere"}
{"text":"Pathetic lunch - kid's nuggets were burned, burgers were cold and a quesidila  was yuck. Manager was courteous and adjusted bill but we will not return to this location."}
{"text":"We arrived at 7pm and asked to be seated in the bar to watch the All Star event.  We were put on the waiting list and given a buzzer. After 30 mins a couple walked in and seated themselves at a table that was just cleared in the bar. When we complained, we were told the couple wasn't supposed to seat themselves and we needed to keep waiting. Then a manager came out, we assumed it was to ask the couple to get in line.  Instead, he left the couple and then seated another group that came in several people after we received our buzzer.  We then went to the front to return our buzzer and go somewhere else.  When we tried to explain why we were leaving to the manager, none of the staff, including the manager were apologetic. We could have chosen to go to any other number of restaurants but chose to go to this Jask Astor's.  By the time we left (because there was no way we were going to give this restaurant our money) it was 7:45 and we couldn't get in anywhere on time for dinner to watch the event... so, thanks for ruining our evening.  Next we'll take our chances somewhere else and remind everyone else to do the same."}
{"text":"Went to eat and watch the Leafs playoff game. All Leaf fans their to watch the game but they would not put the volume on or broadcast and instead played Aerosmith and Bon Jovi on loud speakers.. :) many people upset and left. If you want to watch the Raptors or Leafs in Playoffs don't go to Jacks!"}
{"text":"5 stars because the location of Jack Astor's does make a difference

A chain, the food tastes should be consistant, you can use the same ingredients but if one prepares it sloppy, it will be just that sloppy food.

I've gone here several times this Fall Oct - Nov 2010 the food has been prepared well and tasted great. 

Bar drinks good as well. Jask Astor's is a good chain, a good variety of selections and a changing menu keeps it interesting."}
{"text":"Food is great.  Friendliest bunch of servers and bartenders I've encountered anywhere.

I especially like the chicken radiatore.  Always fresh and hot.  I miss the giant meatball which was removed from the menu some time ago."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar waiting to get served watching the two bartenders on their phone laughing.  We eventually got noticed and a loud discussion between my friend and I is what it took to get noticed. Cold service but the wings and beer quite good. Room is very loud and garage like. A typical Jacks."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for drinks. Food took about 30 minutes. Bad service.  Went to milestone instead."}
{"text":"Price: 3/5. Overpriced. 

Atmosphere: 3/5. Pretty busy for a Saturday night but that's expected. Crowded seating if not in a booth.

Service: 3/5. We got our apps and food pretty fast for a table of 10 people. Took awhile to pay for our bills.

What we ordered: 3/5. We got chicken dippers which comes with 3 different sauces and shakers ($10) and steak fajitas comes with sour cream, salsa,  cheese,  lettuce and 4 wraps ($20) which I felt is expensive and not filling."}
{"text":"They've done some renovations and the place looks great. The music is super loud and the place gets busy  so it's hard to hold a conversation.The menu is much smaller and more pricier than Boston Pizza. Nonetheless, a great atmosphere where anyone can come (why the crying babies though?)."}
{"text":"Went here to grab dinner and the service was good and the food was even better. I got the steak frites and my friend got a burger with poutine. (Not sure which burger) 
The environment is quite nice however the music was quite loud, I would have liked it better if it was more in the background so I could hear what the person in front of me was saying."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a first time quick lunch before saying goodbye to my sister and dropping her off at the airport. We were on a time crunch and our server worked with that. Our server Danika was very helpful in suggesting quick things on the menu (which were delicious- thumbs up) she was great as well as the service! 

I have never been to a restaurant where i saw so many friendly faces, with all different people dropping off our food. Will be back again great experience"}
{"text":"Who makes reservations for valentines day at Jack Astors?

My family came here for dinner at 4:45 pm on a Monday. The restaurant and bar were more or less empty, as you may imagine. Except it was valentines day. Why were we there? We were having a family dinner before heading to a funeral home...

After telling the hostess we didn't have a reservation, she essentially scoffed at us. She stared into the completely empty dining room and told us they couldn't fit us in because of all the reservations they had. Fair enough, honour your reservations. But given the time of day, and how empty the restaurant was,  it seemed pretty ridiculous. We were told we could eat in the bar, if we liked.

Looking back, we probably should have walked across the parking lot to Milestones. Our server was disengaged and unimpressive. Brought the food and never really checked in.  Coffee was burnt. When I asked for a dessert and coffee menu, she looked at me like I had two heads. Brought the bill (for over $150.00) and disappeared for 25 minutes. Had to flag down another server to pay the tab.

Overall pretty unimpressive."}
{"text":"I hate, hate, hate, this location. Literally the staff was so rude and at one point I couldn't handle not writing a review of this restaurant. I have been to a few Jack Astors (404 location, Scarborough town center, yonge & dundas) and I have never been served by such untrained employees in my life. 

We had a group of about 7-8 people that night and had reserved seats for quite some time although the we did have to wait 15-20 mins the restaurant was super busy so I could see that it was the shortest wait time. 

We were seated around a circle table that literally was enough to fit 5 people yet we had to squeeze a few more. We started to order water for the entire table and the waitress (who only came and dropped off the water) ended up spilling an entire cup of water over my friends phone and gave us such rude looks like it wasnt her fault. As we got passed that and the serving of the appetizers. Our entrees arrive.. I don't think I have ever been so mad about customer service in my life as I have worked in customer service myself. This gentleman decides to hand me my plate of pasta when he had room to walk over and place it in front of me. Then he has the audacity to hand everyone's dishes to them. I couldn't help myself at this point and had to blurt out. \"what the hell am I doing? serving myself?\" and of course this waiter does not fix anything. I was almost to my tipping point at this moment and was so close into calling every manager on the floor so I could teach their entire staff a lesson on proper customer service. 

We left after this dinner and will never return to this location. it was the most annoying and horrible service i have ever received in my life. I will never recommend this place to anyone I know and would tell them to eat McDonalds rather than go here."}
{"text":"Very unorganized. The hostess doesn't know how to do her job. She gave our table to another group that arrived after us and told us now we have to wait over 20 min for another table to become available. We left. There are lots of restaurants in this area, avoid this Jack Astor's for your own peace of mind."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with a Jack Astor's. I stopped in on my way to classes last week. I sat at the bar and had an awesome chicken club sandwich. I definitely like the vibe of the place. The bartender was friendly and fun. And not to mention they played some awesome music while I was there. Helped put me in a good mood. 
I know this isn't a long review but bottom line: the food is really good, the atmosphere is cool, and the people working there were super friendly. Will I return, most definitely. I can't get that sandwich out of my head. Haha"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar upstairs as I was in town on business.
Plenty of tvs showing NFL games.
Bartender Chris was great. He was personable and attentive in a busy environment.
I ordered a 10oz sirloin and veggies. I was stunned...it was awesome. I generally don't relate Jack Astors to great steak. This steak was better than anything I have eaten at the keg.
Bottom line, very good meal, great service and NFL all over the place.
I will be back and the menu is extensive from standard bar fare to steak and seafood.
Thanks to Chris and the busboy whose name I didn't get but is a Giants fan unfortunately. Both employees were great."}
{"text":"First time here on a snow slush sub-zero temp Monday night. Lightly busy. Service was great. Decor upbeat and clean. Matt set me up with great recommendations of food and drink. All wait staff were full of smiles. The side salad was well presented, great tasting, and larger than expected. I had a southwest burger with tortilla chips guacamole sauce, and really crisp sweet potato fries. I gotta ding them on a really sad looking burger bun but the taste was good. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and classy location. Tried their sparkling lemonade and chicken fingers....must say really tender meat. Went at the last moment so couldn't order enough, but surely going back to try more varieties on their menu."}
{"text":"A group of us went to jack Astors tonight for birthday. The server we had was Sarah H and she was awesome! Super friendly and on top of drink refills and extra forks and we only has reservations for 12 and more of us showed up and she got us extra seating and always took great care of our table. Great service!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food but service is TERRIBLE. Our server never checked up on us and whenever we looked around for her, she was nowhere to he found. And when we did see her, she was socializing with other servers and paid no attention. This was all during lunch time so the place was not busy! I'm not coming back!"}
{"text":"We went here with our kids expecting the same experience we have had in the years of going to Jack Astor's.  The fajita's we ordered had a very sparing portion of chicken and steak. They do not serve beans, rice or guacamole only cheese and lettuce.  They put in just enough salsa and sour cream to cover the bottom of their tiny condiments dish all for $23.00 plus tax! Oh by the way, extra fajitas are an extra charge and if you want rice, beans or guacamole, it all comes for an extra charge!! What a smashing deal! The Asiago pasta was carefully laid out to fill the bottom of the bowl and again over priced for the serving at $20.  The server #4901 did not care about our disappointment as he billed us for the tortilla's.  He stood there above us expecting a tip once we received the bill.  If this is the new Jack Astor's experience, I would recommend to anyone to pass this place and go to where value for a customer and where they spend their money matters."}
{"text":"No espresso machine. The food is fine, and the service is good, but only drip coffee in this day

{"text":"Recommended 3.5 Stars

Pros: roomy place, decent decor, clean
Cons: some menu items should be updated or dropped 

I went here during the day for a late lunch. The restaurant was only about 20% full. 

My server was quite nice, and she came by regularly to check on me. I had the bacon cheeseburger with french fries. The burger came with shredded cheddar cheese on it which was not melted and there was a pile of it. I scraped off the excess cheese and ate the burger which was hot, and that's something I check for in hamburgers. No one wants  to get e-Coli!! The burgers on the menu weren't blowing my mind for originality, but it is a chain restaurant. 

Price-wise it's average. So expect to pay around $15 each person plus tip and taxes. 

The best way to describe this place is what the other reviewer said, it's \"Ho-hum\". 

Nothing wrong with that, as long as it stays consistently a solid 3.5 stars. I will likely go back but I'm not going to be a regular. 

Advice for the owners: maybe just update the menu a bit or check every plate going out and try to make the best presentation you can with what you have to work with if the menu is set by the corporation."}
{"text":"I am giving a 5 star review based on food only! The service was overall pretty bad. The chicken fingers, the French fries with cheese and gravy were amazing and the chicken Thai bowl was the best. Everything came out hot and fresh with a lot of great flavors."}
{"text":"I ordered the classic burger. It was so small I was seriously disappointed! When I compare its size to what you would get at Hero burger it is a lot smaller and they charge more. This is the last time I will order a burger here!"}
{"text":"Bad- 
The waiter forgot our order and brought the appetizer after we finished eating the food. 
We waited half an hour for the food to arrive and the BBQ chicken that we ordered was not fully cooked. 
No refill for the water.

Good-
Seasonal /market vegetables and salad was well prepared. 
Clean place and friendly staff/waiters.

Overall service: Okay"}
{"text":"Average food, overpriced and waited ages for each drink refill. They could have sold me eight beer in the time it took to serve two."}
{"text":"Jackastors is usually the place to go for random group dinners. This location is always busy, twice I had to wait and once I just ended up leaving. Anyways there food is worth it though, I always order the classic poutine with tossed up chicken fingers. I probably go to Jacks to have that once a month at least. The nachos are typical, nothing special. The crab dip, quesadilla, chicken poppers (I believe that's what they're called) are all good but don't recommend any of the pasta's.

I never had a complaint the countless times I've ate here. The food and customer service is consistent. Oh forgot the brownie, its one of the best."}
{"text":"Great wings, fajitas, chicken fingers and specials. Reasonably priced with great wait staff, a little noisy."}
{"text":"Good drink, nice patio and great bartenders. I've been there couple of time and would go back again."}
{"text":"The staff & food are fabulous here! They make the best red sangria (with extra fruit) & offer a variety of items on the menu. We recently were there with a larger group of ladies (girls Night) and they even had a magician who went table to table performing various tricks. I personally visit regularly with my best friend as it's our \"go to\" spot to debrief on each other's lives & were from Alliston so that's saying something if we're willing to drive to Jacks that's 40 Min Away. Honesty, Ive never had a bad experience here! Highly recommend 10+"}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times because it's near my home and I don't know why I keep going back. Even if it's not busy the service is bad and food isn't always great."}
{"text":"As far as sports bars go, this one is pretty good.

Me and my father went on a very busy Saturday evening and were still served with a smile and got the food at a good time. And the food was great!

I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone"}
{"text":"For those of you who live in California, this is the Canadian version of TGI Fridays or BJ's Restaurant.  And just like those two places, most of the dishes here are fried, full of fat, or a combination of the two.  That in itself doesn't make it a bad place but it would have been nice to have more options.

The service was good and it seems to me they make an effort to hire very beautiful girls to work there.  That kind of makes it like a higher end Hooters (instead of really tight tops, girls wear really short skirts).  

We had a sandwich with a soup along with a chicken breast salad.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either.  Obviously, the food here is not the main attraction.

If you want to have a beer, hang out with your buddies, be aloud and watch the football (or should I say hockey) game, this is the right place for you.  If you are visiting Toronto as a tourist, there are some other options downtown that will give you more of the local flavor and cuisine."}
{"text":"I always choose Jack Astors when my friends and I want to hang out somewhere late. I love this location! The staff are always friendly, even at super busy times! This location is the best I've been to in terms of food and service."}
{"text":"Peppercorn pasta dish was removed from the now 1 page menu. Food was not very good. Chicken parmesean was cold and tasted like Salsa on it. Server argued with me when I asked about the old pasta dish. I Used to come here as often as I could when I worked around here. Won't ever come back. Place is a concert hall for wanna be sportsmen and armchair quarterbacks. No garlic panbread with my entree either.  I was still hungry.  WHAT A JOKE!!

$3.29 for a diet coke? Are you friggin serious??"}
{"text":"Screwed one order twice. Been here a year or so ago with bad experience though give another chance but was a mistake. Won't come back to this location"}
{"text":"Returned to this iconic location for the first time in years. The view of Dundas Square is stunning, the large battalion of service staff are competent and friendly, the food prices are high and the food itself is uninspiring. 

I had the fish and chips. Nothing was particularly wrong with it, but if a normal \"fish n chips\" restaurant was committed to serving this dish, it would be out of business within 6 months.

The most common accusation towards Astor's is that they cook their food from previously frozen boxed food, and this meal did nothing to convince me otherwise.

The customers here ought to be made up entirely of tourists (nice view and they don't know anywhere better to eat), suburbanites (Astor's loves suburban strip malls) and suckers (like me, sadly willing to meet friends at a \"you can't miss it\" location)."}
{"text":"The Elvis Krispy Kreme Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse with Bacon and Banana DONUT is to die for! But it was a test run item for the Waterdown location and now it's gone! Bummer! However they still have the best burgers in town, seasonal fish (perch), and specialty items that don't stick around for long , so get them while you can!"}
{"text":"Really liked coming here! It was my first time and the food was amazing! The service was good and the atmosphere was great. It's definitely on the loud side and very casual. I had the chicken poutine and it was to die for. My boyfriend has the sirloin burger with pulled pork on it (big Texas burger I think?) and it was amazing. I had to have a second giant bite of it. Come here with friends for drinks for sure."}
{"text":"Your paying for portions that have been reduced with prices that increased. Also their food isn't quality at all anymore service was ok, it's just not a fun atmosphere either. I think I'm a never again customer to this place. Horrible overall vibe."}
{"text":"Stars were based on entrance  and service. However food wise, a disaster of food. My partner and I ordered Pasta, Garlic Herb shrimp Pasta, and other asiago chicken bow ties, after two attempts of having it sent back, it was cold. And basically just brought as food person who was jokingly making the meal. I did not finish my pasta, nor Would you, if you were in my position. I'm completely unsatisfied when food is brought in such manner. 
It's almost saying why did you even come? And to make matters worse it's st patty's day so service and food should have some attention brought to them! After I didn't eat had it pushed to the front of table, I had manager show up, -Aleeza, she took care of the bill and brought another meal for me, but she was open to my suggestion to  fix your Friday evening chefs. I'm a foodie, hope to visit again but we shall see."}
{"text":"I technically want to give this 3.5 stars, the 0.5 because of the location.  This is the one that sits atop Yonge/Dundas square, which makes for interesting people-watching from far away if you like sitting at the patio during summer days or even chillier autumn nights, as the patio is heated.

On my most recent visit, we opted to sit inside within the bar area.  It was a packed Friday night but the wait for a table was under 10 minutes. Our waitress was friendly but she was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of customers so the service was rather slow.  

Since it's Jack Astors, I usually don't venture out into 'fancy' sections, since I stick to bar foods that can't go wrong no matter who is preparing it.  So I ordered the beer battered fish and chips with fries, while my bf ordered the pizza (it's the one with a lot of bbq sauce and chicken), and we got the lobster dip appetizer to start.  

The appetizer was by far my favourite!  I am usually tempted by the spinach and artichoke dip but trying the lobster dip on a whim was a good decision.  The dip was rich and creamy, with lobster meat chunks in it.  They also gave us a good ratio of dip to pita bread/nacho chips so we didn't have the issue of finishing one before the other.  As for my main, I had nothing really to say about it...except the fries were extremely bland.  I usually love fries but these fries sat there untouched.  The pizza was meh, not worth the premium pricing over regular pizza you can buy but tasty enough to fill you.

Ambience was lively, Friday night here really felt like TGIF.  They were blasting the top 40 hits, and the customers (mostly young university students/professionals who just got off work) chattered away happily in the loud music.

Overall, this particular Jack Astors is good for its ambience and location.  I would go back just for drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Wow, has this restaurant gone down hill. I remember Jack Aster's being half-way decent (not fantastic, but decent). To say it's mediocre is a giant compliment that I won't be issuing. It was horrible tonight. The food quality is way down, the cheap fillers are up, and the service is awful. So many servers, so little attention. How does that even happen? Not impressed. Sorry Jack-we're done. We will never return. $60 for crap."}

Extra information:

* Couple locations within Toronto
* Serves alcohol
* Lunch menu Avail
* Kids menu Avail
* Located on top floor at Dundas Square

I had to visit Jack Astors at least once. There is no Jack Astors or Pickle Barrel on the Westcoast so I felt obligated, especially since my horrible dining experience at Pickle Barrel- I wanted to see how horrible Jack Astor could be (yes, I am weird like that).

I received one of those 'Spend $30 and get $10 off your meal' cards from Jack Astors so I decided I would drop by and finally check them out. They are conveniently located at Dundas Square, but kind of hidden away on the very top floor where AMC theatre is at. The restaurant is spacious with high ceiling with couple TVs in the bar area.

The tables were covered in brown paper so people could scribble on them while waiting for food.  When our waitress, Nickie came along, she wrote her name on the table which I thought was different and cute.

Ordered: Jack's Golden Calamari 3.5/5

* Marinated calamari breaded to order, served with roasted garlic lemon aioli and spicy cocktail sauce for $10.87
* Calamari was big in portion
* It was very crispy and well done, but couldn't really taste the marinade on the calamari
* Calamari itself was good but I didn't really enjoy the sauce they served it with
* Roasted garlic lemon aioli was too heavy for the deep fried calamari pieces
* If served with a different sauce, this would be a good appetizer to share

Ordered: Lunch Size Steak Fajitas 4/5

* Sizzling vegetables served with cheddar cheese, sour cream, salsa and warm flour tortillas for $11.87
* Quality of the steak was pretty decent and they came in large pieces
* roasted peppers and onions went well with the steak wrapped up in tortilla 
* cheddar cheese was grated fresh 
* Good lunch portion for it's price

Ordered: Lunch Size Parmesan Chicken Parmigiana 3.5/5

* Fresh chicken breast lightly breaded and topped with smoked Mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce served with bowtie pasta for $12.98
* Pasta was cooked very well and it was coated with creamy cheese sauce which wasn't too heavy
* Big portion for lunch 
* I was 1/3 done with this dish when I found the chicken to be cold inside
* I called the waitress over and explained to her how it was cold- then she apologized and offered to bring me a new one
* I really appreciated her effort but I had to wait extra 30 minutes to get a new one
* But then she came over again and apologized how it took so long and took it off my bill
* I would have enjoyed this dish a lot if none of this happened

Summary: Overall, Jack Astor seems like a decent franchise restaurant (much better than Pickle Barrel in terms of food). It was nice how the management dealt with the issue I had with the food and as I was dining, I was tweeting and they actually responded back throughout the meal. Because they took off my pasta off the bill, I decided I wouldn't use the $10 off coupon. I might go back if I receive one of those coupons in the mail again, but if I am looking for generic American/Canadian food, I much rather head over to Joeys."}
{"text":"Ok - for the food at Jack Astors is good but it is not 4 stars by my rating scale!  What gets this location to 4 stars overall is the roof top patio!

Today I took two of my men tees for lunch and we grabbed a beer under the sun! Being 4 or 5 stories above Yonge street was great and this patio is huge! I have been here a few times in the past year and on a Thursday or Friday late afternoon or evening, this patio is a great stop if you are in the north end of the city before you head back downtown for the evening!"}
{"text":"The hotel recommended a Jack Astor's and well it sounded fun but when we got there it was an Interesting mix of TGIF and other similar restaurants.

The drinks were \"OK\" and the food was average.  This is a good place for after work or going away work event or something like that.  Maybe to meet a new/old friend if you don't mind the loud noise.  The waiter spent a lot of time upselling and looking around at other tables while taking our order.  

Food.  overall the food was average to good.  I tried a pasta/salmon/peppercorn dish and it was above average.

For kids: you can color on the tables and the kids menu was pretty good. IMO,  choose this place for an improved TGIF like experience."}
{"text":"This place is usually very crowded and it takes a while before you are seated. 

I usually end up taking Salmon or Fajitas and both taste good. The waitresses are pleasant and the food waiting time is not much. 

I don't go here that often though because I kinda find this place to be bit too noisy."}
{"text":"Been here a few times as it is very close to work and enjoy a nice lunch with coworkers or friends when they are in the area. It is what you can expect from a chain eatery - food has always been good and never disappointed. Service is excellent and rarely had any complaints. Prices are a tad on the higher side, but nothing out of the ordinary for this type of restaurant.

Not 5 stars simply because it offers nothing out of the ordinary - but a solid choice downtown. Can get really packed, especially around Raptors/Leafs/Jays games and lunch in general."}
{"text":"Take this review with a grain of salt as I did come with a big group. 

Being a large chain restaurant and having been to other locations, I had expectations going in regarding the food quality. For the most part it has met my expectations. I had the fish and chips and while not amazing, it wasn't horrible either. I am disappointed that they chose to put the fish on top of the fries as it ended up making the fries soggy and the bottom of the fish soggy. 

Service was a little slow but very accommodating. I can see this being the case because of our large group. 

They do have a nice patio! Great for the summer. But aside from the patio and their ability to seat a large group on short notice, I don't think this would be on my list of go tos."}
{"text":"Ask for Mark he is the best. Meagan the manager welcomed us as it was our first time being there. They made us feel like part of the family"}

2 min later the natchoes came the toping where light not sure if that was the way it should be .
3 min later the steaks came out .
With very little room on the table we had it all together . 
Come on Jack space the food out  .
Good thing I didn't order ice cream or that would of come out also .
They treat you like dairy cream you get all your food at once .
BAD DID NOT GET VALUE FOR MY MONEY ."}
{"text":"Awesome food and atmosphere. he service is excellent, prompt and courteous. The poutine and chicken finger are terrific and this is far better than any Boston Pizza that I have set foot into, Jack Astor's is a pleasant place to hang out with friends, while providing good food and a good selection of beer. Jack Astor's is a very good restaurant with a wide variety of times to chose from, and it's a pleasant place to be."}
{"text":"*WARNING* Scammer waitress! - I'll get into the actual food review in a minute but felt I had to address this in the beginning. I'm also really not one to complain about service since I like to give people the benefit of a doubt or cut them some slack but this waitress was just shady af. 

Just got back from a night out with a group of friends and a waitress by the name of Vikki K. approached our table. Her attitude right away rubbed me the wrong way as she had asked in a rather irritable tone \"Are you guys going to dine in or have drinks or order sporadically?\". So we had told her probably the latter as we were expecting more people. Then she said after sighing \"OK... Good to know.\" First of all, if you're not mentally prepared to wait on two tables for a group, then either trade with someone or ask for help, but don't give your customers that type of attitude. Or maybe even DON'T BE A WAITRESS! We are a group of friends in the hospitality field for a luxury hotel chain so we know what and how customer service should be. 

Anyway, the night went on and people came in at various times. Kitchen staff were great and the food came pretty quick. I had the Hold the Beef burger which is a vegetarian burger and the quality at this location wasn't as good as when I had it at Scarborough Town Centre location. Still I enjoyed it a bit so I'd give that a 3/5.

Now comes the bill. Although we were considered a large group, not everyone ate and also everyone had individual bills. How the bill was to be divided up, was never discussed with Vikki K, but it is pretty common that bills are split individually, so they were. Here's the shady part: she added service charge to every single bill. This was only noticed later on when we had already paid our bills. Before the realization, though, I did notice that she was hovering over my shoulder when I was paying my bills on the debit machine. As soon as they were paid, she dipped pretty quickly and pretty much disappeared after. 

It's just such a shame that someone would go to such level in order to \"make a living\". If her service and attitude were outstanding from the beginning, then I have no problem giving a bigger tip. But she basically robbed our entire group. The only time she was really being extremely nice was when she was pretty much eyeing my friend's man. He pretty much got the best service. 

If you do go here with a group, be sure to check your bills twice and have someone else serve you.

Update: I had spoken with the Bar Manager the following day and he was most apologetic.  He listened intently and to extend his apologies, he had sent some vouchers right away.  Receiving vouchers was never my intention however he insisted that he send some.  I personally feel that the original review written above should remain posted just so costumers are completely aware of this.  It has been a few weeks so who knows if the waitress is still around."}
{"text":"Thats my place where I want to live and die.  
Awesome place to enjoy and have a lot of fun with friends."}
{"text":"Basic American food, great music, and nice waitress. Nothing special about the menu. It was a nice place to eat with a nice crowd and loud music. The bar had great drinks and good customer service. They forgot a few things I requested, but everything else was good. It is also next to the cinema, which made it easy to find the next entertainment after a decent dinner."}
{"text":"Mary J. Blige, Blue Cantrell, Kylie Minogue, where am I? 

I'm at Jack Astors for a friend's birthday. The music is bad AND loud. They squished 6 of us in a booth. My 6\"4 friend cannot enjoy his fajitas because he's scared of elbowing everyone in the face as he assembles. 

I ordered the \"Mango Pachango\" to drink. Sadly, it didn't measure up to the fun name. Just too much ice, no presentation whatsoever (cocktail in a water glass, where's the pachango in that?) and I could not taste that I had \"jacked it up\" with an extra shot for half the price. 

The Cajun salmon was cooked nicely, but again there was no presentation. Just salmon on one side, (undercooked) veggies, and white rice. The description in the menu was so vivid, so tasty! But that's all folks, that's what was on my plate. Oh, and a \"decorative\" plastic spear that was standing straight up in my salmon for no reason. 

Gotta say, despite it all, the waiter was great. Everything came out quickly and in good time. We only mentioned once in passing that it was the friend's birthday and at the perfect moment caramel covered brownies came flying out right in front of her, with two sparklers! 

I think I'll get my late 90s music fix elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks one night. The drinks were pretty good and the prices were great! Haven't tried the food, but I'm sure its's like a typical Jack Astor's. I like the specialty cocktails, but I wish they had a bit more options."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Jack Astors we have ever been too.

When we arrived, we were advised that there was a 45min wait for a table for 2. Ok.

After we were seated,I had to ask/remind the waitress over 3 times about the water we asked for. In fact, the water took so long that we got out appetizer before the water.
All of the waitresses were running around as it was busy, so I can see that it is not their fault, but the restaurant should ensure that they are properly staffed.

 I got a smoked salmon dish, and my bf got a chicken bowtie dish.
The food arrived pretty fast but both of the dishes arrived BARELY WARM at our table. My bf's chicken bowties were UNCOOKED, the chicken BURNED.
I am not sure how a dish so horrible was allowed to leave the kitchen.
We requested to have it remade, because of the bad pasta. The second time around the pasta arrived, the chicken was still burned.

The women's washrooms were FILTHY. There was no toilet paper IN ANY OF THE STALLS  and no paper towels. It looked like it had not been cleaned the whole day.

We will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday with a group of friends. There are 3 people in the front to seat you but one server serving many tables. Service was terrible we couldn't get someone to serve us. I had to chase someone for an extra glass. When server took too long I went to the bar to get drinks myself the bartender with a rude response said \"get your server to serve you.\" Will not be going back again."}
{"text":"I'm in Toronto for a conference and I'm a huge Cowboys fan. Unbeknownst to me the game was on a weather delay. But Emma, the manager, spent 40 minutes helping me figure that out and made sure one if the screens had the game on once it resumed. They are awesome and the food was good to boot!"}
{"text":"We went to Jack Astor's on a Friday afternoon near 4:00 right before Happy Hour. Either way we were hungry and wanted drinks and appetizers before a huge meal. We'd only been driving allllll day. We got three appetizers (chicken bites, fries & guac dip) plus two mixed drinks. Our bill was $79.00... WHAT!  The food was ok but we were not expecting the cost of the bill. It was to be a quick stop.  Its very similar to Applebee's & TGIFriday's but I think the food at Jack Astors is better.
The bill deterred us from returning during the trip. We'd give it another shot on another visit.
Overall the service was fast and the atmosphere was jumping especially for early afternoon. I'd like to see whats it's like during a sporting event or late evening. The location is in a prime location and easy to get to."}
{"text":"High school cafeteria food quality to match the abundant number of waitresses dressed in school girl kilts.  My hamburger was tasteless.  Likeaphenomena liked her Asian Chicken Salad and the Little K managed to slurp down half her beer and cheddar soup.  

Entertainment was provided by the antics in the kitchen.  My chair pointed directly into the path of the kitchen entrance  and before long I was transfixed by my own personal viewing of Kitchen Confidential. The chef was fortified by a can of Red Bull and an assistant helped himself to fries waiting for pick-up.  Perhaps that's why half my portion cup of fries was empty?  And who knew that you could wipe out a dirty plate with a serviette and use it again?  Sorry, but no.  The Little K, who has official kitchen restaurant experience, told me that I should relax and enjoy the exposure to extra germs.  A bonus: the night's experience might help me develop new antibodies for the next super-bug to come along."}
{"text":"$10 for pint of Guinness is really not a good deal. First of all, because Guinness is all the same in any place with avr. price = $5.5. For me this case is a perfect indicator of poor management. I am pretty sure, they buy the cheapest products and cook with not-quality ingredients, just to make more pennies. For me, the great bar is that builds the great relationship with customers. So Jack Astors has the worst attitude to its customers in whole Toronto ! 

Friend of mine invited me to this bar again. The food tested like a garbage. it was so lower quality, that i am not able to eat this shit. Budweiser was diluted and service was absolutely unreleased.  Poor Canadians!"}
{"text":"Never been to this chain.  Food was great (rice bowl, soup and a burger between the two of us).  Well priced.  Waiter was VERY good.  Easy to access, roomy, not loud, great atmosphere.  Would certainly return."}
{"text":"I like jacks. It's that friends place everyone loves to hang out at. It makes the \"where should we go\" feel easy to deal with. Be it with your gf/bf, homies, padres, gangster mafioso partner meeting the new guy, business merger meeting, firing your partner dinner, divorce \"drinks\", contract killer interview.. whatever. Jack Astor's has definitely made a name for itself. One love for all.

This location seems like a hit or miss in respect to service. Conveniently on John st, in a people traffic busy road, you either have a good experience or myeh. (i don't think you can have a bad experience at Jacks. Unless you fall under the Divorce drinks category. )

 I believe the world needs Jacks. Why? - glad you asked. 
You see, once you walk in.. you can never really tell who can afford more than who. Money is not a question here. Everyone sings the same tune - come as you are. Literally. Nobody dresses up, prices are pretty cheap so you can buy your friends bday beer without sweating, stalk your gf/bf and have an lb of wings while you 'wait'. To make it better, the menu always has sharing apps that makes for excellent food bonding experience. 

If you need a reason to visit any Jack Astor's,  you aren't wired right. 

wings 1lb 
2 beers + pitcher
= no more than $30.

keep up the revolution alive!

{"text":"Football Sunday and guess who got a $100 Tab compliments of Jack Astors. 
Yip, your girl SURE DID :)

Next time you are at Jacks , put your name in the VVVIP draw. 

Once your name gets drawn, they send an email out to you with a reservation time for Sunday. There's a winner EVERY week - as in you have a good chance of winning if you put your name in. The email confirms the name the table will be arranged for and they give you a specific time you have to make for. You cannot reschedule or move the date. You are able to bring up to 3 friends :) 


First rounds of drinks were on Jacks so you know I had to Pint it up right? 
The waitress was really sweet with explaining how the VIP tab works. It's pretty much $100 on any food on the menu  and only the first round of alcoholic drinks are covered with the deal. 

Wings 2 pds
honey garlic and medium

calamari

Kafta plate
humus with shreds of lettuce and 4 skewers of lamb kafta. spicy
comes with a side of flatbreads

chkn quesedillas - my favourite

smoked mtl meat poutine 
pickes 
mustard
gravy
smoked beef meat

Bowtie pasta w chkn (to go) - free evening dinner - Noiceee. 
  

earl grey tea (starbucks cups with tazo fancy brand tea)
which was just super rich. 

cookie desert
with vanilla icea cream - 1 scoop
and 2 scoops of reese's peanut butter scoops. Drizzled with chocolate sauce on top of whip cream and a piece of strawberry.

the chocolate brownie sundae was a small version of all the mixtures mentioned above minus the cookie. 


The bill came up to $126.57 and the manager told us not to worry about the bit extra. So we ended up just paying for tip.

I've said this before, there's a reason why this franchise does so well in it's category. It is the go to choice of restaurant for anyone and everyone's dinner/lunch/breakfast(if it was socially accepted). 

Random wise quote: Love at first sight means you'll never stop looking. When it comes to Jacks - Why keep looking if you've already found the one? 

my \"i told you so\" moment : It pays to read my reviews. Pays you $100 to spend at Jacks!!.  


xoxo - sharing foodie love, one bite at a time.

{"text":"Came here over a dozen times and never wrote a review in the past.. However my last visit prompted me to do so, Came with a group from work service was excellent and appetizers were prepared very well! The servers are really good always made sure everything was good on our end"}
{"text":"The food at Jack Astor's is normally good as it is a restaurant chain. I salivate over the nachos, quesadillas, and of course their garlic pan bread.  But I was disappointed when I had the chicken fingers and fries.  The best was the fries, they had the perfect crispness and cooked perfectly. 

However the chicken fingers were lacking.  I had the breaded version with panko crumbs instead of sauced.   I found the chicken to be quite bland and ended up saturating each morsel with the dipping sauce that comes with the order.  Obviously if I had them with sauce that would add flavour to the chicken, but you'd think they would have a special seasoned breaded type also.  Again, this wouldn't stop me from going to JA's I'll just opt for the nachos over the chicken fingers!"}
{"text":"First off, the food is not good. I've been here twice and we also ordered a bunch of different meals and not one single one was good both times. The service is also very slow. I heard the patio was nice but I've never been; other than that I don't know why anybody would come here to eat. I would not recommend any Jack Astor's and I will never come again."}
{"text":"The food was ok...pretty much what you would expect from a chain restaurant like this.   The service was PAINFULLY slow - had to ask for everything twice (including the bill which took about 20 minutes to come).  Pretty poor in any environment, but especially bad since the restaurant was only 25% full."}
{"text":"Overpriced! Jack Astors isn't what it used to be. Service was non-existent. The steak is a joke for $22.00. Chicken fingers ($15) did not taste \"fresh and made in house\", as advertised. 100% were frozen chicken fingers. Fries were cold and soggy. 

The chicken sandwich was 75% bread 25%chicken. 

Lastly the \"lobster spinach cheese dip\" was just cheese dip with tons of mushrooms and zero lobster to be found! 

Beer was ridiculous. Pitcher of Rolling Rock for 23.00$?!?!?! I understand if we were downtown Toronto, but we were in Etobicoke across from Sherway. 

Will not return! Too bad Joeys Sherway was packed."}
{"text":"Yep it's a chain but good quality and always consistent.   Garlic bread with cheese and the sauced up chicken fingers are staples for a reason.  Try the lemon concoction too."}
{"text":"Is this Canada or the United States? After the appetizers they had \"entrees\", certainly they mean main courses, since entree in the Queen's English means appetizer. The food was good, the service was fine. Waiter almost lost his hand taking away my plate while other people were still eating at the table. (Again, this is Canada, you clear the table when everyone is done, not while others are still eating.)"}
{"text":"Jack Astors does actually care about their quality and their customers! I appreciate that and will be returning."}
{"text":"The plates here are awesome. My favourite plate is the buffalo salad which is the size of your head and is packed with cheese, buffalo fingers and ranch sauce. The food isn't healthy but it is definitely filling and delicious. One caveat for this location is that it's always very busy. Make sure to make a reservation when you go!"}
{"text":"Great View. Food is OK. Nice place to enjoy with a couple friends."}
{"text":"Oh so yummy I like the environment here and staff was super friendly they have lots of options but can be pricy it's a nice place for date night or simple girls night out! I love how you can draw on the table makes it that much more fun waiting for food!"}
{"text":"Cozy and friendly Service, good for dinners with excellent food at affordable prices.The best kept secret  down town.
I have never heard a complaint by anyone  that is reasonably person ,who dines frequently. It is not Swiss Chalet  with separate checks crowd. Trust me  it a good to dine !"}
{"text":"The food has gone down hill here terribly, it's soo salty and the poorest quality i miss the old jacks menu"}
{"text":"As the weather starts warming up, the patio opens! Woohoo! But, do you really want to sit on Jack's patio? 

Both times me and my coworkers sat on the patio, we were neglected and although our servers were fully aware we are on a one hour lunch break, our food took more than an hour to arrive. 

Every time the server went back inside, we knew she wasn't coming back out for another 20 minutes. Even when we asked for the bill, it took forever. On one occasion the manager was apologetic and comped us for our food, but our second patio experience was the same way.

While I don't recommend Jack Astor's patio, the service indoors has never been an issue.  Which would you choose: More sun or More service?"}
{"text":"We walked into this restaurant with just over an hour to spare, as we were going to the cinema afterwards and hadn't eaten any dinner yet.. The service was great and food was served in record time! The only reason I gave a 4/5 stars was because my sauce in my dish was spicy and it probably wouldn't be noticed by some, but I hate spicy food so I didn't enjoy the dish as much as I'd have liked, and plus there was no spice in the description on the menu so.. Otherwise no complaints, staff were lovely, food was great and we got dinner and our movie without throwing the food down our necks!
Great atmosphere 
Tv screens everywhere so great if you want to watch a game?
Quirky touches like bottles fitted to light fixtures
Free wifi
Free drink top up"}
{"text":"Cool, chill place for a late night hangout.  Gr8 music, lots of early 2000s hip hop playing amidst the chatter that buzzing from table to table. Friendly staff ready to strike-up conversation about the difference between Canada and the States. Can't beat the view overlooking Dundas Square, which is the heart of all downtown activity - 24/7. Went twice this week, and will go again when we return to Toronto. 7/1/15"}
{"text":"Sat on the patio on a super hot Sunday afternoon. Maybe half capacity. Multiple servers and staff around, but 20 minutes and no one bothers to take our initial drink orders or anything else. Table next to us having the same poor experience. Finally flag down a random server. Place our drink orders and a 2 foot nacho board. Literally about 8 chips spaced inches apart from each other on a board, with very little toppings and covered in shredded lettuce. Not enough to qualify as an appetizer for one, and it was $15. Our guest ordered pad thai with shrimp, took them at least 20 minutes to come back and inform us they are out of shrimp. I started this review 15 minutes after requesting our bill, and it still hasn't come. Server just arrived and admitted the service today was horrible and apologized. Never again, Jack."}
{"text":"Our waiter Mark was awesome! Very knowledgeable of the menu and very patient and nice. When we were leaving he came up to me and gave me my sunglasses that I forgot, much appreciated. Food was fantastic & the nachos were out of bounds. Keep up the great hospitality!"}
{"text":"Sat at the patio. The mist is bad. Water kept leaking on the table and our drinks, food, and body. Manager changed our Drinks because it was a bit flat. That was awesome. Food was mediocre and they didn't give us any cutlery or napkins. Table was super unstable. The leaking water really made this three star into a two star experience."}
{"text":"A few friends and I went here this past New Year's Eve. The staff was really friendly, and our waitress checked up on us a fair number of times. 

My steak was not cooked according to my request, so they took it back and had it done properly right away. At the end of our meal, the manager approached me and said that desert was on them because of the steak, and I kindly declined because I wasn't hungry. She said that they could just pack desert for me, and have me take it home. This was generous, but I kindly declined once again. She then said that my drink was on them. 

This just goes to show that they're willing to go that extra mile to satisfy the customer. This has been my favorite bar & grill so far, and I'm definitely visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for some beer and finger food.  The prices were a bit too high and the food was just average.  The place has a lot of TVs so it's good for watching a game but otherwise go somewhere else.  I don't see the draw for this place."}
{"text":"I don't understand why reviews here are so low. 

Honestly, Jack Astor's is decent for a chain restaurant. Good drinks (too young for alcohol) include the Oreo Milkshake, which I would not recommend if you do not have a sweet tooth, and the Astro Blaster, a mix of three juices and coconut milk. Food was alright, but not bad enough to merit a two-star rating. Deluxe Bacon Cheeseburger, smoked salmon, and riblets. Average, but better than your average chain restaurant."}
{"text":"So we are in Mississauga and we are hungry.  Looking around for a restaurant on Hurontario Street was probably a bad choice.  Pulled into the Square One Mall area.  The mall is already closed sine it is a holiday.  We find Jack Astor's.

The place is okay.  Food was a little better than okay while the service was a little less than okay.  Waitress asked if I wanted regular fries or sweet potato fries.  She never mentioned the upcharge for the sweet potato fries that appeared on the bill.

I thought the place was a little overpriced, but then I think every restaurant in Canada is overpriced.  If I was nearby, I might give it another go."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and father decided to go for dinner last night and we chose good old Jack Astors. I'm a fan of Jack Astors with the exception of the fact I think the prices are a little high. However, that being said the portions are usually quite decent so you get what you pay for. Our waitress was attentive but not overly, which was nice because we were catching up. My dad ordered the gaucho steak which came with the biggest side of fries I've ever seen in my life. I had a wok bowl which was delicious and that I'll definitely order again! Definitely satisfied my chinese food craving, only a bit better. My guy had the fajitas with the jalapeno sauce that was so strong our neighbors commented on. He said to make sure you have some pepto because he had serious heart burn today haha. I wouldn't say Jack Astors is my first choice but if you're looking for some good food with lots if tvs to get your sports on, then this is the place!"}
{"text":"I'm a very regular customer to this specific Jack Astor's while I do not visit the other locations ones! Why? Because I can never get enough of their amazing rooftop patio overlooking the busy Dundas Square! 

It's so nice that they put the mists during the scorching hot days of summer AND sunscreen on the tables for everybody! So thoughtful! 

The ambiance is always nice and relaxed, hubby and I love going there with friends and family. They're so easy going that the only thing missing is if I could bring my dogs enjoy the patio too!"}
{"text":"I had a great time at Astor Jacks. I met up with an old friend and we were able to chat until 2am without any pressure to hurry up and leave. I went back the next night for dinner again and the waitress kindly gave me some sheets of table paper so I could wrap a package the next day (I was trapped in a hotel on an unexpected layover). Food is delicious, and drinks are good. Truffle fries are a bit \"truffley\" but definitely worth trying. Yum yum."}
{"text":"Nice place to catch up with friends. Good sized burgers - a bit over priced but again the portion is quite large. The atmosphere is nice and relaxed too. 
There are a lot of TV screens - you don't know where to look. And often everyone is watching different things!
The waiter service is the happiest I've ever seen - very attentive and helpful. Drinks were good - a full bar with tons of alcohol on offer. 
This place seems like someplace to have as a regular watering hole or somewhere to watch a good game."}
{"text":"Horrible expensive precooked microwaved food .. this location is my worst JA experience ever .. stick with the beer nothing else"}
{"text":"I like their variety of beers on tap but Good God, they have the most horrible greasy wings I've ever had. You'd think when you batter and fry something you may add some seasoning? Nope, not in this case... just bland grease. Maybe they'll hear about St Louis wings one day."}
{"text":"Great food! 
Friendly staff. 
Plenty of screens. 
Atmosphere was so nice.
Actually I didnt expect about steak quality and taste that much but it was best beef steak ever! (Better than the keg)

Great drinks menu, too.

They also have very nice rooftop patio."}
{"text":"Not much to write about, food is mediocre at best.  Atmosphere was bar style.

Asked the server if they had 'Aged beef steak' she said 'they do not have HP steak, but she can bring the sauce on the side'"}
{"text":"I stopped into Jack Astor's the other night because it was late and the place we were hoping to go to was closed.  I had never heard of it so I didn't know what to expect.  It was a slow weeknight so I was surprised when I walked in to find dance music blasting.  I'm not really sensitive to loud music, but it was annoying to have to shout at my coworkers sitting across from me.  I could see this being acceptable on a packed Friday or Saturday night, but on a weeknight with nobody there it didn't really fit.

The service and the food were both average.  I ordered the really really big meatball which was one half-pound meatball served on a small pile of spaghetti.  It was okay, but relatively boring.  There wasn't too much on the menu that was appealing, it was mostly typical bar food.  The beer selection was decent.

I'm not really sure what Jack Astor's is trying to be.  They look like a sports bar with their large TVs, but have the feel of a club with their loud dance music.  I typically love sports bars but I wasn't a fan of this place.  I would likely only stop in here again if we get out of work late and it's the only place open."}
{"text":"This is my first review and I would have to say this place is not too bad! I was looking for something small and light so I decided on the ahi tuna poke, it was very tasty. A good amount of sauce and whatever kind of seasoning they had on the side to add to the ahi was just right. The wonton crisps were fried nicely and complimented the freshness of the tuna. Also, the atmosphere was fun, we got in just before the rush it seemed, yet the service was still very fast and friendly. There was some island style music playing the entire time as well!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre food with really bad service. At one point they were dusting the rail right next to us while we were eating. The waitress was more interested in talking with her friends than checking on us. At some point it felt almost like she had a personal dislike for us. STAY AWAY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Where to begin with Jack Astors Rathburn...

I wish I had wrote a review 5-6 years ago about this place because of how DIFFERENT it used to be.

So let me just compensate for that in this review...

5-6 years ago - Jack Astors Rathburn was a good restaurant. The food was solid, the wait staff was great, and it was much quieter on weekends. 
The wait staff was so good that they actually remembered us by name and would always know our orders off the top of their head. My friends and I would practically go here almost every weekend and the occasional weekday because of how much we loved the vibe.

Fast forward to Jack Astors TODAY - The restaurant has obviously changed. In my personal opinion, the change was for the worse. 

The vibe that I used to get is now long gone. This place is almost always overcrowded. You usually have to wait 20+ minutes to get a seat. The wait staff (which evidently are all young and good looking - probably to try and get repeat visitors) are still very nice but do not seem to care as much as they did when the place first opened. 
The food is now TERRIBLE. Burgers taste weird, fries are now dumped into a TINY tin can (which looks ridiculous), the nachos are as salty as the Caribbean Ocean, and the food selection looks like its picked at random (makes no sense whatsoever). Jack Astors has truly lost their identity. 
My biggest gripe with this restaurant is the NOISE LEVEL. When you walk into this restaurant, you feel like you've just entered a club. Did I mention that they now have a DJ in the bar section? We have conveniently nicknamed him DJ Jacky Ass. There is absolutely no reason why the music has to be so loud that you cannot even talk to your friends.

Overall, this restaurant has gone downhill. My friends and I no longer go as often as we did for the reasons mentioned above."}
{"text":"I can understand why this Jack Astor's location has a polarizing reception from other users. The quality of the food can be hit-or-miss, the ambience often resembles a loud dining hall, and it feels like the restaurant is the testing bed for a lot of new servers. Despite that, I've been here multiple times and continue to visit.

The last time my friends and I were here, we showed up late in the evening just before a UFC pay-per-view was starting. Although the place was packed, I did manage to finesse my way to getting our group to a large table quickly and easily. The hostesses were very accommodating and pleasant, though I suspect that they get a lot of people who walk in off the street expecting to get a reservation (after all, this location is diagonally adjacent to Union Station) and plan accordingly.

The chicken fingers and fries I had were solid, but nothing to write home about. Conversely, there wasn't much to the nachos our group had, and the response to the burgers everyone else had were mixed.

Where this place really shines is via its bar and ambience when major sporting events are occurring. The place practically shuts down and everybody just sits around watching the televisions. It's during this time that I saw one server loudly drop a platter full of glasses of water and spend a good half-hour trying to clean up the mess. The whole atmosphere of the place changes into this kind of pseudo-Western saloon where everybody's your friend and there's no real rush to go anywhere.

In that respect, this is precisely the reason why I enjoyed the experience, even if the food was middling at best. Regardless, I'll be back again."}
{"text":"I have not been back to this location since the incident where my boyfriend and I ordered the steak. Not only was it well done when we ordered rare but the meat was thin and small for how expensive it was. We sent it back and it came back well done again. The manager was not very receptive or apologetic but did comp the meal as the cooking times were way over both times it was sent back. Disappointed."}
{"text":"This might be the worst of the Jacks I've been to. I've been here a few times and the story hasn't changed. The service is slow and inattentive. And I've sat in the 3 different areas of the restaurant and it's the same thing whether it was at the bar, in the restaurant, or on the patio. The food didn't do much to redeem the service either. Maybe I'm the fool because I keep coming back. The lone redeeming quality are the big screen TV's for sports. If someone has any other suggestions in the area for sports, I'm all ears."}
{"text":"Food 4/5, Ambience 3/5, Service 4/5

Packed on saturday night, had to take a bar table rather than eating in the dining room. The place gets busy around 6:45 with customers.

Server was attentive for our orders and food was prepared quickly. The bar tables are a bit crammed for all the plates and would be tight if you have more than 2-3 people. 

Menu:
Tuna guacamole - great appetizer, came with tortilla chips. The Ahi tuna was chopped and dressed with soy sauce, adds another taste profile to the guac. Tortilla chips can be more crisp

Chicken fingers - wanted a small plate as I having guac. The chicken was fried fresh and super juicy and tender. As advertised, not frozen. Can ask for sauce on the side. Goes great with coleslaw

Holy Smokes Burger - burger was juicy and not overcooked. However, the fries can be more crispy and the gravy on the side kinda tastes like Clubhouse.

Parking is tight so carpool if you can. Don't confuse the entrance with Scaddabush. Washrooms are clean and very chic."}
{"text":"(bellow is a short story, scroll down for the review)

Nad and I grabbed some drinks after work. at the Jack Astor's by Union Station we were given pretty good services by Nicki. so good I had to let the manager know. since i like getting creative (and also since we've been getting TERRIBLE service (if you can call it that) at Casey's right across the road) i decided to seek the manager and then had the following exchange with her:

Me - I am very pissed off! (i have a very mad look on my face)

Her (very frantically) - I'm sorry to hear that miss, come over here please, i promise i wont yell at you (yes, that's what she said, and no, i don't get it either...its possible i misheard her, but not very likely)

Me - Oh I am very very pissed off!!! (even madder now)

Her - Miss please, tell me what happened.

Me - I am so pissed off that other bars downtown don't have as good servers as you Nikki is

Her ( breathe again) Oh my! thank you!

Me Its all good. we'll be back 

so yeah, if you're ever by union station and want to get good service, off to Jack Ass you go and if she's there, ask for her. shes a delight.
(she knows Nad and Anna by name so tell her we say \"Hi\" if you smart enough to ask for her section.

Drinks: 2 Long Island Ice Teas and a Kiss and Tell. (sooo good!)
Food: Calamari and Crab Dip. Pretty darn good!!!
Over all we were very happy with food, drinks, and above all service."}
{"text":"Update to my review. I recently had bad service experience at the bar and the manager didn't help at all. I feel sad that this place it used to be nice and enjoyed going there every weekend. I  saw other customers had bad experience but I didn't know the details but after what I  experienced, I feel bad for them too. I am not going to go there anymore because I feel it will be a waste of money."}
{"text":"Bar tenders are so funny. I am having good time. The music is so good. It is club kind. It is loud and friendly. It is the Jack asters ever"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar. It is busy restaurant but the bar is not. A lot of people at the bar is just waiting for their seat. The service was not as fast as it should but not now a new lady start to serve and she is good. I hope it will stay that way . now the service is so good. She is watching and doing all right thinks. I am happy."}
{"text":"I use Yelp as my eating out bible. If I were only reply on the overall three star review of this place, and were not dragged by my friend to there, I probably won't put the rating in justice.

I had a Smokey Jacks Burger. It was not bad at all. I won't say it's the most impressive burger I've ever had: the beef could be juicier and more flavourful, but it's satisfying with rather reasonable price and portion. I had soup on the side, which is delicious and a big bowl. 
My friend had classic burger, for half salad and half fries on the side. It was a big plate for half salad. All together $11. Reasonable.

Overall, the burgers are decent, with reasonable price, satisfying size; the environment and location were great!"}
{"text":"Good but wouldn't drive across town for it!
I've been to one in Toronto and it was the bomb.com. Anyways we ordered the \"bouchée amuse poulet\" which looked like popcorn chicken. It came with 3 sauces and 3 different salts!  This appetizer came looking hot ,  but it was warm. So deceiving.

Then we got the grilled chicken sandwich with the goat cheese. Switched the fries for a Cesar salad and added an extra garlic mash potatoes. The  sandwich was very small and not filling at all. Couldn't find the goat cheese! Oh well.The bill came up to 40$ not bad at all.  Service was not too fast but not too log either. The waitress was nice and adorable.

This place is good for boys night out or watching a sports event."}
{"text":"Love the new bar setup. But I wish Jacks would stop playing those silly blooper reals. More regular TV please."}
{"text":"Not a bad chain restaurant. Garlic bread was good. Lettuce wraps were good. Jerk pork was good. Milkshake was good. Added a star because the server brought a big bottle of cock sauce (Huy Fong Sriracha) to the table."}
{"text":"not a sports bar, yes they have an amazing big screen that they show some sporting events on, but no sound, not even if you ask and not even if most of the people there are obviously watching the game...  foods ok, not the greatest... service is really good! but they false advertise themselves as a sports bar when instead they just play lame, annoying, loud music with a big TV on on the background....  what a waste of a screen... it annoyed me because clearly there were tons of leafs fans (all wearing paraphernalia) but they refused to put the volume on... sad, won't go back for a game, and the food isn't worth it..."}
{"text":"Update - the manager contacted me and apologized for the service that day . Happy that they follow up
With their customers and try to fix the situation  . I have updated the rating based on my post experience . 

Original post :?

We came here for dinner on Jan 26.

the steak was chewey and not cooked right . Some Chicken fingers were mushed together and were cold inside which means they were cooked in a hurry ? It's deep fried chicken. I don't know how you get that wrong at a restaurant. we asked for a takeaway box for the fries - that took another 25 minutes because they forgot. We didn't finish the steak - the server asked us why and we told her - so she she she will see if they can make it up to us . First good thing to happen . So we wait another 20 minutes so one shows up with an update . So we leave . 

From 7 to 9pm this was our experience. Servers were nice but food needs to be better . Maybe they were understaffed."}
{"text":"This Jack Astors is a weird one. Although it's always busy (mostly due to the patio in the summer) the service is never good enough, considering the amount of money you pay for food and drinks.

I went for dinner with my family and we waited 30 minutes before a waiter came to take our order. The food then took an age to arrive, and was really only \"OK\". The burger looked flat and unappetizing and my fajitas came with way too little toppings and tortillas. My Mom said the wings were ok, but they looked quite small to me and were drenched in sauce.

I definitely walked away unimpressed, and won't be back in a hurry. Fine for beers with some friends, but there are much better options around for food, and at lower prices."}
{"text":"Went in to pick up one of their \"big bowl salads \" 
Was very hungry felt like I was gonna actually  get a decent sized salad that would be filling. It was 20$ for basically a bowl of lettuce . Hardly any toppings inside. Extremely dissapointing. Not worth 20$ that's for sure and wish I didn't even give this place  one star.  Such a rip off. Was so hungry after had to find more food elsewhere ."}
{"text":"Why am I reviewing a chain like Jack Astor's, you ask? Because I'm not just reviewing any Jack's...I'm reviewing the NEW 2016 Jack's! 

I've been a devout Jack Astor's fan for years. I'd give the old Jack's a 3/5 - it's a lively space with plenty of different options on the menu, making it a good choice for dates, family outings and get-togethers with friends. It's not the best food I've ever eaten, but it's decent. The new menu that I was presented on Sunday, however, has bumped them up to a solid 4/5 - a full day has passed, and I'm still thinking about my meal!

THE GOOD:
- I visited the location outside the Scarborough Town Centre. This location was recently renovated, and it shows - it's still got the same JA look and feel, but the space at the entrance is much bigger and there are wider rows between tables. 
- Let's talk about the menu: W-O-W. Am I at JA or La Carnita? To my surprise (and great delight), JA now has beef, chicken and shrimp tacos! I went with the shrimp tacos, and while not quite as tasty as Grand Electric or La Carnita, they came pretty damn close. I was super impressed. For under $12 a pop, I'm going to be tempted to order these everytime I visit.
- For dessert, my girlfriend and I shared an order of donut holes. These came in a basket with powdered sugar, small wooden forks and three dips: caramel, a berry-flavoured one, and a chocolate dip with Baileys. They were like warm, spongy bundles of joy...I'm salivating just thinking about them. 
- I also want to note that I always get great service at JA. They know how to hire people who are funny, personable and charming, which really is the cherry on top of an awesome dining experience. 

THE BAD:
- Unfortunately, with change comes sacrifice, and that includes my favourite Jack Astor's menu item of all time: the Spinach, Artichoke and Goat Cheese Dip. It looks like I'll have to hit up Pinterest and make this at home myself... *tear* 

All in all, it seems that the executives at Jack Astor's are making some wise choices with regards to their recent menu revamp. I highly, highly recommend you check out the new 2016 Jack Astor's for yourself!"}
{"text":"Let's face it, Jack Astor's is Jack Astor's. I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, but once in a while we do like to come here for a casual drink because it's easy and we know we can watch the Raps win and the Leafs tank. (They play both games)

This location in particular has a HUGE TV. We are talking 20' x 20' or more. So it's great to watch the game in here. There are also a ton of other TVs. They know their audience.

The Good:

1. Sports. Great place to watch sports since you know what you're getting and will be guaranteed that the games will be on.
2. Atmosphere. Good mix of ages in here, fun and rowdy, but not too rowdy.
3. Decor. It's actually a cool location, lots to look at.

The Bad:

1. Service. As you can expect, service is not stellar by any means, but also wasn't terrible.
2. Cleanliness. The table was very sticky.
3. Chain. It's a chain resto, so don't expect to be blown away. And if you are, I'm afraid you might be basic.

Recommendation: catch the game here for casual beer with some buddies."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the service is awesome. I love our server Amy!!! Super friendly and made the experience just that more awesome. 

I had the \"meatless burger\" ha! Screw that I got them to put meat on that bad boy! The toppings sounded awesome and I wanted meat. Damn right I was getting it. 

To go with my awesome burger I got the new Lobster  Fries. Super yummy!! These are a must try if you come here. The ssuce is so good, lighter than hollandaise sauce. and so much lobster. It was better than I expected.

My boyfriend got the \" holy smoke bbq burger\" with extra banana peppers and fried onions. He loves it's, it's to die for.  Super spicy, very juicy, flavorful.. If you live spicy food you got to try this. To go with his burger he had the \" ghost pepper poutine\", which extra spicy and still amazing. So again love spicy food you have to try this.

This place is a must if you want amazing food, service, atmosphere and overall great night. Even if your here for drinks and appetizers you will never be disappointed. 

Again a big thank you to our server AMY!!! Super awesome person and amassing at making your night that much better."}
{"text":"I often stop here when I'm on my bike.  I've always found the service good and as chain resto food goes, it's pretty good.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and sweet potato fries which took a little bit longer to arrive than usual.  While I wasn't in any particular hurry, I was informed by the manager that it would be comped.  Bonus!!"}
{"text":"Food wasnt that good at all....drinks seemed watered down and both drinks were not as requested. 

The server made all the difforence thought leaving us somewhat content with our experience."}
{"text":"One of the better bars in the area (although Yonge & Bloor strangely doesn't have many decent casual bars). Food is only average and it's quite pricey, but a decent place for an after work pint. The space has been recently renovated and is much more open concept than before. Way too many TV screens although I guess they are catering for the sports bar crowd. A solid three stars."}
{"text":"I found this stick in my burger and almost chipped my tooth. The pitchers were flat. The staff was nice. Good and drinks sucked."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was good. The steak ordered was good to its optimal taste. It was medium rare when I ordered it. The veggies could of been made properly instead of frozen and boiled. The cocktail was not that bad, I got the blue raspberry lemonade but it was pretty good. Atmosphere was really good though. Would come again if I ever go back to Pickering."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot.  Funny every Jack Astors kind of epitomizes its own area.  Same deal here.  You have well dressed Yonge/Shep people who want to come in here.  A little bit like a bar that is \"hard to get\"in atmosphere (but not too bad at all).  And yes very friendly staff. 

Couple extra's?  The Patio is the best in Willowdale.  They actually let the bar Staff Flair on the downstairs.  I have personally witnessed a bar staff fill a pint, and THROW a pint (safely) at least 30 feet to his other staff who served the beer!

Yes, there are days it is too loud and you don't want to go.  Then there are days where the place is just right for you.  If you live in the city, you already know how Jack Astor's tastes... Now you know a bit about the bar.  

If in the area, pop in."}
{"text":"Poor service and food took forever. 

Came here on a Tuesday night after a concert. The place is packed and luckily we got seated right away in a corner. The drinks and water took 30 minutes. We got our food one hour later. No napkins, no cutleries and we had to eventually hunt our server for some napkins. The other servers tried to ignore us to avoid helping us. 

We spend almost 1.5 hours just waiting for our pitcher, water and food.

The server in the end blamed the slow service due to the rush from the blue jays game and concert. 

Do you not have more servers or kitchen staff on days when there's a blue jays game or concert going on?!?!!!

Probably won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a early dinner after work! We were seated in minutes and service was great! Very friendly and kept checking on us frequently! 

We ordered the vodka fish and chips, chicken parmejania (a pasta dish the included chicken topped with Parmesan cheese)

Both dishes were good, but preferred the fish over the pasta dish! We ended out day by ordering a dessert which was a huge cookie stuffed with a brownie and topped with vanilla ice! Loved it! 

The total bill came up to $45 which was amazing for the food and service we got!"}
{"text":"If I had to pick \"the best\" Jack Astors in the Greater Toronto Area, this location easily takes the cake.  However, it's a sponge cake, and if you were born in North America, you might not get the reference/joke. 

In terms of outdoor patios, probably the most 'happening' among all locations, in terms of service, definitely the best, and in terms of décor...it's exactly the same as all other locations.  
Despite it being located by three major Toronto Hotels, the tourist patronage is relatively low.  But the business district patronage is surprising high.  I thought yuppies ate in fancier (chain) restaurants, like..il Fornello? 

I had my 20th birthday dinner here, which was my first time visiting this location.  I think I booked a table of 18, and there were no problems.  With the exception of my rowdy friend Johara deciding to get up on an elevated chair and dance on top of it until she came crashing down into the booth of another table.  Thankfully, Johara is this insanely sexy woman who dressed extremely provocatively, so the guys at the booth was more than happy to receive her tumbling ass. 

Most recently, I was here with my buddy Ricardo to meet him for dinner.  He had a convention at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, and I was with my former CEO's daughter showing her a good time before ditching her ass at a undisclosed location.  We were both in Dress Uniforms(official business), but thankfully the restaurant didn't have any drunken hooligans who's attention we would have bound to catch.  
I am not particular on my waitress referring to me as 'guy',  but since I was in uniform, I had to let it slide.  It had nothing to do with the fact that our waitress had giant tits and was in her twenties.  I promise. 
Two suits who sat by the bar was occasionally shooting glances at us, but nothing in a \"I'm a liberal and I hate war\" kind of way.  One of them looked like Anderson Cooper. 

The food was mediocre, and but service was un-intrusive.  On busy nights this place livens up, especially the patio area.  Unfortunately the patio has umbrellas, and so for those who enjoy a cigarette, they must stand by a designated area and do their business in undignified fashion.  It really doesn't make sense if you think about it.  Why umbrellas on a patio?  If it were raining then nobody would sit outside, and this is hardly the place where sunny lunches are had.

When Ricardo and I asked for the bill, the waitress came back and told us that the two gentlemen sitting by the bar had secretly paid for our bills.  Out of appreciation for the Armed Forces, of course.  But they have left before we could have gotten the chance to thank them...so we left a giant tip. 
If you're an adult who is no longer controlled by your testosterone and motivated by alcohol, this really is just a after-work restaurant.  
Best Sponge cake, but still just a sponge cake.

Thanks Anderson Cooper!"}
{"text":"I came, walked to the table where six other friends of mine were, sat down, ordered a light poutine, a beer, and did put my most casual attitude on.  Holy crap was that ever I good idea, because if I wore my pompous ass face on that night, there would have been a fight, and this review would have been a rant.

The waitress we had talked to us like she was the Alpha Male of our group, and slammed the plates on the table when we told her something she didn't want to hear, and she made fun of us when someone needed to be made fun of..and we LOVED her!
I forgot her name (probably a good thing), but she was like that cool girl at school everyone wanted to hang out with because she was so badass.  It's almost impossible to not order something when she came and asked whether if we wanted more beer.  So when I said no after a single bottle, I felt like a little bitch when she looked at me with those disapproving eyes. 
Our friend Jennifer didn't end up liking her meal (her fault because she ordered pad thai at Jack Astor's), so the manager offered his apologies, and two gift vouchers to her.  All of the sudden, all of us wanted to not like our meals.  Truth was they did like it, with the exception of me and my poutine, but I was too much of a little bitch to say anything.  DAMMIT!

There are a lot of testosterone here, and on Saturday nights the entrance/parking lot looks like a Xzibit rap video.  I haven't witnessed any fights, and generally its a friendly atmosphere.  There's not much I can say about this Jack Astor's that I haven't said about any other Jack Astor's.  At least nobody asked me for deposit my ID so that I don't dine & dash like the Bloor & Yonge location.
Most character of all the other Jack Astor's, best staff and most chillin' scene, yo.


When we left, Sarah asked whether if there was any lollipops, and the manager brought out the box and just stuffed the purses of every girl with teeth rotting magic.  WOOT"}
{"text":"It was the worse dinner out in awhile quality wasn't good there was 5 of us  moms night out with 3  small children...none of us enjoyed it poor quality sorry none of us will go back again either way back in the day Jack Astor's used to have the best wings in town now I can write them 2 out of 10 we spent around  200.d there .... Not again...
.."}
{"text":"Often go to Jack's for work events and birthdays and the atmosphere and food is usually pretty good. Prices are not really practical but the portion sizes are good enough. The last few times I've been here I've noticed that their service has been lacking; getting wrong orders, my friends orders never came and very slow. If you want to have a good time just go to the bar area and have a drink or two, you'll find some really loud people in there. 
My favorite martini is called the Nemo! It's a yummy fruity drink. Love their chicken fingers with blue cheese dip, bowties pasta, chicken Caesar salad, classic poutine, and the huge meatball pasta."}
{"text":"I used to work here when it first opened many years ago. The crazy atmosphere was always fun. They certainly have muted their tone since though. But in a good way. I'd say atmosphere is just more a typical lounge like restaurant. 

The best part though, is the food. For over a decade I have LOVED their bow tie pasta. I always ask for the kitchen to spice it up for me and they nail it every time! The way the chicken is done is so perfect! And this is coming from someone who only meat I do eat is chicken, says a lot. 

I don't live in that part of the city anymore but it's certainly worth the trip to the south end for their food."}
{"text":"Overpriced everything, low quality food. Save your money and go down the road to Nome, It's more luxurious and cost less. You would have to be foolish to pay $20+ for a burger, when Hero burgers is a quarter the price and down the road. Really not worth it, No offence."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my bf on a late Wednesday afternoon, so the place was pretty empty. As soon we walked in, we were asked if we wanted to sit downstairs, or up. Both floors have booths, but I wanted to sit on the upper level which is nice and huge with lots of television screens.

Because we really didn't come here for lunch or dinner, but rather drinks, I really like this place for it. I am sure my experience would have been much different if we came here on a Saturday night, so if you want a mid-break drink, you should come to this Jack Astor's location.

I tried two large cans of Cider, which is basically spiked apple juice (yes please!) And then, I felt like having another beer, so I ordered (name escapes me now) some local brand which tasted like stale bread. My bf and I shared a combination of appetizers, including the bruschetta smothered in that lovely white sauce. This was a little bit of a disappointment, as we were thinking it would taste exactly like the one's served at the Front Street location.

This was also a pre-birthday celebration, so my bf told the server about my bday. Out came a big cake with ice cream and a candle, which I thought was a very nice touch. All in all, I had a great, time here. We basically had the upper level to ourselves, and my bf and I chatted the afternoon away.

Great mid-week early lunch or dinner place in the Entertainment district."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Jack Astor's for its booth seating. I always come here when it's usually empty and around late afternoon. 

It was a lovely hot day. And I felt like Jack Astor's yummy Bruschetta with that delish Mayo (?) sauce they smother the bread in. But of course this Jack Astor's location has NO SUN on its patio. Completely covered in shade - what a waste. Despite the sunless patio, I still wanted to sit outside because it was warm. WRONG! It soon got REALLY cold so my bf and I requested to be moved back inside. I saw other groups do the same thing.

Our outdoor waiter (Andrew) was really cool. I wish we had him inside. Our lady waitress was grumpy because she had lots of tables to wait (4). Anyways, I couldn't complain because I had 3 glasses of the \"Pink Juice\" which is a Rose. It was alcoholic, but if felt like it had NO alcohol. I wanted to order the Bud Light Platinum, but our waitress said they discontinued it. So, if you're looking to try the light beer that has 6% alcohol (!!!), you're out of luck. Both my bf and I were not that hungry so we just shared a salad and a burger. For dessert, we had the tiny Brownie Bite (at 96 cents) so you can't go wrong.

Overall, I wouldn't come out of my way to eat here, but it is a restaurant that I am familiar with and centrally located. The interior is big and roomy, and the booths are comfy. If you're okay with sunless patio (and a bit chilly), than this location has it.

FYI. The patio has a smoking and non-smoking section and there is a separate hostess for outside seating."}
{"text":"so, i was in montreal for a project i'm working on with a bunch of dudes from my firm's other office.  all ages, all lifestyles.  basically, we had to go with lowest common denominator for dinner.  which ended up being this place.

it reminded me of a bennigans or max and ermas.  you know, big menu, decent food, decent drink menu, terrible music.

we were there an hour and a half and all they played was britney spears.  my burger was overcooked (actually, was not even given an option when i ordered) but the sweet potato fries were good and the wait staff was nice enough, albeit slow.

they did have my the twin of my elvis bust in clear view of my table though, so it made me feel at home.

overall:  good for a general crowd pleaser, but i wouldn't go back if i had my way."}
{"text":"One of my favourite locations. I came here on a weekend to watch the Raptor's game so as expected the bar area was packed. We were seated at the edge of the bar, but I didn't mind as long as I could see the screen. 

The crowd that gathers there for games is awesome. 

Jack Astor's food is as expected. we ordered the beef chili nachos and a few pints of Guiness. It was really delicious and even though they were really busy at the bar they brought extra napkins and brought extra hot sauce quick time when I asked for it. 

There was a bit of a commotion because someone at the bar wanted to watch a hockey game and was drunk already making a kerfuffle. The Bartender was really great and dealt with it very professionally. The manager eventually had to ask the person to go. (I cheered inside when this happened). 

Good food, good beer and a good show!"}
{"text":"Gotta love Jack's!

Went on a Thursday night, best to get there early as it gets busy.  The staff is uber friendly and service was great.

Great for drinks and apps, we has the Nachos which were nice. Also ordered the chicken dippers, interesting... they were good but wasn't sure about the various sauces and seasonings. All in all decent though.

Of course washed it all down with cold draught beer. They have a reasonable selection on tap.  Recommended."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there, hoping to enjoy a drink, some delicious food, and some sun on their spacious patio. This was about 3pm on a Wednesday. There was plenty of wait staff around. However we sat there for more than 15 minutes without some one even stopping by to say hello. We walked out (1st time I ever had to do this)"}
{"text":"First of all it was so loud you couldn't even hear yourself think! The place was very busy for a Saturday night but the food came quite fast which was good. It was hard to find our waitress but she was very polite and bubbly. My friend had a chicken sandwich and she felt a bit cheated but how much chicken that was actually put in there. So I don't know if that was because they were busy or if there trying to do a bit of cheating. All in all food was good but noisy location."}
{"text":"Haven't been here  in a while, menu's changed a bit.
The \"holiday\" hush puppies were meh, calamari was decent, my NY strip was cooked well, nice char at medium rare, friendly staff.  My husband liked his chicken parm, and my daughter liked her cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Despite recent menu changes I still wouldn't recommend going for a meal.  Portions are small and at time it seems they are measuring every single french fry they give you.  Overall it's subpar food for the price. 

Drinks are reasonable and it's a good place to catch up with friends or for a drink after work if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Jack Astor's offers a bit of everything your craving they have pastas burgers fajitas salads rice bowls really everything. The ambience is one of a sports bar and the space is big. The wait time for the food was longer then most places. The food was decent but I'd probably try something else."}
{"text":"This Super Bowl we were a little late in making our bookings and the only place we got reservations for in such short notice was Jack Astor's. 

The place had screens everywhere and you could watch the game easily but the food was a big disappointment! I'm the sort of person who enjoys good food and drinks, especially during a game. We ordered appetizers mainly, starting with guacamole which was so baaaad! OMG! It was the worst! It was watery and tasted a little off (very off and I'm not even going to mention the quantity), all of us agreed that it was probably made from an instant mix pack... yuck. Next was the calamari and it was ok. Then there was the chicken wings which were dry,there wasn't enough sauce on them (its like they forgot because I saw the plates coming out from the kitchen and everyone else's looked good). Next was the Bruschetta and pizzas, this was good! Definitely try that ,but I guess anything would have tasted better after the disastrous appetizers. 

Will not be going again...

PS: The service was good, our server was a guy called Lance (aka Khal Drogo!) and he made sure to come around often enough but never during a play. :)"}
{"text":"I normally try to avoid franchises but I somehow stumbled upon this Jack Astors in Whitby and had such a wonderful experience that I promised myself I would yelp about it! I went on a Friday night and wow - it was bumping! What an incredible atmosphere. I especially liked the layout of this specific location with their heavy emphasis on booths. In terms of food, we stuck with the usual suspects and they did not disappoint. They did not cheap out on the cheese curds on my poutine like other places so that's bonus points right away. I also got Jacks famous chicken fingers (Buffalo sauce of course) and they lived up to their famous moniker. My wife got the bow tie pasta. Simple dish but a classic that always hits the spot. Overall, the food, service and atmosphere were great and completely blew past my expectations. If you're ever in the Durham region make sure you drop in!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat, even for my birthday or Halloween dinner. Also great for a Christmas Eve dinner also."}
{"text":"I called to make reservations from the Hazelton Lanes Hotel as everywhere else was fully booked, nobody picked up. I decided to walk to the location. It was open. 

The only other Jack Astor's in the city I'm aware of where the Maitre' D stood outside by the patio is the one on Front. But that one had a much better patio. I asked whether if the kitchen was still open at this late hour of 12:20, she said \"yes\", and then she said \"grab a menu.\"
I didn't understand what she meant, so I ignored her and sat myself.
I was in my seat with my friend for a whole five minutes before I got up myself and asked the waitress for a food menu to be brought to our table. Why weren't there any menus at the table? I never had to get my own menu before.

The waitress arrived at our table, but instead of taking our orders, she ask us for our credit cards, or some form of identification. What?!
Apparently, they've been experiencing a very high level of 'dine & dash' lately, and this was their new policy to combat that issue. 
Really? Was this abroad? Do I have to cough up my personal information prior to every meal from now on at Jack Astor's? This is ridiculous! I gave her my health card.
Thus the reason I'm reviewing this place, as I don't usually review chained restaurants. But what an unique experience, I felt compelled to share!

I never ordered the lobster & crab dip before, couldn't hurt. It wasn't bad, but the way it was arranged reminded me of an African Safari watering hole during the dry season. The little pool of water being the dip, and a thousand different specifies of animals being the chips crowded around trying to get a piece of the action. Com'on, how much lobster & crab are actually in here? At least they could have been more generous with the mayonnaise.
On the menu it said the fish n' chips came with two fillets, I only got one. It was a good size, but it was still false advertising. I don't remember what my friend ordered, I was busy looking at all the make-up on her face. You see, she's a beauty blogger and we've just came from a magazine launch. She had to glam up, and I was curious as to which part of her face she was actually born with.
Everyone knows what Jack Astor's look like, so there's no point mentioning the décor. The staff here are just like any other Jack Astor's, forced to look like their life long dream of working here has been attained, and everything was wonderful. I wonder if that's another one of their policies.

The bill came, but I had to remind our waitress about my health card.
I asked the waitress what was the best escape route.
 
Seriously, my friend was wearing seven inch heels, and my outfit was completely unarrow-dynamic...you're bound to catch one of us!"}
{"text":"Landed in Toronto pretty late and stopped by here to grab a quick meal. We ordered the chicken tenders - hot, and they were pretty good. The tenders were juicy and cooked perfect. Came with some fries that were good as well.
Service was awesome. Extremely helpful and polite. Gave some helpful suggestions and even talked us into ordering dessert (even though we probably didn't need much convincing). 
They also have a ton of tv's everywhere."}
{"text":"Its a nice place and I have been there couple of times before but I was disappoitnted with them last week.  It seems like they were way overbooked with Christmas parties and couldnt handle the crowd very well.  It seems like its not the best place to be during holidays as this place is too overwelmed."}
{"text":"It's a good place for a casual dinner. Food is good most if the time. Service can be a little slow and place can get very busy and noisy. As a result its not the best place if you want to chat wit your date or a friend. One of the negative things is that their menu is very hard to read: white on black.... In the dark surroundings is not very good.. Other than they are ok."}
{"text":"We went to Jack Astor's on Valentine's day. We asked for chicken and steak fajitas, they were good but I found the place pricey for being a pub."}
{"text":"Had the worse service here. There wasn't many people in the restaurant but the waitress was slow to bring food and also took them forever to bring the bill. They screwed up the bill and waited over 15 for her to bring the correct bill to us and another 5 minutes for her to bring the credit machine. Almost everyone pays by card these days. Should always have the machine on hand even if customer is paying by cash. The food was not the best. The garlic pan bread was so salty I think I had enough for the week! Where are my fries?? I swear there are less and less fries each time I eat here. C'mon guys, fries costs pennies. When I first ate at jack Astors a few years ago the fries overflowed the plate. Then they started putting them in bowls and the bowls are now virtually empty, the fries are now below the rim. Suffice to say we left hungry and severely disappointed with their food and slow service. Money not well spent. Avoid like the plague!"}
{"text":"I went there for my dad's birthday a long time ago, but i remember that we all enjoyed our food, and the service was good too. A bit expensive but worth it ( lots of places in centropolis are a bit expensive )"}
{"text":"Okay, the family and I were driving south on Macleod Trail last Friday and were looking for a place to eat. I was in the mood for Chinese, or Vietnamese. I was quickly shot down, and told how unhealthy those choices were. Okay so we passed Ginger Beef, Rice for King, Kinjo's. I know Kinjo's is Japanese, but we had Japanese last week. My kids see Macdonald's, and say why don't we eat there. They always want to eat there. I said no way, lets pick something a little healthier. 
Then we get to the traffic lights approaching Southland Dr. I see Jack Astor's. \"Hey, what about Jack Astor's\" ? my kids start to laugh because I say the word ass. We haven't been since this place was Fuddruckers.
I have to say the inside has changed quite a bit, since I last stepped foot into this place.We were greeted by three hostesses, then quickly seated to a booth on the back of the restaurant. I proceeded to look at the menu, and thought to myself am I getting old or what ? I can hardly make out the print on the menu. It was so dark, I could hardly make out the print. Two waitresses then came to our table and introduced themselves and wrote their names on the throw away paper lining the table. Like Montana's, the one girl's name was KT. 
Since I was in the mood for some Chinese, I saw on the menu a spicy chicken dish that was accompanied with fresh veggies and steamed rice.
I know, I know, should've known better then to order a Chinese dish at a western styled restaurant, that was more burger and salad like.
The chicken, was these little cubes of chicken (like the kind you buy frozen at Co-op.) spicy, and the rice was soggy in the middle and dry around the edges. I think I got the bottom of the rice cooker. The veggies on the other hand were okay. The other items ordered was a burger, that was okay (nothing special) and  yam fries and a salad. I also have to mention that my dinner was like $17.00.
I thought that was a lot for something that didn't even taste as good as a Swansons frozen T.V. dinner.
I won't be back for a LONG TIME !
When I do, I'll order something different.
In closing, I would like to add that I was surprised at the amount of families eating here."}
{"text":"Love the food there but the service is so bad that I have not gone back in a while. It use to be my favorite place and was so happy when I moved back to the area from Ottawa to find out they had one here. 

The steak and the fully loaded bake potato was my #1 choice and I also love the super greasy garlic bread. Let's not forget the blue jacked up lemonade.

But the last time I went was awful. It took forever to even see a waiter, he took our order and we got the drinks right away but it went downhill from there. They brought our appetizer at the same time as the meal. I had no fork or knife and it took a long time to waive someone down to get them. My food was cold, my drink was empty and we never got water or even better the waiter NEVER CAME BACK...anyway all around it was bad and I will not go back."}
{"text":"Been to the one in Dorval and I had been disappointed and actually stopped going but when they open one in Laval I was quite happy and decided to give it one more chance. The first time I visited the place was at the beginning and we got beef nachos and jerk pork and both were horrible. My trusted blue lemonade was ok and so was the cyclone.

I thought maybe it was bad because they had just open so I went again last week (over a year or more since they open) and it was pretty much the same experience.

We got bad and slow service the waitress messed up our drink order and they took 34 minute to come back with them. So we at that time ordered our food. We got regular nachos and they were decent, we got a pound of wing and those were not good at all they tasted old like they were reheated. We also got some fries with what looks like feta cheese on top and chimmy cherry sauce but they put so much garlic that it kept me up the whole night.

So all this to say that I will not go back even if they open one the moon."}
{"text":"My 85 year-old father left his favourite cap at this restaurant. He called from Northern Ontario to ask if they had it, and if they could mail it to him (and he would reimburse the expense).  They mailed it to him, and when he called to thank them and to arrange to send a cheque, they said not to worry about it.  He was dealing with Dorilyn Cooper, Events Manager.  Now that is customer service!  Thanks."}
{"text":"For a restaurant at the heart of downtown it was nothing more than average. The staff was nice, but the food was not that nice. My steak was chewy and tastless. I was expecting better."}
{"text":"I have come here couple of time during lunch with my coworkers and the experienced has always been high wait times on getting the food out of the kitchen.

The server are friendly and quick to take order and get the payment done. The only flaw is the food takes a fair bit amount of time.

People loving sports will love this location as their are TV in all direction and have multiple games on.

Over all the menu is decent as its more than just a bar menu."}
{"text":"J'ai été surprise et étonnée par le Jack Astor's. Honnêtement, je m'attendais a un genre de restaurant américain du style Boston Pizza, ou la bouffe y est assez dispendieuse et grasse, mais service rapide. En effet, c'est un peu ça. Sauf que c'est canadien. On nous plonge dans un décor a thématique humoristique, des télévisions avec des gags qui roulent en boucle et autres pancartes nous indiquant que ' si on veut voir le gérant, pas de problème, ils en ont justement quelques un dont ils pourraient se débarrasser '. 

La sélection d'alcools est rafraîchissante. J'ai bû une limonade maison, sublime. Essayez l'Iceberg : le mélange parfait entre slush et bière. 

Pour la bouffe, un menu typique de style chaîne, mais revampé éclectiquement a la sauce internationale. Une bonne section de sandwich allant du classique Club au burger au bacon fumé. Aussi, une panoplie d'autres plats pas toujours fidèle a la thématique. Je me dis qu'au Canada on est multiculturels alors c'est démontré ici ... ( Kafta d'agneau a la libanaise & Poulet au beurre a l'indienne, pour ne nommer que ceux-la) La pizza ' poulet-tu avoir une pizza bbq ' était délicieuse. Et Le burger smokehouse également. La salade césar est vraiment a recommander. PLEIN DE BACON.

Le service impeccable et super sympathique. Les prix super raisonnable. Les desserts : horriblement cochons."}
{"text":"Typical Jack Astors. What you expect from the franchise is what you'll get. Cute servers and good service. They have lots of beer on tap. Do try their Woodchuck cider and dos equis on tap this summer. Not on special but it's refreshing. Oh and their patio is now open with DJ too (and a bar outside) but expect it to be packed from 5 to 8 because it's after work hours and you're going to get all the local office workers there complaining about their work day (me included). Their nachos are still the best. Other dishes are typical. So if you're looking for a place to chill, it's great here and it's convenient because it's 10 mins from Union Station whether you're taking GO bus or the GO train or the subway! There are also lots of taxis in this area. So don't worry you can drink and still get home safe :) Oh and the washrooms are downstairs. So don't drink to the point you cant navigate a few steps. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Casual Bday dinner with my nieces.
Food was cold for everyone except for the chicken fingers for the kids and my daughters chicken sandwich).
Meals came out in waves over several minutes. 
Everyone's garlic mash was cold, and was sent back. When my sister's came back out and while hot, was not mashed (very lumpy). My wife's steak / veggies /garlic mash came out next and was all cold.
After some more back and forth everyone's potatoes had come out again, however I still did not have my meal.

While waiting on the manager, my food finally came out (southern fried chicken with poutine....fries were cold, gravy was warmish, and the sandwich was not hit either).
At this point my daughter discovered plastic in her sandwich (but at least it was hot?!).
We really didn't eat much of anything,  and me nothing. 
Thanks to the manager for waiving the bill and for the gift cards.
I'm not sure that we will be back to this location anytime soon.

Wholly disappointing experience.

Hopefully they can get their act together. 0/5"}
{"text":"Service is questionable, but based on the other options in this area, jacks isn't so bad. 

Madly in love with the rooftop patio! It's even heated, in case you're wearing something from earlier in the day and didn't realize that it would be chilly later. 

I've been here a handful of times as again, there's not much else in the area that me and my best friend agree on, and other than the service (once waited 60mins+ for a pitcher i asked for three times) its alright. 

BLT poutine is pretty good though, I wasn't a huge fan of it the first time but if you're hungry, it isn't bad. 

There's kind of a clubby-atmosphere to it, especially the patio, but if you can deal with it, you'll be fine. A touch on the pricey side. 

Ok, say something nice. OH, I like how they have \"jacked up\" (read: very large pints) of beer. This keeps happy Rosie happy. 

Otherwise, eh."}
{"text":"If you're heading to Jack Astors for a meal, you probably already know what to expect. Young inexperienced wait staff and cooks, run of the mill chain restaurant atmosphere, very standard food, and brown paper table clothes.

This place is no different. The one thing that sets this place apart from other Jack Astor restaurants is the extremely large bar area (potentially even bigger than the dining area) with lots of high top tables and a couple pool tables. I have heard that they get quite busy late Friday & Saturday nights with people coming in for drinks.

Of all the restaurants in the Scarborough Town Center area, this restaurant has the biggest, sunniest patio.

One thing I will say about this place, in it's favour, is I've been here with groups of ~20 ppl a few times and they always do a decent job with our group. Ahead of time we send in everyone's individual orders, and the time we'd like our food ready for and they consistently get it right.

Jack Astors is a popular chain, so they must be doing something right, but given the option, I would always skip it."}
{"text":"This location is just like every other Jack Astor's with one key difference: 

on Thursday night's IF you ask them \"Do you do half price appetizers tonight?\" they have to say yes. 

You can only get this deal if you ask though. They use to offer it and then took it away but will honour the deal for people that come in and ask for it.

Tonight's dinner was \"shanghai lettuce wraps\" for less than $5 and the person I was with had wings (which also fall under the half price appetizer deal).

They have a nice patio for the summer. 

A classy joint? Definitely not. But it is predictable, and you've got to laugh at tackiness of servers scrawling their names and times they visited your table all over your brown paper table clothe."}
{"text":"I had just checked in to my hotel and was starving, this was close to the hotel and had a good variety.  The service was excellent and the food good.  I had a chicken sandwich that was tasty but the piece of chicken could have been a little bigger.  They have a great selection of beers and the prices were reasonable.  I would definitely return on my next trip."}
{"text":"Yellow light, not sure about suggesting it to you. We got the chicken pad thai and one rice bowl with seared tuna. Beside the high prices for what they offer, food wasn t cooked right and the quality was poor. The personnel was friendly and the ambience is of a pub that probably should stick on fries, burgers and chicken wings that is what they are known for and that i should try next time I have to go there because i don't have a better option in the area."}
{"text":"For a chain, it delivers. I really do love the Jack Astors close to Union Station, but this one is close to home!

LOVE the bruschetta with that creamy sauce and diced tomatoes. I ordered the Salmon and my fiance ordered a chicken sandwhich. He was expecting some Focaccia-type bread, but all he got was chicken between two burger buns. 

It was relatively early when we went (5:30 on a Saturday night). You can choose to sit on the main level (bar) or eat at the main dining room (upstairs) where you have the cozy booths and various televisions playing a variety of sports.

Service was great! Yeah for Moose our waiter.

Again, for a chain, it is what it is, but sometimes you just want to relax and order a bottle of red for $25 (vs. $50 at some fancy restaurant for the same varietal) and eat fries.

Great addition to North York! And the patio looks great (I will try in the summer)."}
{"text":"I went their for a work colleagues leaving away during lunch time. The service was good, food came out warm, we were greeted at the gate and were checked once the food was being eaten. 

So I tired there new Tuna Avocado sandwich. The sandwich summed up with Sesame crusted Ahi tuna, avocado, sliced tomato, chipotle mayo, toasted sourdough bread. I did not enjoy the sandwhich at all, for some reason the combination of the things mentioned above did belong together in a sandwich bit the fries were good!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good beer. Abysmal service.

We waited and waited and waited for our server (the place was less than half full) and when she finally showed up - she sucked. Never checked on us, forgot our drinks, etc.

I was happy with my meal, however. I had the fajitas and they were well seasoned, well proportioned and completely delicious. I also loved my beer (Rickards Red). The rest of group was equally happy with their meals (mainly steak salads and fajitas).

One suggestion I would have for this place would be to get rid of the wait staff / management and let the diners go back and place their own orders, get their own food, etc. I know it sounds unrealistic, but the only thing I can find wrong with this restaurant is the service... it was a total train-wreck."}

Food: 2/5 Not a fan.
Service: 3/5 Never around. Manager is helpful.
Environment: 4/5 Great for sporting events.
Washrooms: 4/5 Meh.
Worth it?: 3/5 Environment is fun. Food could be better.

I Just kidding. It's not that bad. The food really isn't that great. Their summer specials for Canada's 150th is very disappointing. We tried to the Montreal smoke meat poutine. The cheese was hard and there was not very much smoked meat. Just allot of pickles.

If you can get over the food, the environment is nice. It is great for watching sporting events. Just make sure it's big enough of an event for them to turn the sound up.

Service never seems to be around. They seemed well staffed but they are always all in the back or somewhere else. The manager however is quite helpful. My order came out wrong and he was quick to get things in order for me. 

There are too many options around for me to give it another go. Sorry."}
{"text":"First time in Toronto and first time at Jack Astors. Coming from a small town i felt completely overwhelmed and my head was spinning! Our server Nikki completely understood and took great care of us. Explaining the menu, making recommendations and just being overall awesome! We received a complementary appetizer to get a feel for the type of food. I had the sauced up chicken fingers and fries and it was delicious!! My only upset is that I didn't get to go back before coming home! So to Nikki at Jack Astors on Bloor.. you provided the best service and definitley deserve commendation for making us feel comfortable while being out of my comfort zone!"}

I tried the poutine. Would've been better HOT.

My honey did confirm that his beer was cold...so we'll end wth his: Go to Jack Astor's if you're thirsty ONLY."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner and needless to say the food was average - by average I mean in terms of taste and presentation. 

I've been to a different location before which served really yummy nachos but the ones they have here are called board nachos, which has a different layout and wasn't as great as I expected it to be. My friends and I shared a bunch of appetizers (chicken quesadilla, garlic cheese pan bread, chicken wings, calamari, sweet potato fries, and Caesar salad) along with an entrée: bow-tie pasta (I know, we ate a lot but we have no shame) Everything was fine, but the pan bread was way too greasy I stopped eating it after one bite. 

In terms of service, the hosts who seated us and the servers were relatively friendly and served the food fast, but at the same time there weren't as many people today. However I wasn't completely satisfied knowing the host made all 6 people squish into a booth when there were a bunch of free tables with sufficient space, not to mention when all of us girls have purses that take up space. The atmosphere was appropriate for your typical Jack Astor's, so no surprises there."}
{"text":"A place you go to watch games, not for the food. I can't recommend a single thing on their menu, other than their burgers. Ask them for jalapeños and they'll bring you green peppers and claim it's \"fresh jalapeños, that's why it's not spicy\". *insert face where I raise my eyebrows. Huh?"}
{"text":"This location is slightly smaller than the others. Our group of 9 came for lunch with a reservation. They had an assembly line going of large parties being ushered in, served, bussed, torn down and reset. Each member of our party was given a number written on the table in front of us and that is how the servers referred to us-a bit impersonal, but I get it, they're busy and it's difficult to deal with groups, however the whole service felt rushed, just trying to get us through for the next table I guess? As usual the food is actually very good for a chain, and they offer decent veggie options as well. Not a bad option in you're in the area or have a big group (but don't make a special trip just for this)."}
{"text":"This place is always packed - try and make reservations if you're coming with a large party.
Food is always decent and staff is always friendly. They try and be creative with their menu and change it up here and there which is great because it keeps things fun.
Great patio as well to people watch."}
{"text":"Poor service and raw burger. It took 40 min for my friend's chicken dippers to come to the table after we asked them about it a few times and cancelling it. My burger was rare in the middle. The server justified it by saying \"it sometimes turns out this way\". A burger should only be raw if the customer asks for it that way, which I didn't since she never asked how I'd like my burger done. She then proceeded to laugh at me when I told her you can get E. coli from a raw burger. Look it up lady. You're not the one who learned about it in infectious diseases class. Poor service overall from this server. The manager that night handled things very professionally though. That's probably the only good thing I have to say about this place."}
{"text":"my review is a little late as I was here on Friday with some of my friends from the east end, as this location was a regular Thursday night place for my coworkers and I for many many years. 

with the weather being so nice on we wanted to sit on the patio, come'on who wouldn't? 

we sat for the time being at a communal table and asked to be seated at a different table when one became available. although we had some horrible service from the server who was originally helping us - we asked to speak to the manager to let them know how disappointed we were. 

When Trica came out to talk to us, she was very  empathic and understanding - our biggest frustration was the waitress never came back to ask if we wanted dinner and one of the apps we ordered didn't come. We definitely didn't expect her to take care of our bill and give us dinner but we were truly grateful for her hospitality! She was even kind enough to change our server to Mark who was truly phenomenal! I will definitely continue to return here :)

Thanks Trica & Mark for the awesome experience that could have been sour! You're the reason this is a 5 star, recommendation!"}
{"text":"This Jack Astor's isn't necessarily the best one or the worst one - what they have is very good staff. I've never had a bad experience here with their wonderful staff. However, I just keep being slightly disappointed by the food and somewhat the ambiance at this location. This is probably the most boring location, which I suppose is no fault of the actual establishment. I just prefer the Scarborough location better because of music and fun etc. Also, the wings were OK at best. I give it a solid 'ok'."}
{"text":"Great place for watching the game with friends or a quick bite. I would definitely recommend to start off with the shanghai lettuce wraps. They are amazing if you like an appetizer with a kick!"}

{"text":"I have always loved this particular Jack Astors since I first visited Toronto a few years ago.

So when I moved here i made sure to keep coming and it still has the great service, atmosphere, drinks and food selection as always.

Can not wait until summer so I can start sitting on the outdoor patio, one of my best memories of Toronto was me and my good friends drinking Corona outside with the view of dundas square.

great place"}
{"text":"I came here with my 2 1/2 year old son and my sister for a casual sit-down dinner. I was pleasantly surprised by everything, particularly the quality of the food and exceptionally attentive service!

I got the miso tuna bowl. I had low expectations ordering something \"Asian\" at a Jack Astor's, but the crunchiness of the greens, the freshness of the tuna, and the tangy-umami-combination of the vinaigrette dressing was a total pleasant surprise. My son and sister both had pizza which was pretty standard (and done reasonably well).

Service was excellent, and particularly child-centric for my son. They provided him with two toys to play with at the table, which kept him happy all through the dinner service. 

Definitely a great option for casual sit-down food in the area!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a lively bar scene and good atmosphere rolled into a restaurant, this is the place. Although I would not recommend this location for a family outing, I found our Saturday night to be a great time!

Jacks offers all the classic chain restaurant options, as well as a fun drink menu and a plethora of flatscreen tv's. May I recommend the raspberry iceberg beer!

Be prepared for a wait to get a table, but we sat in the bar area and waited all of 5 minutes. The crowd seemed to be early-mid twenties, lively but not out of control. 

Fairly different than other Jacks I've been to, as it seems to be more bar, less restaurant, BUT a great spot if you're looking for fun drinks with friends."}
{"text":"I like Jack's, and as some other people mentioned, it's a pretty standard chain restaurant with quite consistent meals, presentation, service etc.

To the person who posted about the veggie burger, I was told they're not cooked near the beef burgers (I don't think anywhere remotely nice does that anymore, due to so many veggies or people with religious beliefs that don't eat beef) BUT the bun has egg in it, there's honey in the BBQ sauce and the mushrooms are apparently cooked in anchovy paste. That last tidbit was a real shocker to me, but they were very accommodating when I asked for it sans BBQ sauce and plain 'shrooms on the side. 

For anyone who drinks, I highly recommend the mango sapphire Jackarita, delicious!"}
{"text":"Fabulous staff who were able to accommodate us on very short notice, a group of 15 people who walked over from work nearby, we were seated IMMEDIATELY and the food was very prompt and delicious. If you are careful you can get good food at good prices (I had soup) but if you arent careful it can be very very pricey. Also not too much healthy on the menu but if you are careful you can find something (ie SOUP! DELISH!)"}
{"text":"Great bar food. We are in the bar. Casadillas very good along with the Caesar salad. Jean Danielle the host couldn't have been more accommodating. Got us settled and recommended. Checked in with us periodically.  Our server Marylou was bubbly and adorable."}
{"text":"Second time I've been here. First time with the boys. Like any Saturday night it was extremely busy. We had a party of 8 and were seated within 30 minutes. The service was slow but very accommodating. They brought out the kids meals quickly but faltered on the adult's meals. We ended up leaving and having our meals packed to go because the kids were done 1.5 hours in. But I have to give credit to management. They took our entrees off the final bill. I was not expecting that whatsoever. 

You have to try their lobster crab dip appetizer. It's really good. 

I had their Brie Burger. Very good combination of fixings and Brie cheese. I recommend it. 

I would come back again."}
{"text":"Popped in here on a Friday night with my girlfriends for a GNO. The line up to sit was crazy, we waited about 45 mins to get seated and that too we got the restaurant over the bar.

the service was okay, managing for how busy the restaurant was, but it was more \"flag me down when you decide\" instead of \"what can I get
you today?\" 

the food came out in a timely manner along with our drinks. The server was very interested in pitching a job there to us, letting us know how much he makes a year in tips (total turn off from the restaurant). 

I've always had a bad experience at restaurants in this plaza. there was nothing amazing about my visit nor was here anything horrific to complain about, definitely won't be a first option to return too."}
{"text":"Went to Jack Astors with a group of 16. Our servers name was Randy. Service was okay and food was good - no complaints on that. The issue we had was that there was an automatic gratuity added to the bill and it was not disclosed to us and we all ended up double tipping the server. 

Very upsetting because it wasn't clear to us that we were being charged an automatic gratuity - it should have been communicated to us."}
{"text":"I went to Jack Astor's last week with my son and my wife. My wife ordered vegetarian Pad Thai but she forgot to tell that she does not even eat eggs. When her order arrived it had egg on it. I had ordered Shrimp Pad Thai but instead I got chicken Pad Thai. When we told the server, she apologized and offered to replace the dish right away. Then her boss came and she apologized profusely. At the end she said we will not be charged for the two dishes. We were pleasantly surprised. 
I was really impressed with how the whole thing was handled. Food was amazing and we had a great experience."}
{"text":"From the greeting of the hostess out front to the friendly staff inside it was a great experience. I really wasn't expecting much as it was a very young crowd - both the staff and clientele - and it was rather busy for a Sunday eve after 8pm. They were great - every one of them. I had the Bombay Chicken curry dish and my hubby had the Shrimply something pasta. Both dishes were tasty and plentiful. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Busy spot on a Saturday night. Was going to be 30min wait or more for dining room so we found a table in the bar. Sat down and took a few minutes to get menus - server cane back shortly after to take drink orders. 20 min or more to get our drinks. Food order happened in between. Food came out and was delicious - nothing wrong there. Ordered a second beer and it never came - we were charged for it on our bill - shame on us for not checking before we left. 
Waitress asked if we wanted dessert - we said no thank you just the bill please. She brought us the dessert menu. 10min later we had to flag her down to bring the bill. 20 min later we flagged any waitress to bring us a machine she said she would grab our server. 
I realize it was a packed place but to be honest the service was very lacking. Either they need more people on staff - especially behind the bar when it takes over 20 min for a couple beers and a couple glasses of wine - or get staff that want to turn their tables faster. Server was not very fast with anything.
Good food. Bad service. Plus charged for an extra beer that didn't come 30min or so after ordering."}
{"text":"So sad to find out they got rid of the one really big meatball. It was one of my go-to picks on their menu. I guess I'll just stick to the nachos with chili or the Holy smoke burger with a poutine. 

I find the staff are always friendly but not always fast. While waiting I suggest reading the staff shirts. They have some pretty funny ones. They also got tons of tvs.

I also suggest jacking up your alcoholic drinks."}
{"text":"My go-to spot for a good girl talk with my best friend after a movies at STC. We went on Easter without a reservation, so they took down my phone number until a spot was available. I think it's a good idea so we could have walked around if we wanted, but they ended up calling us in within 10 minutes. The waiter was really friendly and walked us through some of the recommended menu items. Sometimes, they try to get you to pay the bill right after you finish because the waiters change shifts, but it's okay! Just pay first and they wouldn't mind you sitting there longer. Plus, they gave me refills of this hot water in a teapot with lemon which I really love.

We got the lobster and crab dip, and me and my friend both agreed it was one of the best appetizers ever. There was chunks of lobster and crab and we could really taste their flavours in the cream base. It came with tortilla chips and pita triangles (not as good once they cooled down and were kind of dry). For the entrees, we ordered the asiago chicken bowties and shrimply delicious pasta. The chicken bowties had the sun-dried tomatoes which I liked and the chicken was crispy as it should be. I thought that the shrimps in the shrimp pasta were a tad too small. 

Best part is I downloaded a coupon for $10 off as long as you sign up for e-mails on their website!~"}

{"text":"My brother-in-law chose this spot when we wanted to take them out for an early anniversary dinner. 
I hadn't been to a Jack Astors in a long time, as I don't know of one back in Winnipeg. My best memory was of the cheesy garlic pan bread, which was just as good as I remember! 
There were so many great options on the menu, and we were all happy with our food. I had the Hold the Beef veggie burger with a chickpea-lentil soup of the day. The soup was tasty but a bit smaller than I'd have liked, more of a lunch side than for supper. The burger was on a fast-food style sesame seed bun but the toppings had tomato bruschetta and goat cheese. I liked it a lot. My husband tried Korean BBQ chicken skewers with Caesar salad and sweet potato fries. My sister had Vodka N Soda Fish N Chips- a large portion of freshly battered and fried fish that was steaming as she cut into it. My brother in law had the Brie Burger which looked really good, with fries. 
For dessert we split an order of Fresh Donut Holes with 3 dips. It was a great dessert to share, we had fun with it.
Our waitress was helpful, describing some items for us and all other staff I encountered were friendly and helpful as well. The restaurant was busy but the dining area was separated from the sports bar area and we did not have to wait unreasonably long for our orders."}
{"text":"Went to jack astor's for valentines day. We were smart and arrived for 5pm early dinner.  The service was very good. The place was packed. I was not blown away by the food.

We tried the following:

Crab and Lobster Dip: This dish was very salty, the quantity of dip seemed a bit small and the seafood was sparse.  The dish seemed large, but it was not deep. We enjoyed eating the warm pitas served, but we ran out of dip, so I took home the left over nachos. Would not repeat this appetizer because it seemed very processed and not at all homemade. 

Buffalo Chicken Cobb Salad: We were sharing apps, so the waitress split the salad on to two plates for us, which was very nice.  There was too little bacon and blue cheese for my liking. The chicken was absolutely delicious. Celery seemed to be an odd choice to have in the salad. I did not like the dressing. I would not purchase this cobb salad again.

Brownie filled cookie with vanilla ice cream: The over sized cooked was served warm and the vanilla ice cream was delicious. I would order this again

Banana Split: This was marketed as a kid size, but it was massive, my whole family could have shared it.  

Rubbarb Cheesecake in a mason jar: I had high expectations for this dessert and did not love it. In fact, I thought it lacked a homemade quality. The cheesecake pieces were rectangular and seemed very processed, almost like it came out of a freezer.

Overall, I think Jack's might be a meat restaurant because the buffalo chicken ontop of the cobb salad was amazing, crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle.  My husband went to jack's last week and had the steak, he said it was comparable to the keg and he is a big red meat guy."}
{"text":"If you wanna watch hockey with audio don't come here .. There is no guarantee  that they will turn on the audio .. Also don't order their shrimp wrap unless you like \"raw rice\"... Wings are pretty good tho."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another try since I heard they brought back the iceberg beer.  What a disappointment.  Tasted horrible.  Ordered the deep fried broccoli.  AMAZING!  But 12 bux?  For broccoli?  C'mon!   Then got a burger.  Meh....  over all another let down.  I'll try again in another year and see if the prices match the lack of food quality."}
{"text":"Still clean and friendly.  Menu changed with jacked up prices.  Food is still average.  Not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"Came in after a late flight and Jack Astor's was one of the few places open. The patio at the front overlooking Bloor Street is cute and was packed with people. I had the fish and chips and the serving of fish was big. There is something about this place that was friendly and welcoming, especially since we were tired and hangry after a long flight. Bless."}
{"text":"Ok, certains vont trouver le marketing un peu abusé dans cet établissement, j'entends serveuses avec un corps de rêve avec mini jupe et débardeur venant prendre votre commande. Mais bon voyons ça comme du second degré car le service est vraiment bien. L'établissement se divise en 2 parties : le bar d'un côté avec la musique assez forte et des écrans partout et l'autre partie plus calme restaurant où je trouve qu'il est beaucoup plus agréable de s'y poser afin de manger un bon burger.

Au niveau de la carte : burgers, sandwichs, steack et entrée de toutes sortes.
Je vous conseille le bacon cheeseburger accompagné d'un bol de frites.
Il y a également un très grand choix de bières. (la red rickard vaut le détour).
Enfin détail marrant : on vous fournit des crayola pour dessiner sur la nappe en attendant votre commande.

PS: le coca est en refill (cad commandez un verre et on vous ressert à volonté)."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years for dinner.  Always had a great experience.  Except for this one time. Staff was too disorganized.  My daughter got the hamburger and asked for pickles and mustard. The waitress said that comes on the side.  No problem there. When her food arrived there were no pickles or mustard. So I asked the waitress if we could get it. It took a little bit. So my daughter is sitting there waiting to eat.  My partner ordered the bow tie pasta dish. The waitress said someone else is right behind me with the pepper and cheese. Well no one showed up. It was totally disorganized! We dont want to give up on you Jack Astors. We hope our experience is better next time! Or we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Pretty bad service for a popular chain- won't be back. 

Our waitress who had a \"do it your selfie\" shirt seemed to imply that service would be at a minimum anyways as she didn't even tell us her name, check up on us, and even swindled 1.5$ from me. 

I ordered their \"famous chicken fingers\" and they asked me if I wanted gravy on the side. So I said yes. It came on the bill as an additional 1.5 and I didn't want to feel cheap as she basically made it seem like it would come with it poured on top, instead of asking if I wanted it as an addition. Service was complete joke, and she didn't even say thank you as we paid. 

She had medium length brown hair and worked on the patio. I won't be back - joke of a service restaurant that's known to be popular in \"downtown North York\""}
{"text":"This location of jack Astor's is always a good choice to kick back with a few buddies. Its one of their newer locations, with the first floor comprising the bar and the 2nd as the dining room. The rooftop has a great patio which is always busy in the summer , and is one of the only decent patios in the north York area. In regards to the food, its decent but don't expect any revelations. The servers and bartenders have always proven to be friendly and quite accommodating everytime I visit. Come here if you want a laid back vibe to drink away your weekday woes."}
{"text":"Always a well-rounded spot for a couple of beers or decent food with friends just to chill, or catch the game. Pretty conveniently located and accessible to TTC too! No complaints here, doing a great job!"}
{"text":"Went to eat here twice while in Toronto.  It was just ok.  Not horrible, not great.  Service was just alright the first night, but was much better the second night.  Menu is large with a lot of options."}
{"text":"Well, if it is Canadian, order something Canadian. The chicken bowel I had was just not to my taste. My colleague had the chicken fingers, which looks pretty nice. Everything else looks fine. I'll come back for the chicken fingers next time!

Update:
Well, as I said I came back for the chicken fingers this time. I must say I made the right choice. They are just super tender and the sauce is just right! I had a few sour and hot sauce before but somehow they were just too much. This one is just on the right level for me. My wife loved it too so she traded the chicken in her salad with me for the chicken fingers......"}
{"text":"Went with my family (wife and 3 little girls) for my birthday dinner. My kids love the cheese bread so that's pretty much what they eat. Here's what we ordered and how the night went.
 -  couple orders of Cheese Bread
 - 1 order of Chicken quesadillas
 - 1 order of fried calamari

Got to the table, all four plates were dirty. Had to get borrow few plates from the next table (those were dirty too). Got new plate and placed our order (server was fine, no real issues). 

Got the pan bread in two cast iron pans. I've been eating this pan bread since the times they used to offer free bread with entre. The cast iron pans were cold to the touch (so not sure what happened there -- maybe they microwave the bread and use the pans to pretend they just came out of the oven.  Bread was fine as usual.

Got the calamari. My wife and kids were eating a piece or two then I look at and it was burned (not even over done, burned!). I tried a piece to make sure -- yikes. Got the waitress to re-do it. She says, \"not sure why that happened, they just put it on a timer\".  Got the second batch and most of those pieces were now underdone. Honestly, how do you go wrong when cooking with a timer. It was soggy and slimy. I told her casually that it was not right again.  She didn't do anything really. I should have talked to the manager because I ended up paying for the bill and I guess that's my fault.

Anyway, I'm pretty sure i'll never go back here on my own will.

Wish they would have covered the bill without me having to make a big stink about it.
Oh and they got hella expensive now. My fave dish was the Asiago chicken (about $14 then, now $19--no thanks)"}
{"text":"Ok ce JA est loin, STC c'est un peu la banlieue pour moi qui habite Bathurst mais si vous faites des courses au mall à côté c'est définitivement un endroit à tester. 
Le bar est immense avec un côté avec table classique, le bar central et un espace avec tables de billards de l'autre côté.
Restauration classique de pub, serveuses magnifiques fidèles à l'équation \"mecs + serveuses en mini jupe = je commande beaucoup de bières\"
Shout out au nachos qui sont juste délicieux.
Bref JA on aime bien!

Ok this JA is quite far for me as I live next to Bathurst station. But if you do happen to go shopping to the nearby mall this is a place to try.
The bar is huge with classic tables on one side, the circle shaped bar in the middle and finally more tables and 2 pool tables on the other side.
Here you'll have your regular bar food : burgers, nachos and so on.
Beautiful waitresses as usual following the JA equation \"guys + cute waitresses in mini skirts = a lot of beers ordered\"
Shout out to the nachos which are so damn good.
To make it short : JA me like!"}
{"text":"Love the location. Food & drinks are really really tasty, love it. The service was .. ok. I would go back for sure :)"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 10 yday night during st Paddy's and the wait wasn't very long at all which was great (2-5 mins, that's it!) 

The service was great the entire time. I got the chalupa tacos which are new on the featured menu. I got them with chicken. I didn't love them, they were good but nothing special."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 3.. Decent food, I had their Smiling Buddha Bowl with chicken, pecans, strawberries, apple and a whole lot more. The bowl was yummy but unfortunately the amount of vinaigrette was too much for the quantity of food and I had to stop at the bottom layer... I will probably order it again and ask for the vinaigrette on the side so I can enjoy it to the last bite. Wait time wasn't surprisingly long for a Monday evening. Our server was great but it seemed like they were understaffed based on the wait time for placing our order."}
{"text":"One of my usual hangouts on Friday or Saturday evening. The food is good, and an improvement from the decline it experienced between 2005 and 2010. This location is always absurdly busy, probably due to its location, making me and my friends attend the Queensway location instead to get a table. All that aside, 4 of 5."}
{"text":"Burgers, jolies serveuses, musique de pub et télés partout : que demande le peuple.
A conseiller : les sweet potato avec un bacon cheeseburger + une rickard's red."}
{"text":"Service was fast. Ordered salads, burger and chicken fingers-all tasty and nice presentation. Waiter never gave us the wifi password but there were lots of TVs to distract us."}
{"text":"New location and new menu items!! really liked the fajitas, they were delicious, and nice cold beer...so good. Staff were super friendly and reliable. Atmosphere is fun and lively. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Was there last night and had a pasta dish.  The tomato sauce is exquisite.  When I mentioned it to the waiter he told us it was made on site.
My appreciation to the chef."}
{"text":"For a chain they really do it right. I eat there once or twice a month usually at a booth in the bar. The servers are fast efficient and friendly and the food is consistently good; my only beef is they took a Greek Salad off the menu a few years ago and it was my favorite item.
Prices are in line with other chain restaurants  and they have a wide selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday Night! The place was really busy, loud music, but the food was Excellent! Had the Pulled Pork Burger with Sweet Potato Fries! Great Service! The Waitress was very friendly! Will come back again!"}
{"text":"I tend to always come to this Jacks since it's close by and a classic choice. The most recent time I went I tried the feisty bird chicken sandwich and it was DELISH! It comes in a hot dog bun, which I wasn't expecting but the sandwich itself is really great and worth a try if you want some chicken. It's the perfect blend between having their chicken fingers (which are also great) but in a sandwich form! 

You should also make sure you try the deep fried Nanaimo cheesecake rolls, those are 10/10 if you love cheesecake and Nanaimo bars like me! It's perfect!"}
{"text":"This was my first time back to a regular favourite of mine, since their renovation a few weeks ago.

This trip was definitely bitter-sweet. We ordered our usual quesadilla app, however not only was it smaller in size, there was no chicken in it. Odd, but ok, so then the mains come. I had an old favourite that was making its (sadly only seasonal) return - the Montreal Smoked Meat Poutine. It was great. My wife however got the Pad Thai and it was bland! I tried it myself and you couldn't taste nearly any park of it - even the chicken was flavourless. That's a first for Jack's.

The dessert however almost made up for it. We decided to share the new deep fried Nanaimo Cheesecake Rolls and they were great! 

The server was decent, he seemed like a newer person in the industry, but he faked it well enough. He also forgot to bring my beer - that's disappointing as well.

The new design is more open, modern and allows for more seating - which is great - but the parking is still an issue.

The place was very busy and for some reason the staff didn't seem their usual, friendly selves. The visit definitely felt rushed. 

Looking forward to visiting again, but overall it was one of the weaker experiences I've had here sadly."}
{"text":"We went for dinner again last night.  I had the jalapeno burger, which was awesome.  I had it last time I went and will probably get it next time, too.  I didn't find it spicy at all, but then again I do have a very high tolerance for heat.  Maybe I need to ask for extra, extra, extra jalapenos next time.  Their burgers have the perfect meat:bun ratio, and the hamburger is high quality and juicy.  I think the burger is even fresh, and not some frozen hockey puck.  The fries were also really good, although I kind of wish they would give you some kind of aioli or other dipping sauce as the Heinz ketchup degrades the otherwise awesome fry experience.

My dining partner has a different experience though.  She ordered some kind of chicken bowtie pasta thing, and wasn't a fan.  I tried some too and have to admidt that I would never order it.  It was coated in some kind of alfredo sauce, which was really dry and pasty as though it had been sitting for a long time and the water had evaporated or been absorbed by the pasta.  And to make things worse, the pasta looked and tasted exactly like something you would get in those Lipton Sidekicks pouches.  hehe.

The restaurant was PACKED last night (Thursday), which I thought was pretty amazing.  There was even a line at the door.  What really gets me though is that about 50% of the crowd consisted of families with LITTLE kids - I'm talking like 2-10.  It's strange since Jack Astor's is really a bar/club, and the waitresses are all running around in hot pants and skin tight shirts with their butt cheeks and boobs hanging out all over the place.  It's really an adult establishment and I find it weird when I'm drinking beers in a bar at 9 pm, the table next to me is celebrating a birthday for some 5-year-old kid.  in the lounge, at 9 pm.  not even kidding.  Seriously!?!?!??!   what ever happened to Chuck E. Cheese's?!??!?!?!?"}
{"text":"Your neighbourhood go-to place for a casual dining experience.  I love coming here and sitting at the bar to watch a sporting event (basketball or hockey).  If you ask them, they may even turn on the audio for that game!  They have lots of beer on tap and the servers are hit or miss, but overall decent.  Food is the same... I love getting their lettuce wrap :)"}
{"text":"I really like this Jack Astor's location. I live in the area, so I've had the chance to eat here several times. The service has always been great even when the restaurant was very busy. The chicken fingers here are great and as a lover of hot sauce, I love that they offer the sauced up version. Their veggie burger is pretty good too, although there is a lot of cheese on it so keep that in mind if you're watching your calorie intake. The pad Thai is also decent. It's obviously not as good as pad Thai from an authentic Thai restaurant, but still yummy. My only complaint is that it was not spicy enough for me and I wish they had given the option of choosing spicy or mild. The one thing on the menu I would definitely recommend is the bruschetta. I get it every time. I'm not sure what kind of sauce they use on it, but the mixture of the cheese and tomatoes with the sauce is pure heaven. It's usually fairly busy here, so be sure to make reservations or come during an off period if a crowded restaurant is not your thing."}
{"text":"I am glad this place started showing UFC. With hardly any place that offers half decent food or would have space to let you in, this place is a reasonable bet. Downtown is limited in options when you wanna watch UFC in HD! and have a reasonable beer selection and edible food. Tried it on Saturday for the Silva fight the place was packed but we got lucky and picked up a spot as someone was leaving. I ordered a steak with sweet potato fries and normal fries on the side. Friend just ordered the crab and lobster dip. I went for my backup brew of Stella. The steak was ok so were the fries. The dip was meh! especially at this price it needs to be what you call craby!  and lobstery :) 
Despite the place being packed the service was great with our server checking up on us regularly. I have pretty much given up on food at bars that show UFC but this is a reasonable option if you are in downtown and the bonus is no cover. Its hard to go wrong with a steak and they are OK for having a filler meal."}
{"text":"Just had a great meal at Jack Astors.  Atmosphere was fun and the wait staff and management so friendly and kind.  Big shout out to Thomas \"Pokemon belt\" (manager) and Chris (marvel comics belt) our waiter.  Both were so attentive and friendly.  Makes a big difference going to a restaurant and finding good staff who actually love their jobs !!!! Thank you for Making our Friday evening stress free"}
{"text":"I'm unimpressed by this particular Jack Astor's location at the moment. It's a go-to post-soccer victory (or tie...or loss...or whenever we feel like it haha) place to grab a beer and a snack for my team and it will probably stay this way, but I've had a couple iffy experiences with the food recently. Speaking of the food at Jack's, it has gotten surprisingly decent recently, but at this location the preparation isn't always on par. As an example the pulled pork poutine we ordered last time I went was topped with cold tuna-like pulled pork...stuff. Bleh, a little off putting. It can also take a little too long to get a table ready sometimes: the place looks half-empty, but it takes 10 minutes to get a table ready for us? 
Service is friendly and excellent, however, just be prepared for the possibility you may be sending a plate back or standing around a bit."}
{"text":"I remember this place being kind of a joke when I was younger (in terms of food...not just the name), but it's actually gotten really good in the last few years. It's always been a go to place for me to hang out with some friends after a soccer game, or to watch some hockey with some beer and poutine, but now the food is on par with the rest of the experience.
I was there today for a work lunch and ordered the Wake n' Bacon Club Sandwich. Coffee crusted bacon on an otherwise traditional club sandwich (save for the telera bun) was surprisingly awesome. The bacon was crispy and the coffee flavour was sweet and savoury. Interesting how such a small change can completely change a restaurant standard: it was delicious. It seems that a lot of the dishes are trying something a little extra with their flavours and ingredients.
Oh, also if you're just there for a beer and drinks: pulled pork poutine=awesomesauce."}
{"text":"If i could put 0 i would. Its not what it used to be. It was a family oriented resto now its a big noisy mess. The waitresses look inappropriately dressed and its inconsistent. 
Not worth the noise not only inside the whole place but outside as well. They are terrible neighbours blaring their music in every direction disturbing peoples homes. Our family and friends used to go here for over a decade till the reno and speakers and skanty servers. Not nice sadly...we used to like it there."}
{"text":"Last night I had the Mexican salad, the first and worst thing about this is that the chicken in it was RAW. I ended up pulling it out of my mouth when biting into it felt weird and pretty scared I swallowed some. So unacceptable. Secondly, they are called something like big bowl salads? This was not a big salad, they maybe filled half the bowl with lettuce, the toppings seemed to be thrown on sloppy and it was waaaaay over seasoned, the only tasty thing was the dressing. Not worth it for 17 dollars. Most likely will never go here again, I'm pretty disgusted every time I think about that chicken, I hope I don't get sick."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday evening. It took 10 minutes to seat us, another 10 to bring menus and another 15 to bring the waters which we asked for multiple times. 

Pure TOURIST TRAP with TERRIBLE SERVICE."}
{"text":"Year end parties make it crazy busy at restaurants. So I planned ahead and booked a reservations for our kindergarten celebration dinner tonight.  We were a group of 5 moms and 5 kids.  I ordered the cheeseburger and it was made perfectly- so yummy, can't go wrong with Jack Astors burgers.  The kids had the pizza, pasta, burger, or fish sticks combo meals. My kid devoured the fish! It was like a mini version of fish and chips but the fish was on a stick.  Pizza combo on the other hand did not look appetizing and it was clear on the one child's face when he decided he couldn't eat it!  Overall food and service were great.  Our waitress made sure we had everything we needed.  Even with the chaotic full restaurant, our waitress did a good job.  

However the WORST part of this night was the darn layout of the table!! We could immediately tell that it was placed in an area that doesn't have the capacity for sitting comfortably without getting bumped by passerbys.  And this was clearly the case when on NUMEROUS occasions we were asked to MOVE - literally get out of our seats so a waitstaff or guest could get by with a high chair, chair, wheelchair, stool, etc.  That is absolutely unacceptable.  If you don't have the proper space why set up the table there????  This made for a VERY disruptive meal.  When I asked the waitstaff why this table was set up so close to a busy area, she had nothing to say other than that I was right and that they actually stuck in an extra table that normally does not fit there.  So what's most alarming is that the staff at Jack Astors knowingly put an extra table that clearly does not fit in a super busy area.  AND purposely asked us to repeatedly get out of our seats as if WE were in the way and it was OUR job to move.  And the staff were not apologetic at all for every time hey asked us to get up.  Unacceptable!  Luckily our kids were kind and did as they were asked.  If this was a group of 10 adults...not sure you'd get the same response.   Thanks for almost ruining our evening.  I doubt I will return with a large group again."}
{"text":"This is the Jack's that I usually go to. I haven't had a problem with the service yet and I've been there countless of times over the years. I've probably been at least 10 times this year! I've  tried most things on the menu and the best things would probably be the steaks and any chicken...so crispy tenders, sauced up tenders, wings (especially the hot wings..delicious). The fajitas are also really good. Don't go for the pastas...they taste very bland. Not much too it but it's Jack's so I wouldn't really expect pasta to taste anything out of this world. The cookie brownie is my favorite dessert."}
{"text":"Une soirée resto-cinéma en vue, nous étions donc avec un horaire un peu serré. Un serveur nous a accueilli quelques minutes après notre arrivée, mais seulement pour venir nous souhaiter la bienvenue et nous écrire le nom de notre serveuse sur la table en ajoutant qu'elle viendrait s'occuper de nous très bientôt. 15 minutes après notre arrivée, personne n'est encore venu nous voir, pareil pour le couple à côté de nous qui, en plus, était arrivé avant nous.

Nous nous sommes levés et avons quitté. Je suis allé très souvent chez Jack Astor's pendant une période, mais ce sera très long avant que j'y retourne."}
{"text":"Though I'm really not a fan of the bar atmosphere and the extremely generic, chain-establishment food (that rarely changes), I must say, their barbecue chicken pizza is really good. I'm lactose intolerant, and get this without cheese, and it is still so, so good. I would really only ever go to Jack's for this pizza."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time in many years and thought we would give it another try.

We had the nachoes which were terrible. They had fake (velveeta-type) cheese and when we asked for beef topping: it came as chili like the canned Stagg type. We should have returned them after the first taste but didn't. Our mistake. My daughter ordered the sesame chicken rice bowl which was just ok. Mostly rice with a few pieces of deep fried chicken with a sesame sauce. 

Needless to say-next time we want to spend $50 for a meal-it won't be here."}
{"text":"If you're a tourist, on foot, and it's after 10pm and you're hungry for a meal, this place could work to satisfy your hunger.

We were exploring the Toronto area on foot and it was a little after 10pm.  This was the only place we encountered who's kitchen was still open.

Being from the U.S., we tried the Pulled Pork Poutine (classic poutine topped with pulled pork, bacon, green onions, pork rinds and chipotle mayo).  It was good and my  arteries were glad I was sharing it with someone but for $10, the amount of pork should've been a bit more than 3 nuggets worth.

We also ordered the Veg Out pizza.  It too was good but nothing that stands out and wants me to go back for more.

The waitress was nice, a little forgetful / distracted at times, received food a bit slow, and there were plenty of dead pixels on the wall-to-wall monitors.  Overall, it's a decent place if your food options are limited."}
{"text":"I used to have fish and chips regularly. The fish was excellent.
I went last night and it was a total disappointment.
Even though the breading was nice and crisp the inner flour was uncooked and presence of a lot of water.
Reason for that water could have been over-treated fish or the frozen fish was not defrosted and wiped properly."}
{"text":"On one of my last nights in Toronto, a couple of us decided to grab dinner at Jack Astor's. I'd never been to this location and to be perfectly honest, I'd only ever had one experience with a Jack Astor's restaurant.

This particular location is massive and I gotta say, the service was excellent. Our food was delicious (the best veggie burger I've had in a looooong time) and our server was cool in that she let us stay and hang out well after our meals were finished.

I liked the ambiance a lot and for whatever reason, they were playing the GREATEST old-school tracks! Everything from the Crows' 'Mr. Jones' to Def Leppard's 'Pour Some Sugar On Me'.

We had a great time and I really have no complaints. Good job you guys!"}
{"text":"This is the best Jack Actor's in town.The service is friendly and efficient, the food is always great. There is a good wine and at really reasonable cost. The specials are innovated and change regularly. They never rush you, unless you are in a hurry. I try to go there when ever we are downtown  , what an improvement on the Dundas tourist trap! Give this cozy place a try , you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Jack's is increasing their levels of customer service for various targeted clientele. Those who come for a quick lunch may be approached by the day manager and offered a stamp card to get their sixth lunch free, as well as the manager's business card. There is perhaps less individual attention in the evening during after-work drinks when the place may be packed, but the service is very good nonetheless.
I came here for the first time in a few years, and the menu had been revamped to include odd and delicious dishes, such as a nacho poutine and a beer-cheddar soup.
Reliable and cheap enough (especially for lunch). When you are with a big group and don't know where to go, there will be something for everyone on the menu."}
{"text":"I was near Union with friends, and we decided to stop here for dinner. Compared to all the other great options downtown, I'd say we made a mistake stopping here. The waitress took 30+ minutes just to bring out our water and then didn't even take our food order right away. Also for a salad that's almost $20, I'd expect larger portion sizes."}
{"text":"Jacks has really stepped up the menu over the years. Just had a Salmon that was awesome. Their burgers are always juicy and coked the way you want it. Anything you order is usually prepared to your satisfaction.  Cheyenne was our waitress, not only was she pretty gorgeous she was friendly and provided excellent service."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would. I just want a pitcher of water and they said they can't give me one....but no one has refilled water at our table even tho I've gone through 3 glasses from other people at my table. They only seem to care if you want to buy their drinks here. As a pregnant person, this really feels like they are discriminating against serving me."}
{"text":"This is an awesome restaurant. Usually busy but worth the wait. Great value for a family night out."}
{"text":"Poor me for believing that this would be a good place to catch a playoff game! Jack Astors appears to be a victim of the bigger-is-better approach to Toronto bar and grill type dining. There are TVs everywhere in the bar area, which is admittedly OK for watching sports, but it's LOUD - patron noise plus banging music plus TV sport-commentator sound that ends up barely being audible meant I had to positively yell at my dinner companions all night. It's too expensive and huge to be a pub, but too raucous and sleazy to be a restaurant. 

The menu is really huge and similarly unfocused, featuring the absolute chain-diner gamut of burgers, salads, fried stuff, wings and sandwiches, pizza, pastas, steaks, decidedly \"meh\" eastern-hemispheric dishes like Pad Thai and butter chicken (I had the Pad Thai, which was flat, bland and really only redeemed by a large dose of sriracha) - much like Janna S.'s review, I couldn't figure out what the restaurant was aiming for other than the broadest possible attempt to appeal to people who want their food to have a theme rather than a flavour.

And another thing: for such an oversaturated, underwhelming place, it's expensive! I paid forty dollars by the end of the night for my blah meal and two beers on tap (though these were decent - Sapporo, fresh and cold) when at other pubs around town I could have easily paid that much to cover meals and drinks for two people. 

I have absolutely no reasons to want to come back here, but if you're completely in need of a generic bar and grill meal (whatever the \"theme\") with no surprises whatsoever and provocatively dressed servers, Jack Astors' chain pedigree will make it happen in a flash."}

- Small portions 

Would not recommend"}
{"text":"I've had the pasta, jerk chicken, and club sandwich here. All pretty uneventful. 
I miss their garlic bread and warm apple pie. Do they still have this?"}
{"text":"This is my top choice anytime I go out for supper. I only get a burger & fries any restaurant I go to & jack asters serves the best bacon cheddar burger with BBQ sauce out there. I also recommend paying the extra 1.99 to swap regular fries for sweet potato fries. VERY friendly staff, have never ran into any rude workers ever at my experience here."}
{"text":"Love the chicken fajita and the Asian rice bowl. One of my favorite spots to watch the raptors play!!"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest Jack Astors fan, but I have to give this location props for being a fun bar to meet up at before a game or event. It's absolutely massive and has a great vibe. There's a pretty big patio outside as well, so lots of options here.

The service was excellent and helpful. My friend found a napkin on his salad (it was unused), and they comped his meal.

In terms of the food and beer list, it's no different than the other locations. We had a few of the pizzas and they were all a good size and were pretty tasty. Nothing amazing here, but the sauce they used was very decent and there was just the right amount of meat."}
{"text":"I have been back 3 times since, and it has improved. I think the initial visit was just a bad night. I have gotten their Nacho Plate twice, and at $13 it is not cheap but high quality and a huge portion! It tastes great and you have plenty leftover. There servers are always very good quality, and if you are a Gentleman, you appreciate the good service and their beauty."}
{"text":"It's  a Jacks..it is what it is. The poutines  are cool and the nachos  are huge. The bartenders are super friendly."}
{"text":"The food amazing,  the service incredible thanks Eden the person attending us.  The precise was just fine . I will be back with my wife again."}
{"text":"I want to like this place. I've tried a few dishes from here and it's just not special, no wow factor. I never hear anyone say, \"I'm craving Jack Astors.\" Their drinks are good and they have lots of TVs in the bar area. There's nothing there I can't get at any sports pub."}
{"text":"This place location is the nicest one I've been to. The bar area is huge and TVs are everywhere. It's not crowded either, you can walk through with ease.

The patio is nice as well and if you sit in the right spot, you can see the TVs inside! The service was pretty good, the glasses were kept full and the food was pretty quick as well. This was a Friday night, the parking lot was packed, but they were staffed to handle it!"}
{"text":"We had a large party and couldn't have been more happy with the service food and prices!
The food I would say is a solid 4. The pouting fries were amazing also the entrees were all well prepared and tasted great!!
The guac isn't so great...also the signature cocktails were a miss.
It was upscale bar food with great service and an amazing atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"... Is it just me or is this restaurant getting worse and worse...
 
I waited at the  empty front to get served to a table while  I watched 5 waitresses walk passed me without saying a word.

A little while after, I was seated to a table while waiting for a waitress to come and give us some menus.  As soon as she came over she disappeared for 15 minutes  and didn't come back until someone realized we were anxious to place our order. 

So... She took our order and carried off returning with the food soon after and never to be back until we were completely finished with our meal.

 once upon a time i remember people who worked here are attentive, polite and and had excellent customer service with good food.

Now, this is the a second time I came here this year. I am very disappointed with the food quality and presentation.

Food was almost close to awful. I ordered classic burger, golden calamari, chicken dippers, and the worst salad I have ever had."}
{"text":"I don't go out of my way to hit up Jack Astor's for lunch or dinner as it's more of a place to have a couple of beers with friends after work.  Since we had a meeting in the area, I decided to go with the crowd and have lunch at Jacks.

I must say they really did an overhaul on their menu.  The selection is pretty vast, and the different types of food and drinks you can order now rivals places like Moxies or Bier Markt.  I ordered the quesadillas and salad along with a couple pints of Guinness.  Food came out 0-100 real quick and the waitress was on top of things for the most part.

What blew me away was my food was actually well presented and tasted good.  Yes that's right, Jack Astor's you've turned yourself around from the previous slop drop food you used to offer!  I'd definitely come back again for a Leafs game if I'm nearby.  Jack Astor's you so crazy!"}
{"text":"I remember the old Jack Astors in Toronto.  The Scarborough town center one in particular.  I remember the food being horrible and trying everything on the menu and being disappointed.  Well it seems like all that is in the past now and theu revamped their restaurants and menu.  To be honest I've been here quite a bit in the last year.  The new menu and hockey season had me coming back.

Watching a leafs game here is not the greatest.  The TV's are small and the game is not usually aired with sound unless you sit closer to the bar.  The restaurant is also usually rammed with parties, families, you name it, going on.  It's better to watch the game as a side thing rather than come out of your way just for hockey.

The new food menu is good and they change it up every few months.  I still enjoy the fish and chips along with their burgers.  I feel the quality of the food is much improved from the old days.  I've tried the monthly specials including their poutine and pulled pork sandwiches.  They are decent, but nothing I haven't had a better version of somewhere else in the GTA.  Overall a good restaurant to eat at while the Leafs play."}
{"text":"Fun place for a group. Nice size menu. Have had the Cajun Mac and cheese, very good and would recommend. The chicken asiago salad is good, but the amount of chicken in the salad is small. Service was okay. Menu is a little pricey."}
{"text":"Jack Astor's is definitely more of a place to catch up with friends over drinks, as the food here is pretty average. Decided to share nachos with my friends and luckily, the kitchen was able to take our request of doing half nachos, half fries! (My friends idea, but not bad actually) The downside however, was that the toppings were literally just on the top so once you get past the top you're basically just eating plain nachos or fries. Didnt end up finishing our food because of this. 

The patio however is really open and has a decent view, would definitely recommend checking out when the weathers nice! Overall, the food is okay but I would come again for the rooftop patio, as the atmosphere was very fun and relaxing!"}
{"text":"I went to the Jack Astor's with my kid and my parents on Saturday night.  It was around 8pm and the place was packed (no surprises, last game of the regular season for Habs!).  Food is ok, but pretty much what you would expect from this kind of place.  The kid menu is very good and different from the traditional pasta/pizza/chicken nuggets kind of things.

The employees shirt messages are an experience in itself!"}
{"text":"I don't want to pay extra to have my drink \"Jacked up\".  I want my drink to be properly alcohol-doused without needed to state that I do.  

I don't want to pay $20 - yes, $20 - for nachos that don't even have meat on them, and that have a cream cheese-tasting fake cheese on top.  $3 for guac on the side. Not even good guac.

Server walks by with vacant expression and not ever checking in with us numerous times.

Bathrooms are repulsive.

The good: good patio, with a non-smoking section - this is huge for an uncovered patio.  Location handy for those coming on the subway or who work downtown."}
{"text":"Maybe its because they just opened. But the service was top notch! Food was fresh and delicious. Special shoutout to Sunny who over heard it was my birthday and got me a little dessert treat"}
{"text":"I would normally give places like this 4 stars but the service was so good I had to give it a 5. Great atmosphere with open concept. Lots of tvs and the menu is very unique for these types of restaurants."}
{"text":"Been coming to this location for awhile now since it opened. Pickering Town Centre really needed another restaurant in addition to East Side Marios. The one thing that sucks is that their bar is a lot smaller than the Scarborough location so getting a spot there is near impossible during weekends and special occasions. Their patio is heated and really nice in the summer. Pretty good eye candy here, too. The food taste the same as the Scarborough location. I'm very sad they no longer have the honey sauced up chicken fingers. Love their garlic cheese pan bread. So soft and melts in your mouth. Great spot to have a chill night with your friends"}
{"text":"SOLID 3.5 stars!

I like Jack Astors! It does feel like a sort of big chain establishment with very little personality, but something about it still hits home. Maybe its the fact that its right beside my work and there is NOTHING better than heading to their patio after work and uhh, hydrating? Maybe it's their drink 'Jacks gone wild' which I keep ordering every single time I am there? It is possibly one of the most aesthetically pleasing drinks I've seen.. the pretty pink liquid served in an adorable mason jar and tastes of sugar and raspberry syrup, and the whole thing just SCREAMS 'girly girl'.. and after a long-ass day of working with hoardes of men, that's exactly what you need. In fact, if I was a beverage, I think a 'Jacks Gone Wild' is what I would be. A sickly sweet girly drink served in an adorable unassuming mason jar that would deliver a roundhouse kick to your head if you got carried away and had one too many. 

This might as well have been solely a review of 'Jacks Gone Wild'. I can't comment on their food. I've had in once or twice, and its nothing memorable. The service is very good though!"}
{"text":"It's jack Astors. I go to color. This location has a great patio. Drinks are decent too. And the servers are all cute. Their food is too generic and flavorless. But their neighbour scaddabush isn't any better. You can get better food at Sqaure ones food court"}
{"text":"Love this place... the tofu fajitas are absolutely fantastic, I'd eat them everyday, if Jack Astors was closer. There plenty of other tasty options too, but the place gets very loud weekend evenings."}
{"text":"went here for night caps after our cruise.  I must say they were really attentive --- just drinks and shots and considering how busy the place was I was pretty impressed!"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch, so it wasn't busy. The service was great. We were seated quickly, drink and food order taken, drinks arrived and food wasn't far behind. 

My dad and I both ordered burgers with fries and they were pretty good. Fresh toppings and the fries were fantastic. Our coffee mugs were kept full with Starbucks coffee. Mmm.

Lots of TVs with various sporting events on. The bar was in the centre and the bartender was practicing tricks. Pretty cool!

All in all, a good visit. The food isn't special, but it's consistent!"}
{"text":"Great spot to catch the game and enjoy some good food!  Jacks is consistent with friendly service and quality food.  Chicken wings are my favourite,  smiling Buddha salad is also a great option if you are looking for something lighter... 

Great selection of beers on tap and ceasars are yummy too,  enjoy!"}
{"text":"After it became impossible to find a decent place in uptown to watch UFC. We ended up looking for a go to place in the suburbs. This one fits the bill the steaks here are OK and they have humongous multi-panel screen. Beer selection is limited so I ended up with Stella. I had the butter brushed sirloin steak with a side of sweet potato fries. Buddy had the New York. The Steak was grilled to our liking and the meat was good (at these prices we were not expecting miracles). There is no cover for UFC and this place does get packed. One of the better spots to watch UFC IMO as the audio/video setup is really nice. 
3.5 Stars for watching UFC."}
{"text":"Arrived Sunday afternoon at Toronto airport and went straight to Niagara falls.  Didnt get back to the hotel until almost midnight.  Used my trusty Yelp app and this place seemed like the only place open and still served food.  Decided to go and order take out.  Took forever for the bartender to take our order but was happy when she said it would only take 10 minutes.  45 minutes later the food finally came out.  Got the burger and poutine and was so not impressed. Burger was dry and fries were over cooked.  My co-worker  worker ordered chicken tacos but they were out. Got the beef instead and she said they were gross.  Funny though... throughout our trip, everyone said how awesome that place was... so not impressed! Will not be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is a good sports bar, they have solid beer options and poutine. I found the bartenders to be really nice and easy to make conversation with. If you're looking for a simple sports bar chain, this is a fine option."}
{"text":"It was actually terrible . My boyfriend and I usually love Jack astors but this time it was terrible and we probably won't be back at any location for a long time. Last time we went to Jack astors we ordered garlic bread and it was great, our server had told us that it's baked fresh on the hour. This time we ordered it, the center of the bread was frozen. It had been frozen lol . It obviously wasn't baked fresh.. lol.. he ordered a steak which was good but his vegetables we're hard. It wasn't a very good experience. Especially for the price my boyfriend paid, he wasn't impressed to say the least.."}
{"text":"Good enough food to bring friends out and have a good time. There are other pubs out there that serve similar food for better prices. However, Jack does a general good job in satisfying everyone at the table for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Like most people, I've been to Jack Astors several times but to this location for the first time. I went for lunch with a friend yesterday. My food was great, I had chicken tenders and Cesar salad and my friend had potato and leek soup with pan bread and a Cesar salad. She hated the soup and wasn't charged for her meal at all which was really nice of the server (Jenn) since we weren't expecting any sort of discount. Great service. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Good affordable beer!"}
{"text":"I was going to give 3 stars until I went to other restaurants and realized that this establishment just doesn't care.
My husband and I went on a Friday evening and we understood that it was going to be busy because a hockey game was on.  We got there and gave our name to the hostess and she said okay you can go in.... In where? We walked up to the second hostess station and we were ignored. Finally about 5 minutes later my husband went back up to the original person who took our name and questioned her and what we were supposed to do. She then said oh, I'll give you a pager, the wait is about 20 minutes.... Thanks for the help (She was too bust flirting and dancing around earlier to help us).
35 minutes later we were finally seated after an incredibly tight walk where we bumped into almost every table on the way. A waitress came up to us and quickly asked us if we wanted anything to drink. Almost 10 minutes later our drinks came which is crazy since my husband asked for water & i asked for a diet coke. The waitress then took our order. I have no idea what the waitresses name was because she never told it to us. 
My husband and i were boring... He ordered chicken fingers with fries & I ordered sauced up chicken fingers with medium buffalo sauce. After 20 minutes we got out food. The fries were soggy and nothing to rave about. My chicken strips were very good. i loved the sauce on them. I took a bite of my husbands chicken to taste it without the sauce and it was very dry and under seasoned.... Nothing amazing.
When eating my chicken it got a tad spicy so I went through my drink quickly. The next time the waitress made an appearance I asked for a water. Apparently someone was supposed to bring it out to me and no one did so the waitress stated she would get it... even that took about 5 minutes. When she finally got me my drink, my husband and I were done eating so we asked for the check.
Of course, it did not take long for them to take our money. The waitress did not get a good tip from us.
The restaurant is too busy worrying about getting people in that they do not care if they ignore costumers and the waitresses kept disappearing. If I am to ever come across another Jack Astors I will not be going in under any circumstances.  Ot just wasn't worth it to me."}
{"text":"I wasn't in the mood for anything greasy and ordered a tuna bowl (quinoa, avocado, other ingredients that I don't remember). It was fairly good albeit pricey, but that is to be expected with any food labelled healthy.

My main complaint was our server who handed us the bill the second she noticed that we were close to finishing eating. We were there much less than an hour including wait time for food, eating, etc. This seemed somewhat rude to me since she didn't even ask if we wanted deserts, drinks, etc. Granted, we were students and I guess she assumed that we wouldn't be spending a ton of money on drinks, deserts, etc. However, I personally will not be coming to this Jack Astor's in the future after my poor experience."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service just got an email from the manager apologizing and offering coupons A+"}
{"text":"Les cocktails sont bon, le service est rapide. J'ai été au moins 3 reprise et chaque fois c'était une bonne experience. L'ambiance est agréable, le rez-de-chaussée fait plus ambiance sportive. Le deuxième étage un peu plus intime. Je le recommande."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE.  My server was Steph V., and she was too busy talking to her co-workers than taking care of her only customer in her section on a Sunday afternoon for lunch."}
{"text":"Had gone to a few \"lounges\" earlier and started to get super hungry. Almost all the restaurants, bars, lounges had closed kitchen for the night so when my girl friends and I found this to be open we literally ran to it. 
Just like everywhere else in Canada, no different here, we were waited on by a super nice guy. Ordered some drinks, appetizers and had a nice chat with him regarding places to go to and things to see. 
Drinks were good, food was decent, service was amazing. Kitchen obviously open later than most."}
{"text":"Came here for supper this evening. Had the Board Nachos. Ordered sour cream on the side and didn't receive it. My friend also ordered them with no cilantro but still got cilantro on her nachos (she was told there was none on it when the waitress delivered them to the table). She also did not get the sides she ordered. The nachos are not filling so I had to order sweet potatoes fries with my order to get filled up. My friends had desserts which were delicious. I am. It sure why but as soon as the sun went down, we had bugs attacking us at our table including crawling up and down my hand before I killed it. Could see bugs flying in the lights. Pretty gross when they went in our food too. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This Jack Astor's is located near the North York Centre in a very heavy traffic area. We came here for a birthday celebration and as a group of 7, they sat us in the first floor near the bar. This restaurant is huge as it has two floors and a patio. They have big screens TVs on the first floor showing sports and music videos with music from the videos blasting through the restaurant. Washrooms are coed in the first floor meaning that it can only be used by one person only, male or female. 

However in terms of the food, this place is average at best. The menu is eclectic with different cuisines serving as inspiration but the execution of the dishes is lacking. I ordered the Bombay Chicken Curry Bowl while my wife ordered the Pad Thai Bowl with Grilled Chicken and Shrimp. The Chicken Curry was so bland that I had to ask for Tabasco sauce to \"spice it up\". The Naan was very good though. My wife's dish was better but could not compare to a Pad Thai from a Thai restaurant. With the competition in the area, I understand their rationale behind the menu but the execution needs work. Also the prices of the dishes are not cheap at all. 

Kudos to our server who was attentive but away from our table for extended stretches as she was the only one serving in the first floor. 

Not Recommended for the food."}
{"text":"Slow service. Loud and crowded. Limited menu compared to a few years ago. Not impressed..."}
{"text":"Chicken bowtie pasta is actually good! But I ordered the shrimp pasta dish! Did not get it and got this instead.

Service was not good and food was slow. No discount or apology for the bringing out the wrong stuff. Friends did not enjoy their food so I got lucky I guess."}
{"text":"Average Jack Astor's.

Not much to say here. I've been to this location a couple times after work as it is a 5 minute drive. The food was consistent with other locations, service was good, and the seating area was clean (we sat at the bar side of the restaurant)."}
{"text":"I came here the other night for an event and we had a good time. The restaurant sat our group of about 60 people in the front part of the restaurant. They had the doors open and a red carpet rope in front of the tables between the restaurant and the sidewalk. It made the space feel more glamorous and the open doors provided us with a nice fresh breeze as we chatted with new and old friends. 

The one thing I didn't like about this restaurant was the extremely slow service. For 60 people, we had one waitress who could not keep up. It's not her fault in any way, but the restaurant should have had more servers tending to our group. 

I ordered the sweet potato fries to munch on and was ecstatic to learn that they are truly gluten and dairy free. This put me into a state of food heaven  

All over, everyone had a really good time and I'll have to remember this restaurant can cater to really large groups of people if I ever need to plan a low key get together."}
{"text":"Food is not good. I am not sure why this place is popular. I ordered a meal that was chicken, rice and veggies, and it was all bland and flavourless, totally overpriced. Had some of my friend's fries, those are hard to screw up so they were fine. The service was good, nothing bad to say. Ambience is meh. Wouldn't come back. Only ended up coming here in the first place because Moxie's was closed."}
{"text":"Temple of the Douche.

I'm giving points here for the awesome service at the bar. We arrived late, like last call late, and the bartender automatically separated our cheques and was really prompt with service.

But the music was really bad, really douchey and really loud! I don't mid loud music if I'm out, but the giant organization of tv screens behind the bar feeding radiation and terrible videos was more than i could bear.

Every other person in the bar was wearing tight baseball cap (I am assuming to hold those few last brain cells)  a shirt with arms cut off at the shoulder and really enjoying the music.

If it wasn't cold and last call, we never would have come here."}
{"text":"Tried to come here around 6pm on a Friday but there weren't any seats at the bar so we went to the Loose Moose next door for a couple hours and then returned. We would have drank in the outside area at Jack Astor's but all of the tables available were cocktail tables (no chairs) and the bar didn't have any chairs either. Their beer selection isn't that great. The beer selection at Loose Moose is soooo much better. When we finished at The Loose Moose and returned to J.A. around 7:30p there was plenty of seating at the bar. So we had a couple beers each and then ordered food. I ordered the California Grilled Chicken Salad ($14.18) which was a marinated grilled fresh chicken breast and hothouse tomatoes, served on mixed greens with balsamic dressing.Topped with fresh basil, toasted pine nuts, beet curls and drizzled with a sweet balsamic glaze. It was a very tasty salad.

The bartenders were very friendly and attentive. My fiance and I made friends with a couple guys next to us that were enjoying a day trip to Toronto, away from their families. One of them quickly became known to us as Uncle Carl.

There were lots of TVs around, so it was easy to get a good view from any seat.

The bathrooms were located downstairs and well maintained. The restaurant overall was clean and the atmosphere I would consider sporty but that might be because we were sitting at the bar. This was a nice place to go, but I couldn't find anything special about it

I gave this 3 stars instead of 4 because The Loose Moose is 4 stars to me and Jack Astor's is not as good. I will return to Jack Astor's but I prefer The Loose Moose."}
{"text":"Service was average.. ordered steak and it was decent but pretty bland .. veggies under cooked a bit to my liking but beer soup was great as always. Not bad and may come again but just didn't overly impress me."}
{"text":"Fast service and friendly staff. The prices are good and the beer is big. Great pub food and an awesome location. Great view from the patio."}
{"text":"Patio is decent for some drinks and a bite ... Bit of people watching perhaps. Very casual place .... Good for after work drinks, I like the servers and bartenders they're cool as well. They burnt my pizza and comped me a new one no problem - good to see management fixing small issues."}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets 2 stars is because our waitress was a complete sweetheart. 
Now...
Interior: average, dark, we were seated at the last table by the kitchen so it was pretty loud
Food: I ordered the steak fajita bowl. When it came to the table it was cold, even the steak was cold. 
Price: Small bowl with some tomatoes and tortilla chips and some sliced up steak for $23... When I can make that at home for $8 this meal better taste AMAZING.
I ate it because I didn't have time to order again, and the manager was making his rounds to ask how everyone was doing but waited on us until we were almost done our meals! 
Will definitely not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"During my stay in Toronto I ate at this place 3 times. The first time I had the 3 cheese macaroni that left my head spinning! The second time I have the chili cheese nachos which hit every spot on the way down. On my last day in Toronto I had the BBQ Bacon Burger and I originally thought it would be too messy as depicted but it was mouthwatering. The garlic bread appetizer was good too! Absolutely love this place and can't wait to return! In the picture attached the Mac and cheese comes with more food, I just couldn't stop eating long enough in the beginning to take a full picture!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the Service was excellent. Our server Susan was very cooperative and made great recommendations. It was my son's birthday and she made the birthday very special. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I used to come here often many years ago with friends, and let me say that things have definitely changed (in a good way)! It's been renovated, and the bathrooms in particular are in pristine condition (might I say even Instagram-worthy)!

Came here on a Wednesday at 11:45 a.m. for lunch - despite it being the day after Boxing Day, both the mall and restaurant were surprisingly not crowded. When we entered the restaurant, we were seated almost immediately. Though, the place got very busy around 1:30 - 2:00 p.m.

MAIN: Chicken Tacos 

These were absolutely DELICIOUS! While the soft tortillas were on the oilier side, the pulled chicken was very moist, and the slightly spicy sauce really gave it a nice kick! The shredded purple cabbage also 'lightened' up the dish.

SERVICE: Amazing!

Danielle was our waitress and she was phenomenal! She always wore a smile when interacting with us, and was extremely proactive in filling up our waters, checking in on us, and even making friendly conversation!"}
{"text":"must be new owners or management my 2 co workers and I went here after worked wed night oct 4th my buddy ordered half liter of red wine the waitress said we got 5 ounce 10 ounce and 15 ounce servings and bottle we asked for biggest portion from a bottle cause their bottle prices way over priced for a pub bar. we told her that's not half liter was just over a glass I know from experience a glass is 5 to 6 ounces depending where u go and half liter u get 3 glasses . she said oh u just want half a liter I brought u a liter. we were like what? I looked on the menu it says 5 ounce 8 ounce and 10 ounce servings so she must be new asked the hostess is she new cause she doesn't even know what liter of wine looks like. they said she not new she just doesn't know her metric system lol we don't serve  in liters we serve in ounces 
now if your in service industry serving alcohol u would think u would know roughly what a liter of wine looks like. the waitress even said it is so a liter its 10 ounces lol. so like I said a glass is 6 so its just over a glass. now we had calamari we sent it back it was all batter no substance. I had chicken and steak fahitas now last year it was very hard to finish too much of everything, this time ordered half chicken half beef big mistake they literally gave me 2 strips of beef and 3 strips of chicken now for 4 flour tortillas that's not even 2 strips each ridiculous for 25 bucks, my  shredded cheddar cheese and lettuce the amount of lettuce I said was ridiculous to put on even more then one wrap and the manager said that's our normal amount we provide but we can get u more if u like we constantly get requests for more well hello wake up just give more than guess they are banking on hoping we take our chances nobody ask for more some people just don't stick up for themselves worrying they get food spit in I guess but the funny thing was the cheddar cheese way like 3 times more then the shredded lettuce which cost way more lol obviously people in kitchen must not know what they are doing which explains why the manager was camped out in the kitchen whole time. my other buddy ordered a cobb salad now heres where our experience gets really juicy. most cobb salads come with either ham or chicken. we were expecting for 20 dollar salad like half a chicken breast floating on top it states on menu comes with roasted chicken. we couldn't find a strand of chicken we called over a different server cause our fruitcake serving us was busy talking and laughing which seemed be bunch of her friends dining. he told us they changed the recipe used to be strips of chicken now its tiny bits of chicken mixed throughout we finally found a tiny piece size u would find from picking your teeth that's how small it was and he said so there is chicken so everything good now lol my buddy said what u mean everything good. again manager comes over now never seem this in my life normal manager would say so sorry lets take it off the bill or would u like us make u a new salad and ill make sure they put more chicken this time. what does she say I quote do u mind if I examine your salad? like what ? we were all in complete shock we said sure go ahead. she literally picked up my buddys salad with his fork and rummaged through it and said don't know what your talking about I see lots of chicken lol. we asked her can u just make a chicken breast charge us what ever surprising it was only 4 bucks if u only charge that why u so hymie in a 20 dollar salad unreal. my buddy beer was flat he sent it back got a different one again was made in 2 mins and our server was just talking and talking among her co workers my buddy joked first and said I should just get up and get it its 10 feet away. we figured she would be just another min nope another 10 mins no apology taking so long my buddy joked said I should tell her u took so long I don't want it craving gone lol. any way final straw was and again never seen this before he eating im eating he got full beer I got almost full glass of wine no would like anything else would u like see the dessert menu? she the manager approaches when we got all that in front of us says so you guys ready now for the bill or what lol;my buddy said she just wants us out so she can go back on her laptop play games do nothing . the way they conduct business is slimy even our nachos had a spoonful of salsa and sour cream enough to feed 10 people no common sense turned out u want more 1.50 each they know u gonna half to order more with amount of nachos they give its a money grabber just raise price on menu and do it right too cheap to change the menus I guess. we didn't get more not cause we are cheap just based on principal like how much could little salsa cost 50 cents tops and u got to nickel and dime your customers like come on u charge 9 bucks for a pint of beer. I will never be coming back my buddy said we should go tomorrow order 4 salads send them all back lol"}
{"text":"Very nice waitresses, very kind and quite fast in serving Food and drinks. Burger was ok. First wie want just some Beer, then we decided to change the table to eat. No problem at all. I will come back."}
{"text":"They are so friendly and you don't want to be 'nasty', so that's why I'm going with a 2 star instead of a 1.  A wonderful day to sit on the patio and I managed to snag a great table, even better when I got some coasters to stop the wobbling!
In short the service was not very good.  Extremely friendly, but just not good.  As an aside the folks around me spent a lot of time looking for their waitress so at least I had company :-(
I placed my drink order and that took forever to arrive.  I placed my food order and yet again another looooong wait.  The 10oz NY Strip with sides.  The steak was cooked to order but I would not use the word tender.  Okay flavour but chewy.  It was listed as coming with porcini mushrooms.  I counted 3 pieces buried under the pile of fried onions (which were okay).  I took a picture but sadly the contrast wasn't good enough.  Three pieces!  Yikes.
The mashed potatoes and veggies looked great and probably would have tasted even better if they were hot.  I waited about 15 minutes to tell my waitress but never saw her.  Gave up and ate some of the cold stuff.
On the good news side I told my waitress when she eventually reappeared.  The Manger came out and we had a nice chat and she offered me a dessert.
What a way to take away from what should have been a marvelous evening on the patio.  Highly unlikely to return."}
{"text":"This is a well-rounded establishment. A typical restaurant but a shinning example of what a good restaurant is. Everything about this place is fantastic, the only reason it doesn't get a five stars is because it's missing that \"je ne sais quoi\" that makes it jump into my mind when I'm looking for a place to eat in the area.

I've gone here a few times and the first thing I always notice is how gorgeous all the women working in there are. Like they must have some sexiness standard by which they hire their waitresses. But it seems that every time we ask for restaurant side we get a (flamboyant) male waiter rather than one of the sexy little waitresses who lured you in in the first place. Sigh.

The food here is awesome. The usual restaurant grub but they do it well. The dishes have been consistently well prepped among all my visits and the food has consistently been delicious no matter what I order.

The location is great, everything is well maintained and very well kept (CLEAN).

I will go back here when I have someone like my brother with me who refuses to try new things and just wants to eat at a good ol' North American style restaurant and I advise the same to you. This place is great for parties who have members who don't possess appreciation for diversity in taste."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite chain restaurants of all time. I try to get in here for lunch everytime I work in Toronto. I love their Chicken Pad Thai. It's so tasty for an american style chain restaurant. It's consistently clean and the service is always superb."}
{"text":"Typical American chain food. Been coming here for years. Nothing special. Don't expect to be wow'ed. Food quality is pretty decent. Sadly not huge america portions but filling enough.  Service ain't always great sadly but overall acceptable."}
{"text":"A classic angus burger was very hearty and tasty. They offer various sides like Caesar salad or fries.
The restaurant can be noisy when filled up as it is a family restaurant. Friendly staff. Quick service."}
{"text":"I like to stop here sometimes for my chicken pad thai. Both times I've stopped here however I've left with an upset stomach. I'm not sure if I just stop here at the wrong time of day or if it's something with how they store and prepare their food. My other problem with this place is that the service people all have a strange attitude that gives this joint an air of unwelcomingness. (Yah. I just made up a word. Suck it.)

But I will credit this place that it is where I originally discovered Jack Astor's delicious Pad Thai."}
{"text":"A co-worker took me there for a \"going away\" dinner since I'm moving. The service is okay. Nothing miraculous but we weren't ignored either. I had the Buttered Sirloin Steak done medium with Vegetables and Garlic Mash Potatoes. The steak was perfect! Had that nice stripe of pink through the middle without getting too rare or well done and the mash potatoes were delicious and cream. Only wished that they had given more vegetables with the dish."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night and was seated immediately. Sever was attentive. Food came in a timely matter. Food tasted good."}
{"text":"It was the winter.  We saw regular flies and fruit fly.  I don't want to see their kitchen.  Unacceptable!  Winter. What a build up!
That was my 1st and last time."}
{"text":"What a fun place. Great menu, lot of TVs. The wings are awesome. The wings arrive in a bowl (no sauce), they put the wing sauce on, pop on the bowl lid and shake until the wings are completely covered. What a great idea and fun to watch."}
{"text":"Classic example of corporate culture ruining a bar. Went here 2 nights in a row with friends. First night, 3 of us were seated by the hostess, only to have the waitress yell at us because \"these tables can only be seated by me...she is not allowed to put you here!!!!\" Service was good after that, although the rough opening made it tough. Second night, we had 3 tables on the patio watching the hockey game. Mid 2nd quarter, the TV switched to the Raptors game. We asked to have it put back since only hockey fans were out there, and were told it was company policy that all TVs had to be on Toronto sports. Literally 100 tvs, a place more than half empty, bc every single TV has to be on the Raptors  even if no one was watching it....  and they made 3 tables leave to go next door to the Loose Moose (which is freaking awesome always go here not Jack Astors...) bc of bizarre corporate rules. Anyway...3 stars for beer...-1 stars for management."}
{"text":"We actually left. The servers were nice to us but the music was way to load. Also not that impressed by the seemingly required short skirts."}
{"text":"Had a big team event here, the restaurant is very unorganized, two dishes completed missed, the food portion is tiny for the price, took forever to get our receipt plus many mistakes, never come back"}
{"text":"Had dinner with 2 of my girls and daughter today.  So nice to get together with them =)

So I made a reservation for 6pm as I know this place gets pretty busy on a Friday night and good thing I did, probably still would have been able to get a table at that time, but didn't want to risk the wait.  

Great customer service from when you walk into the door to the end of the dinner.  Also, the gentleman that took my reservation earlier was friendly and polite throughout the call as well.  Our server Derek was very friendly and attentive to us the entire night!  Great job Jack Astors on having great people working for you.  It was also nice to see them kind of have a team meeting/pep talk right before the rush started, which shows a lot of team spirit in their environment.

Now the food...it was good, just good...nothing amazing, but good lol.  I got the Korean BBQ wings with side order of fries, the fries were cooked nicely and my wings were a good size, but could have used a bit more sauce on them.  My daughter had chicken bites with fries and it was a good portion, easy to eat for her.  My friends got sauced chicken fingers and chicken burger, didn't get to ask them how their food was.  The crab dip was good...next time I'd just ask for it with the chips cuz it tastes so much better lol.  I had an alcoholic cocktail called beached which was good, only downfall...not enough lol, needs to be in a bigger glass lol.

All and all...a good night with the ladies with great customer service."}
{"text":"I have a real problem paying $9 for a pint, really 9 bucks?  I only like this place because it's a meeting spot for a group of friends I only see once a month or so.  We've been coming here for years and the staff has always been great.  Food prices aren't so bad and their burger's, nowadays, are actually amazing.  I realize, I go to this place as well, but I don't get the popularity of this corporation.  I get it for Scarborough, because really there's not a lot of other places to go, but any Jack's I've been to is always rammed and I just don't get it.  The drink's are way overpriced and there just isn't anything great about it.  Yet we still go here."}
{"text":"Great place for watch playoff games... always a good time... I have had a mix experience here"}
{"text":"Service was slow, food wasn't great, but it was ok. Be careful with their beer upsize policy. They give you a larger beer without telling you then charge you $1.29 extra and it's not mentioned anywhere on the menu! The waitress said its our policy. I asked her for the manager, she came back with a revised bill. Won't be going there no more"}
{"text":"Nice bar area and great screens for watching the game.

The staff were nice and accommodating and put one of the NHL playoff games up on the big screen for us. The other huge screen had the Jays game on.

There were nine options on the kids menu, but the nachos and pint selection are pretty standard."}
{"text":"Really nice people, and amazing food like the garlic bread and the Cobb salad wrap. If you ever just want some spectacular food come here or if you like nice people."}
{"text":"Back again yesterday. :) 

So happy that it's finally acceptable patio weather! Got here and was told there was a wait for the patio - no biggie. Sat at the bar with a beeper thingy and ordered some food and drinks. Beeper went off, went outside. 

Got myself a 'Beached' cocktail... And my taste buds sang! Might be my new signature drink! Think it was white rum, blue curaçao and pineapple juice. Had me two of those. :) 

Food wise, I decided to do something different other than my regular nacho order and went with the bacon chicken club with fries. Other than the bacon being a bit too well done, it was pretty decent but the star of the show was actually the fries! :) 

Hilarious point - one of the waiters fully tripped and spilled beer all over me in my seat. I didn't care, shit happens. Half the staff continued to apologize profusely (unnecessary but appreciated nonetheless) and the manager (I assume) came over and comped our round of drinks."}
{"text":"So this is an updated review for this location as I originally reviewed it before.  I had to give them 5 stars today due to their great customer service that I had experienced today even on a busy night.

Jon was my server today, friendly and just a great server.  There was an error on my order, it was quickly taken away and made again correctly.  No biggie on my end, things happen...but near the end of our meal, a manager came over and apologized for the mistake and said coffee/tea or dessert was on the house as Jon informed him of the mistake he made.  This is an example of how good customer service can turn anything around.  I was never upset that my order was wrong so I was not expecting anything.  I'm very BIG on customer service just as much as good food.  Keep it up Jon!! 

Our food was great as well, we finished off pretty much everything.  

This location overall based on experience has been great on their customer service and good food for a food chain in my experience."}
{"text":"Generally not a big fan of sports bars and chain restaurants, but every once in a while I am pleasantly surprised. This was not one of those times.
Stopped by for a late lunch and ordered the bacon cheeseburger. Kudos for having a gluten free bun option. The patty wasn't bad, but the cheese wasn't melted at all, in fact it was still cold, and the bun wasn't toasted on the inside, it was burnt black. The fries were decent but the portion size was miniscule. Really, are people still doing that low carb diet thing?
I was driving, so I didn't order booze, and that was the kiss of death for service. Once I explained I couldn't drink, I only saw my server twice - to place my order and then when she delivered the food. I had to actually walk around to find her chatting at the bar to get my bill.
A total lack of caring about the food they were slopping out, and about anyone they perceive will not tip enough.
Next time I'll get a better burger faster and cheaper at Angus Burger."}
{"text":"For the few times I have been there, this time was no exception to the great service we received. Sadly the server didn't think the peppers on the burger I ordered were hot peppers but my tongue disagreed!! ha!! I picked them off and enjoyed the rest of the burger.

My friend enjoyed the California salad. We were in and out as we were headed to the Raptors game. 

Busy place on New Year's day!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for great service and good food try ANY other Jack Astor's than Yonge and Dundas. 
Over priced food, slutty female staff and poor customer service!!

Any other Jack's would be fine but this location really let me down"}
{"text":"I really hated this bar. I have no clue what the food is like, nor do I care to find out, because they couldn't even get the bar part right. This place had the fortune, or misfortune depending on your view, of being just across the street from the hotel my firm was having a conference in. As a result it was bombarded nightly by a varying cast of people with expense accounts to blow, usually in search of cheap, crappy beer (ughh, no thanks). Jack Astor's was happy to oblige them on the crappy end, but not so much in the cheap department.

The selection here is what you would expect at Applebees or Chilis, and I'm guessing this is some equivalent of those places by the food menu. The problem is the service is drastically slower, even on the nights when we didn't flood the tables, and the beer is so overpriced you end up spending $10 a pint by the time all the taxes and tip are included. If they were pouring Samuel Smith or Rogue premiums from the taps I might be inclined to pay, but for Molson and Labatt I just don't think it's justified.

They do have a really nice outdoor patio with space heaters at nearly every table, which accounts for one of the stars I gave them. The other comes from simply putting up with our insane group who decided to completely take over the place on one specific night, pouring in about 200-300 people at one time. They made a shitload of profit in the process, so I'm sure it was no sweat off their backs, but points to anyone who deals with a surge of that magnitude."}
{"text":"Had the Thai noodle dish with chicken and it was one of the blandest things I've eaten in years. Service was spotty as they seemed to forget about us a few times even though it wasn't busy and they had plenty of staff.

Decor is nice and the place is clean though, but not really somewhere I'd want to make a return visit to."}
{"text":"Do you like mediocre food that's overpriced? If yes, go to Jack Astor's."}
{"text":"I headed over to the location at Shops at Don Mills to take my interns out for a goodbye luncheon. There were 7 of us that day and we were seated at a rather cramped table that was maybe only meant to comfortably seat 6. I didn't complain too much though because I prefer round tables over rectangles, so not a huge deal.

First off, service was amazing. Food, on the other hand, was meh, but the service definitely made up for it. We decided to start out with the spinach artichoke dip. Now, this is probably one of the only things that I get from Jack's when I'm sober because it's actually good, so I was pretty excited when we ordered this. I was pretty much drooling as I was waiting for the dip to come out, only to be gravely disappointed at the quality of it. I get this at least once every 2 months, either from the Yonge and Dundas location, Yonge and Bloor location, or Scarborough Town Center location. Not once has the dip been watery like soup, but for some reason, it was at Shops at Don Mills. God, it was horrendous. I didn't even bother eating it, so I just sent it back. Even my broke interns didn't want to eat it lol. No more than 2 mins later, the manager came by and said \"Congratulations! You're the guinea pig table for our spinach artichoke soup. We hope you liked it!\" I thought he was being serious for a second, until he sincerely apologized for the quality of the dip. He then took it off the bill immediately. 

Next, we all got our entrees. Again. I try not to eat at Jack's unless I'm looking to get day drunk on their mixed drinks because the food isn't that great unless your senses are compromised. I got the sauced up chicken fingers .The sauce is way too oily, but the fries were good. Then again, I was on a clean-eating binge for a week, so anything fried, salty, and oily tasted great. One of my interns ordered a pasta that was a little too dry for her liking, so she sent it back and the manager promptly apologized again. 

At the end of our meal, platefuls of surprise brownies were served for the inconvenience that we experienced that day. Although the food wasn't great, the service was amazing and I'll def be back to bring my next batch of interns for their goodbye luncheon. Thanks Jack's! If I remembered the manager's name, I would've posted it here, but I don't. Great guy though."}
{"text":"My preferred Jack Astors in Toronto. Great servers and food. My preferred drink is the Blue Raspberry lemonade.  Excellent poutine and excellent sauced up chicken fingers. Cheesy garlic bread is always great. So is the spinach artichoke dip. Really just a great place."}
{"text":"Went there last week.
I used to love this location. But this time I went was absolutely terrible. Crappy server, took forever to get our food and drinks. Took forever to get our order taken in the first place. The my boyfriend's pint came and it had a HUGE CRACK down the glass. 
Food is always good, but it's just not worth it if it takes 2 hours to get my meal and eat it, and then another 15 minutes to get our check."}
{"text":"I'm here with a team of 39 staff from work and we're all assembled on the enclosed patio with garage window doors.

We got advanced notice of an automatic 15% gratuity added to our separate bills.

While being served drinks, my friend next to me ended up with a beer and a glass of water accidentally spilled onto his whole back by our table server.  ALERT!  The next action was 5 stars... he got a free Jack Astor's t-shirt so that he could change into and enjoy his meal, which was also on the house!

I ordered The Classic Burger made from a double-stacked 7oz juicy Ontario Angus ground beef $14.99 with Market-Fresh Vegetables as my side.

All around it was good food and service given the size of our group."}
{"text":"I was too late to take advantage of the tap specials before 5pm and too early for the after 9pm discounts.  The pre-reservation occasion was a work social with 10 friends and staff seated us on the second floor.  Group service charge/tip of 18% automatically added to each person's bill.

I chose a $10.30 Goose Island IPA from Goose Island Brewhouse Toronto.  Excellent body and flavour!

We are munching on Ye Olde Faithful Macho Nachos $16.76 loaded with tomatoes, peppers, onions, jalapeños, and three cheeses.

My dinner was The Italian Burger $17.22 made with Angus beef and Goat cheese, onions, tomatoes, garlic, arugula, balsamic drizzle and garlic aioli.  Pair this with fries.

Great service!  Food was okay."}
{"text":"it doesn't surprise me that reviews for this place are a consistent 3 stars.  they definitely don't do anything wrong, and they definitely don't do anything amazing or unique- it's the bane of being a chain- you have to be amazing to relax the fact that you're a stamp amongst many.

that being said, it's actually quite a nice sports bar with very nice wait staff.
It was 10pm and I was searching for a place that played the Canucks game (hard to find, I soon found out, in Toronto).  After trying the Irish Embassy (which gave me a bitchy and unimpressed \"no\") I found myself at Jack Astors.  I told the hostess i was looking for the hockey game and she was lovely enough to check if it was on, or see if she could change a channel for us.  
ta-da!  done and done.
i'm there, watching a game with a cold beer in hand and everything came out peachy.

Reliable and nice, this place.  I would go again for a \"reliable\" above average night again."}
{"text":"Desperate for a quick and tasty meal after a long day and turned to Yelp for help finding an option in Markham while in town for a quick overnight.  While there were numerous options, I recognized the Jack Astor name and remembered the friendly bar tendered from a past trip to Vancouver.  So despite multiple options represented in Yelp, all with sold reviews, I went with the known entity. 

The facility itself was especially inviting, especially with the beautiful weather and outside seating area.  I did pass on outside seating as offered by the hostess as I wanted to sit at the bar.  It's a table for one thing for me. 

The bartender was on his game and after sitting down for no more than 2 minutes, the bar keep was in front of me to take my drink order.  The bartender asked if I wanted the small pint or the large pint. Really?   Isn't a pint a pint?   I requested small pint and surprisingly, the beer was served in glass larger than the rest of the pints patrons were drinking.  

When I had questions about menu selection, the bar keep was happy to provide advice.  I selected the seared Tuna bowl which features rice, a few veggies and I was told Quinoa.  I was also told the bowl was a big serving.  I was starving.  While it flavor was very good, I was disappointed with the portion size as a dinner portion and the rice didn't seem fresh.  

I would have rated the experience four if the portion sizes were adequately described. Plus, never during the course of the meal did the bartender ask how things were.  He did when he presented the bill at the end.  

Jack Astor's is still ok in my book for a fast casual chain meal, but I couldn't recommend Astor's as a dining experience or capable of providing \"memorable food\". In hindsight, I should have gone with one of the many independently owned Asian restaurants in the area.  The day after my dinner, my customer told me Markham has a large Asian population, which for me is a bonus.  Next time I'll go with the local cuisine."}
{"text":"The food was good but inside is loud as is typical for a bar and grill establishment."}
{"text":"I feel almost awkward award Jack's a really good review as I had relatively little positive things to say about the chain for a few years. But ultimately, things can change, and you just have to be honest and give credit to where it's due.

As I mentioned in my review of one of their locations in Oakville, they've clearly stepped up their game in more recent history. We had out-of-town guests who also had kids with them. As much as I would've liked to find a more unique place to eat when in the city, you just have to be practical when there are 5 kids between the ages of 3 and 10. Fortunately, I knew that aside from being practical, we'd all still find something we'd enjoy.

They really do a terrific job of serving fresh food. They don't even take shortcuts on the kids' dishes as things like chicken fingers are made in-house. I'm falling in love with their tuna sandwich which is made from a perfectly seared tuna steak and a very generous serving of avocado. My wife got their wings, which were great and tossed right at the table.

My friends had never been before and loved the Cobb salad and soup, as well as the fact that their kids really enjoyed their meal. They had a great impression overall.

There was even a magician who went around to all the tables that had kids. If you don't have kids, this may understandably sound cheesy or unnecessary; but if you're in my shoes, it was great to see the kids entertained and thrilled at all the tricks - for free no less.

I felt that the waitresses sexed-up image was a bit OTT compared to other locations I've been to, and the fact that they're still clearly trying to appeal to families as well. In fact, most servers in other bars in the city (read: not family friendly) don't seem the feel the need to put out the vibe to the extent that they do here. With that said, our server was very friendly and geared her approach appropriately for our table.

Jacks is on a role, and the expression \"Jack of all trades...\" fits as there's something here for everyone, which they pull it off quite well."}
{"text":"Of all the fast casual restaurants out there I enjoy the value you get at Jacks. 

They've upped their beer game with a decent selection of craft beers, including IPAs, saison, Belgian wit and more. They do rotate the craft taps, so you'll always find something new to try. 

The food is decent, fair value for a place like this. I've enjoyed their tacos, wings and burgers, but my go to is the chicken, goat cheese sandwich with sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Excellent place for enjoy good food, good music and good service! I was there las night and I'll go again in a few days!"}
{"text":"This used to be my hood and sadly... and quite strangely, for the most important intersection in our fair city, this area is seriously lacking some good R&R locales. There are some alright restaurants but no great chillout locations like you would find on Queen or King Streets. 

Burgundy's and The Pilot are more like simple, old fashion bars, good places to go with your buddies but not a date or to just relax with someone. The Spotted Dick is a horrible dive that should be better specially due to its location and Peridot has great potential if it was not to the fact they are money hungry and will \"stop\" serving pints of beer after 10:00pm in order to get a few more bucks out of you. 

Jack Astor's has a more modern look to it, and tries but ultimately sort of fails...But  why do you ask? It is kind of small, which is understandable due to the fact that it was carved out of a corner of a business building and space is limited. More importantly the food is alright but definitely nothing special. 

There are what I could call 'way too many TVs' for such a small place and it can get a bit loud regardless of where you sit. Again, beggars can't be choosers so a lot of people come here out of desperation so it can get crowded... Specially by office drones from sector 7G (let's see who gets that one) and from the Bell and CIBC buildings nearby. 

About the best thing this bar has is it's patio which of course has limited space and a limited season. However if you can a table during the Summer and a few cold ones then it is not too bad and a decent spot for people watching. Still though, the food? Meh.

In the end, Jack Astor's is ultimately bland and inoffensive (read: mainstream accessible) hence there are so many in the suburbs and this hoods needs it. 

As I said, beggars can't be choosers."}
{"text":"UFC!! Apps, drinks and friends makes for a great night! We ordered the wings, calamari, chicken spring rolls and lobster and crab dip. Add some drinks and some men fighting with great company makes for an entertaining night.

At the end of the night one friend ordered wings to go and we found out they had been sitting at the bar for 45 mins. Fresh batch made and wings were comp'd. Good customer service."}
{"text":"Went there for drinks with a friend on a Thursday evening. Our waiter Joe took quite a while to come and introduce himself but as we were chatting we didn't mind. We ordered a glass of wine and a craft beer with Nachos to nibble on. The nachos were disappointing with a skimpy amount of topping for the volume of chips. Joe came to check on us a few time while we were there, but Once we were ready to leave it seemed to take our wait staff a long time to get back to us with the bill."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Service not the best, prime location. My first time here and there was so many great entree selections. I definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"...great place for drinks and apps and above average bar-type food.  staff is friendly, food comes promptly, opens late every night. 

we ordered calamari as an app and as always, it was great. as a main, i ordered the top sirloin steak, medium rare, with mashed potatoes and sweet potato fries. steak was good, cooked just the way I liked it. mashed potatoes were good, but I'm not a fan of green onions and there were a bunch of it mixed in. sweet potato fries were awesome, definitely worth the extra add on cost. 

3star rating is because of the price. for these prices I can get a higher quality of food than just above average bar-type food."}
{"text":"Yet another visit to Jack Astor's. I describe the entire chain as consistently disappointing. I would also call it overpriced pub food.

Maybe that's unfair. There is one dish which I actually enjoy -- the Chicken Foccacia Sandwich. But beyond that I always find the food is just meh, especially considering how much you're paying. 

I ordered the Steak Sandwich tonight, and was again disappointed. The piece of steak was surprisingly small (maybe the size of my palm), and significant parts of it were just fat. The bun that it was sitting on top of looked dead and flat and totally unappetizing. On top of the steak they put this sort of mushroom gravy stuff which I flat-out didn't like. It tasted like it'd come out of a can and ruined the piece of meat. The fries were good, but it's hard to screw up on fries! For $14.98 I'd expect better. I've had some great steak sandwiches within this price range."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant 0 stars if I could. We got our table right away with an empty restaurant. After sitting at our table for a LONG 20 minutes, I got up to ask the hostess where our server was. Another 10 minutes later, the server comes over to get our order and we order our food and drinks at once. AN HOUR LATER, I get up to ask the hostess where our server has been and to send over the manager. Finally after being seated for 1 hr and 20 minutes, we receive our food and it's ALL COLD! So our server stops by for the second time since we've been here and we tell her and she has to grab the manager again. We just decided not to eat our cold food after our shitty service and left. TOTALLY DISRESPECTFUL! And it was a slow restaurant. Wtf?! Never coming back."}
{"text":"Worst service, food and drink. Over priced. Food was cold. We didn't even get plates or cutlery without asking."}
{"text":"Just moved to Toronto from NYC and live in the neighborhood. Went here a bunch of times as I didn't have tv and knew of nowhere else. Food is mediocre. Ambience ok. Service is terrible unless you sit at the bar.  Bar staff are actually the place's only saving grace.

The kicker? Game 3 of the Stanley Cup. Had to ask them to turn on the game.  Refused to turn on the sound.  I quite literally laughed out loud at this.  Thought I moved to a place where hockey was a thing.  Their response? \"Corporate won't let us turn on sound unless the Leafs are in the cup\".  Riiiight. Don't hold your breath on that.  What a joke.  Blatant lie, obviously as they clearly had not made any such request of \"corporate\" and we're just using the first excuse that came to their head.  Intrigued, an email with the corporate office confirmed no such conversation or policy.  In fact, the corporate representative called the situation and response \"ludicrous\".

Joke of a place.  Won't be back.  Nothing to do with the Rangers losing, promise :)."}
{"text":"This location is usually a complete hit or a complete miss. I've come to this location for years and sometimes I have a really great experience and sometimes just a plain waste of my time and money. My advice is to not come even 2 hours before closing because the servers and kitchen staff slack off. My most recent experience, I went to order nachos and compared to the last time I ordered the same nachos (which was a week before) it was complete waste of money. How do you not put jalapeños on nachos that clearly states come with the nachos on your menu? Just a small example of what I mean when I say they don't care after a certain time. They also need to improve on their service, even when the restaurant isn't too busy it's still slow service."}
{"text":"This is a really convenient location.  I'm not usually a fan of going to chain restaurants downtown.  Really, what is the point?  But once in a while, I have a craving to get some traditional, suburban fare.  

Pros
-they are open way late, even on Sunday
-they're in a good location
-they make cherry and vanilla coke.  SO GOOD.
-they still make their disgustingly delicious garlic cheese bread *drool*
-they have a good selection of beer

Cons
-the service is slow
-the menus at all Jack Astor's are hard to read
-the food is nothing to write home about

I had the buffalo chicken fingers and they are so good.  Once in a while when you want to be full, you want predictable food, and want to go out at all hours for food, this is a good place.  If you want fancy food or food that is unique, this is not the place for you.  You should go into eating here knowing what you're getting in advance, then you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice place to sit outside, but the food is pretty terrible. The Pad Thai is overcooked and with a rather strange sauce that has no connection to Thailand whatsoever; the big chicken salad was bland and with a strange aftertaste. And we had to send a drink back since the glass still had copious amounts of lipstick on it. Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"A buddy and I were in town for an event and while out walking looking for dinner stumbled across Jack Astor's, figured why not as it's a chain restaurant and you can't go wrong

We were seated quickly and our friendly waitress came over in short time ( I did notice that they have some VERY attractive waitresses )

We ordered the Korean BBQ chicken fingers and they were pretty damn tasty, however my order of the Chicken Curry bowl was a little bland

Not bad as far as chain food goes, nothing special."}
{"text":"The red wine sangria is to DIE for! So delicious! I'd return for that alone. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Jack's is just a great place for groups to have a good time.
Food was good, nothing exceptional but the drinks and atmosphere make it worth the time and money!"}
{"text":"I've gone to the Front Street location a few times and I always get the same great service & great food.  I usually sit at the bar at lunch & usually my server is Amanda.  She is always attentive, remembers my preferences, and always polite.  A beautiful young blonde with GREAT assets guys.  You'd have difficulty finding any girls who aren't HOT."}
{"text":"Dined here with a group of about 16 people.  With a reservation, we were accommodated quite efficiently.  Both our servers were very attentive, although they SHOULD be given that the 15% gratuity was automatically added to our bill!  Still, good service is not to be taken for granted these days and both servers were always very available, cheery and timely, even bringing refills for our soft drinks without even being prompted!  Appetizers and entrees were brought out in a reasonable time.  Quite an achievement as it was a typically busy Saturday night and the restaurant was jam-packed.  

Only complaint is that being a large and reputable chain, Jack Astor's SHOULD really take the initiative to offer much healthier fare.  I know that restaurants are not exactly conducive to sensible eating and are probably the wrong venue fir this expectation but as a health-conscious person who hates to derail her diet and lifestyle just because of dining out, I had checked the nutrition info prior to dining and had an insanely and frustratingly difficult time finding a healthy entree!  I am appalled that salads are ~500-600 calories, pastas/steaks are ~900-1200 calories and burgers/sandwiches are ~800-1000 calories!  This is disregarding the 3000 calories poutines!  Even entrees on the kids menu ranged from 500-800 calories!  Jack Astor's is in a great position to lead by example so I would really like to see more healthier offerings or at the very least a menu section that highlights food for health-conscious patrons with a calorie disclosure.  I have seen various forms of this in other restaurant chains so it is not asking the impossible.  In fact, that would definitely increase your business! 

Other than that, it was a great first time dining at this location.  Underground parking at the nearby Empress was a $5 flat fee...thank goodness!  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Dined at this franchise location for the first time this past weekend for a family dinner.  We were thoroughly impressed!  Great menu selection that appeals to all tastes (I am a health-conscious person who's indecisive so that's saying a lot!); fun ambiance with the usual quirky Jack Astor's humour and multiple TV screens broadcasting sports and shows; very prompt and attentive service (our server frequently checked in on us to make sure we had everything we needed); and tasty entrees (my veggie burger + house salad was delicious - ranks up there in the veggie burger class for me; others had the lobster dip, wings, pizza and hamburgers and all said delicious).  We made sure to tip well to express our appreciation for a rest family dinner out and will definitely return!  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Un peu deçu par l'ambiance. Le service est très lent, je confirme et ce, même pour une bière....les spéciaux ne sont pas de 5 @7, mais de 4@6. La bouffe..boff..."}
{"text":"Can't ever go wrong at JA

The place is always lit - food and drink are on point too and fair price!"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks after work. Just a warning, be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes for your drink! Had the fresh guacamole and chicken fingers which was good. Overall, I always come back... Just annoyed at the service everytime I come here"}
{"text":"Horrible experience at this particular location.
Was there last night, over 15 minutes to take our order after being seated. Waitress comments that she was waiting on my friend to get off the phone. 

Finally ordered a couple of beers. And a calamari, which was burnt tiny and bitter. There was no flesh just burnt crumbs.

Staffs look like they aren't interested in there customers.

Been to other JA locations, which are way better and no complains.

This place in a prime Scarborough location. Is horrible will never go back in there"}
{"text":"First time I've reviewed anything from this chain, and good timing I suppose since most other times previously would've been a 3 star review. However, they've clearly improved their menu and from this recent visit: their execution of the food itself.

Though it has a bar vibe, they are still very family friendly. The kids menu is huge and great value. My kids had: pizza, mixed veggies, chicken bits (?) and fries. The pizza quality was much better than I expected with a genuine tomato sauce used and fairly authentic crust. The chicken is great quality and doesn't taste like it was frozen. Surprisingly, the mixed veggies are what impressed me the most as I expected the overcooked, water logged broccoli, carrot, cauliflower mix you normally get. A couple of those familiar veggies were in it, but they were cooked properly leaving them a bit crisp prepared with butter and herbs. It even had snow peas which my son devoured. Each kids meal came with a drink and desert (even that had 4 choices). Even little things like not serving the cheapest ice cream available but real dairy was apparent.

I went with their ahi tuna sandwich. It was almost bore semblance to a sushi roll with the sushi only being lightly seared and then having a spicy mayonnaise with avocado. In this case it was served on sourdough bread rather than a roll, but you get the idea. The side salad was massive and I love how the oil and vinegar option for dressing was actually being presented with a bottle each of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

My aunt just had soup and salad, but was equally impressed with the salad and enjoyed her soup.

Huge draught beer selection and no complaints with my pour. We had terrific and timely service throughout.

Jack Astor's has stepped up their game and distinguished themselves from some of their competitors."}
{"text":"Do not go here! Me and my friends were treated differently cus of our skin colour. When we were seated our waitress took our order for drinks, when she returned she told us that we have to leave a piece of ID or credit card with them in order to get served. She claimed she was doing it to everybody. Anyways I actually leave my drivers licence with them and continue ordering. When it was time to go I asked for the bill and my ID. The waitress said in a rude voice\" your not getting your ID back until the payment is processed\" after hearing this I started asking people at the other tables around us if they had to leave id or credit card to be served. They all said NO! I asked if they were regulars at this place and they said No again. So it turns out it was only our table that had their \"policy\". I think it's because were black and that we look young. Anyways it was a bad experience and not worth it. The food was overpriced and not that good, they wernt serving burgers and the waitress brought me the wrong drink. This was my worst experience at any establishment. What they did to us was wrong. Hope they go out of business!"}
{"text":"Went a couple weeks ago for a post-dinner snack, Leafs game, and drink for the other guys (since I don't drink).  At that time, this Jack Astor's was a test location for rebranding.

Unfortunately, this rebranding was to try to make the chain a bit more upscale.  I love Jack Astor's because it's got the perks of a bar with restaurant quality food.

I went mainly because I love their nachos.  Their nachos have changed to 6 nacho chips loaded with a bit of cheese and a bunch of greens for $8.  The waitress suggested we try it anyway.  Upon ordering and trying it (and seeing the portion size) I found this to be unacceptable and our waitress took them back and didn't charge us.

A couple pros that remain: bar selection is as good as ever, and our waitress was amazing.


They have quite a few changes to their menu from what I could see.  Overall, I was pretty dissatisfied.  Some items look appealing but it just isn't the Jack Astor's that I know and love.  I'm really hoping the chain doesn't end up going in this direction."}
{"text":"I came here for drinks with friends and I must say the service was excellent.  As soon as I came in and asked for a table for my big group the hostess already gave me hope that I will get the table soon and recommended I get the Monkeytini while I wait at the bar.  Sure enough I did as told and it was delicious.  A sugary drink with banana liqueur and a Popsicle as flourish.  So nice and refreshing.  The bartenders were very helpful and skilled.  There was a bit of show when one of the bartenders would cap off a freshly poured glass of beer with a coaster and toss it to the other end of the bar.  It was quite awesome and playful.  It felt like they did not take themselves very seriously as they performed this spectacle.  I thought that made a very relaxed atmosphere.  

When we finally got our table, the server got our orders immediately and in such a sweet and friendly manner.  We ordered nachos.  So the food did not blow my socks off but our very nice server kept refilling our salsa and sour cream and our drinks.  It was crowded for sure but that is how popular this place is getting to be.  I would go here again to be with friends and have a great time.  Maybe even go to the patio which looks really nice."}
{"text":"It was an Ok experience.  Prices are sky rocking for small portions. I won't be returning back. I don't think you should be paying  $30 dollars for a steak that is only the size of palm of your hand. PERIOD. Our bill for two people was $62 no drinks . We ordered Burbourn Steak thingy."}
{"text":"Nice place with a pretty good menu.
Had the bacon BBQ burger and it was very good.
Nice beer selection and nice atmosphere. 
Recommend a stop."}
{"text":"Best place I've found in Brampton so far to go out to eat at. Good looking girls 100's of tvs. I had an open face steak sammy with sweet potato fries was great. I will be back when I'm in Brampton again. Accepts American Express."}
{"text":"Food was very good but service was extremely iffy. Inattentive server caused our party of 9 to wait 25 minutes for drinks on a relatively slow Tuesday. I would give 2 stars but I like the concept and hope it was a one time experience."}
{"text":"Ive been to this Jack Astors a few times now and usually get their chicken fingers which are always really good.

Tonight I went for dinner with my girlfriend I got the crab and lobster dip appetizer (like a spinach dip but no spinach) and it had barely any crab and lobster but was otherwise good. I wasn't expecting a crazy amount of crab and lobster from a $13 appetizer but the picture really makes you feel like you'll get a decent amount not just a couple pieces so that was a dissapointment. Got chicken fingers and fries to share and a side order of their garlic mashed potato. The chicken fingers were great but the fries incredibly greasy and the mashed potato's weren't very good, there were chunks of lightly sautéed garlic sprinkled in which is way too strong a garlic flavour I was expecting roasted garlic that had been mixed into the potato's as thats generally how garlic mashed potato's are prepared. There was also a ton of oil just drizzled on top wasn't really sure why but it was offputting.

The other issue is although there was lots of staff who were all friendly they seemed disorganized. Our server took our order but two different people brought us drinks and a third person brought us our food. I say they are disorganized because we got our appetizer crab dip and less than a minute later all the rest of our food came out. Our server offered to take back the entree so we could finish the appetizer but it than took too long to bring a fresh entree...

All in all the food is just OK, the service was friendly but disorganized and the atmosphere is generally loud and busy Im not a huge fan of all the TV's (like 6 stacked on top of each other right next to us way too close)"}
{"text":"I've been to three Jack Astor's locations and I love all of them. I don't recommend this place for a date because of the loud and crowded atmosphere. I do recommend this place to larger crowds and birthdays. Every server is nice and friendly. If you're going to watch a game here, arrive early because seats fill up fast."}
{"text":"Went with a big group. Our server was mike. For the first 3 quarters of our time spent there he barely approached the table. Even other people who came by to collect empty plates were nicer in a two second period than mike was the whole night. Any time we needed something we had to call him over or he would walk away before we were able to order more. He warmed up a little bit near the end of the night but it was probably just to improve his tip. Wouldn't go back and sit in his section"}
{"text":"Great service and their patio is lovely. Come for the fishbowl drinks - they are so cute & delicious and refreshing!! Food wise my mango avocado and tuna was a let down - there were barely any avocados or mango.. it was all just greens. The tuna was seared and was not appealing or appetizing. Come for a chill patio drinks and maybe staple bar food."}
{"text":"Nachos are a must here with added beef and guacamole. 

Alex was a great server who recommended Somersby Cider with a shot of butter ripple. O.M G! Caramel apple bliss right here. 

Got the chicken tenders in medium, yummm. I always ask for honey garlic on the side so u get spicy and sweet in one bite. The chicken is always so tender and juicy. My go to food always. Everything else at jack Astor sucks arse haha


Conclusion: drinks are great, only get nachos, fajitas, or chicken tenders. DO NOT GO ASIAN (i.e pad thai)."}
{"text":"I've tried this place a few times and while the staff is pretty great, the food is not. Super greasy and expensive, managed to be a disappointment each of the three times we visited."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, unreal location and perfect patio. I had the nachos and it really was a large, fulfilling portion.  

Beers were slightly overpriced but again location is key so I assume it's comparable.

Great place to go after work with friends."}
{"text":"I will admit, I didn't come here expecting a stellar dining experience. It was only for the location and outdoor patio. Still, the food is an after thought at every Jack Astor's I've ever been. I ordered the Texas Roadkill Burger (seen here). The first thing I noticed when my food came was how thick the lettuce was. It accounted for at least half the thickness of the entire burger. Why? To somehow compensate for the fact that they skimped on everything. One slice of tomato, two pieces of onion, and a lack of sauce. Chicken breast was barely edible for how dry it was. 

Come here for the location. Not for the food. Best to stick with drinks and get your eat on elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great night out 

Decided to meet up with friends for a quick bite at 8:30 Saturday night. The place was busy so we couldn't sit in the bar area so we sat on the family side.

Our waiter was blake, nice guy and brought the food as quickly as possible still took a little bit but it was well worth the wait.

The wings we got were half medium heat and sesame garlic, very juicy and tasty. Only thing that sucked was a huge hair was stuck in the wings because they toss them at the table for you. Our waitress actually dropped a wing on the table making a mess lol I would of much preferred she did them
In the back. Lobster dip was great it came with pita and chips and was creamy and delicious I wish we had more or even ordered a second. The bruschetta was great and came on 5 slices of garlic bread with Parmesan cheese and a drizzle of ranch dressing. 

This is the best location for jack astors in Montreal trust me I've been to them all."}
{"text":"I live very close to this Jack Astor's so it's convenient if you just want beer and a simple meal.  They have definitely improved their menu over the years.  The burgers are pretty decent and their dessert menu has quite a few good options.  The portion sizes are enough to fill you up and I really like the pad thai bowl.  For a chain, the food prices are a bit on the high side but they often have deals like free dessert or money off your next visit.  

The service is hit or miss but I don't really expect too much here.  It's a good place to go if you're in the area and want some drinks/snacks while you watch some sports.  They have a nice outdoor patio in summer."}
{"text":"Very good place to be with friends! My friends and I went here for a late night drink and most of the food on their menu are still available to order. Hreat selection of drinks and food."}
{"text":"Best place for drinks and food. A lot of fun and good times. You can meet a lot of people from different countries there very interesting. Services great all around."}
{"text":"Attentive and seamless service.  No complaints at all.  The atmosphere was intimate and warm. You felt like you entered another world where your needs were the priority. Seems strange to say something like this about a restaurant chain but it really was a good experience.  Food was also presented well and delicious.  We would go back in an instant but it is further away from our circle of frequently attended restaurants. Darn it!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place you go for the atmosphere, not the food. The food here is basically pub V2.0. You have your standard pub fare like fish n chips, burgers etc but they add their cheeky twist to it. Jack Astor is far from what I call a culinary experience. Seriously...don't expect much from the food. You pay $13 for a basic burger and that's their cheapest entree. It's not just a bang for your buck issue. The food is just...nothing special. Edible? Yes. Mind-blowing? No.

What you SHOULD be coming for is that awesome patio that oversees Dundas Square, and drinks. If you want to watch a game over a drink, and happened to be in the area, come here."}
{"text":"So my friends and I actually had a terrible experience where the service was so slow at an out of peak time that we almost had to walk out and ended missing part of a concert we had paid to go to and should have had plenty of time to get to if our waitress hadn't disappeared for 45 plus minutes. There was an option at the bottom of our receipt to take a survey about our experience, so I did it. Three or so days later I received a call from the manager saying that he was deeply sorry about our experience at our last meal and would love to have us come back and give them another chance and he even set a reservation for us. We were also assured that action had been taken so discipline the waitress from before. When we arrived for our reservation the manager came to our table apologized again and introduced \"one of the best servers\" and he was. After an awful experience it was so nice to have so much effort put into getting us back as costumers. The manager here clearly knows what he is doing and seems to genuinely care about the costumer. Our food and service was outstanding and I can say that myself as well as my friends will definitely return."}
{"text":"Will defo go back again...nice and helpful staff and good food...the drinks are also nice!"}
{"text":"Took my friend out for a 'cheer up' dinner a few days ago. It was his idea, so I said sure why not. 

I've been here many, many, times. I mean, who in Mississauga hasn't. From birthday dinners to sports events to even 'cheer up' dinners. It's safe to say, I've pretty much tried everything on the menu.

Our server that night was Ray. She was absolutely delightful. I know in my other reviews I say servers are generally nice - but she was GENUINELY nice. 
I complimented her on her make-up and eyelashes and we ended up talking about lashes for a good 10 minutes. Random, I know!

I wanted nachos and Ray recommended I get the 'Old Fashioned Macho Nachos'. They were delicious! I asked for extra salsa and my girl came through with extra, extra salsa! YES.

After a little while, we noticed she was busy with other tables and we had to go. So we flagged down the closest server to us and asked for the bill. He said, \"sure no problem\" and never came back to our table. 

We later saw him cleaning and setting up another table up. So naturally we knew he forgot.
We didn't bother asking him again. A manager (I think) saw us waiting and we finally got our bills. 

We waited a total of 20 minutes to pay. That was my only dilemma was waiting for our bills. 

Other than that, overall service and food was good. 
I just want to commend Ray for the personable service. You are the true definition of a girl's girl!"}
{"text":"We have been going to this Jack's location for MANY, many years. When they first changed the menu (and got rid of my favourite spinach dip) I was really disappointed. I tried the chicken tacos and I disliked them greatly. I was really sad that the restaurant had lost what makes it special. I decided to give it another shot, as this has been somewhere my family and I have been frequenting for so long. I got their sauced up chicken fingers (medium heat) and really enjoyed them. Others at the table enjoyed their steak and burgers. Everyone enjoyed their meals! We all shared the class garlic pan bread and, upon our waiter's recommendation, tried the honey butter garlic pan bread. This was AMAZING! 

I am happy to say that Jack Astor's has redeemed itself and I am eager to return."}
{"text":"came here with the family as my son won an Oakville Soccer Player of the game certificate (great marketing coup by Jack Astor's, given each child is awarded one by the coach over the season) which entitled us to a free kids' meal.

Service fast and friendly, but food is very mediocre.    Atmosphere is good, with some very witty artwork.

Kids had pizza (which my older son found too cheesy), burger (ok according to my other son).    They liked the brownie desert. 

I would *not* recommend the butter chicken.  The rice was pasty/warm, and the curry was \"ok\".  If you appreciate good indian food, don't order this.  My bad for not knowing better.

On the other hand my wife enjoyed her fish 'n chips.

I've been to this restaurant before and always tell myself I won't come back.    Again kudos to the marketing team for striking up the \"player of the game certificates\" with the Oakville Soccer club :)"}
{"text":"Sometimes you get to be on the receiving end of a good surprise.

Our order was running a tad late (the manager said it took 21 minutes) but nothing crazy.  I've experienced much worse at many other places.  But the manager came up to us and apologized and comp'd our meal.

We even said the apology was enough, but he insisted, and even said he'd comp the desert (which we were too full to order).

I wish all places would go this above and beyond.  But it was much appreciated, and has kept us being regulars."}
{"text":"We went there for a nice family meal, and the service was good. We were seated quickly and drink orders were taken by our server Paris and delivered within a few minutes. 

I got the fish and chips. The fish was delicious but there was only 1 piece, the fries were standard, nothing special but good. 

My wife got the veggie pizza and loved it. 

Daughter got chicken and French fries and had no problem eating it all, which is awesome considering she can be very picky. 

We got dessert as well ( I had to as the fish and chips wasn't enough for me). I got the smores sundae and loved it, wife had some kind of warm cookie/brownie hybrid which was also good, daughter had a warm cookie that came with her kids meal.

Overall my only complaint was the portion size for my fish and chips. Everything else was up to par."}
{"text":"You've been to one than you've been to most. however the staff are polite and competent, the place is clean and the bathroom is HUGE, even on the most busy of nights there should be no reason to break on urinal etiquette here."}
{"text":"My wife wanted to go to Jack Astors for dinner. She always orders the same Asiago Chicken Bowties. This was the first time we went to this location in downtown toronto. The chicken Bowties tasted like any other jack Astors she's been to. VERY GOOD!!!

I did not know what to order and asked the waitress what her recommendations was. She offered at few choices, the Buffalo  chicken Cobb salad, holy smoke BBQ burger, and anything on the big bowl section. I opted for the Holy Smoke Burger. It was one of the best burgers I've had in a long time! 

The only thing I dislike is the atmosphere. The interior design seems to be dated. They need to renovate the restaurant and perhaps make it more modern. We were sitting in a booth which allowed me to move my seat back and forth like a swing!

Overall if you don't mind feeling old, Jack Astors makes really Good food for a decent price around the area. I would also give this place a 5 star rating if their seats does not wobble."}
{"text":"I mean... it was better before the renovations. After everything just got cheap and more expensive. Came here with a friend, and we were so excited for the nachos, 16 dollars, we split it and we thought oh it would be worth it. The nachos come in, sure it's a big portion, but it's a big portion of crap. The cheese was extremely hard to swallow and it because it tasted so unpleasant, and the chips were so thin and stale it was like I was eating paper. My friend and I couldn't even finish it and there was more than half the portion left so we just left it so the waiter could come and take it back. Who the hell decides \"to make the nacho chip better, let's take out the insides and just leave the outside that would get them asking for more, and just for a laugh let's put orange goo called cheese on top and charge 16 dollars before tax\". Never coming to this location again."}
{"text":"Friday afternoon is when we decided to come. 

Started off with garlic bread I used to get as a kid.. meh. They messed up in the kitchen took forever and they put cheese which wasn't good because it wasn't cooked just cold cheese. They messed up a poutine gave me a regular with 3 curds instead of the smoked meat one it took forever to get that as well so I just picked at it. Super dry with barely any gravy cmon it's Quebec you gotta nail something. Nobody was in the place neither so no excuse for the slow service. Ordered a Long Island had to add shots because all I could Taste was lemon bar mix. It was a great drink after I had to buy 4 shots for each of our drinks.

Never been to this location not a huge fan the one in the west island is the real deal. Been going to that one since 5 years old. Most likely won't be back to this location just because they quality of the food, the messing up the orders and how long it took."}
{"text":"I have been up here in Toronto for the last few weeks and I found this spot from one of the people I work with. Jack Astor's is a decent sports bar with decent food. The draughts are huge and the HD wall of television is great. 

The food is ok on the whole. The chicken flat bread is well priced, good tasting and very tasty. One night I had a burger with fries and it was basic burger nothing to write home about. 

The staff is very nice and very friendly. There is music playing in the background that sets the mood when the massive wall size video panels start playing videos. 

I like it here and I plan on trying some other things and will get back to you with my review. It is so damn cold here it makes this place a warm and cozy place to hang out and just relax on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"The bar area does not have  a great service . I was very surprised that the waitress did not even introduce herself and the fact that no one have us the best drinks and options to order. Also no one cared to ask us if we wanted to her more or try new stuff like how they are usually at jacks...

Nevertheless I enjoyed as my company was enjoyable and I was mostly here to have a good time rather than actually test the culinary skills of the kitchen chefs 


I tried the walk the guacamole and believe me I could have made better guacamole any day than this one ... The fries tasted Normal and the drinks were fair, reasonable and tasted good...


My recommendation try the dining are and not the bar ... Of you get lucky you will be treated well. I have always had a very good impression of jacks as it is my trademark but a slight disappointment settled in... Still greatly a favorite bar and grill of mine!!"}
{"text":"Love the Garlic Pan Bread. It's always been my favourite because I've been scared to try anything else at Jack Astor's locations.

I tried the Fajita Bowl today and asked for extra jalepenos.
If you're comparing it to Burrito Boyz... please don't. The rice was hard and the vegetarian option didn't seem to have much in it at all. I wish there was a substitute for the shrimp, beef or chicken like tofu or tempeh. Please brace yourself if you're going to get the Fajita Bowl.

The sever forgot to bring our water and I ended up getting it when I had already downed all the jalepenos... not a cool move. Also went to the washroom and exactly 3 our or the 4 soap dispensers had no soap in them. Ouch"}
{"text":"This is a renovated Jacks which looks so different from when I used to visit it growing up. We came here just before the kitchen was closing on a Sunday night which was Civic Holiday long weekend. We called and they took our pre-orders so we'd still get served even though we were running late. The bartender was absolutely amazing and everyone there was accommodating from the security guard to the manager (I think) that took our pre-order. 

The Cheese Garlic Pan Bread here is an icon. I get it - and it alone - every time I come. It's warm with the right about if softness, cheese and warmth. It's a bit oily but the yummiest snack a person can have to just themselves to satisfy a late night craving. 

The Cesar I got here was to perfection. I've gone to quite a number of places and ordered a Cesar which was absolutely horrible. The presentation, taste and veggies were a delight to eat and sip on!"}
{"text":"This place is extremely loud, but I guess that's why you come here.  The decorations for Christmas were horribly tacky, but I guess you don't come here for the decor.  The only thing I'll really judge this place for is its food.  And it's really mediocre. It's not disgusting, but why pay $20 for extremely average dishes."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband for dinner and we were really disappointed. First, our server didn't provide us with utensils, wrong food was brought to us, and food was just dry. My husband asked for butter and took a good 10mins before it showed up. Next, we waited for another 10mins to pay. Felt like we were just being totally neglected. Experience was just terrible and did not even expect my minimum expectation. Never coming back."}
{"text":"1was clean and well put together.  Staff seemed nice .prices were way to high for the portions and the fries were frozen not even fresh .I won't go back as I hardly eat out and I remember going to the one on hiway 7 yrs ago and it was amazing ."}
{"text":"Jack's is a SIR corp chain.  This particular Jack's has been at the same location for quite a while now and I've seen them flip their menus many times as they don't have the same thing and seem pretty dynamic.  What I do miss the complimentary garlic bread in the small pan.  THAT was amazing.  You can still add it to a meal or buy it by itself but IMO it was one of the reasons to go to Jack's in the first place kind of how Red Lobster has their garlic cheese biscuits.  It's like a carb staple that people would cheat their diet to have.

They have a pretty spacious patio facing the new north west section of Sherway Gardens and while the patio is nicely covered the seating is a mix.  You have your low seating near the perimeter and group high long benches in the middle sort of separates the high from the low seated crowd and high tables along the side of the wall.  

We decided to sit on the patio tonight seeing as how the weather was sort of decent and these days the inside seemed a little darker and the AC was blasting hard.  Now don't me wrong I like comfortable AC but sometimes and in some areas it can be too strong.  I felt it's almost cold inside and I'm not really one to complain about that.

The menus seem sort of simple and limited I suppose even though there's a wide variety.  Between standard type starters and some special starters from the feature menu there are some choices but not too many that appeal to me.  When I go to a bar you expect the expected sort of like nachos, wings etc.  Some of the featured apps were a couple kinds of poutine, one of which had pierogies on it.  I like pierogies but not on poutine.  The other one had vegetables on it.  We just went with the calamari which was a decent size and was ok.  

Besides the choices of chicken parm, fish and chips, sandwiches, burgers, chicken fingers etc this fare basically is just so common and you see it just about everywhere.  Nothing really special here that stands out (besides their bread) so overall I have to say with a variety of choices they seem pretty mundane for a city that has some of the best restaurants and diversity of cuisines in the country, this place makes itself just another chain with a mundane selection of SAFE choices.

I went for a burger again which seems to be a fallback choice for me these days.  I'm not about to get pad thai or chicken parm at a chain restaurant any time soon because those dishes can be had elsewhere, probably for less and \"more\" authentically true.  

The burger I went with was the Holy Smoke that had smoked bacon, American cheese, hickory mayo, smoky BBQ sauce, crispy fried onions, and pickled banana peppers.  This meal came with a side of fries and was just OK.  Like I said nothing spectacular here and really nothing special.  Standard is as standard does equals 3*."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of five, we were greeted and  quickly seated at a corner table. I normally come to Jack Astor's for their chicken parmigiana, but their golden calamari is great as well. Today I ordered The Classic with a side of caesar salad and surprisingly a drink called Blue Raspberry Lemonade. 


BLUE RASPBERRY LEMONADE: Never again. This drink was horribly made. It was a terrible concoction. You couldn't taste the vodka nor raspberry, the beverage itself was just all lemon juice. It was impossible for me to chug it as it would just become more sour and unbearable the more you chug. 

THE CLASSIC: Comes with lettuce and tomato, and with two beef patties. Tasted normal, was seasoned, honestly; nothing extraordinary. 

CAESAR SALAD: Salad was executed terribly, there was literally almost to no dressing. If anything, the bacon bits made up for the dish, and the croutons were enormous (unfortunately I'm not a fan of croutons). 

 Next time, I'm sticking to what I know. Would I come back here again? Eh."}
{"text":"Always likedbJack Astors.  Today was no exception.  Very busy at this time (Sunday 8pm).
Server Shawna was excellent.  Had a minor poutine issue but this was quickly resolved by the manager Jeff.  
Overall great guest experience."}
{"text":"It's not trendy, it lacks identity, and half of it is a family venue. But....

Jack Astor's may very well have the absolute best service I have ever experienced in Calgary. I frequent the place due primarily to proximity. The service has been consistently excellent.  I was starting to forget what good service was like. This is actually becoming a commentary on the state of hosting in Calgary, but Jack Astor's really reminded me of how much positive attitudes and friendly staff go a long way to enjoying your night.

Beer selection is good. Not great, but good enough, with a variety of non-big-beer options to choose from. Granville Island comes to mind. The food is interesting--it's kind of hit and miss. Some items are brilliant and healthy such as the affordable $12 Lamb Kafka. Other things are a little bewildering, such as $14 chicken fingers and fries. The pizzas are good, at around $13 for what appears to be a 10\" (more than enough food) with a healthy dosage of toppings. I recommend the Spolumbo's.

So, in the end, if you want to be absolutely blown away by service or simply reminded of what good hosting looks like, give Jack Astor's a try. Sit in the lounge and watch the bartenders practice their flair. Watch the game on their multitude of TVs or turn your attention to some FHV-style videos on the aux TVs. You might just have a fun."}
{"text":"Signed up for their v.v.v.i.p program, would have been nice if I got the discount they offered while I was there. Oh well.
   It's the typical jack astors, good food. 
We sat on that patio loved the mister. :) nice location"}
{"text":"This is one of my many visits to this location (Front by St. Lawrence market) of Jack Astors. I've been to half a dozen other locations but this one in my opinion is the best. Consistently meeting or exceeding my expectations in all key areas... food, service, and atmosphere. 
Impressively 20 years ago I wouldn't even want to step into any Jack Astors. But now clearly something changed at Jack Astors... I see a huge difference in how they operate. Keep it up!!! Jack Astors."}
{"text":"Went there tonight because we have odd days off during the week due to busy schedule and all the other places in Newmarket on a weekday close at 9 or 10pm. We had a great experience! Our server dani was awesome! She was so attentive and friendly. Everything we ordered came so fast and was great! 

Update - went back the following week and had dani again and she just as amazing!! This is our new spot for sure! The great customer service goes a long way!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my friends after pan am closing ceremony. We were all hungry and they wanted to play it safe and go somewhere familiar rather than try something new.

We shared nachos, calamari, and a chicken BBQ pizza. Pizza felt like food leftovers thrown on top of a pizza dough that was not well cooked. Calamari was dry and not fresh. Nachos plate was HUGE but needs more cheese and better dips. Not worth it.

Nice patio. They kept spraying us with mist. Some of us liked it while others didn't.

Come here for the drinks and the company of friends. Enjoy a pint of beer and steer away from the food."}
{"text":"This place is super cool. The bar area is a great place to hang out while waiting for your movie to start. It has some amazing chandeliers made from old corona bottles and tequila bottles. The drink menu has some interesting choices, I tried the Limonade à la Framboise Bleue and the Naufragé and both were amazing. The dining room side is also quite nice, you can choose from sitting at a table or booth. Bonus: you can colour while you wait for your food :). My friend and I ordered two entrées to share and both were delicious. We had Fresh Guacamole and Golden Calamari. Another bonus: when we ran out of chips for our guacamole, the waiter brought us more. The waiter was super friendly and efficient. The food came amazingly fast and the decorations are great conversation starters. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went here twice with my fiancé, and both times were not so good. First time we ordered fish and chips and a chicken sandwich. The food was okay. We finished our food and ordered a sangria which took 20 minutes to get to us, at this point we were ready to just ask for the bill and leave. 

Second time, my fiancé ordered the chicken quesadilla and I the chicken poutine. The chicken in the poutine was freezing cold, they didn't even hear up the already pre prepped chicken breast! To top that off, the gravy wasn't even hot. Sent it back to the kitchen and it looked, and tasted like they had microwaved it for 30 seconds and it was still cold!"}

{"text":"Stopped here for late lunch with 2 boys ages 12&14. I ordered the BBQ burger and my husband ordered the classic burger both with fries. Boys had wings and a poutine. The poutine I thought was a side order it was so small and the burgers were not massive. The bowl of fries was quite small as well. My burger was delicious however I ended up having a white curly hair in my burger. They took care of my meal but I left unable to eat and hungry. Both boys ate everything on their plate which is unusual...but shows how small the portions are. Won't be back .."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow.  House was less that half full.  Drinks were very slow from the bar.  Waitress forgot to order appetizers.  Drinks went dry and waitress told us \"you need to plan ahead\"!  Hard to do when your waitress disappears.  Orders came, one was wrong.  It took 10 minutes for the wrong order to come out, wrong again.  Supposedly the staff was at a party and the whole staff were substitutes.  If this was true the manager should be fired!  This was during the international film festival but they were getting no business while other houses were booked.  Now I know why!  The wrong order was comped."}
{"text":"After going to Baton Rouge at Eaton Centre, right away I thought the food was so much better at Jack Astors  at a fraction of the price. Service was amazing! 

I ordered Butter Brushed Steak (medium-well) with mashed potatoes and a house salad, I think it was around $20. It was no filet mignon but it tasted sooooo good. The steak was juicy and tender. The mashed potatoes and salad tasted great as well. I'm doing the review a few weeks after my visit. 
Well at least you can tell I'm still thinking about it hahah. And I had a drink called Beached. Its like a Blue Hawaiian. The service was friendly and pretty quick. If I'm having dinner at STC, it'd probably be here!"}
{"text":"I had a pretty good dinner here yesterday.  I generally assume everything is going to be the same at a given chain restaurant but they seem to take extra care here to make things look good presentation wise.  Food is pretty consistent and similar relative to other Jack Astor's I think.  A group of us met up here because the Jack Astor's in the Toronto Life Building/Dundas Square doesn't accept reservations after 5.30pm on a Friday; this one however, does.  

At the recommendation of the server for me specifically, I had the Beijing Beef Salad (which I thought was funny - I was one of two Asians there) and was somewhat skeptical at first in trying to figure out how they would bastardize/reinterpret Chinese food.  Surprisingly it was pretty good though maybe slightly on the salty side or my taste.  It seemed like a fairly good sized portion (with noodles + dressing and beef unspecified, is cooked medium rare).  This was $13 pre-tax.  The person next to me had the Chicken Santorini which also looked really good and was wishing I had gotten initially (chicken breasts + red peppers and feta along with whole wheat pasta with tomato sauce) - at a cost of $17.  I should have taken a few pictures but forgot.

The location is decent - across from the Scotiabank Theatre and the Chapters Bookstore.  The patio outside is great in the summer as well.  I've dropped by here a few times to meet friends for drinks.  It's decorated like any standard Jack Astor's - relaxed, bar/grill type environment.

The service was pretty good.  They forgot my second drink but they provided it with compliments when they realized the mistake (though it was a coke so I'm not sure if refills are complimentary or it was because they forgot to bring it to me initially and I didn't bother to ask).

We were a group of 9 people.  I don't know at what point the mandated service charge kicks in, but it did for us - which is both convenient and annoying in a way.  I suspect they would get better tips if it were at the individual's discretion."}
{"text":"The meal was alright. Ordered strawberry daiquiris, but they weren't that great. The location was convenient and the service was good. We order their burgers for dinner. They were pretty good for the most part. My companion thought that his burger had a bit of a burnt taste, which might have come from the way they toasted his bun. Overall, it was good food, good service and bad mixed drinks."}
{"text":"This place is great. I traveled from New York for the weekend and it was a great place to stop by on a Sunday afternoon to catch the football game. Everyone here was very nice and the servers were great. The food here was very good. Try the wings ! Perfect for Sunday football. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I came in on Feb 3. Had their Chapula Taco w chicken and now have been sick with food poisoning!! Clearly bad food practices at Bloor Yonge location! You have been warned. 
A chain of this type should have better practices when it comes to their customers health and safety."}
{"text":"I think Jack Astor's got a makeover, and I like it! This restaurant is a nice trendy place to have a few drinks and a tasty meal. Now they aren't fancy meals by any means, but they are satisfying and pretty good. I like the chicken fingers and the Korean BBQ chicken skewers were really good. If you haven't been in a while, go check it out!"}
{"text":"This Jack Astors sucks. They don't have regular menu items like the fries stacks, their beer soup is weird, no Cobb salad and the food just sucks. Will avoid in the future."}
{"text":"Went there again (foolishly), but more so because I forgot my previous experience. I shall commit to memory that I shall not return because I want their food. Their service was what is generally expected from a restaurant of such caliber. The atmosphere and the joys of being among friends (or colleagues) would be your primary reason for heading out. 

I was disappointed with the shrimp pasta dish; although the quantity served wasn't the issue. It just lacked zest. The pasta was mushy, while the shrimps were mediocre at best. Unfortunately, the restaurant didn't have spaghetti or fettuccine available.

Others around the table had other entrees, and looked alright."}
{"text":"Le burger sans viande au fromage de chèvre est vraiment ça coche !!! Le personnel au bar est très efficace et agréable. Par contre, les 2 sortes de sangria qu'on m'a servies étaient  assez décevantes ..."}
{"text":"Not my favourite Jacks location. 
Came here for lunch and ended up paying $20 for a salad and half a chicken breast. The salad was bland and the chicken was overcooked. Might have just been a bad day, but overall I'd have to say that $20 can go a lot further elsewhere if you're looking for food in the area. 
Service was great as usual though for a Jack Astors, that's the only reason I'm giving a 3 instead of a 2/5."}
{"text":"Nothing special but safe choice for dinner. After they've started posting their calories on their menu I'm less likely to come here...

Hopefully they can add some healthier choices in the future :)"}
{"text":"We had the fish and chips and chicken fingers - they were all quite good. I especially liked their fries. The server we had was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"JA Y/D has an unbeatable patio. No wonder this place is prime during summer and even fall nights. It's a perfect place to unwind, pretty much anytime of day. 

Location aside, food and drinks are a bit pricey for what you get. You pay for the privilege of dining smack-dab in the middle of downtown, not for quality of food. The food selection is of course enough... more than enough. Everything is typical bar food however. It's not bad but certainly nothing special either.

So I thought to myself, if I weren't sitting on this beautiful patio overlooking Dundas square amongst friends and taking shots of patron, would I enjoy any Jack Astors location? The answer is no.

Overall, the atmosphere is casual and lively. It's always full and bustling. The waiters/waitresses are very nice and you can draw on your table without being yelled at. However, the food is mediocre and the prices don't justify the portions or taste. Enjoy their patio whenever you can and go with a few friends.

I used to think Pickle Barrel was a better place to bring outside guests or friends to, but Jack Astors has certainly proved itself."}
{"text":"Always enjoyed this bar and grill. We've had a great many family dinners their with our family. Our granddaughters really love this place. The meals never disappoint. The staff are always very friendly and helpful.

{"text":"Decided to come here with a group of 6 after we were informed of a 30-45 minute wait for Joey's.  We were seated immediately, with numerous televisions around playing sports for the night.  Our waitress was enthusiastic and relatively quick with our orders.  We mainly came for appetizers and drinks, as we had all already had dinner.  I wasn't a fan of their guacamole, but the nachos were otherwise decent.

They had 18 beers on tap, and we had pitchers of Rolling Rock, Sam Adams, Flying Squirrel.  The Rolling Rock with somewhat flat, but the other two were much better.  The glasses they provided us weren't chilled, which is always bothersome for me.  Overall a good experience, with decent service, but would still probably only come back here as a second option."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and have never been let down. Great food, not too bad of a service. Their calamari is to die for. Waiting time does change depending upon time and day you visit, but over all the customer service is pretty good."}
{"text":"I come to this bar every time im in the City. Without fail! It has a great atmosphere, the wait staff , as well as being super friendly and attentive no matter how busy it gets, know their menu by heart and always make great recommendations on beers. I do eat meat, but when here, I've always ordered their veggie burger with sweet potato fries. It rocks!
In summer it also has a great patio area outside, with heaters for those not so sunny days."}
{"text":"My office is in the area Yonge/Sheppard, and once in a while we go here for team lunches.  The best way I can summarize this place is: nice place/environment, overpriced mediocre food.  Great place to hangout and have a few drinks and watching a sporting match, but for dining, you're best off going to the Union Social a couple blocks south for superior similar type food (with more variety) for less (they have TVs here too).  I've been at the place about 4 times and every time I am disappointed with the quality of the food for the price they ask.  So meh."}
{"text":"Great spot to watch sports and have a drink and/or a meal. Ask for Jasmine or Amber. They're both great & take good care of you."}
{"text":"As far as bars go, Jack Astor's usually doesn't disappoint.  This location has a large draft beer selection.  It has a busy, trendy patio which they open up the wall to connect it inside, allowing for sports to still be watched from the patio.

The food is not bad, usually served quickly.  I find the wings are always a a safe bet, tangy sauce, well fried."}
{"text":"Jack Astor's hasn't changed a bit in the last decade.
They have plenty of classic restaurant chain dishes that are okay but nothing spectacular that will knock your socks off and some of the dishes are bland. There isn't really a specific reason unless you are with a group and it becomes a compromise. They probably need to freshen up !!!"}

Ambiance festive et bruyante même quand on est les deux seuls dans tout le restaurant! Je me suis abonné aux promotions si c'est intéressant j'y retournerai pour voir si ça a changé!"}
{"text":"I wanted to thank my server, Syeda, for her amazing service on Sun, Oct 22nd. A \"friend\" of mine made a reservation for 10 of our \"friends\" to join us in celebrating my birthday. Me and two friends arrived on time at 7:30 and were seated at a 12 person table. As soon as we were seated, Syeda came over and wished me a happy birthday, which was so nice. We waited and waited for these people to arrive. We ordered our food right away because we were starving and couldn't wait any longer. By 8:30pm it became apparent no one else was showing up. 

Embarrassed, I politely apologized to Syeda for the hold up of the table, as Jack Astors could have accommodated another large party, and also asked if we could be moved to one of the booths in front of us. I also let Syeda know why we were switching tables as well. She was so gracious and understanding even after having to replace the table sheet and all of the cutlery and glasses on top because we doodled all over the paper.

The food came and was great as usual. Towards the end of our meal, as always for birthdays, a group of people came out to sing to me - but the group was visibly larger! My friends and I were so busy grumbling about our loser \"friends\" that we totally forgot about this birthday song! Syeda then handed me a pretty yellow card, that said \"Happy Birthday Alicia - Jackastors\" with hearts and balloons all over it! And the customary Jacks birthday desert that seemed more than usual too. Once they left I opened the card and there were signatures from her and other staff members as well! I can't describe how happy that made me feel!

Syeda went above and beyond to make sure I had a great night. Not only did she practice great customer service, but a huge level of empathy as well. She was amazing and I couldn't have asked for a better server! She was so gracious, patient and understanding. Thank you so much for making my night so memorable!  Shoutout to Bruno, Quincy, Cynthia, Connor, Christine and Bahar for signing the card and participating in making my night along with Syeda! PS: Give them all raises!"}
{"text":"With great places to eat comes great waiting times...or not so great. But i have (happily) waited 40minutes to be seated at Jacks because for a franchise there is nothing else like it. Good food, good drinks and fun atmosphere. You walk in and you can literally feel yourself de-stress. The posters help.

Try absolutely anything on their menu because its all good. I highly recommend the crab dip!! Their nachos are good too- i opt for sans chilli (too heavy) but thats just me. My faves: chicken parm & bowties, fajitas and fish&chips. 

Raspberry twister in their outside patio (ahh summer)
Big groups can enjoy their own private elvis booth. Its a corner booth with wall to wall elvis heads."}
{"text":"I can't hear you!!!!!
That's always the way at Jack's. 

Used to be the only stand alone restaurant at the Scarborough Town Center, but thankfully now has lots of competition. 
The food here is kind of nasty, the menu is always changing (thanks to being owned by a corporation that is always looking to make more money).
Last time we went, I ordered some sort of lemonade with ice cream in it, it was filled with seeds, the server did not care.
I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Came here after steam whistle brewery so I've already had a few \"samples\" walking in . I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly we were seated (well, we were told to seat ourselves) but nonetheless it was quick. We got our appetizer extremely quickly as well as our food, which were both quite good. My chicken parmigiana had roasted slices of garlic which tasted a bit overcooked and we're crunchy and burnt which is part of the reason I didn't give 5 stars. The service also seemed a bit rushed but it's a Friday night so I get it. The only reason I give it 3 stars was because even after an appetizer and dinner, we were still hungry because the portions were quite modest. 
Overall, it was a good place to stop by for a quick bite to eat on a Friday night."}
{"text":"The daughter and I went here for something different.  Initially my daughter wanted some four cheese dip but we settled on the lobster / crab dip with nacho chips and toasted pita.  

For our main we both ordered burgers.  My daughter had the locally inspired Drunken burger. I had the big smoke burger.  

The issue was both the appetiser arrived at the same time as the main.  The server blamed the cook staff.  We weren't given an option about our order.  This truly wrecked the meal."}
{"text":"Kids meals still good but prices are going up and quantity going down.

Hint: if you don't like pink in the middle ask them for well done otherwise expect some (as per manager it is because they are made fresh)."}
{"text":"I'm pretty much a Jack's fan because my kids like their chicken fingers and French fries. CF made with real chicken breast and not the process chicken from fast good places. What is disheartening  is their menu choices are getting slimmer but prices are going up (with also much less on the plate ). For instance burgers went from 9.99 to 11.99 and now 15.99???  There are better burger places at lower the cost."}
{"text":"Horribly slow service.  We had to ask for everything, utensils, napkins, drinks were made incorrectly.  He didn't even want to take a drink order and replied \"I though you just wanted water\"?
Food took forever, seemed they were more worried about closing early then servicing the customers.

We even had to chase the server down for the bill. This may be the first time I do not tip."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here last night after the Raptors game. Security was checking IDs before going in. I was flattered!! Haha!!! So bring your ID.
We got a table on the bar side. Drinks took a while to come but the tvs playing games and good music playing made up for it. Hiphip rap etc from 10+ years ago. I looked around at the different tables and everyone was singing along. 4 stars for the atmosphere. More of a bar-feel than restaurant.
The bathroom is far and down a flight of stairs. Ladies wearing heels that had a couple drinks could easily fall down them. Be careful."}
{"text":"OMG what happened to Jack Astor's. The worst food I have ever had.. wet soggy bland chicken, with a side of make me puke parmesan fries, soggy croutons, bruschetta that would make my mom roll over in her grave...was anything good???  Ya my drink!!!!
This doesn't deserve any stars but it would not let me post without putting 1 so to be clear it gets no stars."}
{"text":"We love it here because of the patio way up high over looking Yonge & Dundas square.....we sat down and ordered drinks with our server and they were promptly delivered .....ordered our lunch;  one quesadilla & one appetizer salad.  

Our server brought our food and asked if you wanted fresh ground pepper we said no but we could really use some cutlery and napkins she was a little surprised but then returned with them. 

We didn't see your server until we were finished and then she asked if we wanted more drinks but that point we needed to go .....another drink would've been nice 20 minutes before.... 

The chicken quesadilla was actually really good the appetizer salad had far too much dressing on it. The Mojito and the Margarita were just okay not a repeater."}

{"text":"Typical Jack's, no matter which location you go to.

I got the Dirty Bird Chicken Sandwich with fries. The chicken tender fingers were spicy! There was also hot banana peppers and fried jalapenos. If you can't handle spicy, this isn't for you. It's a bit more expensive than most places considering the food (and 3 chicken strips) and the food and service isn't special.

Parking is hard to come by, especially at the Shops at Don Mills. Atmosphere was good, lots of TVs with different sports on. Not much wait for a table. Waiter spilled the drinks on the floor and got some on me. The staff didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"Reached Jack Astor's in search of dessert while exploring the area. Most restaurants and ice cream parlours were shut, but we desperately needed some ice cream in warm -10 evening. Astor's came to the rescue. 
Surprised at the average reviews for the place. But we had a great night. Can't be sure about the food...we just had a draught beer - can't complain, a mock tail - pretty decent, regular fries - frozen not house cut :(  with chipotle mayo , s'mores Sunday - fantabulous. 
The atmosphere was super casual, the brown paper and crayons on each table is a genius idea for the establishment. Service was a bit on the slower side, but not too bad. Lots of screens with sports on to keep you busy, in case you get bored of drawing your life. 
I also love the fact the subway entrance is right below the restaurant."}
{"text":"Had some time to kill before the movie so we came here to have a drink. 

This is not my usual type of place but I like that they have paper table cloth with crayons for you to have fun.  I know I know...I am not a kid but meh who cares...

I also like that they have hooks at each booth for you to hang up your coat.

The servers were very professional. We weren't really hungry so only ordered a few apps to share but we sat for awhile just chatting. Despite this, he remained courteous and had our separate bills ready.

The food...again not my usual type. So we ended up getting their signature pan bread which was very soft and garlicky and savoury. It was just the right spot. The drinks are also of huge portion but not very remarkable.

Overall was a good experience with the right company and convenience"}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times. When I have friends or family visiting we go here. The patio is lovely in the summer and they winterized it so it gets used year round. I'll do my review based on the two times we went this week. 
Tuesday 4:30- we stopped in because we were starving and didn't eat lunch that day. We were seated right away. We ordered the Holy Smoke burgers with fries. I got sweet potato fries and we had a pitcher of Coors. Burger was great. Food hot. Service was great. We left happy with plans of coming back Friday with friends. 
Friday 10pm- we arrived and saw 4-5 hostesses and staff sitting in a booth hanging out. We stood there awkwardly waiting to be acknowledged. A female (unfriendly) eventually looked at us and said 10 minute wait. We sat and waited, looking at the empty tables easily visible from where we were. 
A male came over and took us to our table. I ordered the mango fish bowl (waiter's suggestion) and it was excellent. Bigger than I expected and took me much longer to finish it then I expected. The other couple we were meeting walked in and the hostess told them 25 minute wait. Again, many empty tables. They walked over after seeing us, already seated. We ordered a few appetizers and our mains. Broccoli bites x2, calamari then ahi tuna mango avocado salad, Mexican salad and chicken tenders x2. 
Two salads came out first. I pushed mine to the side as I wanted the appetizers first and figured the kitchen got mixed up. Then out came 2 chicken tender orders. We decided to all eat. Why let food get cold or our salads soggy. As we are eating, our appetizers came out. I was so irritated. The staff dropping off the food made jokes about the kitchen messing up but no one offered to do anything. We ate the food and were stuffed. No one checked on us as we ate. Everything tasted great though. We stayed having drinks. I got hungry again later and was disappointed our food wasn't more spread out like we had intended. 
We do believe there was a mistake on our bill. (Overcharged). Oddly enough when we tried doing the online survey, our code on the check is invalid. Did the server go back and deduct the \"mistake\" and pocket the money? That would make the check we took home invalid and explain why it's not working. We paid cash so I think it's possible but I don't know for sure. 
Would I go back? Yes. It's close by. The food is great. Lots of free parking. Menu always changing. 
I would also like to point out there was LOTS of security there walking around as it got later. I liked this. I felt safe. We left at 2am and I was impressed by all the security walking around inside and outside. I haven't seen this anywhere else in the area."}
{"text":"I popped in here Wednesday. I was celebrating my birthday....alone. Fun right! So I figured I'd go here to cheer myself up. I had their blue cocktail (bartender's recommendation) and I had the tuna avocado salad. Salad was good but the fruit was definitely frozen. Drink was alright. Not sure if I'd order it again. The picture on the menu made it look better. The bartenders and hostesses were really friendly though so that helped make me feel less lonely. I sat at the bar watching the TVs and the snow fall. Would I recommend it? Yeah it's alright. Would I return? Yeah."}

- bruschetta
- lobster and cream cheese dip with pita.

The venue is very likely, good for group hang outs. But it does get loud and we needed to yell at each other, that's expected. 

Onto the food and drinks. We ordered lots of appetizers, bar finger food mostly: nachos, wings, quesadilla and etc. We also ordered a tuna tar tar dish with fried wonton skin, tuna pokers? That's a surprise that's good. 

Service was good for such a busy place. Our server kept an eye on us for refills. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"If you want to pay $15 for 3 chicken fingers and fries, by all means go here. However for the other 99% of people who think that is insane, go elsewhere!

To sum it up: Gross, overpriced crap."}
{"text":"We've been to Jack Astor's lots of times. In fact....we were at the down town location last week and had a great experience. 
Tonight....not so much.
Came to the Progress Ave. Location.
Seated right away, we identified ourselves as a fun table by joking with the hostess. Either the hostess and the wait-staff don't talk or he didn't care. Seated at 8:40 as was written on our cool brown paper tablecloth (nice idea and time checked right). We coloured in our pictures on the table with supplied crayons further identifying ourselves as a fun table. Our server mumbled his name in introduction with his hands full....asking for drinks and saying he'd be right back with them.
8:50 the drinks come and he indifferently took our order. 
22 minutes later our food comes by way of two other servers. 
Our waiter comes by and says \"You need anything? \"
Wow....seemed to be friendly with the two tables around us....but nothing for us.
After we had clearly not been eating for some time, he was clearing some excess plates from another table (not ours) when he stopped at our table to spend some time piling dishes together precariously near me (guessing he didn't want to come back again). Asking if we would like dessert I told him we were done. 10 minutes later he came by and I asked for the bill.
Left a bad tip and I don't feel bad for it.
I'd leave his name (which we found out when we got the bill) but I think it's up to management to deal with their wait-staff as they are ultimately responsible.
Will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"Why do I even bother.... going to this location. This is probably the worst one out of the whole franchise. Food is typical bar food nothing impressive. Compared to the Pickering location and other locations that have localized special meals/events. Also it's not cool to have kids running around as if it is a playpen."}
{"text":"One of the few chain restaurants I enjoy. Service is okay at this location. Prices are getting a bit high for the portions offered. Would recommend their stacked poutines, nachos with chicken, and the bowtie pasta. They have a really nice patio that is great for summer nights."}
{"text":"So, I'm just an American tourist who wanted some Poutine and some drinks to end the day.  Jack Astor's was very fun - it's at a great location at the corner of Yonge and Dundas and looks into Dundas Square - however, I had to sit inside because all the balcony seating was always taken and always had a long waitlist.  

Staff seems a little out of it...very slow at taking requests and forgot a few things a couple times.  Very friendly though!  Took quite a while to get drinks, but the bar was very busy.   

As the night went on, the music got louder, so don't come here if you want to carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"What a great time our waitress provide it 
a great service even though food took a long time, thanks Lawren"}
{"text":"Love the servers and food! Their sangrias are AMAZING. Servers are very kind and friendly despite how busy it gets there. Love going back there."}
{"text":"I generally really like Jack Astor's but this location specifically is awful. It's near my work so I've gone more than once during lunch hours and every time I do, the service is terrible. We called ahead of time to reserve a patio table for 5 and the hostess told us it was empty and to just come.. we showed up and they informed us the whole patio was booked for a last minute reservation. Our food took over an hour to come out apparently because of this patio reservation. The communication and slow service is not worth it. This service was the last straw for me and I'll never be going to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Oh man..I wish my boss didn't like this place so much.  I've been here numerous times (usually for free since I don't like spending my own money and the company pays since they are all \"company lunches\").  I've ordered their pizza, burgers and I think I even got something similar to general tao chicken on rice.  

Pros:
-Lots of tv's
-Food is tolerable

Cons
-Expensive for the quality of food
-Service can be wanting

I feel like this place is more of an event gathering but not a good lunch place as it seems like we always need 1.5 hours for 3-4 people and to me, a 1.5 hour lunch for fast food isn't worth it.  

There's enough quality fast food in the area that I can get much quicker."}
{"text":"Looking for a nice restaurant on Front Street, we got attracted by the cue outside this place and the nice seeing outside. The dinner was delicious. We had steak and burger as main course, just delicious and the creme caramel is also tasty! Cocktails are also great at this place! 
I would recommend friends who are in Toronto to check out this place."}
{"text":"My waiter just use his hand to show me there are two patties in my bacon cheese burger. Nice...."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best, and certainly not worth the price.  4 of us got steaks, most of which were tough and fatty.   So bad in fact, they had to use the fake A1 sauce to eat it.  I got the salmon, which was covered in oil.   Salmon is supposed to be healthy!   
The service was even worse.  It was slow.  Painfully slow.   I think we saw the waitress 3 times.   Take drink order, brought drinks and took food order, then brought the check (after we flagged her down of course).  I guess that's four times.  
Food runners brought the food, scattered out over 4-5 minutes between the first person and the last person getting their food - and there were only 5 of us.  
I would not go back.   I was very disappointed in almost all aspects.   Even the drinks were weak.  
Two stars for atmosphere and beer selection only."}
{"text":"I've been going to Jack Astor's since I was in high school and I have to say it's really changed since I was 14 - but definitely for the better. 

It used to have pretty generic bar food but they've since gone pretty upscale with their menu. 

The bruschetta is the most delicious thing that has ever touch my tongue and I could eat it for the rest of my life It's little crisp baguette slices with tons of juicy tomatoes, onions and parsley and then they drizzle balsamic vinegar and some kind of mayo sauce on top and it is just so insanely good. 

The Thai Chicken salad is great - they give big portions so you're never left hungry. The flatbread is also delicious as are the noodle bowls. 
Their frozen raspberry twister is delicious and refreshing and will take the edge off even the worst work week. I've never had a dish their that wasn't really satisfying. 

However, with their new upscale menu come upscale prices, so don't expect a cheap meal. 

This location has a great patio that looks onto University and Front but it attracts a huge after-work crowd and the it can get packed. Expect a 20 minute wait if you show up at 5 or 6 on Friday."}
{"text":"Colour me impressed.

I stopped going to Jack Astor's about a year ago after they switched chefs and got rid of their three peppercorn grilled chicken rigatoni.  I was devastated, and swore I would never return until they brought by back my beloved dish.

Fast forward to the present where I find myself desperately trying to find a restaurant I can eat at, having discovered I have a gluten allergy.  Ick.

Although hesitant, we decided to give Jack Astor's another go.  I'm glad I did.

After requesting it our server brought me the allergens/nutrition menu.  When she took my order, she confirmed my allergy, and reported it to the kitchen.  Shortly thereafter, a chef came to our table to confirm something with me about my allergy, and when my food was delivered, it was brought my a manager who promised that everything had been prepared away from gluten and would be safe for me to consume.

No restaurant has ever gone out of their way like that to make sure my allergy was taken seriously.  A large portion of restaurants just slap a disclaimer on their menu saying that they \"can't guarantee that there won't be cross contamination.\"  Jack Astor's took the time to make sure me and my stomach left happy.

Jack Astor's has won over my heart again."}
{"text":"Went here after work with two co-workers. We wanted to go out for one of our co-workers belated birthday. It was a Saturday night and it was HELLA busy. We were told it would be a 45 minute wait, but surprisingly my co-worker found a table by the bar and we waited for 2 minutes.

The food here is alright. I had the calamari and it was cooked perfectly. Two dips came with it and it was alright. One co-worker had chicken parmesan and a side of poutine (looked like she enjoyed it because she had no complaints) and my other co-worker had a veggie burger and she was pleasantly pleased with her meal. 

The only downfall was the dessert options.. or lack there of. We were so excited for dessert and it was just a disappointment. I just wish that they had more options when it came to dessert. Sucks. Oh well.

Overall, service was good. Our waitress was really friendly and polite. Just really loud - don't plan on going here for your first date... although, if you happen to come here on your first date and he/she is boring... you can watch interesting shows via the t.v's by the bar."}
{"text":"My favorite Jack Astor's location anywhere. The place is brand new. Very cool looking with multiple floors and the most amazing patio on the rooftop that I have seen in Toronto (including the Patios around Yorkville area). Very friendly staff, and decent food. If you are looking for a great bar, casual dining, in a cool atomosphere check out this new Jack Astor's."}
{"text":"If you are going to put on your menu that your chefs are so commited to food that they would-\"Fight ten Mexicans for the best avocado\" you better have such freaking amazing food/guacamole that I won't be able to see straight. I suppose I am partially to blame at the debacle I just experienced. I KNEW better...I told my sister that without a doubt it had to be like the old Bennigan restaurants from the 80's and 90's.

I digress... let me get back to my experience. We were seated promptly on the outdoor patio. Yes it is a lovely area. I ordered their IPA. What I got was definitely NOT an IPA. I asked the young lady who dropped it off if she was sure it was the IPA. She claimed it was and rushed away. The color was about the same as my sisters Moosehead Lager. And when I sipped it, there wasn't a single drop of hoppiness to be found. 

We happened to order the guacamole and decided to split their Cobb Salad because sometimes it's nice to eat a vegetable. The guacamole was embarassing. It reminded me of the stuff that comes out of a plastic pouch from the drugstore. Horrible. Next came our salad. It was missing the avocado which was brought to us after we inquired about it. The salad on a whole was pretty decent. The fried chicken Buffalo tenders were cold. I'm assuming because it's on a cold salad? The avocado that was brought out was pale yellow and flavorless...which explains the state of their guacamole. If you're going to boast about it shouldn't it live up to the hype?

All in all our bill came to $44 and some change...huh? How did that happen?! Oh well lesson learned...steer clear of the chains."}
{"text":"Nice place for drinks after work in the summer. The patio is great with lots of seating, umbrellas, and cooling mist. The food is decent but nothing special. Service was really friendly. No pear somersby yet..."}
{"text":"Very good as usual!
I love that they have added their gluten free tags on the menu and vegetarian ones as well!
I had the gluten free steak
And frites! It was absolutely
Amazing!! The fries were dusted in Parmesan and herbs while
I ordered the mushroom  sauce over my steak! It literally melted in my mouth! I wasn't very hungry, but I practically
Licked my
Plate lol
My husband enjoyed his dinner,
My kids ate all their food! We had fun scribbling all
Over their table
Covers and all the Tvs which have different videos playing which kept the kids entertained! The staff were good, except the wait to be seated which sometimes can be a drag... everything is really good"}
{"text":"I like the burgers here. They make them fresh each day, so they aren't from frozen.
The desserts here are also great.
This location is a test restaurant so the menu changes often."}
{"text":"Seriously, the Jack's Cheese Garlic Pan Bread is worth ordering every single time. Garlic in my mouth. Yes. Please. 

Service was great, atmosphere is solid, food is delicious. I am loving this place. Went 3 times in 3 days. Bam."}
{"text":"It was a great place. I like the atmosphere and great bar area. 
Place is affordable and the stake fajitas are fantastic.

Great place to eat, I recommend to any one."}
{"text":"Went for a dinner with a friend. 
There is a patio: which could use more comfortable seats.
Prices for food are good. Ordered a texas chicken burger with soup, as well as sweet potato fries for starters and a sundae for dessert. Burger and soup were too salty. 
Prices for drinks are high. 
Service is good."}
{"text":"They have the cutest little patio to host a girly luncheon. Lots of umbrellas to shade the tables from the sun. When it gets too hot the misters go off to cool things down. Their hanging flower baskets are well taken care and overflowing, a perfect background for a leisurely lunch. 

We escaped the crowds at the Scarborough Towne Centre and were looking for a place to eat outside the mall. What attracted us to Jack Astor's was their lovely outdoor patio. There was no line up and we were escorted to our table right away. Our server Mark/Marc was awesome. He answered all our newbie questions about the menu and gave suggestions to fit our tastes. 

We started off with drinks - Strawberry Mint Soda (Strawberry and lime juices with fresh mint and soda) and a Sassafrazz (Orange, Pineapple, Cranberry Cocktail, raspberry and Grapefruit juices with Sprite). They were light and refreshing.

I ordered the Steak frites subbing the fries with a side salad. The salad was fresh and the steak was cooked perfectly - seared well, a little pink in the middle, flavorful and juicy. 

My friend ordered the Roasted Double Chicken Breast which came with dirty rice (not the Southern Cajun kind of dirty rice), sautéed peppers, onions, avocado, and feta. She enjoyed the chicken and veggies but not the rice. 

Coming back with hubby for the steak!"}
{"text":"generally speaking franchises dont impress me.much so my 4 is a bit generous.  id say 3.5 is what my true rating is.  however the food was good.  steaks were cookéd to.perfection.  it took a little while for the food to.come out...but the place was ramned and extremely busy.  the service was decent.  all in all pretty good experience and not disapointed in any way. :)"}
{"text":"Came here couple nights ago.  Good atmosphere.  Very open and large bar area in restaurant.  Service and food were good.  Got trashed again with my quebecois friends (seems to be a trend here in TO). Good sit around and chat with friends atmosphere with sports on the big screen tracking most games."}
{"text":"This place is just okay.  Ordered the wings and the BLT chicken poutine.  The former was blah and full of fancy useless theatrics of shaking the wings and the sauce together table side.  The sauce was tasty though and is house-made which is a plus.  Anyway, I asked the waiter when this all started and he was dancing around saying we are a test Jack Astor's so a long time ago and it actually has a good reason.. I said oh yea? like what? before he said anything, I filled in the blanks and said is it because the wings will stay crispier? He said yea that's it.  Well, let me tell you, it got soggy real fast and the sauce seems to come straight from the fridge cause the wings became room temperature real quick.   IMO, the table side saucing is a gimmick to get the young servers to get more tips, shake and dance around and flirt.

Now the chicken BLT poutine was ahhh-mazing!!! It's poutine + buffalo chicken pieces + fries supreme.  This sounds soooo unhealthy and it probably is.  It also sounds weird right? But what a concept! It tastes so amazing!!!!

This place is always packed, but servers seem friendly and attentive.  The price is ridiculous though.  For 15 wings, its $20.99, the poutine was about $9.99.  I'm just surprised about the cost of those wings, they seem way jacked up.

I would have given this place a 2 star, but the chicken BLT poutine was sinfully delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible food.

I've never been a Jack Astor's fan but I was recently convinced to visit with some family members and all four of us were disappointed. We started with the garlic bread, one with cheese and one without, and found both to be gross, with too much raw-tasting garlic and too much butter. They also weren't served hot, but rather lukewarm.

I had the Hold the Beef burger, which I discovered was inedible after one bite. The non-patty ingredients were fine, but the black bean patty tasted incredibly burnt (????) and drenched in Southwestern spices that weren't described on the menu, and that didn't fit with the other components of the sandwich. I ended up taking out the patty with one bite removed and eating the vegetables and goat cheese. The server never questioned it, which was the one blip in the service - otherwise, our waitresses were personable and attentive, which is the reason for the second star.

The other dishes at the table - chicken and shrimp Pad Thai, the sesame chicken bowl, and the Holy Smoke BBQ Burger - were all incredibly mediocre, although not quite as bad. They were eaten because we were hungry and testy, but none of us were pleased.

I was offered a gift card after filling out the survey they give you but I'm not coming back here. It's been years since I've been to a Jack Astor's and it will be years more before I return."}
{"text":"i havent come here in a while but i did on a saturday night.
food was extremely average felt like the meals i could have made at home and better. feels like a bunch of highschool kids making your dinner to be honest. quality and presentation definately not there.  ive been to other jack astors that were so much better.... stamdard was not up to par.  unfortunate for a downtown high traffic area.

service was decent."}
{"text":"Went to watch the 2 soccer games playing at the same time. Luckily there were so many tv in the louge area so we can watch the games clearly~ ordered fries which came in a big portion and nobody can finish the whole thing even a guy."}
{"text":"I mainly went here because this Friday's-like chain carries a wide selection of hot sauces from my client, Melinda's, back in the states. That much alone makes me want to check this place out.

Service is pretty good. Maybe a little too over-friendly and irritating, but good. A mix-up with my burger order not just brought out an apology but also a complimentary basket of chips and salsa. Well, it made up for the fact I didn't get any at Hernando's earlier in the day. Chips were typical straight our of the bag chips and not a lot of salsa. I had to request more and they gave me two more cups. It's a chunky style salsa. Decent flavor, not a lot of bite as you might expect. At least they have mega hot sauces to mix in and correct that.

Burger was actually pretty good. Freshly made, it was thick and had a lot of flavor to it. More than some burger joints I've been to like the Counter, which kind of dry by comparison. Bun was weak and when I first received my burger, it thought it was smaller than half a pound but my eyes were deceived by the weak bun. Fries were good but nothing special.

Tried the house beer which was a lager. Decent taste but mostly similar to Molson's and Labatt's styles. Nothing you'd want to order again.

Dessert selection was smaller than I had expected and I was pretty full from all the chips anyway. So I skipped that.

Overall, better than most similar chains I've been to and I'd give it another shot. But I wouldn't run to it."}
{"text":"Worst jackastors ever. Had food in my hair engraved literally inside my food before I even began to eat. This happened to me TWICE...won't be going here again for sure!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, good efficient service, place looks good. Food was good and came out hot. We shared wings, nachos and some garlic cheese fries. I wasn't feeling my usual picky self. Ill give it another try for a real meal again since i felt neutral about it the first time but it's a nice go to place for drinks & finger food and hanging out."}
{"text":"I can't believe this has happened again to me and my son at this restaurant. I'm sick of these so called hostess who seat you at the kitchen because you are a white woman over the age of 50 and you have a white male who happens to be a little overweight. I asked to be moved, as the restaurant was not even half full (wonder why) and she flat out said NO. One minute later another hostess seats a boy about 14 and man about 40 in a booth that I asked for. Then they tell us there is no debit but we can use a credit card. UMMM, funny, the same machine is used for both. Well my friend, as this restaurant is obviously prejudiced against white people, I'll never go back to any Jack Astor's again. By the way, they've changed their menu and basically took all the good items off. Oh, Jack Astor, train your so called hostesses to do their jobs instead of this and teach them that the customer comes first, not a social conversation with each other."}
{"text":"Hard to pinpoint what is wrong with this place, probably because everything?  Place to catch up on a game, I suppose but only if you like highly priced crappy beer and miniature food items.  Food quality is processed and plainly awful, and the service is done by inexperienced teens who clumsily try and upsell at every turn.  

Steer clear, better options out there"}
{"text":"Aweful!  

I was surprised I could get a booking with such short notice during the holidays - was there today for lunch.  However I realize why it was half empty, it is really, really bad.  36.00$ for a lunch portion of Pad Thai and one beer.  

Service:   Slow and flighty - waiter seemed interested in trying to upsell and cross sell, telling us main courses will take awhile so we should order appetizers. Waiter took our drink order and spent 20 mins getting us beers, another 20 minutes before he took our food order and then 30 mins before any food came to the table. We had to threaten to walk out to get our bill, which was also problematic as there where problems on it.  we were a table of eight so the gratuity was included, guess this might explain the lack of service.

Food:  Portions were really small - I had the \"Big\" Bowel item which is really not that big, with pad thai that was borderline okay with tiny shrimp and 2 small pieces of chicken.  

Blah!  won't be back."}
{"text":"Typical jacks.  3 levels - bar on first level, dining area on second, and patio on top.  Servers were friendly.

Decent food.  Can't really screw up nachos

Good place to just chill with friends."}
{"text":"You don't go to Jack Astor's for the food.  'Nuff said.  But we had a group of 8, which included two young kids, so we figured it would be a good spot to go for our group.  

We got there around 6:30 on a Thursday.  We waited for about half an hour outside to get seated.  Okay, it was busy.  Then we go to order - get some pitchers of beer (for the adults, promise!) and the standard grub - fish 'n chips, bruschetta, caesar salad, burgers, kids meal entrees, and - erm - butter chicken.

After taking the drink orders they come out with the drinks... and for the two kids they serve their \"kids drinks\" (which come with the kids meals) in glasses.  Major spill waiting to happen, no?  We asked if they had any more kid-friendly cups.  They returned with the drinks in lowball glasses.  Fail.

Then it took a while for the food to come.  And the refills on soda just weren't coming.  Or on water.  As in, we'd ask, they'd say \"okay\" and then we'd wait and still no drinks.  

Then the food came... and we heard a crash.  Oops, they dropped two of our eight dishes.  And instead of coming over to apologize or even acknowledge it, our server just remained scarce.  We only realized it was the case when we saw butter chicken & fish n chips on the floor by the kitchen.  Fail.

Most of us were eating when my brother went to go to the bathroom.  And it was the one time the server didn't remain scarce.  Instead, when we weren't looking she took his half-eaten fish and got rid of it... even though he wasn't done yet.  Fail.

And the butter chicken?  According to my brother it had just a tiny amount of meat smothered in a whole lotta sauce.  He asked if this was normal and the server looked like a dear in the headlights, only answering \"um, yes\" after a long pause.

Why two stars, even?  Because there's even worse places in Toronto, and because the food was edible."}
{"text":"We got the herb shimp pasta.  My friend and I thought the same thing that it tasted so bland.  No flavour at all.I am not a chef but I think I can cook better pasta. The sauce in my plate was worse than those tomato pasta sauce in grocery store .  The Burger that my boyfriend had was good.  
About customer service, the hostess who tried to sit people was giving customers bad seats.  I don't know if the owner actually asked her to give customers all the bad seats first. not only us,  many people got bad seats too and they had to move.  It is not really a professional envorionment when waitresses was staying in a corner and joking loudly.  I know everybody should have fun in their work place but they have to be professional when it comes to expensive food."}
{"text":"I come to Jack Astors about once a year or so. What's great is that the menu is always changing. I'm never disappointed with what I order. Today I tried the chicken curry with low expectations. Surprisingly the flavour and spice was there. The jasmine rice was a little wet and sticky and not fluffy but with the sauce I didn't mind. The Brie burger was good, just wished the Brie slice was a little thicker. 
Overall a sure bet. Good service and it's clean."}
{"text":"Came here tonight before the Leafs vs Hurricanes game for a quick bite. It was crowded and we were told that it would be a 35 minute wait. Thinking that this was a reflection on the quality of food, my friend and I decided to bare the wait for a table. Completely unrelated to my experience here tonight, but .... this chain clearly tries to lure men mostly by having their predominantly female staff to be scantily clad. I am by no means a feminist, but... c'mon ladies.

I guess any day that there's a Leafs game, this place is busy. Nothing new so I'm surprised that this joint didn't anticipate this. Efficiency doesn't exist in the Jack Astor's Dictionary. What was irritating, was that I had to ask for water about four times and the food took ages to come. Don't they just unwrap the item from a wrapper and throw it into the oven?

Next time, I'll just grab some street meat by Union Station if I need a quite bite."}
{"text":"After an entire day of driving around the city, the friend and I ended up in Scarborough. We were starving so decided to go to the closest restaurant in sight. The winner - Jack Astor's. The last time I went to a Jack Astor's was in high school for a provincial election campaign party (reading in between the lines: I don't come here unless I have to). As it was four o'clock, there weren't too many patrons. We were quickly seated.

The food was below average. I ended up finishing everything on my plate, but this was purely due to the fact that I had not eaten all day. The perk (which seems to be the 'norm' for your local chains) is that soft drinks are bottomless. As a Diet Coke lover, I was in heaven.

The last time I checked, Jack Astor's is a family restaurant. Why did I feel as if I was visiting a gentleman's club? I'm sure the honchos in the office have enough money for bigger uniforms... please clothe your employees!"}
{"text":"Came here with my cousin because of it's patio that overlooks Dundas Square. We came in at around 1:30 and still had to wait for a table on the patio - I guess it's a known secret ! 

As we waited, we had drinks at the bar - I had the frozen mojito, which was quite tasty (especially with all the mint leaves in it). Luckily the wait wasn't too long and we were able to sit at a table within fifteen minutes. The menu is quite extensive here that it can be overwhelming. I ended up ordering the Chicken Pizza - a generous portion with a lot of spice to it. Service here was excellent - the crew are all very young and have a lot of positive energy. Our server was quick and attentive. The food is pretty average - nothing to write home about. Pricing here is pretty average - nothing is ridiculously expensive, but it's also not a cheap eat here. As Johnson C. recommends, I would only come here in the warmer months with Toronto visitors so that they can see Dundas Square. Not sure when I'll be back, but this place is perfect for a tourist to experience at least once when in Toronto.

Good for: out-of-towners, groups, casual dining"}
{"text":"This place made my eyes and ears bleed with pure frustration....

3 weeks already living in Canada and I am starting to figure out that there is not the kind of bar/pub culture that there is back home in Ireland. Unless it's a club then these places will always serve food. Correct me if I'm wrong but that's the impression I am getting. There doesn't seem to be just little pubs to go have a pint and a chat.

So after being to a few sports bar/restaurant type places I have realised that these kind of chain sports bar is the WORST type of place to be spending your dollars. Some are better than others but by Jaysus this has to be one of the worst.

The service was AWFUL. Granted the place was busy but every time our server was asked to bring us something it took 15 minutes at least. 

I had a Bloody Mary - it was standard enough. Then I ordered the pulled pork poutine. That was pretty good but a small enough portion. We drank some pitchers of beer and my friends had wings and a chicken salad. Again totally scabby on the portion size. [see pics]

This place is HUGE. Patio on the roof and a couple of other floors with tables and booths and then just the regular bar. Clinical mutant with no soul.

Our server and all the other servers were very very slow. There was no sense of urgncy with any of them. Granted it was busy but they seemed in no hurry to be going anywhere.

It seems like if you're relatively attractive female with a good figure then you are probably hired regardless of your experience.

I am gay. This little game of yours does not work for me. 

We left no tip. The only tip I would have given her was go find another job.

I had an enjoyable night due to the company I was with, but I know it most certainly had nothing to do with this place. I would be totally put off going to any of their other bars."}
{"text":"I always have a great time when I come here. Is usually it's a Saturday or Sunday for lunch. It's not too busy surprisingly at this time. Service is friendly and quick.

Love the take home freshly baked chocolate chip cookie. Will be back again."}

We had a table of 13 which we've reserved for, but we had to stand at the bar to wait for our table to fit our 13 guests; which took 15 minutes. Once seated, we were waiting for our non-alcoholic beverages for 20 minutes, took an additional 45 to actually order our food, took another 40 minutes to get our meals(where some meals came out cold), and when we were ready to pay, the server was no where to be found. No dinner should take more than 2 hours..... Yes we had a large group but it was not busy at all. Personally for any birthday celebrations in a large group, I won't recommend JA to any of my family or friends."}
{"text":"This certainly isn't the Jack Astors I remember going to back in the day on the east coast. This place has an uppity pretentious vibe when it's really just serving pub food and booze. The server didn't give a shit about providing service. She'd disappear for twenty minutes at a time and then come back to give sharp barking responses to any questions and huff away. I  had springs rolls for $8. The same as you'd get at any Asian place for half the price. Straight out of the freezer. I got bowtie pasta with chicken for $17 as the main course. I understand at a real restaurant $17 is a fine price for a pasta dish but you at least expect it to be cooked properly. The pasta was overcooked to the point it didn't even hold it's shape. Barely a sprinkle of chicken was provided. There was a distinct taste of uncooked booze in the dish which originally seemed to be coming from the sauce but could have also been from the sun-dried tomatoes which had an odd funk. To top it off it was under-salted. I don't feel the need to return."}
{"text":"This Jack Astor's location was decent enough. I had a Texan chicken sandwich which wasn't bad but at the same time, wouldn't draw me back. The restaurant was clean and the waiting staff were friendly enough. I wouldn't rush back here but if I was looking for a casual place to visit to eat I wouldn't say no to this place."}
{"text":"Went to watch Game 1 Raptors vs Cavaliers and the wait was not that bad- about 30 mins. 

My husband had the Smokin' Salmon ($22.76) : grilled Atlantic salmon, seven grain rice, charred tomatoes, avocado, smoky garlic sauce and jalapeño butter. 

It was really good, the salmon was done really well where it melts in your mouth, pretty impressed for Jack Astor's 

I had the Spicy Shrimp Fijitas ($21.81): Grilled peppers, onions, shredded lettuce, cilantro, sour cream, salsa, cheddar cheese and warm tortillas. 

It was not bad. The shrimps were big and juicy and not rubbery. The grilled veggies and shrimp were served on sizzling plate which was really good. The only down fall was the tortillas, they were warm but they were microwaved or steamed for too long that they stuck together and you had to peel them apart. 

Other than that, the service was pretty good even with the game on and the restaurant pretty busy."}
{"text":"Honnêtement la bouffe était extra et c'était propre! 2 étoiles de gagné... cependant la dame qui nous servais avant aucune façon elle n'était pas sympathique et elle a essayé de gonflé notre facture à deux reprises !! 

Soyez vigilant!!"}
{"text":"Nice girls and ok burger, that might be the only positive. I have been to this Jack Astor twice and despite JA's above average speed of service, it still remains average place to go with boring menu, lauzy beer and prices not coresponding to what you get on the plate."}
{"text":"Been here over 5 times, they either play super loud music, or it's fully quiet. Food is disgusting and loaded with fat.. Other times I tried to order, they were out of stock. Drink menu is bland, nothing special. 

The layout is quite good and they have a warmed up patio which gets packed during summer. Service is usually slow and our table did not get checked on again, this happened 80% of my visits here. 

Last time I was there, the waitress was cleaning the table I was sitting at which had bread crumbs... I don't know if they taught them to properly clean but she hurled the crumbs over the edge with the wet cloth over my lap!!! I was pretty pissed out esp wearing a dress. Please be careful next time ladies"}
{"text":"I'm a local. I feel like this should be a go to for me...  but the service is awful and the food mediocre... I've sat and waited almost 30 min for service without any server noticing me... there are so many great restaurants in the area that I don't think people should waste their time..."}
{"text":"Love this location, especially summer time when you get to dine on the patio. Service and staff were average during this visit.

Just got some dessert to eat today--these deep fried cheesecake spring rolls with strawberry and caramel dipping sauces--that tasted delicious. I tried the To-Tea-To drink jacked up which was kind of disgusting (I was hoping for it to taste more like a mojito but it didn't).

Anyways, although it wasn't the best visit I've had at this location, I love the area and service is usually good  so I'll come back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and really have nothing bad to say. Drinks are good, food is consistent with other locations, staff is friendly. 

I usually get the nachos and calamari which I always enjoy. Actually one of my favourite calamari  to eat in a restaurant. But like I said, I like those location as it's big, has lots of seating, and a decent patio for when it's warm outside.

I do wish they had mojitos on the drink menu because their version of it kind of sucks. Other than that all the other drinks I've had from here are good. I recommend their daiquiris and fishbowls. 

As long as the service and food stays great, I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"This location is decent. The only thing I like about this location more than others is the outdoor patio which is almost always impossible to be seated there without having to be put on a wait list. But anyway, it was the pride parade weekend so needless so say, it was packed and service was slow. We waited almost half an hour to just get a beer! 

I've been here a bunch of times but will probably refrain from coming when I know it will be busy."}
{"text":"I make a point to come to Jack Astor's every week because I honestly just can't get enough of that lobster and crab dip ! Besides the dip the excellent service always keeps me coming back ! The staff there is super friendly and they are very informative about the menu, and are always willing to make adjustments/substitutions for us to make sure that we are satisfied ! 
I usually opt for the dip or the beer cheese soup but every once in a while I like to try items on their seasonal menu. This time I got the pulled pork poutine to share with my friend and it was very tasty. The only complaints is that it did not come out all that hot and it had mustard on it (which does not go with poutine in my opinion) but it was still delicious and I would definitely try it again (asking for no mustard next time). 
For dessert I always get the lemon concoction, it has lemon, sprite and vanilla ice cream (don't knock it till you've tried it) it was a recommendation from one of the servers and I have not looked back since !"}
{"text":"Terrible Service.  My group arrived at the restaurant slightly before Noon on a Friday.  It took more than 30 minutes before they were ready to take our orders.  It took another 40 minutes before the food arrived and most of the orders were wrong.  We finished our lunch as soon as possible so that we can get back to work but it took them another 30 minutes to deliver our bills.  We ended up couldn't leave the restaurant until 2:10.  We complained to the Manager and she acted like that was normal.  The restaurant was not even busy, only about 20% of the tables were occupied.  We were a big group (16 of us) but we booked the table 2 weeks in advance.  There were no reasons why they couldn't do a better job serving us, except poor management."}
{"text":"Jack Astor's has the best bruschetta ive ever had. However, when I went in today, the goat cheese was super salty. It was still finished. Ordered the sirloin steak with veggies and mashed potatoes. The mash potatoes had some kind of radishes in it that completely dominated the steak and veggies. It was not enjoyable at all. The veggies and steak were very good though. I always order medium rare and get exactly that. My mother paid on her credit card and accidently tipped our waitress $2.00 on a $40.00 bill. After the transaction went through, hertone was rude, she thanked us in a very off tone manner and walked away. My mother is
Completely obliviously to this kinds thing. Never the less, my mom left an additional $5 for her because of the honest mistake she made. We went after lunch time and it wasn't busy. The service aside from the fake 'thank you, enjoy your day' for the mistaken short tip at first, was overall good and the food could have been better. Id still come back to this location."}
{"text":"Came here today for a Friday lunch-out, and boy was it so hard to find a spot in such a busy plaza! 

Anyways, food here is priced higher than average but I find there is nothing too special about the quality of food they serve. 

Wait time is brutal during busy lunch hours.

Their drinks are somewhat good. I find their servers are very friendly though.

I see how people choose this restaurant due to its location and the ambiance. Over-all just okay.

{"text":"The service here was great!  We had about 8 people at our table and sat outside.  We never had to keep asking for anything.  We even got two free beers.  I will definitely go back here the next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"I came to this location for dinner during the week! I had my favourite thing on the menu: sauced up chicken fingers with a Caesar salad on the side. We also had the chicken sandwich which is fairly new on the menu (I believe)... it basically tastes like a chicken grilled cheese sandwich, it wasn't great. Our waiter barely checked up on us to see if we were okay so we had to get help from other waiters which was annoying. Overall I love this location so I hope for a better experience next time :)"}
{"text":"Jack Astor's has been a staple of this community

Their new menu is delish

The guac is a good starter though they should be mashing down the avocado a bit more

But the real deal is the wings 

Hand tossed in the sauce is so much better

Had the sesame ginger wings...

Wow is all I gotta say

Service was great there

Keep doing what you do!!!"}
{"text":"I still come here to meet up with friends as it can provide a friendly and warm sports atmosphere to catch up over a few drinks and food.

Though I do feel that the price of food on the menu at Jack Astor's has not kept pace with the actual value you get for the monies in my opinion. I ordered the burger and fries and it just really looked really boring and lacklustre. 

The beer menu and prices are still pretty decent with the option to up-size it to a Jack Astor's size for another buck or two.

It's an a-ok place to go when you're trying to meet the needs of a large group, accessible location, or to catch a sports game or two."}
{"text":"A friend and I had decided to do some shopping at Scarborough Town Centre and then dine somewhere different other than the mall's food court. We decided on the Jack Astors' location which is just outside of the mall. We were greeted with a friendly smile, and didn't have to wait too long for our food which has usually been the case at some of their other locations. Our host was super friendly, personable and was able to answer any questions I had when I decided to try something new off their menu. The atmosphere was nice, and not once did I feel bothered or pestered. Our host checked up on us a few times rather than bugging us every few seconds. The food was delicious and fresh as usual, and we felt more welcomed at this location! I'll be back there without a doubt!"}
{"text":"A good friend of mine told me about this place and dragged me here. I must say that I am happy they did. On the outside it looks like a typical sports bar and grill, but it's definitely not. This place is much better than that. The atmosphere and vibe of this place is what sets it apart from many other similar places I've been. The employees here are super nice, they all wear these shirts with funny messages on the back. When you start to look around you will see funny posts hanging on the walls. I guarantee that you will laugh at a few of them. 
Asides from the great service and fun atmosphere, the food is great. I definitely enjoyed myself here. This place has definitely got it down on how to keep people coming back. Definitely recommend giving this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Même si c'est une chaîne comme beaucoup en amérique du nord, j'ai vraiment aimé ce restaurant!

Le restaurant n'est pas loin de la CN tower donc parfait pour le touriste qui a faim et ne sait pas trop ou manger! Il est sur 2 étages, je conseille le RDC qui est plus calme car le 1er étage fait plus ambiance soirée match de hockey (alors que nous y sommes allés à midi!). L'ambiance générale est très sympa, musique, pas trop forte donc parfait, écrans de télé a ne plus savoir ou regarder et une déco très sympa!

Le menu est très abordable, et vraiment bon! Bon pas de la cuisine 4 étoiles mais je n'ai pas été décue... le bacon grillé un vrai bonheur.
Le service était parfait, on ne vient pas nous voir toutes les 2 minutes mais la serveuse fait toujours attention à ce que vous ne manquiez de rien.

Intéressant pour ceux qui ne boivent pas: les POP sont en refill."}
{"text":"Went there for a friend's birthday. About 7 of us ordered these fish bowl drinks for about $14 each.  I just wonder how much alcohol went in to these drinks because not one of us got a buzz considering how big these drink were.  Tried this Jack's epic burger from the feature menu where it has a thick crispy deep fried provolone patty in it was good.  The only thing I didn't like about it was the overabundance of red onion that was on it.  Felt like it was half a red onion worth on my burger so I just removed the excess.  Will go back for the food but not ordering fish bowl drink again."}
{"text":"Totally sketchy asian server with bald head...\"jacks\" up my pint without telling me to increase the bill ...and no. .not being racist. ..I'm asian myself (korean)"}
{"text":"Location here is squished between other stores, it's convenient location tho at Yonge and Bloor, Yorkville,  walk down to the Eatons Centre on Yonge St. 

Patio outside is pretty small, can't blame them tho, they don't even have room to add more. Lighting outside at night is way toooooooo dark, my friends sitting across from me near the plant bushes couldn't read the menu. 

We came here after the MTV live taping at 10pm. We just ordered drinks and one app. The bill in total was below $50. 

The drinks, all priced around $6-7 dollars 

Mango Sapphire Jackerita 
Mango Raspberry Twist, 
Piña Colada
Blue Raspberry Lemonade? 

All drinks were pretty good but would've tasted better with less chunky bits of ice, they didn't mix it well. Jack up your drink aka add another shot to you'r drink for a few extra $$, 2 ish bucks. 

The Spinach, Artichoke and goat cheese dip was amazing as my friend said. They give free nacho chip refills :)"}
{"text":"First time here, from Chicago and was really excited to have a few cocktails and some appetizers.  For starters, my husband ordered Johnny Walker with a splash of coke and I ordered a sparkling cocktail which is called \"Drunken Passion Fruit\".  In come the drinks and my husband gets a glass with a little bit of Johnny Walker and a tiny carafe with thee flattest coke ever and NO ICE!!! Who gets you a drink and then doesn't give you ice?!?! I taste my drink and it's ALL SUGAR.  No fizzy sparkling anything, just juice.  The waitress then says \"I've never seen a drink served this way, it must be because we have a new bartender\"...REALLY?!?? If you've never seen it that way then why bring it to us??? No apology but we did get a HUGE...ATTITUDE! No thank you John Astor's.

I'm going to finish my champagne glass full of molasses and be on my way.  I will never come back here."}
{"text":"when I walked up to the door, there was a homeless man standing there asking everyone for money. The hostess wouldn't let me in with my coffee cup from Tim Hortons... I had to either dump it out or try to chug it. Which I guess I understand to a certain extent but I told the host I would buy another drink plus my meal and he was not interested... I ended up ordering the pad Thai bowl and it was mediocre at best... I will not come back to the restaurant"}
{"text":"Surreal!  Had the guacamole and almost chocked on a bread tag that was mixed inside it!   Pretty unbelievable- I was in shock when a waitress took the bread tag out of my hand before I could snap a pic.  Don't really trust the kitchen anymore and upon examining the bar area- this place is dirty.   Very disappointing- like out of a movie feeling...  Staff was ok about it -paid our tab- but we won't be going back or recommending it- perhaps if they had of given us a voucher or something...but it was more like a sucks for you kinda vibe.  Pretty jackass indeed!!"}
{"text":"We came here for a bite to eat after a hectic day at metro convention centre. 
We understood that it was really busy so the waitress was a bit slow to coming back for our orders and refills on water etc.

As we were ordering I explained to her that I have a Student discount card and showed her. She told me that it was not valid during this time and that it would be hard for her to find a manager to apply the discount. AND also that it would apply to only one meal. ok...so that's fine but why is it so hard to apply a discount to our bill? I found it a bit rude that it was that hard to do that. I mean I understand that it's busy but at least try..

Food was really good, just majorly disappointed with the waitress' attitude towards how finding a manager to add a discount was off the discussion table."}
{"text":"So, normally, I would have written a great review on Jack Astor's queensway,  but, not this time.  From the server taking forever to even get our drink order, to my hamburger,  now 2 small patties for quicker cooking, and my cold fries on the side, I was very disappointed in Jack Astor's Queensway.  Probably won't be heading there anytime soon."}
{"text":"I used to come here regularly but now not so much. The drinks are always a bit off.  Either too much liquor or not enough. The chicken fajitas have always been my favorite as well as the bruschetta."}
{"text":"Love eating here... great place for wings, watching the sports game, hanging out with friends, or ordering to go.

I really enjoyed the \"curling game\" in the back..:) lolol good fun after a good dinner.:)

I'll be back again... SOON"}
{"text":"All I can say is, living by this Restaraunt is amazing.
Easy place to meet friends, have a drink, watch the game or play Curling..:) lolol YES, curling, inside the restaurant lolol (you'll find out when you go for a visit..:)

Great place and the food is good.:)"}
{"text":"Idk if it's because of the fact that this place is was in Toronto, but it was 10x better than the Jack Astor's at the Galleria Mall. The atmosphere was LIVE and the food was fantastic. The prices were extremely fair. Definitely on my list of grub spots when visiting T.O.!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a great fan of dim and tacky bar and grill franchises...

However, this one has a nice patio, perfect for a cold beer on a sunny day. Sadly it was packed when we went there... So we were seated inside...

To top it off, I had a long hair in my salmon salad and the waiter was trying to cover it up... We just ordered the check and left..."}
{"text":"My Wife and I love it here. We were greeted right away from the lovely staff at the door. Seated right away and was served by an awesome waiter named Gelly.
  We ordered apps, the usual awesomeness called the bruschetta, to die for. As well as the veggie Mucho Nachos with guacamole yummerific.
  The Mains were Chicken Parm and I got the Smiling Buddha salad....I would definitely get this salad again. Chicken breast with strawberries,pecans,apples....incredible.."}
{"text":"The service here is pretty bad. Our waitress was friendly, but I guess she got off work halfway through because she disappeared. It's also very loud in here and hard to talk. 

I ordered the Korean BBQ skewers and my boyfriend got the New York Steak Frites. We also got some wings with the sauce on the side. The skewers were too spicy and had a strange flavor, the steak was alright, and the fries were probably the best thing we had. The wings tasted pretty bad. Also, about 5 minutes into eating after being served, a waitress came and took the plate I was eating on... didn't even ask if I wanted it gone (which I obviously didn't since my food was on it??) and said \"I'll take this out of your way\". LOL. 

I'm sure other locations are nice, but this one just seems a bit off. Wouldn't recommend coming to this one."}
{"text":"The patio was nice and the music playing was delightful. The food was ok.

I went with my girlfriend and I don't know if it's common, but on the table right next to ours there was a couple of really loud people, some of them seemed to be employees on break. It was 6 pm, and there wasn't a game on tv or anything like that. They were bothersome the whole time, seemed really drunk, screaming and clapping really loud, ignoring all the people around. I hope this doesn't happen frequently."}
{"text":"This actual restaurant by Square One has got to be the absolute worst ONE of jack astors locations. The server Amy is downright rude. Has a very abrasive personality that is more suited for a bar in Sudbury or something. Her lack of service skills were demonstrated tonight. The food was terrible. The manager has her work cut out for her in order to turn this place around. I'm not surprised it only has 3 stars. It should have 1. If that. Very bad location. Poor food. Poorer service. You're better off going to a McDonalds. There are just too many great restaurants to settle for foolish behaviour from a server. And crappy food. That's all!"}
{"text":"We had a table of six and waited for twenty minutes and no one stopped by our table once. No we weren't rowdy. I tried getting a server to come by our table and they would literally walk right past us and we all wanted to purchase food. Never been treated so poorly, never ever go to this site."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place looking for Tony Roma's (which is now closed). Much more reasonably priced than other restaurants in the area. We had two burgers, two beers, the chicken salad entree and a BBQ chicken pizza. 

Positives: The pizza is a large size, easy to share between two people. 
Gluten free buns available for burgers but as usual the buns are smaller so the whole burger seemed smaller. The entire plate with the side of fries was not as filling.
The salads are good portion size, the amount of meat was more than expected.
The tables have paper that you can draw on, fun idea and something to do when waiting for food and drinks. 
Good oldies music and atmosphere
Good service, very attentive 

Pros: The food is very salty and I suspect msg on the fries, I always get a headache from msg and extremely dry mouth which happened after my meal.

Would recommend this restaurant and will be returning next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Really good food. Great atmosphere. The servers were very attentive, which is always a plus. Kid friendly, music, tv's, all positives in my book! Plenty of seating. Great views of you decide to sit on the balcony. An extensive menu with plenty to pick from. 

The bread, the drinks, the food appetizer and main course were all good. We celebrated with shots which is always fun....what we're we celebrating....Saturday. lol. 

Stop in some time."}
{"text":"Came to this location because nothing else was open around. I had the smokey jalapeno burger. 

The burger tasted weird. 

The nachos were standard fare.

The fries were awesome.

Like the paper table cloths."}
{"text":"Ya gotta love jacks at Xmas time

Festive,  busy, fun vibe and still great service even if it's a large group of people

You will love the Texas Roadkill Chicken sandwich - a juicy grilled chicken breasts with guacamole , mayo, lettuce, tomato and zesty red onion   fries with gravy please

They have upped their menu and expanded their beer offering

Check out the new jacks menu"}
{"text":"Underwhelming. Decided to sit on the patio first and after a while I realized I'm looking at cars and a concrete wall and listing to some generator noise near by, I decided to go in instead.

I ordered lunch quesadillas and the portion was tiny. It was cut into 4 pieces. I opened one and it had two tiny pieces of chicken in it. Probably in ounce of chicken in total in the entire meal. Meal wasn't very tasty and the waitress provided very uninspired service, going through  motions and not really caring.

Not coming back - so many better choices within a block. Food is overpriced and I guess they're trying to be fancy by ending food prices with odd random cent amounts such as .32, .63 and .02"}
{"text":"I watch the most recent leafs and bruins game here. nice atmosphere, cool crowd, and lots of canadian national pride. :) i'm not a hockey fan but that was a very awesome game!

i tried the cider on tap - awful, think im going back on strongbow. nachos was mediocre, you basically get a plate of chips with hardly any topping.  nothing special really. We decided to go down the street and have a fish burrito afterwards to fill our tummies."}
{"text":"I like this particular location as it is just up the street from one of my fave movie theatres, Scotiabank (aka Cineplex). Service is always friendly and efficient, and when me and my friend are in a rush to not miss a movie (as we often come here beforehand), the servers are accommodating when we ask for the bill early. and food always tasty..I usually get the Chicken Club pizza, minus the lettuce (who would want lettuce on a pizza anyhoos lol?). Good sized outdoor area as well."}
{"text":"A typical Jack Astor's experience - burgers and beer. 

The server was really chatty, and couldn't take the hint that we are discussing business, and would like to resume our conversation. At the same time she was just being friendly, so no hard feelings.

Otherwise, given the lack of normal watering holes in that part of downtown Toronto, it is always open season - the place is large and clean.

Will repeat, if necessary."}
{"text":"It's a Jack Astor's - enough said. If you come there having expectations - you are in the wrong place.

It is a bar, with typical bar fare. Had a beer, had some food. The food was nothing to write home about, the beer, well, it was beer.

The server was super friendly, so overall a good experience, but as the food was bland, a rating of more than 3 stars would be overdoing it.

Will repeat if I had to."}
{"text":"We were a party of 3 on a Friday night of a long weekend so obviously this place was packed. 

Very good service, accommodating and doting. They made a mistake with our order (they forgot to bring out 2 out of 3 of the main meals) so that was a little ridiculous. My main meal sat there cooling for 10mins before the other plates came out SO they remade my meal. Because of this fiasco, they comped our garlic bread appetizer and our dessert without us complaining. 

My Italian burger (with the balsamic reduction on the side) was perfection. So delicious and so we're the sweet potato fries. The garlic bread with cheese is to die for. Their drinks are huge and yummy, I got the blue raspberry slushy drink. 

The doughnut bite dessert was not up to par, reminded us of day old Tim bits with overly sweet dipping sauces. But this place is always loud and fun - great for groups if you're on the south shore."}
{"text":"Super convenient location right at the heart of Yonge and Dundas square, but a bit hard to find the entrance (go all the way up the escalators to the top floor, next to Milestones). The venue is pretty big inside and has a heated patio with a great view of Yonge Dundas square.

Food and value- 2/5 at most. Pretty basic pub food, unhealthy, and very overpriced. Items on the lunch menu hover around $11-18 while regular/dinner entrees are over $18. We ordered regular and sweet potato fries for the table, which were pretty small size, but enough for 1 person as an appetizer. The nachos shared platter was huge and came with sour cream, guac, and pdg. Don't order any of the battered fried meats - suuuuper basic and small/overpriced. The salads were impressive though, relative to everything else on the menu. As a pescatarian who wanted to avoid dairy since I forgot to bring Lactaid, I had a hard time finding edible things on the menu. I eventually ordered the Ahi Tuna Mango Avocado salad, which also came with crispy tortilla chips. The tuna was kind of bland, but fatty and I liked it. The grilled chicken salads also looked impressive.

Service- 3/5. Today we came with a large group, so gratuity was already included at 16%, which is standard but unfortunate today because the service that we received was very mediocre at best. I guess they have a lot of newcomer staff recently because service was very slow and disorganized - our waters remained empty for most of the meal, orders and the bill took a long time to come, and we literally had to chase down our waiter for service despite the venue being rather empty at around 3PM. At one point, 6 hostesses were standing beside our table, but none of them could help us and they forgot to relay the message to our actual server that we needed service. Pros: when service was present, they were very friendly and professional.

Won't be back again unless I have to."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from this restaurant and have walked by their patio many times.   I pretty well knew from the customers I saw on the patio, as to what the food would be like.  Never tried it though, but a while ago I was given a gift card and decided to try it on my way home last night.   I was craving a steak, so ordered their classic with a side of vegetables and a glass of pinot noir.   The meal arrived fairly quickly and was presented very well.   Both the veg. and steak were cooked to perfection.  My only complaint is that the meat was not very good at all, too much gristle, like trying to eat chewing gum.   From looking around I get the impression that this is the type of restaurant that would appeal to young people looking for a drink and nibbles after work.  Just don't order the steak."}
{"text":"We went there to celebrate my friend's birthday. We ordered the signature dish Hamburger with smoked bacon and spicy sauce and also the tuna salad. Food was good. The tuna tastes fresh and the hamburger is juicy. The portion was good for its pricy and the service was pretty fast unlike other reviews, we guess it was because we are on Sunday that there was not too many customers at this point."}
{"text":"Oh...Jack Astors!

Brings back the many high school memories of movies and dinners, birthday parties with singing wait staff, waiting with that red buzzer forever and lollipops! Somehow besides their pan bread and nachos I don't remember much else about their food. 

They did start doing craft beer a few summers ago because BF and my first date was a beer on a cold September patio. 

Went back for an actual meal last week with his parents and we sat at the bar instead of waiting for a table on Family Day= smart move!

Two burgers, 1 salad and a fajita bowl was ordered. 

I enjoyed the fries a lot (crispy, not overly tasting like oil)

My entree of the bowl was pretty good, the beans, veggies, brown rice and avocado made a great combination. The server was friendly even though I changed my mind after ordering. Everyone got a different beer and no complaints there either. 

I wish they had some vegan options on the menu, but I was able to create a veggie option by ordering the steak bowl with the steak on the side. Better than a plate of nachos for dinner :/

Yay for the craft beers and the renos in the bar but the tables and chairs are too close together!

Still holds a dear spot in my heart and I think I'll try to visit again in the summer on their patio!"}
{"text":"This review probably doesn't represent what a regular trip here would be like, but if you're considering booking for a large group, perhaps my experience will be of value.

Jack Astor's has a deal with Laser Quest to get a discount off group bookings when you go to both places, so a friend of mine took this package and 18 of us showed up for dinner on a Sunday. Now, I understand a group of this size can create some headaches, but as someone who used to work in the restaurant industry, I've also seen how many places specifically prepare for tasks like this, so it SHOULD be rather difficult to catch them as off-guard as we seemed to, especially given that it was scheduled quite some time in advance.

I was one of the last to arrive, getting there about 10 minutes after most of the others, and most had their drinks already, which is fine... but it did take quite some time for anybody to even bother to take my order, and then a completely ridiculous ammount of time before my drink actually arrived at the table.

From there, a pattern began to form: great product, poor execution.

The first course saw us choosing one of four options: a garden salad (with one of 5 or 6 dressings), a cesar salad, a red pepper bolognaise soup and a beer & cheddar soup, and the reviews seemed to be fairly positive across the board. I for one had the garden salad with blackberry vinagrette dressing and it wasn't overwhelming by any means, but was alright as a starter. This course, however, was a chore in that they had 3 different servers come out and take orders, and about 15 minutes later came out with a SINGLE soup. By the time the person who'd order it had finished we hadn't seen a single other dish. Once they had stared at their empty bowl for almost 10 minutes, the friend who organized the event actually went up to the bar to complain and was told \"they're making the others\". This seems to be rather poor service, when it takes that long to \"make\" salads and scoop out soups, but even THEN one would think serving all at once should be standard practice. When the rest finally did come out, we had 3 extras of one type of salad and mine was nowhere to be seen... it wasn't until a woman who appeared to be some kind of manage noticed I hadn't been served yet asked again what I'd ordered, that it finally came about 5 minutes later so I'm assuming it had been completely forgotten and had to be made again.

With the group booking, we had a different menu to order from than the standard and only had 3 options for the main course, two of which were standard menu items (the Brie Chicken and a Salmon dish) and then had a third option appararently concocted by the chef specifically for our event - a 7 ounce sirloin steak on a bed of blue cheese mashed potatoes and topped with a sort of slaw of spinach, onion and red pepper. This is what I had, minus the blue cheese and I have to say this was quite well executed. The steak was delicious, as were the potatoes.... but yet again, this course was riddled with poor service as servers scrambled around for several minutes trying to match plates with the people they belonged to and we found extras of one dish and too few of another, etc.

Finally came dessert where we were given only one option, the very aptly named \"World's Smallest Brownie\", in which they take a brownie different in shape but similar in size to the \"2 bite brownies\" you can by en mass in a bag or rubber tub at a local grocery store, but placed on the same sized plate that your dinner is on, further accenting just how tiny this thing really is, with a small dollup of whipped cream beside it, and the plate drizzled in caramel sauce. The brownie was very rich and tasty, but I was glad to hear it only costs $1 on the regular menu, because you'd have to order at least 4 of these to get a \"real\" dessert. Once again, we somehow ended up with extras but this was the one time where this wasn't a problem as they were eagerly snatched up.

All in all it seems the kitchen staff were on point. Every dish was met with positive reactions. It's just a shame that, even with 3-4 servers attending to our table at any given time (probably a total of at least 6 over the course of the night) nothing on the service end seemed to go as planned. If booking an event well in advance can't make a ship run smoothly... what can?"}
{"text":"This Jack's nestled in the entertainment district is sitting in a converted house and it may look small from the outside but trust me it's very large inside. I've been here for many at work lunch dates with my co-workers and this is the favourite. It's got a great patio and even upstairs has a door that opens to the outside during gorgeous weather. 

The service is superb and the food is top notch. I don't think I've eaten at a better tasting Jack Astor's, so it is true, everything tastes better in downtown Toronto, especially for franchises.

The decor is like your typical Jack's with the black leather seating and dark wooden chairs with a few exceptions of crazy LED screens climbing the wall opposite the downstairs bar to the upstairs bar and of course the numerous screens placed everywhere showing some hilarious clips of what looks to be ghetto style America's Funniest Home Videos.

Great place for some work lunch dates or even after work drinks as they do have cheap drinks during happy hour and TONS of place to sit and/or stand and chat with a bunch of friends."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Jack Astors for a long time.  I went there recently and was pleasantly surprised how much it has changed in the last 10 years.  It seems to be more upscale, more mature in terms of decor and atmosphere, yet the food is still fun while vastly improved in terms of quality and offerings.

I decided to try the Holy Smokes BBQ Burger.  It was awesome.  Just as good as the Montana's burger I mentioned in that review.  It was huge, tasted great, loaded with cheese, bacon, breaded fried onions, hot peppers, etc.  Was great!  Great presentation and quality.  Everyone at the table had the same experience with what they ordered.  Service was great as well."}
{"text":"Thought I would venture outside of the typical burgers and fries and it was a bad idea. Got the pasta and it tasted like a canned sauce pasta from a bad frozen dinner with a few shrimp on top. 

Note to self: Stick to their sweet potatoes and burger."}
{"text":"Service is fine but as a veg person the options here pretty much suck. Especially the pasta sub tofu, it's always dry when I order it (has been 3+ times now)"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Very friendly staff. They did not have a veggie burger on the kids menu but we were accommodated from the adult menu for the same price!"}
{"text":"Was a go to place for years got tired of the menu so stopped going. Seen some new items decided to go back, food was okay but our server was great and friendly. They had a special of 1lb of free wings after 5 for each guest which was amazing. They were pretty good but that's a lot of free food, we got there around 4:30 my friend was ordering 2lbs of wings waitress went out of her way to say order a pound and bring out the other lb after. Good job."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the more positive experiences at a Jack Astors restaurant. I came here with my softball team won the championship. The restaurant is quite large and has lots of seating. Server was great. The restaurant was pretty good with accommodating 20 of us in the group. I know Jack Astor's is a chain restaurant but they do have decent food. I ordered the steak frites with the parmesan fries. Food came out quickly. The steak was nicely cooked, seasoned well and quite delicious. Fries were alright. The waitress was great. She was constantly checking on her table and she was pretty good with our group even though at times we got pretty rowdy at the back. She was good at ensuring we had enough drinks and kept giving me refills of coke without me asking. Overall, a great location to have dinner. Lots of parking and a popular plaza in Richmond Hill. Would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"It was an OK place. I came in during a rain storm and sat at the bar. It was so dark I couldn't read the menu. It was so loud that I couldn't hear the server. There was a door behind me and every time someone left I'd get a draft of that cold/wet air, I should have moved but was just glad to get in and sit. The food was OK, the draft beer was OK, nothing great for either."}
{"text":"Great sports bar had a meeting with my staff and loved the wings, nachos, and dippers. Supper friendly staff."}
{"text":"We came with a large group here for a Sunday lunch after the Sportinglife 10K. The food is not bad and it's a decent place in a great location for some simple eats. You're not going to be blown away but the convenience will be hard to beat. 

We got the classic burger which was a double patty on a brioche bun with the normal veggies. The beef patty was really good here but the size of the burger was a bit underwhelming. The house salad was also good here and the croutons were herbed and massive. The blackberry balsamic is a really good dressing by the way; the sweetness of the berry emulsifies with the acidity of the balsamic. We also tried the 'California style' beef nachos that arrived on a two foot board. It was essentially nachos laid out in a line with these huge rectangular tortilla chips that can hold a lot of toppings. I didn't think it was worth it but there was a huge amount of lettuce and toppings. I'm not sure if the fried garlic slices were a good idea as it tasted a bit burnt and soggy. Also, the nachos could have used more salsa and sour cream as they were a tad on the dry side. Personally I'd recommend getting the regular nachos over these as you would not only get more nachos for the money but a more hefty one as well. However if you're looking for nachos with lettuce, then get the board nachos.     

Some people in our group ordered the chicken strips and the fish n chips, and they looked a lot better than I was expecting! Service was friendly and attentive, and our lunch was quite quiet which was a surprise being a bar and grill."}
{"text":"I met a work collegue here for a pint and an appetizer before I headed off to theatre. The place was packed with Maple Leaf fans prior that evening's match with the Bruins. All that was fun to watch, although the only really available space was out in the coolish outdoor patio.

The propane space heaters weren't really doing a complete job and neither did the service.  Wait staff were pleasant and friendly enough, but that couldn't make up for the rest of our marginal \"dining\" experience. It took 10-15 minutes for our round of beers to come out and even longer for my marginal chicken quesadilla order.  My collegue faired a litlle better with the pizza, but neither of us was impressed."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Very slow service, the drinks were watery and the food was not even mediocre. I don't know if this is typical of the chain or just this location but we will not be returning to Jack Astors."}
{"text":"Compared to other jack astors that i have been to throughout the city my experience in this location wasnt that good. I have been here twice and got my usual appetizer the cheesy bread and my medium new york steak. Start of with the bread. I could tell it wasnt as fresh as i would expect due to my previous experience at other locations. It tasted like it was heated up in the microwave. Now for the steak it wasnt that hot when i got it and it was cooked at the wrong temperature. I got it medium rare rather than medium. Service wasnt special too. Would try not to go there anymore."}
{"text":"Beautiful location, but had couple of disadvantages. Went there on Victoria day at around 12am .. We were three people and wanted to be seated on the patio but the hostess told us that is was full and there was no room at all so we had to get a table inside meanwhile there was atleast 5 tables empty and had no customers for the time that we stayed there .. Food came out at reasonable timing but the appetizers and the main dishes came out only 5 mins apart.. I had the american burger that was really good but the fries were kind of cold and not fresh... Overall would go back again for the beautiful location and view.."}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way to panama, we had a 10 hour layover and the cabbie suggested the restaurant. The atmosphere is fun and inviting with a gorgeous patio to sit in. Those are the pros.  When we arrived we were seated immediately and when our waitress, cinnamon, took our drink orders she didn't come back for 20 minutes. 4 beers and a coke in a quiet restaurant.  Another 20 minutes and she came back so we could finally order. Food was burnt and terrible. I would suggest the steakhouse  next door. Avoid this restaurant at all costs."}
{"text":"- pleasant atmosphere
- convenient location
- worst prime rib ever, served cold, not really something you can cut vs ripping apart
- great Caesar salad
- mediocre service - server didn't pick up on the fact we didn't eat our dinner"}
{"text":"Been to this place three times last night being the last time and 2 out of three left very disappointed.
The first time I said it might have been a busy day or a new server but when this happened again yesterday I am done with this place.

Cocktail was spilled on my jeans and jacket by the server and a very simple apology was offered.
(This part is an accident and I was still in a good mood)

Then their interact machines were down and we waited over 30 minutes to pay and at the end they didn't even know how to use the old fashioned manual machines!

Terrible"}
{"text":"In the suburbs I live near a Jack Astor's that we have regularly been going to for years and have been happy with.    Working downtown I've also been to some of the other established Jack Astor's in downtown Toronto.

One of the reasons why you go to a chain restaurant is because you  have better assurances and expectations.    This was my first time here and the place and service made me question all of that.   My friends when I arrived already complained about not being served, and when I got there several waitstaff came around but avoided eye contact and did not ask if we'd like to order anything despite everyone holding a menu.

Finally someone came around but by that time we we had enough and decided to
take the earlier train home rather than spend anymore money than we had to
at this place.   I'm hoping that this was just localized to this location, since most other restaurants in this chain have been great to us."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the past month or so.  Most recently on a  Saturday evening for dinner and drinks.  We really wanted a seat on the patio and after a short wait, we were lucky enough to get one.  

Over the course of the evening we ordered jacked up icebergs, the sloe gin Collins and tanquerays and soda.  All the drinks were good.  Though the iceberg (mango) could have been a little sweeter, but that's just me.  For dinner I had the topless steak sandwich with sweet potato fries and my friend had the ribs with corn on a cob and sweet potato fries.  Both were delicious, I was actually surprised that the food was as good as it was.  My steak was cooked to perfection and the spicy chipotle mayonnaise that came with the sweet potato fries was addictive!

Overall, nice evening, not terribly expensive, about $90 between the two of us.  We also met some nice folks as we sat there enjoying our dinner, which always makes for a pleasant evening.

I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I have to say this place has it all.  Great food, amazing drinks, and a wall of tvs to watch sports on.  I went during lunch and wish I had found this gem before the end of my two week business trip.  If you get the chance to make it down there I would recommend asking for Lana as not only was her suggestions top notch but the conversation was as great as the food.  Make it down to this location as you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is one of our usual spots! When we can't think of anything else to do, we can always come here to grab some food, a drink, and watch the game. The only problem is the inconsistency.

On some days, we get seated at a nice booth, directly beside a TV so we can watch the game, and our night goes great. On other nights, we get seated where we have to squint to catch the game, and it gets quite annoying.

You see Jack Astor's all over the city, and just like every location, this one ins't special. 3/5."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I went to Jack Astors the other day. Their updated menu is actually not bad looking, I got the veggie burger and it was amazing. It's thin, topped with goat cheese and bruschetta, just so great. The burger itself was a little dry but everything else was perfect. The fries are also really tasty!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst experience I had! The alcoholic drinks taste more like water!! They deliver half of ur food portion and then 30 min later deliver the other half portion which I assumed fell down accidentally cuz they rush and short on staff!! My Food was burnt I didn't even bother complaining! They killed my Sunday vibes!! I bet manager care less if they even have one"}
{"text":"I came here on a school night with a couple of my girls (shh don't tell my mom, I was supposed to be studying!) to catch up over a couple of bevvies.

It was just ok. Our drinks came at different times and my friend's caesar was \"really gross\" so she asked it to be re-made. She said it was just as \"gross\" as the first time. I didn't order anything to eat (t'was full) but the girls both settled on fish and chips, which they said were decent.

For some weird reason, I ordered the same pint as my first for my second but it tasted totally different?? Didn't care to bring it up but it was odd, dude.

I wouldn't rush back to Jack's but it is absolutely conveniently located in DT."}
{"text":"Normally, I'm kind of skeptical about Jack Astor's. It's mostly cuz of the hostesses in stilettos and pearls; it's all just a little too smug. I use to frequent this particular Jack Astor's long ago and I wasn't impressed then because I saw some busboy with spiked hair and stupid blonde hair tips wearing a t-shirt that said \"Tipping is NOT just a place in China.\" As you can see, the smugness was off the charts back in the day.  I had low expectations for this visit but then we had the greatest server EVER. His name was Justin, and he felt like a dear old friend. He felt like he was the kind of friend you could ugly cry on and just WRECK his white dress shirt with smeared makeup and he'd still be like, \"don't worry, I was gonna throw this shirt out anyway!\" 

I met up with two girlfriends to catch up and we were blown away by the pulled pork poutine; it's a must have. The meat was tender and fine; they must've had this pig on a low-carb, feces-free diet cuz it wasn't very fatty at all!   I ordered chicken nuggets and I was very satisfied because normally at crappy places like wild wing, they act like it's a big deal to give me two sauces but Justin provided me with like, six sauces. Anyway, the food was good, Justin was great and my one friend is married, the other is engaged and I have two cats with an overflowing litter box. 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Place is super clean.Service was very good. Had chicken blt poutine which was very tasty. Wife had some nachos which were light and tasty. Bathroom was spotless hada huge sink and one of those air dryers that actually worked. Had a 3 dollar sundae for dessert. Id go here before moxies or earls. Same kind of food but tastier. It is a family restaurant but if you go early not a problem."}
{"text":"Had amazing service here! Got the nachos with chicken and a side ceaser salad to split with a friend. Server was so helpful in making suggestions! Each of us got the brownie cookie dessert, but there was only one left, so dessert was on the house and they added some ice cream!

The only reason why this wasn't a five is because the food isn't spectacular, but the service is amazing! Definitely good for drinks and apps though, olympics was on which was a huge plus!

Sorry for the lack of pics!"}
{"text":"I just dined here with my two sisters and our server reza was horrible. we did not like the food and after we told him we got the worst customer service ive ever gotten, he took 30 min to get the check and only gave it to us when we got up and asked him. On top of that he shortchanged us $5. I do not recommend their food or service"}
{"text":"Came here with the family for my brothers 19th birthday it was good experience and the staff was friendly. The food was not too good, My pasta with shrimp tasted like it was made a deay ago and put in the microwave, the steak was dry but the drinks were good. Overall it was a pretty good experience, the food could be better tho"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with 8 colleagues on Thursday night. 

In the apps, the lobster and crap dip was delicious and creamy - the best part of my meal. Nachos and calamari were average.

The Oreo shake was disappointing because it didn't have much Oreo - I would have been satisfied perhaps if it was a vanilla shake. 

I ordered a veggie burger with salad - I've had this twice at Jack Astors (I believe the Square One location) and it had been amazing, probably the best veggie burger I've had. I eat beef so I know what a \"real\" burger tastes like, and even so I've really enjoyed JA's veggie burger in the past. This one was just OK... it's been a while since my last visit, but I think the difference was less flavour in the patty and less goat cheese crumble. 

Service was good - they were very accommodating of 4 people who requested to split mains (split the mains at the kitchen into separate plates, rather than just giving empty plates for my coworkers to split it themselves)."}
{"text":"Second time my group has visited this location.  During our first visit, we had a group of about 8.  Initially, our orders were taken and the service was well received.  When the food arrived, one of my friend who ordered a rare steak received a steak that was medium-well cooked.  During a second order of food, our food took over 45 minutes to arrive.  During that time, my poutine came out cold, and one of the server informed my friend that his dessert had been dropped, and that they were making a new one.  After another 25 minutes, we informed our regular server that we were still waiting for a dessert, which he was not aware that it was being re-made.  

My second experience at this location happened today.  We had a group of 5, and our waitress was rarely there to take our orders.  It took over 30 minutes before she arrived to take our orders for food.  When the food came, two of our orders were wrong.  I ordered the saucy chicken fingers and fries, and my order was one of the two which were done incorrectly as it had no sauce.  The food took another 15 minutes to be corrected, and by that time, my food was noticeably cold as if they simply added the sauce to my meal.  The chicken was cold, as well as the fries.  When we got our bills, to our surprise, there was a service charge to our bills.  Definitely would not have tipped this much due to the lack of quality service.  As we left, we asked the front desk what was the minimum guests required before the service charge was mandatory, which he informed us was 8.  So we got charged a service fee without meeting the minimum, and was forced to tip more than what was deserved.  Will not be coming to this location ever again."}
{"text":"I like coming here.. the food isn't necessarily the best but the vibe is good, staff are usually pretty laid back and friendly... my fav thing about this joint is the location. Heart of the downtown core. Premium 416. That outdoor patio in the summer time is off the chain!"}
{"text":"Typical bar food. Nothing worthy of eating without a drink in hand. Friendly staff however at busy times expect not to receive your food for a while. Loud environment and groups are welcomed."}
{"text":"I work downtown and used to visit JA more often. I hurt my foot and have to walk with a cane. My family dropped by the office. My first thought was \"Let's got to Jack Astor's\"
Even though it would be hard walking with my cane. 
Big mistake. They put 6 chairs on 2 tables for 2 people. 3 adults and 3 kids. 
I am disabled. I cannot sit in the crowded aisle. 
This seems too crowded. 
There would not be enough room for people to walk past. 
I am not planning to return. 
We should have the fire marshal look at their seating/table arrangement"}
{"text":"Some might give more stars just for having a busty super hot young blond waitress in a short tight dress.  I am all in favor of having young hot servers of any gender.  I know some of you don't believe me, but really, I don't.  However I don't like slow, unattentive service unless the place is really busy and the server apologizes and does their best.  I was a waitress once and know how it can be.  I am also not a fan of generic overpriced food.  This place reminds me of TGI Fridays or something.  Nothing special.  But I was starving, really starving and just couldn't walk any more and was ready to settle for anything so I did.  I got a veggie burger, beer and fries.  Mainly because they had sh*t for vegetarian options.  I prefer healthy food, usually but will eat crap on occasion.  They had a few salads I could have ordered but I wanted cooked green veggies.  Oh well.  The burger and fries were good.  Lots of beer on tap.  But we had to wait quite a while to order, had to ask twice for water (with 20 minutes in between each order because she didn't come back to our table for that long), and then we had to wait a long time for our check.  Being cute only gets you so far, I hope this girl has a backup career in mind.

Food is not cheap for what you get.  There are way better options around.  But if you like sports bars and generic American style pub food you might like this place."}
{"text":"This place is brutal! Soooooo annoyed with chain restaurants that suck in Pickering 


Came in and sat down in a booth in the open bar  seating and was told I could not sit down at that table yet no one was sitting there....

A waitress walked passed me 3 times and said she would be with us in a minute... and never came back .. it was 5pm and not busy at all..

FYI YOU are not fooling anyone with your \"jacked up beer\" it's actually just a normal size pint... but cost 2$"}
{"text":"First Jack Astors I've been too. Still at one of the top branches I'd recommend. First visit 2008 last visit spring 2015. I've ordered almost everything on this menu, they have yet to fail! 

My only complaint is come early or you will not get a spot. This place is always packed on summer nights and weekends. Patio is really big! Inside is smaller compared to other locations. 

Staffs are polite, food arrives quickly and in fashion. 
They make the drink here really good. 

HINT. Carpool. Parking space is limited, don't park at the theatre across the street you will get a ticket!

Recommended."}
{"text":"Jack Astors never fails me. 

This location is my favourite. More than 60 screens, possibly the biggest location I've have ever been too. 
Try their smokey burger with Cesar salad combo. Sweet potato fries were also pretty good here. They have the best drinks deals at this branch by far, I think its because it near all the hotels around the airport. 

Recommended. Used to come here once a month between 2011-mid2013. Thanks to our servers Amanda and Kelly!!"}
{"text":"I was at Jack Astor's Yonge & Dundas recently and had the displeasure of speaking with the general manager.  He was clearly strung out on cocaine which was very disturbing.  There was white powder on one of his nostrils and he was speaking quickly and erratically gesturing his arms.  I have a lot of experience with signs of drug abuse considering I am an addiction counsellor.  I find it troubling that the general manager of this establishment indulges in illegal drug use while on duty in such a reckless manner.  

Our server kept hounding me to fill out some kind of survey on an iPad, saying it would only take a minute when it took much, much longer.  I don't appreciate being hounded to fill out a survey by the server; they are clearly being incentivized to do so by the management which is not in the best interest of the customers. 

It is safe to say I will never be returning to this location."}
{"text":"We went to this location tonight and honestly it was one of my best experiences ever.Hamed is the manager and he acted so professional and responsive that was over our expectations!!!
Thanks a lot for your great care."}

{"text":"Well i enjoy eating at the bar section because theres loud music and the service is a bit faster and waitresses are friendly. Enjoy their bruschetta very much!! Also their avocado dip is delicious. Avoid the asian nachos not good at all. Burger is a must as well but side order poutine is lacking cheese... Mostly fries and sauce. If its your birthday you get a brownie and i thought they would sing but they didnt!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Jack Astor's before and the food and service is usually pretty decent. My latest experience however was somewhat disappointing. I ordered the sauced up chicken fingers with sweet potato fries and the lobster and crab dip. The chicken fingers and sweet potato fries were not very good. The fries were way too salty and even dipping it in sauce didn't help because it was so salty. The chicken fingers were tender but I did not like the taste of the sauce. The saving grace of the meal was the lobster and crab dip which is always great.

The server did a good job considering we were in a large group and the orders came fairly quickly.

Overall my experience with Jack's has always been ok. Not too bad if you plan to just grab a small bite and a few drinks."}
{"text":"The prices are high compare to food quality. I ordered fajitas and it was some strips of beef with lots of onions. No peppers or any veggies. 

The salads were 19 dollar and so mediocre. Any way, I won't recommend this place for a second chance."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. The sour cream looked like cottage cheese. The waitress was very kind and personable. One issue was the volume of the music in the bar side. But they gave our dads beer glasses for fathers day. Pretty cool."}
{"text":"Not the best experience I've had. The place is understaffed. While service was very polite and nice, it took an excessive amount of time for my burger to come out. There was a flying floating around, and the place just felt like it needed some renovations. The food itself came out undercooked and lukewarm, and I came when there were not even that many people. I would recommend Milestones instead which is right across the street."}
{"text":"love the blooper reel that plays on loop on half the tvs!

also, the garlic bread is TO DIE FOR. 

drinks are good but expensive, lots of specialty stuff. they're not strong but they're delicious.

food is pretty good, kind of on the expensive end of pub food."}
{"text":"We Came here in a beautiful Saturday afternoon as a group of 5 and our group was greatly turned off.
1. I was the first to arrive and so was seated first by our waitress, only to realize later that I was to be left alone for the next 20 minutes. 
2. After my friends came, we all had to wait again for long to get served and then get our drinks. 
3. Fries came cold. We requested a change and what came next was no better. Just re-dipping in oil will make it warmer than what we had, really.

Edited: fries were taken off the bill."}
{"text":"Visited today for a lunch break while at the FanExpo today. My mother ordered a burger and I ordered a chicken sandwich (I believe it was called The Roadkill) and we were very impressed. They serve a lot of fries as a side though, so you might not be able to eat them all (which is okay by me). The service was fast.

The only complaint I have is about the obnoxiously loud the music that was playing. I had to raise my voice to talk to my mother across the table, and I had a hard time hearing her. For 11:05 AM (when we walked in), I found this way too loud. I felt like I was at a rave, not a restaurant.

All-in-all it was a good meal, however."}
{"text":"Mehhhh 2.5 stars.
Good location, nice, clean interior, and that's about it.
I ordered a strawberry daiquiri because I usually love how sweet, fruity, and delicious they make them at Jack Astor's.
The one they handed me was melted, the sugar tasted like it had been sitting on the rim for days, and it didn't taste the greatest! I also couldn't squeeze my lime into it because it was a thin slice, not a wedge (I know I'm being picky but I like a little bit of sour in my daiquiris!).
Our server seemed a little curt but warmed up by the end (or maybe we just didn't care after we had a few drinks in us).
We tried the new fries with chimichuri, tomatoes, and cheese (what cheese?). They were nasty. Even my beloved ketchup couldn't save them.
Don't order them.
We had shots, the boys tried an amaretto, beer, coca cola, and some other liquor one called Srgt Pepper or something similar (I was too scared to try it).
I chose the 'Florida Jumpsuit' which I wouldn't get again. It was Sour Puss, orange vodka and cranberry juice I think.
I liked the location and it's good for drinks so I wouldn't be opposed to going again."}
{"text":"Love this Jack Astor's. I've been coming here for years.
Good drinks and delicious food. 
I like coming for lunch for the parmesan chicken bowties or after work for a pitcher or girly drinks.
Their desserts are delicious too.
Not the biggest fan of their burgers though, a little bland.

My go-to when getting drinks and a bite to eat with friends.
It's a great atmosphere for get togethers. Casual or a little dressy, either one suits this place.
$$ - $$$ depending on how many drinks heehee."}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Food was okay.  Place was extremely busy because of the Christmas season.  But food came out quickly.  Menu seems fine for lunch but probably wouldn't come here for dinner."}
{"text":"I rarely come to Jackastors especially at this location because over all it is over priced for the quality of food and service they offer, but last night I was in the area and couple of friends wanted to stop by for some dinner/drinks. It was a slow Sunday night and we had to wait 25 mins or more for our food. When it arrived the nachos were burnt and my burger was also and extremely dry. Very disappointed and will not be returning to this location ever. The one I usually stop by for food and drinks after work on front street has slightly better properly cooked food and service. There are plenty of other great and affordable restaurants near by."}
{"text":"My family and I waited 30 minutes and no one came to take our order.  We asked several times if someone could find our waiter/waitress.  We just ended up getting up and leaving!

And on top of it, the tables were squeezed so close together.  My chair was in the walkway and people kept walking by and bumping into me.

Safe to say I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Bonne bouffe, pas trop cher. Belle ambiance et style mais tout de même accueillant pour les enfants (et accommodant pour les gens allergiques). Grands écrans pour les amateurs de sport. Un bon compromis pour tous les genres!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure which Jack Astor's Bar and Grill location I went to.  The one I went to had a nice view of Toronto skyline.  They had an outdoor patio which was nice.  I ordered their poutine which is fries with cheese curd and gravy.  I hear it is popular in Canada and it is on the McDonald menu too from what I hear.  I also had a peach margarita.

Service was good."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Jack Astor's on our first afternoon in Toronto & was not disappointed. Service was great & quick and the food wasn't bad as well. The burger that I ordered was great but wished I could have said the same about our Poutine. We were surprised that the Poutine found in our local NYC restaurants were better then at Jack Astors since they are a chain restaurant & also a staple of Toronto. Nevertheless, I will definitely be back on our next trip up to Toronto!"}
{"text":"Basically this restaurant is the worst restaurant of my life. They objectivity women to the extent that they don't even treat them like human beings. It is sad to say but they will make their female servers walk around in very specific high heels and lululemon skirts just to make a show. This kind of behaviour is essentially unacceptable in 2017 and yet here we are... Basically if you value your daughter's, sister's, or mother's dignity, and their self-worth is something you care about, there are about 10 other restaurants within this vicinity that would be better worth your money. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The management and staff at this new Jack Astor's are really going the extra mile to make a good first impression.

I've visited this location four times since it opened.  I've had some of the best service that I've seen at a chain restaurant.  The wait staff are friendly and attentive.  The location is big with plenty of seating.  There's a nice patio that beats the other options in the area.  They also have lots of TVs everywhere for watching whatever game is on.

On one visit, we went here for lunch.  The two of us were seated at 12:32 - they wrote the time on the table - and they made a passing reference to their in and out in 40 minutes lunch thing.  At 12:58 we were happily chatting away when someone who appeared to be the kitchen manager came out and apologized for the \"excessive wait\", said \"we can do better than that time\" and told us that our meal was free.  We were blown away.  On another visit, they were so attentive that one of my colleagues described it as \"the best service of all time\".

They seem to have lots of extra staff there right now so I can't be certain that they'll be able to maintain the level of service, but they're off to a great start.  

One area for improvement - on our very first lunch visit some guy came around with the pepper shaker and asked if we want \"papa\" on our food.  None of us could really understand his accent.  He then proceeded to put enormous amount of pepper on my meal, even after I told him to stop.  

Otherwise, great start, Jack Astor's!  You have my business."}
{"text":"Do not underestimate the salad.... There's a Cobb salad on the menu that is sooo good and filling you don't need anything else with it other then a light ale to pair with it. Always been a fan of this location, good service, and its fun :)"}
{"text":"I am very lucky to call this place MY local bar! Always being served great food. Super chill, kind, fun and caring bartenders. The nachos, the wings, the burgers, pastas aaaaaallllll are great choices. My go to place after a long day at work. Well done JA yonge-bloor team!"}
{"text":"Food has consistently been awful and bar tenders would rather flirt than serve. Will not be returning ever"}
{"text":"We had a group of 11 for a Bachelorette party and came here for lunch before exploring downtown. It was the best decision we could have made! They had us seated quickly, and out on a beautiful patio. The food and drinks we ordered were all great, and the service was even better. Our server (Andrew, ask for him he was the best) gave us an entire list of things to do during the day and evening since we were from out of town. He helped make our trip even more fun with the best local places to see and things to do. I would hands down come back here again (and everyone in our group would agree) for a great lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Smaller portions and higher prices--the beginning of the end for so many good restaurants. 

The new menu is only one page, single sided. That's the first case of shrinkage for Jack. I ordered the new Asian Tuna Bowl for $17.  Several pieces of seared tuna, a quarter of an avocado and a couple of veggies on a bed of rice. A bit rich for so little. 

My dinner guest had the usual chicken and bow tie pasta--again, a smaller portion than usual. 

Disappointing after decades of eating at Jack Astors. At least the Caramel Dream desert was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Still the best one in the West end. Had the steak and shrimp, but still prefer the nachos and wings. Try to get Adrian, best server thus far."}
{"text":"Wait staff was excellent and very frindly. It is your typical chain bar/restaurant with good quality food and portions. I had the chicken club and a salad and was very more pleased with it. The very friendly waitress stop to check and make sure my meal was OK and ask if I needed anything and had a chat as I was dining alone. Made me feel welcomed and comfortable. 

Good walk from the Weston Bristol Place and stretch your legs and get out of the hotel. I will definitely return on my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"This Jack Astor's just recently opened and based on our visit, it appears they're still going through some growing pains. They were out of filters to make coffee so they had to run across the street to Starbucks and their deep fryer wasn't working so french fries were out of the questions... not such a bad thing.

We ordered from the following items from the lunch menu:

Chicken Club Sandwich with a side salad and Blackberry Balsamic Dressing

When I looked at this item on the menu it almost appeared to be a slider but turned out to be more food than I expected. It's served on a toasted focaccia which really added flavour to this club and gave it a nice texture. Definitely not your average club sandwich! The salad was fresh and crisp but the kicker here was the dressing... it was fantastic! I would absolutely order this dish again.

The Smiling Buddha

This dish was definitely the most bang for your buck! The salad was huge and with the various combination of ingredients it made for a well rounded lunch. Although our clubs were delicious, I think this dish was the envy of the table.

Chicken Quesadilla and Salad

I wish I had a picture to show you just how unimpressive this dish was. When it was placed on the table I honestly thought, 'what's the point?'. This could not have been made on anything larger than a 6\" quesadilla. It contained very little chicken and took only four bites to finish. I've seen appetizers bigger than this. Seriously not worth the money!!

For the most part, the food and service was good, considering the shortfalls they had to deal with. They just opened so I'm not going to hold it against them. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I came here the other day with a group of girls from work. The service was very friendly and respectful of our time constraints. Being just the next block down from the North York subway stop, it makes it quick and convenient to get to.

I ordered the California Grilled Chicken Salad as I had had this once before at another location and honestly, it's about the only thing I like on their menu. It is a very good salad and I would definitely recommend it. I did feel however, that my chicken might have been a little undercooked... although I suffered no 'issues'.

Again though, it's the only thing I like on their menu so I think I would be more apt to go to Milestones which is right at the North York subway station than to walk down to Jack Astor's.

Their saving grace is definitely their service."}
{"text":"I'll keep this simple: the food is over priced, but tasted good. The best part was the martini. The worst part was the dirty plates for our appetizers, so I had to request for new plates.

I didn't really enjoy the atmosphere and could careless about Jack Astor's design concept. The lack of professionalism by the waiters was appalling- particularly cross talk; although, our waiter was good, and actually attractive.

 I ordered a chicken bacon burger, with a martini. The burger came with a fries on the side, the fries were in a metallic cup. I thought, it was  joke to present it that way. It sort of like giving measured amounts of food in an effort to save money. 

The question is: would I go back? 
Answer: not unless someone else was paying for it, because it wasn't worth it for me. i could make a better meal myself."}
{"text":"You know, I've been going to Jack Astor's (this location specifically) since high school and it doesn't seem as though the place has changed that much. When it comes down to it, that's actually not a bad thing at all. The food is still pretty good for a big chain, the fun atmosphere is basically the same as it was then and the waitresses are still pretty cute even if I'm now older than most of them.

I went most recently with the family and the fiancée (don't tell her what I said about the waitresses) and had a perfectly fine time. The booths seem a little bit more cramped but that probably because everyone is a little bigger (except for me, I weigh the same as I did in high school). The menu has changed some I'm sure but so long as the delicious, irresistible and impossibly greasy cheesy garlic pan bread is still there, I'm happy. The Elvis booth is still in the corner and the décor is still garish as ever. You get the point.
 
I had the aforementioned cheesy bread (and actually shared some with the table), plus the Sweet & Spicy Tofu Fajitas...I first discovered them about a year or so ago and it was actually the first restaurant that I recall adding a proper protein to the vegetarian fajitas rather than just hold the meat. It's a nice (and important) touch and the fact that they're seasoned quite nicely is always a plus. Choice of Smokey BBQ, Teriyaki or (my choice) Spicy Jalapeno is also a nice touch. Everyone else had some sort of chicken sandwich or beef dip and there were no complaints. Special mention to the good fries and nice selection of beers on draught...not an extensive wine list or any fancy cask ales but this isn't the kind of place you go to for that.
 
So yeah, it's a chain but it's a pretty good one and I'm never disappointed. I like the food just fine and I prefer it over the fancier and more expensive places like Milestone's, Earl's or Moxie's.   Maybe it's just the fond memories of coming here during lunch, promising to make it back before the next period and usually missing that goal by a long shot. Or maybe it's still pretty good."}
{"text":"If you are in it for a good bar food (nachos are the best) and loud noise, you are in a perfect place."}
{"text":"I really like jack Astors because it's a spprts bar restaurant but they have beautiful salads. Specifically Smiling Buddha is very good.
In This specific branch they are very friendly. My husband broke a glass of beer and ruined the Putin in front of him, but they changed the putin and beer without any charges and without giving any attitude. 
Like it here alot."}
{"text":"Came here on Labor Day, and it was super crowded for a holiday, plus it's right by the airport. 

This is a \"Fridays\" type establishment where they serve wings, burgers, pasta, salads, etc. The things I like here the most are the Wings and the Cheesy Pan bread. They are pretty consistent across the chain just like any other chain restaurant. 

What made this location stand out to me was their service. Everyone worked as a team to make sure my party was served. 

I ordered the bow tie chicken pasta with extra sauce and it was brought out as I liked. Also we ordered wings and pan bread. Consistent flavor again. 

This is my location of choice anytime I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"The service here was so amazing! I was here with a friend and Jay, one of the managers, greeted us as soon as we sat down. He told us that the restaurant is a little busy so he apologized. I told him we needed to catch a movie and from that point on, he personally brought us everything. We had a drink, ate a salad, and had our entrees all within 40 mins. Jay went above and beyond for us and we appreciated it so much!"}
{"text":"Ok ...Fact: T.O is overpriced ...But at least give use what we pay for! 2/22/15 went there before the Nickelback concert at the ACC and decided i wanted a cheeseburger.
I ask you, how can you charge $14.69 for a frozen hamburger from Costco. I took a double take when my plate came, i had the look of astonishment wonder if 3/4 of my fries fell of the plate in transit? NO, No this is normal ...I counted them 9 fries! I felt ripped of knowing that this over-priced undervalued establishment should have given me 10 fries. The waitress who i didn't see enough to remember her name was just flashing her eye candy(BOOBS!) around trying get more tips from any guy that would fall for it. i must say though she had a fit body..it was a shame about her face( Fugly!)
Anyway, concert was good. and the food...the corner sausage cart is a better option for food and the service is better as well."}
{"text":"My family and I LOVED Jack Astor's during our years in Montreal. The restaurant exudes a casual, energetic and offbeat vibe, where the waiters are funny, you can draw on the tables, and anything goes. They have a huge menu but their garlic pan bread is what I remember. So yummy. Great place for kids."}
{"text":"This location is garbage. Always make mistakes. And has made my stomach upset more than once."}
{"text":"The food was average the service was good. Pan bread was delicious as usual. Chicken fingers were good coleslaw was okay. Pad Thai was not the traditional tasted too sweet."}
{"text":"This place is okay.  I was slightly dismayed that they didn't have any drink special.  No worries though, I was only hoping to get a few in before I went to my real standby bar.  Overall, this place is sufficient for my needs; decent beer, nice and friendly bartenders."}
{"text":"Service was good, food came out at a reasonable time. 
Jack Astor's is known for amazing pan garlic bread, and chicken strips and fries and they didn't disappoint. However what did disappoint, was this chicken grilled cheese. It said it had chicken lime and tortilla chips inside the grilled cheese sandwich, but when the sandwich arrived it wasn't as described. It was dry, had hot peppers and they had you dip the sandwich in  something like tomato sauce. The flavours didn't go well at all."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for drinks and appys with some colleagues. Nice atmosphere, great service, yummy drinks and food, all good stuff. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Usually Jack Astors is great! But I ordered the pasta I usually order and it was sooooooooo dry!!!! When I asked for more sauce they brought it to me COLD! Terrible experience. The manager didn't charge me for my meal, but I really wish I could have enjoyed the pasta, because the flavour was awesome it was just super dry."}
{"text":"I went to jack astor's rathburn rd west located near the chapters books store. Across the street from sq1 shopping mall, very expensive, extremely dissapointed in the food portions. Way to small insufficient serving, incomplete meal more like a appetizer than a meal. Not satisfied, the restaurant has been newly renovated looks great. Service not so  great, staff unable to multi task. On a mon afternoon not so busy,  I asked the server for a cold glass of water been waiting for more then 10 mins till i received the water. Def the 1st & the last time i ever go to jack astor's restaurant. Def not recommend."}
{"text":"Its a decent place to dine in (referring to all the branches) but am not sure the quality is up to par anymore. They need to change the menu...its not even worth paying 10-20$ on some of them. But what I do recommend is the appetizer menu..Its quite nice.. and their cocktail drinks are good too (cant go wrong!) but the rest is blah."}
{"text":"Super bad service, the hostess obviously was nice, but the 2 barbie doll servers we had were really rude and rushing, I know they are busy but seriously. Food and drinks took forever, the food was nice, but service was awful. Never coming back to this place."}
{"text":"no matter in what part of the city you're in, if all else fails, Jack AStorS is your last resort.  Situated along other restaurants at Shops on Don Mills, this place is definitely HAPPENING! especially on a Friday night. 
Both my friend and I originally tried getting a seat at the bar, but failed, so the next best thing was a small booth which worked out to be perfect!
After she ordered the....cocktail (forgot which one) I opted for their Argentine Malbe (Yes i love red) and we placed our order for their shareable nachos.
Our server T*** (due to identity) was awesome! he provided us some recommendation when it came to either adding beef or chicken, thankfully we chose chicken.
Portions were huge, so huge we both couldn't finish it, as we both had dinner earlier.
Prices are decent, vibe is kickin and service was kick assssss."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night with the soccer team thinking it wouldn't be busy, I was totally wrong!! This place was just jammed packed! We were able to get a patio table for a party of 8.  

Here's the breakdown:

-Jack's Nachos: 4.5/5 
Their portions are satisfying and great to share amongst the party.  If you want to keep your nachos all tasty and appealing, do not order it with beef and chili.

-Chicken Fajitas scored a 2.5/5 due to lack of chicken, and portion.

-Bruschetta: which scored 3/5, though presentable, it was lacking the flavor.  It was a bit too sour with the excess balsamic vinegar that was on the bread.

Overall the atmosphere is awesome, it almost felt like a club with the loud music, and bartending competition that was going on inside.  Nonethless with a spacious patio, be sure to make reservations as we were waiting for 20mins.

TIP: If its going to be a lovely day, make sure you call to reserve patio seats as this place fills up very quickly due to location, and proximity to the mall."}
{"text":"came here to conclude our bar hopping night, however as usual the place seemed to be dirty as we came towards closing time.  I've been to this location a few times, however this is the only time that I've been where the service was worse than last time. We decided to have a drink and some finger foods to end our night out.
Aside from water, we decided to try their Jager bomb shot special (4 for $27) which comes with a shot dropping device that drops right into your glass full of Red Bull.  Truly a fun experience.
As for food, we decided to share a basket of fries since we were more thirsty THAN hungry.
Overall the service was mediocre and the over place was messy."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday night around 6:30pm. The outside patio area was completely full, so we were told to check inside. Luckily, there were tables for our party of 8, and we were seated within 15 minutes!

Our server was extremely helpful and dropped by a couple of times during the meal to check up on us as well. 4 of us split appetizers/starters and our bills were handled very well. I split a guacamole chip dip. For about $7 it was a decently portioned size, with enough guac for the chips. For my main, I had chicken fingers with fries. It was about $14 and the portions tended to be large though.

The actual quality of the food wasn't stellar though, everything was more or less as expected."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times over the years.
Their menus change over time and overall its a nice place to catch up with friend over drinks and OKAY food.
Their service is dependable on who you get. However in the past I've had mixed feelings. 

If coming on weekends just be aware that parking can be difficult since this venue is among other restaurants that share the same lot. 

They've got featured daily specials and their prices are reasonable. 

Coming here with some friends, I decided to give their chicken fingers with fries a try (I know, unlike me) after seeing the table next to us ordering them.  Got to say! they were good and huge too! 

As for drinks I kept it classy with a 9oz of cab-sav! 

Overall Jacks is a fun environment to catch up with friends, however if you're looking for a gastro-pub food I'd say look somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love jack astor's to begin with. And each location has its own character. This place has the coolest rooftop everrrrrrrr. Specially in summer nites.  The only thing this place lacks its their service. We've been there a few times and the service was terrible. We got ignored and when I brought it up, the manager didn't seem to care. Lol good job 
But despite the service, you will enjoy the roof top and the food OHHHHH BEFORE I FORGET. Order their fish bowl drinks. They are super delicious."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour when we got into Toronto. The place was PACKED!!! They had some good local brews on tap. The servers were very friendly and accommodating. 

We each had a couple beers and some guac. I mean, nothing to write home about. I can't say about the other food, but I get the impression it's just glorified bar food. After two drinks and being pushed and moved around by people we were ready to go!"}
{"text":"I enjoy eating at Jack Astor's, they have a variety of items on their menu that are very appealing  and is a family friendly restaurant where I don't have to be overly worried about my children being loud as it is always loud at Jack Astor's.  The service is good for the most part, depending on the night you go, some nights it is exceptional and others just ho hum, we still always return."}
{"text":"Really bad service. Food was okay. 

We came in late on a Friday night. We were not greeted at the door. In fact, the host (is it hoster if it's a male) was on his cell phone when we came in. We had to wait for him to finish his conversation before he left to go get someone else to seat us. A waitress came and told us that the restaurant section was closed but that we could sit at the bar and order. It was late and we had been up all day so we asked if we could just order carry-out from the bar. We had to scream to get that across because the music was so loud. 

Eventually we were escorted over to the bar. We had to ask for a menu. Finally we ordered (nachos with chili and guac and a chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries).  This meal took approximately 30 minutes to make. My nachos were wrong-no chili, small container of guacamole for $2.99 extra. The manager (?) did go get me a side of chili and extra guac. That was nice. But that was about it. The nachos were not good. My friend did like her chicken sandwich.

There are too many other places to go to and spend your money at than one that does not appreciate your business. I would never go back here again."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time and wonderful dinner. I would most certainly recommend the fresh chicken fingers. Simply put. Amazing! Fresh not frozen is the way to good. The beer was right on as it went along well with the chicken wings. The blue cheese, celery & carrots weren't amazing, but the chicken wings a definite go. Also, go for the nachos, but just the nachos, I found that the added chili doesn't do it justice and just makes it sloppy. And for an entree, the fish and chips dish. Perfect for any occasion. It was late night on the weekend when I went, so it was busy and seating is difficult. If you're looking for outside balcony seating, where smoking is allowed, you may end up waiting for a while. It can get busy. Aside from that the wait staff was excellent, kind and considerate."}
{"text":"Had a Brickworks cider and my friend a Moosehead after dinner next door. Nice place to hangout at the bar area with the TVs... A bit chilly though as it is close to the entrance/exit.  

Too bad they don't have the specials for drinks anymore."}
{"text":"This location is huge and its usually pretty busy. Try to make reservations if you can. Sitting at the bar is always nice too. The service is usually pretty good. You usually get better service at the bar area if you are drinking. As far as the menu goes, I usually order only  one thing. Buffalo Chicken fingers. Which are chicken fingers, made with real fresh chicken and then they are covered in a wing sauce. So good."}
{"text":"Very good chain food, specialty dishes each season, this month sweeter entrees than usual. 

Safe bets are the bread dishes, garlic or cheese garlic, burgers are good, \"chinese\" dishes pretty good, pastas ok. 

Servers all young and eager. Watch for the auto 18 % on groups."}
{"text":"Jack's never fails I had the chicken Parm with pasta The chicken was kind of small the pasta was tasty Another entrée a beer and an aap almost 100 bucks"}
{"text":"Bad food (boring, or too sweet) and bad service. My friend spilled her drink and the server didn't even bother to help us clean up. There was broken glass all over the floor and we had it under our feet until we left. Patio is closed for winter so no reason to come here otherwise. Save your money and go to Joey Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to come here the staff is super friendly and the drinks go down easy. The food however is average, I would reccomend this place for drinks/appetizers or dessert but not a full meal. I went at happy hour which didnt make much of a difference in price but the waitress did come back for last call on happy hour which not alot of places do. I had the chicken tenders which were nothing special considering the price, i also tried the mini donuts for dessert, now that was amazing.  It comes with 3 sides to dip and was also a decent size portion to share. The ambience is fun if you sit on the bar side or on the terrace. The menu is also constantly changing adding a bit of variety for each time adding a new experience to what people may consider\"that same old place\". Ill be back for the donuts and to maybe try a fancy new cocktail."}
{"text":"Portion généreuse , super exclusivité , bonne ambiance un peu comme la cage , le seul point négatif est de faire la poule lors de sa fête"}
{"text":"Server was absent-minded, took a long time to bring two glasses of water to our table and take our order. We ordered the chicken fingers and French fries and a side garden salad.  Food came out fast, salad was nothing great, but the chicken fingers were good. Once we got the bill, the receipt said the tiny salad was $6, whereas the menu said this version (\"sidecar\" portion) was under $3. The waiter said \"they can no longer give add-ons due to renovations\" (????) and would not change the price, despite the fact that the menu said side portions of salads were under $3. We were in a rush and did not have time to push the issue but we will not be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here before they did the renovation and after they did it. The attitude here just completely changed after they did the renovation and the waiters think they are hot stuff and that you should be honored to be eating in there. Well. I went here with a couple of friends for lunch and requested a table where we could watch some tv. So of course they throw us somewhere where the view is terrible and I make them move us to another table. Oh. The place is not packed at all. It's about 1/4 full. 

Well. We start looking over the menu and the smoke alarm starts beeping. Except that there is no smoke. So they just leave it and let it keep beeping. The noise got so annoying that I asked our waiter if he could do something about it. He looks at me and says \"What? You don't like our music?\" while continuing to stare me down after his smart ass remark. So of course I say, \"Ya. Very funny. Seriously. Unplug it like any normal person would do because there's obviously no f@#(*!g smoke.\" Yes. I am pissed. He gives me a look and walks away. The noise continues to beep and other customers are starting to complain. At this point, we've had enough and just leave."}
{"text":"Remember back in the day when Jack's was a place of pure funny?  Funny staff singing and dancing on chairs when it was your birthday?  Loud and obnoxious?  Well Jack's is still loud and obnoxious but now it's because of the customers!

Over the past few years Jack's has slightly upped it's game.  The food is definitely better than what it used to be - there's a more international flair to the dishes.  I had the Bombay Chicken Curry.  Honestly for a chain restaurant it wasn't too bad.  Flavours were there, the rice was nice and fluffly and it even came with naan bread.

Even their drinks have stepped up - you can get an assortment of water - Perrier, Evian or Badoit.  C'est tres chic

I can only imagine how busy and loud it gets on a weekend or Friday night.  As it is, being in the Shops of Don Mills complex it usually is pretty full.  Probably all the people who had to wait too long to get into Joey's. 

Before if you told me that dinner was a Jack's I would groan, now I don't mind as much.  Service was good and plenty of parking in the front as well as the 4 tier parking garage at the back of the complex."}
{"text":"I rarely go to Jack Astor's, probably about a few times a year. When I go, I always enjoy the food and I try to order different things every single time but the ONE ITEM I especially love is the Bruschetta they have that's under the appetizers section. Hands down the best bruschetta I've ever eaten. I always order it.

This place is usually crowded, sometimes I have to wait 20-30 minutes for a table. 

I really enjoy the vibe of the restaurant. It's very loud but everyone who works there is so upbeat and happy that I do not mind it at all. They also make birthdays especially loud with their birthday song but I like it. If you don't like loud environments, this is probably not the place for you.

Overall, I enjoy coming to Jack Astor's because the food and the service is always great!"}
{"text":"lol, They didn't put any avocado in my \"Tuna Mango Avocado Salad\"

Honestly, this place is super hit or miss. If you come at off-peak hours, it'll probably be okay but as soon as it gets busy the service decreases drastically. Not a fan of Jack Astors anymore after three mediocre experiences; will not be coming back."}
{"text":"After an extensive walk through Yorkville taking some pictures of the lovely holiday decorations, we ended up walking around this area and decided to get dinner here.  We figured there would be something to please everyone at a decent price. The closer to the holidays, the cheaper I get.  We got lucky and were seated in the bar area so no wait!  Until the table they gave us was pushed up against the wall (right where the fire hose thing-y was).  Certainly hope no fires break out because no way can you access that thing (which I think may be illegal, but who am I to say..lol).  After we squeezed in (I am a petite person and I had trouble getting into the area/seat.  I almost was going to go under the table, but with a lot of stomach sucking in I managed to just barely fit in).

My order of butter chicken (why do I get Indian food from non Indian restaurants??) came with some pieces of chicken with half decent sauce and some little burnt up bits on the rice that was not fresh.  I later realized those burnt bits were cauliflower.  I also got about 2 pieces of small naan with it...but hard.  It actually cracked when I tried to break off a piece to sop up the sauce.  Not the fresh, pillowy naan breads that I am familiar with. 

The only redeeming part was that the drinks were decent (don't bother super sizing it because it is an extra $3 for that privilege and that my friend got the steak with the lobster/mash potato mash up.  I tried a piece of the steak and it was pretty good!  Damn, so ordered the wrong dish.  

The menu is pretty extensive so lots of choices, the service is ok..although since we were sitting in the front we could see about 4 servers just congregating at that front.  If 2 of them were on the floor getting orders out or getting bills to the table service would have been faster.

There is an outdoor area but since it was where are my gloves freaking ass cold, obviously it was not open.

At least they don't give you crayons and that brown craft paper on the table anymore!"}
{"text":"Jack Astor's is a good group place to go to. If you're planning on watching a game or just looking to get a big group of people together, they have good food, good service and a price that's reasonable. I've been here many many times and have never been dissapointed. Jack Astor's has been made to be the go to place for groups. 

Food (I'll update this as I remember the rest of the dishes I've had here haha): 
-They have a dip which I forget - not their lobster crab, but it's a spinach dip I think - is absolutely amazing!!)
-Wings are \"meh\", look for the other dishes"}
{"text":"Well .....I've been here before and don't know what happend to this location . 
We arrived around 430pm on a Sunday ..
Service was terrible ....waited 15 minutes for our waiter to come to us to take our order . Then another 10 for our drinks to arrive only to have 2 of 3 drinks to come another 15 for the 3rd drink to come .....
Then our nachos were burnt . So needles to say we didn't stay to order our dinner as our waitress never came back to check on us and didn't feel like waiting around much longer . She didn't seem to care or a manager come by to check as he seen us waiting around for a long time aswell . Very dissapointed .
Aswell I have to mention they were not busy at all either ! I guess I won't be back ."}
{"text":"We came here to hang out before catching a movie.  They have a patio on John St, so needless to say, it's pretty loud.

The drinks were sugary sweet (had some mango berry bellini thing).

The nachos were way way way way huge...
Also ordered guacamole, a quesadilla, and something else...

The quality of food was only ok, I don't think it will be high on my list of places to visit again.  Other than it's location, there weren't too many other positives."}
{"text":"Met up with a few couples here the other evening

Pros:  great patio, ok servers, they serve alcohol.
Cons:  It's a Jack Astor's - the food is ok ~ reasonable bar fare.  We had some lobster/crab dip and some spring rolls, there was also some sandwiches ordered.

location, location, location...enough said."}
{"text":"This is the friendliest Jack's I have ever been in. The server at the bar is super funny and makes perfect drinks. Matt was great at recommending us our drinks and helping us decide what to eat. The appetizer came really fast with our drinks. We ordered the lobster and crab dip and it was warm and fresh. The Asiago chicken bow ties pasta is delicious and perfect. Good and fast service."}
{"text":"drinks are great but Jack Astors is just your standard restaurant bar."}
{"text":"We were passing through for a Ragnar Niagra race and stopped in to refuel!! (All the way from Corning, NY). The place was awesome! The manager personally came over to welcome us and thank us for coming in. He offered to send us on our way with Starbucks coffee and gave us a discount off our bill. Great variety on the menu. We had a vegetarian in our group and she felt like she had tons of options."}
{"text":"Situated within the trendy Centropolis, Jack Astor's is ready to stake its claim in Laval. 

Did it?

Sadly not.


DECOR : 

You can't help but notice how huge this place is when you walk in. This restaurant has two floors to discreetly seat and forget about their clients. There are large comfortable booths available in the middle that will make you more visible to them. The bar is huge as well and the staff very vibrant. The decor is warm and modern with lots of space around you so that you never feel crowded. 

An interesting concept this chain of restaurant has is that they allow you to write on their table with crayons made available at each table. I tried to write \"SOS, hungry!\" but it didn't help me get my food any quicker. Every table is covered with a disposable carton paper cover that serve as a temporary drawing board instead of the traditional cloth covers most restaurants have. This concept was quite useful for us during our visit to pass the time.


FOOD :

After some contemplating I ordered the Holy Smokes BBQ Burger while my wife ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Focaccia. My burger ended up being quite fantastic and well selected by my part with the meat being incredibly moist and savory and the crispy fried onions did their magic to my palette. Every bite got better and tears formed in my eyes as the burger quickly evaporated from my greasy fingers. 

I don't know what else is on the menu but I'd go back simply to eat this burger over and over again.

My wife's selection however was mightily disappointing and she left half of it untouched on her plate while she watched her husband destroy a defenseless burger barely a foot away from her. She offered me a bite of her sandwich to make me understand why she didn't enjoy her meal and I had to agree, it was pretty disgusting. I had to immediately wash down that horrible taste with another bite of my Holy Smokes BBQ Burger.

She contented herself with her fries.

My side order consisted of onion rings and I generously offered them to my starving wife, as they were done... \"just right\" with a hint of crispy while still retaining the moistness inside the onion.

She was appreciative.

Lastly on the subject of food.... kudos to the store providing an excellent dining experience by still allowing their patrons to order sodas not normally offered elsewhere. Vanilla coke? 

Yes, please!


SERVICE :

This is where things complicated. The service was very disappointing. This is putting it mildly.

Initially, we were served quickly. We were seated down, asked for what drinks we wanted, she wrote it down and then she took off. 

We did not see her again for 15 minutes. 

We initially spent the time chatting about things, then playing with our iPhones as we waited.. and when she came back, she did so without our drinks. She corrected this by bringing our drinks within 2 minutes in a fluster. We then ordered our food.

... and then we waited one hour for our food.

This is unacceptable. This type or service, no matter how busy you are, should never be allowed if you don't want to earn the reputation they have been earning in previous reviews. This service sucked. An hour for a burger? Seriously?

We spend the majority of our time drawing on the table to eventually playing tic-tac-toe and hangman and making fun of the service with other tables who were in the same situation.

No excuses were made by the staff, no arrangements. The ignored us completely. Just terrible service all together.

When the food was served, I quickly asked for the bill as I didn't intend to wait 30 minutes for the bill when I finished eating. 

I only had to wait 20 minutes.

Seriously?

I should be thankful my plates were warm.


PRICE : 

It's hard to justify 15$+ for a burger but the burger was well worth it. Expect to pay 60$ for two people. It's not cheap, nor is it expensive. It depends how much you're willing to pay. The value is about right for a fancy restaurant of this kind.


BOTTOM LINE :

I give Jack Astor's 2 stars. The only reason was because the burger was so excellent that I cannot in good conscience give this restaurant 1 star after eating such a delight. 

If the service were great, or even average, I would have given this restaurant 4 stars even despite my wife's poor meal.

The service was abysmal. Terrible. Unacceptably bad.

But the burger was so good that it could have ended wars, I'm sure of it.

Try this place, preferably when the staff can do their job adequately."}
{"text":"Had a very bad experience here. Waited 35 min and asked to wait 20-30 more as they gave away our table twice! If you are francophone or LGBTQ I'd spend my money elsewhere as this was mostly the reason we got ignored."}
{"text":"We decided to stop into Jack Astors before our Tuesday night movie.
The waitress brought us to a booth across from the bar. As I was going to sit down, I noticed to be what looked like a huge wad of gum on the drinks menu. As i tried to grab it to request for a clean one, this \"wad of gum\" decides to crawl down the page and on the table at me.
*COCKROACH ALERT*

I shrieked, left the restaurant and called DINE SAFE.
Enough said. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I've always liked Jack Astors.  Im a fan of their menu.... when it doesn't change!!  Stop trying so hard to change menu.  You finally find something you like only to find out months later they changed their menu AGAIN!  I know it has nothing to do with this location and that's why I still give this 4 stars.  Actually I give it 4 because of the servers.  Why are the women here all models and the ones in the 905 area resemble walruses?  I guess your competing with your neighbor at Joey.  Good job.  It works!"}
{"text":"I'm giving JA's 4 stars solely based on their bruschetta. I can't even explain what an orgasmic explosion it creates in my mouth.... It's got tomatoes, basil, feta, balsamic glaze and some kind of thick feta-like sauce. OMMGGGGG.....

I had the burger too, it was your basic bar burger.

IF YOU ARE A HUMAN AND LIKE GOOD THINGS - BRUSCHETTA!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of this Jack's. It's actually my favorite so far. Food is the same it always is -  my favorite is bruschetta. They honestly have the most amazing bruschetta I have ever had in my life...It's so packed with basil, tomatoes, feta, balsamic and creamy dressing, and onions. UGH! Want. Right. Now.

Location is perfect, the area was missing a nice roof top patio. It's spacious, full of servers and they're all mad nice.

The only problem is the lineup. Friday night, any time after 6pm - GOOD LUCK getting a seat anywhere in the restaurant, and you can forget about the roof top all together. 

Bar has a huge screen if you wanna watch anything. Usually the main \"event\" (whether it's Friday night football or a big Jay's game) is on the big screen and the rest of the stuff, like cricket...and water polo... are on the tiny screens surrounding it. It's pricey - it's Jack's after all. I would still recommend this if you're anywhere in the Sheppard/Finch area and need a place to get drunk.

Walk off the buzz/calories at Mel Lastman scquare across the street, or get a Starbucks, or hop on the North York Center subway! YAAYYY! Welcome to da hood, sir."}
{"text":"Fun place! Service and food great! if you have time and close by stop in you will enjoy the whole experience. The only minus is it my be time to change the menu or maybe we go too often."}
{"text":"The food is of standard bar-fare quality. I tipped a couple of bucks on take-out, but I didn't get any utensils. The hotel concierge was closed for the night, so I couldn't get a fork. I had to eat a steak, salad, and mashed potatoes caveman style."}
{"text":"After arriving into Toronto, we were hungry and most of the places nearby has an hour wait so we decided that go try Jack Astor's. We had the option of sitting in the outdoor patio and sitting upstairs. We were seated at a booth and our server was Eli B. 

For drinks, we ordered a glass of White Sangria and a Brisk Iced Tea. The White Sangria tasted like lemonade blended with white wine and served with fresh fruit. 

For dinner, we ordered two entrees with add-ons. We requested the food to not be spicy but it was still pretty spicy for us. We ordered Asiago Chicken Bow Ties with Jack's Pan Bread and Garlic Herb Shrimp Pasta with Caesar Salad. The Asiago Chicken Bow Ties consisted of bow tie pasta and semi sun-dried tomatoes in creamy cheese sauce and topped with peppery asiago crusted chicken. The creamy cheese sauce resembled an Alfredo sauce. We really enjoyed the Pan Bread as it was a pull apart, dinner rolls crusted with olive oil, garlic, and herbs and served fresh from the oven on a skillet pan. The Garlic Herb Shrimp Pasta consisted of radiatore pasta, pine nuts and sautéed shrimp in garlicky and mildly spicy tomato sauce that was garnished with parmesan and fresh basil."}
{"text":"I like Jack Astors.  It's not the quality of the food.  The ambiance is nice.  Great for team lunches.  Not expensive, assortement of choices.  Enough energy to keep everyone awake."}
{"text":"A nice pleasant chain which serves a purpose in accommodating large departmental teams. Considering I've only used the establishment for drinks and starters, I hardly consider sufficient material usage to make a fair assessment. We ordered calamari (good), nachos (pleasantly not greasy), chicken wings (didn't like) and sweet potatoe fries (very good). I ordered a ceasar and nothing spectacular. 

I can definitely speak about the wireless access which is absolute rubbish. The signal is neither strong nor powerful to really use your smartphone inside.

This place is great for accommodating work teams who have no discriminating tastes. Otherwise, go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"The chain is a-okay. I ordered the fajita bowl with grilled steak and for some reason, it was such a comforting meal! Well done!

The service was a bit slow. We were a group of 20+. So no penalties for being slow. They made sure we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday for lunch with my coworkers (a large group of 20-ish people). The service was OK. However, one of the servers (I think he was the manager???) was extremely rude and condescending. He made really sarcastic remarks throughout the service, which may have meant to be humour, but it was annoying. 

I ordered the guacamole (knowing that usually jack Astors has subpar food). How can you fuck up guacamole, right? There were huge chunks of avocado in it, so I had to mash it myself. The chips were stale and oily. Overall the food wasn't good at all. 

My coworker also had a hair in his burger AND there was leftover bacon on the table when we first got seated. 

Very disappointed with this location and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The waitress was so rude and rushed me a lot and the steak wasn't medium like I asked. Generally Jack Astros is good but the service was sub par"}
{"text":"Service staff was overwhelmed considering it was the night of a major sporting event. 

Food was a little dull and not overly tasty. 

The Front street location would be a better choice if you're looking for a sports bar."}
{"text":"Location, ambience and service were the only positives. Food?? Microwaved Quesadilla,  extremely battered calamari with questionable marinara sauce and strawberry lemonade for showmanship instead of taste bud execution. Food was below standard. Sweet potato fries where good."}
{"text":"Was hoping for a little more than average bar food.  The service was ok but the food was very average."}
{"text":"Not a fan of chain restaurants, but they just might be okay. 

Came here on a Friday for dinner (was craving me an open faced sandwich). Walked over, and was seated right away for 2 people on the patio for a busy Friday night. 

I got the Lettuce Wraps, a bit over $15 from what I recall. It's on the apps but honestly was more than enough for a whole meal on its own! LOVED it. Not only did I FEEL healthy, but it was essentially I popped chicken, wrapped with lettuce with tangy sweet/sour sauce.  

Service was surprising very attentive and personable. The servers would have a conversation with you and didn't mind that I always had to get another water recluse flies just keep dropping into mine (*sorry again!). 

Overall, great experience and would come back again if a friend suggested. Small tidbit to add: they also events you can rsvp to, in which there are free drinks and food! I attended the End of Summer Bash, and the drinks selection was awesome. Keep in mind you're not there to eat all the free samples, but the drinking doses were fine to me haha. ;)"}
{"text":"This place has a great patio. It was renovated last year. It's a lot of fun in the summer. It draws a great crowd of regulars, especially on Thursdays. It's more lively than Scaddabush next door. The servers are friendly. Inside, it's just like any other Jack Astor's so I don't go there much in the winter or if it's not patio weather."}
{"text":"There's nothing special about Jack Astor's and there never will be. The menu is limited, the prices are high and everything is just standard at best. This is one of the only few places that are live in Scarborough, because there is nothing else to do in the area.

Milestones, Pickle Barrel and Keg are such better choices for the price range."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for supper on a Saturday night. It took 40 minutes to get an entree of the lettuce wraps. The lettuce was not even firm and I was lucky enough to spot bugs in the lettuce. When I told the waitress she was very nice and couldn't believe it. The manager came to see us and said that he was having all the lettuce rewashed. We waited an extra 20 minutes to get out main meal and my boyfriend asked for medium sirloin and got well done. I did not enjoy the night at all and couldn't wait to get out. However, the waitress was really nice about everything and tried to compensate us. But I still would never go back."}
{"text":"Had a pretty good experience at this Jack Astor's location. I had just gotten off the bus so Jack Astor's was one of the closest options for food. Where I was first seated seemed to have a vent above circulating ice cold air. I asked another served and thankfully they were able to switch us to a booth in a warmer section of the restaurant. The service was fine.  Perhaps may have been better if my server had check in with me more than the one time once the food was delivered. My only real complaint is that the French fries weren't hot."}
{"text":"Took literally 15 minutes to get just a pint of beer to my table on a Wednesday night. Mind you there was a hockey game on (Canada vs Euro)??? But still c'mon!!...a beer! A beer!!"}
{"text":"We went here last night with a party of 6. Upon arriving we were told it would take 30 minutes for a table which we were totally fine with as we were coming without reservations. We did our time and we're eventually seated which was great. Upon sitting down we were all given menus and told our waitress would be with us shortly.... what a disaster that was. The place was visibly busy which was fine but we waited for 20 minutes before we finally asked one of the servers walking by for a waitress. She looked at our table to tell us our servers name and that she would be right back after she talked to her. What she didn't realize is we had never been seen!!! They literally forgot about our table!!! The waitress was very nice and said she would take us on as a table. She took all of our orders and service and food was great from there on, but I was mind blown as to how that happened. Definitely an issue worth looking into as management at jack Astros"}
{"text":"Horrible service !!!!! We got drinks and appetizers and no one ever came to check on us if we needed more drinks or we wanted to order foods!!! After 45 minutes of no one coming to check on us I had to get up find someone to just get the bill and leave! Appetizers were delicious tho"}
{"text":"Food was great!
But AWFUL SERVICE.
Honestly don't sit on the bar side because they forget everything you ask for. 
25 mins for the bill, and once we confronted her for taking so long she was very rude! Unfortunately we got the worst waitress !"}
{"text":"Lousy staff. Came here a few weeks ago for an early dinner.
Staff we're going through a shift change, all the staff were a bunch of air heads, not knowing which tables are theirs, etc. 

Finally after 4 minutes of standing around with the servers we asked if we just seat our selves, or will some one bring us to a table?
We were kindly brought to a table, only to have been sitting there for 10 minutes without any service. Restaurant was 10% full...
WTF?

Left without getting anything. Wont be returning. 
Jack Astors, please update your menu as well. Tacky assortment of food."}
{"text":"There was only one two issues with the drinks and the bill, but other then that, it was and had a magician that gave us some puzzles to work out while we waited. Over all a good night and lovely food plating might I add."}
{"text":"Great place. Limited variety of food though. Also they check IDs too many times even though you don't young at all. Kind of embarrassing."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with my Smoking Salmon meal. 

Here is the thing, I bought a huge piece of salmon earlier that day that was 5X as big as the piece I got for the same price....oh but there were other things on the plate....yeah, rice, a few wedges of avocado and less than 10 grape tomatoes. 

It was also over cooked, blackened bottom and all. Gordon would have been pissed. 

It's a sad thing for me that I went SO hungry that I didn't complain then and ate what I was given. 

Also, you over cooked the birthday boys steak...he was that hungry he didn't want to fuss.

Also, you forgot the onion chips in the chicken salad.

Also, the crust on the fish n chips was insanely thick and extremely hard to get though.... Oh wait, there are no chips in that...odd huh? 

It was also too loud, our group had a very hard time actually TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT SHOUTING. We didn't go out to dinner to watch a looped reel on tv ether. 

I was glad to leave before my headache got that bad.  
 

I'll rethink ever going back."}
{"text":"You know those satisfaction surveys usually attached to receipts that enter you in various contests, give you a coupon or just allow you to rant? Well I do those as well lol :-). Following my previous Jack Astor's visit I completed the survey on the receipt; it was in-line with the review I wrote for Jack Astor's here down to mentioning the small seating issue we encountered. (Please see previous review below for a review of our last visit)

What really caught me off guard is that the Manager CJ actually took the time to send me a reply! Given the situation was minor and didn't escalate, I wasn't expecting any sort of response and was just happy to enter a contest. But he thanked me for my survey and went as far as to invite for Game 4 of the Flames/Ducks series with some special arrangements / compliments, WOW! Pretty huge since it's undoubtedly going to be a full restaurant, it was last time! I was trying to think back to a time a manager went above and beyond to take the time and write me like this and I couldn't. I think this is the first time anyone has! Jack Astor's and CJ have definitely earned an ongoing customer in me, this is exceptional service! I had to decline his offer for the game invitation due to prior commitments, but I will be back for a visit (hopefully soon)!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went to this location for the first time with some new friends on a Friday night so we could check out the rooftop patio. We obviously picked the wrong day to go, because it got a bit chilly as the evening wore on. 

Service was very poor, although our server was so nice and friendly. I think he just forgot about us. A lot. There was a mix-up with my meal, and it took a while to correct because he did not come check on us after our food was brought out (by others). Everyone was halfway through their meal before I managed to flag him down. Once I got what I'd asked for, it was quite good. I would've liked another drink, too, but he was nowhere to be found. Some of the girls at the table asked for water, which he also completely zoned out on. 

Could've been a much better experience if our server was on the ball. We likely would've had more to eat and drink, but decided to go somewhere else due to such slow service. I'd probably go back, though, as the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Backtracking a bit, because this was a memorable visit. 
I was here to watch the NBA finals. We like to frequent this Jack Astors, because of their TVs - a swell view by the bar (see picture). 
Unfortunately on this particular night, the service was very slow. It was very difficult to waive down a server and then it took over 45 minutes to receive our orders. When we finally received our drinks, they were flat and warm. My friend even said hers tasted watered down."}
{"text":"This is a big restaurant and I'm surprised how well they run things here despite the external appearance of chaos. I estimate there are 200 seats at this location, and there are waiters and customers walking to and fro continually.

On a very busy weekday evening they took my order accurately (despite the loud environment) and served my food decently fast (~10 minutes). The quality is decent, just standard bar&grill stuff like burgers and fries. Group seating is one of their strong points, being able to accommodate 10 people to a table. There are TVs everywhere to distract you, mostly tuned to sports channels."}
{"text":"I went on Saturday afternoon of the Anime North convention. It was a very busy time, with all restaurants in the nearby area overflowing with people. I was seated promptly, got my food on time, and everything was just went really well, above and beyond what I expected in this situation.

I was super-hungry and visited Boston Pizza first, but I refused them after they said I would expect to wait 30 minutes. Coming in to Jack Astor's, I was pleasantly surprised when the receptionist said they'd seat me as soon as a table opens up (I was eating alone, not in a group). I should emphasize that being accommodated quickly is no easy feat during this convention of ~20 000 people, when even Harvey's and Tim Hortons each have a lineups of ~100 people snaking through the restaurant and out the door.

The waiters/waitresses who came by me were super-friendly and responsive. My food was served in 10 to 15 minutes, and wow the portion size was large for a $15 item. I literally ate just half for lunch and saved half for dinner, which turned out to be convenient.

My only complaint, a relatively minor one, was that their free Wi-Fi system was retarded. It required a password, unlike almost all other restaurants I've been to. When I asked the waitress for access, she kindly gave me a fresh slip of paper with a password that expired in 24 hours, but when I tried it it didn't work. The paper also had a huge-ass EULA saying stuff like (paraphrase) \"we're not computer experts, we can't help you if you have problems connecting, and don't pester the waitress if you have trouble\". But the waitress came back to me asking if I needed help; I said it didn't work and she offered to step through the login process with me, but I simply asked her to issue a new password; she came back with another slip of paper and this time it worked. Please Jack Astor's, don't make your Wi-Fi system so stupid. You're wasting everybody's time.

Anyhow, this experience was really good overall. Five stars awarded."}
{"text":"I visited during their \"soft launch\" and yes, the staff was attentive to the point that we started laughing about it. Lots of staff hanging around doing nothing.
The food was tasty.
But I won't be back. While the men waitstaff wore the usual trousers and Tshirt, the women's uniform was a very short skirt and extremely low cut top. This sort of sexism put me off the whole experience."}
{"text":"When you want to watch \"the game\" this sports bar is pretty hard to top. I've come here a couple times to watch the Blue Jays and the atmosphere is pretty remarkable. They have the massive multi-TV contraption behind the bar, but pretty much anywhere you're sitting you'll get a good view of a screen.

In the few times I've been here the staff have been really nice and efficient. The prices aren't very cheap, but I've come to expect that at any chain restaurant/bar. They have some pretty good beers on tap -- including my current favourite: Muskoka Detour.

If you're looking to catch a sporting event in St. Lawrence Market this would be one of your best bets. When the place is rammed the vibe is electric."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst. The food has gotten so expensive at this particular chain over the years. I mean really, almost $18 for a subpar burger? Get over yourself Jack Astors. Sure this location has a view, but there are SO many better restaurants in this neighborhood, never again. Aside from the mostly negative, the staff is very friendly and attentive, it's not their fault that whoever runs this chain only cares about making a buck."}
{"text":"I visited Jack Astors in London Ontario (a location which I have been to many times before, mostly during the summer, and I have always been pleased). However, this visit was a bit disappointing. I was excited to order my usual favorites (the Asian-style nachos, and/or the perogi poutine) however, I noticed that both had been removed from their menu. I ended up ordering one of their healthier options (the chicken and goat cheese sandwich with a side of house salad) and my boyfriend ordered the Italian burger with fries. The food was meh. My sandwich was decent but my salad had very minimal toppings - only about 4 croutons and 4 halves of tomato. My boyfriend's burger patty was TINY and also appeared burnt and dried up, as was the bun. The fries were very cold and tasted stale as if they had been sitting in the fry basket waiting to be served for several hours. I had also ordered a rum-based drink and was informed that they were all out of the rum so I ordered it with vodka. They were nice enough to remove this from the bill, so that was an unexpected surprise. The hostess and the server were also very nice. Overall, I was disappointed that their portions have shrunk so noticeably and also the food was somewhat disappointing in flavor and presentation."}
{"text":"It's a Jack Astors like most. Corporate run restaurants means the quality can be and should be expected to be about the same across the different locations. It's just the service that differs. This place 5 star service everytime! I will say, Beth, our server last last time, though clearly swamped, made sure we were checked up on, and she was super friendly and really offered honest opinions on what dishes she'd recommend based on what we were looking to eat. Really friendly staff who clearly knows her way around FOH, so I hope they do recognize her for it :) same for Quinn who served us this time. He was really friendly and checked up on us just enough not to rush us but remind us of how friendly the staff are here! Please recognize your FOH team!! On busy nights, the hostess writes the time you're seated on the paper too, so I think thats a really smart way to control the timing and make sure they're keeping track of their seating and turn over can go smoother!

We started with the calamari which comes with an aoili and also a slightly spicy seafood sauce. The aoili is creamy and a bit citrus-y, while the seafood sauce is very powerful and tangy. I liked having the two sauces to switch between or dip together (i know.. monstrosity!). The calamari is a generous portion and not over breaded. We actually enjoyed this app the most!

I've had the Holy Smokes bbq Burger before and it's about the same. I like how they stack it up with the fried onions inside. The fries are a bit bland, but that's why we got ketchup! haha

My boyfriend had the Steak Frites. Steak was cooked a bit dry, but not horribly so. It comes with fries that are topped with parmesan and I think they put truffle oil on there. Truffle oil is a bit over powering, but overall, I actually like these fries. Don't have to go dipping them into ketchup or anything. :) 

Try the tuna sesame rice bowl. I had that another time and it was delicious!

I do like to try different places in PIckering since I mostly just visit once a week or so. But if you're looking for a safe bet, Jack Astors is a good stop. Do try to arrive a bit earlier though.. by Saturday 6:45pm, they were already packed!"}
{"text":"Gotta love their brie burgers here! Been here a few times and the service has been consistent. The take it's has been quick. And the restaurant is quite clean.

I do with it were quieter though and all the times I've visited the washroom on my visits, there's never any toilet paper in over half the stalls.... 

The servers really deserve some praise. They are funny, spirited, and just over all an extremely friendly bunch of people! Even when the dish is taking a long time, they aren't afraid to let us know and check up on us just to make sure we're updated. :) well trained in my opinion, but I might just be getting all the nice ones. Haha"}
{"text":"where the heck did the nachos go?

are you guys on crack!

that was your best appetizer"}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd expect. Not bad, not great. Food is decent, beer wasn't particularly cold. Service was OK."}
{"text":"Food was great and service was prompt. Atmosphere was spoiled by an alarm going off in the kitchen every 2 minutes, loud enough to be heard throughout the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner with some friends before heading over to the Skydome for a show.  The hostess led me to a table, but then I was pretty much ignored by the person waiting in my section of the restaurant until the hostess brought my friend over (about 10 minutes later).  I spent those ten glorious minutes of being ignored by drawing pictures with the crayons they provided at the table...

The waitress took our orders quickly and then disappeared for a good chunk of the night.  This was a little bit problematic because we were running on a schedule and needed to get our bills and pay.  She said she would \"come right back\" with the machine and disappeared again for ten minutes.  We're not too sure whether it was because she was working another section but we couldn't even see her when we looked around the restaurant.

Food could've been better.  Got the grilled chicken salad and the piece of chicken was very, very small.  My friends got the hot wings (10) and sweet potato fries and it was just very salty... The price tag is pretty steep for these small portions...

Probably wouldn't come back again.  We couldn't manage to get a reservation to any of the restaurants along Front Street, which is why we ended up here..."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner (a large group of about 24 people) and I think we were the cause of slowing down the kitchen (lol).  Anyway, we waited for a while for everyone's mains but overall the food was good.  Servers were somewhat attentive that evening, since they needed reminders to refill our cups of water.  Overall, the food's good and the atmosphere is great for parties."}
{"text":"Nice, fun place.

In the main restaurant area, they have a sheet of paper as the tablecloth - and they give you crayons, anyone up for tic tac toe while you are waiting for your food.

Food - pretty good grub.  Try the chicken pizza.  Thin crust, good toppings, yum.    Would not recommend the caesar.  Stick with a beer.

Lots of random stuff to look at in the restaurant - cartoons, and elvis memorabilia... and tvs in the lounge."}

Comments
- The environment here is amazing - Patio, tv's everywhere, ample amount of seating and an good vibe/atmosphere.
- Service is horrible - took them a really long time to bring us our drinks.  Our food arrived faster then our drinks. (I think this is due to low staff count)
- parking is a pain (street meter parking), but there's a big green P parking lot a block south."}
{"text":"I love Jack Astor's, it's one of best Canadian chains to actually serve decent food and the prices are pretty reasonable. I have been too alot of locations, from Halifax to Toronto and I have to say, this is one on top of my favourite Jack's location.

The servers are all friendly and on top of things, especially Nick. He is super friendly and very observant. He notices even before you have to ask for another refill to bring you another glass. He also always gets the order right.

I love the chicken fingers here, they are never frozen and super tasty. The steak fajita is also excellent but I like my meat cooked and they serve it medium-well and alot of times it will come out pretty raw, which I could never consider eating and if you ask for well done then you usually end up with an overcooked fajita.. Sooo I just chance it and if it needs a little extra cooking then I just get them to throw it back on the grill.

I love love love the garlic pan bread! It's sooo good and very addictive, I could eat one or two myself! 

Jack's has a very nice atmosphere. I like the stack of TVs they have around the dining room. It's different and unique. They also have some flat screens in the bar so it's a great place to come and watch a sports game if you like sports or just a nice place to bring some friends and have a drink.

Bonus: they accept SPC Card which gives you 15% off your meal!"}
{"text":"I don't know how to give a star rating on this location, I was in between 2-3 stars but since more then half of the times I have gone to this location are horrific, I think a 2 star is being generous.

I did however experience one of the best steaks here, on a busy weekend night, go figure! So when I decided to go back on a Monday night you would think the same meal could be duplicated, ummm think again!

Absolutely everything came out wrong, so backwards you would not believe and the place was barely busy..

Asked for the mushrooms on the side, of course they came ON the steak and the fried onions were put on the side instead. I personally would not have got the mushrooms at all but the boyfriend likes them and ordered the same steak so he  wanted my mushrooms, no problem for me as long as they are nowhere near my food!

Now for his steak, he ordered the bigger size (10oz) medium-well and it came out blood pink! umm, no thinks I think I will pass and don't even bother getting it put back on the grill because it will still come out wrong!

Now back to my steak that was re-made. I usually never want to get my food re-made because it will always be cooked rushed, even when you tell them not to rush it because you just want it right, like it should have been the first time. Of course the steak came out like a hockey pock the second time around and we ended up not having dinner and just cutting our loses...

You can take your chance, but 9 times out of 10 it will be wrong..

Oh hey, they are coming out with yet another menu change on the 20th of this month (October 2015) and are removing more of the popular items like the steak fajita after finally switching back to flank steak from sirloin (who wants a sirloin fajita?) I am so looking forward to the change, ummm yeah, right...."}
{"text":"I keep going back to this location for lack of anywhere else to go that is close by...

Not anymore, I must stay away, I must!

Jack's has always been one of those places where everything either goes really well or everything goes completely wrong...

I stayed away from Jack's when I found out they removed the steak fajita (which on my last visit I discovered they brought it back 

(more on that later)

Over the years most of my favourite items have been removed, including the delicious sweet chilli chicken fingers! Yes they still have chicken fingers but it just isn't the same without the sweet chilli sauce...

I will hopefully never return to this location, but again sometimes life happen and it is what it is... 

This location when it first opened seemed to have their shit together, not so much anymore. I believe everyone who was originally here is no longer and things have taken a spiral.

I always find especially with Jack's that unless they write your order down, it will not come out correctly. The server on my most recent visit seemed rather lost but even if she was amazing it wouldn't have changed what happened next ...

Now back to that steak fajita, after eating one fajita and onto making a second one I noticed a big long black strand of hair right in the middle of the fajita that I was currently in the process of making its way to my mouth. I'm so thankful I noticed before closing the wrap and entering my mouth. I was so grossed out as I already ate from that skillet and when I looked down I noticed MORE HAIR in the skillet! 

The whole steak fajita was filled with hair! Sometimes you end up with hair unfortunately in your food but someone's whole head of hair in my food? Wtf? ...

The manager could have cared less, which made matters worse and actually said that she checked and made sure the hair wasn't mine? Seriously?

It was like a scene from a nightmare or something. Usually Jack's has pretty cool managers but I guess because of where this location is, this isn't the case.

Take the extra few minutes and go to the location at Don Mills. Unless hair is your thing..."}
{"text":"I love Jack Astors food, especially the pan garlic bread, it has lots of flavour and is just amazing! 

On a typical Friday or Saturday there is always a wait for a seat but is never too long. 

Our waitress last night was super on top of the ball, except the pop came back diet but it seems everywhere we ask for lime they assume it's diet because alot of restaurants use that to tell the difference between regular and diet.

I had the steak, it was my first time trying it, it comes with two sides, the baked potato was huge and good and the steak was OK, wasn't excellent but wasn't a steakhouse either.

My boyfriend got the steak fajita like he always does, and it was excellent. It is always a hit and miss, sometimes it's really delicious and other times it barely has the meat cooked. 

I also find that MOST of the Jack locations are the same but then there are a couple who seem to follow their own ways the food is similar but not the same..

Overall, this location always seems to be great!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm giving Jack Astors a 3 star rating. 

I haven't been to one in years, but we were desperate to find a patio at 11pm on a Monday night and there were not a lot of options. 

Service was quite good. They now have a reasonable wine selection and some more interesting beers on tap.

My food wasn't even terrible. I tried the grilled lamb kebabs, which came with 4 mini-pitas, some hummus,  tzatziki and a diced tomato salad. It was only $13. I really can't complain, the meat was tasty. I'm sure it did come frozen from a box then placed on a grill, but oh well. Georgie also enjoyed his sandwich.

Overall, I would never return here, but surprisingly it wasn't a bad experience. 

Clientele are mostly tourists."}
{"text":"A lot of deep fry here as to be expected from a Pub. Not many options aside from burgers, or steak. Lots of beer though. Located close to the Hotel we were at. I have been here several times. I wanted healthier options for food but didn't want to walk that far this night. If you want to good Pub atmosphere, this is a good place. If you want a nice meal with fresher products,maybe not."}
{"text":"On a recent business trip, I had my mind set on food...but work gets in the way and GTA traffic is terrible (IDK how citizens of Toronto deal with it!!!).  After discovering the establishment I wanted to dine at was closed for remodel...we wandered our way to JA (literally across the parking lot!).  

It was a little later in the evening, so finding a seat wasn't difficult.  This place reminded me of Champps back home, plenty of TVs on the walls, loud, smell of onion rings and plenty of adult bevs being poured.  

We were in Canada (darn Americans!) and had to get classic poutine and wings...c'mon, you can never go wrong with wings, yeah?!  The poutine showed up looking like it was put into a Chinese take-out container, cooked and dumped out of the box...keeping it's box form; yeah, that happened.  It was alright, but I'm sure there were much better versions out there.  The wings were your oh-so-typical wings you find at any sports bar in North America...nothing to write home about. 

I love burgers (who doesn't?) and landed on the Holy Smoke BBQ Burger, topped with smoke bacon, BBQ sauce, BBQ pulled pork, friend onions and banana peppers, YES!!!  So, what I perceived as amazing on paper, i.e. the trusty menu, showed up as something not so thrilling.  The beef was bland, pulled pork was somehow lumpy...how is that possible?!  Overall, not amazed, but I was hungry and needed nourishment...down the hatch!

Find another place to drop a couple loonies..."}
{"text":"We went here on a wed and it wasn't too busy some reason the service was so slow and the food was horrible the calamari was super dry so was my deluxe burger, the pasta shrimp was bland also the worst Cesar cocktail I ever tasted. I don't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Loved the food awesome service . Their poutine was excellent. We shared enterees and they went the extra mile by giving us separate portions . Sangria was also amazing ."}
{"text":"The food is really good here. We got the putine and it's really good. I would definitely recommend this place, we were having a hard time finding good restaurants in Toronto, we got lucky on this one"}
{"text":"Upon arriving in Toronto, I asked the concierge for a recommendation.  He pointed to \"pub row\".  Little did I know that Jack Astor's was a Toronto staple, versus a unique pub. Well...

We were welcomed, and taken on a little spin, as the host tried to figure out where best to seat us.  Outside was too cold, but most of the inside was too dark.  He could sense this and found a table in an apparently busy area that was well-lit.  Problem being, a lot of folk, or a few large parties had just left.  The place was a mess!  It took a few to get service.  But once we got service...

Our server had a pleasant attitude, and apologized for the delay and the party leftovers.  It took he and his colleagues the whole time we were there to clean the area, but alas...he took our order.  We were famished!  We thought we could eat appetizers and a meal.  I'm glad we ordered in parts.  We ended up eating only the appetizers.

We ordered riblets and macho nachos.  My guest expected the riblets to be like America's Applebee's ( because she didn't read, just name recognition), but they were basically little pork chops with lemon pepper seasoning. Delicious surprise.  The macho nachos with beef chili? Too much.  Without chili would have been good, as there were so many jalapeños on it, my mouth was lessening an appetite.

So we missed the chicken strips they're known for, as well as the fish 'n chips.  But there's always tomorrow."}
{"text":"Despite being surrounded by more expensive \"fancy\" restaurants Jack always provides great food and great service. The chicken dippers are still the best in town. A must do Canadian experience."}
{"text":"I have been going to Jack Astors Willowdale since its opening April fools day 2013.  Firstly the female and male staff at the bar downstairs ( street level) are excellent and within going their twice they knew my name.  I have had dinner there on 3 occasions.  The food arrives fast however I prefer the bar on the main level for quick attention and service personified. I was saddened to learn this past week that Shabana was no longer with Jack Astors at the bar main floor.  Excellent with all the customers.  Would like to know the reason.  As an entrepreneur and having opening a licenced restaurant in my 20's and founded one of the top fine dining catering companies in Toronto , I should be the worst critic.  Yonge and Sheppard needed Jack Astors.  Most of the places in the area are overpriced for low quality food, and most places the service sucks other than St Louies. Trevor Jones."}
{"text":"They changed it alot since last time. It looks much nicer. The menu is still very nice. I absolutely love their food it perfect pair up with a good drink. Especially the fries. The staff have amazing energy and vibrant personalities! I would always ask for Josee's (Joe) section. She is by far my favorite waitress."}
{"text":"I am so glad for this chain. 
We were in dilemma (when Alice Fazoolis turned out to  be a flop ) on where we should go for our bi-weekly drinks. Around the area there didn't seem to be much to choose from and by fluke (well, my friend had a crush on a waitress there- and my opinion of the chain is fairly good since I did work for Jack's once) we ended up here.

Thank goodness for Jack's. 
The waitstaff here is ultra friendly - they actually will have a conversation with you - it's more likely that they're conversing with you to increase their tip share - it's a good tactic because it almost always woks -and all you gotta do is humour them. 

We had a great birthday dinner here and have moved our drinking night to their spacious patio with staff that smile when they bring you your nom noms."}
{"text":"I've no idea why but this Jack Astor's seems to have upped its game a bit and appears to be a wee bit swankier.  Is it because it's landed in a restaurant row on Front Street in Toronto?  Is it because of the heritage that surrounds it in the Royal York (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-fairmont-royal-york-toronto) and Union Station (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/union-station-toronto)?  Truly, who cares?  It's a Jack Astor's.

It's much dressier inside than several other Jack Astor's that I've been to (and I've been to my share).  There is a long central bar that provides the focus for the room, probably well designed for the commuters looking for a quick after-work drink before they hit the Go Trains or subways home.  The table spaces are decent and in the nice weather, they've got a great patio with an outside bar for faster service.  In the cold weather, they've got a great smoking section.

The menu is similar to most every Jack Astor's that I've had the pleasure of being in so there's no surprise there.  Outside of the fact that the inside décor appears to have been downtown-Torontoed-up a bit."}
{"text":"I love jack Astor's!!! This place has so many vegetarian options and the food is great. Garlic pan bread is sooooooo good and so are the fajitas. You can make your own fajitas. Comes with lettuce, salsa, sour cream, sautéed onions, peppers, cheddar cheese and a protein of your choice if you want. For veggie lovers they have tofu! Nachos are alright, I've had better but still not too bad. It needs more cheese. Sweet potato fries are so yummmyyy and not oily at all which I liked! Very spacious and clean area."}
{"text":"Omg the worst burger I have ever had in my life, can you say no cheese even offered by the bar tender, attitude all the way, the beer was warm, no cold mugs, say what!?!?! Ok, the safe way, get me a coke then, holy s@&&it! It's flat and a warm glass."}
{"text":"It's definitely a fun place to be, with really good food! Very loud though, so don't expect to have any meaningful conversations. The burgers are great, so is the steak. Don't get the nachos, they're salty AF (no but really)!b"}
{"text":"Went here with a bunch of friends after a celebration late one night. Had to pay for parking, not a big deal.

Was impressed by the way they handled their seating arrangements, they have beepers for when a table is ready, kind of like a pager. I've seen this before at a few other restaurants and in Orlando, Florida - at Disney World.

I was seated and ordered a steak, the steak was very dry, not what I expected and service was REALLY slow. I asked for the steak to be cooked medium rare and it was well done. Now, I'm not one to be very picky but I believe if you're paying good money for something, it should be something YOU WANT. A friend of mine ordered the Pad thai noodles and had a huge portion, too bad it tasted disgusting.

Along with the bad food, the waitress was very oblivious to the fact we were trying to get another drink or get the bill. - Insulting enough, this is one of those restaurants where they're really slow at getting everything... except the bill.

I've been here twice and had two bad experiences, the most recent experience I'm writing about.

I wouldn't recommend this to a friend. 2/5"}
{"text":"If you would rather look at the hot hostesses, sit in the lounge side .... and that was the advice given to us over the phone .... and it's true.

OK onto the food.

Drink: Soda Float. Served with some high quality vanilla ice cream (you could see the tiny vanilla bean bits in the foam.  Served with a specialty house brand of either Root Beer or cream soda (neither flavour is palatable to me). I chose to switch it up with orange to make a creamsicle flavour. 

Appetizer:  Calamari.  Although it costs almost as much as some entrées, its almost a meal unto itself (if you don't eat that much).  They are not your average \"onion ring\" style you get at some cheap places.  Tentacle pieces are cut in such a way that they are only recognizable as tentacles because they are not rings.  They come lightly breaded and served with both a creamy garlic sauce, and the standard cocktail sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed the dish, but wish there was a better sauce, they both seemed kind of standard.  I would have them again, as they are near the top for stuff in T.O.

Main: Chicken Fried Chicken (Retro Festival) How could i not try a dish that's almost impossible to find in T.O.? as it arrived at the table I almost regretted getting the calamari.  There were two GIANT pieces of chicken breast, smothered in gravy, fries, and a small garlic bread.

Fries - BOO.  tastes like McCain.  Not really cooked enough.  Not burn your mouth hot, more like just warm enough to eat.

Chicken - covered in a [peppercorn?] SUPER-THICK gravy. Not my style of gravy.  Do i take out the first \"chicken\" in \"chicken fried chicken\" if i don't want the gravy?  Chicken was crispy [where there was no gravy] moist and tender.  One note: the under side didn't look anything like the top. If Mike Holmes was eating it he would have looked at the breading and said \"if its worth doing, it's worth doing right\". There was enough breading on one side though to make up for the almost naked back.

Garlic Bread - almost an after thought.  A piece of a larger loaf is stuffed into a container and made to look like a mini version. There was a liquid in the bottom, mixed with a garlicky salty paste.  It tasted garlicky, and odd at the same time.

Butter Chicken - was apparently good as well. Serving size was not nearly as HUGE as the CFC.

Dessert: 
Cheesecake looked, and was apparently good as well. Not overly rich. 
Ridiculously small brownie was small, but looked tasty and a good value at $.96

VERDICT:
After 12 hours I am still full from my lunch.  WOW.  I don't think i was this full even after a trip to the Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Meh... big corporate dinner. We got some free applies because they messed up the reservation. The meals were OK.  I found my bourbon shrimp tasted more like it was soaked in a mild salsa sauce which also weirded out the taste of the steak for me.

When I saw that if came with grilled ship I didn't expect a salsa sauce soaking into everything. The steak was blue but still quite tough. Taste wise it was OK but had a big chunk of impervious grisel.

I also had a vodka martini and found it very small for what it was but tasted OK. 

All in all everyone enjoyed dinner but no one raved about anything.

I did think the staff worked hard to make us comfortable and happy and I'd give them a 10 for that."}
{"text":"This location... Forget it! 
Don Mills Centres- so much better!!!!

Came here yesterday and everything I ordered came out cold like from the fridge, cold mash potatoes, cold soup :| and cold chicken fingers ! was no one working in the kitchen last night was everything just microwaved for 2 mins?
Service?? expect none... bill you better go and punch out your own bill cause you'll have to wait forever to get it. 

the 4 tables sitting in a section were all annoyed."}
{"text":"15m wait for empty bar?!
Dunno what was going on that night but it was pretty lame."}
{"text":"My experience at this particular location ranges from odd to horrible.

The first time I ate here, I ordered the burger and it arrived without the bottom bun. Strange, but they apologized and brought a corresponding bun to fix the mistake. No big deal, more weird than anything.

Second time me and a co-worker showed up awhile waiting for other co-workers before a movie. Ordered our beers. Two more of the group arrived and ordered their beers. Their beers arrived before my friend and I's, which take 45 min to arrive. We speak to the waitress, who says it's busy. (It was busy, but not that busy). We order food. The second part of the group who had already received their beers orders their food afterwards, yet still get's it first (it should be noted that I ordered pizza and my friend ordered chicken fingers. Neither take long to cook). Are promised our beers will get comped to make up for slow service and are offered waters in the meantime (not a great consolation prize). Water takes 35 minutes to arrive. I call over manager one last time and inform him no one will be paying for their food or drink. He agrees, we ask for the rest of the food to go. Wait 25 minutes and finally just walk out. Worst experience ever at a Jack's. Total time spent here for no good reason: about 3 hours.

Don't go here. Most definitely not worth the trip"}
{"text":"My wife and I were there last week Oct 20 to meet up with a friend that was in town. Service was great food was good. We were having a good time and about to leave when I went to the washroom. As I'm using the urinal I see 3 cockroaches racing up the wall. That totally ruined my night. Didn't even bother saying anything about. Owners must not care if it gets to that point. Totally disgusted by that especially from jack Astors. Will not be going there ever again. And I hope other Jack Astors are better than this one."}
{"text":"We were seated right away, and had our drink order taken right away. We ordered the veggie burger( chickpea patty and lots of salt) , cheeserburgers, fajitas. It was good food , better than other jack locations. The reason why i docked stars is the fact that while we just started our soups and apps the mains came on the table so by the time we started eating those they were cold and meh!  They need to correct the issue of plopping everything out on the table at once as it is annoying!! No one likes cold fries and burgers!    Second visit after a few days edit as i was in the area for a raptors game and the service was incredible, got seated right away and the food was divin3! Had the beer cheddar soup , a garlic cheesy bread and the cheddar lover pasta with chicken and bacon crumble and it was soooo delicious!!!  So my innitial 3 star is now a solid 5!! Will be back when there for events for sure!!!"}
{"text":"boy was the service tonite lousy and the food horrendous as well... i got the pulled pork burger it said in the menu it would come with some caramelized onions and slices of cheese it came out looking like a messy pile of onions a pickle slice, some big mac like sauce instead of the so called cheese slices and some bits of dried bacon... oh and waaayy too salty!! i do not think i'll return... oh and the server took forever to bring us some lousy drinks.. he was on slow and very slow mode and too busy flirting with some chicks at a different table..."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé stopped by for a quick bite. We had completely forgot it was St. Patrick's day .. So the place was packed. Being that the service was extremely quick! We ordered fish & chips and had it within 15 minutes. It wasn't bad but pretty good for a place like this. Over all we enjoyed our visit and will probably drop by again."}
{"text":"This is one of my fave Jacks. The bartenders usually put on a show behind the bar, and once they know you, they never forget you!

The food is average, not really worth the money, but the beers are always cold and tasty!

We sat on the patio last time, and they view is fab."}
{"text":"When I lived in Toronto, I frequented Jack's at Dundas. This would be one of the best Jack Astors I have ever been to. The bartenders knew my name, always had a beer ready for me by the time I sat down, poured me another before the first was empty, and there is a sweet patio overlooking Dundas Square (no I am not an alcoholic)!

So right off the hop, I had high expectations...

This Jack's is seriously lacking personality. I can't put my finger on it, but there is no charisma. The servers seem fake and bored for the most part. The service is always promt, but lacking umph. 

The food is pretty good, not outstanding, but better than most casual sit-down places. I prefer the lounge, as they have plenty of TV's to catch you up on the game.

Overall, it's fine. If you've never been to a better Jack's, this place might rock your world."}
{"text":"We were in Toronto on a family vacation and had a so-so meal at an average Italian restaurant the night before. The boys (14, 12 and 9) wanted burgers  and I wanted a better meal (my wife is vegetarian so that can present menu challenges at times). Jack Astor's was great. The server Michael was outstanding, the menu was varied and I would characterize it as upclassed bar food (burgers with really good buns, vegetarian options, great sweet potato fries). I had the chicken roadkill sandwich and it was great as well. Lots of TVs with sports on and bloopers which kept the boys laughing and occupied.  I think we got lucky as it was a slow night, otherwise it looked like the place could be packed and has a really cool patio,"}
{"text":"Service has always been great and the food is good too (not great as in 5 star renowned chef - but good). I have tried many things on their menu and liked them all. 

My last visit was for a closed to the public company function. I got a little hammered taking advice from one of the drink relocation engineers (lemonade beer with a shot) - considering I don't drink often or much - two of these contributed to me losing  my phone- dancing in public- and other unmentionables. No she didn't over serve me - she made a great recommendation and I wasn't driving... no regrets :-0

The staff and manager went well above their job functions to secure my phone (found in a cab by an employee 30 minutes after I took the cab back to the hotel) to keep it safe until I coordinate a pick-up.  How did the employee know it was mine or from our party? I have no idea - I think it was luck on my part. Through my co-workers and JA staff we were able to coordinate my phone being sent back to Texas."}
{"text":"Jack Astors. Oh dear. Overpriced menu, same old food and drink. 

The only thing that is good about this location is the big patio that looks over Dundas square. And if you dig sports, you can watch a game here. So yeah, it gets the job done but there are better places to go hang out."}
{"text":"Busy place.  Friendly staff.  Cold beer. Tasty burger.  Would recommend.  Lots of TVs to watch the games."}
{"text":"Good place to go before and after the game or to watch one.  Bar is noisy and the food is just ok.  wonderful paper tablecloths with crayons to write with."}
{"text":"A decent fast-food restaurant. We were seated right away and had a good experience. The best part of this restaurant is its name!! The lettuce wrap was yummy and the blackened chicken salad was pretty good as well. The servers were very attentive."}
{"text":"Jack astors has been my go to place lately. Many of my friends and I have been playing catch up these few months and I always suggest coming to this Jack Astors.

The main reason for always coming here is surprisingly because of their steak. I know, it sounds crazy, but for a chain restaurant they have GREAT steaks. Now I've only ever tried The Classic, so I can't really say much for the other steaks on the menu.  

Jack Astors has once again changed their menu for the 100th time but luckily for me, it's in my favour! Up until a few weeks ago The Classic would make you choose between a 7oz steak and 11oz (I believe). Then you'd have the option to add veggies for an extra $3 something. NOW, for the same price of $22 something, The Classic offers you a 7oz steak, garlic mash (which I prefer more than the loaded mash) AND veggies. Score for me! Let me tell you, they always cook my steak to my exact liking (medium) and 4/5 times, the steak has not been chewy. You know, chain restaurants can tend to have low quality chewy steaks, but not here. Kudos Jack Astors. If you're on a budget but craving a good quality steak, this is your place.

On my most recent visit I also decided to get the brownie baked inside of a cookie for dessert. Because I am a fatty, I HAD to add ice cream to this. How can you have a warm cookie and brownie without ice cream? Preposterous! It was only an extra dollar to add ice cream. YOLO. I ended up only eating the middle part of the cookie aka where the brownie was. The edges were slightly over cooked and hardened a little too fast. I'm not a fan of hard crunchy cookies. Anyways, the soft parts I ate were delicious and with the ice cream it was perfection. It sucks I had to waste half the cookie though.

Like I mentioned before they've changed up their menu so if you weren't a fan before, there might be something now to your liking. Although I find their menu pretty diverse already. And of course, try the steak!"}
{"text":"Decent food. But compare to another jack Astor location it's not as good. Good pub atmosphere. Lots of families w young children and lots of birthday celebrations. I can tell that the staff really cared to make the birthday star feel special. Was there during a big leafs game and the crowd was pumped. Our server came to ask us if we wanted dessert menu when we were obviously still finishing our food. I understand because they were really busy. She did say take your time but I got the hint. Plus there were staff that kept walking around w an iPad to check on all the tables to mark where everyone is in their dinner so they can plan, which was kind of annoying in my opinion. What upset me was when they brought the ice cream to our kids, they gave them plain vanilla flavour. My younger son does not like plain vanilla ice cream so he took two bites and didn't want it anymore. When the waitress came to give us the bill she asked why he didn't finish. I told her because at the other location they offered either chocolate or caramel drizzle, which my son loved. She replied \"oh! I could've done that!\" But failed to offered it to him even though the ice cream wasn't even melted yet. Oh well. I understand, they were busy. I'd go back again for its food. All the staff were friendly, young and energetic. However need a bit more training on guest service."}
{"text":"It is what it intends to be. Good food (never frozen), friendly staff,  reasonable prices.  Staff are very accommodating to families with young children (we have 2 1/2 yo twins) and the kids menu is varied and the food delicious.  Great value for the family,  and great bar for after-work drinks.  For free WiFi,  just ask a server for the code."}
{"text":"Great Place to watch a Sporting Event with Friends! Had a Holy Smokes Burger w/ Fries and it was Enjoyable! Not the Best Burger I've had but it was still Good! I would defently come back to this location to watch Sporting Events and Hang with Friends!"}
{"text":"That was very unfortunate that Keith had such a negative experience. My husband got some gift certificates for Christmas and we went for our first visit, for lunch, a couple of weeks ago. We found our waitress very friendly and I was impressed by the large selection the menu offered. The food was excellent and as we are both trying to do the healthier eating thing, I was glad to see some good options other than the usual battered/deep fried everything. 

All in all it was a very good experience and as we still have some money left on the certificates, we will definitely be going back. 

I really think that Keith should give them another chance. Maybe your wait staff that day were having a bad day or they were just a**holes but I do understand how one bad experience does tend to turn you off for good."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend took me to jack Astros for our monthly date night which I was going to order my favourite \"chicken Cobb salad\" but I was quick to find out that they have changed their menu offering half the items and my go to was no where to be found...  I asked if they could make it and they insisted they did not have the ingredients to make it possible. Although I see all the ingredients on the menu they were unable to complete my simple order.   I don't think I will be back until they learn some customer service or until the chicken Cobb salad is back on the menu!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I both brought our hearty appetite to this place last night. Personally, I had not been to any Jack Astor's since my university days...we'll not mention exactly how long ago that was.

We were afraid of how long we were going to have to wait based on the lack of parking available in their fairly big parking lot. But we were in fact able to be seated immediately, after an unexpected walk through the restaurant while the woman was finding us an empty table.

Fairly limited menu in comparison to other bars and grills. Only one page. Both my friend and I went for our favourite items on the menu and ordered the bow-tie chicken and I ordered the chicken parmigiana. Both were delicious, well cooked, and had a hint of heat. For dessert, we shared a 'my cookie ate my brownie' and it was warm and gooey. I give them full marks for the creativity of the name and that dessert concept.

Servers were friendly and attentive despite the busy atmosphere. The place was SO loud but I wasn't expecting much to the contrary on a Saturday night and by the time we left there was a long line out the door.

But for a chain: they were clean, friendly and certainly met my expectations for a Jack Astor's."}
{"text":"For years I've had a love/hate relationship with the Jack Astor's franchise. I love the 'idea' of going there but then order something and remember I generally can't tolerate the food.

Today, I tried this location while joining some of my extended family for dinner. The decor of this location shoots the others in the...never mind.

This one appears to move slightly away from the sports bar theme and more towards the family friendly bar environment. So much so, that the sports fans in the group spent most of the time in the bar where they could see the televisions best.

Unlike most of my experiences at JA's, as mentioned above, this food was delicious. I had their chicken and goat cheese sandwich which was very flavourful! However, the goat cheese flavour presides over all others, so if you don't like goat cheese it's not the item to order. As a side, I ordered poutine (diet out window for the day). It was divine!

This location and our server were so friendly and compromising that it made for an overall pleasant dining experience. They know how to cater to families Ina way that keeps both kids and adults happy.

Definitely a good option from the many restaurants that are on the Queensway."}
{"text":"Short version: Be wary of the opinion of anyone who gives Jack Astor's anything above a 3 star. It means they're either easily impressed, or they're possibly an employee. Even 3 stars is generous, because J. Astor's is the culinary and customer service equivalent of a limp handshake.

[rant]

We ended up at Jack Astor's because it was late and my companions mentioned that it was one of the restaurants that would still be open. It's very busy; having now tried it, I cannot for the life of me figure out why. I got the Señor Jack's Jalapeño burger. The menu description mentions jalapeños three times and also mentions hot chili sauce. Yet, it tasted like it was drowned in sweet relish. It was poorly made, messy, cold, and a terrible burger in every sense. It was also $14.00. I don't know if this is normal for you Canadians, but that's some serious bamboozlement if you're spending $14.00 for what is no better than a burger from A&W. Actually, that's an insult to A&W burgers. My dining companions got the Hold the Beef Burger, and the Cluckin' Fresh Chicken Fingers. The HTB Burger got a shrug, and the Cluckin' Fresh was Cluckin' burned (burnt for you lovely Canucks). 

Service was practically nonexistent. We saw our waiter lady person when she took our order. After that, she vanished. She wasn't even the one who brought the food to us, and she never once checked on us during our meal. We saw her again only after I started snapping my fingers (like only a rude American would) in the hopes of getting the attention of someone so we could get out of there. Then she hovered while I paid and calculated how much to tip for the terrible service. Is that a common thing by the way? Standing there and waiting to see how much you get tipped? 

Meh food = \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" Throw in the ridiculous markup on the aforementioned meh food as well as the incredibly sub-par service, and dropping the rating to \"Eek! Methinks not\" seems very appropriate. Jack Astor's is an appropriate name, because I felt like one for dropping $50.00+ at this establishment. Considering all of the amazing dining options you have in Toronto/Mississauga, there should be no reason you end up here. Even if everything else is closed, go to a grocery store and slap something together using random ingredients and I can almost guarantee that it'll be a more satisfying (and significantly cheaper) experience. Go here if you want to end your night with feelings of regret and frustration.

{"text":"I had a nice chicken sandwich and salad for lunch here. There are lots of TVs around showing sports and silly shows. I had great service and the portions were filling. There is a special lunch menu in addition to the all day menu. 

I would eat here again when I return to town."}
{"text":"I came here based on the recommendation of my hotel front desk staff.  It is a chain type sports bar and grill.  Lots of sports on - very hockey heavy when I was there which was fun.  They have a large menu with everything you'd expect. The friendly staff is attentive and food came up in a reasonable amount of time. Large portions and the food was as good as expected.  The poutine was great and filled me up, so I ended up taking the club sandwich I ordered as an entrée back to the hotel.  The sandwich was pretty good, aside from the amount of mayo on it!  I notice this trend in Canada and have to order light mayo.
This would be a great place to watch a game or grab dinner when staying by the airport."}
{"text":"10oz Steak classic. Smokey BBQ burger. BLT poutine. All great. Good job Kyle. Great atmosphere relaxed and casual. Lots of interesting things to look at and lots of TV's."}
{"text":"Jack Astor's is not the best. I regularly frequent it only out of convenience and familiarity. Side note the chips with lobster cheese dip is where its at my friend if you're wondering what the best thing they have on the menu is."}
{"text":"To update my prior review: 

Buns are pre-buttered so if you are dairy free or prefer to opt out of dairy products, know that there are not any decent vegan options here!! The only option was a fajita bowl which came so empty since there was not meat. We wanted the veggie burger but there were not other options for buns that did not contain butter for a dairy free individual. It's a very common and reasonable request to have no butter added to a bun. Even somewhere like McDonald's is able to accommodate that! Not sure why a chain as large as Jack Astors is able to have a gluten free menu but isn't able to offer alternatives for dairy free customers. We have beeen ordering the veggie burger for years and always requested \"dairy free\". Not sure why no staff member was competent enough to realize that butter is a dairy product. Not sure if pre-buttered buns is a new thing however still disappointed in lack of options."}
{"text":"Jack Astor's (this location) is hands down my favourite rooftop patio in North York. Food is alright, service is alright, price range is similar to restaurants like milestones and sharks. If quality dining experience (food wise) is what you're looking for I wouldn't recommend but definitely for drinks and hanging out with a decent view. 
Location is pretty convenient - near the TTC station and they have street parking available.
P.s. Recommend their Chicken quesadillas, Veggie pizza, the fishbowl cocktails. (Avoid their shrimp pasta - watery, Calamari - a bit greasy)  
Overall, good experience!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed with Jack.  Went here one day and the wait was an hour long and we ended up leaving. After that experience, I was determined to go back. Says something about my personality, doesn't it? Anyways, wish I was not that determined because it sucked. 

The food was just OK. However ,the service was terrible. They asked one person in my party how her burger was and she said that it was not that good and just OK which was an honest response. Things got weird after that. The manager came out and tried to explain that the burger was meant to taste that way. Then the waitress started making some snarky comments like we could complain on their site as well. She stopped paying attention to our table after that and things got really slow. Hey lady, you asked her how the burger was and she gave you an honest opinion. Don't ask the question if you don't want to hear the answer!! 

BOO Jack Astor's, perhaps you are taking your success for granted."}
{"text":"Great nachos! Like the place, the staff is super friendly, I recommend. Why I didn't put a 5 stars is that they don't have a lot of vegetarian choices."}
{"text":"By far the worst location. Food was so gross, service was bad (wasn't even busy). Just do not come to this location, the ones in Mississauga are 10 times better. Music was wack too, playing disco ball music."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to eat it has the best service and best music and amazing food and I always go their with my friends and family!!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 1145 just in time to snag a patio seat. Had to sit in the smoking section, but the wind was in our favour so no smokey smell.

Two of us had the topless steak with salad -- really delicious lunch-size portion. Another guy, our Kosher teammate had the salmon and rice, and really enjoyed it. Last guy had the cheese burger with feta instead of cheddar. Licked the plate clean.

Service was pleasant albeit a bit confusing. I ordered a Guinness and two waiters brought me a pint each. Not a problem though.

Great spot for lunch."}
{"text":"After a Jays game on a near-perfect night, this Jack Astor's is a fun place to be. I had not been here before, but will be back.

1. The food is good. I had a burger that was tasty, but could've had more meat. All of the toppings were fresh.
2. The sides are pretty standard. I had a salad instead of fries, and it was surprisingly green and fresh, as well as better than I expected it to be.
3. There are plenty of TVs playing all major sporting events.
4. They have plenty of indoor and patio seating. At peak times you will wait! There is ample seating here for larger parties.
5. They have a sufficient selection of beers on draught.
6. The service here is a bit better than average, but might be less so on a terribly busy night.

A meal here before or after a Jays game will cost the same as a meal inside the park, yet with better food."}
{"text":"So this girl has a major problem with poutine (french fries)  -problem is she LOVES the wonderful Canadian calorie laden invention.
Fast forward to yesterday in Toronto. I had checked if there was a Jack Astors anywhere near by, there is. 
Went around noon, got right in, YEAH!  
Was there for their Buffalo Chicken version, think there are 3 choices.
Mentioned to my server, cutest guy ever, to please just ensure they are hot, not warm-hot. He agreed and said no problem. Out they came, beautiful....but tepid warm for sure not hot. He'd already dashed off. 
They cool off so fast anyway, especially with the tomatoes and lettuce onion and chicken -
they have to be hot otherwise I'm gaining weight and not enjoying them.   
My darling guy came back after I flagged down a couple of servers 
and he was surprised they weren't hot? Nope, he even touched them.  
Came back out with new 
order, ohhhhhh yummmmm.
Happy girl here, very happy, very content, so pleased. 
Can't eat a whole order so took back to my hotel, put in frig, ate rest later.
Thank you Jack Astors, love love love your poutine!
Hummmm, why \"is\" my uniform tight today?
Smiling here...."}
{"text":"The food is just so BLAND. It's no wonder why they display hundreds of hot sauce jars within the restaurant, because both my sister and I added HEAPS of Tabasco just to add some flavour. I'm not a huge fan of hot sauce to begin with, but I found that my dish (chicken fajita bowl) really needed extra flavour. 

I understand that this is a chain restaurant so my expectations weren't too high, but still I was not expecting a completely flavourless meal. 

I've given Jacks 2 stars instead of 1 because the service was excellent and definitely above standard. Our server was prompt and friendly. HOWEVER, when the hostess sat us to our tables, we couldn't help but notice that she wrote down the time we were seated right on our table (the tables are covered in that brown paper for kids to draw on). This really confused us and made it seem like the servers and cooks must have been on some kind of time rush? This took away from the dine-in experience, since the time stamp made it seem like we were almost at a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"The Jack Astor's above Dundas Square is basically like that Starbucks above the Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo -- I think it's like a requisite for tourists.  I guess you can't blame them - both places overlooked the bright, crowded and busiest area of the area.

Only come here during patio season - the view is pretty cool.  Otherwise, it's like any other mega-bar.

But don't expect anything else - food and drinks... meh.  Service is predictably plastic given this is a mega-chain."}
{"text":"This location is lucky that there aren't many other competing establishments around. I wanted to go to the Keg but this was the closest option at the time so I went with my girlfriend for a \"quick\" bite before heading over to a friends party. Little did I know that when I ordered a bowl (rice, chicken, stir fried veggies) it would take them over an hour to prepare. I am not exaggerating in the slightest. I tried to give the server the benefit of the doubt but it literally took them over an hour to bring out the wrong dish! My girlfriend ordered a burger and when the server brought it over, it was cold. After that, I insisted to speak with the manager because this was turning into a bad joke. Ten minutes later I finally got my stir fry bowl and my girlfriend got a new burger. The manager comped the bill which is what anyone with common sense would do. It wasn't even a busy night so this shouldn't have happened. This place needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"Came as a large group, a birthday party of two bench tables and everyone ordering at separate times, so take this as just my experience. The service was a little iffy, very off and on. The servers are friendly enough, and maybe it was partly my fault for not noticing but some mistakes were made.

I ordered the featured draught, an amber beer and some wings. First off, my drink came later than a bunch of other beers that were ordered by other people 10 mins later. Second,  as I was trying a new beer, I didn't even realize I actually received the wrong drink till I had finished mine and was sampling my friend's whose tasted more like the drink that was described to me. She had suspected something was wrong as well, but just stayed quiet since no one else spoke up. Quite unfortunate.

The wings were a little slow to come, but the presentation was fun, and Korean and medium sauces really hit your nose in a good way. They toss the wings in small pots right in front of you! However the taste itself wasn't great. The wings seemed dry and actual flavours weren't quite to my liking. I'd probably try something else next time."}
{"text":"Out of all the jack Astor's that I've been to this was the most shitty place I've been to and it's all thanks to one waitress. I forgot her name that's how much I didn't care for her, she was nice at first but then she messed up my order by bringing me my appetizer with my entree. Like lets be real, it's an appetizer for a REASON. Who eats appetizer with their meal? Honestly it's the first time I hear that. If she wasn't sure if I wanted it with my meal she could've ASKED but she didn't say anything and it's not my job to tell her because it's common sense that the appetizer must come BEFORE the meal. Nevertheless, after that she proceeds to tell me not to be rude with her when I WASN'T. I was just making a point and told her I don't need the appetizer now that the entree has arrived ALONG with the appetizer. And to top it all off, the rest of the night she didn't come back to my table to ask how everything was. Moral of the story is, if you're wrong just admit it and say sorry and do your job properly. I'll NEVER go back to that Jack Astor's. Shitty service indeed."}
{"text":"I dropped by this location for lunch with some friends. We sat at the bar and our waitress was Kate. She was nice, asked us our names and actually took the time to remember them. I thought she was a good server. I couldn't help but to stare at all the beautiful girls at this location. For all the guys there is plenty of eye candy. I ordered the BBQ holy smoke burger with sweet potato fries. I had this burger before at the Winston Churchill / dundas location. The first time it was amazing. The second time the burger was less than desirable. This third time it was okay quality. The meat was a little over cooked which resulted in a less juicy burger, but everything else was fine. I give this place 3 stars which is average. If the food was consistent I would easily give it a 4 star."}
{"text":"This is a great location. 
There's lots of parking and never any trouble finding a spot. 
Jack Astor's is a great chain and this location is one of my favourite places to eat at when I'm in Scarborough. 
In the summer time I like to sit on the patio. The patio area here is huge ! They have cooling mist during the hot day and heaters in the chilly evenings. 
They have a great drink menu and offer a large variety of summer cocktails. They have a good bar and staff that can make just about anything you ask for. 
The menu has everything - from shareable nachos, to greasy bar food, to steak dinners , or pasta dishes. Whatever you decide to oder there- in my experience- is always made to perfection. 
The price is cheap - $20 is more than enough for one person to eat - unless you go for the steak, in which case $30 would do it (tip not included in prices mentioned). 
The staff is always great- so naturally, i always tip them well. Very friendly and very attentive. 
The bathrooms kinda suck because the stall is small and the door opens towards you (into the stall) making getting out a little awkward. They dont loose a star because they bathroom itself is spacious, renovated, and, fairy clean. 
Overall its a great place to go- been many times over the past few years and I have yet to be disappointed here."}
{"text":"I had an early dinner at this location and was very pleased. The chicken fingers are so tender. I keep ordering the same thing each time because I love it.  My friend also loved her meal.  I was very impressed with the serving staff. Everyone was very kind and helpful. I would visit this location again for sure."}
{"text":"located all over toronto area.. kind of like a sports bar..

food was decent and does the job.. big portions and basically pub food

good place to meet in a big group.. also went one nite to check out UFC"}
{"text":"Wonderful to visit Toronto. Great city! Had a chance to eat at nine restaurants in 5 days. This one by far was the most disappointing and a long characterization is not needed. On a Sunday night, the place was not particularly busy. I ate at the bar. The bartender was very affable. I ordered the Classic NY Sirloin \"rare\". I was explicit about overcooking the steak. It was served medium with just a hint of pink. Among the three beers I drank with dinner was the Erdinger Weissbier. I drink this beer regularly as well as its brethren the Erdinger Dunkel. One sip and it was obvious to me the beer had soured and I immediately ordered a Kronenberg 1664. At the end of the meal, with a full unfinished beer and an untouched steak the bartender asked \"how was dinner?\" I said it wasn't all that great. The Erdinger had soured and the steak was over-done. She said \"good to know\". So let's recap. Two beers, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley - $80. I  definitely, will never go back. There were a number of really good satisfying meals to choose from. This was not one of them."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, but sat near or at the bar to dine. I enjoyed the atmosphere and food. I had the burgers, pizza or honey sesame chicken plate during my visits, to which I enjoyed each. The staff was always friendly and attentive. You can always walk to other places nearby if this place doesn't work for you."}
{"text":"I have been driving by this place for over 2 years and finally went inside last nite for a date nite with the mrs. First impression, damn, this place is huge inside. Great patio. The trees and plants give you some sort of privacy so not every driver on Yonge st knows what you are upto. 
Ordered the sesame garlic wings and bruschetta and a pitcher of sangria. I wasn't expecting much from the wings as my go-to place is st.lois or all stars, but the wings here were awesome. Bruschetta was amazing and fresh. The sangria was perfect. The mixture/combination was perfect. Service was pleasant and courteous. 
Am i going there again you ask.... Hell ya!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, the food is delicious, although the service isn't that amazing. It may have been rush hour and we may have been a big group but we had to ask for our waters to be refilled and there was a mix up on our bills as well."}
{"text":"Service is good but could be better.  Food was great.  I love the chicken parmesan bowties I always get extra cheese on it though.  We go here with friends just to hangout and eat."}
{"text":"Food very very delicious,but very expensive. This plate with coke 29,00 dólares. 
great service. Very cool environment. I recommend"}
{"text":"I came here on a whim and loved how huge it looked inside. The mirror near the bar area gives the illusion of a much bigger space. Props for having it. Ordered the chimichurri steak option and the side fries was delicious. The steak was done about medium when I asked for almost well done but I am fine with it because it wasnt dry and over cooked. So I guess the chef did what was best given the steaks they have. Date ordered the blackened salmon and she loved it. It was sort of infused with some asian influences but it was mostly a solid piece of charred salmon. She loved it. Service was fine. Nothing outstanding but not the worst either. 4 **** stars overall and I would come again. Thanks JA!"}
{"text":"Ordered the wake'n bacon chicken club and an iced tea that came w/ free refills. The chicken club was more club than chicken. I mean the total amount of chicken could've made a nugget and a half. More than half the height of the sandwich was from the lettuce of which there was no small amount. It was more like a lettuce club than a chicken club. IOW, if they'd doubled the amount of chicken, the lettuce would still outweigh it. As for the free refills, our waitress avoided coming over so I couldn't ask for a refill. She was probably ashamed of the so called chicken club sandwich.  

Tl;dr: it's Jack AStorS so of course it's gonna be subpar tourist grade doodoo. Avoid like our waitress avoided refilling our drinks."}
{"text":"Huge portions. A little on the pricey side for basic food. If you upgrade your fries to poutine it's HUGE."}
{"text":"Is anything other than the appetizer menu and salads that is good at Jack Astor's? Beats me why I keep going back. Anyway, I was super hungry after a TIFF movie so I decided to order from the Pasta menu at this place - One really really big meatball. It came, spaghetti writhed in clunky-chunky-sloppy tomato sauce... which for some reason had too much heat to it. If it's going to be spicy... you mention it somewhere in the menu. For people who don't like spice, maybe? When I mentioned it to the waitress, she acted like it wasn't her problem and like I should've known better. The meatball was hard and unappetizing. I make better pasta and meatballs at home. 

My boyfriend enjoyed his meal - Crispy Honey Sesame Chicken. I didn't try it but it really didn't look all that appetizing. I was a hungry, disappointed whiner for the rest of the night. Tried eating the leftover pasta the morning after and it still tasted just as bad. 
 
To be honest, I'll probably end up giving this place another shot sometime ... and it will probably only be because of the excellent location for pub grub."}
{"text":"@Jack_Astors #JACKASTORS #TOFOOD #YELPGTA

What can I say about Jack Astor's? Never too much. However, JA is always an uncomplicated choice for group settings. As far as I know, they allow split bills on groups as large as 10 people. 

This location has 2 floors, and the usual decor. Cocktails were great, as was the sangria apparently (I didn't try the sangria), and JA surprisingly offers a good selection of shots. 

Food was a tad disappointing. I've been to Jack Astor's plenty (sadly) so I am aware of their food portions - especially since I usually always stick to a particular order. My boyfriend wasn't all that hungry and I can never finish a pasta dish at these places - so we ordered a Asiago Chicken Bowties to share. This is something we've done before as well; and they usually bring out the whole dish of pasta and two extra plates for us to help ourselves. This location, however, brought out two separately dressed plates for us, which would have been impressive if the portions weren't severely cut down. *thumbs down*"}
{"text":"Lately, everything I've ordered at any location of Jack Astor's has been spicy. I thought \"steak\" would've been a safe option; it was lovely - small, cooked to perfection, BUT after two bites, spicy and not so pleasant. Next time I go, Caesar Salad, it is. 

Reasons to not go to Jack Astor's?

1. There's always other options around Jack, often better.
 
2. The waitresses really don't ever give a shit about you. Or if you're enjoying your food. I've never met a pleasant one. Although most are pretty darn hot. 

3. For the price you pay, you could get something far better.

4. Loud. Always. 

I should remind myself again and again. For some reason, I keep going back."}
{"text":"It was our first time in the City and I am glad we went there to dine. The burgers were delicious! And the variety is was is awesome because it definitely made me want to go back to try them all. The burgers don't come with fries which really sucks but that's the only problem. It was a little more then it probably should be but the good and service were great so I'd go back. If it wasn't so much I'd probably eat there everyday!"}
{"text":"Came here for a work Christmas lunch just before the holidays. I've been to Jack Astor's quite a few times in the Toronto locations before, but this is the first time I came to the Whitby location. I initally had trouble finding the entrance. After I parked I realized that the entrance is facing inside the pathway (they have a section that allows pedestrians to walk around \"like a plaza\" so all the entrances of restaurants were facing inwards in that sense.

Staff are very nice, friendly. It was busy, so sometimes service was a bit slow. I ordered the sangria - quite a delightful drink! It comes with extra juice and wine on the side so you can adjust the sangria as you wish. However, for 12 bucks, it's a bit more pricey than sangria in other places. 

I ordered the garlic pan bread. Still as good as I remembered it :) Tho this time I found the bread just a bit on the drier side. I was expecting it to be more moist.
Next I ordered what I always order, which was the chicken fingers and fries. Chicken fingers did not disappoint either, they were still just as good, though next time i might add the extra sauce!'
I love their chicken fingers because they do their own breading. Therefore when I eat it, the crust just falls apart softly, giving it that lovely crispy yet juicy texture that I love about chicken tenders :) The only compliant is that I kind of wish the portions are bigger... When I\"m paying 13/14 bucks for chicken fingers, I expect there to be more than 4 (see picture).

My friend ordered the crispy quinoa chicken slaw. She said she really liked the slaw. In fact I was quite surprised how much greens was provided. I would've actually really liked that with chicken fingers :)

Overall the food is pretty good and i love their chicken fingers, but at the price and quantity, I won't be coming here regularly just to get them."}
{"text":"My cousins took me here for the first time while visiting Toronto. I liked the atmosphere, casual & upbeat, kind of reminded me of Red Robins back at home. We first sat outside in the patio because it was a nice area, I loved how it was overlooking the city. But once we sat down we realized how hot & humid it was so we went back inside and the hosts were quick to find us a new table.

Nachos were good, a pretty large serving and they gave us 4 different dipping sauces which I liked. Buuut this location gets 2 stars from me because of our server. He was training another gentleman and wasn't doing any of the work, the trainee was obviously the one putting in our order, serving our food, etc. 

Once we were all finished (there was 6 of us) and gave the trainer server our finalized bills he said \"you know I do this for a living, right?\" --hold up.
1. All of us tipped 15% or more. You're lucky we even tipped at all!
2. You didn't even do the work. Your trainee did.
3. You should probably get a different job if this kind of thing gets to ya. Server life isn't for you.

I believe his name was John D. but I'm not quite sure...that may be the trainee's name. If it is, then my mistake, the trainee was great to us. I work in a restaurant myself and saying a remark such as that is just so unprofessional. Completely changed our experience, I wouldn't come back to this location."}
{"text":"I love coming here and I've never had a bad experience at this location. The outdoor seating is not as nice as other locations but usually eat inside anyways.

I go here for the burgers really. They have a vegetarian burger that is great, sometimes I order that even though I'm not vegetarian but usually I get beef. I would avoid getting the gluten free bun though, that is a disaster.

Nice environment, a bit loud but fun on a weekend."}
{"text":"Very short visit. Walked in at 5:38, walked out at 5:52..no server came to our table with many walking about attending to other tables. Very disappointed. Was excited about having dinner here but mood was completely ruined. Not recommended.."}
{"text":"Went here with family as the place is around the corner from where I am staying for the next two weeks.

The place has a nice ambiance.

I liked the service.

I thoughts the prices were high for a family bar/restaurant and the food was just average. The nachos were the best choice, but we also had the garlic cheese breads and lobster/crab dip for appetizers. We were a party of 6 and we all had sandwiches, except for the fish and chips.

The portions are very generous.

I'll come back and will try other items."}
{"text":"I recently went to Jack Astor's with a large group, and it was my first experience. My colleagues described it as a Canadian TGI Friday's. But I'll have to say that my experience far exceeded TGI. First of all, the place is more trendy and upscale than TGI Friday. Secondly, the service here was amazing. The attractive and enthusiastic servers were responsive, never responded to our many requests with a \"no\" or a sneer, they were fun, and my food and drink came promptly. 

I enjoyed the calamari, which was standard but tasted fresh and was served in a large portion. I had the chicken and shrimp fajitas -- which was an accommodation to my request for both -- and they were delicious. I loved the spice or marinade that they used. 

While Jack Astor's is not going to win a James Beard Award for wine or innovative cuisine, the food is right on point, the price is reasonable, and the service is excellent. And the experience was fun. Nicely done."}
{"text":"Food was great, i gave a 5 stars because the manager came to our table and told my friend that they are out of the dessert she wanted, so my friend ordered a latte, the restaurant actually didn't make any but the manager went above and beyond to buy it from the coffee shop next door. That is amazing customer service!
I had the fried cheesecake, must try!"}
{"text":"I have been to this Jack Astor's many times because it is our office favourite.  This speaks volume about the consistent quality yet predictable food Jack Astor's serves.  There is quite a bit of variety, ranging from burgers and sandwich to Thai rolls.  The waiters are usually enthusiastic.  They will split bills without complaint.   

One should note that, though they present you with a lunch menu, the items on the lunch menu are all from the regular menu without price discount.  There are many choices in the regular menu that are less expensive than the ones on the lunch menu.  Thus, please don't feel that you are getting a deal by ordering from the lunch menu, nor feel that the regular items are all more expensive."}
{"text":"Our favorite stop off the island.  Best on Friday or Saturday night when things are hopping and the staff and kitchen keep things fresh and moving. Great spirit, perfect garlic pan, rest of food is good and pretty straight forward. You will never find the free wifi they promise, but the menu is big and varied and you can get a bit of a line on some nights. Hopping bar, hockey is always on."}
{"text":"I would stop here for a beer, and a pub snack but not dinner.

I had:

Sangria 
California Grilled Chicken Salad 
Sweet Potato Fries

The Sangria wasn't too good, it tasted more like juice. The salad was great but had WAY too much dressing, I had to stop eating it because it was just too much, I should have asked for it on the side. Sweet potato fries are always awesome :)

I wouldn't choose to go back for dinner over the other great restaurants in Toronto"}
{"text":"We go semi-regularly - maybe every couple of months. It's not fancy, not ridiculously expensive, and they take reservations on weekends, which is a nice touch.  The food is reliable, and the service is generally very good.

I just wish they could train their servers to know which table is which - I almost always get one stopping by to ask if we've ordered something, only to find out it was the next table over, or occasionally not even near ours.  We once had them bring us an appetizer for someone else while we were eating dessert. 

The free \"world's best dad\" glass for Father's Day was a nice touch - thank you!"}
{"text":"Jack Astor's. What can I say? When I go to Jack Astor's, I expect to get exactly what I receive. It isn't fine dining, but as chains go, it's consistent and always decent. Came here feeling pretty inebriated (that's usually how I LEAVE) and needed some food to soak up that pesky booze.

First time at this particular location. Service was acceptable and servers were friendly.  We got the chicken parmigiana with asiago bowties, a long-standing fave, as well as the honey-garlic wings. Both my friend and I commented today, two days later, that we're still craving those wings. Crispy and delicious, they were. I was dousing mine in Tabasco as I went. So delish. Not much else to say on that!"}
{"text":"Worst service, worst food. Overpriced nachos with nothing on them, $1 for 3 jalapeños chopped up in little pieces. When bringing this concern up to the staff they just said \"thanks for letting me know\" 
Go to shark bar one level down instead."}
{"text":"Came here on a cold Friday night after visiting the Distillery District Christmas Market. We came in a group of 7 at 8pm and we were seated fairly quickly within 10 minutes of wait. The place was pretty packed at the time so I was quite delighted that we got to sit down this quickly.

Since I had already eaten at the Christmas Market I wasn't feeling too hungry, so I only ordered the regular poutine, which was around $7. The portion was huge and could easily be a meal if you're feeling hungry. Taste wise it was ok, nothing too spetacular, but it's the perfect hearty meal on a cold day. 

The ambiance of the restaurant was great, it felted really warm and cozy to be inside to hangout and chat. They have tons of TVs around for anyone interested in following sports as well. I really like this TV wall that has many different sizes of TV playing a wide range of channels."}
{"text":"Great vibe and quick service!

My buddy and myself went here to grab a late night appetizer. Plenty of room at the dinner section but the bar was pack!

I can't really comment much on the food, since it was just nachos that we got. But it's a bonus that it wasn't bad either. I would come back here again and hopefully the service stays just as good."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times, but first time reviewing the food. I was expecting a 5 star since I had never had a bad experience. This time was not that great, it was a late night poutine and calamari.

Let's start with the poutine, I remember it being amazing and drench with gravy. This time around it was mediocre. It was a tea spoon of gravy and not very good cheese curds. I would've been better off with a basket of fries with gravy on the side. Please readers don't waste your time ordering this fake poutine.

Second is the calamari, it was alright. I feel like it was store bought, but bonus points on the sauce. Without the sauce, it would've been another mediocre meal.

What made this place a must return joint is the music and entertainment tv. It was amazing and kept the mood happy which hid all the deficiency of the food.

Next time I come back, I'll stick with the burger and fries and pasta meals. 3 star since I've had good experiences before. Please Jacks, step up your game."}
{"text":"Went her twice. Once for a double date and once for a date a few months ago.. Anyways, for the first time it was crowded and I thought that's why the service was SOOOOO SLOW. It was my first time eating at Jack Astor's and the other couple that was accompanying is had informed me that Jack Astor's takes a long time to bring your food. So we sat there for almost 30 minutes til we got our food. I wouldn't say it was worth the wait... I mean the food wasn't terrible, and I had no complaints about it...but the food wasn't special or anything. I could've left, went to 5 guys and got my meal 5x quicker than Jack Astor's. 
The second time...same issue and I was more upset because it was not even busy and me and my date even mentioned that service takes a while. 
I would recommend another place as a \"date\" place...this seems more of a \"I'll have drinks here instead\"."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend today might have been the great company, was a awesome lunch.
Had the Smiling Buddha, it was just perfect.  Waitress was funny and friendly and the weather was good on the patio... just a great time."}
{"text":"It was a friends 15 year old daughters birthday and we were getting together to celebrate this milestone, so we allowed her to select the restaurant for us to take her to. Most kids would pick a South Street Burger, 5 Guys, or even a Swiss Chalet...she wanted to go here because, according to her, the food is amazing. Regardless, it was her choice. I had been to Jack Astor's in the past (the one in Vaughan) and wasn't all that impressed, but that was a while ago so I went with an open mind.

Anyways, we were seated as soon as we arrived. Restaurant has a nice atmosphere and it was not that busy (it was Easter Monday).

Our server, Josh, was at our table shortly after we arrived and took our drink order and returned shortly thereafter to take our food order. He made the visit memorable. He was funny, attentive, engaging and helped steer us through their menu. He recommended Pad Thai, stating it was one of the best he's ever had...so I went with his recommendation and he was bang on...it was excellent. Kudos for knowing your menu so well. He also brought out a brownie at the end of our meal to acknowledge the 15 year olds birthday....then lit a \"sparkler\" saying that every girl should have some fun on her birthday. He made her day with that small gesture/comment and made fans of the adults. 

Besides my Pad Thai (which was excellent), the 15 year old ordered a Deluxe Burger with fries, which she loved. My other 2 dining companions each ordered the Steak Sandwich. While both said the steak was cooked as ordered and was delicious, it was an open faced sandwich, which they weren't expecting. However, this did not prevent them eating everything on their plates. If it wouldn't have been too embarrassing, I'm positive they would have licked their plates as well.

All in all, the food was excellent, atmosphere good, service spectacular (thanks again to Josh).

It's interesting, I would have most likely not visited this restaurant based on some of the negative reviews, but glad that I did before reading them.

I WILL revisit this location again."}
{"text":"I always recommend the beer & cheddar soup as it is simply superb. This time I was surprised by a new drink recommended by our waitress, yet the name escapes me. I remember that it is named after an old customer.

If you can, sit out on the patio overlooking Yonge-Dundas Square. Even in the fall, you can stay nice & toasty with a light sweater on as they have lantern heaters near every table,

Service was just okay & it was quite distracting to see the waitress either shivering in the cold because of their short black skirts & tank tops barely covering anything or watching the waitresses constantly trying to pull down their skirts that were riding quite far up their behinds. Considering the chilly weather, you would think management would at least now let them wear pants. At least the male bartender outside would periodically rub their arms & backs to try to warm them up, I suppose...."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5
Service: 4/5
Location: 4/5

It's always a safe bet with Jack Astor's.

I've been to this location time after time for lunches with friends and after-work snacks/drinks and it's usually a good experience. The servers are friendly (and good looking!), and the food is consistently tasty. I like that they're always changing up their menus, so you never have to get too bored with the menu. 

Their lunch specials are also very affordable. The other day I ordered a soup and salad for just $11 and it was more than enough for a filling lunch. The soup of the day was tequila chicken!? I won't question anything with tequila in it. I'm a sucker for Caesar salad, so of course I got that as a side. The garlic bread that comes with is flavourful, but literally SOAKING in oil and butter. It's up to you to weigh the trade-off between deliciousness and heart disease. I don't think I'll disclose what my choice was. 

I like this Jack Astor's location a lot! It's close to Union station and super convenient."}
{"text":"I like that their fries get their own spices. The fact that they can actually serve anything from Pad Thai to Pizza on their menu is a good representation of their kitchen's flexibility. They have a great chicken pizza and a delicious smoked onion burger and even a beer and cheese soup :) I certainly like their server attitudes and looooove the whole brown-paper-draw-on-your-table concept. The decoration also serves to entertain."}
{"text":"This is just standard corporate Jack Astor patio for Jack Astors patrons.  This area was recently gentrification . It has really changed for the better.  
There are high stores here and movie theatres  close if you feel like shopping and catching a movie. The movie theatre is not for kids under 19 because the theatre caters to adults . Ie  - regular bar for night life entertainment."}
{"text":"One of the worst experience I have ever had in any restaurant in Canada. I went there to spend some quality time with family after having a very busy day in office. I was served everything altogether including starters, dinners and drinks in spite of telling them let me have starters and drink first. I was told that kitchen was fast enough to get everything cooked altogether. After the escalation to manager. They took dinner back and promised to serve it fresh when I want. However, they kept me waiting for the dinner and never served even after reminding the server. Finally, we asked her to pack the dinner and get us check. This was my biggest mistake to go there when I had an option of Montana's or Moxie's in the same location."}
{"text":"This downtown local keeps its \"around the corner\" feel instead of getting caught up in the hustle and bustle of the big city. Friendly service and a huge bar are great for hanging out with friends, or meetups before and after just about any Toronto game.
My favourite aspect of Jack Astor's is the drinks. The food is OK, but their drinks out-do themselves. When I finally realized that the place brews and bottles their own rootbeer I was hooked. Deliciously smooth and much better than A & W, I truly appreciated the option of a brewed non-alcholic beverage for the sober vegetarian in me."}
{"text":"This is my go to bar. They have great finger food and a sick patio. This location is usually very busy but the service is fast and I never had to wait longer than 10-15 mins on their busiest nights. Here is a picture of their nachos. They do not cheap out on the toppings! I also like their cheese burger, broccoli bites and 5 cheese chicken (mac and cheese). And absolutely love their sangria!"}
{"text":"Been here many times but didn't Yelp. Awesome place for lunch or dinner. The burgers at lunch are filling and prepared perfectly. Staff always quick and attentive. Wifi makes it a great place for a working lunch."}
{"text":"Typical sit-down burger joint. Not the greatest, i've had, nor worth the price. McDonalds beats them really well. Service is really crummy, waiters don't seem to care much about clients sitting down."}
{"text":"No, No, NO! I could not be more disappointed with this restaurant. It is very unforgivable to let hungry people wait to be served. We arrived at the restaurant, and we immediately seated to a table. The restaurant was dark that I used my cellphone light to read the menu. Noise level is extremely loud to the point where my eye were pulsating. It wasn't even game night, nor was the volume coming from the 100's of TVs. The music was way to loud. 

After selecting our meal from the menu, we waited, and waited and of course waited and additional 22 minutes, and no waiter came to take our order. That we actually stood up and walked out, and went to the restaurant across from this one in the mall. Horrible service, and when one is starving to eat, patience isn't good. 22 minutes and still no service ain't acceptable. I will NEVER return here again."}
{"text":"My waiter was pretty good in comparison to the other ones I had from the other Jack Astor's locations.  

I had the asiago chicken bowties while my bf had the chicken parmigiana.  My portion was slightly smaller than usual but his was slightly larger (coincidence?) but was still good. 

We split a chocolate trifle, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Food takes awhile as usual, was good but not anything special"}
{"text":"This is my favorite hangout place to chill with my friends during my time off. Order some appetizers ; bruschettas, garlic fries and have couple of drinks. The waiters are friendly and the music is good too."}
{"text":"Visit while on vacation in Toronto, this place is a very busy bar/restaurant, your typical sports bar with with many TV\"s and bar food. I found the food to be non memorable, not awful just not great. The place does have an excellent view of downtown Toronto given that it is located on the 3rd floor of the building."}
{"text":"Had no complaints about my steak, but I loved the Crispy Sesame Chicken (which was not mine, lol). I enjoyed my summer sangria, the atmosphere (we ate on the patio) n the service (she smiled n joked all night). -up, n I recommend this location to every1"}
{"text":"Fun times for all.

The food and drinks at Jack Astor's are mighty dependable. Try the rigatoni or the bowtie pasta! AND their garlic pan bread.... heart attack inducing buttery goodness...

I'm a fan of the posters specifically in this Jack Astor's. Funny stuff. The music they spin isn't too shabby either.

Service was a little scattered the night my coworkers and I came to this Jack Astor's location, but all-in-all, we're probably coming back this week."}
{"text":"In and out for lunch in a half-hour! 

Either I was really hungry or they were astonishingly fast! ...It's probably both.

I came in around 11:45... just in time to hear the end of their shift meeting. It ended with a cheer! Love that team spirit. Gooooooooo Jack! Goooooo super-yummy-hot-out-of-the-oven-buttery-garlicky-pan-bread!"}
{"text":"We came here for team lunch.  The server was polite and serve us very quickly.  I ordered the bacon and chicken club.  It is very fresh and cook to perfection.  The atmosphere is great with lots of TV to watch sport event.  This place is worth coming to check out."}
{"text":"Note: this location has 2 yelp profiles.  

Really?  This place is a fucking JOKE.  It's some sort of weird hybrid of Hooters, TGI Fridays, and a lame dance club.  After arriving from DC, my friends and I were starved.  We walked to the closest mall and noticed Jack Astor's patio from the street.  We head into the mall only to find a line out front, complete with rope and some skank bouncer with a clipboard.  We bipass the line and the ditz with the clipboard and enter the restaurant to ask the hostess what the wait will be.  There were 3 hostesses (yup, 3!) standing around arguing about seating.  One tells us the wait is 15 minutes.  We are then scolded by the clipboard Nazi and told to go back outside to wait in line.  After about 10 minutes of more arguments between the hostesses and the line Nazi, ANOTHER hostess starts walking us to our table.  When she sees that our table is taken, she is dumbfounded.  She then scurries away, leaving us stranded in the middle of the restuarant.  She eventually comes back and laughs at us for not following her.  WTF.  She then sits us at a bar table and hands us a menu full of over-priced food.  We wait.  And wait.  And wait.  While listening to the deafening club music, we look around and notice that no one else is being served either.  I see empty glasses, empty plates, and some tables, like ours, that have clearly not been served yet.  Just as I'm about ready to complain, 2 servers start walking our way.  Yay, someone is finally going to take our order!  NOPE.  Both of them circumvent our table to tag-team the table next to us (and those patrons were seated AFTER we were).  That's it!  We get up and leave.  And guess what?!  No one even noticed.  
 
I have 2 words for the idiotic, rude, scantily-clad 21-year-old employees AND the douche-waffle manager who hired them:  Fuck.  You."}
{"text":"Even though I live fairly close to Jack Astor's, I don't frequent it too often as it's your typical chain restaurant with boring menu items. I went there a few weeks ago with some friends from work because the wait at Joey Sherway was close to 90 minutes. We were seated in a really loud section of the dining area. My colleagues ordered their drinks ahead of me because I was talking to one of my neighbours who I saw at the bar. I must have waited close to 30 minutes for my margarita to finally arrive; however, aside from the company, it was the best part of the visit. Two of us ordered burgers and fries, while the other two ordered fish and chips. Burger was just OK and fries were cold. One colleague had to send back the fish as it was only half cooked. Waitress was very, very annoying and there were small flies buzzing around the tables. Unless outnumbered, I'd pass on returning."}
{"text":"We had lunch here a few weeks ago to celebrate a colleague's birthday. About four of us ordered the chicken tenders and Caesar salad. The salad had no dressing and they added capers for some weird reason. The chicken tenders were soggy and pretty much uneatable. Also, the fountain pops were flat. I ended up spending over $30 for a gross lunch. Never again."}
{"text":"Nouveau restaurant du Centropolis à Laval. GRAND, Bar/Grill/Pub faisant parti de la chaîne des Jack Astor's et semblable aux autres restaurants du genre, donc restaurant sans cachet particulier. Je ne leur en tiendrai pas préjudice car on le sait avant d'y entrer, les cadres sont mignons par contre. Nous y sommes allés en famille (6) un dimanche après-midi vers 14:15 pour un anniversaire. Un petit dîner en famille. Heure idéale avec un bébé de 6 mois et une fillettte de 4 ans le restaurant était quasiment vide. Les vendredi-samedi et dimanche soirs, le restaurant est plein et très bruyant, avec de petits enfants pas idéal. A notre arrivée, notre serveuse était bien, rien d'extraordinaire. Toutefois le boss-boy avec qui elle faisait équipe était très attentionné. On commande les cocktails et les entrées. Ces dernières sont IMMENSES, à partager à 2, 3 ou même 4. Nous avons commandé les nachos et la trempette de homard et crabe. Elles étaient délicieuses et bien suffisantes pour toute la grande famille. La trempette de homard et crabe, bien que très bonne, goûtait davantage le fromage que le homard et le crabe. Nous commandons ensuite les plats principaux... les problèmes commencent... l'arrivée des plats est trèèèèèès longue. Sur 6 plats 5 étaient FROIDS. Ils ont été retournés. Une autre longue attente. Quand le boss boy arrive finalement avec mon plat (Hamburger Jack), alors qu'il est toujours à mes côtés et me demande si tout est correct, je soulève un long cheveu blond sur mon pain. Il prend rapidement l'assiette et se confond en excuses. Il revient nous voir pour s'excuser de plus belle et pour nous aviser que la gérante viendra nous voir. Dans tout celà, JAMAIS la serveuse ne s'est excusé des inconvénients, malgré qu'elle rodait autour de notre table. La gérante vient nous voir pour s'excuser et pour nous offrir, au frais de la maison, les plats qui ont été servis froid. Nous attendons toujours 2 plats.... Finalement on les reçcoit. Mon hamburger Jack (bacon fumé, ognions croustillants, fromage) est superbe et les frites.. chaudes... sont très bonnes. Le boss-boy est revenu nous voir, il a pris le temps de nous parler. Nous sommes sortis du resto à 17:30, tout çà à cause de l'attente. En général, la boufe était bonne. À cause du service du bossboy et de la gérante, je leur donnerais une autre chance. Comme le proverbe le dit, \"Une fois n'est pas coutume\"... mais ne recommencez pas..."}
{"text":"Went there and had the salmon and it wasn't even cooked!! Won't be back here ever again."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Food came out wrong  and took forever to get drinks.Will not be back here."}
{"text":"This was the first place I went in toronto for comfort food and I still enjoy it!! the garlic cheese bread is toothsome. I always order that when i go there. The drinks arent that expensive and the hosts are very friendly. The ambience is fun and buzzing.. the food is good. the drinks are affordable what more would you want from a place that even has a patio facing dundas square.. pitchers of beer are the go to choice here. definitely worth a try and I am a fan of this place"}
{"text":"I always have a great time at Jacks! I'm sad to see that they charge so much for sangria (which is my absolute FAV beverage) but ill hit up Symposium on third and upper middle for those patio nights.
We went for my brothers 21st family birthday dinner- ordered nachos to start- they were great and all the toppings were fresh. My mom and I shared a 'side' Cesar salad, really happy to see the portion size was reasonable and the bacon bits were REAL BACON!! 
The table ordered chicken bowties (fresh, great chicken), a cheeseburger (beautiful presentation and perfectly done), wings (great also), the pulled pork poutine (unreal even with mayo in it), and BLT poutine (not much chicken in it). 
Our server was awesome, she was on too of drink refills and cutlery, even brought us a pitcher of water cuz we were a thirsty bunch! And because it was my brother's birthday they brought him brownies and a sparkler for free."}
{"text":"Let's talk about the service.  My friend and I came here for lunch on Tuesday.  There were a lot of empty tables when we dined in.  We thought we were going to have a good experience dining in since the waitress was constantly checking up on us to see if we were ready to order.  

We ordered the classic sirloin, Asiago chicken bow tie, and grilled chicken quesadilla.  The waitress informed us that we were going to get the quesadilla first (since it was our starter).  The server came and brought us our mains.  We questioned where our starter was.  Not sure if they forgot about it, but the server brought our grilled chicken quesadilla a few minutes later.  

Half way through our entree, the waitress gives us our bill and the dessert menu.  One of the reasons why I come to Jack Astors is to have their delicious sundae.  Since our bill was already totalled, my friend and I decided not to get any dessert since it was too much of a hassle.  We felt rushed devouring our food and did not enjoy it as much as we wanted.  We didn't understand why we were given our bill while we were still eating.  We assumed that the waitress was leaving and wanted to check out.  However, that was not the case.  After we finished our entree, the waitress was still serving other customers.  They need to work on their customer service.  Will I come back? Maybe, maybe not.  But will definitely not come back to this location."}
{"text":"The portions were fair the prices were OK. This location is great for being in the center of everything.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, they have brought in the PERFECT burger bun, which wraps the burger perfectly, but is not so \"bready\" as most other chains. Sure, beers are expensive, the decor is what it is, it's always busy and loud but, besides my love of their burgers (great chicken fingers too), I noticed last Saturday that they now serve Starbucks as their house coffee! This is fantastic. In the chain restaurant business myself, I have begged and begged for good coffee but we stick with a weak, nothing special brew. But Starbucks as the house brew? Will go back for that reason alone. Sure, I usually grab a beer but when I'm in the mood for a coffee as well, I never know where to go."}
{"text":"Eat at Jack Astor's a few weeks ago, Had the burger and sweet potato Fries.
Was really impressed with the staff, super friendly staff and most of all very child friendly. We have a 12 month and a 3 year old. Our 3 year old was kept busy by drawing on their papers they have setup on the tables. Food was excellent and just easy going .staff and very helpful.
Highly recommend them. They have a Elvis booth, not really sure what this is but will try it out next time."}
{"text":"Like their Fish & Chips / Pasta / Bruschetta
And when it comes to the drinks Beached and LIIT are lit. Though there is a lot of ice which you expect at most of the bars - it's a good place to hangout with officemates during day time and dinners 
Late nights with friends especially when you got a Blue Jays game"}
{"text":"Okay so basically depending on the busy-ness of this place, is the quality of service you will get. 

I usually always come here on the weekends which usually means this place is always packed. FYI This location is near square one which is basically downtown Mississauga.

The food here is usually good, but the service is either a hit or miss. The few times I'v been coming here the service has been wishy-washy. If I didn't have a heart, I wouldn't even have left a tip, but I can't really do that. But honestly, Not enough servers on a busy weekend? Really? If they fixed this, the service would most likely be better. 

Anywho, what I do recommend is The Feta Bruschetta, The bow tie pasta, the chicken BLT poutine and the drinks. Oh and I swear by The Cheesecake they have here, So try the cheesecake! If your coming here for the food, okay. If your coming looking for Good service, don't bother.

 I'll most likely keep coming back for the food, and because i'm always usually around the area. Meaning...next time hopefully I'll get better service. 

*fingers crossed*"}
{"text":"I always go the the location by square one, but this time I came here and let me tell you what a big difference. Here you get real customer service. And it doesn't get so busy here, so there's plenty of room for seating, unlike other locations *ahem* 

Basically it's your typical Jack Astor's with really nice servers who check up on you on the regular. In the summer, it's nice to come here in the Summer because you can sit outside in the patio and they have such nice flowers, and nice scenery. Although its still nice to sit inside. Usually when I come here I get either get A Caesar salad, with barbecue chicken wings. Or when the mood strikes, BLT chicken poutine!"}
{"text":"Thursday night w/ my co-workers, we find ourselves at Jack's STC for some grub and drinks.  It's our pay day, oh yea and it's close by to our office!

2 of us arrive at 5PM and it's pretty much empty.  Dimly lit and the light shines through the windows.  We wait til all of us to arrive to do the big order.  A nameless waitress was waiting our table but passed us over because no one arrived yet.  Chevon C took over and she was an excellent waitress.  She was very attentive to our table, kind and had a great personality.

Looking at the menu, I noticed it was re-vamped and updated.  My usual \"Big Meatball Spaghetti\" was missing!  I asked Chevon if they still served it and she replied, \"It's gone because no one ordered it.\"  AH!  I was kind of disappointed but oh well!  I ordered Chicken Fingers with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and the Cheesy Pan Bread with a side of Horseradish. Chevon told me that they do not really carry horseradish in the kitchen but she would check the back for me.

The food came out in a jiffy.  The pan bread was first and yummy as hell.  The main dish came with BBQ and Plum sauce.  Chicken fingers were moist, tender and crunchy.  Great!  The garlic mashed potatoes were done differently.  It had olive oil and in the middle, chopped fresh garlic.  It was decent.  Chevon found me a small cup of horseradish and it was hella strong.  I was almost coughing but enjoyed every minute of it.  It was splendid!  Meal was perfect for the night.

Chevon waited on our table for hours and she packed up my food willingly.  She was glad to help at any time and went out of her way to even fill my water.  By this time, all tables were filled and it was loud and crowded.

Excellent customer service on her part and will most definitely return to the restaurant.  Hopefully she will be our waitress next time."}
{"text":"I used to avoid going to this location due to a prior experience but the food has gotten better. The gf and I sat in the patio on the first nice day of spring and to our surprise they had some new menu items that they were testing. These items were exclusive to this location so we decided to try the asian nachos and korean chicken tenders with perogie fries. The nachos were good as crispy wonton chips were used and the chicken tenders had a nice crunch to them as well. The perogie fries tasted great but can get fairly heavy. My only issue is that I found the sauces used in both dishes to be a little too sweet and that coupled with the chicken wings (which were sauced table side) my gf ordered made it difficult to finish. Our server was very attentive and always checked up on us. Overall, not a bad meal for a chain."}
{"text":"Jack Astor's is a typical sports bar. In Canada, that's pretty typical - and pretty important. It's a very popular spot for locals who come, especially, for the beer cheese soup. Of course I had to try it! It was very good and comes served a shot glass of beer. But, just put it aside, our server told me, it's not real beer. Hmmm. That would've been far more fun for me if it was!
The rest of my meal was okay. I ordered the fish & chips and it was a huge portion - more than I could eat. But really heavy on the breading. My recommendation? Stay with the beer soup and order a burger and a brewskie here. You won't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Can I just say how SLOW the service in this restaurant. I came here twice and both times I left  disappointed. 

The first time I came was at night and the place was jammed packed. Although the ambiance was lively and fun the service was just terrible. It took forever to get the menu, the drinks and finally the food. And by forever I mean; waiting alone took at least 45 mins. 

Seeing that the first time was during the weekend at night; I've decided to give it another shot. The second time I went was on a Wednesday in the afternoon around 1pm. It seemed pretty quiet and there was not much people. To my surprise, our food took so long (40 mins) that we asked the waitress to take it to go because we did not want to eat there anymore. 

Wait time is too long that I will not come back."}
{"text":"I came to this Jack Astor's with a large group (~20 of us total) to celebrate our good friend's birthday. Our reservation was made for 7PM on a Wednesday evening, but by the time all of us finally got there - it was probably around 7:30/7:45 when we were ordering food. Kudos to the wait staff (2 servers total to cover all 20 of us) for their patience. I know that as a large group, we can honestly be really slow at ordering and deciding.

In any case, the restaurant seems to be relatively new. I actually missed it the first time we drove by, only because the signage isn't apparent and doesn't stand out until you are right in front of it. I think I am used to the black/charcoal brick motif that I've seen at other Jack Astor locations. We found street parking on a side street and proceeded to enter the restaurant and be shown to our group's table located on the 2nd floor. A rather large venue I must say - lots of seating available.

For our meals - I ordered the Asiago Chicken Bowties; I wasn't particularly hungry and thus didn't go for a steak or a burger. The food was good - nothing to rave about though, it is what I expected based on the description.

Generally - I thought that the service was good, the food was OK, and the menus were illegible. The reason I say that, is that they have developed the menus as inserts into this plastic sleeve. The issue, is that the sleeve has a slight opacity and isn't completely clear. Thus the menu is VERY HARD TO READ unless you press the plastic directly against the insert and look very carefully.

I'm sure the concept of using the sleeves makes it easy to swap menus out and such - but really, it was straining on the eyes."}
{"text":"Yesterday, after work. I went to jack Astor with my co-works. Ordered the beer. There was a fly in it.
Told and showed her. She didn't say sorry. Instead she made a weird facial reaction. It was like, \" why can't u guys just scooped out the fly and drink it\"... 
worst awkward moment in my life.... anyways they scooped it out and served us with the same drink. Didn't want to make any trouble and we just drank it. I don't think we will go to that place again. Waiter didn't even smile. It was like talking to AI robot. And sadly food was taste soso....  not to sure why people go there  is it b/c of patio ? Maybe ... not sure."}
{"text":"Worst meal I've ever had at Jack Astors!!!! So disappointed! Came here on 9/14/16 at5:15 for dinner. Beer flat and warm. Veggies that came with our wings old and soggy.  Quinoa puffed chicken salad was absolutely disgusting. No dressing and soggy. Looks like they were serving us old food from the lunch run. We used to be JA regulars and have never been so disappointed. This chain is going downhill :( 

My advice to you...go across the street to Joey's or the Keg."}
{"text":"J'aime beaucoup le Jack Astor, bien que je trouve parfois les prix trop élevés. Les pâtes en boucles avec poulet sont vraiment délicieuses, je vous les conseille!

Le restaurant est super grand, donc normalement, tu as de la place assez facilement! Sinon, ils ont des nappes pour dessiner dessus, parfait pour les enfants impatients et les adultes créatifs ;) !"}
{"text":"This place is always hit and miss but decent for the kids meals. The floor below our table was covered in food, toys and old menus on this visit and our table and the one beside had no cutlery. The lady beside us was using her plastic toy from her drink to hold her steak while she cut it. Service was mediocre at best with their new menu. Wholly price increases on the new menu, good thing that basically every other meal is free here because the kitchen and service are always so inconsistent.

They missed items in our order the server never returned after asking our drink order, 7 tables were left un-bussed, food was cold when delivered etc etc. this was their last chance, especially after the manager came over and was completely unresponsive to our complaints. There is a reason this is the Jacks in western Canada."}
{"text":"Went there the other day with my boyfriend! Restaurant is huge and well spaced out. I didn't feel isolated! 
Friendly welcoming staff. 
I had a BBQ burger with the new poutine with smoked meat! Very delicious.  Wait time for food was a little long. 
But the overall experience was enjoyable"}
{"text":"I am most lamentably and embarrassingly remiss in updating my previous review of this restaurant. I had a not very memorable experience with bad nachos, as they were stale, bland, jalapeno free ( I thought they were green bell peppers!) and also lacking in cheese and flavor.

As an avid lover of spicy food, I am very pleasantly surprised to say nachos don't have to be fiery and spicy to be tasty! When I let the restaurant know about my grievances at having taken a dear friend from out of province to dine there on a Friday night two weeks ago, JoJo one of the managers was very apologetic and immediately wanted to remedy the situation.

We all make mistakes but these people do everything they can to ensure it's nothing more than a fleeting memory of the past, and do everything they can to make it right again.

JoJo allowed the same friend, my husband to join me for lunch there on Sunday immediately following the incident and fed us not only delectable chicken quesadilla and the oh-so-worth the calories, totally scrumptious trademark Jack Astor garlic cheese pan bread, which is famous for a reason, but he insisted I try the nachos again this time with fresh tortilla chips and enough cheese to open up its own factory! Yes they use fresh jalapenos which are not a spicy as the jarred variety but it didn't matter because the flavor and care in the preparation made these rival and surpassed The Keg which was my previous contender for best nachos. Excellent service, fair pricing and amazing staff. Definitely would recommend going here. 5/5."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is up to par to similar restaurants but it seemed a bit pricier to me. My friend and I shared the quesadillas which were delicious! I wish they had them as a meal of their own. We seriously contemplated ordering a second plate of them. I ordered the quesadillas with guacamole. The extra charge seemed overpriced to me but frankly I'm glad I ordered it anyway. 

The rest of our meal was more average. My friend's poutine, while very good, was nothing spectacular. My blackened chicken was very good too but overall the burger was a bit on the boring side. 

The atmosphere was great. We ate on the terrace which is not the most glamorous one out there but for a restaurant next to a mall they did a pretty good job. Service was good too. The waitress accommodated us without a hitch when at the last minute I decided to change my salad to fries. 

I didn't get a chance to try the cocktails or the desserts but the selection on the menu seemed quite appealing. 

Tip: When we went through the restaurant on our way out it was quite chilly so if you want to eat inside and you suspect they'll have the A/C on, I'd suggest bringing a sweater.

I'd say overall the restaurant deserves a 3.5 and I loved the quesadillas so much I almost gave them their own star!"}
{"text":"Gave me a dirty glass with lipstick on it. Didn't compensate for it. Drinks were very tasty."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Toronto and stopped by on a Monday Night for a quick bite and some drinks. 
My drink was the Blue raspberry Lemonade... It was a nice blue color but it was very watered down. Specially after a few minutes when some of the ice melted, it just tasted like lemon flavored water. 

My husband ordered 2 different apple ciders. The first one was nice & cold. The 2nd one came in a can and it wasn't cold at all. It was room temperature. 

We also ordered a pizza which was ok but nothing to die for."}
{"text":"Came here with a work colleague and was surprised to see how big of a place this restaurant was!  

I ordered the Vegetarian pizza.  It comes with an assortment of vegetables with arugula and balsamic glaze on top.  Pizza came out and the first thing I noticed was the amount of garlic on the pizza.  So while I was eating I continually pulled off garlic pieces (as I like garlic but don't need to eat the equivalent of 5 bulbs for lunch!) as there was WAY too much!  There was a hefty amount of arugula on top but less balsamic glaze.  Flavour was okay but the chef really doesn't know hoe to do this pizza the JA way!  

I've eaten this pizza while in Ontario and it has been spectacular.  Not this over garlic'ed version here!  

Restaurant was a bit louder than my liking, as you really had to raise your voice to have a conversation.  Restaurant was not full either.  It would be a stampede of noise here on a busy day!  

Server was attentive and polite but my experience was not the best!  With so many places here in Centrepolis I don't think I'll be back unless I have to!"}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times, as it's a convenient location to go before a movie.  All the stuff on John is kinda hit or miss, just like this place...

Service was good/fast.  Decor is super dated but unlikely they'll ever change that.  Loads of seats/dinner available at dinner.

Steak Frites - Steak was cooked perfectly, but was smaller than when I've had it at other locations.
Truffle Fries - Warm-ish with barely any toppings.  Server brought me a side dish of grated parmesan when I pointed this out...
Beer - Tasted like it should

My friend had the chicken sandwich, and she said it didn't have enough of the sauce on it.

I'll most likely return since it's a convenient place and slightly better than Milestone's across the street.  Just hope next time is a 'hit' instead of a 'miss'."}
{"text":"Perfectly Cooked Steak.  Wow.

OK, so I don't really like Jack Astor's normally.  Only went to watch TFC lose (like most Toronto teams do), and JA locations are good for watching games.  I forgot to eat dinner beforehand, so had to get food there.  Usually I detest what they serve and their prices are ridiculous on some things (ex. Wings... Jesus).

Ordered Steak Frites.  The steak was a tad fattier than I would have liked but holy hell, it was cooked PERFECTLY.  I always order Medium Rare and this was exact.  Pink throughout but hot.  Steaks at restaurants are always overcooked or cold in my opinion.  So surprised by JA!

It came with these delicious truffle parmesan fries.  They were awesome!  

Our server, Avery, was great too.  She checked in frequently, had lots of helpers to dispense the food and drinks to us, and even poured our beer for each of us out of the pitcher.  One drink order got messed up, but that was through a different server that was checking in on us.  No biggie (though it was an expensive scotch).

The reason for the one star off;  it took a while to get our seat, despite a reservation and open tables everywhere.

This is a lot longer review than I intended.  I think I was just surprised but what a good experience I had at a Jack Astor's.  Will definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"So, my expectations are never that high when coming to chains like this, but it had a nice patio overlooking dundas square, so I was sold. 

We came on a monday night, so we were quickly seated on the patio, and our food was fresh when it came out , which is always nice! We ordered one of those huge fish bowls which was 99% juice (if it weren't illegal, I'd encourage people to bring a shot or five to top off the drinks). The chicken fingers and fries were fresh and crispy. 

Service was...just sad, one couple actually got seated and just walked out because the server kept disappearing (and not coming back for long stretches). After you've gotten everything you've ordered, don't expect to see anyone for at least 40 minutes...which isn't all bad if you don't need anything, I guess.

The view is nice, and things are relatively inexpensive, so maybe just come for the view :)"}
{"text":"been here several times and everytime is a little different. The one consistent thing is the  bad music blaring over the speakers. I bet the dj is a close friend or relative of the manager.  most of the time though the service is ok. except the last time was probably the worst experience i have had at jack astors. For starters they seated us in the wrong section.  the chili nachos really had no beef in it for the topping and was all of 2 spoons on top for the extra $$. 
Everywhere we went on the patio smoking area the servers kept asking us to go somewhere else. Eventually at the end of the evening, they overcharged us for the beer. Third time I have caught them doing that. Need to find another after work place for beers..."}
{"text":"Update on review. After a negative experience the manager addressed issues and we went back for dinner with a much better experience. Thank you for resolving issues. The fact that he cared is 5 stars in itself."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with family while visiting TO.    Food was tasty but low on the price to value scale.  Also didn't appreciate the skimpy outfits worn by the serving staff.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night with a group of friends. We were seated within 5 minutes. I ordered the Italian burger with regular fries as a side. It comes with goat cheese, balsamic drizzle, garlic, garlic aioli, onions, tomatoes and arugula. I'm generally a big fan of all these ingredients which is why I ordered this. The beef was quite juicy, could've been cooked a bit shorter but I'm glad it wasn't dry! The sauce was slightly too tangy to my liking. Everything else was good! I liked the generous portion and the fries were crispy. Service was pretty good too. Food came a bit slow but everyone's basically came all at once. I would visit again!"}
{"text":"Slightly above average sports bar plenty of tv, the food also slight above average had the salmon and the steak. Salmon not so good but the steak was excellent overall two thumbs up"}
{"text":"En tant que végétalienne, j'étais heureuse d'avoir l'option de remplacer toutes viandes/produits laitiers par du tofu. Les assiettes sont bonnes, mais un peu dispendieuses pour le contenu ($22.00 pour des pâtes de riz & du tofu...).

Tous les cocktails valent la peine par contre!! Délicieux pour la bouche, pour les yeux aussi."}
{"text":"Just finished paying for our bill almost 2 hours after sitting down. Our server was a pleasant young lady by the name of Beth. We continued to lose our server over the coarse of the meal. Through out the night we asked for several things (ie drinks, more salsa ect...). Instead of taking care of our table our server was seen doing everything but helping us out. I saw her busing tables, setting new tables and talking to other servers rather than getting what we had asked for. The food was ok, but the service was awful..."}
{"text":"The menu had a lot of options from salad amd soup to burgers and steaks. The Buddha salad was tasty with goat cheese and dried fruit. The sangria is also great. It has the fruit nase separate from the wine so you mix it yourself. The garlic bread was heavenly - drenched in butter amd plenty of fresh garlic."}
{"text":"Good bar and grille with an upscale, laid back atmosphere.  Food was solid.  Had beer & cheese soup as an appetizer, BBQ smoke burger was delicious.  Have craft beer on tap, I went with 3 different IPA, from lighter to heavier, all were good.  Service was excellent.  Would patronize again."}
{"text":"Been here a thousand times. They claim to be an American style burger joint but after fully exploring their burgers I discovered how amazing their steak is. Either way you can't lose. The service is friendly and timely, the price is fair, and the Cesar's are perfect."}
{"text":"This is your typical chain restaurant/sports bar.  The only reason I ever attend here is when meeting friends for pints or wings before or after a game/concert at the ACC or Rogers Centre.  The location is decent for the fact that it's close to the before-mentioned venues, as well as to Union Station.  I last attended with a friend who is celiac and he was impressed with their gluten-free options.  I also noticed that the hostess desk will hold suitcases for travellers coming into or going out of Union Station.  Two stars for it's convenient location."}
{"text":"Met up with a pal here for drinks and some food. The food is your run of the mill pub food; the menu is extensive so there's something for everyone should you dine here as a group. I like the location as well. Conveniently located at the corner of Yonge and Bloor, you're only a few steps away from the subway. The reason why I'm giving this place a four star is the service - it was excellent. The staff here are attentive and super efficient; our plates were cleared as soon as we were done and drinks were brought to us even before asking. 

Good for: drinks, groups, dinner"}
{"text":"Great service! Very kid friendly.  I had the chicken fingers and they were moist and fresh and their fries were crispy.  Great place for average priced food.  I like the atmosphere.  Wish there was a bigger menu tho."}
{"text":"I don't want to be one of those vegans who give a bad review of a place based on the vegan options at a primarily meat based restaurant, but I'm going too. The reason for my annoyance, for all the veggies reading, is that the Veggie Burger cannot, or at least should not be eaten by any vegetarian. The waitress was nice enough to inform me that it is cooked alongside the beef burgers, ruining any chance this restaurant had of me enjoying a meal here. To their credit the waitress did let me know about this before I had to ask, which I can only hope is a regular practice for all the wait staff there and the only reason they're getting 2 stars. It's nice to get the warning.

As far as I can see there's only 2 types of people who would order a Veggie Burger; a vegetarian, or someone looking for a healthier option with less fat. Well this grease soaked burger screws us both. Thanks for trying though Jack's, you obviously realized there was a market here that you wanted to exploit, unfortunately you missed the point completely. The one and only meal I could eat was the vegetable fajita and luckily you really can't mess up fried vegetables on tortillas, but I've definitely had better. 

I would never have gone to this place if it hadn't been a work related outing and hopefully I will never have to go again. If you're a vegetarian, do yourself a favour and avoid this place. Like I needed to tell you."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that the service here was freaking fantastic. We came in on a whim before dropping some people off at the airport, and had a pretty big group with us. The hostess was super friendly and seated us quickly in a more private area at the back. It's like they could sense that we were going to be a somewhat boisterous group.

Our server, Courtney was one of the best. Anything we asked for, he made it happen. He was also super friendly, funny, and meshed really well with our group. We really wanted mimosas, and while Jack Astors really doesn't seem like a mimosas and brunch type of place, we had them in under 5 minutes. He was extremely accommodating, and even allowed me to order off of the kids menu (this is huge in my book for any restaurant as the bigger portions tend to be too much for me).

We did have more people arrive after our food orders were put in, and even that transition was made a smooth one. Adding the additional orders to our bill, more chairs to the table, etc. Food arrived quickly, and was hot & tasty. No complaints from anyone at the table. Our water (and other drink) glasses were never left more than empty without someone coming over to make sure we weren't ready for a refill. 

Now for my favorite part. It was a friends birthday, and what else does one do at a restaurant on a birthday but embarrass that friend as much as possible. I let Courtney know about this, and towards the end of our meal he walks out with the most hilarious birthday surprise I've ever seen at a restaurant. Once again, it was like he knew what we were thinking. I feel like that's the best type of service, having server right there knowing what you want before you even request it.

We're near that area often when friends do shows in Toronto and need to drop talent off at the airport, and I have a feeling that this Jack Astors is going to be our new go-to for pre-flight lunches."}
{"text":"I tried the world famous chicken tenders and it tasted like normal tenders. They did have this really good sauce on the side and the fries were good too. Btw, the food came out fast!"}
{"text":"Relatively new to the North York area.  Wanted to give this place a better rating, if only b/c it's got a pretty sweet patio and the proximity to Novotel where I normally stay is super convenient.

Think they need to work through some growing pains but definitely shows promise.  Food was pretty good, although my burger took so long they took it off the bill without me even complaining.  A for effort for sure.

Had some trouble convincing them to change the channel initially even though we were the only ones in the front section.  Eventually they figured it out and got us squared away.

Will definitely be back when I'm in town.  Waitresses wear shirts with interesting sayings on the back.  One of them said, \"certified hokey pokey instructor.\"  I can definitely see myself getting shitfaced and asking them to prove it."}
{"text":"Gostei do lugar, porções gostosas e o preço é bom! É um pub, meio escurinho, com telas passando esportes ou clipes, música ambiente. Garçons atenciosos. Porém as vezes a fila de espera é bem grande."}
{"text":"I come here often and I must say this last visit left a really good impression on me. You want to know how good? Well I only open Yelp to leave bad reviews, so ya, that good. My order got confused by mistake and the staff could not have possibly be more attentive. All the way from the waitress to the manager. The only horrific thing that happened is that that my girlfriend canceled plans for that night but that's not Jack Astor's fault."}
{"text":"I CANNOT believe I am giving this place a four star! Jack Actor's has really changed... They had an Ahi Tuna Slaw.. Which I ordered and liked a lot! The tuna seemed fresh even though I went there on a Tuesday night! Also  split a short tray of BBQ nachos among friends, which was delicious but you get a fraction of what you get when you order a regular nacho plate.

I am not a dessert person but have recently developed a sweet tooth which craves chocolate brownies! They have $1.44 small piece of chocolate brownie with caramel and a medium size rosette of whip cream... It hits the spot and is not a thousand calories! What a great idea! I love the little brownie and love that they serve it with pretty caramel scribbles and a little bit of whip cream! 

Overall, their new and improved menu has made me reconsider their status on my places of go to restaurants."}
{"text":"I had low expectations which were exceeded. The chicken fingers were very good and the service was pleasant. I had the burger which was only okay.

Competent but far from amazing. I'd give this place a 3.5 if I could, but I rounded it up to 4."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and even though we had to wait 10 minutes to be seated, was still fast considering how busy they were for a Saturday night.  And fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"ok, first the receptionist. she is nice. she showed us our table and bolt.
the waiter, hard to find. and then the food.
omg, the food was horrid. 

I guess if you are going for the environment, this place is quite nice.
you can hang out with friends, loud place, listen to music, watch dozen of tv's (small tv) and eat bad food."}
{"text":"This is just on sad burger, I rather go to mcdonalds to get a buttermilk chicken sandwich that is wayyyyyyy better than this crapass burger, first off the chicken is dry as hell, piece of lettuce, tomato and a big ass bun that does not even taste fresh....jacks u need to take this item off the menu ...otherwise the atmosphere is nice and service was not bad
Would not come back for the food ever"}
{"text":"Popped in here after some Christmas shopping at Sherway since my growing nephew (11) was starved. Actually, my wife and I were pretty hungry too. 

Saturday at about 7 pm this place is pretty happening. Very full of people of all ages and groups and dates and they all seemed pretty happy. Also we did. Or have to wait long for a seat. 

The 50 or so waitresses and waiters are all very nice and helpful. Seems a little disorganized at times but it works. 

The music is loud the TVs all over the place give the place a fun vibe. And the crayons and brown paper on the tables give you a chance to be creative. 

The food options are standard Canadian type fare with burgers, nachos, some full entrees, steaks, and even include curry, salmon and pretty much anything you might want. 

We had one chicken fingers and fries which was delicious. Real chicken and very tender. And one chicken club sandwich which was a little on the small side but very good with lots of bacon and mayo. And finally we had a stir fry with rice from the kids menu which comes with a dessert and my nephew chose a cookie to go. 

With a beer, and some lemon milkshake that my wife had, we paid like $75. 

Overall very satisfied with the service and quality of the food as well as the fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've visited this location a lot over the past year and it just gets better and better. The last two times I went we had the unfortunate luck of falling victim to botched service.  One time our beers took a little longer than management would have liked so it was comp'd. (No complaints were mentioned by us)  Awesome! We had ordered the lettuce wraps and asked for no peanuts and it came with peanuts..no problem, comp'd! There was an error with our bill and we were double charged for an item....instead of a refund (approx. $15 and would have taken sometime since the credit card charge had to be reversed) the manager offered us the option of taking a $20-$25 (I don't remember) savings coupon that we could use on our next visit.  Sweet! Overall, despite the mishaps which were honest mistakes and the fact that management took ownership of them was pretty awesome.  The ambiance is great, food is aways as expected and they have a great selection of beers. So with that said, I'll definitely be returning to this location and Jack Astors in general."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday night with a group. It was cold and other restaurant establishments were either dead or closing and we didn't want to pay cover to go somewhere and just have a drink. So we ended up here, which is pretty random. It was pretty busy and noisy in the bar section. There are several TV's playing hockey and basketball, while club anthems blast from the speakers -- odd. The booths and tables were mostly dudes watching the game and drinking beer, while the stools by the bar seemed to be all canoodling couple (seriously? who takes a date to Jack Astor's?). As we were a group of women, my friend said \"they should pay us to be here!\" But we were too lazy to go elsewhere, so we sat down for some drinks and snacks. 

The cocktail options all sounded really artificial/overly sweet, so I opted for a white wine sangria. It was kinda disappointing -- you could barely taste the wine. It was like orange juice! My friend's Caesar was okay. At least drinks here are cheap! $6.70 for most mixed drinks. We shared the guacamole, which was like the grocery store variety -- no chunks of avocados and kind of processed. The tortilla chips were good though. We also had the bruschetta which was a better choice. Super garlic-y and the tomatoes were fresh. 

Service was passable. Our server was chipper and enthusiastic (although it's not helpful when we ask about different appetizers and she says \"oh that one's really good\" for everything). It was clear that they didn't want us to stay if we weren't gonna keep drinking... The second I took the last sip of my sangria, my glass was removed in the blink of an eye. Oh well, it's not the kind of place to linger and have real conversation (we tried, but we were shouting). 

Good location near Union though, and the patio looks like it would be nice in the summer. More sports-oriented than what I'm into, but understandable given the proximity to the Rogers Centre/ACC. Lots of peeps in jerseys. So it may be a fun place to watch the game, but I wouldn't go back otherwise."}
{"text":"We had our work Christmas lunch here yesterday and overall it was fine. 

The food was decent, I started with a salad (average) and then had a chicken bowl (picture sweet and sour chicken with veggies and rice). The desserts were nothing to write home about, although the portions were huge. The options were either donut holes with dipping sauces (I found them really dry) and little crepes with sauce inside. The last time I ate here I had a burger which I thought was excellent. 

Considering the size of our group and the fact people were moving around the service was good and the meals came out pretty fast. Overall a decent lunch and ok place for a large group."}
{"text":"The Epic burger is really Epic  l'ambiance est sympa, la décoration est chill et ça peut être un endroit sympa pour regarder un match de hockey ou pour passer une soirée chill entre amis"}
{"text":"Great patio, so-so servers. Food here is good and portion sizes are worth the price. 

It's not high end dining but I really like jack astors. Love their buffalo chicken fingers, they do a pretty good pizza too considering its not a pizza place. Nachos are really big, the veggie burger is terrible here! So avoid that imo. Cool place to grab a few drinks and a bite to eat. I like how casual it is."}
{"text":"Very friendly people! Been there many times when I am craving burgers, nachos, salad or pasta. Service is a bit slow sometimes but most of the times it's good. Food is pretty much speechless. But it might be on the pricey side. Much would totally recommend."}
{"text":"Nice service and the waitress Josee is very helpful, excellent food, awesome atmosphere during the game! I would definitely come back here"}
{"text":"This is the only Jack Astors I went to.....this place was fun...our waitress was great...food solid and I had plenty of cold beverages to make it awesome.

After my week in Toronto I think there was about 15 other Jack Astor's...I assume they are all similar and kina the same.

Def recommend to a new person in the area they have great service standards from what I saw"}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday afternoon. It was dead in the restaurant and it took 15 minutes to get a drink. We were served by three different servers all of which didn't seem to be talking to each other. When our bill was brought they didn't ask if we wanted it split up they simply brought us one bill. The salt had a red substance in it that had jammed the entire container,  the music being played was terrible for the time of day. 
Food was standard chain food, nothing special or noteworthy. If they step up their servers training and tweak the musical choice it might be worth your time."}
{"text":"Bartender gave me a beer in a piping hot glass out of the dishwasher, I hate that. Chicken fingers that they were famous for were just decent. So why two stars? Because several of the girls who worked there were hot as shit, usually I don't care about that but they were like out of a magazine. It must be like a Canadian Hooters or something, short skirts and low cut shirts. So two stars. I left after one beer..."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, just a sports bar, but with friendly staff and a really big place. So it's great if you are a big group and looking for a place big enough on a weekend."}
{"text":"What an odd place. 

It gets compared to American chains like Chilis, Fridays and Applebees, but the workers wear tees with amusing, snarky statements instead of \"pieces of flair\" and the walls are adorned with Far Side prints instead of cheesy memorabilia. The menu is somewhat similar, but it definitely has its own distinctive vibe.

Our sons loved drawing on the paper they freshly lay on tables for each new set of diners. There's the usual kids' menu to draw on, but the options are more diverse than other chains. 

They have a ton of TVs. In fact, they have several sets of 4 TVs: two big TVs with sports and a couple smaller TVs  playing the Jack channel or something that's basically a lot of viral videos strung together. It was a little too busy an arrangement for me. Nothing worth getting a neck kink over, considering the awkward placement.

I had a big lunch elsewhere so I skipped dinner and just had fried dough for dessert. Unfortunately it was overcooked. My sons ate most of it.

My drink was too sweet, but I picked it knowing full well it might be. 

I forget what everyone else thought of their meals just like I almost forgot to write this review because I wasn't sure what I made of the whole experience. Overall, food was okay. Ambiance was unique, but all over the place. Service was great."}
{"text":"I tried visiting this location twice and the second time I was successful but not satisfied by any means. First of all I am not a big fan of the venue itself, it is small, cramped, requires you travel up several sets of escalators with a confusing exit and there is ALWAYS a wait no matter what time you go. It is located beside the theatre at Dundas Square and although it should be a convenient option when out to see a movie the food court located just below would be a way better option as tourists and it seems everyone in the city gravitates to this one, small pub overlooking dundas square. I will say the patio is the only unique and redeaming feature about this place but hardly worth the wait and parking cost.

The service here I was never disatisfied with though, I found the hostesses, bartenders and servers fairly pleasant, courtious and knowledgeable with prompt service. But I must say I was not impressed with the quality and consistancy of the food here; chains all prepare and serve their dishes exactly alike for many reasons and when a location fails to do so I feel it brings down the overall image and value of the chain itself.

The menu was a jumble of mismatched items and although there was variety much of it was lost in the fine and cluttered print and presentation of the menu itself.  Jack Astors was never on the top of my list for restaurants to dine in but I do adore their girly drinks like the twister both origional and mango raspberry as well as the red rockets. However this time I did not enjoy many of the drinks that I usually love, it could have been a matter of bartending skills I'm not sure but many things about this location do not seem to be in line with the same standard as I have come to expect from the chain.

I was never really a fan of the kindergarden let's write my name in crayon on the table but that is unfortunately not the worst thing about this location and considering I have given it 2 solid chances I am going to refrain from giving it another."}
{"text":"I have visited this jacks out of convenience many times and my experience varies each time but it's never really bad

I find the service and food to be faster, more reliable and consistent in the morning, night time seems to be busier and the service greatly suffers. 
Most of the staff is incredibly young and do not know how to handle large volumes but I do find them reasonably friendly however the lack of experience really shows especially at busy times. Incorrect orders are not uncommon at these times and drink orders seem to take forever with a great deal of inconsistency.

 The mixed drinks are quite expensive when u think about where you are and what your getting the blue raspberry lemonade is little over $11, maybe Im not a big mix drinker but i find that a little steep for a simple mixed drink. Still i am
Absolutely addicted to the twisters they are well worth the price, absolutely delicious! At one point I loved the drink called \"red rocket\" I believe but I remember ordering it at this location twice and both times it tasted totally different. That is one thing I will say about jack Astors, they do not have consistency across the board and from such a large chain I come to expect this.

They have a large patio and dining area but I'm not fond of the bar area... A long channel of high top tables and small booths gives me an awkward feeling like being in a stall like environment with tvs everywhere contained in a cramped space surrounded by glass.

However I have rarely been disappointed by the food which is usually very good, everything from steaks, spinach dip to chicken fingers have always been good and the presentation has been very clean as well. My only negative experience was not my own but happened to a friend; they got extremely ill from the lobster and crab dip but that was the only bad thing I can mention.

All in all I will def return here as it is one of the most convenient jacks for me to come to, expensive or not I like a lot of the mixed drinks offered and the food is usually good, seems to always be a larger bill but I still enjoy the experience"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have been to Jack's so my bestie treated me for my bday the other day. I have been here multiple times and have sat everywhere except in dining.

I love that this place has ample parking, it's located right off of Dixon beside highway 27. Traffic can get a little tricky here in rush hr but it's not too bad. As far as the area goes there is tons of competition and I do feel like the other chains are simply outdoing jacks now. You are greeted promptly on arrival at this location and as I mentioned they do have multiple areas to sit. The bar yields fast service and I haven't had a bad experience yet, they all were knowledgable and friendly. The drinks are where they kind of fall flat; they are incredibly overpriced and watered down. Most if not all bars tend to \"over ice\" but here they almost seem to over do even that standard. Caesars are watery, even jacked up.... The mixed cocktails are tasty but with the hefty price tag I wouldn't call them worth it. Most are centered around intense sugar shots with cheap liqueurs. They have a decent sangria but it certainly doesn't hold a candle to the nearby competitors like moxy's, Montana's... Even Boston pizza.

The patio at this location is smaller then other jacks I've been to but with a decent amount of seating that's not too crammed. It is faced the glaring sun at sunset, which was when I visited unfortunately which does make for an uncomfortable seating arrangement for anyone facing a certain way. I've never been a big fan of the scribbling server names in crayon on the tables so I usually avoid the dining room... Though it is a fairly open concept throughout the restaurant and the tables look spacious.

I ordered a Brie burger and my friend the veggie burger.... I feel like presentation wise things have dropped. Very barren and kind of sloppy, though there are many tasty options on the menu they don't exactly arrive looking that way. Taste wise it was decent but really nothing too special and again considering the price tag they could put a tad more effort into things. 

It's really a fairly neutral opinion ive developed about this place, I'm not adverse to going back but with all the options that may not be soon"}
{"text":"We go here quite often for my company lunches. We always have a few tables reserved. The service is quite good here overall, and they have a greeter in their outdoor area, too.

The food comes slowly, but they have TVs to distract their customers. Their drinks are decent, and food is above average quality. They have quite a large menu, although I'm not a fan of steak, burgers, and pizza, so usually I end up getting the pastas here, which are great. The portions are good, usually I get full quickly. 

Overall a great place for any age group to have a meal together."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times. On average, their service is slow. I recently went with a party of 8, and they crammed us around a table that could probably fit 5 or 6 people max. 

Their new menu has WAYY too much (TINY!) text and is almost unreadable in the dim lighting. On the upside, the prices are tax included. 

The food portions seem to really vary. The trend seems to be that the more you pay, the smaller your portions are. I've been pretty lucky with portions. I've gotten jerk pork and lamb kafta recently, both fairly priced and great portions. Their pasta dishes are tiny. Also, my friends remarked that their pad thai is overly sweet.

Their nachos are extremely salty for some reason. Great calamari and crab dip though.

Overall - good atmosphere and usually doesn't get too busy. Food quality is definitely above average. Their service, food portions per dollar, and wait times could use some work though."}
{"text":"Came here before taking in a baseball game at the Rogers Center between the Jays and the Yankees. Its seems to be your typical chain bar like you have in the States. Reminds me of a TGI Fridays/Applebees with a bigger bar. Food was meh and service was very slow trying to get a refill to choke down the dry food."}
{"text":"I only have one statement to add for this restaurant. 

The tomato in my salad was half black & mouldy. 

What else can you say about this place. If you serve a mouldy tomato you get one star. End of story!"}
{"text":"This is a delightful family restaurant. As luck would have it...I went with some of my family members. 
The service was very good. Delightful young lady that was efficient & fast. The only comment on the food that I have for this review is...The famous Jack Astors Chicken Fingers were delicious....end of story."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch here yesterday. It was a very busy Friday but we were there early enough to be ahead of the crowd. I ordered the Jack Astors Garlic Bread (didn't know that a full loaf is 800 calories!!!) as the appie. 

I also ordered a basic salad with chicken. It tasted very good but our server (who was a delightful young lady) took forever to get me my meal. It makes it a little uncomfortable when your business prospect has to wait until you get your food!! It would have been a 4* if it weren't for the timing of the food delivery."}
{"text":"This was a group gathering for my Wife's Chorus annual concert. There was a group of 16 for dinner. 

The table was set & ready for us when we arrived which was very good. The down side was they were out of many beer that was on Tap & what they had was only cool, not cold the way I like it.

The service was only good but not great. For the chicken fingers that I ordered the salt content was off the scale & I had to repeatedly ask for extra buffalo sauce even though I asked for them to be heavily sauced in the first place. I don't get restaurants in general...pay attention to what your customer orders in the beginning as it would make the whole process so much easier. 

This is a very average restaurant with an average menu."}
{"text":"Thieves maliciously lurk this bar since they know it's frequented by tourists. Keep your friends close and your wallet even closer!"}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised by our Jack Astor's experience yesterday.  The restaurant has definitely stepped up its game.

We sat outside and enjoyed a few beverages - excellent selection of beer and the sangria was very refreshing.  Noshed on some chicken skewers and the vegetarian nacho board.  Very good flavours and nicely presented.

Service was very good by the team and our designated server."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here as it had outdoor seating and it was a nice day. The food is very average and not that amazing. It is a good place if you are in a group and want to sit outside and have some snacks and a drink - but not really to eat."}
{"text":"Pretty good service on a Monday night, I was sad to see that their menu keeps on changing so much. I really loved the Veg Out Pizza, and was so disappointed they don't offer it anymore. So instead I ordered the famous chicken tenders, which were delicious, unfortunately the fries were pretty dry, but the two sauces they serve with the dish were amazing. 

Definitely recommend the Blue Raspberry Lemonade!"}
{"text":"I came here late on a Saturday night with a group of 8. 
We decided to get a few drinks and dessert. 

The service here was a bit slow, which normally would be fine if it was busy, but I could see about half of the restaurant was empty. 

The brownie dessert was not great. 

I got the World's Most Ridiculously Small Brownie, and it was below average. I was hoping the brownie might be a little warm, but it was actually pretty cold and hard. It came with a caramel drizzle which didn't really enhance the dish at all. I also got the vanilla ice cream to add on, and it wasn't that great. Safe to say, I definitely regret getting that dessert."}
{"text":"I've come here twice now, and the service is always great here. 

They have a great selection of drinks! My usual Go-To is the Blue Raspberry Lemonade"}
{"text":"I have come here a couple of times now, and I've found the service and food to be pretty good. 
Most recently, I came here on a Game Day so naturally, it was pretty busy. Something to note, is on game days, Jack Astors doesn't take reservations. 

We ordered the standard beer and veggie nachos to start,  and they were great. The Nachos were especially tasty because they drizzled some sort of chipotle sauce on top which added a great flavour. 

Normally, Jack Astors has amazing Chicken Tenders so I decided to order it this time around. To be honest,  The chicken was great, but the fries were just lukewarm. 

Protip, if you get the buffalo sauce on the side, it tastes so much better! Otherwise, if it's tossed in the sauce, the strips can get pretty soggy."}
{"text":"Good service on a Thursday evening, especially during a busy night when there was a Raptor's game on. We both ordered their famous chicken tenders and fries which were great, except the fries were extremely salty. So definitely watch out for that."}
{"text":"My second time going to a Jack Astor's and it was just as great as the first time. We went on a Saturday night to catch the Habs game. The place was busy but we were seated promptly. Our server came over rather quick for how busy the place was. She picked up on our lack of French and accommodated us with English menus. Made our lives much easier. 

We both got burgers and drinks and enjoyed both. My bacon cheeseburger was excellent, my beer was never empty and my girlfriend's \"Cool Breeze\" was a wonderfully prepared cocktail. 

We hung out in the bar area after our meals and the staff was cool with that. We later got guacamole and chips and I was impressed yet again. The guacamole was just out of this world. Seemed freshly prepared and full of flavor. 

All I can ask is that Jack Astor's comes Stateside if they aren't already!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service wasn't. They were very late in whatever we asked at the rooftop bar."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and had a decent time.

I ordered the Mediterranean chicken focaccia which was tasty until I ate a piece of hair. I know it's gross but I didn't freak out. However, the staff took care of the issue for me and I got another sandwich which was hair-free. They also apologized for the situation and honestly, it shouldn't have happened but at the same time, we're only human so there's only so much we can control.

Anyway, after that incident, we had great service for the rest of meal (not that the service was bad to begin with, it was just beyond good service after).

I'm not a chain restaurant type of girl but once and a while, I don't mind going to a Jack because of location (it's close to the Eaton Centre)."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of this Jack Astor because I find the service to be lacking here. It took forever for food to come and the place wasn't even busy! I ordered a pizza here and the only flavour it had was salt. Thank goodness for the salad on top of the pizza to balance out the flavour a bit. It was quite an odd pizza to eat so I wouldn't order it again.
I would come back to Jack, not for a full meal but perhaps just appetizers or desserts because I think they do those the best. For a meal, I would choose one of the other restaurants close by before coming here!"}
{"text":"I like this place for the quirky decors and usually good service. The food here is pretty standard - burgers, pizzas and steaks.

My favorite thing here is their garlic bread. It's very soft and there's a lot of garlic taste to it.

Everything else I got at this restaurant doesn't stand out to me. It doesn't taste bad nor does it taste amazing. However, it is a good restaurant to go to if you don't want to take any risks with bad service or horrible food.

There's a wide variety of things to choose from their menu so there's bound to be something for everyone."}
{"text":"I think this location is one of the better Jack. I always get good service here and there hasn't been anything wrong with the food. I come here often just for a snack or dessert (especially in the summer time) after a day of shopping. 

The must get is the garlic bread with cheese (I've been loving it since high school). I find the Cesar salad very salty because it was heavily drenched in salad dressing. I believe I got some sort of Tex-Mex burger which was delicious for the most part. I don't think the burger is part of the permanent menu but I may be wrong."}
{"text":"Jack Astor's is what it is. Average food with average prices. Nice bar set up. Service is always slow however and they often miss requests."}
{"text":"This restaurant is what you would expect. Nice patio dining, food is good but not amazing. What was amazing was our waiter CoCo! He made the experience so much more pleasurable. He was hilarious and attentive and made me want to post a review. \"I'm in love with the CoCo!\""}
{"text":"If you are in the area it's the perfect spot to watch a hockey game and have some good food.
I highly recommend the \"Holy Smoke BBC burger\". The meat, the bread, basically everything about this burger is fresh and tastes awesome. The fries however are pretty good but nothing gorgeous.
They have a great beer selection and from what I saw the wine menu is pretty big as well.
And last but not least, friendly motivated staff!"}
{"text":"This place is a little disappointing. The portions are quite small for the price you're paying and the food itself really isn't great. Although the waiters are friendly, you might have to wait a very long time before you get your food, especially if you're a bigger group. For your birthday, they make you stand on your chair and sing along to a song and they also provide kids with paper and crayons so they can draw while they're waiting for their food, which I think is great. All in all, it's a good restaurant to go to with your family, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Really nice place and great service.  The bartenders are really fun and many of them know some great tricks and are part of the \"flare league\".  They make some great drinks and are great at keeping the drinks full.  We didn't eat much since we went after dinner but we did have the garlic flat bread with cheese on top and it was AMAZING.  We heard we had to try this and it really was worth it.

The outdoor patio is really great and large... we would have stayed out there but it started to rain.  But the inside really was great and a fun atmosphere.  I recommend this place and would go back.  The food looked good, so I would try it next time.  Great location, too.

The shirts are so much fun to read, but I would say that they don't sell them anymore which is lame.  We asked why and they told us it was because they sold too many and didn't have enough to wear for their uniforms.  I have the solution... buy more!  It is not a problem when you sell too many!"}
{"text":"I was very surprised about my wonderful experience at the Richmond Hill Jack Astor's, since all of my previous experience at various Jack Astor's (Yonge/Dundas or Yonge/Bloor) was mediocre at best. I decided to give this a shot after receiving a $10 off coupon in the mail.
On a busy Saturday, I was able to immediately get a booth at the bar area, which was right beside the dining room.
My sister and I got the small beef nacho board to start. She got the fish & chips and I ordered the chicken fingers with a side of veggies.
The beef nacho was more like oversized hor d'oeuvres than your conventional nachos. It had all the toppings laid on top of 6 large individual chips and you eat each like a flat hard taco. The flavours were great, the peppers and onion gave it a nice kick and there was a mix of textures in every bite.
I enjoyed the chicken fingers, very tender, almost couldn't tell it was white meat. (Other Jack locations served dry dry chicken fingers) The veggies weren't frozen like mainly similar franchised chains. The fish and chips were also decent - fish nice and crisp, well seasoned and not too \"fishy\".
Service wasn't the greatest, our waitress wasn't extremely attentive, but the amount of wait time was reasonable.
I would like to come again to try other stuff."}
{"text":"I feel like Jacks used to be my go-to place when I couldn't figure out a place to have dinner but lately it seems like the prices have gone up, the menu has changed for the worse and the food isn't that great anymore. During this particular visit, my server was excellent but water took 10 mins because they didn't have cups, the bill took really long at the end, and my food wasn't that great. It's too bad because I used to really enjoy this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have been to this Jack Astors many times over the past few years as it is very close to the office and very conveniently located beside Union Station.

This location has a weird musky, cabin smell when you first walk in but you get used to it after a while...there is tons of seating and tvs; perfect when all other restaurants in the area are fully booked before a big game or during the holidays.

My impression of this location is great; I've never had a problem with the food or service. I usually get the salmon salad (~$19).. but I believe they have now changed the menu and it is no longer there, boo!!

PS. They do not take reservations Friday evenings and before big games or concerts."}
{"text":"We were looking for someplace to eat near our hotel and walked by this place. There was a good crowd in the outside seating but we were able to get a table inside right away, although it filled up by the end of the night. Service was friendly. Wait staff seemed to be confused at first but our waiter informed us that it was the staff party night so most of the staff was pulled in from other locations - considering that they still did pretty well. Food was pretty good - I ordered the big meatball. Definitely a lively place, with outdoor seating and lots of TVs inside.
Overall nothing remarkable but a solid choice if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. I must say I'm a regular. Thought I would do a review at this place. Probably the best jacks I've been to,  everybody is friendly, they like to keep things good and satisfy their customers, especially the servers. At the bar, I love the service great environment in there. If you go a few times they will remember you for sure. I always feel like a VIP. Great location."}
{"text":"Went here for beer and appys. Hot day today over 30 and the AC was broken in the lounge. The service was mediocre we had at least 4 different waitresses. Food was ok but the Asian nachos should be done differently you cannot take them apart to eat you get a giant glob."}
{"text":"I stayed at a downtown condo for Pan Am weekend and was recommended to check out Jack Astor's for some decent bar food. I went there with the least of expectations but this place is surprisingly good. I had the poutine which was solid and also got the chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. Don't judge me on indulging in fries! I was just celebrating National Fry Day early!"}
{"text":"Jack Astor's patio is forever calling my name on any bright summer's day, so decided to drop by this location at the Shops on Don Mills. Parking is a little limited close to the main shops area, but there is a three level parking garage. I have to admit, I'm usually suspicious of any franchised restaurant, but I'm a fan of Jack Astor's. They have a fun and changing menu with some great hits. They also have a great, comfortable atmosphere. 

The servers were quick and efficient, however the kitchen was not that day. Several tables around us were getting anxious for their meal, while we were just happy to be having beers outside on a beautiful day. Next thing we knew the manager was coming out with little mini margaritas for everyone to apologize for the wait. Beer and margaritas? Well done Jack. The margaritas were so good, that we asked for the recipe! Our meal came shorty afterwards and was quite delicious. I had the tortilla crunch burger. It had a nice balance of toppings with the guac, feta, tomatoes and tortilla chips all working together. I love guac on a burger and the tortilla chips added a really nice crunch to what would have otherwise been a mush on mush on mush. My dinnermate had the Montreal smoked meat sandwich, and it must have been good, because I only manage to wrestle some fries off of his plate. 

J. Ast, you have done it again with your wonderfully cold drinks and reasonably priced foods. It was a great topper to an otherwise already sunny day."}
{"text":"nice place to enjoy some beers and a good stake. also nice to hang out a little bit and watch a basketball game with some friends."}
{"text":"You know the food is bad when a burger from McDonald's is better than what they're serving for $20, waste of money and time eating here. We ordered 5 meals and all of them were so mediocre. Won't be going to a Jackastors again because of the low quality we experienced this time all round. I would give them zero stars if I could. For a meal that cost $160 for 5 people, I highly suggest you go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My review of Jack Astors overall is reflected in the one star rating.  Terrible service, pushy, couldn't understand the male server, poor English.  Very unfriendky server. Then the nachos arrived. Very lame looking nachos, not even real cheese , prepackaged fake melt out of a bag  cheese only on a few nachos. The toppings were terrible.  In addition we ordered the 2.99 guacamole which was horrific! Tasted like some green burnt concoction. It didn't even taste like avacado made guacamole.  This was mothers day and supposed to be a special occasion for us and the server made us feel like we were a \"burden\" to him for being there. The beer and wine were served in warm glasses as well. We will never ever go back there again. Bad service, terrible food!"}
{"text":"This is a review for a past experience at Jack Astor's. Which I have to say, for a chain, I quite like Jack's. They have a great atmosphere, and I've never had any issues with staff. They've always been welcoming and friendly. Jack's in Richmond Hill, I really like, especially on game days. I'm a huge hockey fan! As for the food, I've yet to complain about any of the food items on the menu. I love their burgers, juicy, tasty, I'd recommend. As far as appetizers go, whether it's their signature garlic bread (with or without cheese), Stacked Poutine, or Calamari, you can't go wrong. I'm a bit disappointed that they no longer have the chicken dippers as those were AWESOME! Please bring them back (if anyone from Jack's is reading this). On this visit, however, I skipped the apps. Personally, I love their wings and have tried all of the flavours, except for the Toffee/Chipotle which intrigues me. (I'll update this review when I try those bad boys). I went with the Sesame Ginger Garlic wings, which were delicious. Garlic-y, but not over the top, with just a hint of a ginger. Yum. I also like their nachos, although I've only had the \"Old Faithful Macho Nachos\", with and without beef. This time around, it was with beef. Yes, I was getting my carnivore on. :) I didn't have anything fancy to drink, just a ginger-ale. I did, however, indulge in dessert. Unfortunately, I didn't take any pictures (this is becoming a really bad habit), but I intend to go back and will take pictures at that time to include when I update this review. So many food items, not enough meals in a day. Lol. But I would definitely recommend Jack's as a place to go. It's fun with a group, or just for two. Heck, I'd even go by myself!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a sports bar, with plenty of food and drink options. Great service even though a rather rowdy - but fun - atmosphere on the night we went after the Argos had won Quarter Final Greys Cup."}
{"text":"Pretty much what you expect from Jackastors. It's loud and distracting but a good place for a group of friends, or sports fans. I really like their chicken fingers, and desserts. Salads are huge and worth the money, however don't order the pad Thai as you will be disappointed. You are better off going to a real Thai place down the street."}
{"text":"I have zero complaints about this franchise. Each time I order, I know what to expect, I know there's no hidden fees, I know the servers are polite and friendly (sometimes sassy but who doesn't love some sass) and the food will taste just right. I can't even begin to tell you what I've ordered here. Here's what I know and love; bruschetta, beer & cheddar soup, shrimp pad thai, chicken fingers, roadkill chicken sandwich, asiago chicken caesar salad, lettuce wraps, lobster & crab dip, just to name a few. 

They recently renovated the lounge and dining area making for one large restaurant. I'll keep coming back since everything is consistent whether it's lunch, dinner or late night."}
{"text":"Just went back there the other night with my family. The new reno looks great with a large open concept. My meal was really good. Ordered the Club Sandwich. Great sandwich with real chicken breast. Tasted great and I left full. 

However, my wife ordered the Pad Thai Vegetarian salad. They forgot the peanuts and she said the salad was bland at best. 

The kids like their meals. They tasted great but they left hungry. My daughter ordered the fish and chips (she usually is a small eater) and she was taking from her siblings plate by the time she finished hers. 

We would definitely go back and recommend this restaurant. I have never had a bad meal experience here and the new environment is great."}
{"text":"To go to place to chill out on a game night of just hang out jerk friends 

Love their food menu!
Services gets abit slow on busy days 

Never had a complaint about the place"}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  The servers here remember us and always stop by to say hi even when they're not assigned to our table.  They remember what we like and treat us like family.  Check out their pub food specials, wings night and nachos night are fantastic here.  Also, from time to time they have live music playing here.  There was a great jazz band playing tonight!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came late one evening and found that the service was lacking. 
I had asked for no onions in my food which was okey by the waitress and as my food arrived it had onions but replaced 20 mins later. 
My girlfriends pop was flat two times but was replaced again taking up 15 mins. 
Her hand-burger was cold and we were a little angry at sending stuff back so she ate it cold and in her her words 
(it was cold but yummy)
The waitress was more than helping and always had a smile which brought the experience up for us. This was my second Jack Astros ive been two.

Id give it 2 1/2 stars but it does not allow it ."}
{"text":"lacking a little in the service department. But there were plenty of screens around to watch some Canadian football (eh?). The Poutine (French fries, gravy, cheese curds and plenty of other options) was great."}
{"text":"Quality has gone WAY down. I had their chicken tacos and after one bite I couldn't eat it again. It was horrific. So while my date was eating I was stuck drinking water. Their only good thing if their huge plate of nachos. Their burgers are okay, but sorry everything else is horrible."}
{"text":"Jack Astor's has always been one of my favourite places to eat. I've been to several locations as I have moved from Brampton to Toronto to now North York. I've always had superb service at each one and I only expected the same from this location. 
I came here with my boyfriend and at first things were great, we were greeted right away at the door and was told that it was great weather for the patio so we walked up the flight of stairs and was seated by the hostess. She was even nice enough to move the other tables around so I had enough room to jump onto my chair (the stools are pretty high).

But here are where things got bad. While we were taking our time figuring out what we wanted, we realized nobody was coming to our table. We were sitting at our table for nearly 20 minutes and wasn't even offered a glass of water. Meanwhile, the tables around us were getting seated and even had their drinks by now. 

My boyfriend was beyond pissed, but we were still patient while we tried to wave down a waitress. We explained that we have been sitting for awhile and we were ready to order. She said she'd be right back. Um... 10 minutes later and she still didn't come back to our table. We can clearly see her waiting around chatting with another coworker. The table in front of us got their food at this point and we were so upset because they came in later than we did and we weren't even served yet!
I mean... you see us waiting here, how long does it take to scribble down what we want or to offer us a drink??? Or at least apologize?

We were so angry that we just got up and left. And let me say, that this is the first time I've EVER got up and left a restaurant. I'm usually patient because I was a server myself and I know how tough it can be... but this is ridiculous. We must have wasted 30+ minutes there. That is unacceptable. I will not return."}
{"text":"This location use to be one of my favourite places in Newmarket. The last couple of times i went my chicken has been undercooked even after requesting for it to be well done. Their appetizers never disappoint! 

Service is okay."}
{"text":"I typically don't like Jack Astors but I LOVE this place for the patio.
it's like the perfect setting looking over dundas Square BUT it's always the longest wait. You cant make reservations for the patio either so you're looking at usually a 1-2 hour wait, depending on how nice the day is out there. 

The service is awful at this particular location it took my waiter like 30 min to brings drinks and then the food is a long wait as well.  I dont like the loud music particularly because you can hardly hear what the other person is saying across the table from you. 

If you're looking for mellow and quiet, I'd skip this place.

Washrooms are always out of TP, I don't wait is up with the management.  Like other yelpers say, there is a lot of staff but when you need them where are they? 

Another peeve I have is when 3 different people bring you your drink, foods, and other things.  When I tip I'd like to tip ONE person.  When you have to rely on 3 people it gets annoying.

If this place didn't have the nice patio/balcony I'd give it a pass."}
{"text":"We came in with a large party, and the service was absolutely terrible, and it wasn't even busy.  3 People didn't get their food until everyone was finished, and the waitresses were no where to be found. Nothing was discounted. This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had."}
{"text":"Slow and poor service....failed to get our server to get us some water even. Mediocre food. But that's what you get if you go to a place located inside a mall or a multiplex. With so much footfall coming in through the doors they couldn't care less as far as service is considered. They just want you to eat quickly and be gone in 45 mins so they can get the next set of people in. Give it a pass. There are far better places in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went here for the Mayweather fight. Had 2 big tables reserved for the fight and they were amazing seats. Didn't have to pay cover, beer was cold, food was great, waitress was amazing. The atmosphere was also excellent as they turned off the music for the 2 big fights. Would highly recommend this place for any big sorting event."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend on Tuesday for lunch.  

Pros:
- Tasty food
- polite staff (however see the con)

Cons:
- were a bit sneaky about the prices, was not notified that the cost of the sweet potatoes fries was an extra 2.59.


Services (3.5/5 stars) :
The server was friendly and nice.  She came once or twice to check on us, but was not interrupting our conversation.    However she \"tricked\" me into ordering sweet potatoes fries without telling me the cost was a bit extra.  

Ambiance (4.5/5 stars)
The place was pretty full on a Tuesday for lunch, I am guessing during a game it would be even more fun.  The place was clean and looked good.  


Food (4/5 stars)
I ordered a WL burger with sweet potatoes fries when the waitress told me that I can get them instead of the regular fries (she forgot to mentioned it was an extra 2.59$.)  The burger and the fries were tasty.  
My friend ordered chicken fingers with poutine (the waitress did specify that it was an extra $3.00.  

The total came to 46$ with tax and 15% tip. 


Overall I would recommend the place for a quick not super expensive lunch with some privacy."}
{"text":"Its the Canadian TGIF.
My last day in Montreal and decided to leave the city and head to the burbs.
Again is like TGIF, the person that sits you seems not to even give a F$#% about the people and just puts you anywhere. They have free wifi and we asked for the code and she said they dont have wifi, mind you we had already logged into the rest site and it asked for a code free of charge and it said to ask her. 
The waitress was more pleasant and tried to accommodate us since the first person was kind of a snob.

I had fajitas and poutine, i ate everything of my plate the rest didnt like the food so much. Some said it was cold others overcooked etc.

Maybe its a hit or miss place so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Jack Astor's is the kind of place people go to who have no idea about food. Or maybe they want to be seen on the patio on John. You can get pad thai, but it will cost you 16 dollars when you can go get more delicious pad thai else where. This is a place I refuse to go to now. The last time I was there was for a farewell lunch, and I went because of that... I got the rigatoni because I thought pasta is hard to screw up. It tasted fine, but it was overcooked. In a city with so many options and diversity of food,  no one should be going to a place like this unless they are from out of town.

The plus is that you can get tables with paper on, and crayons for drawing. That is the one plus."}
{"text":"Jack Astors is probably one of the most under-rated bar & grill restaurants mainly because of their old image. But after their multiple re-brandings and new menus, they have changed significantly. The food is actually quite amazing and the chefs seem to have much more passion. 
STRONGLY STRONGLY recommend their new Bruschetta appetizer. Trust me. Might just be the best one you've ever tasted. 
Unfortunately, the entres still seem to be a hit or miss...but the appetizers are more than worth every penny."}
{"text":"The service was pretty bad...considering the waitress disappeared for about 45 minutes when we were trying to get the bill. I think she was outside talking to friends. Other than that the food was quite good. I had the bombay chicken curry bowl and it was pretty damn nice."}
{"text":"This place freaks me out. I can't help but feel like it's a boozy barrier of sorts between tourists and the REAL food in the city. It's impossible to determine the original inspiration/influences for the food or the decor. It's like some terribly watered-down combination of pub-like, sports-bar-ish, family restauranty, whatever-ethnic-food-has-made-it-past-third-base-in-mass-appeal, over-sized American chain-ish eating/drinking place.  The decor is funny, but not funny \"ha ha\". It's random, almost desperate.

This is where you bring picky eaters who secretly want McDonalds but need to pretend they enjoy \"dining\" in a near semblance of adult sophistication - the menu may be large, but you can safely predict that everything will arrive at your table in that tried-and-true holy trinity of fat, salt, and sugar. Chances are high that you will eat to the point of discomfort because there is so much to distract your attention from the food itself. 

Sure, the waitstaff are eerily chirpy and perky, but they show up often enough to turn tables over at record speed. If you come here before a game, you definitely WILL need a reservation, and if you want to enjoy your meal, head elsewhere.  

With the virtual GPS in the Yelp app, there is really no need to ever eat at a place like this again out of desperation or ignorance -  rabid sports fan peer pressure is another matter entirely."}
{"text":"This place is ok. It's a mix of Baton Rouge and Cage Aux Sports. My girlfriend ordered chicken Alfredo with penne which was absolutely disgusting. I had the jalepeno hamburger and it was fantastic!! The spinach dip is always tasty as well and so is the lobster dip. I've also had the chicken fajitas and they were very tasty. It's the type of place you go to once in awhile. I don't go out of my way to grab a bite here."}
{"text":"honestly, it's not fantastic. For a place that serves up bar food, it was really disappointed. The burgers were average, the portions were small  and the staff were confused. There's nothing much else to say besides that. Next time I want a burger, I have a better chance of leaving happy if I went to Mc D's"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, everyone is really friendly especially waiting staff. Nachos where some of the best, fresh, salsa was made in house without a doubt. My problems arise around the poutine. I love poutine. This was a close interpretation of what we poutine gangstas call 'disco fries'. They where still good, but was not a poutine by a long shot. And by long shot I mean no shot at all. Gangs. Ps why was it so dark turn the lights on!"}
{"text":"Jack Astors is a cool bar and grill in Toronto. If I had to compare Jack Astors to something in America I would say it was a TGI Friday's on crack. The drinks are absolutely amazing the customer service was excellent. I love the atmosphere and the roof top is amazing. Originally we went on a Tuesday night it was super chill not too busy we went back on Friday night it was super busy. Jack Astors seems like it's a pretty cool place and it's quite popular. 

If you ever decide to go and you like Sangria you want to get the big sangria with red wine it's amazing and looks beautiful the Tiki drinks are also good and sweet I tried the bikini tiki drink jacked up with a extra shot. The food here is very creative but not the best bar food I have ever had that's why I'm not giving them a five stay rating. All in all I recommend them to anyone especially this specific location. This waitress name Alicia helped me and was very nice and friend. When I return to Toronto I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I went to this Jack Astor's recently for lunch on a weekday, let's just say I won't be back. Here's why:
1. The service was really bad. \"Guys\" was definitely the word on the brain and coming out of the mouth of everyone working in the place who spoke to us...which is fine if you're not dining with a female of the 50+ persuasion. (Admittedly, she's not the standard clientele of any Jack Astor's, but come on.) A waitress trying to identify with a customer who orders a vegetarian meal by claiming she's vegetarian as well, \"except for once or twice a year when I have bacon\", well, 'nuff said. Drinks were never offered a refill, except for a cup of coffee that was offered a refill about 5-10 after emptied a first time. And offer me an alternative to fries when they're listed on the menu...but more on that below.
2. The food also sucked. I know a veggie burger isn't supposed to be wonderful anywhere, but it was the fries that really lacked oomph. Previously frozen, double fried, and sitting in the friolator for way too long = not deserving to sit on a plate with a gourmet burger (the burger was actually quite nice).

With a plethora of other dining options in the area, I'll be going elsewhere in future."}
{"text":"Holy Smoke burger was rather bland and maybe even falling apart. Meh, right? Right, because it had almost no taste...
However, frankly it was not bad. The salad next to it was actually good. the single thin slice of pickle was sad though. Cost cutting much?
We had gone there for the patio and enjoying the sights and sound, but they really need to get some umbrellas. After a while, it was too hot. I am not able to see my food from the bright light.
The waiter was nice and polite and not forgetting things like water or extra sauce or extra napkins when we asked for them.
The hostess was friendly and looked the part. Cool.."}
{"text":"Great service and a fun place to get typical pub lunch food.  Started with some wings.  They talk up that they are made tableside but actually did not have enough sauce, otherwise they were good.  Also, a very tasty bacon cheeseburger and they did a very nice rendition of poutine."}
{"text":"I was on my own in Toronto as my wife left to Europe and there was a Jack Astor's right across the street from my hotel by the CN Tower.

I walked in and sat at the bar, tons of TVs lined the walls and I ordered an IPA. Yummy.

I ordered the veggie pizza with no cheese and watched life go on.

The pizza was perfect, LOVED it. Tons of toppings and I asked for some parm and red pepper flakes.

The servers shake your hand and ask your name. They were so cool, I wish every restaurant did this.

For a chain restaurant, the service was amazing and the food was great!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty generic, but they have a lovely patio space in the front and (mostly) reasonable drink prices. They were right around the corner from our hotel, and it was late enough that we didn't want to go too far and have to cab it back downtown if the subway stopped running.

It was easy to get a table outside, but it was not easy to get service at said table. I know we weren't eating dinner, but the place was empty on the inside, and there are only about 12 tables outside, so they were not very busy. I was originally interested in a sangria, but for some crazy reason, this was by far the most expensive sangria I have ever seen, anywhere- it was $25 for 8oz! We asked the waitress about this, and she just shrugged and told us that sangria is usually expensive. Okay, beer it is.

We all ordered different beers. We all received different beers from one another, but they definitely were not what we'd ordered. We spent the first 10 minutes passing them around, trying to see if the waitress had set them down wrong, but we ultimately determined that it seemed to be completely random. (Side note: we ordered very distinct beers, from an IPA, to a pilsner, to a brown ale, so it would have been easy to determine if we had an IPA on the table, but we definitely didn't).

We stayed for a second round, and told the waitress that last time, our drinks had been wrong. We ordered 2 at a time, thinking this would be harder to confuse. We still got a random selection, but the waitress didn't seem to care- she said she'd ask the bartender if the taps were switched, but we never heard anything.

If you go here and are particular about your beer, I recommend ordering anything in a bottle!

Free wifi for the check-in."}
{"text":"Upon entering this JA on NYE, I was greeted and asked how many people. I came here for a dinner date, and luckily there was no wait for 2! However, due to their fully booked reservations, we could only sit for 1.5hr. Our hostess led us to our table and provided menus before quickly scribbling our arrival time (they really wanted us out quick, eh?). I was busy playing Pokemon GO, which I should note that UNFORTUNATELY, the surrounding pokestops are just beyond reach of JA. I was trying to catch some pokemon though. So a few minutes later, our server Dylan arrives. Dylan asks how we are doing and if we are ready to order. I, who was so caught up on Pokemon, didn't even look at the menu yet, so I let my date order before me. I didn't want a big dinner. Dylan recommended some sort of chicken special but I ultimately went with Lobster and Crab Dip while date got Cheese Quesadilla (starters for dinner yay). Dylan noticed I was playing Pokemon GO and made some remarks to bond over Pokemon GO. We waited 10-15 minutes for our food. The Quesadilla was soooo goood. Hot and cheesy. The Dip was already a favourite of mine, and this location met my standards for the dish. Dylan passed by twice to make sure everything was okay. We had other plans that night so we ate until we were full (which meant we finished the quesadillas and half the dip) and then I flagged Dylan down for the bill. It came up to just under $33 after taxes. I recommend both dishes for anyone who loves cheese. Dylan was also a great server. This is definitely my new favourite JA location."}
{"text":"Meh. Typical trendy grill in the downtown Toronto area. There was nothing special about the food or drinks in anyway, except that they let you up the amount of alcohol for a little upcharge. Our server was a flighty 20-something that started telling us about how she was in the bathroom crying because a table walked out on her before even taking our drink orders. (TBH, I can see why they might have walked out on her, as she was a rare sight during OUR meal, and we waited abnormally long for OUR check.) She was very nice though and chatted us up.

The only standouts about Jack Astors is that they cover the tables with paper and give you crayons so you can draw all over them, (the waiters and waitresses come up and write their names upside down on the table) and they have shirts with funny little sayings on them. Other than that, its a totally forgettable experience. 

I will say though, if youre a young, single guy in Toronto, go into Jack Astors and ask to sit in Taras section. Youre welcome."}
{"text":"I've had both good and bad experiences at this location, but the good outweigh the bad. The food is always great, and the servers are generally pretty friendly and eager to please"}
{"text":"Waited 20 min to be served, restaurant was only half full with enough waters but took another 20 min to bring some dry barely eatable wings."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most happening spots for dinner in Pickering these days. With good reason too, Jack Astors consistently puts out decent food, has a great ambiance and has staff that are always exceptionally friendly and courteous.

There are two things for me that consistently put Jack Astors over the top. First the service is really, really good. Lindsay was helping us out during our visit. She was super friendly and really good at making us feel welcome. She was able to explain menu items and was always one step ahead with getting condiments, drinks, extra plates, etc without prompting. The second thing is that the food is very consistent. We shared the short board veggie nachos which were tasty and you didn't actually miss the meat with the generous amount of avocado on it. They aren't your average nachos as they come as individual chips topped with goodies. Some nacho purists might not like this but it's way easier to ensure toppings are evenly distributed and it's a little less messy. We also shared the local Pickering menu special fish and chips. The fish was a deliciously flaky and juicy white fish coated in crispy panko. It wasn't too greasy even with the french fries side. The coleslaw was a great complement to what was a heavily fried main. It was worth noting that there was only one piece of fish but it was pretty big.

The restaurant has a pretty fun ambiance overall. You're never out of line of sight of a TV which is usually playing some Just For Laughs reel or sports. There are crayons at every table and you can doodle on the table \"cloths\" while you wait for your food. The seating is usually pretty comfortable, especially in the booths. If you're ever looking for a casual meal in Pickering, this is is the spot to be!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, but not great. I had the Cheddar Beer soup, which wasn't gritty, which is usually the problem with it, and the Chicken Strips, which had a nice dipping sauce, but were only OK. I loved the pan bread, and the fries were very greasy, which was rough. 

The service was actually pretty awesome. It's a gimmick place, but the staff was very attentive to us and we felt very well cared-for."}
{"text":"Just save yourself the hassle and go to another location.

I came here with my Aunt and grandparents for dinner on Christmas Eve. We were actually trying to go to another restaurant around the area, but everything else was closed. 

Anyways, we ended up here and were seated right away. We ordered food in the first 15 minutes and then proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait...and then we noticed other people were also waiting--no food was coming out of the kitchen. We called over our waitress to see why it was taking almost an hour for our food (ahi tuna--that doesn't even get cooked, some sweet potato fries, and a chicken burger) to come out. She said she would check it out for us and let us know it was on its way.

So we continued to wait--against our better judgement--probably because there was no confirmed open restaurants anywhere around the area.

80 minutes after we had placed our order, the food finally came out and we ate. The food was beyond lackluster, but we did not even care because we had been starving since the moment we got there. We finished quickly, paid, and left--and the best part of it was that the waitress did not even acknowledge or apologize for the fact that we had to wait a really long time for bad food--expensive, bad food.

Needless to say, we will never be back to this location. Other locations have been much better, but there is something wrong with the way this one is operated."}
{"text":"Great food and great people IV bin there half a dozen times and had a good time every time. There food is great the people who work afternoon are amazing and the prices are reasonable, little expensive but it is a higher end place and the food was worth it especially the pan garlic bread always my favorite"}
{"text":"I never leave negative reviews on Yelp but felt that this time around, I had no choice but to! My girlfriends and I love to go to Jack Astor's for drinks and apps. However, we frequent other locations and not the North York one. It just so happens that two weeks ago and just last night as well, we went to the North York location for some food and drinks and both times, we experienced the worst customer service. Our server from two weeks ago was not attentive to us whatsoever and was much more busy attending to the tables filled with men, chatting them up for minutes at a time, when we were clearly waiting to be served or waiting for a simple glass of water. I believe that throughout the two hours we were there, our waiter approached us twice. We even had to hunt her down to pay for our bill! We ordered the bowtie pasta (with no chicken) and the pasta came with no sun-dried tomatoes. We asked for them to add it and our waiter brought us two plates of COLD sun-dried tomatoes (are you kidding me?) That warrants the bare minimum, tip wise!

Anyway, we thought this one time horrid experience was a fluke so we gave it another shot last night. Again, awful service. This time, our waiter was too busy chatting with her fellow employees, too busy to come around our table at all unless we hunted her down, yet again. I even took a picture of her standing in a corner chatting with her co-workers for an extended period of time, hoping to show it to the manager, but honestly, we won't be coming back here, so I didn't bother. However, I have attached the picture to this review for proof that the service at this location is just simply awful, awful, awful.

Jack Astors North York location, I believe you need to step up your customer service before word gets around that your staff is picky with who they serve well and who they do not.

Sincerely,

Disappointed patron(s)."}
{"text":"I've been eating Jack's my entire life, and it's one of my go to spots to catch an NBA game, or hang out with my friends at night. It's a great place to share a bunch of appetizers and drinks for couple hours. Servers usually check up on you once in a while, but never bother you too much.

The two times that I've been to this Jack's in downtown core, the experiences were consistent - slow. I've never been to another Jack's that's this slow in my life. It's packed, it's busy, but it wasn't to the point where we had to wait for almost an hour for the food. Our server was running around at one point, and disappearing for a long period of time. Back and forth, and it was difficult to ask for more water, or the bill. I do not recommend this Jack's, go to a different place or go to a different location."}
{"text":"Bar food/Family Restaurant.  The only thing I was really looking forward to was a decent meal.

I ordered the smoke salmon off their \"Cravourites\" menu and it was pretty good in all honesty.

The price tag was pretty hefty at $20 considering that you don't get a lot of food for it.  The atmosphere was good but a little dark if you sit inside and a little tight once the place fills up.

For a drink I ordered the \"five-o\" and that was my biggest mistake.  I thought it was one of their slush drinks because it was on the slush menu but I was sadly mistaken.  In addition all it tasted like was watered down lemon water.

Still, for a chain bar/restaurant the food was decent.  Just make sure you know what you're going to get when you order your drink.

{"text":"Big Jack Astor's on Yonge street. There is street parking nearby, you can also park in the private lots in the area. It will be a headache to park here if you come during prime hours.

One of the better Jack Astors. There is always someone at the front to get a server to take your party to a table. The service here is more attentive than many other Jack's in high volume locations. Server checks up on you occasionally and makes sure you have everything you need.

Food doesn't take long to arrive, and drinks will be on your table within 10 minutes of ordering. Very relaxed environment with dimmed lights and music playing. Jack's is one of my go to places to catch up with friends late at night, or watch a ball game."}
{"text":"Went to this jack Astros with my husband and 7 month old on a night we just didn't feel like cooking. The main restaurant area is great for families and the menu still makes us feel like we're out on a mini date night. 

We got to enjoy the grown up atmosphere with our baby without feeling like those parents who brought their baby into a bar. My husband got to watch his basketball game and I got adult talk with a glass of wine to boot! 

We love the chicken fingers here (random I know) but their always so juicy and crunchy.

We will be back on our next family date night."}
{"text":"Always a good spot for lunch or dinner. Fast, friendly and if you have any issue with a meal they insist on making it right.

Although I prefer family owned and unique spots, Jack Astor's has a winning recipe and I am rarely disappointed.

( One pet peeve however is that I was just told by my server that their pint glasses of beer are 18 ounces and they they try and upsize you for a fee to Jacks size... How about giving me an actual 20 oz pint in the first place?)"}
{"text":"Jack Astor's has horribly gone downhill, at least this one on Sources. I used to love ordering my chicken tenders dipped in mouthwatering sauce. Now the chicken tenders seems frozen. You can taste the blandness of it being defrosted. They also cut down on the sauce which makes it less appetizing. You can now also replace your fries with plain bazmati rice, i do not recommend this. It is microwavable rice that has no taste. It is not cheaper either to replace the fries with the rice. All in all, I will stay away for  abit until I see some improvement in the quality of their food."}

Deb ordered a Chick Magnet (a grilled fresh marinated chicken breast is topped with sliced hot house tomato, arugula, roasted red onions, roasted garlic lemon aioli and Goat cheese, and nestled on a toasted sweet potato bun) with a salad.  She said it was delicious and she'd order it again.

{"text":"I had four enrolment seminars to conduct in Brampton today.  I had headed out for lunch about 11:30am and went to Jack Astor's, which was a five minute drive away.

The hostess who greeted me was very friendly. After she seated me, she asked me if I wanted a newspaper. I had my book but thanked her.

A server came over right away and asked me what I wanted to drink ... I ordered a Diet Pepsi. She said that Rachelle would be my server.

Rachelle was very friendly and chatty. I ordered what I usually order when I'm at Jack Astor's ... Chicken Parmigiana (fresh chicken breast, lightly breaded and topped with smoked Mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce; served with bowtie pasta, tossed in a creamy cheese sauce).

I don't like parm cheese so asked that none be sprinkled on my pasta or the plate. When my meal arrived, there is was. But it was quickly fixed.

My meal was delicious!

Given the season, the restaurant was busy with what seemed to be holiday luncheons.

I ordered what I always order at Jack Astor's ... Chicken Parmigiana.  I really like it.  When it arrived, the cheese wasn't melted (it was really obvious) and when I stuck my finger in it, the chicken was stone cold.  Needless to say, I sent it back.  The chicken came back piping hot but the pasta was just warm.  It was tasty, though.

Even though there were a bunch of servers buzzing around, I found the service lacking.  After my meal was delivered, no one checked to see if I wanted a refill on my pop when my glass was empty or if I wanted dessert.  After waiting for a while, I had to ask for my bill.

I've been to some great Jack Astor's ... this one is definitely not one of them.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I drove home from London today and stopped at Jack Astor's for lunch before heading home.  I'd skipped breakfast so I was hungry.  I got there about 12:15pm and it was filling up for lunch.  There was a fun Friday vibe!

I ordered what I always order at a Jack Astor's ... Chicken Parmigiana.   The batter on the chicken was different than I've had at a Jack Astor's.  It was light and I really liked it.  I'm hoping it's throughout all the Jack Astor's as it made the Chicken Parm even better!  The tomato was chunky and good.  The cheese sauce on the pasta had a bit of a bite which I liked.  It's probably the best Chicken Parm I've had at a Jack Astor's.

Tamara was my server and she took good care of me."}
{"text":"I had a couple seminars to conduct this morning in Mississauga and had lunch afterwards at Jack Astor's.

I ordered my usual ... Chicken Parmigiana.  It was a while since I've had it and it was delicious!  The creamy cheese sauce had a bit of a bite which was fun.

Tina was my server.  She was friendly and took excellent care of me!"}
{"text":"No matter which Jack Astor i go to I am  always guaranteed the same quality of good food. We sat outside in their Patio for lunch. Had a chuckle when I noticed a bottle of sun screen....... Smart thinking. 
Enjoyed their chicken summer salad. Our waitress was simply  wonderful, very friendly and professional. Can't ask for more ...,. Well maybe I could ...... A free beer!

Just a little reality check for all us!!!
Enjoy,
Nadia

 lunch. I had a dici"}
{"text":"Not surprised it sucked, I really didn't want to come here but unfortunately it was in the area and open. 

Came here for drinks and nachos. 

Nachos were salty... Salty... And nothing fresh. It was CHEESE WHIZ. Like come on... 

We asked for guac which was $3 extra... To begin with our server didn't bring it, we had to ask her twice (she kept forgetting) , she brought it at the end of our stay when the nachos were OBVIOUSLY DONE .... And she still had the nerve to charge us. Not too mention the guac was maybe two tablespoons of smashed avocado. 

Our serve never checked on us. Awful experience over all. 

I gave it two stars because 
1) the girls at the front who were greeting us were super friendly and nice
2) I like the lollypops"}
{"text":"We were a party of 6 that came to dine at the Argentia location on Sunday for lunch. The food was okay, but what takes the cake was our service. Our server, Mel, seemed like she did not want to serve us. She was uninterested, did not smile and basically just a cold body taking down orders. She was the worst server I've ever had and I also work in Hospitality.

My husband ordered the Holy Smoke BBQ burger, but asked for some alterations. When he asked to make them, the waitress looked like she was about to quit on the spot. When our food arrived, we asked one of the servers for some hot sauce. We waited a while and
none was forth coming, so we ask another server for some hot sauce. Several minutes later, we ask again. This time we asked our server for hot sauce. We were all done our meals by the time the hot sauce arrived. I've never had to ask 3 times to 3 different wait staff for hot sauce before, especially when the restaurant was not even busy.

We were very disappointed with our experience."}
{"text":"What a joke!  Here on a Saturday night.  The restaurant is 20% full.  However, they can't seem to seat a table of 7.  There are 4 hostesses giggling and pointing behind the hostess station. How rude! Definitely not a place I would willingly to which I would willingly return!"}
{"text":"My favorite bar and grill! Great music, environment and bar food. 

I miss the dessert with the warm cookie with ice cream, bananas, strawberries, raspberry sauce, caramel, whipped cream and a cheery on top!!! Why would you remove that? WHY?! LOL"}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be one of my favorites but in this particular night i had a awful experience.  The service was was super slow. when we first arrived no one even attended us after we were seated for 30 like minutes. when we finally placed our order for the drinks our beers came out luke warm. The waiter was no wear to be found we had to always call him over to get ant kind of service. The food wasnt bad at all vut the service just ruined the night for me."}
{"text":"Great place to go while visiting Toronto. Patio was excellent. And the customer service is great. Unfortunately we weren't able to stay because they didn't allow pets. Although I must say the manager was able to handle it well in informing us. We came back to our hotel with our food and ate.  The food was delicious and flavorful. I would highly recommend coming and visiting this establishment.. Good for dates and group outings. I also would recommend getting the patio seats during the summer and fall.

I definitely will come back and visit again."}
{"text":"I used to be such a fan of Jack Astors but I've noticed a decline within the last year. I don't think the prices are bad at all and out of the chain restaurants, I have always preferred Jackastors over Moxies, Pickle Barrel and the like. 
This particular location has always had my heart because of the Elvis tribute booth, I've had dinner in that section once and it is certainly cozy. I've been to Jack's for countless group dinners and birthday dinners, it's got a fun atmosphere but it's definitely not a classy date-friendly spot imo. 
I was here on Tuesday night and there seemed to be some sort of event going on as music was loud as hell and there was a red carpet with closed off ropes leading to the patio. I was extremely confused because last time I checked, this was a dining establishment, not a club. I guess Jack Astors is trying to appeal to the 9-5 suburban 20-somethings who have weekday clubbing urges?
I noticed a change in the menu (once again) and I ordered some sort of poutine that was dry and did not live up to expectations. My friend's caesar salad wins worst dish of the night though, it was over 10 dollars and was even missing some of the ingredients the menu described. It had lettuce, croutons, dressing and nothing else.

Obligatory musing: 2 of the waitresses that night were literally half naked in a bra-like top bearing 3/4th of their stomach and the shortest shorts I have ever seen, and trust me, I'm not conservative either but that was just over-the-top. I guess this is what you get in Scarborough...anything for the tip I suppose. . . 
The only reason this review is two stars is from my previous meals at Jack's. I'll give it one more chance and then I'm walking away."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken fajita plate let's start with it took forever to get my our meals. The service was slow and our waitress was reluctant to give me a plate overall it was alright nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"The food is the same as every other Jack astors but the service is a win or lose. Some of the staff are absolutely amazing and other times you have to beg for service. You are often treated better if you are drinking a lot which can be unnerving."}
{"text":"Muy buena comida. Buenos platos al mediodía y menú para chicos a precio reducido 
Para el wifi hay que pedir un ticket
El servicio fue muy rápido. Recomendable"}
{"text":"Jack Astor's was not busy on a Friday night when I visited. The place was rather empty. One thing that stood out to me was the crayons and brown table cloths typical of a Montana's restaurant. I had to ask the waiter if they are owned by the same chain. Apparently they are not. 

I did like the tshirts worn by the staff. They had these clever little sayings on the back. Jack Astor's never disappoint with their overall aesthetic and atmosphere. Sports is always on.

I had the calamari as an appetizer. An average sized plate, it's battered and fried. It came with two sauces, a red tangy  one and a more cream like ranch style sauce with a slice of lemon. If you're into fried foods then definitely try this. I particularity did not find it too tasty. 

My main was their signature chicken finger and fries. It says on their menu that their chicken is raised without the use of steroids and grass fed which made me want to try them. I had medium spicy in buffalo sauce. Fries were good overall. I found the chicken to be juicy and very pleasing to the eyes. It was however, a little salty to my taste. It reminded me of the saltiness of tobasco. Nevertheless, it was good. 

Overall, I would visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Went for a late dinner for a family with young children. The restaurant was busy but the staff did a good job moving people through.  

Our pack of kids all ordered off the kids menu and really enjoyed their meals. 

My fiancée ordered the Tuna burger and loved it.  I had the shrimp pasta and it was okay but it was a fairly small portion for $18 and definitely could have done with a piece of garlic bread. 

The pasta was spicy but which might have been because I went with the pepper. Probably would have been perfect without the pepper."}
{"text":"General pub fare. You can't really go wrong with jack astors. The good and drink were affordable and good. They have a lot of variety and space. My only problem was that the service, pretty as it was, took a long time. We had to wait a really long time before we got out final drink. Actually, we probably would have kept drinking if we had quicker flow. They must have forgotten because it took more than 20 minutes. 

Anyways. Standard place. Standard service with one mental hiccup"}
{"text":"Friday night out with my date and we decided to come here! Great choice of appetizer and main course! We decided to try the Mucho Nachos with beef and Chicken Dippers. Wow the presentation was really great. We had an amazing time and the service impeccable! Thanks guys"}
{"text":"We went to Jack Astor for Sunday dinner. The restaurant is very large with two floors. I think they also have a patio.

On Sunday night, the restaurant was not crowded. The restaurant is nicely decorated, but it was strange to see the tables covered with paper. I never seen a restaurant use paper on their tables.

I ordered the seafood pasta dish. It was very good. My friend ordered a pasta dish and like it. The server was very nice and friendly.

Will we go back. Maybe because the food and service were very good."}
{"text":"One of the first times I went was a saturday night, and it was super busy.  Therefore, our waitress was pretty much nonexistent! The food was great, the regular pan bread was soo delicious! We waited a long time to pay the bill, but besides that, no issues. The time I went after that, there were no problems, it was a saturday about 5pm. I had the garlic pan loaf with cheese this time and it's the best garlic bread with cheese that I've ever had!! The food here is so good, I'll definitely be going here often."}
{"text":"Just called this place 4 times in a row they suppose to open at 11:30. It's already 11:40. This is ridiculous. Horrible service"}
{"text":"I don't remember Jack Astors being that bad. The food quality is horrible. I do know that all Jack Astors food comes in pre-packaged just like every other chain restaurant but their food has gotten much worse since the last time I went which was a few years ago."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with this place, ive tried a lot of things on the menu and they were all bommbb. Service is always on point even when busy."}
{"text":"This place is always great, really nice patio and good service.

Had some guacamole and chips for the app which wasnt that great.

But the Parmesan chicken bowtie pasta i had was amazing. Good seasoning on the chicken. Caesar salad was mehhhh"}
{"text":"Had a pretty decent dinner at Jack Astors, i got a burger that was pretty average and everyone else got steak that they enjoyed. The portions were very good which is normal for Jack Astors. Service is very good. The cheesy bread app is always good and filling! We always eat on the bar side to watch sports and it is one of the best places to watch big games."}
{"text":"Good value consistent quality always a good menu selection. Mexican salad fresh with great combo of ingredients and sharing plates great for groups."}
{"text":"I have been to several Jack Astors locations in the GTA and this is by far the WORST location to visit / being a party. I had my birthday here about 2 weeks ago: The service was incredibly slow (the restaurant was only half full), our servers never checked up on us (unless we flagged them down), water was never refilled (some people in our party didn't even receive water), cutlery was non-existant and dirty plates were never removed - my buddy had a plate of chicken wing bones sitting in front of him for over 3 hours (gross!). To top things off, the server(s) messed up our bills. People in our party had things on their bills that they never ordered. This would be understandable if we moved seats throughout the course of the night but we didn't. When we tried to explain the situation to our server she was extremely rude and replied by saying, \"that is why you check your bills\" (which is what we were doing...). I love JA (they have the most amazing chicken fingers) but PLEASE don't come here if you want good service. Go to the Front Street West location or any other location. 
Apart from the horrible service, the food is great (no complaints) and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick bite.  Ate at the bar and had a Guiness with the chipotle chicken pita.  Food was good and the service was spot on.  Didn't realize that it was a chain.  Wish we had one in Boston."}
{"text":"Typical Jack's food - which is ok, but not great.  It's the atmosphere that sets this location apart.  3 indoor floors and an amazing rooftop patio that rivals the best.  Easily the best Jack Astors I've been to."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with my kids. Noticed that the menu changed a bit. Tried the Wild Hog Pizza and it was amazing. My kids and I really enjoyed the Garlic Cheese Fries as an appetizer. They were delicious!"}
{"text":"Always packed, always noisy, completely disregarding any customer personality except for the one designed into the chain requirements. Friendly? Neutral.

Lots of funny little things like pencils to write on the paper table cloth. Female servers in mini-dresses. Male servers for some reason not wearing mini-dresses. Overall - fun, and strictly \"no strings attached\" atmosphere, great for those just around their 30-ish.

Check out their garlic bread - the greasiest in Toronto! Other food is unremarkable. Drinks are ok, better in pitchers."}
{"text":"Made the trek to Scarborough to meet up with a group of friends from this end of the city for drinks and a late dinner last week.  I arrived after 8 pm and my friends were seated in the bar area.   Every time I have come to this location, the large, casual bar area is busy and lively.   Many large tables with high stools and booths lining the walls.  

I ordered a glass of wine and the cheese burger but noticed the burger was served with \"melted American cheese\" according to the menu.  As such, I specifically asked the waitress if I could have my burger with cheddar.   The burger was a regular patty (not made fresh & in-house) and it was served with processed cheese, despite my request.  I didn't bother to send the burger back.  The side of sweet potato fries was fine. The \"new-menu\" Berry Rhubarb Cheesecake Trifle I had for dessert was actually ok; it had a nice home-style quality about it and people who do not like very sweet desserts should enjoy it. 

This appears to be a go-to spot for many local people in the area.  If in Scarborough, a decent spot to have a beer and watch sports on the several large screen tvs in the bar area.  Next time I will just drink though."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my brother and I can't complain at all. Service was amazing and the waiter was rather funny which made our night better. 

We shared nachos, and he ordered a burger and I ordered the chicken bowties. My brother said his burger was great. My bowties were amazing, but those never seem to disappoint at any jackastors. 

Overall great time and would go again"}
{"text":"I was surprised, the food is really good, big portions, very nice flavours and good combination. Outstanding fish & chips , well buttered and not oily. Bloody Caesar was good, well spiced , good ratio of vodka to juice. Kids meal of good portion. Service was fast and reliable. Welcoming stuff and nice decor. This is my second time here and i would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I warned in my previous rating that this place is always short staffed.  Today was no exception.   We arrived at the patio and despite it being half empty, we were told it was a 10-15 minute wait because the current server was \"too busy.\"  Despite the ridiculousness of this we put our name down and phone number since we were already there.  We sat there and waited, noticing people who came after us getting seated.  After four couples went through I asked why we weren't being seated.  She said \"we are just trying to catch up.\"  I asked if you catch up by seating your first guests last and she said \"oh I can find a table for you.\"  Horrible experience and downright awful.  Between servers that are \"too busy\" and hostesses that don't comprehend first come first serve, I've had it with this location."}
{"text":"Really nice and quiet compared to the Mississauga location. Our server was nice and friendly and even recommended some great food although I knew what I wanted before I walked in."}
{"text":"Mediocre ass food. 

The service.  Mmmm the service. 
We walk in on a Sunday evening. 7:10 and Noo hostess around. He comes out of upstairs and greets us before roaming around 2 extra minutes before we get seated.  

We waited until 7:51 for our food and by 8:10, we were done. That's how hungry we were. Our server man was NOO WHERE TO BE FOUND.  We ran out of water, had to raise our hands like highschool kids just to get their attention. 

By the time we were done, the experience wasn't worth it. Sucks considering I actually like JA's 

They also forgot the sauce on our cheesecake so that biatch was hella dry."}
{"text":"Everytime we come here for food, it's always packed so we make reservations. 

The food is okkaay. My boyfriend and I only come for chicken fingers and wings when we get cravings. The nachos are okay to. 

The only reason why I give to star is because of their service. Although the workers are friendly, the service is forever slow. I realize they may be busy with others, but it shouldn't take 40 minutes for a glass of water."}
{"text":"When we arrived there was one person waiting. I heard the hostess say there was a wait for the patio so I asked if we could go to the bar. She said sure. We passed a second host stand with 2 girls talking but neither acknowledged us so we went into the bar area and found a seat. Many servers and runners passed our table but no one stopped. Another group came in 4 or 5 and sat at a larger table adjacent ours and immediately we're approached by a server. The next server that came nearby, I asked if we could get service and she asked if we were seated. I said \"no, the hostess said we could go in the bar\". The server then turned and pointed at the bar and said \"that's the bar, this table you need to be seated at\". I said \"no one paid attention to us so we thought it was ok, since this table is in 'the bar area'.\" To which she was quick to inform me again that (pointing at the bar itself) \"that is the bar \". So I asked if she was going to serve us and she said \"ok...but next time get a hosts to seat you\". 

I didn't realize that the seats in Jack Astors were so precious. 

She took our drink order and I asked for the WiFi password - she said \"I'll print you one off \" and disappeared.  Someone different brought our drinks, and then she finally showed up to take our meal order. 

Again, a different person delivered our food and vanished before I could ask for anything else.  As you can see by the photo, the $16 plate of fish and a few chips seemed to have a vacancy.  That's all the fries. I guess the owner is trying to save money to get his car washed.  The girl did a table check and I asked for vinegar...white vinegar, but she brought both \"just in case\" as she said.

Very disappointed in the service, food portions and flavour.  No point in complaining since the didn't seem to care in the first place.

Finished drinks and the meal and even after watching a full inning of baseball and a trip to the washroom, I still had to stop a random server and ask for the bill.  Same girl dropped it off, but no one bothered to come back for the credit card...so I dropped a $50 bill in the folder and left...check out the pic of the bill...she's lucky I tipped at all.

Not the first time I've received poor treatment and sub par service and food here.  Cross this Jack Astors off my list...rather goto the one by North York Square instead - service there is 200% better"}
{"text":"A few days ago I met some friends who were in from out of town on the patio. I'm sure I previously mentioned my lack of love for chain restaurants. I still feel the same way, but our server Greg made it seem like we weren't just a bunch of lushes sitting on the patio. He was attentive without being intrusive, and was nice enough to update my friends on the hockey score anytime he could.
 
At the end of the night after we had settled he brought us a dessert to share, I'm not 100% sure how or if it wound up being free or if my companion ordered it and asked him to bring it and make up a story. I'm not asking questions regardless because it was delicious. 

They really should have happy hour specials, particularly because they are located in the ultra touristy Yonge and Dundas Square area. I guess it's not necessary because people frequent the restaurant regardless.

Bonus points for them having a seasonal and delicious Sam Adams on tap, it's nice that I had options aside from the standard. It was nearly $11 for a 20 oz pint which is mighty steep. 

Once again, I reiterate that the major thing this location of JA has going for them is the incredible patio, which overlooks the square, it's the only reason why I continue to suck it up and go there."}
{"text":"Food was great. Server was a bit too feisty. Wi-fi bonus! My wife said the burgers were one of the best she's had. Caesar salads were great too."}
{"text":"Yummy food but.... My pet peeve going to this location is the parking. With numerous restaurants around, it's difficult to find a spot during peak hours. I was surprised how packed it was on a weeknight....never mind weekend! 

The server/waitresses were polite.... however service was a tad slow.

Food was good and great place for catching up with friends whilst eating not too healthy food :)"}
{"text":"The other reviewers are correct. The staff were all very nice and always tried to go the extra mile. Our server Ryan (?) was friendly and really tried to bend over backwards for us. 

We sat in the bar area as hubby wanted to catch the nba playoffs. There was a hockey game playing on other tvs. Please note they do not show UFC events (hubby asked). While still eating our salad and appetizer, they served us the entree but then offered to keep them warm in the kitchen. However, when we got the burger it didn't seem warm at all,,,,. I was really hungry so did not ask them to reheat etc. The server was really nice and actually had a new burger made for my hubby (on the house). How nice! The burger took a while but what a diff when I tried his fries. It was so crispy ! Food was alright but service was definitely excellent. We will definitely be returning since it's in the area.

The patio is definitely going to be popular during the nice summer weather. There was even a TV up there!! Unfortunately it's first come first serve. So it may be a long wait. I noticed the crowd up there were mostly young 20s ppl and some were there purely there for scouting (eye rolls)."}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally go to a place like this, but it was late and I had a friend visiting from out of town. There surprisingly aren't many options around here to get real food after 10:30pm and we were both hungry.  It is extremely loud inside and outside, both because of the overly loud music and the people trying to talk over it...that's fine for a dance club but is bad for something set up more like a restaurant.  

The burgers my friend and I had were certainly edible, but actually neither of us made any comments about the food or drinks.  They were totally ignorable, but effective as feed to keep the hunger away.  

I would never recommend this place, but if somebody is around here looking for food this late I would offer it as one option I know of."}
{"text":"I always come back to jacks for their sauced up chicken fingers with sweet potato fries. I love it. 

This certain restaurant is typical JA and does nothing bad or special. I can't complain or praise. Everything came out on time and hot."}
{"text":"Jack Astor's is located MacLeod Trail in the SW.   It's can be hiding, depending on which way you're coming but it's near an Esso and Safeway!

Spence and I decided to hit up Jack Astor's one night after running around.  Since the last time we came here, they have done a bit of renovating.  The dining area seems more spacious!!  We got greeted and sat pretty much immediately.  Our server was pretty friendly, she was very attentive.  First, we ordered water and a milkshake each (Strawberry & Oreo).  It comes in a milkshake cup topped with whipped cream; they also give you all the extra on the side!! We started with the signature garlic pan bread.  Spence got the Indian butter chicken and I ordered the crispy honey sesame chicken.   The garlic bread was AH-MAZING, it was fresh, garlicy, buttery..all the goodness.  We dipped the bread into the extra butter that was in the pan, SO GOOD!! The butter chicken was sautéed in an aromatic butter sauce, served with basmati rice and Naan bread, Spence enjoyed it and the smell was pretty powerful but it was great!  My sesame chicken was lightly tossed in Thai honey sauce and came with carrots, snow peas, bean sprouts, green onions and red peppers, it was also served with jasmine rice.  We both enjoyed our meals and they definitely hit the spot!

Jack Astor's has menu with a wide selection and I'd definitely recommend this place whether you want to have a nice sit down meal or watch the game in the bar!"}
{"text":"Nice place, very good food, nice staff.

A waiter spilled an entire ice cream sundae on me once.

I would recommend it, it's a fine restaurant, just don't wear your best clothes there because apparently the wait staff has a bad grip. (lol)

But seriously, go, of all the Jack Astors I know of, this is a really nice location.

UPDATE: I'm being sent coupons for my incident, so obviously they're good people!"}
{"text":"Great go-to place for drinks!!  I'd always taken Jack Astor's as just a restaurant - a place to go grab food with groups of people.  I've been going there a lot lately just for drinks.  I love the atmosphere, and the staff is great!!  I won't lie, I also love drawing on tables with crayons.

The food's pretty good and the pricing's fair, so if you're feeling hungry, it's a good place to grab some grub too.  The bar's always busy.  If you're planning to go there to watch a game, make sure you give yourself time or you won't be getting a seat in there."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch with friends. I ordered an Asiago chicken pasta. Dh had the chicken nuggets for adults. Kids had diy taco and fish n chips. 

The Asiago chicken was burnt in parts. Total bummer. Otherwise this dish was good. Dh said the chicken was fried right and was yummy. 

Kids dishes are huge!  The taco came in a big bowl that you assemble yourself. 

Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Blackened salmon, more like burnt salmon. When asked to do over it was medium rare, had to take it to go to cook it myself."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  
We ordered the poutine, because everyone said we had to try it in Canada.  This was probably the wrong place to try it out.  The restaurant was listed as \"New Canadian\" so we had thought it might be a good place.  Nope.  Just a standard American-style sports bar with overpriced food and bad service.  Also ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with their soup of the day - beer and cheddar.  The soup was the best part of the meal .  

The worst part of the meal was sitting there forever with empty plates in front of us as server after server walked right by us without asking if we were done.  Eventually a manager noticed us sitting there, looking like we wanted to leave, and cleared our table before sending our waitress over with our check."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times now, and I usually enjoy the experience. I'm fond of the tongue in cheek decor and the exceedingly yummy bruschetta that's on the menu. 

The waiters and waitresses are usually prompt and friendly, though in all honesty, I suspect the time of evening that I go may have to do with that. 

The menu is diverse and offers a nice variety of meals. One of my favourites is the asiago chicken pasta, and my husband quite likes their steak offers, and of course, the bruschetta. 

It's quite the popular location, and with good reason."}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever had a bad meal at Jack's and if there ever was a problem they are very fast to remedy it with over compensation. I have been going to Jacks for years because I know it will always end well weather just an anniversary for 2 or a birthday party for 20. 

Just one thing... TURN THE BLOODY MUSIC DOWN! Just a hair or 2 on the dial. I can't hear my own thoughts let alone what the waitress or the people I'm sitting with are saying. ITS MADDENING!"}
{"text":"Nothing special a chain restaurant was not impressed but the chicken fingers is what I received . The waitress was great"}
{"text":"A typical bar joint. I only had some fries with soup. Not horrible or extremely outstanding, but okay enough to have over drinks. However their nachos dish is really yummmy. I love their fat sized drinks and the bar. Servers are always happy dappy, and overall environment chill. A neat place to come hit late at night"}
{"text":"Jack Astor's is pretty much the same anywhere you go. Pub/bar fare in a comfortable, sometimes rowdy setting. 
Visited this location after a Jays game. Was nearly empty. Perfection. 
Decided to order several apps. Here goes:
POUTINE: light gravy. A little dry. Lacking in the substance department. 
GARLIC PAN BREAD: a Jack's classic. Tip: must order blue cheese dip. 
WINGS: they were okay. I've had better at the Jack's Front and University location. 
LOBSTER/CRAB DIP: the shellfish seemed to be missing from this. A whole lot of cheese - which is great. But I'd like chunks of seafood if you're advertising a seafood dip. 
All in all, not bad. Service was great. Didn't take long to receive our order."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!!! I will never come back there again!!! Jackastors totally degraded themselves by taking a lot of things off the menu that i really enjoyed. Their menu is so dull. Highly NOT recommended unless you wana waste your money"}
{"text":"Burgers are terrible!! Jack Astors used to have amazing burgers years ago. Now they are small, sloppy and very cheap. Cook just piled on a massive chunk of cheap iceberg lettuce paired with a very sad looking patty. Oh and the lonely skinny limp pickle wedge on the side for garnish? Excellent service was the reason for a 2 star rating."}
{"text":"We were needing a quick bite and drinks before a Leafs game. The service was excellent. We ordered right away and had our food and drinks come out immediately Kendra was our server and she was awesome. The food is what you would expect from a Jack Astor's, nothing special but still satisfying"}
{"text":"Been going to jacks for awhile now for beers and some snacks, but today i had the luxury of having lunch. Menu seems to be nice and up to date i was actually surprise for a corporate chain to be in trend. So lets begin lunch...

I ordered the mac n cheese burger with a Mediterranean salad. My friend ordered guacamole and the veggie burger with fries. 
The guacamole was fresh and a little extra lime would have gone along way, the chips on the other hand are starting to turn stale. 
Veggie burger was decent in flavor, it was dry but we cant blame the soybeans ! 
Now to my mac n cheese burger. This was a joke, my 2 burger patties were burn char and so is this hard disk of pasta and some brown cheese. This was such a disaster. My burger was bland and dry, that i had to add ketchup and tabasco after, and the mac n cheese part was just not right. This failed in the mac n cheese burger category. 

Service was good and attentive"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday night, looking for a place near our hotel to just chill at.  Heard the music blaring from the upstairs and decided that this was the place we wanted to just chill.

It's inside a mall, on the 4th floor which is cool I guess.  We go in, are seated quickly.  We get our drink order in, and it comes.  But that's when it gets sad.  The waitress that brought our drinks seemed out of it, and didn't bring back the second order (a soda, which Canadians apparently only know as \"pop\" and 2 orders of food).  She never came back, and another waitress that was parading around helped us when the beers were low (she only asked if we wanted a refill).  

So, the random waitress was good, but not our waitress (whom we only saw once).  I gave it 3 stars because it was in a good location, the music was good, there was an eclectic mix of stuff on the tvs, and the people that went were good looking.  

There's also an outdoor seating area which is very nice.  Although there was a drunk couple dancing scandalously (which is good for some, bad for some)."}
{"text":"well let me start by saying... it's Jack Astors. you don't want to except the best, but you know your up for a great time.

This location was not too bad, the service was slow in the beginning in terms of our waitress getting to our table with drinks (it was packed due to the bluejay's do or die game---yay jays). She did not do the usual routine of introducing herself and writing her name backwards(applause for all jack's waiters' and waitress- this is definitely a skill), which is again not a big issue. She was a sweet, polite, just doing her job waitress. It took a really long time for our drinks to come, but our wait time for our food wasn't bad at all, I guess the bar was busy due to the game.

I don't stray to far from my ordinary choices when it comes to Jacks so late night I chose the Asiago Chicken bow tie pasta with sun dried tomatoes. you can never go wrong with this dish. My fiancé had the fish and chips which looked and smelled delish, I didn't try but he said it was pretty good. 

overall, I do not think I would visit this particular location again unless forced to by someone else, but I would still visit any other jack's."}
{"text":"Used to like this franchise. I haven't been in over two years and tonight, decided to go with friends; ordered appetizers and drinks. Wish I hadn't. The quality of food has gone downhill and their portions are pathetic! Calamari was a fraction of the amount they used to serve. Thought we were being fed their small sized version ($6 after 4pm daily).. but nope.. turns out we ate like birds at full price. Sweet potato fries and garlic bread were alright though nothing to write home about. Service wasn't the greatest either. Sat in the bar, which wasn't busy, yet tables weren't wiped down or cleared and we weren't attended to for at least 15 minutes. Luckily the alcohol blurred our experience. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"VIBE 
The two star is more for my bad date and less for the resto. Let's give the resto 2.5 stars. 
It's Jack Astor's. I don't know. What to expect other than rowdy under 25 year old birthday parties or get togethers with the guys? This was the date place when I was 20 (not this location obvs) but now it is in recent memory site of one of the most awkward dates of my life. When the date ends with him saying \"I just can't have one (beer),\" that's not good. But I picked the place on his taste, not mine. 

The bathroom has got to be in the most confusing place I've ever seen. Right beside the kitchen --it's basically a maze to get there and navigating around the front door area is not particularly easy. I wonder how many times someone has bumped into the glass doors. Labels people! 

That said, Will, our server was great. Super friendly and quick. BUT let me open the menu first before you ask me what I want and no need to say right away \"Want to Jack that up?\" I know you have to upsell but give me a minute! 

I DRANK 
The raspberry iced thingee. I can't even remember the name of it and it's not on their site. I was hoping the brain freeze would help get me through the date since noone was there to rescue me. It also helped that I couldn't gulp it down (I at least had to look polite). I used to like this drink ...at age 20. But yes, tastes have grown up and what did I ever think of ever drinking Smirnoff Iced vodka? Yuck! (and yes, I'm a snob). I was starving and had sweet potato fries. They were really tasty and a good price point ($4). 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
I was an \"ass\" (ast?) for going on this date. But live and learn. And don't drink Smirnoff Ice frozen (or at all)."}
{"text":"Was chilling and catching up with my friend and we decided to come here after shopping. I have never had their chicken fingers before and now I see why my friend loves it so much. The Server \"Heather\" was very nice and she took good care of us. We had a wonderful time and was never rushed and ask multiple times if we were doing ok or needed anything else. Heather, if you are reading this, no one will notice the broken or chipped nails you had; they will just remember the sincere and kindness you offered. Nice work and very much appreciated."}
{"text":"Started out as a pretty weak experience as I walked in the door and the 2 girls behind the hostess stand walked away. My wife was just behind me and told them we were meeting someone else seemed to throw them in to a tizzy 3 adults 1 child and a baby seat. I didn't find this so difficult, but the girl went running into the dining room. She reemerged to tell us they were getting our table ready. We could see many empty tables ready to go, but whatever. 
Several other people had come in by now and were asked about their numbers. The next group behind us was also a group of 5, again the girls head spun. She ran to the dining room and quickly reemerged this time and asked the group of 5 to follow her. I asked my wife to confirm that we were also a group of 5 and were there previous to the people being seated. The people behind them were also then seated prior to us. I hadn't realized what a chore I had given these young ladies. 
Finally the moment had come, we were asked to follow the hostess to our booth with a sling at the end for the baby seat. I really still have a hard time believing this took more than 2 minutes to set up, but had left us standing in the doorway for over 10. 
The menu was nothing special and dramatically over priced for what you get. $16 for pasta, really? I buy a bag of pasta for $1. I had fish and chips for $13, still reasonable considering the other options. Decent size, but as suspected it did have quite a bit of batter on it, I've seen worse though. The waitress was on the ball constantly refilling drinks without being asked and helpful with recommendations. 
The food was average, and the service was pretty good, but they definitely need a new hostess."}
{"text":"Went to this location for a bit of St. Patrick's day cheer. Because the weather was unusually warm, we actually sat on the patio, which became quickly crowded. A server promptly took our drink orders and served them soon after. I had an obligatory pint of Guinness but could not bring myself to order the \"Dublin Big Crunch Burger\"; it just didn't seem Irish (albeit, neither did the St. Patrick's Day Nachos). Instead, I had the Chipotle-Mango Rubbed Salmon. It was cooked right and nicely spiced and I might order it again. 

It seems that they have changed (upgraded?) the uniforms for the staff and have a hiring policy similar to Earl's and Joey which was a surprise to us. The patio looks like it might a great spot to spend a lazy summer afternoon (or a March one for that matter)."}
{"text":"There were no major games happening nor was there any good deal attracting guests to come. But still it took forever to be seated. And another life time before seeing our server taking our order. There had a lot or staff when I asked they said I had to talk to my server. 
My water came in this chipped cup. Since the place is so poorly lit, I didn't see it and drank out and cut my lips on it. I told this to OUR server and asked for a straw, she could not have cared less and I did not see this straw until the next time I saw her, which is when the bill came at the end of our meal ( 30 mins later). 

I will not be coming to this jack Astor's ever again. But if you are brave and still want to go, save your lips. Get straws!! And last tip, just don't go here."}
{"text":"Been coming to this jack Astor's for years. Always been a fan! 
I love their patio! Perfect for the summer. Staff always been friendly. Always loved their cheeky t-shirts. 
This location is always packed. If you can, call and make reservations. 
Parking might be a little challenging, try across the street in the square one lots."}
{"text":"I was out of the country for some time and my memory of Jack Astors was a quasi-Mexican place with paper table clothes that you could colour on. I was very surprised to learn that someone took my friend to a Jack Astor's, and that's when I found that Jack Astor's is actually quite a nice place. 

This place is particularly nice, actually. The food is pretty delicious (for a place like Jack Astor's) and the service is fantastic.The service has always been friendly and the waiters are actually very useful. Often times I ask people's recommendations and they don't really seem to care about the food or the restaurant. At this Jack Astor's the waiters have really tried the food and seem to like it, so their opinion is pretty detailed.

I was quite pleasantly surprised by this place and I think it's a great place to grab casual food before heading out in Toronto."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for this visit. 
We arrived around 5 and were seated immediately. By the time we left close to 7 there was a pretty big line of people waiting to be seated. We decided to forgo the entrees and just order apps. They do have gfree offerings in each section, offering gfree buns and pasta. The waiter also mentioned that most items can be made gfree. They also have a dedicated fryer (sort of) in that they only fry the fries in one particular fryer, so there is no cross contamination with chicken strips or anything breaded. We had the veggie nachos. The toppings were pretty disappointing. They were just sprinkled with diced tomatoes and green peppers. The amount of cheese was okay. Salsa and sour cream was provided but it was an extra $2.99 for guacamole (which was delish).
We also ordered the lettuce wraps (with grilled chicken instead of puffed quinoa - because it wasn't gfree), and sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were great. Perfectly cooked and nice and crispy. The lettuce wraps were good but had cilantro (gross). Wish I'd known before eating so I could have removed it. 
Overall the food was good, but the service was slow when it came to ordering and him coming back so we could pay. It wouldn't be my first choice to go here but I would visit again in general."}
{"text":"This is my second time for dinner at this restaurant. As we walked in there was really loud rap music playing over the speakers. Not exactly the type of music that should be playing at a sports bar. Or at least not as loud as it was being played. It made it hard to hear conversations within your own table.

We sat in the bar so that we could watch the baseball games that were playing. We asked our waiter if he could change one of the tv's to an additional game besides the Jays. The bar manager came over and nicely informed us that due to their tv package they only get one channel that plays baseball. No big deal. One is better than none! 

Do note that if you are looking for healthy food, this is NOT the place to go. They have salads (loaded with fattening dressing, bacon, fried chicken, etc), burgers, sandwiches, pizza, pasta, etc. On my first visit I ordered the chicken club sandwich. It was decent. Not amazing but definitely not horrible. This time I ordered the lettuce wraps. I was hoping for something lighter and a bit more healthy. Unfortunately they were not anywhere near healthy. The chicken was fried and the mixture was a thick saucy. But it tasted great!!!! I would definitely order this again. I know everyone at my table had food envy when they saw my lettuce wraps compared to theirs. Food prices were a bit high ($1-3) compared to the portion size. 

Overall the service was a 4, food was a 4, and the atmosphere (minus the music) was a 4. I would definitely return here again for dinner or game watching."}
{"text":"This Jack Astor's is fairly new and is located at the corner of Highway 2 and Glenanna Road, just outside the Pickering Town Centre. I came here twice in one week, once with a friend for snacks and another time with my boyfriend for dinner.

This particular Jacks is a bit smaller than most of the other ones I've been to but it still has the same look and feel, and the same menu. This particular location has a lot of windows, so when we came for dinner, it was really bright in the restaurant even though they had all the shades drawn.

When I came for a snack, my friend and I split the bruschetta and I had the Thai Lettuce wraps. Nothing to complain about, the food at Jacks is always good and neither dish disappointed. The bruschetta is a different take on classic bruschetta, with feta cheese and balsamic vinagrette on it, super tasty, definitely recommend this as a starter to share. When I came for dinner, we got pan bread to start (pan bread is always a must with dinner at Jack Astors) and the Chicken parm for dinner. The portion size was really good and everything was super tasty, came out hot and was really fresh. 

Both times, the service was good, nothing over the top or worthy of note here. Drinks were refilled in a timely manner and we didnt have any hangups getting our bill, paying or anything like that.

If you like Jack Astors and you're in the Pickering area, this is a good place to come especially now that you don't have to drive out to Scarborough or Oshawa to get some good Jacks! Beware that this place is SUPER busy most nights of the week (we went on a Sunday and it was fairly quiet, but most times I drive by, the lot is full and so is the patio since its summer) so you may have to wait."}
{"text":"We came to this particular Jack Astor's the night of the Hunger Games première but it wasn't that busy when we arrived. We were seated on the upper balcony of the patio, which gave us a pretty good view of the massive line to get into the HG movie opening night. Our party had three but only two of us had showed up so when our waitress took our drink order, we had planned to wait for our friend to show up before ordering.

First patio meal of the year required something alcoholic :P I had one of the frozen cocktails from the drink menu and it was pretty good. The portion size is pretty large and I'm willing to bet most of the alcohol got watered down from all the ice that was in the drink, but it was tasty nonetheless. A note with these drinks - the bartenders always fill the glasses up to the rim and the servers don't know how to put a drink down without spilling it. If you order something like this, get extra napkins and a wet nap or two if they have them.

I decided to deviate from my usual chicken fingers this time and went for the Lamb Kafta, which was a great choice. I haven't ever had anything bad from Jack Astor's but those damned chicken fingers are so good! Anyways, the lamb kafta plate doesn't look like it has a lot on it but its rather filling - I was just able to finish it and I was rather hungry! Beware that its definitely got a bit of a kick to it - I can handle some spice but these were almost too hot (deceivingly so!). 

The service this time wasn't exactly fantastic. Our waitress must have been in the weeds or oversat or perhaps just not on her game because she would disappear for long periods of time and when I did call her over to order for our friend who arrived late, she seemed annoyed. I normally quite like Jacks' but she put a damper on my enjoyment of my dinner and she was only really nice when she brought us the bill. I'm not a fan of waiters/waitresses who turn it on when its time for you to seriously consider their tip. While my experience wasn't fantastical, the food was pretty good so we'll be sure to come back again."}
{"text":"My coworkers took me here a few weeks ago on my last day of work before starting a new job. We had about 12 people altogether and they ended up seating us in the bar at high-ball tables. 

First of all, this wasn't ideal because the table was long and huge, so I couldn't talk to everyone that was there without moving around (and the waitress kept telling people to stop moving around because she had assigned seat numbers to sort out checks). Second of all, it was a Friday, so they had a live DJ that was playing music WAY too loud in the bar. My throat hurt later that night from having to yell just to hear the person beside me. Not conducive to a good eating experience. 

And then my coworkers ordered me a few shots. We did a porn star shot, which tasted nothing like it should have (considering this is my shot of choice at the bar) - too much blue curacao and it was almost watered down? Then they brought me a muff diver (a shot placed into a martini-style glass and covered with whipped cream, the idea that you have to go diving through the whipped cream to get to the tasty shot inside)... that you couldn't get the shot out of. I'm aware you're supposed to plunge your face into the glass to get the shot out, but after a few attempts, I ended up pulling the shot glass out just so I could take the shot. Furthermore, we put the shot glass back in, just as it had been (still with whipped cream in it too) and two other people tried to get the shot glass out and couldn't (at least I wasn't the only one with whipped cream on my face). I knew off the bat it wasn't going to work and I was right - their bartender needs to get their act together when making shots. 

They also should do something about a smoking section (albeit a small one) on the patio. My coworker and I went out for an after dinner smoke and ended up having to hover near the outdoors drink station in a corner to avoid hitting servers as they went by. The thing with this location is that its about three floors up, so going to ground level to smoke doesn't make any sense. 

Overall, the food was good as usual and the waitress was decent enough given that we were a huge party. I'd be happier if they'd seated us at regular tables or a booth though (when you have a diverse party of people not everyone is comfortable sitting at highballs) and they need to turn the music down during dinner hour (wow does that ever make me sound old). I'm out with friends, I want to listen to them, not a DJ who's spinning tunes like he's in a club when its 5:30 on a Friday."}
{"text":"Sadly, our most recent visit this evening will be the last time we ever go to Jack Astor's. We arrived at 6:25 and got our names on the list for a table indoors and were told it would be a 15 minute wait. It definitely took longer than than that for us to get a table but that was ok... 

It took our server forever to come to the table to greet us and offer drinks and it took even longer to get drinks. This was a trend that continued through the night. One of my friends was asking about some old menu items (and yes, complaining to the server, we know it's not her fault they changed the menu) and whether they were still available or could be made; sadly, they weren't. Our friend was upset but I couldn't blame her. All of our favourite menu items are gone: sauced up chicken fingers in honey garlic or the sweet chili, the garlic parmesan dipping sauce for fingers, shanghai lettuce wraps, the jasmine rice bowl... 

We didn't leave the restaurant until 8:40. That's over two hours for waiting on a table (20 mins) drinks, appetizers and mains. Waaaay too long. It took so long for our mains to come that I completely lost my appetite. 

I ordered the beer and cheese soup and a poutine. Soup was good, spicier than I remember, but the poutine felt sloppy. I ordered a \"beachy\" drink and it was so sweet, it was like drinking candy. The apps we had were good as usual, the cheese pan bread and bruschetta (although I feel like they sliced the bruschetta bread really thin compared to all the other times we've had it). 

Service was lacking; our server avoided our table and I could tell she knew we weren't happy but stayed away as a result. She was pleasant but she rarely came to the table, even when all the tables around us were empty. Someone else was bringing drinks and our food but that's just how they operate service. Took forever to get water. The longer the evening went on, the more unimpressed I became. 

The worst part was that the dining room was EMPTY. Almost all the tables near us were empty by the time we got our appetizers. So why the hell did our dinner service take TWO HOURS???? I know they had a busy patio but that doesn't add up if the dining room is empty. The most involved thing our table ordered was a steak. 

The menu has basically removed all the good old favourites in favor of new stuff that really didn't appeal to anyone at the table. The expos were the best people we dealt with. The two guys were happy when they came to the table and seemed genuinely happy to be bringing us food! In a plaza with so many good restaurants, you've gotta be better than that. 

Genuinely disappointing experience at what used to be a regular place for us. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Seeing as how most Jack Astor's are rather similar, I'm not going to talk at all about the decor or anything like that. This will be a pretty straightforward review.

I came here with a friend for dinner before we went to a movie and we had some serious time to kill. I called ahead to get us a table as I know this location can get super busy at the drop of a hat. We arrived a few minutes early but they sat us right away. Our waiter took a bit of time to come over but we were chatting about this and that, and needed some extra time with the menu, so it worked out well.

The main reason I wanted to write a review here is because the service was fantastic at this location. Our waiter's name was Brandon and he was just wonderful; he had a really good balance of knowing when to stop by and check up on us and knowing when to bugger off (which some waiters don't get). He brought us water refills when our drinks got low multiple times (without being asked to) and when we were done dinner, my friend and I were having a conversation and still picking at our food, and he didn't bother us to try and pack us up and get us out of the restaurant. In fact we were sitting there talking for at least half an hour and he had the good sense to leave us be. It wasn't that he was too busy, he just knew better. 

Way to go Brandon - keep it up man! You're awesome :)"}
{"text":"Horrible service. We could choke to death before they refilled our drinks. Do not recommend"}
{"text":"this location has a pretty cool, dark atmosphere. i tend to find jack Astors to not really be worth the big price tag.. I can find better and cheaper alternatives to pretty much anything on their menu.

I also wished they kept the smokey jacks burger because that was something unique at jack Astors that I would crave.

overall the meal will be decent and your service will be decent, and it's a pretty cool place so 3*!"}
{"text":"I want to thank Pepper the Bartender & Lindy the Manager for making this the most memorable Birthday. You both went far beyond expectations. It will be one of the many reasons I will return. The Grilled Salmon was exquisite. I'm usually very picky about my fish but this as well exceeded my expectations & the flavors danced on my tung. 

The atmosphere was warm and inviting. How ya'll ended up getting the whole bar to sing happy birthday to me is still mind boggling. Thank you once again. It's something I won't forget."}
{"text":"I went to this Jack Astor's location yesterday (March 14th) with a friend. It was very busy. We were seated at a very cramped table where I could barely move my chair to put my jacket over it. I usually go to Jack Astor's for their Asiago salad so I was so sad to see that it was missing from the menu. I asked the waiter and he said they no longer offer it. I was so disappointed. When our drinks came, we did not receive a straw. I was very surprised by this. So many changes since the last time I ate at Jack Astor's. The waiter (James Franco look a like) was very friendly and helpful. We didn't have our cutlery on the table which was annoying but other than that this waiter was great. I ordered the chicken fingers and fries which were okay but not what I had craved. I doubt I will ever return to this location. I did not enjoy the cramped seating, I felt very uncomfortable. Do not go to this restaurant when it is busy."}
{"text":"I have sent a letter to head office based on the discrimination I endured On January 15th. I was the only customer that was denied drinks, even though I was there with 3 other adults over a span of 3 hours and we had ordered food.  I was accused of not \"sharing\" my sangria when in fact I had given a glass to everyone (two to my brother) but my fiance as he hates white wine.  I had no idea that the Manager had sat down beside us through the night to watch every drink I drank.  Maybe I should ask her next time, if my \"pour\" is sufficient to her standards. 

I was also asked to pay the bill in advance because the manager felt I would be unable to pay the $155 bill.   My fiance and I are currently paying for our wedding where the cost per a person is more than doubled the bill that night.  This was a slap in the face.  I was the only one asked to pay my bill early and the only one to be denied drinks. I even spoke with the customers behind me because they heard what the waiter was saying and they said that was ridiculous.  

Maybe because of my ethnicity there was an underlying assumption about my ability to \"handle\" my liquor.  I also have my smartserve, so I know the policies, I've spoken to my friends who are servers and they have all agreed that the manager was out of line.  My fiance and his brother are Caucasian and they said they have NEVER experienced that type of treatment, while I can't say the same thing.  It's just shocking that I had to experience that in this establishment."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks on a Friday night. The lounge area was half empty by the time we went (10:45pm).

Service was 4*. 
We were served promptly with menus and the waitress gave us ample time to order. She also checked up on us frequently! 

Drinks were 3*
We got some drinks but I forgot the name. You can see the pictures as attached! The drinks were quite disappointing as they taste watered down. Not worth the price for sure.

Lobster Dip was 4*
In addition, we got a lobster dip which was really delicious - creamy and cheesy! I would definitely recommend the dip, paired with some alcohol!"}
{"text":"Located on the corner or Clark and Queen St... next to Tim Horton's drive thru.
Great friendly service.  Our server Marji was awesome.  

The booth seating does not leave much space.  I am not a big person and I have to say... its a tight fit.

There is a nice patio but the atmosphere is the busy parking lot and Queen St.

The bar is setup with a bunch of joined TV's.  Good for a sports event.

The food came out oretty quick and was very good.  I do think the portion was less than another Jack Astors I recently went to.

Parking is ample here."}
{"text":"My colleague suggested this place for iur meeting and glad he did.  I have not been to JA for a long time.  Love the chicken bow ties!  Portions are great.  
My colleague got a burger and substituted the fries for sweet potato fries.  Said it was really good.

Service was great!  Attentive server always checking to see if we needed anything.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Last time I was there my wife, son and I waited forever for someone to take our order. Then, the food (all of it) was either made incorrectly or ice cold. The place was not busy. They did a few things to try to resolve the issues but by this point, we had already been there for hours and just wanted to leave. They did apologize and remove SOME of the food from the bill. Still, I paid lots of money and left hungry and annoyed. If you ask me.... you want a beer while watching the game... this is your place. Want to eat with your family... go somewhere else."}
{"text":"So I went here on the afternoon with a few of my kids.  Got seated pretty quickly.  The place was pretty dark, i know its a bar and grill but it seemed to dark.

The menu was a mess and hard to read in the darkness.  I notice a lot of restaurants do that now, instead of organizing the menu, its a complete mess.

Food was hit or miss, steak was a tad small and not much to offer but came with mash potatoes.  The chicken was pretty good.  The pulled pork sandwich with fried onions was disappointing.  Kids menu was ok, the nuggets were good.  Best part of the dinner was the desert that came with the kids menu.

As I get older, service bothers me more and more cause I always give 15% regardless.  The waiter serving us wasn't very attentive.  When we were ready to order, he's no where to be seen.  When we wanted refills, he wasn't around.

The people around us had so much better waiters.  They kept checking in on them also the manager and GM kept on checking up on them.  

Overall, I would not go again, bad service is a no go for me."}
{"text":"We walked right up and get a table on the patio around 6pm on a Monday. There were five of us. I ordered the veggie burger with side salad. I enjoyed it! It seemed homemade, not a pre-made frozen patty. Everyone at the table seemed to enjoy their meal too. The server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Jack Astor's is a pretty good place to hang out and have a few beers.

The common area outside (to the right when you walk up) is good for people watching and provides a decent ambiance. The beer selection is solid, and while the wait staff is pushy about the 3oz. upgrades (only a dollar! wow!) it's actually a pretty good deal.

What about the food?

I had the lobster and crab dip, and I have to say, it's seriously one of the best dips I've ever had. Just the right amount of seafood and cheese, and serving it with both tortilla chips and pita triangles is pure genius.

They also had a pretty insane red velvet cake dessert, which took an extra day (and two more attempts) to fully consume."}
{"text":"Good bar food. Sports bar atmosphere. Try the  7oz steak topped with mushrooms with side of loaded mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"I like the ambience of this place. Friendly wait staff, they treated my 8 year old step daughter and her friend very nice. And the food was solid! Ihad a Philly Chess Steak sandwich with grilled onions while watching hockey on a nice big screen. I have noooo complaints about Jack Astor's in downtown Toronto. I'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with friends. The server was very good and attentive.
As for the food I had the club which I found it did not have allot of chicken. Overall I found the portions to be small with both the sandwich and fries but charged a hefty price for it. Overall it was just okay."}
{"text":"This high-quality chain restaurant was a regular party. The patio dining out front is a perfect option in the summertime, especially as people-watching options are rife along John Street and food is served late into the night. It was packed! The menu has a crazy variety so one could enjoy some Thai and Italian in the same sitting were one so inclined. I'll tell ya, I don't know what's in the balsamic glaze on the bruschetta, but that stuff rivaled Arby's in terms of inexplicably addictive sauces. Prices aren't particularly cheap, but quality food, service, and atmosphere made it worth the extra jingle."}
{"text":"144 Front Street West is a cockroach infested building. We work here and building management chooses to continually ignore it and will not call an exterminator. If you value sanitation I would not recommend eating at this jack Astors or any other restaurant located in this building."}
{"text":"So my wife and I decided to go to jack Astors for dinner. Upon arrival we were greated and seated quickly and waitress came within a minute. Considering it was St Patties day I was very surprised. We ordered a piña colada and a Caesar  and got them Jacked Up both were in way to small of a glass to be offering a double shot my wife's piña colada came in a martini glass instead of mixing and putting in a bigger glass they brought a straight shot of rum on the side (never got drunk) Ordered the artichoke and spinach dip it came with this little bow of the dip ( tasted good ) but a little small for the price of it in my option. I ordered the bourbon steak medium  was  over cooked to med well. The shrimp were cooked perfectly the southern tomato sauce the had with the steak was awesome. The wife had the chicken fingers she had no complains All in all dinner barely ok. Don't think I will going back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Food: 3/5
Service: 5/5
Good for sports: 3.5/5

We came here to watch the Jays ALDS Game 3 last week. We came early to get a table but by the time the game started, the place was packed! There are tons of TVs everywhere with the main screen up by the bar. My only complaint that it's 4 TVs combined into one so you get 4 borders for each screen - not seamless. 

We started with the lobster and crab dip which came with flat bread and tortilla chips. Can't really taste the lobster or crab but I'm sure it was in there. The dip is pretty tasty but I wish there was more of it, we had a lot of bread leftover.

I had the 7oz South American ($22.72) - top sirloin steak topped with sun dried tomato and garlic chimichurri sauce with stacked fries in the same sauce topped with feta cheese and parsley. The steak was cooked well and flavourful (I didn't need steak sauce). They give you a TON of fries but unfortunately, they were pretty soggy.

Finished the night off with their Macho Nachos ($6 special for half order that night) - chips layered with tomatoes, peppers, onion, jalapenos, three cheeses, and beef chili. Pretty decent size for a half order. The chili is pretty salty though, drowned out the nachos a bit. Shouldn't really complain though, too much chili is a usually a good thing. 

Our server was great, she was on point all night."}
{"text":"Get the smiling buddha salad. You will not regret this. Sub goat cheese for feta and life is amazing."}
{"text":"The best thing I can say is that after a Jays game with some comic expo going on across the street, we were seated quickly.

Usually I enjoy Jack Astors, having eaten at quite a few of their locations in Ontario, but the experience at this location was very disappointing.

It was an unusually hot day and the restaurant was almost as warm and humid as it was outside.  I would expect the air conditioning would be turned up on a day such as this.  In addition the music was unnecessarily loud for 4pm and just generally terrible. Maybe I'm too old but I had to yell at anyone in my group so they could hear me. We ended up just eating in silence and got out as soon as possible.  The combination of the loud music and humid, warm environment made us decide to skip drinks and just eat and go. 

Service speed was ok and the server was fine but the food seemed like it was rushed and just slapped together.  Not as good as it usually is based on my previous experience at other locations.

Given the number and variety of restaurants around here I am sorry I visited this Jack Astors based on my previous experience with the chain."}
{"text":"Best location in Toronto. Jack Astors offers a fun noisy TV crazy environment with interesting but always tasty food options. Try the pan bread with cheese yum!"}
{"text":"Jacks in general 5 stars. This location, 3 stars..a few too many bad experiences here such as water dripping from the ceiling into my food...gross. Also this location is smaller. I recommend the Don Mills location, best one in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Always good and reliable !! Was there for lunch today and pleased as usual.  Their chicken tenders, pizza and burgers are amazing!"}
{"text":"Always excellent service here.  The sauced up chicken fingers are my go-to faves and the burgers are always delicious. Food is well priced, but the drinks are quite expensive. The friendly staff and short wait time keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Well looky here. Obviously their recruiting department knows what talent to chase. A safe place to eat. A typical gimmick joint. Very expensive to have drinks there. It's fine to go to. Would never go out of my way to stop here but would not oppose if this is where the crew wanted to go. Meh....."}
{"text":"Great place. We had the nachos and it was really good! Staff is super nice and friendly. Definitely would come back if i'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good chicken fingers!  The chicken well-brined and obviously breaded and fried in-house.  The fries also tasted fresh but were still crispy (double fried).  Decent beer selection as well.  Solid spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite and a drink before catching a flight back to YVR, very impressed with their customer service - John (our waiter) and Jeevan (the manager). Food was tasty, drinks were good, and we'd definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Went to this Jack Astors for the first time last night. Ended hanging out there all night after getting bombed with the guys sitting next to us at the bar. 
Beers tend to be a little pricier here than most other places, only about 50 cents to a dollar more per drink. Beer selection wasn't great but I ended up drinking steam whistle all night anyway. Food was good, I had a chicken sandwich with goat cheese and a side salad. No complaints.
I like the bathrooms here because they're big and generally clean...downstairs in case you were wondering. 
Bartenders were all nice and attentive, we had Alicia most of the time and she's adorable. 
The place is huge and there's tons of TVs showing different games which was nice because that actually had the WBC on a few TVs and not the Raptors game on every tv in the house."}
{"text":"Haven't been in years... They've become fine dining prices and portion sizes... But wtf, I didn't come for that.  small portion of fries 15? 5 chicken \"fingers\" that were the size of my sons fingers. They were good, but just tiny... Kids meal was good and always fun to draw on the table... But won't be back for another year"}
{"text":"1255pm entered, wasn't asked dining or bar. Just brought to the back of the bar. 115 tired of waiting...  Taylor was ok last time. But I guess they can't handle a lunch rush."}
{"text":"We were on our way down town and decided to stop by to get some good quality food without the down town price. Never been at this location before but I've been to the franchise many a time. I have to say, they did a great job making us happy. The staff was friendly, the food was great and in abundance. We ordered too much and had to take it home as leftovers because we were expecting less. 

If you are in the area and are looking for a slightly up scale place to eat. This is a great place."}
{"text":"Great place to kick back and relax before or after a movie. The food is good, not amazing but good. There is always a lot of seating around the bar area so if you don't have a reservation, you can still get a quick seat. Staff are friendly but don't really go out of their way. 

Nothing too special, just a nice place to go for a bite."}
{"text":"Went there when it was quite and the staff was very nice and the food was very good. I could not figure out which beer to try so they actually gave me two small glasses with different beers to try out before I picked one. Nice touch. That alone will make me come back again."}
{"text":"We've been going to this location of Jack Astor's since they opened many years ago. It's always been pretty good, if a little loud.

We hadn't been in probably a year when we decided to go back about 2 months or so ago. We were thrilled to see they now offer gluten-free buns with their burgers, so that's what we ordered.

The burgers were all tasty, cooked well and the buns weren't too bad. Most places have gluten-free buns that don't stand up well to burgers and tend to fall apart about halfway through the meal as they get a little wet and these are pretty much the same. I'd say they're about middle of the road when it comes to holding up to a burger, not the worst but not the best either.

The chicken curry, served with naan and roasted cauliflower (all comes in a shallow bowl) was surprisingly good albeit not very spicy.

On the last couple of visits, my husband has ordered the steak frites and has thoroughly enjoyed it and the red wine jus with which it's served.

The service is hit and miss. We've had really friendly, attentive servers on most of our visits, but we've also had the odd one who obviously doesn't really want to be there. This past weekend our server was extremely friendly and attentive and when I mentioned I'd like the Italian burger if only it didn't have goat cheese, she offered to sub. it for any other cheese they have. She also chatted with us for about a minute or so every single time she came to our table.

As I mentioned before, the restaurant is extremely loud which is fine with me but not everyone enjoys that atmosphere when they're eating. There are lots of screens all over the restaurant and bar showing pretty much every imaginable sport.

The bathrooms are always clean and fairly tidy and the atmosphere is fun an welcoming. I'm sure we'll be going back again soon."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the wings were not the best considering they're not like most of the chicken wings I've had from other restaurants and the blond female manager working there is a bitch! A couple of minutes before my visit came to an end, I was talking to three female customers from Kingston, Ontario because one of them smilingly waved @ me, so I thought I introduced myself. I was texting myself a reminder of something important when this manager came up to me. She told me to come see her and said not to take pictures of them. I wasn't and even proved it to her, but she still bossed me around about the topic with a smile on her face. I was just going to say \"good bye\" to them and the manager kinda treated me like some sort of pervert. I left feeling awkward and embarrassed, so I don't think I will come back. If friends invited me over there? Maybe! I mean it has a great view from the outdoor patio. Though, for now, I'm staying away from this place!"}
{"text":"This place was great! I definitely love the staff and the environment is very fun. Come see Dan - also he's bilingual if someone needs Spanish Assistance. Great food and even better atmosphere from 2 Flight Attendants :)"}
{"text":"I have a negative experience to share.
The guacamole order was completely forgotten by the waiter, The calamari appetizer for extremely disappointing  - very tiny slices of calamari covered with huge layer of flour coating. And the final - new salad from the future menu didn't have an avocado. Our waitress don't even know to apologize. I visited other location before , this one is a big disappointment!"}
{"text":"So I am taking 10 minutes out of my day to write this review. I just recently moved back to Toronto after living in NYC for three years and was so excited to come back to some of the familiar neighborhood spots in downtown Toronto. Most exciting for me was renewing my loyalties to the raptors! So last night me and two friends decided to go and watch the game at jack astors at yonge and dundas. To say the service we received was horrendous will be an understatement! I gave them two stars because the bar tender we ordered drinks from was the only decent server in the whole place. We had to wait at the bar for our table and decided to order a pitcher there. Once our table was ready, we walked over and asked the hostess if it was possible to have the volume up on the tv since we were there to watch the game after all. She said she would ask the manager and get back to us. We went to sit at our table and waited but no one showed up with an answer or even ask to if we needed to order anything else. After 15 mins we flagged down a waitress who was walking by and asked if the volume could be turned up for the game and her answer \"no we only do that for Leafs games\" uhmm? Ok. So I guess that's that. Toronto bars only favor hockey not basketball? Anyhow, we still decide to watch the game with no volume. In the 40 mins we sat at the table, no one approached us to ask if everything was ok or if we needed anything else. So we decided to leave at half time. Even then, while putting our jackets on no one came to settle our bill with us. We walked to the bar to ask the bartender and he said oh you don't have to pay me, one of the wait staff should have come to you guys. So there we were standing around and wondering if we should just walk out anyway. But instead we asked to speak to the manager who mumbled a few incoherent words and offered us coupons! We do not want coupons... We wanted to let him know that service at his bar sucks! And that we would like to settle our bill. He said its ok don't worry about the three beers we will cover it! How condescending! Anyway we walked out and ended up having the best time and greatest service at the shark club just one floor below. And you know what, we only ordered three ciders and a pound of wings but the waitress treated us like we were eating $100 meal. At the end of the day it's all about how you're treated. Needless to say we will NOT Be returning to jack astors! My once favorite bar before I moved away. But I guess things change"}
{"text":"I tried Jack Astor for the first time with a friend for dinner on a Wednesday night, while the place was pretty busy they still managed to seat us without an issue (Their location is huge and they have so much seating inside and some outdoor).  We chose to sit on the restaurant side since it was quieter than the bar section. The decor inside is very rustic and casual , but very comfortable and cozy , you can even draw on the table as it is covered with brown paper and they supply you with crayons! (Great for groups and very family friendly).  Service was impeccable all around , everyone was so friendly and efficient , we were not kept waiting long for anything! Our beers were nice and cold and really hit the spot. The food was pretty good , we got crispy chicken sandwich with fries. The chicken was well cooked and ingredients were fresh but they put wayyyyy too much sauce in there so it becomes all that you can taste. The fries were very good , perfectly cooked and had some spices on them that gave them a nice flavor , their spicy mayo was good as well. Good place for a casual meal with decent food that wont break the bank!"}
{"text":"Food was great.  Service is best.  Nice bar and family style restaurant.  We went there on Saturday and restaurant was packed but manager found us a table for 2.  Kirsten was our server and was great.  Will b back soon."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Jack Astor's and it was up to my standard Sports Bar & Grill expectations. The weather was nice and we decided to sit out on the patio, the only downside to this was that there was a horde of Yellowjackets whizzing around the tables. I ordered the white wine sangria (which was delicious by the way) and the odors of the drink kept attracting the Yellowjackets to our table.

Beside the local bee attraction, I ordered  a roast beef sandwich served with au jous and poutine. The sandwich had onion baked in the bread, but it wasn't an overwhelming flavor. The poutine, of course was delicious.

The atmosphere was fun and casual and I would go again to Jack Astor's to get drinks or just to grab lunch, but would probably sit inside this time."}
{"text":"Once again I can never seem to get excited about franchised restaurant concepts, and like others before Jack Astors, the Queensway location just did not have the wow factor. My friend and I shared a pound of dry coated wings and regular nachos. The wings were plump and very tasty but the same could not be said for the nachos. The cheese on our nachos almost tasted like Cheese Whiz, any who loves nachos knows that the best cheese on a nacho is well done and not creamy. Our server was great and the beer selection was like any other similar place. Pricing was also on par with everyone else. Not a great dining experience but not bad, I probably wont be back here, or any other Jack Astors for a while..."}
{"text":"My wife and I finished watching a movie at Yonge and Dundas and it was raining so we decided to go back in and sit on jack astors patio over looking dundas sq.  We ended up staying for two drinks and ordered the pepperoni and mushroom pizza. The crust was perfectly crisp and the garlic tomato sauce was very good. We had very low expectations, a place to get out of the rain and have a drink with a nice view. The service was excellent. We are in our early 50s and it was a very young crowd, including the servers as we expected. We didn't feel out of place at all and really enjoyed the young vibe. Did I say great service???  Well done."}
{"text":"The chicken wings are HALAL! I went there in the service was good. No issues.
The garlic bread didn't seem well cooked enough inside so they gave me another one no charge.
We ate em all!!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner before Jays game. Ordered few dishes including chicken wings. Service was good. Wings came out undercooked. They told us it's the blood vessels but almost all the wings were bloody."}
{"text":"Beer tap wasn't working and some food items aren't available. How can you run out of food by 2 pm on a Saturday. Very slow service. Had to ask several times to get water and cutleries."}
{"text":"Was here yesterday for a birthday lunch. Our server, Adrian, handled our large and demanding group very well. He was a attentive and good humored young man, which I'm sure serves him well during those busy services. 

The food was consistent with what I have come to expect from Jack Astors overall. Everyone seemed very pleased with their meals."}
{"text":"Dont get why this place doesnt get a better review. My burger was really great! It was the roadhouse BBQ one. It was a good size, on the smaller side, but flavorful. I enjoyed the greek side salad I ordered along side it, and it had lots of toppings inside to enjoy. We ordered a sweet potato fries that was good too. The location itself looks fresh and clean on the inside, and it was kind of loud but thats okay. Those fishbowl drinks were huge!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service everytime we go! Only one mistake ever in the amount of times we've been there. The waitress forgot to order our Macho Nachos (which is a must have btw) but made it up with a free $17 appetizer voucher for our next time in! Love the atmosphere and the Memphis steak is to die for but Dammmn those burgers are great as well!"}
{"text":"Received great service from our server Andrew (Drew) & the food came out pretty quickly for a busy Saturday night (which is great). Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Patio makes it a 4 star. Great patio and view on a summer day with mist and shade on the rooftop. I like their new drink menu but since they changed their food menu, I haven't been a fan. So it's usual if opt out of food and just settle for drinks."}
{"text":"Food here was average. We ordered the Chicken BLT poutine, the Con Carne tacos and the honey garlic chicken wings. 

The wings were my favourite since it was pretty crispy and well seasoned. 


I felt that something was missing from the dish. The tacos could have been better if served with a side of dipping sauce. It was also very oily, as the oil seeped through the taco shell. In addition, the dish contained too many vegetables for my liking.

The BLT poutine was stacked in a Jenga-like fashion, and was very fun to eat. I thought that the coolness of the lettuce cut through a lot of the grease associated with the dish and gave it a nice balance. This was my favourite dish of the night. 

I absolutely love the service here and highly commend their attentiveness. This bar is great for watching live sports and is a wonderful place to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"FOOD - 3/5
The food here is just typical menu items you would find in any other bar. They have tons of dishes you can share with friends as well as a wide selection of mains. I think food here is overpriced for a lot of their mains. We got nachos and calamari to share which were decently priced. The nachos were okay, while the calamari wasn't my favourite.

SERVICE - 4/5
The staff here were really friendly and accommodating. It was, however, hard at times to flag our server down. They should really improve on that aspect.

OVERALL - 4/5
It's a really great place to meet up with friends however the food is just regular bar food."}
{"text":"Beer is good, everything else needs work. Guacamole has garlic in it, yak. Artichoke-spinach deep has very little of both artichoke and spinach, all it has is cream, cream and more cream, processed cream that is. The service is slow, the place is packed to the roof.
I'll leave this place to the parents of new born babies that miss the hype of going out so they bring babies to beer establishments with them, or perhaps it's just a part of the early childhood development strategy."}
{"text":"Is this a chain restaurant? Yes.

Is this in the tourist trap central of Toronto? Yes.

Do I wish there is a third question I could ask, which would emphasize the point you wouldn't think it be good to go here? Yes. 

But guess what? It's not that bad if you're a visiting tourist. 



The outdoor patio is the way to go. Unless you go during the cold months, which is often. So basically you probably shouldn't. However if you are lucky enough to be in Toronto on a nice Summer's day the outdoor patio is where it's at. A great view of Dundas Square giving you an idea of what it's like. 

The restaurant itself is a Canadian badass version of an American chain like Applebees or Fridays. They have a huge selection of beer. Waiters wear shirts with witty and racy jokes. And the food is much better than the American chains. Lobster dip? Yes please.

So if you're visiting and you want to get a feel for Dundas. Hit up Jack Astor's. Much better than the Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"This chain restaurant is pretty much like what we expected with good dining environment and friendly service. It is a slightly pricy comparing to the same type of food but not too much off the chart. The real catch here is the outdoor patio and the servers. Great on a sunny day to relax and people watch or just have a relaxing conversation. The servers are great, friendly, nice and always there to help! 

Actually 3 stars for food and 4 stars on good service and location."}
{"text":"Nice food presentation, but very tasteless. Slow service. Have to beg to get drinks."}
{"text":"It's pronounced Jack As-tours. ;) Nice restaurant - good service, solid chicken and pasta, loud ambience but not too loud."}
{"text":"The thought of the food here makes me a little queasy. The food never tastes fresh and I really haven't enjoyed my experiences there. Overall, I don't think I will go back"}
{"text":"I visited this place with a group of friends and I had a nice time with them. Its the time which matters when you are with your friends. Jack Astor's is pretty much same wherever you go. But it was the first time I tried their cocktail in Jack Astor's and I simply loved it. I tried three cocktails and all of them were just awesome. It had a sweet and tangy taste with cranberry flavor. 

Price- Little expensive

Ambience- Good

Food- Good

Service- Nice"}
{"text":"After I had a poor experience at a Jack Astor's in London I was pretty hesitant to return.  This restaurant was HUGE, and really busy.  It was going to be a 45 minute wait for the dining room so we opted to sit at the bar, which unfortunately is why my review is only 4 stars.  The wait staff kind of forgot about us and it was crazy noisy.

The food was awesome (this was the issue with my London visit).  The nachos here have always been my fave, but on this particular day they were even better.  There was SO much chili on them we had to eat it with a fork.  It was perfect.

My burger was delicious.  Cooked to perfection, the bun wasn't soggy and the flavor was fantastic.  All in all a great visit."}
{"text":"My wife and I used to go often as we enjoyed certain items. Apple pie, Spring Rolls, steak and baked potatoes . Really nice deserts. The salads used to be nice. Gone are the pie, rolls,baked potatoes.now it's just a common bar and taking most things off the menu. We will probable eat further out as the menu is more expensive with smaller portions.

We returned last night for the last time. 
We found they have also taken off the Steak Fajitas, Beef Dip and Salmon. 
We went over the menu for 20 minutes with the poor waitress as there was nothing left we liked to order. I settled for the Chicken Wings that were good but I would have gone to Swiss Chalet forChicken or Mammas pizza for Pizza.
Even the deserts are minimal. Cookies ?
Well , It's Joeys. If we can get in."}
{"text":"Jack's automatically gets 3 stars because they are consistent. No matter what location I go to my old faithful's taste the same. I always order bruschetta to start because surprisingly Jack Astor's makes the best bruschetta to ever grace my taste buds. It is described as: Roma tomatoes, red onions, roasted garlic and fresh basil topped with Feta and Parmesan-Romano cheeses and drizzled with roasted garlic lemon aioli and a balsamic glaze. Absolute PERFECCCCTIIIOOOONN! They are not stingy with ingredients and they load those bad boys up with bruschetta toppings half way through I always regret sharing. For my main I go with the Chicken bowtie pasta and I substituted sundried tomatoes with fresh tomatoes and mushrooms. My server recommended extra sauce which was an excellent idea and I will continue to do that.

So I'm guessing you are wondering why they didn't get 5 stars if I LOVED my food so much. Simply put the service. I don't know if they were understaffed or not properly trained but it was lacking. My waiter was very friendly BUT he didn't bring us an adequate amount of plates and cutlery and we couldn't find him so I stole them off another table, he was too hard to find most of the time, he left in a hurry without topping off my meal with black pepper and parmesan we didn't end up finding him again till almost half way through our meal, I believe he forgot to input on of our appetizers because it came a little too long after the others, he forgot to bring my friends beer with the round and then we ended up ordering it again from another waiter and when we asked for the bill we saw him walking about tending to other table for too long before he came back to ours. We had to ask for EVERYTHING he did not anticipate our needs once."}
{"text":"I'm usually one to explore menus but when it comes to jack Astors I always stick to my old faithful chicken bow tie pasta! I substitute sun dried tomatoes for fresh tomatoes and mushroom and it never fails. Jack Astors also has one of the best bruschettas I've ever had (surprisingly) it is full of flavour! Dices tomatoes, red onions, garlic, feta cheese and a balsamic drizzle. Divine! I don't eat there often so I probably won't branch out and try other items on the menu, not much pops out at me. Jacks really needs an amazing dessert like how moxies has a white chocolate brownie (the only reason I go there)."}
{"text":"Long gone are the days where you'd eat peanut shells and throw them onto the floor.  They still have the brown paper on the tables with crayons though!  Today's Jack Astor's is at a distant from the 'nutty' mess and medicore bar food of yesterday ... or is it?  I received a $10 off of $30 coupon to entice me to try their new menu.  With a fellow officemate, I headed here for lunch and see if there was anything great on the new menu.

I arrived and this location has the look and feel of a normal sports bar except with dimmer lighting.  The restaurant is split into two parts: a fairly big bar area that has over 15 TV screens and a seated dining area that has maybe... 10 smaller screens.  All of them are on sports channels so I know their target audience isn't me... that clue was reinforced by the skimpy waitress and hostess outfits that befits the Moxie's chain next to them.  I get that attractive waitstaff makes for a better environment but it's November... in Canada... could you not put your waitstaff in more than a pair of black short shorts and slightly see through black t-shirts?    

We arrived shortly after 12 pm and left less than 50 minutes later... so this restaurant is completely appropriate for a business lunch if you're wanting casual bar food.  The menu is definitely bigger and more diverse than before.  Pad Thai, fajitas, pizzas, stir fries, and entree salads join the usual deep fried bar foods that I remember.  Poutines and steaks are now added to the menu pages as well.  I order a Smiling Buddha salad and my friend orders a burger with a diet coke.  The wait staff here is smiling and they're pleasant.  Orders are taken quickly and our particular waitress is very accomodating with my dairy restrictions and tweaks the salad.

Both lunch entrees arrive within 10 minutes of ordering and they're decent sized.  Compared to other restaurants (like Union Social), the fries portion is definitely smaller and they're not as crispy or well salted.  My salad isn't bad but it's not as good as Sprouts or Union Social either.  The chicken breast is real chicken but you can tell it has that slightly processed watered texture.  It's not completely gummy but it has that pre-frozen texture.    The quinoa, dried cranberries, apricots, apples, and pears are all good.  Nothing is overly dried or old.  It's all nicely soft textured and taste like real food.  Apples are sweet, strawberries taste like strawberries instead of white bland fruit, and pears have a nice crisp texture.  The greens are all fresh too.. nothing wilted here.  My only complaint would be the chicken breast.. not great.  As for the burger, I got an 'ok but not great' mention from my friend.  He took out the huge chunk of onion they put in it.  I'm not joking when I say there was a 1/4 inch full slab of onion... not an onion ring but the entire slab of onion.  As for service, it was pleasant and quick but it gets a bit downgraded as they forgot to refill my friend's diet coke after being asked.  

Lunch came out to over $30 before the coupon... is it worth the $30 ++?  I say no.  Union Social and Sprouts are far better options and tastier as well at a lower (or similar price).  That being said, I wouldn't be opposed to coming here for a group lunch as it has decent selection and quick and pleasant service... provided someone else is paying!"}

Order: SEÑOR JACK'S JALAPEÑO BURGER 

It was not as spicy but more of a sweet tangy flavour due to the jalapeno zucchini relish (yum!). I do wish they had more chili hot sauce though. I love sweet/spicy stuff. However, the burger itself was quite dry as you kept digging it. And there was a handful of shredded lettuce (way too much).  I ordered a house salad w/greek dressing for the side which usually comes with mixed greens, but this had mostly romaine lettuce. (Eh..) The portion was big though! BUT, I only came here because I had a coupon ($4.97 for ANY burger) or else it'd be $13.71. (Yikes!) 

ALSO, this place would be ideal for kids and groups of teens 'cause the tables are like Montana's where you can draw with crayons. 

Overall: This burger is worth the coupon price. Okay, maybe like $8.50 with the big salad, but definately NOT the almost 14 dollars."}
{"text":"Loved this place. We sat outside and they have a little heated patio with a nice view of the street so you can people watch. We were on the upper level of the outdoor section and it seemed like we had our own little area, very nice. The menu was a bit overwhelming. There's just SO much to choose from (ribs, burgers, pad thai, seafood, steaks, fajitas, sandwiches, appetizers, wings, so much more) so it was really hard to choose. Everything sounded amazing.

The Sangria was delicious but not very strong. The waitress was okay. They messed up my friend's order. I had the quesedilla as an appetizer which was pretty good. The corn smothered in bacon and cheese and butter was OK, not as good as I expected. The burger was pretty good. My friend, who's a vegan, really liked her Pad Thai. I loved how clean the bathroom is. I also like how they had free wifi. I wish they had these down by me in Maryland. Great place for dinner and drinks with friends."}
{"text":"We, party of 4, came here for dinner and we all wanted to site in the patio. Great place to catch things up with friends and family. 

Our server Martin was very attentive and asked if we needed drinks when it was emptied on the table. Didn't take too long for him to get us drinks. 

We ordered 2x Non-alcohol and Cheese Soup, 2x Caesar Salad with Bacon, Smoked Salmon, Veg Out Pizza, Curry Bowl, and the Classic 10oz Medium Rare Steak.

My guests can't get enough of the soup, delicious, creamy and not too spicy. A fantastic dish to start. Salmon was a little dry but it was pretty good, says one of my guest. My other guests really enjoyed her Pizza, vegetables and the olives were all fresh. My wife loved the Curry Bowl, a great touch to add a few Naan in the bowl. The cherry tomatoes goes very nicely with the curry. My steak was cooked perfectly. I asked for medium rare and that is what I got, it was spot on. Mash Potatoes was alright, nothing to brag about but would been nice if there was gravy. I really enjoy my steak though. 

We really had a great time at this restaurant. The patio we got was a great spot. Great dinner!!!

{"text":"My wife and I came here for lunch. It was a beautiful day today!  We wanted to enjoy the weather and this is a good place to enjoy it!  The hostess got us table for two at the patio. Today was a good day!!!

Our server (forgot her name) was awesome!  Brought our drinks fast like a coyote. Drinking Corona and enjoying the weather at the patio is an amazing experience. It was super busy at around 12 pm. Even when it gets busy our server is always checking up on us and clearing empty bottles and plates. Love her service!!!

I order the classic poutine and the classic 10 oz steak - medium rare with market vegetables on the side. I love how they presented the poutine. Very neat. Taste is delicious!  Fries is crisp, cheese curds is real and the gravy is super tasty. The 10 oz steak - medium rare is on point. $31 is totally worth it!  Even I can't grill a steak that good. Juicy, tender, and delicious - melts in your mouth. Thumbs up to the chef!

My wife and I chilled here for 2 hrs. We really enjoy this place. When we left, my wife said we have to come here again. Agreed!

{"text":"The only decent rooftop patio in the area.  Food and drinks are not bad.  They could use more staff though."}
{"text":"More like a 3,5 stars. We stopped by here before hoping into my Porter flight. On this night, it was very busy due to the Toronto Maple Leafs game that night. We waited 20 minutes typical for any Jack Astor's. We chose Pad Thai and a bowtie chicken fetuccini with a glass of Merlot Jackson  Triggs. Our dessert was a caramel cheese cake dressed in dough rolls. The Good: It is cradled near CN Tower, Air Canada Center, Union subway station and other attractions like Ripley's Aquarium. The Bad:   The Ugly: it was busy so we couldn't order our meal 15 minutes in after we were shown our table and after a 20 minute wait to just get a table. Oh well. We were hungry, so we didn't complain. Tip: Don't go on hockey or basketball game night. $$-$$$"}
{"text":"Wow this was a nice treat after visiting the Mirabel Premium Outlet North of Montreal. It was full around dinner time.Situated in Laval's Centris Mall near other Fab eateries, La Cordée, Cineplex and iFly.

The place was cavernous, modern, and well lit. For those who love sports, they have several multiscreen TV's, but there are plenty of tables away from them to have group or even initiate dinners.

One disappoinment was there wasn't a lot of choices. They had a one sided big menu!

They do have specials like Sangria half price for particular days in the week and Happy hour. 

On our visit, there was a huge group whose celebrant was getting her 50th...very lovely. The waitresses were knowledgeable and helpful almost too apologetic at times...We got our usual red wine Redwood from Cali. The 8oz was pretty pricey. Although they are known for their burgers we had a craving  for pasta! Something different you can order their chicken wings in a hot pot.  There are three flavors to choose from. They mix the sauce onto the wings infront of you shaking the pot. A lot if pateons got this. I managed to catch the big college bgame between Kansas vs Duke so this was a bonus. $$-$$$"}
{"text":"jack astors is like the everyday ontario restaurant. came here tonight to meet up with a couple of friends. they love the fajitas here, but i came for the booze :P
packed as always, i don't think i have ever been 2 a jack astors that has been empty
since it was so packed the waitress didn't show up as much as need at our table, but overall, it was ok
good atmosphere, nothing special tho"}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Saturday night with my two sisters. This plaza is always busy on Saturdays and it takes a bit to get a parking spot. I called ahead to put our name down (they don't take reservations Saturday evening) and while I found a parking spot my sisters were seated in less than 10 minutes.  The menu changes a lot here, in terms of severing sizes and presentation. Everything was very tasty, would just change the serving sizes to be a tad bit bigger. 
We ordered 2 beer & cheddar soups and a coleslaw salad to start. The soup was super cute as there was a shot of beer to pour into the soup before eating. For mains we ordered, the curry bowl, Buddha salad and the chicken parmesan. The starters were the perfect size hit the main meals could have been a bit bigger for the price. Will return again :)"}
{"text":"This location recently did some updates to their location. Back in the day, if you go to the dining area you can relax and draw on the tables and has a more family friendly birthday foodie vibe. The bar was center stage with a couple pool tables and can be very busy on  a friday or saturday night.

Since their update (which they are still in the middle of) they kept that feel with an upgrade. The dining area has a more polished feel with the same vibe. The bar area has been totally redeveloped to have a big screen made up of many little ones. A decent DJ and patio, lots of beer, and opened up and extended the bar to where it used to have a parties only area.

Food is enjoyable, usually the wings (seasame garlic something flavour) or the burgers are my go-tos. But usually the food is pretty good.

The place is good for a birthday, or to be out on the town in scarborough if you dont feel like going downtown. For scarborough folks, you will probably bump into someone you know."}
{"text":"This is a a cool JA. Went there for a date since she was coming from the west. Met her mid-way. 

The staff at the front were very friendly and helpful. I told them my date was running late, so they sat a few other people first but asked me prior. Moment she arrived, we probably waited a minute since they were prepared.

Once we sat down, the waitress was friendly. I forget her name... but then again... I sometimes forget my own.

I got a couple beers and nachos. I think the only think that was missed for the night was a water that I asked for before I left. But it was a busy night.

Definitely hit this one up if you're around the area."}
{"text":"I made reservations on a Saturday for 10 people a week in advance. They called me the day before to confirm and I said yes. This was supposed to be a surprise party for my sister, however when her friends showed up to be seated they were told there was no reservation. I told them they ruined the surprise party that I had planned for my sister. I was given an apology and told that they would prioritize us first for a table. 

  Since we were a big group, gratuity was included. Waitress did not make that much of an effort. Had to be told multiple times to refill our waters and bring an empty container for left overs. Yes it was extremely busy that day with around 5 or more birthdays but that does not justify having such shitty service. Especially since I ended up paying around 70 for the 3 of us. I ordered nachos to share with my brother and sister and the sour cream was frozen. The food overall wasn't that great. 

  I was a big fan of this place and location till I experienced this kind of treatment. I spent a whole month planning this surprise party and to have it ruined and on top of that receive shitty service has left a bad taste in my mouth. I do not plan on returning to this location."}
{"text":"The ginger chicken wings were amazing, the blood orange sangria was really good, also our server Nikita was great."}
{"text":"This place is a staple for me for meeting up with friends for lunch or even going here for lunch with work. I really enjoy this atmosphere at this place. Its got a sports bar type of feel, and the staff have great personalities. They are always cheerful and treat you like a friend rather than your servant. I have come to enjoy this place more because their service is really good for large groups. Last time I went with work there was a party of about 15 and all the meals came out hot and all within a couple of minutes of each other.

Their patio has become much better over time. Although it is situated on University (so there isn't much to look at other than traffic), they put up pretty high glass walls to block out some of the traffic noise. They have an actual bar on the patio which is great for those out there to still sit at a bar and people watch and can get their drinks fast.

Every time I go here I get the exact same thing; buffalo chicken fingers. They used to have my favourite chicken fingers until Baton Rouge took over. I enjoy them so much because they sauce them up quite a bit (medium is pretty hot IMO) and they also give you a nice ranch dressing for dipping. The combination is mind blowing.

Although I am quite boring in my dish selection, my wife has tried some different items. She has become a huge fan of the prime rib burger (she says its the best around), and just recently on their seasonal menu, she has really enjoyed the greek salad with watermelon. Sounds like a terrible combination, I know, but don't knock it until you try it.

There are two things I don't like about it. One is that for it being a pseudo sports bar, they need to upgrade their tv's to the new 16:9 world, and secondly, it can get really noisy in there, and there is nothing in the design of the building to dampen it."}
{"text":"Good American place to watch the game and look at the nice-looking waitresses when eating your BBQ ribs (and you will need to use teeth and eat like a savage to enjoy your ribs - BBQ ribs are just OK, clearly not the best in town); steaks are ridiculously small and over cooked (it seems that medium = overcooked here). Burgers are... burgers like everywhere else than the usual burger fast-food brands. 
Beers and nachos with chedars or bruschettas seem to be the most sure things to order here, for you to fully enjoy the place with friends. You'll eat later (at home or on the way back home, in a Mc's drive in or swhere else)."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for a late lunch.  My wife and I split some nachos and wings and our daughter had the kids pasta with tomato sauce.  The nachos were good and cheesy - they used queso and shredded cheese to make sure they were ooey gooey.  The one thing I would have liked is jalapenos on the nachos, but that's just a personal preference.  

The wings were also very good - good size and the sauce had a nice flavor and kick.  They did this flaire thing where they tossed the wings in the sauce at the table.  This was a little unnecessary and just seemed downright awkward.  I'd rather have my wings sauced in the kitchen.  

My daughter didn't really like her kids pasta - the tomato sauce was too spicy for her.  We decided to send it back; that's right my 2 year sent her first meal back (she's gonna be yelp elite in no time).  Our server, Chris was very understanding and happy to switch the tomato sauce pasta for a butter sauce pasta which my daughter very much enjoyed.  

Overall the food is good and the staff are very friendly.  I would recommend coming and would definitely come back if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Wait time for seating was approximately 20 minutes, and for food approximately 10 minutes. They provided a paper tablecloth and crayons for us to doodle on the table with - this is a pretty sweet idea to appease eaters while they wait for their food. I ordered the \"Open Sesame Salmon Salad\". I'm one to save the best part of the dish (salmon) for last. After finishing all the greens, I tackled the Salmon. Little did I know, that the salmon was completely raw. I didn't notice right away because of the soy glaze it was covered in. I was expecting a firm, fully cooked salmon, as it's pretty unusual for a western eatery to serve Sashimi - especially in  a salad, covered in sauce. I asked the waitress whether or not the salmon dish was meant to be raw - she said \"No! Absolutely not\".. I'm not sure how the kitchen managed to let this slip by, but kudos to the kind waitress for offering to waive the bill. However, I most likely won't be going back."}
{"text":"You can't really go wrong going to Jack Astor's on a lunch or evening outing. This location especially is really busy and chances are you'll have to wait a bit to get a seat.

Nothing here is bad, but don't expect to be wow'ed either. There isn't much variation in terms of their menu items and I don't often see new things to try out, despite them changing the way the menu looks several times in the past 3 years.

The servers here are generally polite. Depending on who you get, you may have servers that occasionally check in on you, and some that come quite often. It really comes down to the time of day and how busy they are. No complaints so far though!

One thing I come here often for though is their Chicken Tenders. Now, you might be asking me: \"Really? Chicken Tenders? Come on...\" But honestly, they're probably one of the few places that serves pretty good chicken tenders. They're crispy, juicy, and really hot once it arrives to your table. I've had tenders at a lot of places, and some of them dried out on me before I even took my first bite.

As for the other menu items, they're alright - you can find slight variations of them at different chains much similar to Jack Astor's.

Good, consistent food and good service gives this place a 3.5 stars for me. I can only really see chain restaurants like Jack Astor's getting a better review if their service improves or they actually have the guts to put something wilder, while staying delicious, on their menu."}
{"text":"Sitting here now on the patio now, sat for 15 minutes without being served. No excuses when the place is dead. Decided to just leave instead. Terrible absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're a vegetarian. I ordered the bow ties without chicken thinking I'd still get the sun dried tomatoes and all the other ingredients listed in the description but I literally got white pasta with no sauce and some Parmesan. I was In Disbelief and the worst part is, tip was included on the bill even though service sucked and was so delayed. Emphasizing this again, avoid this place"}
{"text":"The food is good, but not super impressive; plus it's a little more pricey than I'd consider worth it. It's a good place to go with a group. Please be nice to your waitresses, it's their job to wear the sexist uniform and that doesn't mean they want you to stare at their thighs. They make their wait staff wear shirts that are supposed to be cool, but just come off as obnoxious. 

I was having a bad day and got a shot in my milkshake once. Our waitress nodded and gave me half off. At least you know the staff is nice."}
{"text":"Not sure what's up with the chain restaurants in 10 Dundas Street East, as this is the 2nd place in the building now where servers acted almost as if I should feel \"grateful\" just to be allowed to eat there. I'm not a fan of those super trendy joints which actually do elicit this kind of reaction from customers, but Jack Astor's definitely NOT one of those places. 

Here's a tip for any aspiring servers: Customers pay you to order what THEY want when they are ready (if it's available of course), not what and when is convenient for YOU.

The Lowdown:

Although this happened on a Friday night out on the busy outdoor patio, sometimes customers still need more than a minute or two to decide on orders despite the push to keep the flow of traffic moving. After telling our server Alex that I needed more time to look over the drink menu, he proceeds to take my friend's orders anyway, then stand there waiting (instead of offering to come back, like the majority of servers would politely do). Unbelievably, I STILL wasn't ready to order a whole 7 seconds later (whaaat??)

After my buddy jokingly ordered a drink for me, and I literally said \"what? what is that? I don't want that,\" the server jots down the order anyway and walks away. Literally a minute later, I get over my shock over what just happened, and I flag Alex down to tell him what I actually WANTED to order. \"The order's already been put in\" says Aussie Dude Bro waiter unapologetically. \"The order's already been put in\" he says again after I ask if he can change it.

I understand it's not great etiquette to ask to return an item after it's arrived at the table (even though many restaurants with good customer service would do so anyway), but I was merely asking this guy to change an order (before it arrived) that I didn't even order myself. My buddy, being the people-pleasing guy he is, offers to drink both drinks so Aussie Dude Bro waiter doesn't have to take a minute to actually do his job correctly. 

The block of baked garlic fries I ordered here was decent enough, and one of the few non-overpriced items on a menu filled with very typical bar/pub fare. As mentioned by other reviewers, the best thing about this place is the outdoor patio that overlooks Dundas Square. For tourists, and others who haven't seen this sight before, it might be worth your while to have a drink here...but only if you remember to THANK your Jack Astor's server for the amaaazing privilege of dining here!

Will I be back? No, not if I can help it."}
{"text":"We went as a family of three, 2 adults and 1 toddler. The space is GREAT if you have kids. The service is GREAT. The crayons, the attention to cutlery for little people, the massive piece of paper used as table cloth is GREAT, you don't feel bad when your kid scribbles and spills everywhere . Space and service wise, this place gets a 4/5 from me, -1 for a so so convenient bathroom. Food wise..... It's OK. I ordered a burger with brie, side of salad. My hubby had a veggie pizza and my toddler had the kids meal for building her own taco. I shouldve asked if the salsa was going to be spicy because it was. They should use non spicy salsa for kids. The ingredients were all mediocre. Nothing I couldn't have picked up cheaply from Maxi and thrown together quickly. My burger meat was good but the brie, the 'caramelized mushroom and onions' topping barely there. The side salad was iceberg lettuce with some other veggies.... Again, not top notch ingredients. My hubby wasn't too impressed with the pizza, he found the crust too doughy and the sauce salty. All in all, I would still come here because of the convenience of the space when you have a kid but with low expectations for food quality. Our plates were also not too expensive but our ginger ales were 3.65$ each and watered down!!!!! Not cool."}
{"text":"The TVs aren't as plentiful at this Jack Astors, when compare to the Dudas Square location one.  Also, I don't remember the food being as good."}
{"text":"Jack Astors has a lot of TV's and good food.

It's a good venue for catching a sports game, although it can get crowded.  Jack Astors is a chain.  I have been to their other one on John St, which isn't as crowded and has a different set up."}

Tiny pieces of tuna and hardly any lettuce??! 
Def will never order that again"}
{"text":"Haven't been to this place since a long time, people are really nice the team is great bilut honestly the new menu is not the best. I ordered the salmon dish and it is flavor less. I wish they didn't change the menu they had a good one before."}
{"text":"I love Jack Astor's.  Ever since they redesigned them, the bar has looked so sleek and sexy.  The restaurant is always popping.  This place is where it's at for consistent good food and service.  I support this chain whole heartedly.  They all deserve 4's and 5's!!

{"text":"I went here with a group of friends and we had to wait for around 20 minutes for a table. We got seated in a booth which was a plus. I got their poutine with chicken in it and it was good and I like how they had refills for the soda of you buy it. One of my friends ordered a Sprite but it tasted more frizzy then sprite, which meant that they were running out of the syrup for the Sprite. We thought it was a mistake but then waitress brought back the drink with the same drink so she got another drink instead. Overall, good place to eat with friends although I find it a bit too loud and dark. They do have a really nice patio outside that provides outdoor heating and a nice view of Yonge-Dundas"}
{"text":"The food was a hit this time unlike last time I was here. Although the salad could improve a bit. The croutons in the Caesar salad were huge and since you can't really cut croutons I didn't eat them. The Pad Thai with shrimps was excellent. The calamari, although greesy, was very tasty. If you become a vVVIP member you get a $10 discount. The service was much better this time, maybe because we were seated inside and not in the patio."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and every time, our servers somehow disappear. 

Came here tonight for a late meal. Food was ok. Service was absolutely terrible. Our server was Kara. She left our table for like 20 minutes. No refills. No check ins. And comes back and doesn't really seem like she wants to serve us. Continuously cutting us short and walking away. Dishes sat on the table for a good 15-20 mins without being taken away even after we got our food packed up. Won't be back to this location. 

If you want to sit at a dirty table with no service, this spot is definitely for you"}
{"text":"We received the worst possible service last night. Our appetizer plates sat on our table all night until we asked for them to be removed. Our cups weren't taken away. The servers were lost and confused bringing us stuff in which we did not order constantly. Which wouldn't be an issue but it starts to get annoying when your 9 and a half months pregnant and they keep bringing alcoholic beverages. Common sense would say I didn't order that.. our server was very chatty with numerous of her tables. I'm talking about 10 minutes conversations with every table. We just felt like we needed to chase her to get her attention. We started asking other servers for help because our server was too busy for us. They weren't much help as they constantly were like \"no problem. Right away\" but never came back with what we asked for.  Our food was okay-bruschetta was a little salty but was good. My Thai chicken bowl was okay.. not very flavourful. Tasted like orange chicken from Manchu wok- wasn't a huge fan of the sauce. Boyfriend enjoyed his burger but said it had a weird aftertaste. Service was the far from okay. Probably won't come back to this location after this experience."}
{"text":"Worst possible service ever. We're seated at the bar during lunch time. Took 20 minutes to even have someone come over to ask us for drinks. We didn't see service after that. We had to flag down for our bill for 15 minutes to try to leave.. No one seemed to care about the service. Will never be back to this location."}
{"text":"Typical bar spot with ok dining experience. Food is just ok. I've had a range of service here: from being forgotten about for 25 minutes to great service. Inconsistent experiences. Prefer the front street location."}
{"text":"I recently started taking my kids here on weekends. They enjoy the food and our server Jessie is always amazing. He is not only always smiling but he's super great with the kids. 

He's always ready to make recommendations on what we should try and rarely are we disappointed. Try the poke if you like tuna and the wings with the ginger sauce. And the Asian nachos need to be put back on the menu -  those were AMAZING!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this place during the summer and wanted to sit on the patio for the great view. We have been to the restaurant before but it was the first time getting a seat on the patio. The view is amazing! 

I have never had any complaints with the food here. Every time I enjoy the drinks, I enjoy the food, and the staff are very friendly. They always serve you with a smile and make you feel like they actually want you to eat at this place. Great view, great service, good food, great atmosphere...can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Went here with friends after the movies.

Classic Jack Astor's atmosphere with great food and good service. Not much to say except that it was a great evening."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, wings not worth it. 7 wings for $12, covered in Hooter's breading holding tons of grease. Sauce was good. Friend liked the beer cheese soup, quesadillas nothing to write home about. Bartender attentive."}
{"text":"This is a massive three level restaurant and bar. The third level is a rooftop patio, which is hands down the best patio of any kind in the area. I think this particular location will serve as the Jack Astor's flagship location and perhaps used to improve the reputation of the franchise. The modern black brick exterior makes the building very attractive. The interior is equally interesting with it's modern industrial and open concept design. All three levels have TVs or projectors and there's no seat in the house without a half decent view of one.  

The California Chicken Salad was a miss. The chicken was moist and tasty but the rest of it was uninteresting and absolutely not worth $15 in terms of taste, quality or portion. The fried chicken in the Chicken Parmigiana was very good. The batter was nice and crispy and too greasy. This plate also comes with some bow-tie pasta topped with a delicious cheese sauce. Their Grilled Top Sirloin Steak Fajitas are pretty standard much like the ones you get at Lone Star. Steak and grilled peppers  and onions served in a greasy hot plate accompanied by warm tortillas and various dips. The steak was cooked perfectly and wasn't dry like you would get at some other places. 

The service is good thanks to an abundance of wait staff on the floor. Sometimes they serve in packs and you can't survey the room without making eye contact with at least one at any given time. There's still a few glitches with the service but that's normal since they opened less than two weeks ago.

{"text":"Little suprised by the bad reviews. Here on a work trip 10 of us walked in around 9pm on a Thursday and were immediately sat. Service was good. We all had beers and many people had the steaks. Everyone agreed the steaks were cooked perfectly. The rare was RARE. I had the salad. Was great. My salad was $19.50 Canadian and large 18oz local beer was $8.70 Canadian. Nice vibe and good service and food. I would recommend"}
{"text":"This place has great beers that are crisp and cool. The food is only OK. There's a patio out front but make sure you bring a gas mask because you'll be inhaling second hand smoke constantly. The best appetizer is the chicken fingers. They are heavenly! As for the bartenders, they need to cover up more - too much skin! I'm there for a beer, not a show. Great for groups and games nights are usually packed."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere every time i come here.
Customer service is always great if not exceptional -they care how ur food is along with the experience ! 
If the food is not up to par - they will gladly return it or offer something else 
I would recommend the- bow tie pasta, not to mentioned the cheese grilled bread, bruschetta, steak is excellent,kung pao stir fry. Pretty much everything on the menu is good."}
{"text":"I am the last person to say the customer is always right but the following is a shocking example of poor managerial judgement... proceed with amazement!

I should start by saying I like Jack Astors. The Pan bread is delicious, the bow-tie pasta is awesome and their cocktails are pretty good. This review is solely based on the garbage service I received upon my last visit. 

My co-workers and I reserved a table for 15 at 8pm in the lounge weeks ago. As everyone began to trickle in, the waitress took our orders. 

After 45 minutes one of my friends went for a smoke and was taken aside by the manager. Apparently our waitress went to high school with my friend and she felt uncomfortable serving us because of an argument they had when they were friends. I should add that my friend is 24 and graduated high school well over five years ago.

Instead of just getting us a new waitress, the manager asked my friend to leave and told him he didn't need to pay for his bill as a courtesy for being inconvenienced our friend told us he was told to leave, we all began packing our things to leave with him. The waitress was starting to come back with our entrees when she realized we were all going. She was very rude and asked if we planned on sticking around for the food we ordered and pay our tab. 

Within earshot of the manager we explained that it was completely unprofessional of her and her manager to ask a patron to leave without just cause. She is taking food and drink orders... if she feels uncomfortable she should suck it up or her manager should have assigned a new waitress.

The manager yelled that if we want to go we should just go. That night Jack Astors lost at least $400 from our table and I don't feel the least bit bad about it!"}
{"text":"Me: \"Turn up the Gino Beats\"
Waitress \"What?!\"

Exactly.... it's 6:00pm on a Sunday and this place is playing (horrible) music so loud that I can't hear my friends talking to me. I am all for loud music but this was not the type of establishment that should be cranking it up so early.

Our waitress was USELESS! We ordered a beer, and cocktail and some pan cheesy bread... the bread showed up 15 mins after we ordered with no drinks in sight. Our waitress came by and looked stunned that we had no drinks. REALLY?! Did you think they were going to make themselves and walk over here?! 

The service was painfully slow and I couldn't help but thinking that if the waitresses put half as much time doing their jobs as they did looking like club kids, things might look up for this location.

After all its situated in a rather convenient are of town and has a killer patio. Alas it is not so and I spent all night shaking my head at the leather wearing, bra showing tart that was seating people as they came in... (see picture)

Desperation has a new home it seems."}
{"text":"Classic chain restaurant... Only really bad. Nothing we had was good.
Calamari were drenched in oil. Dipping sauces were both bad.
Guacamole had more tomatoes than avocado.
Burger: meat was bland and overly greasy.
Fried chicken: completely tasteless... No salt no spices.
I think I've said enough about the food.

Service was very good and the ambiance is nice."}
{"text":"This place was certainly busy for a Wednesday and looks like a great place to hangout. This place is known for chicken fingers according to their menu. So I got that with poutine fries. The chicken was sooo fresh and it was sooooo yummy. I also got Rickards red which I really like. I wish we have this in the US. Not sure if they had a smaller size, but they served me XL sizes. I also love the american 90's pop and r&b. Really sets a cool atmosphere. Cheyenne was also a great and pleasant server. I had a great experience here. I wish I had more time in Canada so I can return back here. This place was certainly BANGIN'!"}
{"text":"One of the good Jackastors, lately I've been finding a hit and miss with this nice franchise.

This specific location still have the Buffalo chicken Cobb salad where most of the other locations stopped serving it, which is a big disappointment.
Watched the premier league game today, with the above, calamari and their famous bruschetta and their current holiday spec.
Friendly staff, this is a favourite spot at this plaza."}
{"text":"Pretty nice location IF you get lucky enough and score a patio seating.

The inside seating is nice as well, but nothing unique there, similar to all Jacks, but the patio is all what it's about at the Yonge & Dundas location!

The patio is a semi roof-top in the heart center of Yonge and Dundas square. It needs some good luck and determination to wait on line and be seated outside, but it's totally worth it.
Sitting at a high point, enjoying a cool breeze while looking down at Dundas Square and enjoying any shows or live performances that might be happening.

Located right across from the eaton's center, it's a good spot to grab a bite after a long day of shopping, although there are other great options at the mall itself.
There is also a movie theatre in the same building, so this is our usual spot if we're seeing a movie there, to dine in after.

Parking is an issue though, just like any place all over downtown, especially being in Dundas square, makes finding a parking spot harder. Best option is to park at the mall, and cross the road to the restaurant.

In terms of service, Jack Astor's are always consistent with their service quality, and the food is nothing different as well. Always call ahead of time to make reservations, it's not a big a place, and it's ALWAYS busy.
Good location."}
{"text":"*Update: I normally give second chances to restaurants that I give not so good reviews to, especially ones that I see room of improvements and potentials with a good solid brand.
Considering my bot so good experience at this location, I went again for a second and final chance at this location.

We arrived on a busy Saturday night, were told that there is a 45 minutes wait which was normal considering how busy the place is. We waited for about 10 minutes and we were called to the table, so that went better than expected.

In terms of 'service' which It was a major flaw last time, it has improved dramatically, our server Rick was on point, professional and helpful.

The food though seems to be going down in quality time after time at this location.
We ordered Nachos with Chicken to start, the Chips were stale, the cheese they now use seem to be some cheap slices chess, none of that original mozzarella mix! Few pieces of chicken, and it literally had only few of the other toppings! I had to fish for the peppers, tomatoes, etc...

I also ordered a NewYork steak, I asked for a baked potato to replace my mashed potato, and server said I Can't do that?! Why not? Not sure!
My mashed potato had ZERO seasoning and tasted very flat!
My steak that I ordered medium rare came more of a medium/medium well.
Side of vegetables were simply steamed vegetables with zero flavour and seasoning!

We also ordered salad with chicken, again zero flavour, flat dressing!

Jack's used to be the leader in this category of restaurants! Whatever happened to your menu, your flavours! Such a shame to see a great brand like this go downhill, or at least this location specifically, as there are other locations that do much better still!

My original 2 stars rating unfortunately go down to 1 Star now, and this will be the end of it for me at this location!
So unfortunate!
...........................

A very bad experience!
The 2 stars are only: 1 * for the assistant manager on shift for trying to make our experience better, and the other 1 * for a server named Sarah, who got assigned to our table to fix things, she was nothing but professional and great!
Starting with the host, the minute we entered the restaurant, she was neither friendly nor professional..while the other host guy next to her was clearly trying to patch things and being way more professional.
We were taken to our little table all the way to the end of the restaurant literally by the kitchen door, stating that all booths are reserved! We were there for about two hours, and none of these booths got seated, and the restaurant was maybe 40% full in and out!

We get our server 'Jeff' very quickly, greeted us and took our drinks and appetizers order. And that was the last time we ever saw or heard from Jeff. This guy was M.I.A , at least on our table as he was serving other tables all around us. After about 15-20 minutes, I had to stop one of the guys walking out of the kitchen, since I can't find my server! And told him about the appetizer, which then came out fairly quick after I asked..about 5 minutes.
Then the drinks never came, I had to hunt another server 'Sarah' and asked for the drinks that never came and to locate and call my server!
Again, the server never came! However, Sarah took over our table after that as advised by the assistant manager on shift. Who came and personally apologized for the experience, and offered us some discounts, which was a good touch from him.
Sarah on the other hand, was an example of what a great server is...professional and treat her guests with a smile,  very helpful, friendly and aware of the menu inside out!

The food itself was mediocre, the menu have changed recently, so some of the classics are missing, plus the flavours are all over t"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times.  The staff has all been exceptionally friendly. I was actually in here alone until close one night, first having a conversation about hockey with the bartender and the manager, and then one of the servers and I got into a conversation about dating, how it's difficult, how we usually have expectations which are unattainable by others..

But I digress.  They have a decent selection of beer. The food is nothing to write home about, though. It's not awful, but it's not memorable. So much so that I don't remember what I ate any time I had gone in.

The decor is interesting, with the \"chandeliers\" made from empty beer bottles. And the fun sayings on the backs of the staff's shirts were amusing to pass the time with, as well.

In all I'd recommend going, but don't expect to be blown away with your food choices."}
{"text":"Nice local restaurant very good burgers but stay away from the gravy and cheese on your fries totally horrible gravey tastes like burnt chicken grease and there's not cheddar or cheese taste with the cheese. Definitely worth the try"}
{"text":"I don't do chain restaurants. In fact, I am very much against them. I was therefore pleasantly surprised with the food here. I ordered the fresh never frozen sauced chicken fingers and..... They were the best chicken fingers I've ever had. The garlic bread is excellent if not a little greasy. As far as consistent, tasty, low-key pub food goes, Jack Astor's was pretty good.

Service: reliable but a little inattentive 

Price: the drinks are overpriced and the food is a little expensive for pub fare"}
{"text":"Jack's is consistent with their food items. You really can't go wrong with the chicken parmesan. What you can go wrong with is the poutine. I came here and got the hold the beef burger with a side of poutine, because poutine is amazing. 
Except at Jack's, which I forgot about until I saw the waiter coming towards us with our plates. Jack's likes to make their poutine formed like a cube with cold fries, cold gravy and cold cheese. This results in a cold glob of disappointment. The cheese curds are good... if only they were accompanied by hot fries and hot gravy."}
{"text":"This is just a typical chain restaurant. Of all the times that I've been here on late night weekends, I've only had one horrible waiter that I actually called back to speak to management. 

Otherwise, the staff are quite friendly. I prefer eating here rather than Moxies or milestones because it has a different type of vibe when coming here with a large group of friends. 

If you come between Friday - Sunday at night, be sure to have to wait a bit for a table!"}
{"text":"Its been a long time since I've ventured into a Jack Astors and I must say they've done a good job of improving upon themselves.  On the particular night I was here it was the date of Elvis' birthday so they were playing his music until about 7:30 and had a guy running around dressed up as Elvis.

Our server, Garmen, was fantastic.  He was prompt, friendly, helpful, and spot on with the timing of bringing refills of our drinks.  The food has really improved since the last time I've eaten here.  I had the Sauced Up chicken fingers which were really great.  I went with spicy buffalo and I must say that the spice balance was excellent.  They were just spicy enough to give you a run for your money, but not so hot that you were crying like a baby.  I also tried one of my wife's veg. fajitas which were also excellent (considering there wasn't any meat).

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've come here a couple of times now for some drinks with co-workers. The first time was really great and the second time was alright, overall 3.5 stars.

On the first trip they were sampling their pizzas which were tasty and which also meant I didn't need to order food. Bonus!

The second time I requested a drink they had never heard of but the result was still pretty close. Great job.

The service was excellent the first time but a little lacking on the second trip. I like the layout and decor, not a bad seat in the house.

November challenge 4/30"}
{"text":"Jacks is either a hit or miss type of place for me, depending on location.. I came here twice and the first time I really enjoyed my steak, second time I had a burger and I didn't care for it. I don't dislike this place nor do I love it.. but it's not bad. Sometimes I genuinely enjoy it, like I said hit or miss."}
{"text":"I just went for beer.. and only beer.. and 1 Small piece of calamari, a friend ordered. It was very greasy. I like jack Astors but I'm not a big fan of the food. I still do think the saucy marinated steak and shrimp and buffalo chicken wings and steak fahitas are the best things on the menu, that I personally recommend. We sat right in front of the bar, so the bartender was fast and non pretentious friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, great location with indoor and outdoor seating and good service. I always make sure to come here everytime I visit Toronto. Sat at the bar once and watched the bartender launch drinks through the air like a rocket. And make sure whatever drink you order, get it \"Jack'd Up\" for and extra kick!"}
{"text":"Pros
- Friendly staff
- Great drinks
- Fair pricing on drinks

Cons
- Small food portions
- Overpriced meals

Unfortunately, over the years, Jack Astors portions have gotten smaller and smaller while their prices go up. I wouldn't mind paying their prices if I left with a meal that truly filled me up."}
{"text":"I had no idea Jack Astor's had an outdoor patio. It is beautiful. The menu has never disappointed me. The staff are well trained and clearly have high standards to keep the Jack Astor's brand in tact. Rachel is the server to ask for. She is professional, pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong. I've been going to this location for more than 15 years. The people are wonderful,Ann-John is great, as are ALL the staff. 

But, this new Richard Simmons inspired-menu is disastrous. All the stuff that makes Jack Astor's Jack Astor's is gone. I will change my rating to 5 stars when the old menu comes back."}
{"text":"Waitress Bradie was amazing. Great customer service and she went over and beyond to see our visit was welcoming.

Brought us samples to try before we ordered a new soup which was great.  She had a great personality.

Food was very good as well :)"}
{"text":"Went there today and had a couple of burgers with the classic canadian poutine instead of just fries.

All of them were delicious. The stuff was friendly and the atmosphere of the place was warm. a lot of TVs showing games.

I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"We went to Jack Astors because we were staying at the Crowne Plaza near the Toronto airport and we LOVED it. The service is amazing, our waitress was very nice. I got a giant fishbowl Fuzzy Mango Breeze and was extremely satisfied! My partner and I ordered a Buddha Smile salad and a Hold the Beef burger and they came out quickly. We had a seat on the patio during a mild summer evening. I wish they had Jack Astors where we're from!"}
{"text":"This Jack Astor's Bar & Grill location is close to Union Station and definitely not a bad place to catch some World Cup Action.

The bar area has enough TVs that made me happy as I can watch 2 on going games at the same time.

Sitting at the bar is nice because it is easier to get one of the 4 bartenders attention faster when the place was packed with customers.

We ordered Poutine and Guacamole to share, nothing too amazing but good to snack on while drinking our beers.

Come early to beat the crowd for game day if you want the best seat in the house like me!"}
{"text":"This review is for a pre dinner drink and snack on the patio of Jack Astor's.

Beer selection here is quite decent for Richmond Hill, especially compares to other chain restaurants that shares the same parking lot! A stamp of approval from my Yelp Drinking Buddy the Beer Maven. 

We drank beers and shared a Gaucho Fries ($6.83) -  Yukon Gold fries tossed with mozzarella cheese and a semi-sun-dried tomato and garlic chimichurri sauce, parsley and feta cheese.

Nothing too amazing but the patio is nice and spacious.

I will always in for another drink before patio season ends!"}
{"text":"good environment,fair service,not enough attentive staff and in general Jack astors food portions are getting smaller! very disappointed that Steak Fajita was removed from the Menue"}
{"text":"Celebration our graduation. The decor was so so so cool and our waitress Susan was amazing! 
The Korean chicken wings/ ginger wings were very tasteful and you cannot say No to such a good treat! Next time I will come to try the salad called Smiling Buddha"}
{"text":"This place is what it is - a great place to grab average American food with a lively atmosphere - great for watching sports with the guys or hanging out in a place that has a pulse - with that said, I would never travel out of my way to get to a Jack Astor's - it is more a convenient location place when you are already in the area."}
{"text":"First let me explain that I give this location 3 stars, because Jack Astor's can only get 3 stars maximum given the type of restaurant/bar it is. 

Now with that in mind, we got exactly the experience we were expecting. At times the servers were quite busy and service may have been a bit slower than usual, however, they were very friendly and very flexible with our orders which was impressive. 

Overall it is great to have an alternative to a Boston Pizza or Wings Place where you can go for a casual drink and watch a game in Downtown North York. A welcomed addition to the area."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location since I was young, and still occasionally grab a bite to eat there when I'm seeing a movie in the area. I think that most of my good will towards this place is from nostalgia--after all, this place used to have barrels of peanuts and even an arcade, what else could a kid ask for? It used to be great; it used to revel in its own tackiness. A few years ago, they attempted to class the place up a little and the prices skyrocketed.

The food has never been top-notch, and yes, it's pricy, but it's decent if you're hungy enough. All in all, just a perfectly average place with perfectly average food, and uncharacteristically nice waiters and waitresses."}
{"text":"Jack Astors, the one on Dundas has a great view from roof top, the service was good and consistent on all the locations, they have a great collection of beers on tap and bottles... the poutine was great, didnt get a chance to try other stuff though..."}
{"text":"The service and selection is good.   Their steak selection is lacking.  The food was prompt and very flavorful.  Pricing was average.  
The reason to come here is the atmosphere.  Being here on a Hockey night, the place is hoping.  I would recommend and come here again."}
{"text":"Went there on a friday night with friends. I've never been to this place before and i was actually surprised about the quality of the food. I wasn't expecting anything about this restaurant, i don't know why. My friends ordered nachos,quesadillas and calamaris: three appetizers. We also ordered those super large cocktails, i don't remember the name exactly. 

When i tasted to food i was actually impressed by the quesadillas, i loved the taste and that spice ( not so sure what it was...) that they put on top of the tortilla. Also, the portion of the nachos plate is so much better than other places I've been to + they put lots of cheese :). The calamaris were good, nothing too special about it but i wouldn't mind ordering this plate again. 

The drinks were very good, like it didn't only taste like juice, i could really feel the alcohol in it ( just enough tho, which is perfect for me). 

The service and the ambiance were great. Honestly, i would love to go back to Jack Astor's."}
{"text":"Jack Astor's is famous for its slow service and I agree, it was slow when I went there for several occasions (5-6 times). 
I have no complaint with the quality of the food besides the slow service."}
{"text":"JacK astor is kinda hard to review because it's like everywhere! but then... there is ONE good thing that is... their server are like absolutely THE HAPPIEST and JOLLIEST I have seen so far! 

Makes the overall experience very pleasant! =)"}
{"text":"My burger was burned, there was no cutlery provided, we were never asked how our food was, I saw our server eating his dinner when I went to use the washroom. Never asked if we wanted water nor provided napkins till asked. I will not go back. Bad service and they messed up a burger
 Fuckers"}
{"text":"My friends and i used to come here to chill. It used to be pretty fun, too bad it hasn't been updated. DO NOT have group functions here. it's not worth it. 

I always saw the huge space in the back as an opportunity for a get together so I convinced my friend to do is birthday here early this year. For these reasons I'm never coming back:
1. Our server asked us to stay in the same seats all night. There was almost 30 of us. It made no sense
2. After we moved seats our server got a male server with a bad attitude to tell us we couldn't have separate bills because we changed seats. He was the biggest ass I've met.
3 We. received horrible service and attitude all night but when it was time to pay, all of a sudden our waitress was really sweet and nice. NO. doesn't work like that. I wish there wasn't a mandatory tip for groups

they wouldn't let us change the channel on the projector by our table.. we wanted to watch the fight. Really sucked.. they left on an unimportant hockey game that no one was watching.. and said they couldn't change the channel

I've never had a worse experience. Will not return."}
{"text":"I like the food here.  But I'm tired of music so loud that I walk out with a freaking migraine. It's NOT A NIGHT CLUB....LAST I CHECKED, IT'S A RESTAURANT.....??!! And what makes it worse is that I wrote SIR, the company that owns Jack's...They couldn't even be bothered to respond to my email.  So, until the excessively LOUD MUSIC ISSUE IS RESOLVED, my rating is now 1 star!  And if you don't want to shout to your table mates, or go deaf.... I suggest that you try somewhere else!  Sad, cause their food is good!"}
{"text":"I've been a Jack's fan for over twenty years (when there was only two locations).  This location, as with the others, offer superb food, great wait staff, and a unique ambiance.

I resist giving a perfect rating because the food can sometimes be inconsistent.  For example, one visit the wings would be great, the next soggy, greasy, stale tasting."}
{"text":"Took my kids here for lunch. Service was fast, food was delicious. We had nachos, hot wings, and Jack's (kids) Cheesy Pasta.

The wings at Jack's can be inconsistent, but at this location and on this day, they were spot on good!"}
{"text":"Service was good and quick... Food was ok... Beer selection was good, lots of people and all hockey atmosphere !!!:) fun place on Fri and Sat evening..."}
{"text":"The fries from the poutine was kind of cold and the gravy wasn't hot enough.  The waiter said he will cook us a fresh one himself next time.  And it barely had any chicken in the chicken salad."}
{"text":"The bacon cheeseburger and mashed potato + gravy were both delicious. The virgin blue raspberry was a little sour but I liked it not too sweet. Cheesy chalupa Tacos was ok. Not outstanding."}
{"text":"This was the second time we went to Jack Astor's after we had a horrible experience the first time. Reason for going back was because management wanted to redeem themselves and give us the experience they knew they would be able to provide. 

The second time around, the service and the food were great! The staff sang Happy Birthday to our 5 year old son to make up for the lack of acknowledgment towards his birthday on the original visit and the food and service were impeccable. 

Thank guys and keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I have visited this location many times. last year I signed up free for monthly deals at this location. They send me tons of stuff. I had one email that was a quiz. Just needed to fill it out and email it back to possibly win a prize. I won $100 night in at Jack Astor's with special seating and treatment. Pretty amazing night, in the end we didn't use the full amount and had an extra $40 left. We gave the credit to the table next to us to use. 

Recently I received a email about a breakfast buffet with Santa at Jack Astor's all free. All they ask is that you bring a donation of food product or unwrapped toy. This was amazing, my wife and I brought our 2 young kids. They got to meet and take pictures with Santa. Had a breakfast buffet of pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, lots of drinks. Then they built gingerbread men and houses. Amazing time and it was a great idea. 

Guys keep up the great work !!  On a side note if you ever have any issue with the food or anything. Ask to speak with the manager and all will be fixed. They are not always perfect but anytime I have had anything wrong the waitress always has the manager fix it before I ever ask."}
{"text":"These burgers are absolutely incredible! The Brie burger melts in your mouth. The Italian job burger has a cute name and even better taste. The poutine is terrific.

Once you get a server the service is fantastic. Teigan was super personable and had plenty of helpful advice."}
{"text":"It's a Jack Astor's, so you know what to expect. I've been here a few times and the staff is always good and attentive.  

I like this location in particular because it has three levels: the main floor is the bar area, second floor more for families, and the rooftop is a great patio."}
{"text":"If you are going for drinks in the upstairs \"lounge/bar\" than be prepared to seat yourself and be there a bit earlier than the dinner rush so you can actually be able to sit... 
The upstairs has a bridge that looks over the lower half of the restaurant which leads you to leather couches and a more relaxed area. 
Also located upstairs are not 1 but 2 bars! Your drinks do not take long at all to be brought to your table! 

And for you smokers.. the upstairs bar DOES have an outdoor mini patio for smoking so you don't have to go all the way downstairs.. so awesome! 

Favourtie food: Chicken fingers and Fries 
Favourite alcoholic drink: The Twister (JACKED UP) ;D"}
{"text":"If you live loud hip music.
If you enjoy heights and being outdoors.
Do you like waitresses in little black mini skirts?
Than go to Jack Astors!

This location is my #1 choice for all of toronto!
The outdoor skyhigh patio with lots of blasting speakers is the best part!!

The bar/patio get filled quick on weekends/ night time so make reservations or go early because you could be  waiting an hr for a table."}
{"text":"HUGE RENOVATED PATIO!
Smoking and Nonsmoking..
T.v's and outdoor bar!
Heated as well for cool nights.

Awesome staff!"}
{"text":"I had a $20 coupon as a customer appreciation and I really enjoyed the visit here. The waitress that served me was really polite and patient. I had the garlic bread, burger and a fries with gravy with ice cream for dessert. And all of my other friends got great service as well. Would recommend. 

The only downside is that the noise is a little loud so if you are looking for a classy dinner, this won't be the place."}
{"text":"This Jack Astor's is located in the heart of Toronto - \"Times Square\" of Toronto.  The staff were very nice.  The restaurant was clean.  The food was good."}
{"text":"My second visit to this location, hoping the second trip would've better than the first. No dice.

First stop here last summer the bartender was a douche to my friend and me. We came to watch World Cup soccer and have a brew. When I asked if there were any specials (happy hour?) he said \"this is Jack Astors, everything is expensive, what do you want?\" The rest of the afternoon the bartender spent most of him time flirting with the waitresses with his back turned to the customers.

Second visit: almost a year later. Went to rooftop patio for one martini but could not get any service for ten minutes of sitting at a bar table by myself.  Not even the bartender noticed I had not been served yet. I finally had to call out to a waitress to come over. She seemed annoyed and refused to smile. Said she would \"get someone\" for me and took off. I kept waiting. When another waiter finally came by, took my drink order, and returned 10 minutes later to tell me the patio bar isn't stocked with ingredients to make a MARTINI. It was going to be a while... 25 minutes later I got my lousy drink in a tall glass, not a martini glass. I ordered a double but it tasted like soda water with lime. The manager came over to apologize and say the drink is on the house... Naturally- since there's no booze in it.  

Shady Bar. Avoid at all costs. Jack Assery all around."}
{"text":"I always find myself at Jack Astor's on various occasions. It is right off the Highway and close to Scarborough Town Centre. They constantly change their menu for the season and to fit into trends. Last summer they had beef sliders, it was amazing!

The wait staff are friendly and service is pretty quick. They are accommodating of groups, I called a day ahead to make reservations for 9 people. Any group 8 and over there will be a 15% gratuity charge,, despite this our waitress was friendly, helpful and checked in our table a couple times throughout the dinner.

There are some pretty good items on the menu, including the burgers and garlic pan bread. Most recently I had the Asiago Chicken Bowties, very yummy! Jack Astor's also  has a good drink menu include beers and mixed drinks, the Blue Lemonade is good and more on the sour side than sweet.

I've had several of the desserts on the menu over the years including the mini brownie, the s'mores sundae and the cookie. All of them are good! 

Jack Astor's has always been clean and it's fun to draw on the tables (brings out the kid in all of us!) I will keep coming back to Jack's!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday night and it was pretty full.  I hadn't been to Jack Astors in a while so it was a blank slate for me. I got the classic double stack burger. The patties were pretty tasty but there wasn't enough sauce in the burger. I didn't really taste any of the mayo. Overall,  it was just okay. The veggies it came with was sparse, tasted microwaved and some of the broccoli looked like it was going bad.  I guess not many people order veggies as a side but they should still try to make it palatable. The service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Here are some quick stats:

100% of my recent out-of-town visitors have gone to the Jack Astor's overlooking Dundas Square
75% benefitted from the patio heat-lamps
25% were totally befuddled by the security roaming with Secret Service-style earpieces
50% gave points for the pun-heavy shirts that the servers wear
0% commented on the food

The draw of this location is...the location.  It's good for some at-a-distance people watching, and some touristy photo ops.  

(it's also hard to deny the appeal of confirming to servers, as they nod approvingly: \"I'd like my drink...jacked up!\")

This Jack Astor's is regularly busy, and often requires a wait at the bar until your assigned buzzer goes off, signalling an available table.  Service varies here: I've had some super-friendly and attentive servers, and also ones who might have forgotten that we were in their section.  Thankfully, in the case of the latter, the provided crayons kept us busy (guess the hangman word: h-u-n-g-r-y).

The menu offerings are standard chain restaurant fare - burgers, pizzas, wings, salads - though I should give a special shout-out to the nachos.  I like them, even though they are topped by a mix of cheese (real) and tangy nacho cheez (less so).  

Yelp Note: after a certain hour, this turns into Club Astor's (I mean, not *officially*, but the music gets loud, and things get to bumpin')."}
{"text":"I'll admit: I have a soft spot for the ball of corporate cheese that is your typical Jack Astor's franchise. I am hesitant to recommend anything on their menu, but I find their apps usually do the trick. At any rate, I'm rarely there to eat. Jack's is about drinks after work, or on a weekend afternoon. The Y&D location has a knockout patio and the service here is top-notch, i.e., those short black dresses are the perfect length. YOU know what I'm talking about.

Obligatory Title Pun: Rooftop patio is crackerJACK.

Menu Readability: Like most chains: an oversized laminated monstrosity with more colours and typefaces than a graphic design textbook.

Need to mention: Because of its convenient location this patio gets packed. Prepare to wait ungodly amounts of time.

What this place teaches me about myself: I just said I like the service here. That's not sexist. Sheesh. I can't believe we're still talking about this."}
{"text":"This place is just a T.G.I. Fridays with a DJ and dark lights..


I find the biggest fail for their \"known for\" chicken tenders which did nothing for me at all.. 



The servers are all pretty hot though but you'd never really know since you need a flashlight to read to menu"}
{"text":"Came here so many times, but a few days ago I finally decided to come check the restaurant out after their renovation. It def. looks way better now!

The service.. lets say.. was pretty horrible. The waiter probably checked up on us once and he was SO hard to reach. After receiving our menu, he didn't approach the area for a good 20 minutes, until we had to call him. However, he was really nice, he wasn't rude. I feel like each time you visit Jacks, it's a different experience with their waiter/waitress. They'll either be checking up on you here and there or not even trying.

The food was really good. I've tried a couple items on their menu from before, however their menu did get smaller after their renovation! I'd recommend the Asiago chicken bow tie pasta (add shrimp to it) and the holy smoke bbq burger."}
{"text":"Atmosphere aside, this place was an all around disappointment. Ordered the fried chicken sandwich and an order of hot wings with Parmesan fries. All in all everything we ordered was nothing short of terrible. Extra star for the free beer to make up for sending back food. Can't say that I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Great Patio, getting a broccoli and calimari. Service is good. Parking is hard to find"}
{"text":"This place is like every other overpriced Jack Astor's, but what really steps the game up on this one is their patio. It overlooks all of Yonge-Dundas Square, and in the summer it's a great place to eat, drink, and watch the city. My review for this location might normally be a 4, but the last 3 times I've come here I've had really weird servers.... As in they talk to us about the weirdest things and don't get our order right. I hate talking badly about service people since I work in service and I know it's difficult, but the last couple times I've had the same, strange experience. 

Also, if you want the patio in the summer - MAKE RESERVATIONS! Other reviewers are right when they say that this place gets super busy."}
{"text":"Not a while lot to say about this place that hasn't already been said - honestly Jack Astor's is just a pricey American restaurant. I will say that this location is a little better than most just because of the patio in the summer, which is so beautiful at night!"}
{"text":"The only thing I enjoyed about this place were the flowers on the patio. It is a bit deceiving. The food was not enjoyable & left us feeling ripped off, not to mention still hungry. It seems others haven't had the same experience with the food so we may have ordered the wrong thing. There are a lot of options on the menu, maybe a specialization would benefit the chefs with practice. Some of the waitresses were quite disturbing. I get the whole short skirt thing but exposed cellulite but cheeks aren't very appetizing. I kid you not, there were at least a few occurrences where I was flashed during my meal. Very disturbing."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I were walking around Front Street on a Thursday evening looking for a spot for dinner. Unfortunately due to a Maple Leafs game, every place had a long wait. This Jack Astor's location was also full, but we were able to get a spot on the patio with heat lamps in 2-degree weather.

Perusing through the drink menu, I spied with my eye a sangria. If you know me, you know that I love sangria. The citrus sangria came in mix-your-own glasses. A small comes with enough liquid for 2 drinks. As expected, I loved it. The alcohol wasn't strong and the drink was sweet and fruity.

I ordered the smokin' salmon cooked medium. It was cooked perfectly. I enjoyed the tender salmon, the al dente rice, and soft citrusy cherry tomatoes. The avocado on the side was a nice touch.  Our group also ordered the nachos to share. The nachos were warm and delicious. I enjoyed it with the sour cream dip.

\"Sangria\" K. out"}
{"text":"I love going to Jack Astors!  All the servers are very nice and helpful.  They will chat with you about more than just the menu, which is great when you're alone.  The food is awesome and I haven't had a bad experience yet.  I'm originally from Ontario and have been to many other Jack Astor's and was a little hesitant when going to this one because its the only one out West.  I've been to other restaurants that have tried to branch out of their home province or country and it just hasn't worked out so I was little scared but this place is just as good!  Hats off to the owner for keepin' it real!"}
{"text":"It's a nice atmosphere. If you are into sport there are lots of televisions. There is a patio with a nice view of Yonge-Dundas Sq. The bartenders were not rude, but not overly friendly. They were very rushed!! They were moving so quickly and there was a long wait for service. They never did check back with us and I noticed they also didn't check on the man next to us who had ordered food at the bar. I didn't eat so can't comment on the food, but based on the service I'd lump this into the chain restaurant category and seek out some other bars in the future."}
{"text":"We were in for tiff and hadn't eaten before the show on Thursday night. We selected this place because it was open at the late hour that we walked up, it was around the corner from the Fairmont, our hotel and they had inviting outdoor seating. 

I was not familiar with the chain beforehand, but once I sat down, it reminded me of a Canadian TGIFridays. That said, the salad and chicken fingers weren't bad and my husbands local beer was tasty. Under our overeager server's advisement I went for the Blue Raspberry Lemonade 'Jacked-up'. It tasted like someone had only mildly dissolved a blue razzle airhead. Too sweet for my taste, and I like sweet fruity drinks, and once I was a third of the way through it, I was 'jacked'. Thankfully my hotel was around the corner, my husband had no complaints as he finds 'tipsy Dayna' to be a happy, funny and even more clumsy drunk than Dayna sober. But I was not particularly pleased."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and a wide variety of things on the menu to appease everyone (although this location recently streamlined their menu, still lots of choices though). Excellent chicken fingers.

The interior redesign was done nicely, they could still use more upgraded TVs throughout the dining room but they do their job. 

The food is better than any other chain dinner restaurant and the ambiance is very relaxed. 

My one grievance is that the parking lot is an absolute disaster and it will take no less than 15 mins to find a spot in the main lot. This isn't the restaurant's fault so I won't penalize them for it."}
{"text":"This always seems to be the go to place downtown when I'm attending any type of event at the ACC or the Rogers Center. I recently went this past Thursday after a lovely Jays win in their own back yard. We were lucky we didn't have to wait to be seated. We got a booth in the bar area that fit all 6 of us comfortably after pulling up so extra seats. 

Our waitress was friendly and attended to us as soon as we sat down. Came right away for our drink order and asked if we needed food menus? We responded and she was back a few moments later with them. Just as she was about to walk away we had to stop her and tell her that our table was dirty from the previous people. We were surprised she didn't take notice of that the first time around. She seemed annoyed but returned with a cloth to clean it up.

We order a pitcher of beer, nachos, poutine, and another crazy fries mixture that included feta cheese. The entire meal came out quickly and fresh, it was tasty,filling and we all just shared the appetizers. What I like about chain restaurants is that you usually know what you are getting yourself into when it comes to any type of meal. 

All in all good experience and I will most likely be back again when their is a new event in town."}
{"text":"My friend recently moved into the condo's located at the \"Shops at Don Mills\" and this has be our go to spot. We have been there twice in the last week alone. I enjoy the service and the customer interaction. When we arrived last Friday night we were hoping to be seated in the bar. they only had a table to seat 5 guests and in total we would be 6. Since all the guests have not arrived as of yet the hostess suggested that we take the table for 5 and when another table opens up we can move over to that area. I was a little hesitant because it was a night filled with different important sports games on all screens. We happened to be very lucky because as we sat down another table close by was leaving and they attracted the table to ours to accommodate everyone. That night we noticed the food was delicious, service was fast and the environment was welcoming. 

They second time we went we sat inside the lounge/dinning area.. great service just like the time before.. our waitress was great with product knowledge, and helping my friend decide on what to order. She was extremely peppy and upbeat. Great attitude for sure which is what will keep us coming back"}
{"text":"I went here for New Years with two of my friends,  and we had a good time.  Our service was great and our waiter was really nice. 

I had a frozen drink and I loved it,  it was really yummy.  

We didn't get any apps,  we went straight for our meals. I got the fish and chips,  and it was okay to say the least.  Maybe I've been watching to much Chopped Canada,  but the presentation was... Okay... 

Also on a side note, I had no idea that Jack Astor's did not serve coleslaw on their menu! 

When I ordered the fish and chips and got my food I was surprised that the coleslaw wasn't there so I asked my waiter about it.  He said that the actually didn't serve coleslaw (and I believe he also said baked potatoes)  on their menus.  I was shocked. 

What's fish and chips without coleslaw? Is it just me or is that just plain weird?? 

My friends liked their food,  so that was good.  

Also this was my first time going to a resturant on News Years,  so when it was coming down to the count down they handed out party favours,  like the ones you blow into to make noise so that was fun. Though,  they didn't have enough and two of the girls at the table behind didn't get any.  And mine didn't make any noise .  

In my humble opinion, they should have given out free shots to their customers 

Overall,  the atmosphere was lively and the service was great.  I just wish I had a better food experience.  

Oh well,  maybe next time."}
{"text":"I normally don't frequent chain establishments but i came here for a birthday party about a week ago. The service here it was just so awful that I cannot even begin to describe how useless the servers were. 

Even though we had made reservations and we showed up on time our table was not ready. We ended up waiting about 25 minutes at the bar for table for 10. We were side towards the back of the restaurant which is fine, except that they didn't turn on the chandeliers that were hanging in the back until we were settling our top. So we were wondering why it was so damn but it was actually really hard you going to read the menu. The waitresses were overwhelmed and got all of our food mixed up our water was never brought it to us our drinks were not good-quality - I would not recommend them. I ordered a Cesar jacked up and it came with out the rim and it didn't even taste like there's any alcohol in the cup. Also I had asked for extra spicy and it wasn't spicy at all. I could table I had ordered a twisted drink which was sort of like Bellini with two shots of vodka but they must've used sugar water because You could not taste any Alcohol in it at all. A few of the other people on the table felt the same way. The food itself was a complete disaster. My so ordered the chicken sandwich and he ate about 60% of it when you realized that the middle wasn't caught and he couldn't tell because it was so dark where we were sitting. We sent it back and the waitress was not even apologetic. She took off the sandwich but not Said two beers that he also ordered, I guess people getting sick at the restaurant is not worth covering $14 of their top. Very bad customer service. For my meal I ordered chicken on top of ravioli and when it came it smelled awful almost like the cheese on top was bad. I sent it back and it came out with different cheese sprinkled on top and it didn't smell as bad as the first one, it was edible but it wasn't good. I wouldn't recommend that either. Overall, Never coming back here again. It was surprising because most JA's have pretty good service."}

The food was great!  The service was spectacular!  The drinks were amazing!  Such a fun environment to sit relax, chat, eat, and drink."}

-Typical of a JA.
Server:
-Not able to provide details on their menu.
-Forgot to bring drinks.
-Mixed up the food order once.
Food Quality:
-Quality and flavour of the meats was good, not great.
-I'm not sure about the drinks as the server completely forgot about them, and we decided to go for drinks elsewhere."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were coming back from the west end and decided to catch a movie and this was the only restaurant close by that had a wait shorter than an hour. This place is probably meant for teenagers - they've sort of changed up the offering to be a bit more classy than it used to be in the 1990s (dark panelling et al).  Don't come here if you want quiet - lots of obnoxious top 40 music blasting, and tables and tables of teenagers with birthdays screaming their heads off.  Wowza.

Food was also terrible.  I wasn't hungry in the first place but I ordered some Thai Chicken Rolls (I believe) and the wrappers had clearly not been soaked long enough.  The chicken was also dry.

Our server was nice but seemed quick to get us out of there (which we were happy to oblige with.)

Bottom line: if you're a 17 year old who wants to look cool, this is your place.  If you're anyone else, go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I came here around 9pm on a Saturday with a friend of mine and there was a long wait as expected, but I was thoroughly impressed by the customer service at this location.

We weren't expecting to be seated right away since it was a busy night, but the staff came around with appetizers and offered them to people waiting in the foyer. After waiting around 30 minutes, our party of two still weren't seated but we didn't make a fuss about it since we knew it was busy. One of the staff members, i'm not even sure if he was a host or a server, saw that we were still waiting and asked us if had been called yet. We told him no, and he said he would get us a table right away. Shortly after, we were seated.

The food itself was as expected of any Jack Astors. I ordered a cocktail that was too strong and sweet for my liking, so after one sip, I left it to the side. Our server was friendly and always came by to check on us. At the end of the dinner when we were about to pay, he asked me if I liked my drink and I told him I didn't but that was because I wasn't too fond of sweet drinks but that it was okay. He insisted that he take it off my bill even after I argued that I would pay for it since I had chosen to order it. 

We did not expect to be treated with such hospitality so upon leaving, I made a note to give this location a review based on the wonderful customer service I had received."}
{"text":"We went shopping at Shops at Don Mills. Come lunch time, we walked towards Jack Astor where there are no construction. Can't stand the dust and noise whatever they are building near Bier Market and Joe's.  So here we are at Jack Astor's. I asked if their coffee is good. Yes! They only serve Starbucks. Five star for that. But my order of a grilled chicken quesadillas came in soggy. Very disappointing. The Brie burger is grilled perfect. No complaints on that. The sweet potato fries are extra charge. Overall, not bad. But may not come back here for awhile."}
{"text":"Really good! Came here a couple days ago with my squad and we were seated at the booth near the bar. Love all the TVs the place has and the t-shirts that the servers wear, some favorites: \"Odd numbers literally can't even\", \"I can't finish anyth\", etc.

Food's really good. Got the fish and chips with the gold yukon fries and that was great. The bruschetta is amazing. 

The blue lemonade from the alcohol menu is really nice, but the hawaiian punch drink tasted like cough medicine, so don't get that one. 

It was also my friend's birthday and all the servers came out, told him to stand on his seat and dance along to I'm a Little Teapot with them as they sang it, it was cute.

+ Good food
+ Good service
+ Affordable

No real cons."}
{"text":"Had occasion to eat here twice while on a business trip in Toronto. The menu had a wide selection of food and both entrees I got were very good. I had a cheeseburger with a side of veggies one day, and the chicken parmigiana the next. The service was competent on both visits, although they forgot an appetizer on the first visit. No big deal, it happens. The interior is nice and has several levels, and there is an outdoor terrace as well. I enjoyed both visits and would recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"Great service having a large party and great food...

Main server just needed to be on the ball, we had to get our own utensils... other services we great

Best to make reservations bc it gets really busy!"}
{"text":"My first visit to this particular Jack Astor's location was right before the Blue Jays home opener last week and probably the most indicative of a peak night of business for the restaurant. I arrived just before 5pm and it was absolute anarchy (but in a good way) in the place. 

The front entrance was spilling over with people trying to (unsuccessfully) get a table, but they hadn't made a reservation so they were being turned away. Luckily our group HAD made a reservation so we didn't have any issues getting a seat. Essentially though from 5pm until 7:15pm when the game started, the place consisted entirely of people on their way to the Jays game. So if you don't like baseball, or being around rowdy pre-drinking Jays fans, DO NOT go here on game night. Here's the schedule: http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/tor/schedule/home_schedule.jsp

All of the (hot) servers join in on the sporting fun and are decked out head to toe in Jays caps and jerseys. The service was decent considering we were such a rowdy group and the place was so busy. 

I love ordering the Chicken Parmesan Bowtie Pasta (aka farfalle) without the chicken. It's really creamy and has sundried tomatoes in it, and the portion is good. I also like that the servers always deduct $2 from the cost of the meal because I'm not getting any meat on it - a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Not arriving to the city until nearly midnight, my friend and I happened upon Jack Astor's, one of the few places in the area still serving dinner.

Choosing to sit inside, we were seated at a booth along the back wall. We each started out with an order of the 22 oz. Canadian Lager, and then continued with shares of the veggie pizza and chicken caesar salad. While everything was tasty, it wasn't more than standard bar fare.

I'd recommend Jack Astor's if you are in the area and in the mood for a solid sports bar!"}
{"text":"If I could I would rate this place as 3.5 stars. The food was 4 while the service was 3. With that said, all three dishes that we ordered were really good. I highly recommend the Bombay Chicken Curry, The South American, and the Pad Thai. All very tasty and well executed."}
{"text":"I wanted to take advantage of all the birthday deals, and one of them was for a free dessert at Jack Astor's. Since Jack Astor's got rid of my favourite apple pie dessert (so sad), I have yet to try their new dessert menu. So I thought this was a good opportunity to do so. 

We added a caesar salad to our entrées for $2.77: crisp romaine lettuce tossed in creamy garlic dressing topped with grated Parmesan Romano cheese. They were pretty generous with the bacon bits. 

Jack's signature chicken fingers: chicken tenders, marinated, seasoned and breaded in-house to order. They were served with fries and dipping sauce. Jack's chicken fingers are supposedly never frozen, and these were pretty good and tasted fresh. Of course, it's hard to mess up with chicken fingers, as I generally find the frozen ones quite enjoyable as well. The breading wasn't too thick and the meat was tender and juicy.

I was actually really disappointed with their new dessert menu. There were only four choices. In the end, I opted for New york vanilla cheesecake, described as a deliciously rich and smooth cheesecake with a graham cracker crust, served with seasoning topping. The cheesecake was decent, but definitely not the best that I've had. I wished that the texture was creamier, and slightly softer. But I won't complain since it was free! However, I wouldn't come back here for desserts."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place mainly for my oldest son's birthday back in the days. I always enjoyed it. But you can tell when things are on the down swing and they are cutting corners. I always remembered their chicken wings. But they were good and nice size. No more!!!
I was looking for something healthy on the menu and I struggled. Really struggles so I ordered the Chick magnet, Was small which was fine with me with a large salad but both pretty tasteless. 
I must say service was excellent. And really put my daughter on the spot singing to her \"Happy Birthday\".
Decor has been the same for ever. We sat in the Elvis shrine. lol...."}
{"text":"Well don't have high hopes to begin with. Each dishes is around $20~ not too expensive but honestly doesn't taste good at all. Especially for the smokin' salmon with 7 grain rice. Salmon is overcooked with the burned taste, whole dish is very plain. But I guess these kind of bar is not a good place for dinner but a place for beer and games."}
{"text":"Great comfort food! We tried buffalo wings, pouting, chips and cheese and a huge, delicious hamburger. The food was a pleasant surprise. Jack Astor should have more branches for ease accessibility by their clients"}
{"text":"I was here with a friend just before Christmas for dinner.  There's a lot of people here since it was a saturday night and also Jack Astor's being right outside the movie theater in the mall.  We waited about 15 min and got seated in a both by the bar.  I have been to other Jack Astor's before so I knew what to expect and the menu hasn't changed very much.

The servers where pretty quick and the food arrived in decent time.  I got the veggie burger and my friend ordered a pizza.  The food was pretty good and the price was ok.  There was loud music playing and the place was really dark, if you are in the mood for that, then it's the place to be!

Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Réal l'y enjoyed lunch there during a business trip. The place was fairly busy but we did not have to wait to get served. The food was amazing and the staff really nice. Will definitely go back when in town!"}
{"text":"Service is so-so. Food is also so-so. They are definitely more interested in shoveling out food quickly more so than taking care of the quality and details. I would prefer giving Casey's across the street a try or another of its kind in the future after a game.

That being said I do enjoy the Jack Astor's by my house in Mississauga."}
{"text":"This is a regular spot for us. Overall we enjoy coming here. The place has a good vibe and the menu has good variety. They have recently made some changes to their menu and we are not so sure we like it yet but we will visit a few times to give them a fair chance before we decide. Service tonight was great. Jess was our sever and she's very friendly and approachable. She checked up on us just enough as she never interrupted our meal but always made sure we were ok. We had the bruschetta and a pound of medium wings. The bruschetta was ok. It had a bit too much of the garlic ailioli sauce - we prefer more of the balsamic sauce instead. The wings were good but they could have been cooked a. It longer. Overall we will be coming back again. A good mix of service, food and atmosphere that are all equally pleasant.

{"text":"It is what it is, a chain resto. Not bad, I've been here a few times, sometimes awkward service. Tonight we had a great waitress from austrailia apparently. Friendly and helpful. 

Strange though, the manager comes out to bring my friends dish and said to me that my dish will be late and that it is on the house because it is late...( it fell on the floor was his explanation .... Really did I need to hear that? Confused me for a second to think that it fell on the floor and they will be serving it to me) so they had to make another, hence the delay. He also said that if I wanted anything in the mean time it will be complimentary ... 
After I straightened out what happened to my dish I said asked \"so what were they offering us...\" The manager retracted the complimentary part saying sorry for the delay but if you want to order anything else in the mean time let him know... Ok so no complimentary dish.
He later brings my dish says sorry and asks my name even ! then shakes my hand. Asks my friends name and shakes his hand.

.... All this to say
We get the bill and nothing has changed. I get charged for my delayed dish!! 

I don't get it.
The manager makes a big deal out of the delay and the dish on the floor and shakes my hand and promises nachos or something complimentary then says my fallen dish is on the house .....What was the big deal about if you aren't going to follow through?

If you are going to make a mistake fine make one - it happens- but this huge display of insincerity makes me feel sick.

So basically if there's a mistake in your order at this establishment they will make it up to you by getting to shake the managers hand and fake offers to make up for it then Its taken back them back. 

Wow. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"My server was a very pleasant, attentive gentlemen, who made the evening somewhat pleasant. The poutine was terrible. They did that bowl thing they do to rice to make it look pretty, rethink that, haves meeting in regards to who came up with the idea to do that to the poutine. When you do, lecture them on sense and sensibility so that doesn't happen again. Wait I forgot, someone decided a sheet of lament paper as a menu was a good idea, sooo I'd say a huge meeting is in order.  The wings were wings... 
I haven't eaten at a Jack Astors in years, and will continue to avoid this chain."}
{"text":"Decided to try the new turkey burger on their special \"festival\" menu.  Once ordered it didn't take too long for the food to arrive, around 15 mins or so.  I had a bite of the turkey burger and the taste was definitely different. I took a couple of more bites and tried to allow the flavour to hit my taste buds. There's a special sauce that comes with the burger that's a little spicy and tangy. The burger's loaded with your typical toppings and the patty is made up of white and dark meat in an attempt to balance a healthy and tasty choice. Now what made the burger quite different was the seasoning. I've had some turkey burgers before and sometimes they come up dry or sometimes just greasy. This patty was tender and moist, but to me I just didn't like the seasoning. There was a certain something that just didn't go well. And this burger was seasoned well all over. Overall, it wasn't great, but it was horrible. But it wasn't good enough for me to order it for a second time. Maybe having it on for a limited time was a good move by Jack Astor's. If you must, go in and try it out."}
{"text":"Excellent place! Thanks to the manager Mark who was totally awesome after a terrible experience from the restaurant beside them called Marlowes. Marlowes not only disappointed us with rude behaviour, attitude, terrible customer service and the manager who wouldn't give us the owners name. We left and walked into Jack Astor's where we not only felt welcome, offered us free apps for our terrible experience from their neighbour, superb customer service, didn't rush us and gave us gift certificates when we left! Super nice staff with 3 attending our table all night, excellent drinks & food, Thanks Mark & the team, I will definitely recommend you guys and we will be back! I wish I could give you more stars!"}

{"text":"Came here for a birthday with 4 friends, and I wanted to go to a chain American cuisine restaurant to celebrate. I would say this visit was subpar but I would say it is not the establishments fault, but the chain in general. 

The decor is comfy and it was relatively clean, but the problem for me was the menu, where it felt short and a thought of \"that's it?\" The prices were higher than places like Kelsey's and I felt that the portions were smaller as well. I was not full after ordering the seemingly big burger that was $17 on the menu. Another negative on my part was that they asked if I wanted gravy and unbeknownst to me, it was an extra $1.50 on the end of the bill. Our waiter did not tell me and I would have really done without it if he said it was extra. I didn't make a big deal about it but... Yeah. 

He had decent service, but it took a bit of extra time to flag him down because it was very busy. We received the small free birthday brownie dessert thing and went on our way after that. This visit was not the greatest and I probably wouldn't come again for a while."}

{"text":"This review is just based on one drink. We did not have food here.

Thursday night, my friends and I were looking for a bar to grab a quick drink as our last stop for the day. We came across Jack Astor while strolling in downtown Toronto and trying to chase the CN Tower, which turned out to be a bit farther than we expected.

There was a gentleman at the entrance, we asked if we can see the menu and he said go right ahead. The menu on display did not have the drinks, but we ended up just sitting at a table by the bar. Chris was our server. He was very kind and attentive.

We ended up ordering a Beach bowl drink to share. When it was delivered, the drink reminded me of the Punch bowl from Benihana and RA Sushi. The drink tasted like 100% soda and I think there was more ice than liquid. I've worked in restaurants before and the drink we got was alright.

Overall, Chris' service was good but the drink was ok. I also went inside to find the restroom. I asked the hostess ladies inside and one of the girls didn't seem like she wanted to help."}

Annie took care of the 12 of us and no one was left waiting for food or wondering where it was at. I'm pleasantly surprised to see everyone working together this time around and will definitely go back."}

I came here month ago with a friend... today I decided to give it other chance as it is raining so there was not option.. servers came to our table with such an attitude.. he put the menus on table when table was with dirty plates and dirty all around the table... I asked him if he could please  clean the table first ... he showed me such an attitude just because we asked that..
 He didn't even clean properly and asked my friend to help him to clean.... this service is soo bad... never come back again.... no manager came over either"}
{"text":"I had the famous chicken fingers, and it was amazing!

Boneless, crispy on the outside but warm and tender on the inside.i can confidently say it was one of the best fingers I've ever had!

The service and seating was average, however it is a sports bar so my expectations were not high to begin with. The booth where we sat had a gimmicky light that would randomly turn off and on while we were eating, which definitely took away from that experience.

Other than that, it was a great dinner with the boys; great place to grab beers and chat about sports and work, while enjoying some fingerlicking good wings!

{"text":"My hubby's fam are Canadians from Ontario. And if you're in the Ontario area, apparently this is a huge chain equivalent to a TGIF (except with hostess service, pool tables, outside patio, and dance floor). We head out on a Wed night and ask for a table in the outdoor patio. A young hostess told us there were no seats and if we were willing to wait a half hour. We were still missing an add'l person from our table so we decided to wait til our party was there. 
 
We walked into the bar to see if there were seats inside. And once we cross into the outdoor patio, not only were there seats but empty tables everywhere. Luckily, his cousin knew the bartender at Jack. Apparently, the hostess is a newbie who has been coping an attitude with patrons all day. This explains the no seating policy. 

Our waitress took our drinks and chatted for a bit. She recommended the two flavors slush (raspberry & lemon) with two shots of raspberry vodka. Everyone else ordered beer. The slush was too sweet for my taste buds but an interesting mix. We shared fries and wings that were pretty good. It's a good place to hang out after work or mingle with friends."}
{"text":"Very mediocre. 

The beer they served was very watered down, tasted horrible, and made me feel somewhat queasy. I won't be going again next time I am in the mood for a drink.

The food was decent, but not many options if you're not in the mood for something full of carbs. Overall it was nothing special and full of gimmicks, as you expect from these kind of chains.

The service, while friendly, was spotty due to the restaurant being very understaffed. Management really needs to take care of their employees better since it was borderline ridiculous."}
{"text":"I was there 3  nights ago with my hubby and baby. The food came looks great taste good. Halfway through eating my husband found a HAIR in his food. It was steaks and mash potatoes. The waiter was nice he said he would replace the meal and not have to pay. We wanted to let it go but our evening is now ruined. 
 My meal was ok but I couldn't continue eating so we ordered dessert to go. The bill came but he still charged for the meal with hair in it. My husband don't usually want to cause a scene so he paid. I saw the bill only after he paid. 
So not nice. I don't mind having to pay for our meal but we couldn't finish our food, the evening was ruin. I stopped eating because all I can see is the hair next to his steaks so I kept checking my food. Then we were still charged for it. 
This was our first time there for dinner as a family. Mistakes happens but why do I have to pay for it? 
Very disappointed!!"}

The drink menu has a wide range of many drinks.  The fish bowl cocktails are huge!!  And the sangria is delicious as well.  The only thing is that they didn't give us enough wine to mix with the juice.
Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Dope, chill spot right in downtown Toronto. Came for lunch and got a seat outside. Seems like it's a popular place because everyone I spoke to said only great things about it. Got the wings which were good. We also had the poutine which was surprisingly weak. My buffalo Cobb salad was good tho. The server was pretty chill. I forget his name but he was def on top of it. Will be back an recommend."}
{"text":"This place has the best rooftop patio around. Great service, great food, great drinks. In the summer the patio has these mist machines to keep you cool, and they provide sunscreen on every table."}
{"text":"Friendly staff who are great with kids, but barely average food means this Jack Astor's can only get three stars."}
{"text":"Great food, service is friendly and efficient. They cater well for kids too.
I really like the burgers, and my wife loves their desserts. It can get very busy at times, but there is a bar section where you can order the same food if the wait is long in the restaurant section."}
{"text":"This place is always busy, but I guess that is because of the location rather than the food. Could be worse, but wouldn't be hard to make the food better than deep fried grease. There's a decent sized patio, which is a good for a beer before/after a game, but don't come here hungry and expect to leave satisfied."}
{"text":"I chose to come here for dinner because I was at  Eaton's and I wanted something close and easy. Mainly because I was also craving nachos. This is your typical dark, loud, sports bar atmosphere. I ordered nachos, a medium rare steak, and a drink. 

My nachos were great, but you can't really mess that up. The medium rare steak was overcooked. When we brought it up to the server, she took a look, agreed and gladly returned it to the kitchen. The manager came over shortly and apologized and also waived the steak from our bill and gave us free dessert. 

Our steak definitely turned out better the second time around. It wasn't great, but it was acceptable. My drink was huge and you definitely get your money's worth of alcohol!

Also wanted to note that two tables away from us, the server spilled two waters on one of the guests. Yikes!"}
{"text":"Descent salad. The menu is packed with something for everybody.  feels like you are at a sports bar/ night club. Music videos and sports playing simultaniously."}
{"text":"\"Jack Astor's\" ... is a terrible name.

In fact, it is so terrible that it is the primary reason that I didn't set foot in this restaurant for some time.

Also, knowing it was a chain, hearing it wasn't that great, were all contributing factors to avoiding it.

But after being dragged here one night, I finally tried their food ... and was surprisingly blown away.

Everything is clean and well prepared.

The thing that amazes me the most is that their \"Holy Smoke BBQ Burger\" is downright near burger perfection. As burgers go, the whole thing is pretty much exactly, in my opinion, what a burger should be. Gooey processed cheese, thick bacon, crispy onions, spicy mayo and a bun that is absolutely to die for.

I'm not sure if it's a recent development or not, but they claim that now their burgers take their inspiration from Warren Leruth, an American restaurateur who the Jack Astor's menu claims to have perfected the burger. I find it hard to disagree."}
{"text":"I have been to this Jack Astor's location many times and always had great experiences with the welcome staff, servers and you are served in a timely matter here. My first experience that is making me rethink coming back here was today's experience with our server, Sarah. I was in a group of four and we had enjoyed our food and paid our bill. She had came back and asked us how her service was and if we had meant to only leave 5% tip. It was an honest mistake because I thought I had left 10% which I did end up giving her, but that experience left our mood at the table with discomfort. I am usually a well tipper, so this was a first and regardless I have never had any type of server ask me if my tip was substantial. I never had an experience where a server asked me \"did you mean to only tip me 5%\". If I were to be technical it was 8% and thinking back I regret leaving her the 14% after. I should have ordered a large chicken wings order and left her 0%."}
{"text":"Solid vegetarian burger (\"hold the meet\") with sweet potato fries was delicious.While the service was a little slow, the food was good and drinks were cold. Check it out and you likely won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Make sure to ask for Zack at the bar! Not only did we get an incredible meal and service but a show as well! Andrea the manager was an absolute gem. The staff works together as a team which is also lovely to see. 

You really feel at home here! Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I sit in the bar and have never had a problem that wasn't corrected immediately. 

For a Jack Astors it's actually not all that bad. Bar is loaded with TVs, it has a patio, location is very central to everything. The plaza is a mess on weekends though. 

For the food it's a solid 3 in my books. If you're coming here for what you should be (fries, chicken strips, burger) then it's good food. I've had the salmon/steak and some of their salads and wasn't left impressed. But you don't come here for that!!!

I personally like the bruschetta, it tastes nothing like real bruschetta but still tastes really good. Nachos are alright too.. but the burgers are my favourite. 

3/5 for me for the location and good bar grub!"}
{"text":"I don't make a habit of going to Jack Astor's, but I have to admit, I do love me some cheesy pan bread and Jacked-up bloody caesars. 

My usual dining companion is American, and had never been to a Jack Astor's location. This means he'd never read the stupid things written on the back of all of their shirts and felt awkward, never had a server write their name upside down on a brown paper table cloth, and most importantly, he'd never had the cheesy pan bread!

We sat on their pretty John St. patio, we had mediocre service, we didn't really enjoy our lunches... aside from the cheesy bread. I will follow those greasy pans to hell, and now, so will he."}
{"text":"Haters gonna hate, and I hate recommending one of the Chain Gang to visiting friends and family. That being said, this location has some major perks for tourists. 

It is undeniably central and near many hotels, The Eaton Centre, TO Tix (our sub-par version of NYC's Half Price Tix) and is housed in the same building as the multiplex formerly known as AMC. 

This particular Jack Ass location has a massive (heated if necessary) patio overlooking Dundas Square. Dundas Square is similar to Times Square only lonelier and is often avoided by locals unless necessary for transit interchange. As a true lover of Toronto, I hate this area of the city. Toronto is so lovely when it's not trying to be New York or London, and this area is manufactured other world-class city diet piss. But, if you haven't seen it, you probably should. 

Remember to Jack Up (poof! it's a double) your drinks, order the cheesy bread and chicken fingers and buy your movie tickets before going up to the restaurant so you don't have to go all the way back down 4 escalators. Enjoy the show. 

PEPPER POINTS: For the cheesy bread. God, it's like crack soaked in heroin sprinkled with nicotine. Then topped with cheese."}
{"text":"Drinks are expensive - and as one would expect from a Jack Astor's, the entire place has a very corporate feel. The menu's alright, but there are better places around. Loose Moose is right around the corner, and is a better choice, if only slightly."}
{"text":"I like their \"we're sorry we're open\" sign.

This Jack Astor's has been opened for a long time now and I've never had a bad experience. The food quality has stayed roughly the same over the years. That being said, I was never a big fan of the food. It's just average with a higher price tag. The service is good because they have enough waiters who are usually ecstatic  to serve you. I think the choices in the menu are quite limited which is a big reason why I don't go so often.

I'm giving them a 3.5 because generally the food and service quality never deteriorated so it's a reliable choice for taking co-workers, friends and relatives."}
{"text":"OK! The good first!  This place actually has a decent atmosphere, clean, and the service is GREAT!!

Now the bad :) The food here is, well, not BAD, its just not WORTH what you pay is all.  For $13 bones Im expecting a chef back there to me making hand formed patties, fresh cut fries etc......

Instead what you get is a frozen pre-formed burger and frozen fries. NOW IM NOT saying its BAD ... Im just saying that it's A&W level food (literally!!!) at Earl's prices.

{"text":"The staff was super nice and seemed to all be in good moods socializing with all the customers. The food did not disappoint either even when we tried some of their more creative options."}
{"text":"I am no amateur when it comes to dinning at Jack Astor's Bar & Grill, in fact there is a location right next to my place of employment which I regularly head to for lunch & dinner (Dixon Rd, Etobicoke). You get it, I know the menu...so much so I should consider applying there for a second job.  Nevertheless, Rugby and I went in to pick up late dinner (10:45pm -11:00pm), since I had a soccer game at 9:30pm. 

Rugby and I ordered 2 of the Crispy Quinoa Chicken Slaw ($16.97 each) and the Tuna Poke ($12.84).  Jack's had revamped their menu, and I had yet to try these 2 items -- as you can imagine my little foodie heart was beating with excitement (could've been my famished foodie stomach gurgling too...).  Jack's being a corporate food chain is consistent with their food, always delivering great tasting plates. This particular visit was disappointing...not because of the food quality, but as a result of the food portions.  I felt cheated, especially with the Tuna Poke starter.  We received maybe 2 tablespoons for the Tuna Poke and a handful of wonton crisps - the ratio was way off, not enough poke to crisps.  The Crispy Quinoa Chicken Slaw was so flavorful, but again...I could've gotten more slaw.  The bill totaled to ~$50 (with taxes)...for the amount we received not worth it.

I'll most likely return, but I doubt I'll be ordering those dishes again."}
{"text":"$9.26 for a pint so I give a $20 bill expecting $5 in change and a $5 bill... I was given 2 five's. The waitress expected, and made it obvious she expected, a $5 tip on a $9.26 pint. Poor servers with horrible attitudes."}
{"text":"Jacks as a franchise is great but this location is by far the absolute worst.

Poor bar service where your server may come by every 40mins if your lucky and he/she isn't too busy joking around with other staff.

They make it blatantly clear that as a customer, 'we don't need you'... I get it, busy location means there's always customers but don't expect great tips with poor attitude and service."}
{"text":"Le cocktail était bon et la nourriture correcte, le normal de ce qu'on attend d'un resto. Je l'ai trouvé trop cher pour ce qui est. Au moins le service était excellent et la place est cool"}
{"text":"The original bar that opened when I was just old enough to drink - yeah...I know...it's a long time ago!  - is still alive and kicking.
There was basically nothing in the area as a fledgling Silicon North was being formed.  Money was a plenty as work was booming and silver mirror cladded buildings were being built as fast as Kevin Hart pumped out b-rated movies!
Out of nowhere, a JackAS$tors was born in what will become the current restaurant pit.  Jack, for me, was the original breastaurant...not so much now as newer slicker ones have popped up over the last decade.  
Gone today is the \"come on in and get wasted\" bar I once knew.  I use to go and make the biggest mess I could with the peanuts!  It was mass pandemonium as a Mr. Peanut massacre was played out over and over and over by patrons who could not even remember their names!  I guess that's why they got rid of it!!!???!!!
Enough of the history and reminiscing - Ahhh the good old days!  A lot may have changed but they still kept the usual formula.  Lots of Beer and food that will add Years to your Life!  On a TreadMill - Ugh!!!
This afternoon it was Fish and Chips and an Okanagan Springs 1516 Ale.  5 Stars for the ale, 2 Stars for the food.  I always have a love hate relationship with the food here.
Place was packed and Christmas celebrations were in full swing during the lunch hour.  
As I travel around different places, I classify this place the McBAR of choice.  You know there usually is one in the area and you know what you are getting.
Cheers and happy holidays!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this one when I lived nearby on Nelson street, aka Screaming-Drunk-People-Central.  The service is always great here, and the food is on par with other Jack Astor's, for the most part...depending what you order.

I took away a star because my beer glass tasted like vanilla the other day, which was terrifying and stressful!  Well no, but if anything it was weird and confusing.  Also, when you order poutine at this location it appears that they put it in a bowl first (like the other locations serve them in), but then they dump it out on a plate so that your poutine is sitting on your plate, looking at you all sad, in the shape of a bowl.  It's strange.  It's also cold in the middle.

The Jack Astor's on Front Street (by University) is better IMO.  Much better atmosphere there, no matter where you sit.  The bar area there is much more lively than the one here, which is often half empty.  This one is ok if you need somewhere to go before going next door to watch Peeta and Katniss."}
{"text":"One of the best jack Astors that are out there! Service was great and as always, so was the food. Patio is always cleaned and organized. Would definitely recommend this for a great summer spot in Pickering!"}
{"text":"4.5/5.
I used to be a regular here during my teens, but ultimately started to become an adult and had less time to go out. I came here once last year in July and it was as loud and energetic as I remember it.

However, this review is based on my latest visit - tonight. I had called to make reservations Thursday evening for Saturday evening for 2. I asked for the bar, but the bar is only first come first served. Understandable. When I arrived right on time, there was a noticable wait at the front with people waiting to be seated. There were people outside too, but I'm not sure if they were in line waiting to be seated either. When I walked in, I waited for the host to finish a phone call. Funny thing! My phone started ringing. He was calling me to see if I would be coming I guess, since I was there at the very moment my reservation was and people were waiting. We were seated in a booth in front of the kitchen. The music wasn't as loud as I remember, which I liked because man, my ears would ring sometimes when I used to come here regularly. My server was Alessia. She came over and wrote her name on the dining room paper, which was helpful for us to flag her down by name later. The menu is no longer a laminated flip-open menu. It's now a double sided piece of paper listing all their food. We ordered our drinks and an appetizer first. 

I ordered the Lobster and Crab Dip appetizer, which was my favourite dish here during my teen years. Glad it's still there! Still as good as ever. I also ordered the Perfect Cosmo, which was good...but then I ordered the Blue Raspberry Lemonade after and really wish I ordered just that instead (and Jacked it up - add 1oz for $3.33) because it was really good. I definitely recommend the Blue Raspberry Lemonade if you want to order a drink.

My main dish was the Brie Burger, and I subbed the fries for yam fries. Yam fries were good; I love their sauce there. The Brie Burger wasn't the best burger I've ever had, and especially not for that price point ($15.94). It was decent. I was so stuffed that I couldn't finish my burger. I had a glass of chardonnay sauvignon after. Alessia was very personable and easy to flag down when we wanted to order more drinks.

Overall, quality food, drinks, and service. There was one pesky fruit fly having fun flying around my food and wine, but that's the only bad thing I can say about this experience."}
{"text":"one of the best places downtown for customer service
BAR none 
i never experienced such amazing service anywhere else in the downtown core 
Highly recommended 
great food!"}
{"text":"this restaurants menu boasted that (paraphrasing here) \"former president Bill Clinton are here\" our \"party\" arrived to the front desk, when we spoke to the front staff about getting a large table set up, they asked us for how many? we replied with a number, but also said that it wasn't a \"set number\" the front end staff responded with \"well we can't set up tables randomly without a solid number\" and \"we cannot commit so many tables to be taken up, because the blue jays game will be on soon, and we are anticipating a higher volume of people\" so basically they weren't helping us...we hung out in the bar to wait for the rest of the \"group\" when everyone was finally around (group of ten) we were put in the corner of the restaurant with a bunch of Elvis bust's. i was really annoyed with the fact that we weren't put here in the first place? and second annoyed with the fact that it wasn't a very good spot to see TV's from, because surprisingly the booth section had walls that were probably 6-7 feet high, so when your sitting down, you can only see out of the entrance of the booth? SMH at this one folks...we were approached by our server(mike), and after we all ordered drinks, we asked if he should bring a round of waters...? typically you should have brought a round of waters before a word came out of his mouth...but hey different practices at the \"jack astors visited by Bill Clinton\" i was a little disturbed by how forth coming our server was with the auto tip situation, he asked us if we wanted to split our bills...which we wanted, then he brought up the auto tip situation, even tho there was bill splitting, and then asked us if this was ok? DID WE HAVE A CHOICE? why would you leave your self to cause verbal confrontation? 
i digress
after our drinks came by, we placed our respected orders for food, 20 minutes later the first rounds of food showed up, half of the first round of food that showed up was cold...so the only person in our party bothered by it, requested that it be re-heated to which the server whisked it away...only to bring it back and it still be cold...
when a majority of the food came, every \"server\" was brought over to our table so the majority of us could be served at once, which i thought was a bit odd, because each server was only carrying two plates at a time? not to mention that lets say two servers were distributing food out to the table...they were reaching and passing food over all of our friends that weren't sitting in the booth...myself included. SMH at this as well
when our food came (me and my s.o's) we both ordered a plain poutine, and my poutine was at least double the size of hers...but there was no size option? we called mike over to correct this situation, which i let my S.O. handle, she pointed out the size difference. mike cut my girlfriend off with \"oh well they use the same mold to make the poutine, so i don't understand how its a different size, it looks fine to me\". i was seething at this point, but respectfully let my s.o. handle this. my s.o. also pointed out that the gravy looked inconsistent in color, to which mike let out an exasperated sigh, and took the plate away. both of my food requests were cold, when realistically they shouldn't have been. my s.o. got her poutine back, same size as mine and piping hot. i'm not sure what kind of show he was trying to run, but maybe he needs a bit more training to handle a bigger group, or don't handle bigger groups. 
the lack of professionalism defiantly wore on me by the end of our meal, the lackluster service from all ends of this establishment, and just the general attitude of our server was some of the worst Ive witnessed. 

i would defiantly stare clear of this establishment...cause if you as a business...and maybe even narrow it down directly to the server...if you can't serve 10 people at once? you should close your doors...and that's being honest. .

i guess Bill Clinton has very low standards...

scaddabush is next door...do yourself a solid and spend your hard earned money over there...top notch service, and people who care."}
{"text":"out of all the eating establishments in the general area (boston pizza and tuckers) this place is the best of the worst. the servers/service is good, the food is sometimes a hit or miss, i still can't understand how people hand out cold food, not that i want them sticking their fingers into my food, but still! a decent amount of parking, and the restaurant is generally speaking clean. defiantly a great place to come and have some drinks and watch the game, the food however is again, a hit or a miss."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times before, but this particular review is for my last visit which was for Game 5 of the ALDS.  Ya know, the one where the Blue Jays won the ALDS for the first time in 20+ years, also known as the best game of baseball ever?! The energy in this place was absolutely incredible, especially being only a few minutes walk from the stadium.  

But even for all of the craziness, the service was fantastic! All of the waitstaff was on their A-Game and made sure the beer was flowing and the food was coming out quickly. I'm sure they brought in extra staff for the occasion, so maybe it's a testament to management, but I was very impressed!"}
{"text":"I used to love jack Astor's. Generous portions, reasonable prices, a fun place to hang out. 

Parking:
Lots of parking. C'est les suburbs people. The car is king. 

Entrance:
Weirdly facing Yonge Street. You have to walk around the building to get to it. 

Decor:
Modern. Some glimpses of the old jack Astor's with the chalk boards with funny sayings.  The bar used to be separate. Sigh I wish it still was it would be quieter at night. Low  tables, booths, high tables  seating.

Food:
Typical fare that you see at places like this, burgers, fries, pasta, pizza, a few other things like salad and whatever is the dish that is au currant every where. 

Sadly prices have gone up portions and quality have gone down. 

Pepe line up to eat here and I'm not 100% sure why. 

Oh they crank the music in the bar area so you have to tell over peoe screaming in order to be heard. Sigh."}
{"text":"Pretty good Jack Astor's location.

I liked the one in Toronto near Union Station - and this on MacLeod is quite on par. Except for the garlic bread - somehow that was better in Ontario...

Funny pictures as part of the Jack Astor's style, tons of TV screens showing crazy stuff, rather noisy but with lots of seating options. Solid and ample menu, decent selection of drinks, well-trained (though rather indifferent) servers.

Been there a few times and won't hesitate a second to visit it once again - totally worth it.

Parents - that's one of the few real pubs where you can bring kids without suffering. Additional few points for Gryffindor on that..."}
{"text":"Came here for a girls' night last week and I had a great time. They have a \"Summer Staycation Menu\" which has so many cool things to try. I had the Asian Nachos when I visited another location a month or two ago, which was fabulous!

We came in on a Wednesday and it was super busy! Guess all the students were done school/exams for the summer and decided to have dinner there. We waited for a booth and it was no longer than 3 minutes waiting time. The hostess was great, especially when we originally said we wanted the bar and then changed our mind.

To start we had waters with lemon and decided to order a couple of drinks. My girl friend ordered the Berry Lemonade and I ordered the Mo-tea-to. I wish I got her drink because it was sweet but a little bit tangy which was nice. My drink had lemon juice in it and that was all I tasted, no green tea at all :(

My girl friend ordered the Polka Poutine from their Summer Staycation Menu and I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp. I liked my Pad Thai, I thought $17.98 was a little steep but I definitely got what I paid for. The bowl was humongous! I could only eat half and packed up the rest. I was a bit conflicted on how they cooked the egg... Kind of tasted like they added flour to it, kind of batter-like. My friend's Polka Poutine was pretty tasty too but she didn't like it so much since the mayo-based sauce they had on it had a very pungent flavour, either garlic or horseradish.

The service was great and we were checked up on appropriately during our meal."}
{"text":"My friend wanted a burger and I wanted wings so this seemed like the right place to go to in the area we were at. The hostess was friendly when we arrived and seated us right away.

Our waitress was very quirky and friendly. It took a bit of time to get our drinks but I think that was largely due to the table of 8 she was also serving.

My friend got the Brie Burger with fries. He mentioned that it was bigger before but was still good. The fries were so crispy and I did not regret stealing a few from him. He also got a pint of Granville Island (I think or Barking Squirrel) and Jacked it up for about $1.29.

I got 5 hot buffalo wings for $9.96 and added a Caesar salad for $4.29. Our waitress hand tossed my wings by our table which was interesting. She mentioned they started doing that about a month ago. Their \"hot\" buffalo I feel would have been comparable as another restaurant's \"medium\" in my opinion. It was still good though and not too vinegary. She tossed it in a metal bowl and served the wings in it but I felt like it was distracting so I poured the wings out onto my plate. The carrots that were served with it were old and sad looking :( I still ate the carrot sticks though...

Anyway this location is a place that I wouldn't mind going to but it would not be my first choice as it was mediocre. The waitress really helped my experience though."}
{"text":"We live right by this Jack Astor's and love coming here for the occasional drink or dinner.   

The service is great, and the new renovations are really fantastic.   The new patio is my favourite.   I love their drink specials, and the great service from this location. 

Even on insanely busy nights with lots of families - the servers manage things well and treat every person very well.

Great neighbourhood watering hole!"}
{"text":"It only takes one bad drink or one bad meal to ruin it! It wasn't the meal ... it was the drink, I asked for no ice and my Bloody Caesar was served warm...almost fermented! I was so shocked that I asked the bartender if they chill their juice and he said no theirs no fridge room! I said If juice is left out in 48 hours it will be fermented he said he throws out the juice every night if it's used or not! I paid for my Caesar and want to comment if that's true the amount of juice thrown out every night, management may want to look into a mini fridge...for real! The place was ok! Waitress was pleasant yet also quick to order the drink without asking how I like it! A Caesar is a drink that really needs to be asked \"how do you want it\" Bruschetta appetizer was very good!"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks the other night..as a chef I tend to not eat out in chain restaurants but I thought I'd give it a go as my  associates think I'm a food snob :)  we had the wings in the Asian ginger sauce..the sauce was way too sweet and gummy the coating on the wings far too thick..decided to try a couple other items on the menu (asian) when the waitress told me its was the same sauce, just worded differently on the menu.. in total about 2/3 of the menu was bathed in the same sauce- the complete lack of imagination and variety reinforced my opinion of chain restaurants..that all the food tastes the same and nothing more than a break from the beverages..sadly for this place, I think I've converted some over to my team after this night, I'm sure if I come back next year everything will be drowning in sriracha"}
{"text":"Très bonne bouf. Nous avons essayer les nachos machos avec Chili au boeuf. Très grande assiette et excellent, pas du tout piquant (quelque piment fort ici et là). Nous étions trois, il y en manquait pas. Un must sont les bouchées de poulet avec les sauce et sel, Je pourrais mange que cela. J'ai essayé le hamburger fumée à la bbq, il était parfait. Bonne taille, boeuf cuit à point juste un peu juteux, bacon croustillant pas trop cuit, pain croustillant et moelleux. Je préfère ce Jack à celui du centropolis à Laval. Il est plus petit et surtout beaucoup moins bruyant. Si vous avez le choix entre les deux, Je vous recommande ce dernier. Sinon, le service et la bouf sont identique comme une chaîne le devrait."}
{"text":"Restaurant de type bar sportif à la cage aux sports et Barbies , Donc bruyant. Si vous voulez un tête à tête tranquille, peut être sur la terrasse malgré quel tombe sur une rue passante et près d'un grand boulevard.

Sinon pour la nourriture. J'ai essayer plusieurs chose, les hamburger, nachos, boucher de poulet, salade. J'ai pas mal tout apprécier ce que j'ai manger. Ce n'est pas de la haute cuisine mais différent tout de même des autres.

Les bouchés de poulet en entrée viennent avec 3 sauce et 3 sel. Vraiment bon. Par contre je trouve toujours que le bol de poulet est vide pour le prix.

Comme plusieurs resto, les portions tendent à descendre et les prix monter, faire plus de profit comme on dit. Reste que ça remplis quand même bien.

L'ambiance est bruyante mais aussi drôle. Les serveurs ont tous des chandail avec des phrases drôle en arrière. Il y à une rotation en plus donc ce n'est pas toujours les mêmes. Les tables ont une nap en papier et des crayons sont là pour dessiner, même certains oeuvres sont afficher. Plusieurs tableaux drôle et amusant.

Sans l'ensemble, un bonne place pour sortir avec des amis."}

{"text":"For whatever reason... I have been here 4 times in the last two weeks... Football` games, nacho cravings, needed a beer desperately after being in the mall for two hours.  
They have good beer, good service, good nachos.... ;)   It's your fairly standard chain restaurant... nothing wow about the place, but still recommended.  
One thing though... if you plan on watching a large sports event here, you need to be facing the bar, or else you need to squint to look at the way off small TVs.  Watching the football game, I literally had the watch the game directly behind me, which wasn't so great.  
In summary... this place is A-okay, good for a beer or two and some food.  
I will however give them an A+ on dealing with kids... there are crayons, and birthday songs, and they are quick to remedy a situation where there are tears with a little one (\"Oh, you don't like the orange sherbert... let me get you a chocolate chip cookie ASAP\")"}

Premièrement ce fut par hasard et non prémédité. deuxièmement, les frites étaient tellement ennuyantes... aucune saveur. Troisièmement, l'eau était imbuvable. Dernièrement, la serveuse nous a enlevé les assiettes à moitiés consommées. Nous a-t-elle demandé si nous avions terminé? Oui. Notre réponse : non pas encore. sa réponse : \"Ok je vous apporte les factures\" en partant avec les assiettes. Juste écrire cette review ça me fait ch*er. Come on girl. Même si t'es nouvelle me semble que t'enlève pas la bouff aux clients après 15 minutes, surtout s'ils te disent qu'ils n'ont pas terminé. le bon côté : elle était ben ben fine..."}
{"text":"I've been to this John St. locations numerous times as we live nearby, usually sit inside upstairs or outside in the patio if the weather is nice. My last visit was on July 1, 2017, which happens to be Canada Day and the restaurant's supposedly really busy. We came at 7:30 p.m. with a group of 9, and simply asked how long it is for a table outside/inside. The hostesses standing out front (there were 2 girls) were very rude and gave us an attitude. She said it will be at least 2 hours, more like 4 hours. I get that it's busy, but there were multiple tables empty out front, we even asked if we can split the group into 2 tables, they said there's no way, as there is a 2 hour minimum wait. We asked why they weren't filling the empty tables out front, didn't get a clear answer and we were told that the kitchen's really busy and can't handle it. How do you have a restaurant with such capacity, but can't manage to handle a busy day? it's not the first day that the area's busy, there's always games. Not only that, when we asked why, she rudely answered \"I\"m done answering questions. If you want a table, it's going to be at least 2 hours.\" After that comment, which is very rude, given that we only asked a few reasonable Q's, we immediately went across the street to Milestones to dine in their patio. We were seated in 3 minutes. I've had decent meals at John location, but this last visit was a really upsetting and disappointing experience. A rude hostess is not a good image. They're responsible for first impressions."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Saturday night to see the place wasn't super packed. Nice cool vibe, good music playing. Our waitress was attentive and super sweet ! The fishbowl drink was DELICIOUS! And our food was even better. We ordered pad Thai with chicken and sesame chicken with rice and vegetables. Didn't expect it to be so good but it was. Super delicious. Will definitely  be back whenever I'm in Toronto again !"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by for lunch on a Monday afternoon. The place was not crowded, and the weather was so beautiful we could enjoy sitting on the patio. We were able to share one Of their delicious fishbowl drinks and ordered their fried chicken sandwich and cheeseburger deluxe. Everything including the service from the waitress was up to par. Lovely place ! Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Another grrreat experience at Jack's! I said I'd be back to try the Jack Louis which is Jack's take on the Joe Louis and that was my main reason for returning tonight. But before we get to dessert I'll give you a run down of my whole meal that night.

Tonight we dined inside because it was a rainy day outside.

For drinks I was feeling non alcoholic so I went with my favourite virgin drink there the Sparkling Lemonade... no hanky panky here just straight up refreshing lemonade slightly sweeter today and bubbly as usual.

For apps we decide to for go the traditional garlic pan bread and opted for something different...the roasted garlic bruschetta. Diced roma tomatoes, red onions, roasted garlic and fresh basil, served on fresh-baked Italian bread. Topped with big crumbles of Feta and Parmesan Romano cheeseand drizzled with garlic aioli and a balsamic glaze. Its a definite must have if your tired of there garlic bread!

For mains I was craving something meaty so went for the butter brushed sirloin steak. I must say I was completely blown away by the quality of there steak. A nice hearty chunk of meat cooked perfectly medium rare, nice and tender and seasoned perfectly.....I was pleasantly surpised that a bar & grill could turn out such an awesome piece of meat! 

And finally the part of the meal I've been waiting for all night long.......the Jack Louis! Which is basically a Joe Louis Jacked Up. It consisted of a fresh baked red velvet louis sandwiching a luscious fluffy cream cheese icing drenched in a warm Bailey's chocolate sauce drizzled with vanilla icing. Absolutely mind blowlying delicious and much larger than a regular Joe Louis. Definitely worth the wait and a must try. I washed that down a hot cup of of Joe.....they serve Seattle's Best Coffee at Jacks.

Overall spectactcular Meal. No Complaints. Try the Jack Louis for Dessert....you will Not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am totally in Love with this Jack's Location!

What I particularly Love about this Jack's is that they have fun monthly events. Check out there facebook page or subscribe to there VVIP club for great deals and get the scoop on upcoming events and promos.

The last 2 events I went to they were giving away free bottles of beer and glasses of wines. Every year they celebrate there Anniversary at this location which falls sometime in October. They had a live dj and lots of free apps and desserts as well giveaways and prizes.

Service is always top notch here I never have any complaints! They have a cute patio that looks onto to yonge.

Now jacks is serving up Starbucks Coffee (they were already serving Tazo teas). They have also introduced 2 new dessert items

The Cracker Jack Sundae - Caramel popcorn and candied peanuts served over vanilla ice cream and drizzled with caramel sauce. I wasn't a fan of this because I hate carmel but i loved the candied peanut in it!

The Smores Sundae - Marshmallows, graham cracker and brownie bits topped with whipped cream over vanilla ice cream and drenched in our signature Baileys chocolate sauce. I loved this Sundae! Soo many different textures, crunch from the graham, chewy from the marshmellow, silky hot fudge, and the cool ice cream. Perfect Combo!

My all time favourite Sandwich here is the Le Montreal Special - Slices of Montréal smoked meat, piled high, topped with deli mustard. Served with a pickle spear. Its on toasted marble rye and they never skimp on the meat! 

What I also like about Jack's is that they have monthly feature menu that introduces new items and uses seasonal ingredients so there is always something new to try!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly & fast service. Delicious Pan roasted garlic bread that I would die for. The only problem is their pasta isn't very good, neither are their nachos. Their fries are delicious though, and I've heard their burgers are really good too(I'm a vegetarian)."}
{"text":"A huge thanks to the sever here....she helped us with our Vegan choices!! Awesome to have a choice that is not fries or a salad.

The Fajita Bowl without the feta and tofu was amazing
Nachos with guacamole!!! Delish
Sweet potato fries too!!"}
