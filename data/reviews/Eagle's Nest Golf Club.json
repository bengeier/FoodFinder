{"text":"I recently attended a corporate golf event at Eagle's Nest and my experience was pleasant.    We rented out the facility for 9-hole pro-am in the morning followed by a shotgun tournament in the afternoon.  The golf staff was incredible to work with.  They were there when our event coordinator needed them and were pretty quick to respond when we needed something (extra table, chairs, etc).   The Course looked good, and our players really enjoyed themselves.  It was hot out today and it would have been nice to have had some more water jugs or coolers out on the course for our guests.    Budget restraints dictated our food selections for our reception, but our food stations of pub food went fast!  Overall we had a great event there at a beautiful venue."}
{"text":"It was the Summer of 2009, Caribbana to be specific. Some of my friends had worked to organize a fantastic golfing fundraiser for the Caribbana weekend which was to be held at the Eagles Nest. Pro-golfers were coming and paying thousands of dollars to play at the event. There were even some members of the club (who I'm going to mention now were Caucasian and you'll see where I'm going with that in a minute).   My friend who is a very successful (and well-paid) event planner and fundraiser had been having problems with the club as far as the negotiations for the event were concerned prior to the event date. Although the venue was booked, the Eagles Nest kept increasing the fees she needed to pay which later she concluded were because they figured that she would be unable to come up with the funds. And why was that? Well, read on.  When we all showed up for the event (and may I remind you that it was a Caribbana event!) we were not allowed on the property. My friends' car (and I in it) were informed that the fee had not been paid and that the event had been cancelled by the club. My friend immediately called her sister who had planned it and she was at the front door arguing with the manager. It turned out they just didn't want black people on their course!!!!! Why the heck would they have booked a CARIBBANA event?!   We all refused to leave of course and the pro-golfers started rolling in (many influential and wonderful people). So a summation of our day? Racist slurs were yelled at us, someone who worked there LITERALLY tried to run us over with a golf cart and was laughing about it. The individuals who had previously held memberships there, withdrew them and not until words were exchanged with the manager. And the best part? It was caught on camera because we had a crew there to film the event.  I don't know what they ever did with the footage, but I do know one thing. If you go to the Eagles Nest, you are going to a golf course that represents inequality and racism.   I only wish I could give this place a -5 stars."}
{"text":"Came here for a staff event and was in one of the meeting rooms on the second floor. The lookout to the golfcourse is stunning. The resident catering company Lago serves delicious pastries as well as their hot catered lunch menu. The butternut squash soup, bruschetta and the white sauce cannolini were delicious.  I'm not a golfer so can't comment on the golf course. The location is very high end and looks like a great location to host parties and weddings."}
{"text":"I've played the course and been here for a wedding.  The banquet hall/clubhouse is beautiful with a stunning view of the 18th.  The food is mediocre, but I've yet to go to a wedding where the food would be more than 3 stars - come on now, you're feeding 150+ people at once.  The golf is ridiculous.  Even an experienced golfer would have a good challenge.  400+ yard par 4s, crazy ondulations, elevation changes, deep bunkers everywhere and water hazards.  A cool view of Toronto from one of the holes, complete with binoculars.  If you're playing off the tips, there is a par 5 that's 650 yards.  I'm an average golfer at best and probably lost close to a dozen balls.  Normally I'd complain, but it was worth it.  Ate at the clubhouse after and the nachos and service were great.  Pro-tip:  Regular green fees range from $120 to $195 (ouch).  You can easily snag a twilight time off golfnow for $70."}
{"text":"Wow, I must say I was impressed! This golf course is absolutely beautiful. I was there for a friend's wedding shower and everything was spectacular! The food was to die for! We were there for brunch so I was expecting something small but boy was I wrong! We were in a party room with a long table to the right when we came in. The decor and ambience was perfect! It was very elegant and I can see why alot of weddings are hosted here. The food was like dinner portion! I got the calamari for app and sirloin for lunch! The steak was cooked to perfection and the brussel sprouts and veggies on the side were superb! Im normally a big eater and this was alot! My stomach only had room for a tiny dinner at night! There is a nice bar there as well and it was all you can drink for lunch! If this is just for lunch, I don't even know how good diner will be! The desserts were scrumptious. After lunch and inbetween, we went outside to take some pics and the view was gorgeous! Would love to come back here again...or maybe even Plan a wedding here :)"}
{"text":"Flew from LA to go to this venue for a family wedding. Quick summary: beautiful golf course and banquet hall. Decent but not fantastic food. Service was average. Parking isn't a hassle  I've been to multiple country clubs in LA, but the scenery at this golf club really stands out. Conditions were perfect: grass was well kept, a lake overlooking the sunset mixed with bunkers, hills and a few trees made this course a unique blend of British links golf and Canadian wilderness. The scenery is the highlight of this establishment.  Interior of the banquet hall was modern and beautiful. Bathrooms were clean and had mouthwash and lotion- typical fancy amenities.   Food was okay. We got a three course meal. Garden salad, steak and salmon, creme brûlée and cake. Salad wasn't anything special, no dressing just some walnuts and strawberries. Steak was a bit overcooked. Salmon was okay but lacked flavor. Best part was the dessert. Creme brûlée was my favorite and I would highly recommend it for anyone who decides to do an event here. They also served an odd red velvet cake which was uneven, some parts were salty and others were sour (I don't know if that was a Canadian thing).   Service was okay. Everyone was accommodating but they were understaffed. Had to wait a while to get orders in.  Overall, you really pay for the scenery at this place. The food was pretty mediocre but you get to take some awesome pictures"}
{"text":"I just recently attended a wedding reception at Eagles Nest which turned out to be awesome. The whole country club is very upscale and well maintained.    We had a full three course meal and even with a couple of hundred people there, everyone more or less got their food at the same time. The servers and bartenders were very accommodating and ready to help you at any moment.   It was pretty cold and damp outside so we didn't golf. Can't comment there."}
{"text":"I had my company Christmas party here and the venue was fantastic! A great view over looking the golf course for the party and the staff were courteous and accommodating.   This maybe true for most banquet halls but the food was alright. The roast beef was tasty but everything else lacked flavor and seasoning. The Fish was over cooked to the point where it looked like a bun."}
{"text":"Absolutely stunning golf course. This is a links course and the bunkers are 7feet deep!!! Incredible!! Very tough course which keeps bringing me back time after time!  Well groomed and fantastic holes.   I really do wish they had gps in the carts. But most people have them on their watch or phone so this is not something that a lot of people would wish."}
{"text":"I'm not a golfer, so my review is strictly from the perspective of food and service.  I came here for a large group dinner. We had a large private room and it was nice. Great view, comfortable, a little old. But over all, the place has a nice rustic charm to it.   The food is mediocre. The service is poor. Very friendly staff, but they just haven't been trained well - it's purely  a management issue.  Some reasons why: 1) The food is not complex, it's very simple and just put together.  2) The cuts are inconsistent. You get large pieces, small pieces, really horrible prep on MEP. 3) Server's are directed to bring out same type dishes all at once per course. So if you order an antipasto, expect to wait 10 minutes before everyone else at the table receive their salad, pasta's, etc. This is diner style service. 4) Clearing is very haphazard. No consistency coming in on the left, stacking plates, picking up things and asking you to pass things.    I'm not trying to be pretentious here.  If this was a $20 meal, i would think nothing of this. But this was an expensive meal and i expect that at that price point, someone in upper management should hire a proper restaurant and kitchen manager with a good fine dining background."}
{"text":"This is a review for the Sunday brunch only.  I've been to Eagle's Nest several times for the weekend brunch buffer. Overall the food is pretty good. In terms of what's being offered, they are not always consistent. Sometimes there is more selection, sometimes less. It may depend if it's a special holiday. To be honest, I haven't been able to detect the pattern. But there were times that the spread was quite generous and impressive.   Besides the buffet items, there also is usually a roast beef station, an omelette station, and a large selection of pretty tasty deserts. I find that they may be lacking in fish selection. Overall, I would say that the food is not too bad, considering that brunch can be hit and miss.  In terms of the decor, the place is quite elegant. It's especially nice looking in the summer when Golf season is in full swing. I guess you could make your way straight from the brunch onto the course, and blame your poor swing on the mimosa you just had."}
{"text":"Was here for a wedding. The polite staff, venue and jaw dropping scenery is bound to be Instagram worthy! Had a sufficient amount of parking spots. Would highly recommend this venue for any large events!"}
{"text":"Came here recently for a friends birthday and DAMN...I mean, I drive by Eagle's Nest pretty often but I never thought I would feel so bougie attending an event here. The birthday took place downstairs at the pub, there was a wedding happening on the main floor but everything was organized so perfectly that we didn't see any conflicts occur amongst the two events.   The catering company prepared a good variety of snacks, all in cute little plates that we could efficiently carry as we mingled around the pub. There was mac and cheese, nachos, wings and a few dips. The servers in charge of the catering were also supper friendly and accommodating, they prepared a special dish of nachos for my friend who is lactose intolerant ( NACHOS INCLUSIVITY YAS).   Although it was dark, you could still see the beauty of the golfcourse when you stepped out of the building. The pub itself was super spacious and the employees quickly cleaned up after everyone so the space was neat and clean the entire night. Everyone enjoyed their time there and the staff worked really hard to maintain a classy environment, AND THAT alone did a solid four star job for me :)"}
