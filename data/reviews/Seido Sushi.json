{"text":"Great service and sushi! Cheap as well with some of the best sushi happy hours I have seen"}
{"text":"The service and the food were great. Will bring my family back again and would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Terrible. Dirty. Poor quality sushi. They forget your rolls and charge you before you get a chance to say hey we still have food we're waiting on... I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Okay first time here and I don't know how I have lived without this place. I never give 5 stars. Denim is the best waiter too."}
{"text":"If you love Sushi, you're at the right place. Seido sets the curb with an excellent sellection of rolls at great prices. They range from mild-to-wild with over 50 to choose from, those with an adventurous appetite would adore trying each of the 50 state rolls. It should be known that rolls are filling and quite big, none of that nonsense most local sushi restaurants attempt. I usually order 2 and am quite stuffed. There is no grand amounts of \"filler\" for the rolls like rice or minced crabstick. Each roll is genuine on its own. You get big nuggets of fish in each bite, depending on which roll you order. I recommend the Washington, North Dakota, Massachusetts and Louisiana!  One thing to note which always has me coming back is the expert handle of tempura this location offers. Its clean, crisp and mild taste puts Seido's cuisine in a class all its own. Also, If you want a bit of everything (rolls, tempura, and more) Try the Dinner Special Seido offers. Its a reasonable price for the amount of food you get, perfect for a couple to share. Give this location a chance. You'll become a regular in no time! Don't forget to ask for fresh wasabi. Its this locations best kept secret if you really want a kick in each bite."}
{"text":"Formerly K Sushi, I tried Seido tonight and enjoyed the service and the meal.  I ordered the 8 piece sushi combo and the 6 piece veggie tempura.   The veggie tempura is a great deal ($3.25). They said 6 pieces, but the portions are large: 2 broccoli florets, a large slice of carrot, acorn squash, asparagus and onion ring. They were battered and fried to perfection. The tempura sauce was a little too sweet for my palette, and it was not served with grated radish.  The sushi was decent. They gave me 2 pieces of snapper, 1 piece of yellowtail (hamachi), 2 pieces of fatty salmon, unagi or grilled eel with sauce, white tuna and tuna (maguro). The nigiri sushi was sliced well with little to no gristle. The California roll I chose instead of the spicy tuna was made with rice cooked well, but a little unevenly rolled. It still tasted good and held up to my son's standards when I brought him leftovers.  On my way out, the chef/owner (Mr. Lee) was so nice and gave me a 10% off my next visit.   Check out their Happy Hour prices. The tempura was on their HH appetizer menu!"}
{"text":"Wow !!! Very nice hole in the wall almost missed it .. went in I hate taking chances at sushi places .. this one hit the spot . Big portions ... the food tasted great . I want to thank you sushi bar for the excellent food .. I will come in now for happy hour ..."}
{"text":"We come here often and we Never have bad service here.  Amazing sushi and great prices, and great happy hr. Definitely must try the Denny Roll, and if you like spice but not that much try the Arizona roll."}
{"text":"Our family of 14 gathered at this neighborhood establishment to celebrate our niece's graduation. My brother in law is a frequent customer, but for my family and I, it was our first experience. The waiter, Denim, was excellent! Great customer service and made sure our entire party was taken care of. I am not a fan of sushi, so I tried the Sesame Honey Chicken dish that came with miso soup and white rice. The appearance and taste were excellent. Everyone at our table seemed to enjoy their food whether it was from their giant sushi state menu or from the Japanese classics. The only downside, which I get when you have a large party, is my husband was the last to receive his entree by about 10 minutes from everyone else's who gradually came out. The soup and salads came after we already had our meal. For future, try to bring the entree's out all together because it is really testing to NOT eat your delicious food while waiting for everyone else's to arrive ;)"}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is the best I've had and the staff is fast and friendly I will definitely be coming back, not often you get this quality for this price"}
{"text":"These reviews are crazy.  Got edamame, salmon roll, eel roll, beef bento and spicy chicken entree.  Edamame was watery but what else is new, that happens a lot.   The rolls had 1:6 meat to rice ratio. They fell apart. This is off happy hour menu but still comes down to 5$ per roll and you can get some GREAT rolls at 5$ at other places.  The bento is during lunch hours but you pay 3$ more to have it outside of those hours. Which we did but I'm thinking it's the same size as lunch portion because it was really small. Nothing stood out about it. Bf said beef was simply \"okay\". The truly most negative thing that I saw was the tempura veg was incredibly greasy.  My spicy chicken was barely touched. Dried square pieces of chicken coated with a sauce. Sauce cant hide everything.  Last is service. They are obviously short handed. I thought it was just unlucky case of people calling in sick but I think its ongoing cause they having HIRING signs. Our server did not check on us once after dropping off our food except to plop  a to go box and the check down. I didn't even ask for a box but he must have seen at some point my uneaten plate.  I am not sure about the bento box but I believe my entree should have soup, salad or one of it. Never got it. I wanted to ask about it but a guest was being rude to the server cause he was still waiting on soup. The server said they only had a little lady back there so I didn't want to add to it.  Overall I can't return here. Even if they had five more servers, the quality of the food was one of the most disappointing I've ever experienced. I'm not a food snob (I don't give 1 star reviews!!) but wished we stayed home hungry instead."}
{"text":"in that area, I was expecting a run down restaurant, and it kinda is, and I was expecting a not-so-great- area, and it is, and I was expecting okay food, and I was completely wrong.  The sushi was beautiful and delicious (as per my wife, I don't eat that stuff)  I had the beef yakisoba and Wow!  Huge portion and so good!  so to recap:  location - ick restaurant - older but very very clean food - amazing"}
{"text":"Best Las Vegas Roll! Try the Spicey Ramen noodle bowl. Portions are large and the prices are great!"}
{"text":"First time to this semi new sushi spot. Very good, amazing staff. Water constantly refilled. Very quick food both sushi and kitchen. I had the Arizona and Mississippi roll. My husband had gyoza and a beer. I give this restaurant 5 stars for service and food. I only wish there were less rice on the sushi rolls. I would have ordered another, but I was too full to eat any more. Next time I'll be trying other things with my 10% off coupon the owner gave us during our visit. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Good stuff, I enjoyed the rolls,spicy chicken,bomb rice... only thing that I have a problem with is a bit pricey.. but really good food"}
{"text":"At my favorite sushi restaurant. I had the Calamari Tempora. Very delicate. Not chewy. Miso is always good. Didnt have sushi today but instead had the Seared Tuna Salad. Food is great. Service is great. Prices are fair."}
{"text":"Sushi is so good here! And price is even better! Costumer Service is great but sometimes slow. I believe the owner hours around giving the kids free ice cream which is so sweet is him."}
{"text":"I have never had a poor experience here (formerly K Sushi), and always love what I order.  The food is consistently fresh and the staff is always welcoming and kind."}
{"text":"Seido Sushi restaurant has a relaxing atmosphere. The staff was very kind and prompt. The food came in a timely manner and was delicious!  We had spring roles and miso soup as appetizers. I must say I had miso soup at other restaurants that were too salty or bitter, but Seido Sushi's miso soup was perfect. My mom ordered the sushi special and enjoyed every bite! I had the beef lunch box which came with tempura vegetables, salad, california rolls, thin sliced beef and rice. Again, at some restaurants I've ate at in the past, the tempura would be too oily and here it was amazingly crispy. I loved how flavorful the beef and salad were, too. We truly enjoyed our meal and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND others to come and enjoy what this restaurant has to offer!   ????????????????????????????????. (I am learning Japanese, so please excuse my mistakes.)"}
{"text":"I checked out Seido Sushi on a weekday around 5 or so. It wasn't too busy at this time so our food came out really fast! We were greeted immediately as we walked in and had a great waitress. Our food was not only delicious but also had a lovely presentation. I always like to order the tempura veggies at Japanese restaurants but hate when they come out too greasy, this was not a problem at all at Seido Sushi because they were just perfect. Our rolls were a nice size and dessert (tempura cheesecake, my favorite) was great!  No complaints here, definitely going back again soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely some of the best sushi ever! Prices vary very responsible. Was hesitant to go in from the looks outside. Inside was just old school but very clean. Sosa was the best ever! So freakin good at his job. I highly recommended this place!"}
{"text":"Been going on and of to this spot over 10 years now . It is always been a sushi place but for last 6 years changed 5 or 6 owners/ managements and almost each time it went deeper and deeper down. The only exception was when it was \"Ksushi\" that time we where eating there at least once a month.  Recently it changed owner again and I checked reviews ant they were pretty good so me and my mom went for dinner. It was one of the worst sushi dinner ever.  I don't know where all the good reviews r coming from. The service was terribly slow ( but I can understand that, and it wasn't servers fault) cause there was only one server at present ( already tiered and kind of grumpy) and it was a happy hour.  Food was very bad: deep fried spring rolls and gyoza was very very greasy. The rice in our sushi was so hard it tasted like yesterday left overs or plastic. My Las Vegas roll ( fried one) had a hard crust of fried rice around it, that was impossible to eat with very small amount of fish in it.  The only good think I can say about them they did made my sushi without cream cheese ( I don't eat milk products)  Place is also over priced even on happy hour and happy hours rolls r smaller than regular ones.  I guess I will wait and see for new owner to take over this place again,before I will come back."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. My and my friend decided to go for lunch and when we were done writing down the order the waiter came and starting confirming the order. My friend put the pencil down on the table and the waiter demanded to \"To put the pencil back\". We looked at him confused like we're not your employees we're your customers. And he told my friend \"No like put the pencil back where the sugar is because we're short on pencils and our sharpener broke\" in a very disrespectful voice. I've been coming here for a year and to experience this was ill feeling. I hope the manager talks to him. Not going back again. The food was good. Just not the culture."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Used to frequent this place when it was K Sushi. They recently changed owners, hence the new name. I must say, there's a noticeable improvement with the service. It's much more friendly and prompt. They kept the amazing happy hour food and drink menu, a huge plus! New owner came by with a discount card for our next visit. Delicious food here is always on point, hefty portions worth sharing. I really like this place."}
