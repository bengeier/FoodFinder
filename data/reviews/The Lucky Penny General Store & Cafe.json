{"text":"Great shop, a bit of everything. Excellent coffee, chicken panini is fantastic and I can do my grocery shopping. Oh, and I know the owner, she's the best thing about the place."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the negative reviews for Lucky Penny because after my first visit, I was smitten. I think they must have made some improvements since they opened because I had a great time.  First off - their patio is amazing. Filled with deck chairs, side tables and huge umbrellas, it was only half-full on a Saturday in the summer so we had plenty of space. My boyfriend got the grilled cheese sandwich which he said was one of the best he'd ever had. (I tasted it and I think the secret ingredient might just be butter.) I got a donut and an iced coffee and both were great. I think it's become a neighbourhood staple as I saw a lot of families dropping by to get ice cream. It added to the charm of the place. So overall, I really look forward to going back. The prices weren't cheap but pretty much on par with a similar place like that in the city (i.e. Mabels). I did notice that they sell Glory Hole Donuts for cheaper than at the actual location so their mark-up can't be too insane.  Stop by and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"The Lucky Penny us a great little corner store near Trinity Bellwoods Park. They sell a variety of tasty pre-made food, including salads, baked goods, and sandwiches, along with a nice small selection of groceries, including fresh produce, meat, and cheese. They even serve ice cream and coffee and have a selection of kitchen essentials. Of course you do pay a bit of a price premium shopping at a smaller place, but the staff is very friendly and the products are high quality, including a decent amount of locally sourced items. If you are in the area you should definitely stop in."}
{"text":"There are some really good things and really bad things about this place.  On the positive side, the Lucky Penny carries Glory Hole donuts and Blackbird Baking breads.  They have a good assortment of cheeses, cured meats and beverages in their fridge, as well as some fancy canned goods.    The real downer of this place is the food.  I have purchased sandwiches three times.  The first time, I got a veggie sandwich that was totally stale.  I gave them another try and bought a smoked salmon bagel, which was totally great.  But then I got another one, and it was totally stale - the bagel was at least two days old.  The sandwiches are pre-made and sitting in a fridge, but are not in plastic wrap or anything like that.  Maybe that's why they get stale.  But I really don't think it's cool to give me a super old, super stale bagel."}
{"text":"Cute shop, filled with a million different things.  Randomly walking by (that's my theme!) and saw a sign for Kawartha ice cream.  Got a double scoop in a cup.  One was cherry, the other ... raspberry?....can't really remember but both were delicious.  A nice off-the-beaten path place, really cool concept.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ignore the bad reviews, this little corner shop imports all of their foods daily and fresh from well loved Toronto based companies, including bread from Blackbird, st urbain bagels (st Lawrence market) and Fred's bread, glory hole donuts (parkdale), sanagans meat locker (Kensington), pilot coffee roasters, and more. They also have tons of sandwich options and are flexible with milk for drinks...soy, almond, etc. It may be a bit pricey but you are supporting a local independently own business as well as the local buisnesses the lucky penny orders from. Stop by!"}
{"text":"Great little neighbourhood spot! They have really settled into the space and have a nice selection of prepared and fresh foods. They sell a yummy organic green juice that I buy a lot. Nice patio and recently veggies and herbs for sale outside in the front. Coffee is so so. Sammys are great as are the salads. Friendly service. A neighbourhood gem!"}
{"text":"Cute store, lots of stuff, organic local produce.   But look it I don't look forward to paying 20 dollars for a sandwich and a salad. I can get a mountain of food for that price, and I get it on an actual plate. The food is good, but not that good.   A chicken Caesar is 17 dollars I've had cheaper better salads at steak restaurants.   But, there's no little options in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"Prepare to pay what I would consider to be a somewhat higher than normal price for a sandwich but note that they are very tasty sandwiches with high quality ingredients and cheerful staff.  Have tried both the breakfast brioche sandwich and their grilled cheese and greatly enjoyed them both.  They do also run the cafe across the street at Artscape but know that if you show up at the Artscape cafe after 11:30am on a weekday (and on some days that may be pushing it) about the only thing your are going to be able to get is the Kale panini and the soup and personally I greatly dislike Kale.  Wish they would stock the Artscape cafe better or run more stock over if they run out of options (they only have  3) prior to lunch."}

Did I say cute and did I say bagels?   This General store, cafe, produce stand fills a need in the nabe (I just fulfilled a Yelp cliche with that phrase), and living around the corner all my sundry problems are solved!"}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to come here for a while. I could finally try this very cute general store the other day for a cup of coffee after visiting the art gallery across the street. This tiny store was very very crowded in the hot early-summer afternoon during the long weekend. So crowded indeed that I could hardly move around. However the customers kept coming in. $6+ for a small affogato in a paper cup under this environment was rather disappointing. They have a small but beautiful back yard. It seemed they had good local clientele. Too bad it's too crowded to feel relaxed at all."}
{"text":"We had Sunday breakfast here. It's cozy and nice. Staff are friendly. Panini is basic but healthy. Not bad for a bite."}
{"text":"Cute. Cute cute cute.   Olde time-y general store with all of your needs, plus bagels, breads, pastries, sandwiches and nice knickknacks.   I enjoyed a toasted sesame bagel from here yesterday, and I'm probably going to pop in again this morning. A great one stop shop!   Cute. cute cute cute."}
