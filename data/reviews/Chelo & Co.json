{"text":"As a Persian  who is extremely picky about my food in the downtown core, I mean it when I say this is a GREAT spot. I had the koobideh and joojeh, wrapped in bread. So delicious. The maast was also done right! For anyone complaining about prices... First of all, it's not expensive lol at ALL. secondly, wait till u see how much food you actually get... It's worth it for sure.  Only complaint I have is the tahdig!! Was way too hard and thick. If the restaurant owners see this, please make it thinner and softer! Lol. Great place overall. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The eggplant wrap was AMAZING. Really great lunch or takeout place. The bread and humus was totally noteworthy."}
{"text":"Best persian food takeout in the downtown area... 5 star service, 4 star food quality... Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff and amazing kebabs! Chicken barley soup is a must order. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"We had Chelo delivered last night. We started with falafel and Mast-o-Esfenage and ordered the ghormeh sabzi and Baghali Polo & Mahicheh for mains. The falafels were a little on the dry side but the rest of the options were great! Generous portions given the price and delivery came earlier than expected. We'll definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"I've just had the koobideh wrap so far but by the taste of that item alone I can tell this place is legit.  The spices were just right.  Probably one of the best wraps I've ever had.  Very excited to go back and try other items and definitely recommend to those living in the area!"}
{"text":"Finally, a much needed Persian restaurant near the core! The staff is always so friendly and the food is consistently awesome. Portion sizes are big and food is served quickly. They also offer delivery through Just Eat. I hope they expand into a sit down restaurant soon!"}
{"text":"I was here a week ago. Food has authenticity. Delicious. Price wonderful. Sadlly its more than a take out than a sitting restaurant although there is a sitting area."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I've been to the Middle East and had food in home kitchens there. The food here is almost as good but the best I've had in North America for sure."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here. I've tried a few of the wraps and one of the stews (forgive me, I don't know the Persian names, but I've tried both the beef tenderloin and brisket...I liked the tenderloin Caesar the best). The stew I had (recommended by the very friendly counter person) ended up being two meals for me because the portions were so generous.  If you need quick food with quality inputs and interesting flavours, try it out."}
{"text":"Friendly staff great good! Got the koobideh and herb stew. Both were delicious and good portions. Will definitely be returning for some tasty Persian food"}
{"text":"I got the falafel. It was huge. I actually thought I wouldn't finish it. But I powered through and ate it all. Dee-licious. The price was right considering the amount I got. Good people watching window too."}
{"text":"So great this place!  This is one of my favourite takeout spots in the area.  I'm a flexitarian but eat the occasional lamb. The lamb shank here is great. A very generous portion of meat cooked in a great assortment of spices. Tender and delicious.  I love that they have lots of great veg options as well.  I just had their lentil soup and hummus wrap. Something I would make at home for myself if I had the time, desire and ingredients... which this evening I had none of. It wasn't oversalted, the wrap had lots of veggies, the wrap was huge, the soup wasn't watered down, it was  thick and full of ingredients. So happy this place is close by! As a bonus, the owner is super friendly and clearly loves her work. Definitely recommend it to anyone looking for something filling and tasty to-go!"}
{"text":"Order take out or eat in at this place! Chelo&co Persian cuisine. We were walking along queen st w and came across this little gem of a place with delicious succulent beef tenderloin marinated in yogurt, onions, salt and pepper \"kebab barg\", which came with house \"shirazi\" salad, addictive saffron white rice, grilled tomato and yummy yogurt sauces.  Also pictured is their sweet and succulent \"fesenjoon\" chicken in tangy pomegranate molasses and walnut sauce.  I'm surprised how much I liked eating their rice! I never eat rice haha."}
{"text":"Great little spot to get some delicious and seemingly healthy food. Glad I found this gem in the hood!"}
{"text":"This place is not bad in terms of quality. The spot itself is very small so there is not much room to sit..really more of a take out kinda place. The food is good quality albeit overpriced for the quantities you receive."}
{"text":"I had a big delivery ordered with Chelo and Co. It was on time and well organized. Three different wraps Koobideh, Chengeh and Chicken all were amazing."}
{"text":"Was craving persian food and ordered delivery through foodora. It was a cold and super windy night so the delivery took a little longer but it wasn't bad.  Now I've had better Persian food but this place did hit the spot. I ordered the qormeh sabzi and beef kabobs. Both were great. The meats were moist and  flavourful.  My issue is the price for the amount of food. The meat on the kabobs didn't look like much... It was enough for me but good thing I has the stew or else it wouldn't be enough for someone like myself with a \"healthy\" appetite!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out online from Chelo & Co one evening.  First, the email confirmation indicated that our food would arrive the next day at lunchtime. After phoning the restaurant twice to find out whether outer food was coming - they said it was - they then phoned us back asking if we wanted our food 'tonight'. We said yes.   Second, when we finally got our food over an hour later, it was terribly disappointing. The chicken was dry and flavourless, and there were only three small pieces. The lamb shank was not bad, but again there was hardly anything to it.   Not cheap either."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place accidentally and glad I did. Nutritious, delicious, quick and cheap! A rare combination. Had lentil soup. It was delish!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my time here. It's primarily a takeout restaurant with limited seating inside. The inside is small but has a modern, clean look and feel.  The staff/owner was super friendly and really nice. We got to sample their other stews as well.  We ordered a variety of dishes to share. I recommend trying the yummy lamb shank made in a tomato sauce served with dill basmati rice and lima beans. The dill wasn't over powering and nicely complemented the lamb. The meat was juicy and tender. The delicious tomato sauce was served on the side. The cucumber salad was nice refreshing.  Grilled eggplant with egg, herbs, tomato, and garlic was also delicious. Came with a flat bread.   Least favourite was the beef kabob with rice. But I liked the dill garlic sauce and the Greek yogurt sauce that accompanied the dish.    It was my first time trying Persian food. There was a lot of different herbs and spices in the meal like sumac that I haven't tried before.    If you are looking for something different, you should definitely give this place a try"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Persian food, North York or Richmond Hill is where you need to go. Unfortunately this did not meet the quality of places in those suburbs. I had the koobideh here, and while the meat was good, the rice and vegetables were not. The rice was far too oily, the tomatoe was overrippened and fell apart while eating. The price is crazy too, about double what you'd pay in the suburbs."}
{"text":"I found the food incredibly inedible. However it strikes me as food that is extremely authentic for the culture. If you're looking for hyper-authentic this might be the place for you."}
{"text":"Yummy! We had the ghormeh sabzi (herbs and beef stew) and the fesenjoon (chicken in a pomegranate walnut sauce) both were delicious! Their spinach-yogurt was also a great side. The space is super inviting and clean and the staff make you feel like you're part of the family."}
{"text":"Had the Vaziri meal. The Rice and salad were good. However, the Chicken and beef were very dry. Very disappointed especially for how expensive the meal was."}
{"text":"If you are opening a new place next to Banu, the best Persian restaurant in Toronto, you need to at least try to compete. The space is very uncomfortable. The tables are slanted and the chairs uncomfortable and bulky. Then our food came and it was an even bigger disappointment. The rice had no salt. The chicken was undercooked. The Koobideh was dry. The only thing that was good about the place were the staff.  You guys won't last thinking this is what your customers are looking for. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Recently stopped by for lunch here on a weekend. It's a small space with only enough seating for about 6 people, so lots of people get takeout (you can also order through JustEat). Chelo & Co. is new and you can see that they are genuinely interested in getting to know their customers. The man at the cashier was really sweet and happy to help my DC and I pick from their varied menu. He even gave us a generous sample of their bean and noodle soup (Asheh Reshteh) while we waited for our meals to be prepared.   I had the Fesenjoon - a hearty and fragrant chicken stew with a walnut pomegranate sauce served with rice and yogurt ($13). I am no Persian food connaiseur, but I have enjoyed several meals at Pomegranate and Sheherzade and this was a dish I tried before, so I wanted to compare. I was really pleased with the Chelo & co. version -- chicken was tender and fell off the bone, and the portion size was really big! My DC opted for the eggplant wrap which was really large too and great value for only $6!! The garlic sauce and feta cheese went well with the eggplant (I had to try a bite!).   My DC has an Iranian spouse and eats a lot of Persian food, and she felt the dishes here were excellent and authentic. It's also nice to support a family-run business. The website says that they previously had 2 other Persian restaurants in Toronto and London, so they have a lot of cooking experience!   My only suggestion for improvement would be to have some real plates (instead of plastic containers) for those who decide to eat in the shop. Otherwise, I will definitely be back and am glad to see a yummy Persian restaurant downtown because there aren't that many! I hope they do well:)"}
{"text":"This is one of the \"go to\" places for lunch.  By altering their menu you save 3$ and get a healthier meal.  It has been named \"OG Special\"  Ambiance (3 stars): Very small restaurant, no waiter service, seats on the bar for only 3 people.  Food (4 stars): I usually order 2 kebabs, wrapped in nan, with a tomato and a large salad (similar to tabouli).  The cost comes to 10$. (This is a small variant on their menu item where you get rice.  If you ask to replace rice with a larger salad you save ~3$).  Service: (5 stars) Them changing the menu to your liking and adjusting the price to be cheaper shows their want to make customers satisfied.   I would recommend this place if you are looking for a healthy lunch to take back to your office.   Would not plan to eat there at all.    You can call them to make reservations so you pick up right aware without wasting time waiting for food that you cannot realistically eat there."}
{"text":"Had the koobideh entree previously and its a crazy amount of food.  This time having a koobideh wrap and a seperate chicken wrap... Food is definately great and a bit on the pricy side.  However, considering the lack of selection around, i can't really complain.   Remember you get what you pay for and this is definately some good new eats in the area."}
{"text":"We found this place as a recommendation on yell and decided to come to the restaurant for one night. Unfortunately we didn't know that it is mainly a takeout business. But we were really surprised! Best Kubideh we had so far in Toronto! The food was done quickly, the service was fast, and prices were okay! Highly recommended! Please spread the news because there weren't many people when we came! :)"}
{"text":"The most flavorful food. The meat was tender and cooked to perfection_  and to my delight the rice was served with the perfect amount of crispy cooked rice from the bottom of the pan!"}
{"text":"The weather is cold and chelo is the perfect place for some quick Persian comfort food.  The service is fast and friendly. On my first visit I had the Aash e reshte which was ok but was lacking fried mint and onions, also there were far to many noodles.  Upon my second visit I had the Koobideh with rice, salad and tomatoes. It was good for take out, everything was cooked well and I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Hit up Chelo & Co and ordered the Vaziri Kabab and it really hit the spot. Both the beef and chicken kabobs were juicy and delicious, the rice was nice and fluffy and the small salad it came with was solid. It is prepared fesh so wait times can be a drag, calling in your order might be a good idea. The place is on the small side, not really a place to eat in with only a few bar seats. Definately one of the better kabab spots in downtown TO, will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm.....some tasty Persian food near Trinity Bellwoods. Koobideh is delicious, ash-e-reshteh is amazing, chicken barley soup is for real, and the mirzeh ghasemi is smoky goodness. Love it!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed. I ordered 2 entrees online through their website (powered by dineTO I think) I arrived to pick up at the specified time and had the worst restaurant experience of my life. I walked in and told the guy behind the counter I had ordered online. He looked at me blankly then asked my name. He then asked what time I had ordered so I asked what time it was currently at which point he just pointed at a clock whereupon he told me I hadn't ordered anything. I understand that maybe it was an error on the part of the website but the guy was desperately unhelpful and rude. He did not offer to make the food or apologize in anyway for the inconvenience, he just scowled and acted like I was bothering him. Shortly afterward I emailed the restaurant and received no reply. Great way to conduct business. I would have been a regular."}
