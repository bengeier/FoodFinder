{"text":"Can I just say this place is amazing!!! My boyfriend and I had the corn in a cup and we both shared a Churritos Extreme! It was so yummy! It's a nice small spot and the prices are pretty reasonable considering how much stuff they put in my Churritos! Lol will define toy recommend this place and of course I will come back again to try everything else on the menu! Customer service was great too! The cashier was really nice and answered our questions and even recommended some things from the menu. Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot for all your cravings! I've been here 3 times and the service, drinks and food were great each time. The last time we went we got there just before closing and they stayed opened for us until we were finished and we weren't rushed out or anything. I've tried the chalimon, chamango, fresas con crema, esquite, Diablitos and the mexicali dog, tosti elote and the tostiloco and I can tell you it was all so delicious. The prices are also great."}
{"text":"The price for the corn in the cup changes every time I go there. The last time I went, the guy charged me 7 dollars and some change. For a cup of corn.  they're tiny cups on top of that! You sit there waiting FOREVER. Even when there's NO ONE THERE. My friend went the same week, got the same corn in the cup. Paid 4 dollars. Ha. The guy noticed it was taking forever the second to last time so he said \"you could've just called...\" like uhhh I didn't say anything? Lol. So the next time we call, the guy says \"just come in\"  took forever again. Makes ZERO sense. I'll stick to Lindo Michoacán ice cream."}
{"text":"We finally found Sonoran Dogs in Vegas. Great homemade food! Open until 8pm weekdays and 9pm on weekends."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! We definitely recommend the Sonora Dog, Churros Locos and the Mexicali Dog. 

The guy was really nice, helpful and attentive. He speaks perfect English and Spanish and the menu is in English and Spanish so no need to worry about a language barrier. 

This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"I literally came to this place with high expectations. The presentation they have for their raspados looks really good in pictures, but in reality you get shaved ice with flavor just like the neighborhood elotero. So sad!! On top of that, one of the workers was literally eating chips behind the counter while making our raspados. Is that even sanitary?? Honestly, not a place I would return to, or recommend to my friends and family. Wish los pinguinos had more than just a food truck, esos si son raspados!!!"}
{"text":"I had read reviews about this place both good & bad but just like any other place it depends on who's working & how they treat the costumer. I had went Sunday 04/23/17 around 8pm that day their was a short Hispanic girl working the register I was giving her my order THREE TIMES I showed her exactly what I wanted which was a ChamoFresa raspado THREE TIMES I POINTED TO WHAT I WANTED & guess what she still gave me the raspado she wanted a plain agua fresa raspado. I also ordered fresas con crema AND GUESS WHAT they forgot to give it to me so by than their was a chubby gentleman working the register I believe he was the manager... After being charged for the dessert they tell me their out of strawberries! I complained to the guy working the register & he told me he could upgrade me to the fruit salad... This whole time he was rolling his eyes at me which is incredibly rude! I asked for my money back on the fresas con crema but on the raspado I got charge twice even though it was their fault! This place is so unorganized!!!! The employees don't listen to what you want & the manager still wants to give you attitude. Never will I stop by this place again & I'll be sure to tell my friends & family to avoid coming here too..."}
{"text":"Went to this place while visiting family in Henderson... this place is Amazing!!! Their raspados and other 'chuchulucos' (snacks) were on point!!! I sure appreciate a place that has snacks like this place! You guys rock - my only question is - when are you opening a location in Phoenix?"}
{"text":"The raspado was Delicious!!!! The hole place looked very clean and organized there stuff is seriously way better than other places!!! The guy upfront was very helpful and nice.. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Honestly stumbled upon this place and decided to give it a try and I'm so glad I did!! I had the mango spicy shaved ice and it was so good. Everything looked good I can't wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"Super delicious truly recommend This place! They make the best Diablitos and Tostilocos!! Believe me I've been looking for a place like this in a long time!!"}
{"text":"Mom was craving some tostilocos so we went, which were amazing  he recommended a cachanilla raspado  never had one till today it was awesome. Definitely going back it was worth the drive."}
{"text":"This place was HORRIBLE ! I was so excited to try this place out. I drove 30 mins. Which I didn't mind  because I was excited to try it out but I was big time disappointed... went around 6 pm on 3/4/18 I waited about 45 min. For a raspado and fresas con crema!!! Ridiculous there was only 2 people in front of me. I finally then get my raspado (chafresa) and the guy then says \"sorry but our cream went bad you want anything else\" so then my sister ordered a vanilla raspado (after waiting 45 mins he then told us it \"went bad\". ) The presentation looked delicious for both raspados but it tasted NOTHING like we expected. I got the \"Chafresa\" it legit tasted just like WATER & some red food coloring, something I could make at home. & my sister got a vanilla raspado. Tasted like water & melted ice with drops of vanilla! Waste of time & money. We had to throw it away $15 gone to waste. First & last time coming here. I don't understand what the hype was all about. Their raspados taste just like WATER & they're employees are RUDE! DONT come here!"}
{"text":"I was craving snacks you find in mexico and my coworker recommended this place, definitely will be back. Very tasty and fresh ,its made as you order and doesnt take forever to order and get served. They are on uber eats if you want to try it and dont have the time to go. Friendly staff and helpful with questions we have ,thanks again and see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Driving around looking for Raspados and stumbled upon this place and I'm so happy I did. Definitely going to return"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of hot dogs but my husband has been stuck on them ever since our daughter cheered at a soccer game and they sold \"street dogs\". So when I saw this place I had to take him. He LOVED it, I actually did as well. The staff was friendly and it smelled clean, then it smelled delicious when he started cooking up our hot dogs. I recommend the Mexicali dog, it had  little bit of everything. My husband had the Sonora and loved it. The Raspado I had was delicious as well."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. If you haven't been here you need to come to this place! So many good choices you would want to take one of everything. A must try and my favorites are a Tostielote, cachanilla, hot cheeto elote and of course a chamango."}
{"text":"I had my Mexican snack craving served at this place. I called 10 mims before closing and They waited for me. I go tostielotes and tosti camarón. Both were very tasty, I would recommend you add more hot sauce if you like spicy."}
{"text":"The food was bien hecho!  The best dog is the mexicalli dog that's whats up.  Come try it."}
{"text":"This place and the place next door panchos has roaches seen them with my own eyes. Health department need's to step in and I am reporting it because I hate to see people get sick. Just clean it up people. I hate leaving these reports but it's a public health hazard."}
{"text":"I stop here atleast once a week lol.. I always order a diabilto.. my fav!!! The owners are super nice.. they also have vegan options which is why I keep coming to this place.. love it love it"}
{"text":"Now this is good! Hot dogs are amazing. I haven't tried the fruit deserts yet but I am going to. The owner is friendly and an awesome guy. I've brought my friends and they also enjoyed. The Mexicali dog is my current favorite."}
{"text":"Great spot to hit up on your way to (or from) the nearby Tropicana theater! Menu includes Mexican street dogs and several snack/dessert options like raspas, ice cream, and prepackaged chips and candies. Convenient for those who want to smuggle in their own concessions to the movies.

Tried the Mexicali Dog, with plenty of toppings. There is also the option to build your own. I was treated to a sample of the vanilla raspa, which was extremely sweet. They do offer spicy versions with chile and tabasco, as well as additional condensed milk and other toppings.

Ownership is very friendly. Interior is small, with two tables for dining in- more of a grab and go kind of spot. Hours are currently unlisted and flexible, but they generally close around 8PM. This spot is a bit hard to see from the street, but located behind the gas station at Tropicana and Pecos."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Vegas for our anniversary and I knew I wanted to try and find somewhere that sold Sonoran dogs. He lived in Tucson AZ for two years and loves them, but it's hard to find a good version outside of AZ. We were really impressed with this place! We got the Sonoran dog and the Sinaluense smoothie. Both were so good! I would highly recommend this place. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Awesome find! Had some amazing deserts and the customer service is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Grew up in soCal and was looking for a good vanilla raspado like I used to get from the paleta man. Came across this place. I ended up with both a vanilla raspado and chamango for $13. The vanilla raspado was a little too sweet for my liking. The condensed milk flavor was a little too strong. Prior to this, I had never had a chamango and I was pleasantly surprised! Really good! I'd probably skip on the raspado but will definitely go back for their chamango!"}
{"text":"Excellent place, many combination raspados available, their hot dogs are really delicious,  clamatos are awesome, tostilocos, fruit salads, banana splits, churros locos, corn on the cob and corn in a cup are amazing!! 
Hands down the best flavor on everything I've tried there.....yummy!!"}
{"text":"Everything we have had from there has been awesome. Raspados are gigantic. Prices are great. Mangoneadas are delicious. Popsicles were good, kids liked the ice cream, and the flan was good too! If I'm on that side of town, I'm definitely making a stop here!"}
{"text":"Me & my mom stopped by here to my eat.  We tried a couple different things & they were all BOMB! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"CHAMANGO! Finally I have found a delicious chamango! They are other goodies I can't wait to try too! And the fact they have vegan options are a super plus!! The gentleman who helped me was super kind and it was super fast! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been searching high and low and I've finally found someone who makes Sonoran hotdogs! This places is cheap, good portions and the raspados are refreshing. You don't even have to like Mexican food to like this place... I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"You know when someone cooks the food with love? Well this is what it tasted like! Food was delicious, fresh and did I mention that it was freaken good! The cherry on top was the customer service! Super nice very attentive made us feel welcomed! My honey said he wanted to come back as soon as we left!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat at. Friendly service, quick, and was able to recommend food based off my taste. You can tell people like this place because the food is always fresh. Turnover is awesome. Whoever the owners are, thank you for the great food and service."}
{"text":"My fiance and I visited this place because I were craving a raspado, the kind I'm used to getting in AZ. We drove from the Henderson area just to give this place a chance and boy am I happy we did! We went in and each got our own combination. It was a raspado with ice cream and fresh fruit. The price was reasonable and it taste amazing. He took his time making them well too. We are definitely planning to make the drive down this way soon for another!!"}
{"text":"Best spot handsdown first time ever trying Mexicali raspados and omg I will definetly come back!!!"}
{"text":"Finally a place that has my favorite stuff I brought my siblings and I some raspados they are definitely super good .. Service is great and very friendly can't wait to be back.. I had a mango raspado with chamoy which is my favorite but they have about anything u can think of ..... I can literally be here everyday :o thankfully it's next to my home .."}
{"text":"The size is a little small and the added tamarind pieces felt unnecessary but the chamango was delicious! I liked the fact that they mix the ice and the mango flavor like Starbucks does with their frappes"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place after leaving Pancho's Vegan Tacos. This place is right next door and to my surprise they have many vegan options on their menu. The guy who took my order was very helpful and explained to me what all of the vegan options/substitutions were.

I ordered the fruit salad, which is made with fresh strawberries, bananas, vegan cream, granola and topped with vegan whipped cream. The whipped cream actually had more of an ice cream-like texture, which I really enjoyed.

They call it a fruit salad but it definitely comes close to being a parfait. The only difference is that they use a sweet cream instead of yogurt. The strawberries were so delicious! They were big, ripe and fresh! The only thing I'd change would be to add cream to the bottom of the cup before adding the fruit so it's more layered.

Overall I loved it, it was a delicious and refreshing sweet treat! This place is definitely a hidden gem, I'll probably end up being a regular here."}
{"text":"Clamato supremo, comes with shrimp, oyster, and cucumber very good, a little on the spicy side. Everything looked good on the menu, I'll have to try some of the other things later. They also do delivery within 10 miles."}
{"text":"They were really skimpy on the mayo and cheese and on top of it the corn was still raw . He took forever to even get it out to us . The prices were to high . I don't suggest this place the one on Sahara and Decatur  is where it's at ."}
{"text":"I've been craving this. And they met my expectations it is so delicious it looks good it tastes good and I didn't have to wait that long the guy was nice and friendly he acknowledge me when I walked in even though he was busy he said he'll be right with me they are great can't wait to go back.

Thanks again and great job"}
{"text":"If I could do 0 stars, I would. First of all, I ordered food through UberEats and my order was incomplete, I was missing a chamango and my boyfriend's coke. The Uber driver said that was the only food they got. I called the place to let them know that my order was incomplete and some very incompetent girl answered the phone and told me \"well I don't know what you want me do\" the least I was expecting was an apology since I had to drive over to get my missing items that I had already paid for. Upon arriving, my boyfriend got off to pick up the things and when he brought them to the car I discovered that the chamango was completely melted and I asked him if they re-made it in front of him and they didn't meaning that they gave me the same chamango that had been sitting there for the last 30 minutes. Needless to say I am never ordering from there again and I'll make sure to let my family and friends know about the terrible service from Mexicali Raspados."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying i cant believe ive been to Vegas 5 times n this is was my first time  here... very disappointed on my part .... i loved it very good,great personnel (there employee did mannequin challenge wit us thats a +++++ )made us feel at home ... Thank You Mexicali Raspados late post but better late than never keep it up"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!!!! I love coming here, the customer service is so welcoming. Ive been here 3/4 times and they always have Netflix playing movies while you wait. Very authentic mexican snacks!"}
{"text":"Food is bomb! I missed so many snacks after going vegan but this place has filled that void 
Im always bringing people here and there really is something for everybody - ice cream, Raspados, hot dogs, chips, fruit, vegan options, etc 
I'm partial to the vegan Fresas con Crema and Takis elote! Or vegan Takis locos. Seriously good, addictive might be a better way to describe them. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed.. we drove about 15 miles out of the way here because of the reviews. Went when no one was here. A young lady holding a baby and a little girl came out from the back to greet and take our order. We ordered an esquite and a mangoñada. We sat waiting in the waiting area for 30 mins.. NO EXAGGERATION! We didn't want to seem rude to we just waited.. finally she came out and first thing we noticed were the small portions. The esquite was put in a very small white cup. There was no cheese and it was splattered with Valentina. It just didn't taste right. Then the mangoñada was super watery.. the yellow mango was tasteless.. it honestly tasted like water and chamoy. The mangoñada was 7$!! Together we spent almost 15$ and we ended up throwing it out at the nearest gas station.  Don't know what the hype was all about"}
{"text":"My brother has always talked about this place and man it amazing . I def will be back for around 2. I believe he was the owner but he was awesome . Letting me know which one is the best sellers they have . I love that the gentlemen remember my brother and like I said I'll be back ! People please don't miss out!!"}
{"text":"Why are Mexican dessert places always so dirty???
I like the location, I like the selection of treats and snacks (although I think I'm probably 20 years past the 'tostiloco' phase of life), I like the prices and the friendly service.
Unfortunately, the ambiance leaves something to be desired. Dirty tables, dirty ground, cluttered ordering/serving counter, empty napkin and topping dispensers (seriously, they couldn't even give us napkins when we asked!)
Although I know it's not really their specialty, I would really really like a fresh fruit raspado!
Overall: I won't go out of my way, but when the girls or I are in the area, craving a raspado, Mexicali is a good stop."}
{"text":"Try the shrimp cocktail it's simply amazing! Had been craving for Mexican snacks. Also short waiting and the guy who prepared the food is friendly. And if you don't know exactly what you want he'll help you out."}
{"text":"Mexicali dogs are delicious! I also had a spicy fruit slush that was great. I think this place will be good for hangovers."}
{"text":"This place was bookmarked well in advance for my out of control cravings...and DAMN me gusta! 

It's mid-Jan and FREEZING but I'm still the type that'll holler at a good place for some chamango! It's in the same plaza as the Tropicana Cinemas, and we had to drive around a little bit to find it - but now that I know, it's in my brains GPS. 

Going in, there were two other ladies there and one guy working. It was a little later in the evening so I'm assuming more people are there to run shop when it's peak hours. 

My fiancé and I started looking at the menu, and to be honest I got super overwhelmed with all the options...and I'm practically vegetarian so SHOUT OUT to the multiple items even I could eat. 

We decided to go with the chamango & hot Cheeto esquite....and like I'm about to go right after this review and set myself up for round 2. 

Super thrilled this place is close by."}
{"text":"First time here and it was great! Customer service was amazing and our order was super yummy! They took their time to make it a quality drink. Would definitely recommend for a quick, yummy date! This is the chamango!"}
{"text":"Really good raspados we got like 6 different flavors
 and they were all really good 2 of them had 
ice cream and the tostilocos muy ricos 
Going back to try their mangoniadas :)"}
{"text":"THE BEST CHURROS LOCOS IN LAS VEGAS! 
It took me a while to decide on what to order because everything on their menu sounds soo good... I decided to try their churros locos and they were just what I was expecting they were perfect! I also ordered a Mango diablito & it was BOMB!! staff has great customer service too. I think I'll be back later on tonight to try those hot dogs they sell that look delicious! You definitely have to go try their stuff!"}
{"text":"Very clean place and friendly staff. The sonora hotdog was delicious and my churro locos was perfect....I think that's what it was called. It had clamato, Cacahuates, pepino, and chamoy.......so good. Yum"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! Except the fries. They tasted like old freezer fries but the Sonora dog, the flamin elote and strawberry coconut pineapple sinaluense with strawberry cheesecake ice cream was beyond DELICIOUS! Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"So when I came to Vegas I've seen them online on Instagram it popped in my feed, by the photos I wanted to try them. I've been to Mexicali numerous times and i was expecting to live up to Mexicali since they're using the name! I was very disappointed with what I ordered I got the mangonada and chicali oh and also a corn with hot Cheetos dust. They don't use real ice cream not even natural product they use syrups of a variations of flavors! Sadly nothing even compared to Mexicali!!!!!"}
{"text":"They are lame... its not even 8pm and they are closed! Debt post you close at 8pm ir you clearly closed before 7:30.. I will go to la michocana instead!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the hot cheeto elote and it was amazing!!! The customer service was amazing! They stayed open a little after their closing time just to make sure we enjoyed our corn!! No other business would want to do that!! Of course we picked up tostilocos too which were also amazing! Thank you Mexicali Raspados!!!"}
{"text":"omg! this place is amazing! I'm from Mexicali and by far the best place ever. i will not go to michoacana again. right now i don't even know what ia that lmao. anyways, got the CACHANILLA AND IT WAS DELICIOUS! my dad got a RASPADO DE PLATANO (banana) we've been looking for that flavor and hadnt found it til today! he was very satisfied.  the service was great. definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Im not one to write reviews but let me tell you this place is so good!!  Love this place!! Awesome authentic raspados!! Great tostilocos!!  Recommend this place to everyone!!"}
{"text":"I wish they were closer to me !!!! I came across them on Instagram & I am a huge supporter of small businesses. My friends & I came at night time assuming close to closing time but the cashier (who also made our yummy snacks) was in no rush to get us out at all. Which was super nice. The place is small, maybe 4 tables at the most. But it's clean. The guy was super nice. This is place is a real treat!"}
