{"text":"Great gem in the west island. Outstanding fish n' chips and burgers.....not to mention the weekly specials.  Must try"}
{"text":"Drinks were great, food was awesome and our server couldn't have been sweeter. I loved the kilts they wear, very nice touch!
We started out with the Irish nachos, they were fantastic, so much better than Mexican ones!! Fish and chips and burger were picture perfect! 
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went there a couple of months ago. The food was ok but the place was not great.  For starter it's way too small. I was seated with a column at my back and was not comfortable. Add to that really loud people on a table getting drunk while their kids are on the next table. Plus it was really hot. The fish and chip I had was ok but no more. 
Considering that the black lion is at couple of doors down, that food is a little bit better, the service is more friendly and the environment is A LOT better."}
{"text":"I've lived in the West Island for over 30 years. My husband and I enjoy a good pub. It's nice to finally find a pub in our neighborhood.  The service was good and we love the ambience and the food."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this pub very much!! Great terrace in the front very big and spaced out nicely!! Owner very friendly and social. He asked us how we were doing like 4 times and socializing with us! Service was perfect and so was are food!! My friens lovea their Indian poutine!!! A must try very very good!!!! I had a nice blonde beer recommended by the waiter. An overall success! It was sunny so we sat outside but I was tempted to go inside as well during my trip to the washroom. Next time on a rainy day im sitting in!"}
{"text":"Great location on a sunny little corner in Beaurepaire.

I have been to the location in Vaudreuil before and liked it, but this newer location is much closer and the new favourite haunt of one of my mates.

Bar menu is relatively complete. Although when I showed last time they were out of the wine bottle we order. This is fine. The mark up on a bottle is normal. 

Beer is great. Good temperatures. 

The only food I tried at this location were the pots tickers,  I enjoyed them. The Guinness  stew and the fish and chips are to be tried. ..had them at the original location and they were great. 

Only complaints..every time I am there there is new staff..the young lovely girl had to ask her coworkers about wine and my friend ordered a bottled beer that she was told would take 20 minutes because they were just then about to put it on ice 

Go for the patio and ambiance. Everything else is gravy ."}
{"text":"Thought this would be an adult pub style eatery.
Noisy and many young children.
Nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"TLDR: Cosy pub, great beer, and tempting food.

I visited Dukes and Devines on a date and it was a great choice. The servers were smiley and friendly (and sporting green kilts), and there was a roaring fire keeping the place warm. The draft beer selection was diverse, and I was thrilled to see St. Ambroise Noire on the list. Their menu and the smells from the kitchen were tempting, so I may have to go again for their food. Overall a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"Great renovations for a cozy meal. All the food I've tried has been delicious, including healthy salads, yummy wings and things! Thank you for opening in downtown, sunny Beaconsfield!!"}
