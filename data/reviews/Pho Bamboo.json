{"text":"Raised price on their Pho alot and lowered the portion of beef.  Never again!!"}
{"text":"If anyone gives this place 3stars and up for their pho, they never had real pho before. I've had pho my whole life and their pho was  bland. There was hardly any meat, their meatballs are cut into quarters instead of halves. Their tendon was as tiny as a dime and their hosin sauce was so watered down. I got the special pho that has everything but very disappointed. I would have given two stars but the customer service was bad too. We had to ask them several times to get things we ordered and requested. Definitely won't be back here"}
{"text":"Always looking for a place open late, because I work night shifts a lot. Not much to choose from at night. Decided to give Pho Bamboo a try, So glad i did been looking for a good vietnamese/chinese and I think i found it. Everything was fresh and delicious!!"}
{"text":"Had delivery and requested sweet and sour (crab puffs without sweet and sour??) I know may seem petty but deal breaker. We order 2 orders and then requested it separately.  Good thing I don't tip until delivery!"}
{"text":"Four of us took a chance w this place today on lunch break... was 1130 a.m., place was empty; we ordered take out and sat down to wait....

Re appearance/cleanliness--eh--the more we looked around while waiting, the more we decided to NOT look around.... nothing filthy or horrific, just felt \"let go\" and NOT especially fresh or clean

Re staff/help-- better -- guy taking our order was friendly and personable;  he was neither slow nor quick in taking (or later-- ringing up separately) our orders. When questioned by this ignorant girl about an item common on dinner menu (sour bean sprouts?), I was told he \"never heard of it\" \"didnt know\" and that he was a \"new employee\" lol smh

Re food itself-- and the real reason this made 4 stars!!!! Deeeee-lightful! I had orange chicken w so many more flavors than i am accustomed to (was that GINGER in there? CILANTRO??)- it was fresh, spicy (ask for 4/5 spice level), and a wonderful taste explosion for my mouth. Had eggrolls- tasty and NOT greasy (and recieved 3 on an order of 2-- yes!!).  Broccoli beef was special ordered w a \"please no additional veggies\" request.  Onion were still included, but very good lunch, none the less.  Crab wonton was also sampled and met with approval.  Again, not like we've had anywhere else, but very good!

'Excellent and tasty'' food/ 'nice' service/ 'eh' cleanliness seen from front dining area.....

Based on the food, we WILL be going back."}
{"text":"I called and ordered the broccoli entree and egg rolls and was told by the host on the phone that I had to purchase more food, even though I was above the minimum price stated online for delivery! After waiting 30 minutes the restaurant called me to say they were out of broccoli and asked if they could substitute cauliflower instead!!!!! YEA NEVER EVER AGAIN! Pho Bamboo SUCKS!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, and service. I felt like I was right in their home, and I was their star guest. Koy was especially helpful and nice."}
{"text":"This is my second time here in the last few days. I came in just a couple days after they opened to experience their veggie pho and see if we could be friends :) I was completely blown away by the flavor and the quality of the broth, as well as the variety and amount of vegetables present. This is the real deal! Authentic Vietnamese cuisine by people who give a damn about good quality flavor and consistency. Also ordered their fresh rolls with tofu, they have generous portions of fresh mint which greet the palate with a bold hello! The peanut sauce is more hoisin flavored than peanut, but still delicious with some sriracha on it! 
I'm back for the incredible pho, round two...lets see if they can bring the same experience!"}
{"text":"Food was good! I got pad Thai and egg rolls. I thought both were good for the most part. The pad Thai could've used a little more flavor which is why it got 4 stars."}
{"text":"If your looking for a mom and pop authentic Vietnamese restaurant thats served with a smile.... this is your place. They happen to have an extended restaurant next door that offers vegan Thai/Vietnamese food, yet they will serve it to you on the pho side. :) Service has always been consistently friendly, atmosphere never crazy, so I like that.I love thier vegan pho, and also tofu rolls. Its in my hood and I'm grateful."}
{"text":"I'm a pho junky. It's my favorite food on the planet. This place is quick, inexpensive, and really good. I've gotten delivery a few times from there and it always arrives hot and fresh.
I get pho tai, spring rolls, and crab puffs. I haven't been disappointed yet. Broth is flavorful and savory. Veggies are always fresh. 
The delivery people are always nice and just the fact they deliver is awesome."}
{"text":"We didn't get pho, to be fair, but the bun cha gio was bleh. We ordered a rice dish too. Bleh!"}
{"text":"Dirty, sticky, and messy on the inside. I've been in fraternity houses on a Friday night with a cleaner floor. The water tasted like I stuck my straw up a frog's ass. Service was very very veeerrrrrrrryyyyy sloooooow. The server handed us our forks by the fork end, not the handle. The chop stick holder was all sticky and looks like it had never been cleaned (see pics). Worst. Place. Ever."}
{"text":"Awful service. Not worth the hassle- called to check on our delivery order after 90 minutes and she says \"oh yes we just got that in\"... I said \"but it's been 90 minutes... Can we cancel\".... She says \"order is on its way!\" and hung up on me :/"}
{"text":"Great food! Nice atmosphere. The Pho is my favorite in AZ!

Only complaint is that there is soooo much cilantro! Besides that, everything is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Prices here are average. I ordered a Vietnamese Coffee and Fresh Spring Rolls with shrimp and pork. As much as I was looking forward to my lunchtime snack I was left disappointed. The spring rolls were made with iceberg lettuce? And served with hoisin sauce?? Okay- I know I'm Caucasian but I grew up in Little Saigon and know hoisin sprinkled with peanuts is an insult of a dipping sauce for spring rolls. I had ordered to go so by the time I got my box open there was no way to turn around without being late to my doctor's appointment. 
The spring rolls were subpar and my coffee!! Oh, my coffee. It would have been good if the almost $3 I spent had actually filled my cup... It was ALL ice. I saw the girl behind the counter mixing a small glass cup of coffee to the side but thought it was for herself- NOT my order. There was no way that small cup would have filled my cup. My coffee cup was not full of anything but ice and I got maybe 5 small sips from the whole thing. The rest was sadly big chucky ice cubes that needed to melt in order to quench my thirst at that point. Did I mention there was so much ice packed in the cup my straw broke? I'm really sad because I usually don't try to write bad reviews but this place made me regret trying a new Vietnamese joint. Who messes up spring rolls and coffee?! Hopefully this was just a fluke and others have better experiences but I won't be coming back. I know what I like and this place isn't it."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible food!! Spent a fortune to have it delivered through GrubHub and received crap!! The pork was hard and tough. The fish sauce is sweet and nasty. Go to Saigon pho. It's half the price and always great!!! Gotta go, my stomach is killing me!!!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and best orange chicken I have ever tasted. I tip them 10 bucks every time cause there so nice and the food is so damn good"}
{"text":"So so so bad. First off I got delivery and the delivery person didn't even look at me, he just thrusted the food toward me and left. Now on to the actual food, I ordered steak pho, lo mien, crab puffs and spring rolls and green tea ice cream. The steak came raw with the pho, the soup and the noodles were separate and the noodles were plain sticky and smelled like plastic, there was also a really strange smell to the broth that I can't place which makes me not want to eat it. The lo mien was ok, the meat was really dry and so were the noodles. The spring rolls were ridiculously sticky, the pork was dryer than dry, the shrimp smelled off. Lastly the green tea ice cream tasted like green flavored rotten mangoes, green tea ice cream is not supposed to taste like anything other than tea. I am scared that we're going to get food poisoning. I basically paid $45 to get food poisoning. DON'T EAT HERE"}
{"text":"This place is not good. Horrible service. They're delivery see i takes forever. Incompetent staff. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place used to be Blue Moon Vietnamese kitchen, and I guess they remodeled since they changed ownership. Reading all the vibes about this place, I decided to give it a try. I will start off describing the food: My pho is good and the broth tastes very authentic. It reminds me of the local Pho joints back in my home country. Service is great and proficient. 

Here comes the bad part: Fox News is broadcasted during my visit, mosquitoes are flying all over the place (I got bit at least 2 times), weird smell of heat ointment flowing in the air, and the ambiance of the restaurant is way too quiet which can make you feel awkward . I just wish that they had a decent location to grow their business."}
{"text":"would give no stars went 2days ago my fiancé &me both got severe food poisoning ordered $40 worth of food pho tasted nasty tofu just eww and the sandwiches dry and hard even the mango stickyrice was hard im so upset im going back today to get my money back"}
{"text":"I wanted to give them a second try with delivery and I can say with certainty I will never order delivery from them again - two hours from the time I ordered my food to the time it was received!! Food tasted ok - not great - just ok.  Done with Pho Bamboo for ever"}
{"text":"I have been here several times, all I ever order is pho.  Unfortunately over half the time they try to give me extra cilantro instead of basil, \"we are out\", it's a small detail but I love basil, and Mekong is RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET!  No excuse.  Also, it is just a plain disaster to communicate with the staff, as none of them speak English.  I can handle language barriers very well, it's over the top here.  Well today I went again, final straw, NO BASIL AGAIN!...or jalepeno's they tried to give me cilantro again with some orange peppers, really?  I watched at least six people walk in and wait well over 25 just to get a drink order, the Uber eats/grub hub drivers were coming to pick up orders and when they went to the app again found that the order had been canceled because the guest waited over an hour.  For the life of me I can't imagine how they are still in business.  Needless to say will not return."}
{"text":"I do agree with others reviewers, the place is dirty, the windows and floors are sticky and the restroom is filthy too...
I love Vietnamese food, so we are always trying new places...this is the first place that disappointed me...I do usually order pho, but this time I wanted to feel adventurous and ordered a pork Vietnamese sandwich...I ordered \"to go\" so I tried it at home, it's the worst sandwich I have ate in my life and in top of that had to paid for it! I live quite far so coming back it's not an option. 
The pork didn't had any flavor just a strange paste and lots of jalapeño peppers plus the bread was very hard and dry...

Do yourself a favor and don't stop here, cross the street to the Mekong plaza and try another Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"I was so hungry when I came in. The service was very slow considering I was the only customer. Every time I said thank you to the waitress she just walked away. I finally got the hint and avoid saying anything at once. I basically felt like I was bothering her. I order 3.1-pho combo. The broth is usually my favorite part of pho but this broth is different. It was greasy, clear broth and had no flavor to it. It tasted like straight chicken broth (the low sodium kind..lol). Even though I was famished but I only take 5 sips of the broth and tried to tolerate the rest. I gave up because it was just terrible."}
{"text":"Here's a few tips Pho Bamboo: 1- change your hours of operation on your website. If you're not open 10am-Midnight Saturday-Sunday.... don't have that show on yelp and your website. 2- if you close at 9pm, lock your door and turn your \"Open\" sign off when it's 9:23pm. 3) don't recommend we go to your \"other location that's open til midnight\" (pho Tempe) only to find them to be closed. Awful customer service and I don't recommend to anyone. The place was a mess too so maybe it was a blessing in disguise we weren't able to dine here."}
{"text":"The Pho was delicious! The delivery is super slow though, but I'm not sure if that's the app. I ordered bolba and it came with a small straw is the only reason I gave 4 stars"}
{"text":"This place used to be my go to place so it's hard for me to write a review like this. Service has always been just ok here but the food would always make me come back.  The last couple of times I went has been so disappointing.  Not only was the service hard to bare but the food has gone downhill.  So sad. I hope the owner reads these reviews and changes things around."}
{"text":"We have been here a number of times and have not been disappointed yet. Had the bun rieu and the vermicelli bowls and pho and it was yummy. And service is good also."}
{"text":"A huge disappointment! We spent almost $40 and none of the food came out right. This place is unexpectedly bad. We ordered to go at 5 pm and the food was not ready till 6 pm. The cook didn't start making the food until we got there, not to mention she didn't even know what we ordered. What kind of restaurant is that? We are definitely not going back."}
{"text":"I have come down with my yearly sinus infection, feeling crapy, and got an unbarable craving for some comforting pho. I ordered delivery, took about 45 mins. Not to bad at all even though the broth was just luke warm when it arrived. No big deal I just warmed in on the stove while i prepared the rest of the soup. The broth was very rich and tasty. The disapointment came in when I paid a dollar for extra veggies. The \"veggies\" were nothing more than bean spouts. No onion, carrots, nada, just sprouts. I always order vegetable pho so the lack of vegtables just left me with broth and noodle basiclly. All in all my craving has been satisfied but I wouldn't drive out of my way to eat at this paticular pho joint,  however on a lazy day in a pho craving pinch I would order delivery again."}
{"text":"So ive ordered the delivery three times now. same thing each time. The Combination egg noodle soup. Supposed to come with egg noodles, shrimp, and pork. Everytime Ive ordered this, I've literally received 1 shrimp. Yea, ONE SINGLE SHRIMP. You should rename it the \"Egg noodle with pork a ONE single shrimp tail.\"  And I dont know why you changed your egg noodles but they were awful. Probably wont order here anymore."}
{"text":"The worst ! 

Very dirty inside. Disorganized, stacks of papers, dishes,equipment everywhere. Floor is sticky, bugs on the ground, cobwebs everywhere. I literally asked for a refund and left."}
{"text":"I had the pho thai and it was delicious! I'm an american white guy so not an expert on viatnamese but I loved it. The broth was very flavorful. Of course, pho broth generally is made from the same basic ingredients, but I can tell they use their own unique recipe here because  the broth has a slightly different (but equally delicious) taste compared to what i rememver at the other places around here where I've eaten pho. The restaurant itself was on the more casual side and service was good."}
{"text":"Great food but the foods comes out relatively slow compare to other pho places. Didn't get my drink because the guy who makes smoothies doesn't work on that day."}
{"text":"3 and 1/2 or 4 stars would be fair. I ordered a bún bì tht nng and added ch giò, my husband got cm sn. The food wasn't amazingly good but wasn't as bad as some reviews that I read before I came in. I always like to verify things myself. The check was $17. Overall, it's good."}
{"text":"I usually don't want to give restaurants a 1 star but I have to and this is purely based on the food. The customer service was good but unfortunately it did not compensate the quality of the food. I have to say, this must be the first bad quality Vietnamese restaurant I've been to and it's really disappointing. 

My husband and I saw the Yelp ratings and it was averaged to be 3 stars so figured it can't be that bad and decided to give it a try. I ordered a bun rieu and my husband ordered a Pho. He said it felt like the Pho noodles was refrigerated and it wasn't fresh. But I didn't try his Pho so let's talk about my bun rieu. It was soooooooooo sour and everything in that dish tasted old from the tofu to the shrimp and I felt like I was eating food poisoning! I really hope I won't eat sick from this cuz I'm actually scared that I will..never again will I even consider trying this place out again."}
{"text":"MSG Warning!!
If you are sensitive to MSG (like myself) stay away or pay the price.

Also do not use Grub Hub when ordering, they do not check for orders from them."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  
Nice people, and great food with good prices! 
I'll be going back a lot more.
Highly recommend this place if you want to try some Vietnamese food"}
{"text":"Service was slow despite being the only one in the restaurant. Waited over 20 min for spring rolls and another 10 for soup to come out which never did I ended up cancelling and leaving. With all the pho places popping up in Mesa and Tempe I will go elsewhere. Also chopsticks and small bowl for soy sauce  had old food stuck to them and pepper shaker had jam residue all over top. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I ordered Well Done Brisket Pho and Vietnamese Iced Coffee. I paid $0.50 extra for a side order of Fresh Sliced Onion with Vinegar and had my order delivered to my house via Grub Hub. In a separate container, I received noodles, lime, Thai basil, bean sprouts, well done brisket, an uncooked piece of meat, and other vegetables. My soup was hot, though not hot enough to cook the uncooked piece of meat, so I boiled it myself on my stove. They were generous in the portion of soup they gave me. My only pet peeves were the cup size and amount of ice in the iced coffee and the high pricing. Otherwise, I will order from Pho Bamboo again in the future."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the 1st time late lunch hour
for a take out order.
Ordered Basil chicken which was v good
and a sweet and sour soup which was 
outstanding.
Will be back."}
{"text":"We ordered from Eat24/grub hub. first Pho experience btw prob should not have done delivery. Aside from the order being 37 min late, it was incomplete. No sweet and sour sauce for the chicken fried rice, which only had a few pieces of chicken even tho I ordered extra. Not only that the pho with rare beef came with 1oz of beef, not rare and was actually 1 piece of beef? I will say I will never order delivery again, I will give the place a shot in person one day tho. It really was a bad first impression. Best of luck guys"}
{"text":"This use to be my spot, but I don't know what happened the food here now is not great. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"After confirming an Eat24 delivery order twice, I was told the restaurant misplaced my order and could deliver in 30 min, when it was already 30 min past my delivery time. I use the app frequently so can only assume it was the restaurant's failure. After just arriving in town and with no rental car to go elsewhere to eat, their mistake was not a good start to my trip."}
{"text":"I ordered from this place from UberEATS. I accidentally got it confused with another Vietnamese restaurant from the area that was very good, but I decided to give this one a try. NEVER AGAIN. The food we received looked old and like it was sitting for hours. The crab Rangoon and eggrolls tasted like they had been fried in bad oil...the outcome was also not pretty. My boyfriend and I got food poisoning. This is very serious, since we both have stomachs made of steel and never get sick. DO NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"This place is next to the Green Lotus Vegan restaurant. I checked out their menu and ate here because the Vegan restaurant was hot, and they didn't have electric fans in there. They share the same kitchen, so you can still sit here and order from the Vegan menu. I ordered the tofu spring roll and the tofu tempura. The spring roll was good, but I wasn't impressed with the tempura because it was super greasy! The oil oozed out of the tofu when I took a bite, so I didn't finish it. Next time, I'm just going to get the spring rolls. Seems to be the only thing I like in this place.  Lots of parking space here! 

Closest  Light Rail Station: Sycamore & Main."}
{"text":"This is a review on food and delivery as I am only here for a short visit for work. I'm very satisfied with the quality and taste of food I ordered.  My order was delivered earlier than promised on eat24. We had the beef pho, pork banh mi, and nem nuong rolls. I would definitely order again or visit the restaurant if I'm ever in town again."}
{"text":"Absolutely friendly and inviting atmosphere and service! The food speaks for itself. The food is fresh and is served hot and with a warm smile! If you're in the area, you MUST stop in for a quick bite. The prices are very reasonable considering how much you're getting. Perfect mix of quality AND quantity!!"}
{"text":"I just ordered this place off of Uber Eats and it was pretty terrible.  I ordered the rare beef and meatball pho and they actually forgot my meatballs.  I was stuck with like 3 thin strips of rare beef.  Then I try the actual pho and the broth was flavorless and really greasy.  My wife didn't eat more than 3 bites of hers because she said the oil was coating her mouth and felt weird."}
{"text":"1st time here and I must say the food was really good. Beef Pho can be ordered with \"tender and rare beef\" which is beef like found in most other pho places, but the \"tender\" beef is thick slices of really tender roast beef like meat. Very yummy! Spring rolls were awesome and full of ingredients. A few things to work on: temperature in dining area was too warm, soda machine was down so no Coke products and like some other pho shops they water down the sriracha & hoisin sauce, but here they went a little too far with the water. Family owned and operated, they were very nice and helpful. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This was our first time ordering from here. We also did delivery. The pho was awesome and the delivery staff was friendly. Since we have moved here from Hawaii we have been looking for a fantastic pho place and we found it!!"}
{"text":"So...lol, we went to pho bamboo for the first time the other day and when we sat down and got menus we received menus for the vegetarian place next door. We were very confused, because the restaurants are two separate restaurants but wasn't, and they only serve vegetarian food? So we ordered the vegetarian spring rolls and the egg rolls, which were both very delicious. And when we inquired about the menus our waiter said \"oh we have meat too...\" so yeah very confusing haha! So I guess my advice here is to make sure you ask for both menus, definitely try the spring rolls and egg rolls, and don't look too closely at the cleanliness of this place."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! I'm not feeling well and was craving some Phó. My lovely significant other ordered us some Phó through UberEats. After waiting close to 50 minutes it arrives! Yay...waiting with anticipation! Was very much looking forward to having it. Opened the bag...the disappointment begins! There was not much meat. The soup was barely hot. Barely much  vegetables with it and they charge you for it...granted it's only a $1 but the fact that they charge you for it, they shouldn't stinged you with sides! I specifically notated on the note that I want 3 hoisin packages because I love them along with some schrricha sauce...instead they gave me 1 pack of mixed hoisin and schriccha....it wasn't even full it was a smidgen mixed of the sauce is all they could spare me! Seriously?! Did you guys run out too? I wouldn't have bothered notating how much I love both hoisin & schrricha sauce if I had some at my house to spare! Nevertheless it was a very disappointing dinner."}
{"text":"The delivery order that was supposed to take 45-60 minutes took 90 minutes. The food wasn't bad. Portions were very large. Sauce on the eggplant and tofu dish was on the bland side. I requested light ice in my Thai iced tea, and it seems like they put extra ice in the cup. There are plenty of Vietnamese restaurants in the area with better food."}
{"text":"So we order food on GrubHub. I was looking for some food to be delivered because we didnt feel like going out. The delivery time stated 1hour. We waited for an hour and a half before we called to find out the status of the order. The phone rang and a voice picked up stating \"This user has a voicemail that has not been set up.\" Meaning -- you wouldn't even be able to leave a message even if you wanted to, nevermind not being able to even contact them directly. We end up calling GrubHub to find out if they can contact them or if they have a different resolution for why we are still waiting. GrubHub returned our money and gave us a credit. We literally went to McDonald's down the road because we were so hungry. Not to mention, we were waiting to eat and then go to sleep! ... 2 hours roll around and *knock knock* .. we've literally just finished our fast food - which took all of 6 minutes to go get and bring back - and there they are! Sure everything was hot. It was obvious they forgot or misplaced the order and then made it and sent it out.. No call or anything to let us know what happened.. 

Onto the food quality: Their crab puffs were gross - they literally had no flavor whatsoever. Their orange chicken was soggy and also flavorless. It's a good thing it was inadvertently free, because it was disgusting. The prices were a little up there for the quality of their food. There's a little chinese place down the road from my friend's condo and their food is amazing.. I'm literally craving other crab puffs to replace the taste of BS from last night. 

Not only will I never order anything from this place for delivery ever again. I won't ever set foot in this establishment because their customer service and their food was complete malarkey. 

This place is dead to me. Enjoy your 1 star review... it's deserving for a 0 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Orange chicken was chewy and soggy, the flavor was disgusting. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Omg ! It was not good at all I usually don't give horrible reviews but my father got sick from the vermicelli seafood soup! The seafood was not fresh and was going bad !!!! My pho the soup base was alright but the meat was getting stenchy and you k ow it was getting rotten !!"}
{"text":"Vermicelli sandwiches were alright, but the mango and sticky rice was literally a wad of rice that didn't come apart and the mango was less than fresh."}
{"text":"Cute place with great food. Awesome tofu rolls and brisket pho. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I came here today for lunch and ordered broken rice with bean curd, spring rolls, and fried banana rolls with their chocolate dipping sauce. Loved the rice plate, it was cheaper than com thuan kieus and much more filling. The little old woman sat me and took care of me. She doesn't speak much english but she was very nice and water game was on point. The spring rolls were normal and for 2$ I couldn't complain. Banana rolls were not what I expected. 4 pieces wrapped in wonton not tempura dipped and served with chocolate sauce. It was good but not very traditional. Overall for a small hole in the wall, stomach and wallet were very happy."}
{"text":"Great food, great Pho
Delicious sweet and sour chicken. Close to the house and they deliver"}
{"text":"First time ordering through grubhub and it was by far the best decision I've ever made. The delivery was fast, prompt and polite. I'm sick as heck right now and the chicken noodle pho was amazing, great helping of noodles and chicken and garnishes. The deep fried tofu was delicious and I've never had Thai tea and it tastes like orange cream. I will be back either ordering in or dining out. You made me a customer for life. Brava!!"}
{"text":"Great place. Good prices. Food tastes great and service is very good. Love that they stay open late and I can get my late night pho cravings fix"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Its never a good sign when there aren't cars in the parking lot. Its a worse sign when there is no on in the restaurant at 1 pm on a Saturday. Service was haphazard, the wait time for beverages and food was long (considering there was no one else in the restaurant). The vegetable pho was was merely ok, Prices were very high for food that was mediocre at best. When paying our tab, the owner overcharged us by $2/bowl and tried to short our change until my husband insisted she give us the correct amount. Bad news all around, they won't be there long."}
{"text":"BTW, the phone number is a cell phone, and their VM box is full... If you're trying to find your food, you might have to drive down there..."}
