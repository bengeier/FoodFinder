{"text":"Decent food, nothing spectacular.
The place is loud."}
{"text":"The service and location with patio are great (which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2) but after going several times for dinner, it's safe for me to conclude the food is mediocre.  That's unfortunate given the inflated prices, particularly for the steaks. I'm happy to pay when it's worth it, which is why I can honestly say there are much better places to get a good steak than this. It's one of those restos that is great for an after-work drink, but save your cash for a place that is more deserving of it."}
{"text":"Great food, and friendly service!

We were a large party, and they were very accommodating. Helpful server, who made menu recommendations based on our group's preferences. 

Food was delicious. The standout for me was the charcuterie plate. Great to share

One star off for the slowness of service, as the dinner service progressed. Still very friendly staff, but perhaps understaffed. No water refills in the second half dinner."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and brunch is fantastic with lots of options. I had the florentine benedicte with potatoes and a cordial (the \"high society\" with elderflower).  Everything was very well prepared and delicious."}
{"text":"For the price and alleged reputation of this restaurant, I would have expected much, much better food. The steak I had was pretty mediocre and the portions were not particularly generous. I have had much better food in far less expensive restaurants and pubs. I was hoping the service would at least save some grace, but our waiter was almost shockingly snappy and rude. It looks like we were the lucky ones, however, because two other staff members got completely chastised by him in front of all the patrons, loudly and angrily calling them out on mistakes and demanding one particular waiting staff to \"get over here now.\" Honestly, it felt so uncomfortable the entire time, far from a pleasant meal, and we paid a pretty penny for the lousy experience too."}
{"text":"A friend and I went for drinks and appetizers. Both were pretty good, but the service is amazing. They were all friendly and accommodating. The atmosphere is unique and pleasant."}
{"text":"A beautiful and stunning space paired with classic bistro food makes this place a must for anyone who enjoys food, drink, and a wonderful warm atmosphere.  Very knowledgeable service staff and a kick ass creme brulee along with a fantastic burger and 12 oz ribeye! Bytw the kitchen is open late so it is perfect for people in the industry who have no where decent to eat in the wee hours of the morning in this god for saken city.
Thank you charles for bringing something special to our dull city!"}
{"text":"La Société opened with much anticipation in 2012 due to the 7 figure construction cost and its prime location on Bloor Street, downtown Toronto. It is a beautiful restaurant, the detail in the tiling and stained glass everywhere is perfection. Popular for their oysters and brunch, it is a pretty consistent and convenient place. Since I live walking distance from said restaurant I have been a handful of times and have my go-tos on the menu. Some items have maintained their quality while others sadly have not.

My achilles heal is macaroni and cheese. If it is on a menu, I have to get it. I have been in love with macaroni and cheese since I was introduced to it as a toddler. It was the first dish I ever learnt to cook as a child. I'm pretty sure once I was tall enough to reach the stovetop I was making good old Kraft dinner. It doesn't get much more unhealthy than mac n' cheese, so when indulging, it better be worth it. The first couple times I had the mac n' cheese here I thought it could possibly be the best in the city. Sadly no more. The kitchen has started to pre make and freeze this dish and bake it to order. The last time I ordered it, it was hot the first couple bites and freezing in the middle. I had to send it back twice to get reheated and it was still cold in the middle. I felt sorry for the waiter and it was actually funny how cold it still was after being sent back twice. As for the few warm bites I did manage to catch I could tell they were taking shortcuts with the recipe as well. They have added so much flour in the recipe to thicken it I could actually taste it... je suis désolée.

Tuna tartare is another dish I almost always order when I see it. The tuna tartare here is unique. While most tuna tartars are prepared with avocado in a soy, sesame and wasabi marinade this one has apple, coriander and pinenuts. It is delicious and the portion is generous enough to share as an appetizer.

The bite of my boyfriends burger I had here was excellent, and it should be at $18. It served with a generous, delicious, salty portion of frites. The menu indicates the burger is 8 oz but it seemed more like 6 oz to me. It was well cooked and has lots of flavour and most importantly it was juicy.

Overall, if you live in the area it is worth a visit, otherwise, you can find just as good or better food in your own neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Bonjour Paris!

The minute you arrive, you feel like you've been instantly transported to Paris. The stained class ceiling is stunning; the decor with white and black floor tiles, dark walls covered with vintage prints, dark burgundy leather alcoves, brass accents...all reminiscent of a true Parisien bistro. Beautiful garden terrace; a little cool for when we were there a few weeks ago, but would be perfect when it's warmer. 

The food we had was fabulous: raw oysters, beet salad, lobster bisque. Truly the best beet salad I've ever had. Extensive wine menu, including many non-French wines. Great menu with all the traditional French bistro fare. Service was fab.

All in all, a great experience. Looking forward to returning (when I'm not on an elimination diet - argh) to try their French Onion soup and Steak Tartare. 

Check out my slightly longer review at http://fabulouslyaverage.com/food/la-societe-bonjour-paris."}
{"text":"The two times I've gone to to la société have been family events, which means there are small children, my mother in a walker and a bunch of picky eaters. We take up a lot of space, we move slowly and we - as a table - barely drink. And with all that, La Society makes sure that whatever drama we have is caused by the family and not the restaurant. 
The food is solid. They have been great about accommodating menu requests and what comes out of the kitchen has always been right in terms of how it was ordered no matter what the changes. 
But the standout both times has been the service - to the point where we've remarked at how exceptionally good the waitstaff is. They not only survive one of our invasions - they handle anything that happens gracefully and pleasurably. They also happen to be very charming.
2 out of 2 - means someone is doing a great job hiring and training. I don't know a restaurant that couldn't learn from them."}
{"text":"One of the most beautiful restaurants in Toronto.  The stained glass ceiling is stunning and the mosaic tiled floor is fantastic.  I came for lunch during the heat wave and was surprised that the restaurant was empty - most people were sitting on the patio.  In midday full sun with 40 something degree weather.  I don't get it...Anyway, on to the food!

I started with the appetizer nicoise salad.  It was really refreshing and the tuna was very fresh.  I drank a pear flavoured cocktail - I can't remember the name but it was really tasty!

For my main, I had the croque monsieur and it was as good as I expected it to be.  It came with frites which were very nice.  Make sure you request a side of mayonnaise because it is divine!

I split profiteroles for dessert and it was a nice end to the meal.

Would love to go back in the evening to see the space at night!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience at La Societe. I came here because I was strolling along Bloor Street and found a cute patio restaurant. The waiter that we had for dinner was very professional and the best service I have ever gotten. He was always available when needed and was knowledgable about everything.

I ordered the tuna tartare (which was amazing and perfectly flavored), romaine salad (a little on the simpler side), steak, and seafood lobster bisque (the best!).

The only downside is that the special for the day was \"sold out.\""}
{"text":"Interior design really is amazing, plus the furniture they use, makes you feel like you're in Paris. 
I went there for brunch, can't say anything special about the dishes, but the service and feel of the whole place makes it good enough for me wanting to go back to try regular menu."}
{"text":"Three of us went of us went for dinner on Saturday to La Societe. It was fantastic. 

The space is gorgeous and very inviting. I have to say that I haven't seen a restaurant that's been so pulled together in a while. It's also nice to get away from that whole reclaimed wood feeling that you get at a lot of new restaurants around the city. It really is a stunning space. 

I ordered the steak frites and it was perfectly cooked with a delicious herbed butter and the fries were the best I've had in the city. Served with a garlic mayo, it was perfect. 

The escargots as a starter were the only thing I wasn't super wild about. They were pretty good but the starter was mostly mushrooms and they skimped out a bit on the escargots. Still, it was tasty.  

I would absolutely recommend the restaurant and will be back. I'm looking forward to trying their steak tartar and the scallops."}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary dinner. Out server was amazing and super accommodating with our two month old. We had the tuna tartare, thyme chicken and petit fillet. All dishes were exceptionally cooked. Tuna tartare was beyond expectation. My negatives for this place were the portion sizes and the amount of time it took between our appetizer and main course. We waited approximately 35 minutes after our appetizer for the main course to arrive. The amount they charged for the food given was not proportional either. Will I visit again... Probably not. I can find the same exceptional level of food at other yorkville restaurants that have bigger servings."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. That is about it. Servers do not engage well. They tend to ignore you. There is a pretentious vibe about the place. If you want attention, wear Prada. Not my scene."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to La Societe in over a year.  Used to go all the time and really enjoyed.  Then last summer we had a very bad meal there and our server had mentioned there had been a lot of employee turnover recently.  So, we didn't go back again, until yesterday.

Decided to give it a try for brunch and am happy to say that it seems to have returned to it's previous high standards.  The food was very good and the service was friendly and much better organized than they were a year ago.

We ordered the east and west coast oysters, foie gras terrine, tuna tartare and frites.  Every dish was excellent.  Am so happy that we can enjoy delicious French food again at this beautiful restaurant with it's great view of Bloor St."}
{"text":"FINALLY!  I made it here for Brunch. 

Being the keener I am, I showed up for brunch at 10:30 am this morning and was told to come back in half an hour.  I returned at 10:59 am and was seated on the upper patio.  It was fairly empty, so we were able to pick where we wanted to sit.

The staff is extremely friendly and the coffee was very good.  I ordered the french toast which is two thin slices, cooked separately and held together by chocolate layer in the middle and topped with carmelized bananas.  There was a tiny smattering of fresh berries.  The serving size was small, so I knew I would be hungry in about two hours, but it was so incredibly decadent and delicious.  I savoured every bite.

Best friend got the lobster eggs benedict and said it was also very rich but tasty.  Her meal was double the price of mine and while I loved every bite of what I ate, felt that it was a touch too pricey for the amount I ordered.  However, I am aware that I am eating a chic new Yorkville restaurant and that can be expected.  

I found the service to be top notch and will absolutely return here for many more meals."}
{"text":"Food was a 3 star but I can't forgive our horribly rude server.  She took our money and returned a few minutes later to say that we didn't leave her much money and was wondering what was wrong with her service.  When we asked her to confirm the amount of money we left as a tip, it was less then we know we left.  When asked if we could recount the money we left, she flipped out and said she was not incorrect.  I'm still in shock that this women is employed in the service industry."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with a friend. 

The greeter and second servers were very friendly. 

We ordered the eggs Benedict and the quiche of the day of which was delicious. We also ordered a side of fries and they were fantastic! The latte was beautifully made you can tell it was an art. 

We sat outside on the patio which overlooked Bloor street and it was a beautiful crisp fall day. They have heaters. 

Stars off for the bad service from our actual waiter. She never really looked at us and always seemed rushed like we weren't worth her while."}
{"text":"Waitress with a terrible attitude, very noisy.  Trying to be hip but the nice décor cannot compensate for mediocre food."}
{"text":"3 stars for food and ambiance. Stellar service could have bumped it up by another star but unfortunately, our server made us feel unwelcome with his disinterested glances, intentionally avoiding our table and keeping us waiting (yes, we noticed!). We asked for extra butter for the bread for our kids. 5 minutes. 10 minutes. No butter. We had to wait forever for him to return to take our order and even then we felt as if he were doing us a huge favour. The saving grace was the food. The mac and cheese worked out beautifully for my kids and my vegetarian pasta was seriously delicious. When we had finished our mains, our plates sat empty on our table for another long stretch of time. Server \"B\" passed many times, attending to other diners, but offered no attention to our table despite looking over several times and could plainly see that we were DONE. I ordered a coffee with my dessert but no sugar was brought over. This omission now reminds of an earlier one in our meal when my husband's steak arrived but without the necessary steak knife. When diners have to go asking for such basic items, the server is clearly not earning his tip. 

We loved the food however (note: skip the molten chocolate cake which tasted and looked microwaved) and are keen to try out their brunch. The young lady at the front of house deserves an honourable mention. She smiled and welcomed us right away by name (she was clearly paying attention when she took our reservation over the phone and we had given the heads up we were dining with kids) and helped us efficiently with our coats both on arrival and when we were leaving."}
{"text":"The room at La Societe has always been stunning. The bar as well. Now the food under Chef Avril is up to the decor. I only went for lunch but my girls and I we joyfully surprised by the high level of cooking. Perfect Croque Madam, a lovely full of flavour Onion Spup and tiny baby mussels in a winey broth. The service has risen a level and was warm and welcoming. I am looking forward to dinner."}
{"text":"One of the most over-rated restaurant of the city.

I use to be a fan of them and went regularly. Over the last 3 visits it's gone from personal and intimate to an upscale Suburban sportsbar. 

The staff are not well trained, the food has lost its quality, and the patrons are as loud as fvck. Maybe it's the loud club music playing...?!? Or the insistence of booking tables of 30+ diners. 

In the past I turned a blind eye to the uneven service, but this last visit sealed the deal. There are better places in the city worth visiting. The owners are riding on their coat tails and not actively trying to manage the location."}
{"text":"I've eaten at La Societe a few times now, and each outing has been solidly enjoyable, from the decor (I love the stained glass ceiling and tiled floor), to the service, to the impeccable food.

The prix fixe menu will keep me coming back because it's such a great value at about $36, but there are many a la carte items that I still plan to try. This evening I ordered the house salad, flat iron steak and chocolate cake. Previously I tried chilled tomato soup, heirloom tomato salad, mussels, cassoulet, and frites with garlic aioli. My favourites would probably be the mussels, flat iron steak, and frites.

The house salad was nice and crisp with french beans, but the creme fraiche dressing was a touch heavy-handed. I did not notice any of the advertised asparagus. The steak was very nice with no complaints (not overly-chewy -- my typical complaint for steak dishes), and I enjoyed the rich peppercorn sauce. The \"gateau au chocolat chaud\" was a lava chocolate cake with hazelnut ice cream and strawberries. It was a nice sedate ending to the meal, and very shareable.

I'd love to try out their brunch menu, especially once it becomes patio weather again in a short half-year or so! (They have patio heaters, which are actually quite hot to sit under, as I have experienced.)

Service is attentive without being obtrusive.
It can get pretty noisy with the after-work crowd, although one of the servers told me that Sunday and Monday nights are quieter.

Good for dates, family, and small groups (six and under). You have enough options to choose from affordable to pricey meals, delicious all the same."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch today and can safely say it's one of the best brunch experiences in the city (IMO). The menu was amazing. Drink menu is great. The decor is stunningly beautiful. The music was great. Service was good. I would definitely recommend and return!

*Note: for the reviews that say service is slow, anytime I needed a new drink or we needed anything our server was around. There was one occasion when we grabbed another server for a fork or something and he was on it with no issues. They were all friendly as well. Zero complaints.

*Update: went back and service was REALLY REALLY slow. Like insane slow and one server gave 'tude about it when we asked politely if she could give us some coffee (20-25 minutes in). Our server apologized but it was still ridiculously slow. Bringing my 5 stars down to 3."}
{"text":"We were there last Sunday night.  Very quiet to our surprise.

It was our friends birthday.  

Probably cause is patio season, all the doors were open etc. Didn't feel the 'classy' feel I was expecting from 1920 France.

- We order steak, tuna salad, fish - not impressive
- For app, we had deep fried frog leg (it was ok), and ESCARGOTS

Service Score: 65

{"text":"Came here after we were unceremoniously turned away at Dominion Tavern because one of our party was below the drinking age. It was late and miserably hot. We wanted something light and entertaining.  We ate a plateau de fruits de mer and a charcuterie selection, a number of different single glasses of wine and desserts, tea and coffee. Finally a place I can relate to. Wonderful, grownup service with no rough edges. Comfortable lighting. Unobtrusive music, mostly jazz. Utensils, napery and bread deployed generously.  Menu hits all the bistro favorites and then throws in some delicious curve-balls to keep your attention. This is the first place I've dined at in a very long time where they can actually put together a dish which turns out eating better than it reads on the menu.  How many times have you ordered a charcuterie selection and have had a generous crock of mousseline de foie  presented as part of it? Never, right? Well, it happens here. The seafood guy is conducting a symphony in his head while constructing your plateau de fruits de mer - you hope that's a good sign, and it is. There's a brandy snifter stuffed with  tuna tartare balanced on top of your plateau as a finial. Desserts, also very  good, each one an individual, each offering something delicious and surprising, and no bought-in cheesecakes in sight, thank you very much."}
{"text":"This place has the best French onion soup ever. Good atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"We checked out La Societe (131 Bloor St W) during Winterlicious, when the restaurant had a 3 course prix fixe menu for $35. It's located on the second floor of Colonnade Plaza-known for housing high end retail like Cartier-just before Avenue Road, overlooking busy Bloor Street.

The décor is old time French glamour with a grand entrance, stained glass ceiling, chandeliers and red wood shelves. It's meant to resemble a Parisian bistro, and once inside it is almost like entering a different world outside the hustle and bustle of the city streets, yet refined and luxurious like the surrounding Yorkville neighbourhood itself.

For starters, we both had the Beef Crudo with shaved parmesan, pickled baby red onions, arugula and extra virgin olive oil. The beef was blue rare and sliced very thinly, making it a surprisingly light and refreshing appetizer.

For the main course, I had the Dry Aged Striploin with frites, watercress salad and Bernaise sauce. Though the steak was small, it was the perfect portion size. Taylor had the Parisian Gnocchi with sweet potato puree, chestnuts, brussel sprouts, in a brown butter sauce, which was rich yet perfectly fresh and portioned.

We normally don't get dessert at our favourite restaurants so this was a treat. For our sweet tooth cravings, I had the Chocolate Hazelnut Bar and Taylor had the Creme Brulee.

All of the dishes were small portions but with so many different plates, it proved to be the perfect amount.

The restaurant was full and extremely noisy, making it hard to hear each other and carry on a conversation. However, the service was very professional and the waitress was knowledgeable about the wine list, which was extensive (it is a French restaurant after all!)

Besides the amazing food and atmosphere, and is a great place for a romantic date night or fancy girls' night out. 

Next time you're in the mood for quality French cuisine that doesn't leave you stuffed and in a food coma, check out La Societe on Bloor!"}
{"text":"Was close to the hotel so I stopped in for an evening snack. Did not make it back to the hotel without puking my guts out. Not sure what it was but something was seriously bad with the food in this place."}
{"text":"We made reservations for brunch with a highchair for our child. When we arrived we were told they only had 1 highchair for the entire restaurant and it was in use. How can you open up a restaurant and only have 1 highchair? 
We just moved from San Francisco where every restaurant has multiple highchairs... What's up Toronto???? Do families with children not eat in this city???
 2 stars for what we saw of the ambiance before we left."}
{"text":"My rating is for brunch/lunch - it is delicious and lovely, and pretty quiet.  The restaurant is gorgeous, and the service is good.  Absolutely a great spot to enjoy a boozy brunch and afternoon, especially after spending the morning in Yorkville.  

Dinner time, especially on the weekends is too \"scene-y\" and packed for me."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding. The tuna tartar was incredible. The three stars is pertaining to the server who was visibly miffed when we asked to split our large party's bill into four to avoid the end-of-the-meal confusion. Also pertaining to them charging us 4$ pp to serve a birthday cake someone brought as a gift. After spending over $250 per couple before tip, charging to cut a cake and serve it is beyond tacky. 

La Société, you are like school in the summertime...nooooo class:-)"}
{"text":"Last Friday had a dinner there, and think that experience could've been better... The atmosphere was nice, steak tartar was good, good wine, but we constantly had to remind waiters for stuff we asked. 

Maybe next time I'll be luckier..."}
{"text":"Had winterlicious there it was a joke. Nothing was good at all. Had the winterlicious special. First came our appi, there was no flavour to it. I had the raw beef as my appi was not good at all. Next up my main course came out, let's just say I almost died laughing at the portion they gave you. I order the steak. And again there was no flavour. I asked for med rare and it came out med. the only great thing on that plate was the fries. Last up was dessert. I order crème brûlée and guess what. It was all coconut flavour not good at all. Hands down not a place I will go back. I know it's winterlicious but come on. Get your game on!!!"}
{"text":"I went to La Societe for brunch today with my girlfriend.  All I can say to anyone thinking of going here - save your money and do not step foot into this place.  My friend and I had the worst experience ever at a restaurant.  Where do I even begin....

First we get in, we were never allocated a server.   We sat there for about 10 minutes before the greeting guy saw us and came up to take our order (still no waiter for us).  Once we ordered it took 30 minutes for us to get our drinks.  Then it took us in total 47 minutes to get our food.  No one was in the restaurant also.  What the hell were to cooks doing? Taking a nap.  Anyways, we get our food and of course it is beyond hopeless.  My friend's egg benedict was over cooked and there was a HAIR in the hollandaise sauce.  GROSS!!!!  This is supposed to be a so called 5 star bloor street restaurant.  Whatever....Then we call over the manager and we get some stuck up prima donna freak to tell us what our options were, of course without even saying sorry for the hair.  Once she took our food, I made a joke and said 'I hope no one spits in our food'...of course she  didn't take it as a joke and started yelling at us saying \"I have respect for people!!! I would never do that, How dare you?  Woah lady relax , calm down it was a joke.  Anyways, I think this place thrives on the bloor street hype and attracts the same lame customers as their regulars...it's only about time before this overhyped restaurant with their weird  zombie like waiters, loses its appeal."}
{"text":"Short and Sweet is the way I'll go. I've only been for brunch/breakfast but it was 6 stars out of 5! Waffles have sides of (homemade) Maple Crème, Whipped cream and Maple Syrup. But what really takes the cake is the frites. So heavenly! Absolutely delish! And the garlic aioli side beside it is tres bien 
Very pricey but in the end very worth it. I go about 1-2 times a year which is like $200 bucks for five people!"}
{"text":"This has been one of the worst restaurant experience for me! Definitely not a place anyone should even bother considering to go to. We've planned to celebrate a friend's birthday at this particular restaurant because of the pictures we saw of it on its website. When I made the reservation 1 day in advance by calling them over the phone - specifically asking for a circular booth table for a party of three, the representing staff of this restaurant said \"Sure, that's not a problem.\"  So when we arrived at the restaurant yesterday night and told the hostess about our reservation, she said because they have other larger parties, all the booths were given out to them and we can only be seated at a regular table! I then explained to her that we specially asked for a booth table when we made our reservation, she then stated that it is their restaurant's policy that - \"these sort of seating request are just request and they are not guaranteed. And since there are larger parties than you guys, we have to accommodate them.\" I find this totally ridiculous as the person who took our reservation said \"Sure, that's not a problem\" when we called 1 day in advance! The hostess then continued to say to us they only have regular tables and we can wait for a booth table to be freed up later. So basically, the impression she gave us was that given that we are only a party of 3, they don't give a damn about us and take whatever seats we have now or you can leave. I find it totally unprofessional of La Societe to treat their customers with such little respect. First of all, the person who took our reservation DID not tell us that our request was only a request and that we would not be given a booth seat if they have other \"more important\" customers! And second, they could have simply called us to let us know we wouldn't get a booth table when their \"more precious\" customers walked in that evening. Then, we wouldn't even bother making a trip to the restaurant! When i talked to another staff at the restaurant about this incident, his response was like \"there's nothing we can do\" and he tried to bring up how it's the restaurant's policy that they cannot guarantee a booth table for us even if we request it! But seriously, why would I know about YOUR Restaurant's policy when the staff who took our reservation made it sound like we were guaranteed a booth table?? It's just completely irresponsible and disrespectful for the way they have treated us! Because of their disrespectful arrangement, our night was ruined. We walked out of the restaurant because we find that the way they have handled the situation was completely unacceptable. NO apologies was given and their attitude was not pleasant either. With the way they treat their customers, don't even bother thinking of going! If I were to spend a coupe hundred of dollars on a meal, I expect the restaurant to at least treat us with respect and delivering on giving a booth seat that we have specifically asked for and agreed to for it! If ZERO stars was an option, I would have chose that no doubt! NO matter how good your food is, the basic requirement for a restaurant is to treat your customers with respect. This establishment definitely doesn't know how or at least, doesn't care to.  There are plenty of nice restaurants in the Yorkville area and I definitely would recommend any other places out there other than La Societe!"}
{"text":"I just got home from one of the most terrible dining experiences of my life. This was my third time at La Société and despite two prior and pleasant experiences, I am so baffled by the amount of disrespect I experienced from our waiter and, subsequently, from the manager that I will most certainly never return. 

Things started off terribly when my friend and I, while awaiting two other dining guests, kept getting bombarded by the waiter forcing us to purchase a drink. We told him we were interested in the Cava but were awaiting our other friends. He proceeded to push an entire bottle of Cava on us, saying that he thought we would really enjoy it. We thanked him and asked him to give us some time until our friends arrived. He came back not once but twice pushing the Cava bottle on us again and after our third time asking him to wait for our friends, he responded \"OK, I will put it on ice for you\". 

When our friends arrived, we ordered the Cava and decided to skip appetizers and go straight to mains. One of my friends asked the waiter if he recommended the steak tartare or the gnocchi. He abruptly answered \"the tartare, but let me get you guys a plate of gnocchi!\" with so much pressure and awkwardness that none of us felt comfortable enough to say no. 

Our meals were fine and normally I would rate this place much higher but the subsequent experience of getting the bill was so horrendous that I could never justify anything more than 1 star. We asked that he split the entirety of the bill by 4 and give me 2 of the bills to take care of. He was so incompetent and came back, rudely, saying he was unable to split the bottle of Cava. When we offered to do the math and have him simply charge specific amounts on our respective credit cards, he jetted off in an attempt to fix the bills, only to return and, once again, have incorrect bills. Finally we had to teach him how to insert the proper amounts correctly, at which point he started to become extremely jumpy and even stated \"I have 10 other tables right now, we're going to have to do this my way\". I was so offended by his treatment towards us. 

To make matters worse, my credit card didn't seem to be working properly and instead of gently trying it again or communicating with me about it, he kept aggressively shoving it in and out of the machine and quickly stated \"do you have another one?\". My friend ended up covering my bill as there was no opportunity to see why the card wasn't working. 

When I came home, I was so taken aback by this horrible experience that I contacted the manager, Chris. I explained all the upselling and rude behaviour and he assured me that this would be escalated. I sensed a hint of insincerity in his voice though. He offered to \"give us the red carpet treatment\" the next time we go but failed to get my phone number. I will never be going back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I have been to this place numerous times, although the few times before were mediocre, the last time was a complete nightmare that I almost never want to go back.

Beautiful place, food is decent, but the service there is HORRIFIC. I know I happened to have gotten a bad waitress that day, but it left such a bad taste in my mouth I vow never to go back again. 

My waitress not only took forever to come back to my table to take my order, she ended up giving me the wrong menu! She didn't even say sorry and just asked if I can pick something else from their bar section. She could not have cared less about her customers as the whole time she was looking for her co-workers and ran to them to chat after. I ordered the sliders (cost me $21) and they took forever to come as well. Unhappy, another waiter noticed my bad mood and came by and offered me free watermelon lemonade and gave me a $6 discount on the bill. 

I was left disappointed. The bad service took away from the food tasting fresh."}
{"text":"La Société, I will miss you.  I will miss you being on the second floor of the apartment building, with your amazing selection of oysters and delicious seared foie gras which we no longer have in California.

Beautiful female servers (I can say this in Canada, maybe?), divine food, ambiance, elegant decor and such a diverse selection of Canada's finest locales.  Relaxed but lively crowd.

Tuesdays, Wednesdays and ooh la la Thursdays are the best days to go.  A must dine sort of place in Toronto."}
{"text":"Bistro La societe

If you're up for a bistro flare, lunch at Bloor Street's own La Societe. 
Can't beat their salade nicoise, topped with purple potatoes, green beans and crusted seared tuna - all done to perfection!
Looking for love? Add-on some marinated olives or the homemade foie gras. 
What we love...the classic Parisian bistro feel, the raw bar: market oysters & seafood towers and oh so close to every designer shop in town!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. From the tile floors to the amazing stained class ceiling - the ambience is insane.

I got the hamburger with aged cheddar and it was perfection. It came with matchstick salty fries and a pickle aioli (which is a game changed). Why did I just find this place now?"}
{"text":"C'est trop bon! So good! Reasonably priced too. Spent about three hours there enjoying the atmosphere and most importantly the food !!! Had the croque Madame and mille-feuille. Definitely have to go back and try the rest of the dishes as I couldn't order everything on the menu !"}
{"text":"Wandering around during the Bloor Street party, last Sunday, I was drawn to the patio in the courtyard of the Colonnade building, so we wandered in for some light fare. It had been a long while since anything interesting drew me towards the Colonnade ... 

Turns out, the downstairs patio at La Societe only offers beer, wine, and oysters (at least, that's all they had on offer last Sunday), so we migrated to the top patio for the soups (the French Onion is amazing, as was their truffle-infused mushroom  soup), but not before savouring a half-dozen of the best PEI Malpeques I have had since I moved to Toronto 16 years ago.

We finished the meal off with the dessert sampler, and made some reservations for future visits. (The macarons are not Nadege quality, but still enjoyable; the truffles and jellies were a lovely contrast, and genuine stars in their own right).

The service was stellar on both patios (possibly a bit too eager on the street-level patio, but the staff with settle down, as they get used to their new environment), and the atmosphere was relaxed and unpretentious, not easy to do dropped in the middle of so much luxe.

I expect this will be a regular hunt for me over the summer and beyond. There is loads of seating, and they are even open late into the night. Hope to bump into you there."}
{"text":"Disappointed for the food. Not getting the quality for what I paid for when compared to other French restaurants in town. The stained glasses aren't that \"wow\" either."}
{"text":"Decor: 4/5 (even though not my taste)
Service: 1/5
Food: 1/5

Service: 
- reservation for 12pm. Didn't get seated until 12:30pm as hostess and manager kept making excuses about table will be ready in 5 more mins, cleaning up etc. Forget the excuses, just own up to the fact you didn't manage the reservations well.

- order was not taken for a good 20 mins after we sat down. One drink was missing from order but we didn't bother since we knew the service was already lacking

- food delivered by runners. Main server came to ask if \"everything's ok\" when we were on our last bite. A little late...

- asked for bill, waited another 20 mins.

Food:
- terrible.

- will save the details, but since when was steak tartar a greyish color?

- raspberry mille feuille reaks of pork since I'm presuming due to the low quality lard used to make the pastry.

Normally I don't bother to leave a long review, but this deserved it.

Absolutely terrible and will not be returning even if they were to invite us back on their dime.

Should've known better...another Khabouth restaurant...all style no substance."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful. The service is considerably better in the dining lounge and on the patio than it was in the bar. The food was top notch. Pricey but worth it. This place would be amazing for a date."}
{"text":"I will never be coming back here!
Went for $1 oyster night, got there no one told us about the difference prices between sitting at the bar to sitting at the regular dinning area, received my bill and for 2 dozen oyster I was charge $78!!!! When I asked about the dollar oyster on my bill the waitress got the manager to come and the friggin dick said exactly \" because this always happens, not to say you did this before as many people have; I can charge half of your bill to the $1 oyster deal and also we will be losing money if we gave you the whole bill as we gave you expensive oysters\" 
To me, as a customer if you did not tell us nor have the curtousy to mention while we were there you should of sucked it up and gave us the $1 deal!!! Customer service sucks and food was not to good as we also ordered food. 


NEVER GOING BACK!!! WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND FRIENDS HERE!!"}
{"text":"I've been searching for a great Coq Au Vin in Toronto for years and this is the best one I've tasted so far! The red wine sauce was rich, the chicken was incredibly tender and it had just the right amount of pearl onions and mushrooms. It was a dish Julia Child would be proud of. 

The Roasted & Pickled Beets Salad ($14) was a colourful and appetizing dish. I loved the chevre and thought the ice wine infused cranberries were a nice touch.

The tuna Tartare ($22) was a very generous portion of yellow fin, but was a bit over-salted for my palate. The apple and pine nuts added great flavour and crunch to the dish.

The Classic Creme Brulee ($12) was my fave dessert (mainly because I take great pleasure in smashing the crisp shell). The fruit provided just the right amount of acidity to breakup the spoonfuls of rich, smooth custard."}
{"text":"Well my friend and I had a fantastic experience here for my birthday starting with our super cute, super charming server. We kept grabbing his attention away from his other tables . We both had the summerlicious prix fixe and started with the Jambon and the summer salad. Both were excellent, we loved the dressing on the salad and the jambon (prosciutto) and melon was very refreshing. For mains we both had the steak frites. The fries were really good, they had tarragon on them which gave a great flavour. We ordered our steaks medium rare and they were definitely over cooked but still not bad, we didn't bother sending them back. For deserts we had peach crème brulée and blueberry pudding. Both came with an awesome cream cheese ice cream; I would have been happy with just a big bowl of that stuff, so yummy. The crème brulée was the favourite of the two, and our server did tell us that it's better than the blueberry pudding,  but I just can't say no to a blueberry. That said, I did enjoy the pudding. We sat inside as it was windy but I would love to come back and spend an afternoon on that terrace patio, it's so cute and has a great street view. Solid 4 stars, 5 if the steak had been a true medium rare."}
{"text":"Ohh la la .. La Societe is the new 'see and be seen' hotspot opened in time for patio season and will certainly be a destination for Toronto film fest.  It has taken over the former location of Dynasty Chinese restaurant on bloor and the lower courtyard patio as well making it the only patio and large restaurant in the new renovated stretch of Bloor attracting the shoppers, tourists, whos who and wannabe 'socialites'. 
With powerhouse design house Munge Leung behind this, the space has been transformed with a $4M dollar makeover and no expense overlooked to turn the room into a stunning dining area with a head-turning stained glass ceiling, a stylish glowing bar room and two large hopping patios.  One street level that serves a reduced' bar menu' and one that is elevated that overlooks pedestrians as they stroll by on the sidewalk.
This french brasserie has all the classics from duck a l'orange, french onion soup, rich pates, foie, steak frites and steak tartare.  However les fruits de mer, seafood selection, is the highlight here!  Fresh oysters, clams, fish, lobsters are on display in their raw bar inside the restaurant for the picking.  
That being said, I would finish dinner elsewhere and go there for the people watching and a cocktail."}
{"text":"I came for Winterlicious 2015.

Decor, the place is very well decorated if you look at some pictures.  Nice booth seats, nice decor, it has a very impressive stain glass ceiling light, lots of semi-abstract artwork.  One oddity I found was that coat check leaves your coats on racks outside the restaurant which means people could just grab them although the hostess is able to see them.

Food, I order the chicken liver mousse (I wasn't a fan, my girlfriend liked it), the braised short rib which I thought was very good, very tender and a good size and finished with the creme brulee which was really good as well.

Service, the service was up and down due to the number of people per wait staff.  When our waitress was free, she was very good with filling drinks, asking us about the meal and taking our plates when we were done.  When she wasn't free, we could see that she was busy with other guests, so it wasn't a deal breaker for us but I think they were a bit understaffed.

I'd return for a regular meal based on what I saw and had.  You do get complimentary parking downstairs with your visit, so no need to street park or find the green p parking lots."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times. Its a pricey restaurant but the food is not that great. I got the chicken and it wasn't cooked properly. The meat was a bit raw. My sister also got the Gnocci and it was OK. The safest bet is to get a burger. The environment is good so as the service. But remember if you want to sit outside make sure you go to the second floor as the first floor (patio) has a different and smaller menus and funny enough they don't bring foods from the regular menus to the first floor. Basically you cannot order from the regular menu if you are sitting on the first floor patio."}
{"text":"The food is good (but very pricey), service friendly but wait ... is that very loud dance and techno music pounding away for hours in a \"French Bistro\"   - zero ambiance b/c of the dumb choice in music. Yep - girl at the front says music is carefully selected by management (club owners) & I think the crowd they are attracting doesn't care. They just want to impress their dates with expensive VIP room champagne - who needs conversation baby?"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal and attentive service! Quinoa salad with grilled octopus and brusell sprouts. The salad was light with a nice citrus finish. The octopus was done perfectly (not overcooked) and the brusell sprouts were baked not boiled. Overall a very nice meal and enjoyable time."}
{"text":"It's a facade with no substance. It's a beautiful space but the food and service is below average. I've been here twice and both times, the service has been average to unacceptable.  We arrive without an available table and was left at the bar for at least 30 mins completely unattended to or clearing a table for us to seat in when it was clearly in our vision. When seated, how many times does it take to get an order? Seems like 3-5 times. The waitress was so inapt, she'll take one person order and leave. How long do you need to wait for water. 30mins.  The waitstaff here all look like they hate their job. The food is not much to talk about. It's casual bistro food at twice the price. For the location and price, you would expect much better."}
{"text":"Désolée La Société, but you are on my black list! I only wish there's a 0-star option on Yelp!

I've been there a couple of times and the quality just kept going down every time I went there. It went from a decent overpriced French restaurant to complete garbage. Last time I went there I had some minor food poisoning symptoms after eating their oysters. I feel regretful that I've decided to give it a second chance, only to receive a worse experience. Honestly I don't expect them to stay open for a long time.

This time we went there for Sunday lunch and it was one of my worst restaurant experiences. First of all the food was pretty bad. We had the onion soup and the tuna tartar for appetizers. My friend's soup had a really weird taste: salty, fishy, and a combination of all the disgusting things you can think of. My tuna tartare was also very unfresh and salty and stinky, and at the bottom of the food - there was a very short hair that's probably an eyelash or an eyebrow hair that I'm 80% sure it's not mine.

And the main dishes, the eggs benedict? Oh, we don't know, because we sat there for 1 hour, they still didn't come after the waitress promised they would come \"in a minute\" twice, we just left $40 (for the worst appetizers ever) on the table and left the restaurant!

We are not the only ones having complaints. The table sitting next to us called the manager over to ask why it's taking so slow; the table next to us waited 1 hour for the food to come and left angrily saying it's \"ridiculous\" and \"waste of time and money\"; the two tables behind us were constantly complaining about the lack of service.

And somehow - they have the most staff I've ever seen! Every couple of minutes we see a new waitstaff face passing by, just walking around looking absent-minded and inattentive to customers...

Seriously, why are people still eating here? Why?"}
{"text":"Located on the second floor of an office building on Bloor, La Societe is a great brunch spot if you are looking for something a bit fancier. The staff are great and extremely informative regarding the menu options; however, I do think that the food is a bit lacklustre for the price and setting of the restaurant. 

My friend and I ordered the Lobster Sandwich and the C\"s Burger. Both orders tasted good, but that was about it ... good. For the price point I would really be expecting these options to taste great. My friend's Lobster Sandwich had some great chunks of lobster inside, but it was a fairly small portion that could be easily devoured. 

Overall, I think this place is worth visiting, but I don't see it as somewhere I return to on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I cannot rave about this place enough.

Its amazing. If I could eat and drink there every night I would. 

I've been there for brunch, lunch, dinner and pure drinks, and each and everytime I've left happy and with a smile on my face.

Heres why:

(1) Ambiance: 10/10. This place is truly amazing. Dont let the fact that its located inside a mini plaza fool you. Its truly \"French\". From the melting candle sticks to the flower arrangements, to the glass ceilings... its all just perfect. The place gets a lot of light, because its located on the upper level, but never too much light. the vibe is definaetely differs when its brunch v. dinner.  At dinner the place is romantic and gorgous, with the back bar, darkly lit and mysterious. For brunch, the place gets alot of natural light, and so its beautifully lit up and comfortable, while at the same time imminating a sense of luxury.

(2) Service: 10/10. The servers are incredible here. They are sweet, professional and never judgemental. As a vegaterian I appreciate them warning me about foods that may contain animal products like chicken stock. They also go out of their way to make you happy. I always leave a generous tip because they deserve it.

(3) Food and Wine: again 10/10. I go here for brunch almost every weekend, and I've tried the eggs bennis so many different ways, as well as the amazing French Toast. My partner always gets the braised short ribs with the poached egg, which looks wonderful but I havent tried. did I mention it has wine sauce?! 

(4) Value: the most important thing here is value. this place is underpriced for the kind of food you are getting. rich but not overwhelming, tastey but not heavy. its awesome. 

Im quite picky and I cant find anything wrong with this place. try it try it try it."}
{"text":"The french onion soup was very rich.  If I were to Order it again, would have ordered with more cheese

Otherwise, the lobster BLT and the burger were amazing.  Of course, also had a glass of patron....mmmm

Be sure to go to this gem"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! Make sure when you go you put on the Ritz or else you will feel really out of place, the ceiling in the main dinning room is STUNNING, there is always champagne on ice right in the dinning room so you do not have to wait their wine list is extremely extensive. The food here is excellent, love, love, love their steaks! They also have a delicious seafood bar that will just make your mouth water! The bar area is cozy, very very french feeling every where you go in this restaurant, the only real criticism I have of this restaurant is that it is a french restaurant that plays North American music? I wish they played french music!!! This restaurant is definitely not kid friendly even though they have a kids portion on the menu. Make sure you make a reservation! Overall an excellent restaurant, perfect for your regular haunt of a special evening with your girlfriend/boyfriend or out with friends!"}
{"text":"Sad to say this but I have to downgrade my star rating for this place. 

I came here with some friends who were visiting Toronto and I chose to come here because of the good experience I had last time (last review).  

First, I made a reservation as it was Father's Day but I still had to wait over 30 minutes to get a seat.  Really?  That shouldn't happen with a reservation even if it was Father's Day.  

Second, I reordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict because I enjoyed it so much last time but it was much, much smaller than I remembered.  In my previous review, I wrote how it came with a salad and delicious potatoes but the plate that I got this time had 1 measly piece of bread with 2 poached eggs atop with hollandaise sauce and then a few potatoes on the side.  What?  Really?  They couldn't give me two pieces of bread for my two eggs? What happened? And for the same price too? I wasn't even full.  

I was and still am SO disappointed. And so were my friends.  Sorry La Societe, I don't know what happened to your dishes but I certainly can't recommend you anymore."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but the experience ruined by the hostesses at the front.  Be prepared to be judged if your not formally dressed and wearing stilettos.  Overall, this restaurant wants to be something that it is not.  The staff with chips on their shoulder because their not working in yorkville proper."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place only has 3.5 stars. I think it is truly awesome. The decor is fantastic and very authentic. I loved the atmosphere. Casul and not stuffy yet really fun and nice at the same time.

In terms of food I can't recommend the steak tartare more. Truly delicious. The oysters were awesome too but definitely not as great as the steak tartare. The french fries are the best fries that I have ever hard in my life. Not kidding. The steak was extremely good but not extreme. The duck confit was extreme - totally the bomb. The butternut squash tart was also very good but not extreme. The cassoulet was terrific but not as good as the duck confit. 

So....bottom line: order the steak tartare and the duck confit and the french fries. You will be happy. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm big on consuming food and drinks at the bar.. and they have a good looking bar and the bar staff is pretty attentive. I'm here a lot for the $1 oysters on Thurs.. make sure to ask for their wine vinaigrette that accompanies it.. they used to serve it with the oysters but now you have to ask for it.

Had the eggs benedict for brunch.. the food looked better instagrammed than it tasted. 

The one thing I really miss about the place- They used to have Veuve Clicquot nights.. Wish they would bring it back."}
{"text":"My first Yelp review! =)

My roommates and I walk by this place pretty much everyday so we finally decided to just sit down and have some drinks after dinner tonight. 

We started off on the downstairs patio and when we started ordering, the waitress said that the upstairs patio had a broader drink menu and suggested we go up (we think there's some weird technicality with open alcohol outside that they can't bring drinks up and down the stairs). We didn't want to be dicks since she had already brought us our waters, but she was fine with it, which was nice.

So we went upstairs and the ambiance is really nice. The staff was really welcoming; the ones who weren't assigned to our table still stopped by to talk to us. We just stuck with typical drinks and dessert for a couple hours, but as we were about to leave, two of my roommates decided to get the $25 French 125 on the drink menu. The description says \"it will hit you like a cannon\" and our waiter himself said he had one tonight and it hit him hard (he DID seem kind of tipsy). It uses Dom Perignon for the champagne, chartreuse for the taste, and some other random stuff in the mix. I had a sip and it was really interesting. The chartreuse overwhelms everything, but you can still tell the champagne is there. It was quite strong and my roommates couldn't really down it so we ended up sticking around for a while.

Overall, a great end to our night and very happy that we finally decided to drop in."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a few friends on a Sunday evening. The food was okay, I've had better for the price. The food isn't expensive but it is overpriced. The portions are small and the food is generally bland. 
The service here is the worst. The hostess seemed annoyed that we were waiting in the lobby, the waiter was no where to be seen for most of the time that we were there. He was unpleasant and never checked in on us until we got up to ask for the check.
This place has a great atmosphere but I don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"Very good food and friendly service. Mussles especially recommended and if you are burger fan, you will like their take on it. Great wine selection, but you expect riesling to be available by the glass when in Toronto."}
{"text":"Made a reservation but wasn't seated till 20mins later, when group with same head count which came after us already went in.

Food was average, pretty cheap option given the area.

Service was terrible, our order was taken 25 minutes after we sat down... 

Even if I am in the area... will not go back. I rather pay the price and get treated right at other restaurants in the area"}
{"text":"Went for summerlicious so my expectations were lower than where they would have been had I went on a regular night, but I just had to write about how bad the service was.

Waited about 15 minutes before the server even acknowledged us
Had to ask for the wine list (since we weren't given one), which was finally given to us right after our appetizers arrived
No bread, though almost every table around us was given bread
The server did not ask us how we wanted our steaks cooked
After I was a third of the way into my incredibly tiny steak (which was merely warm, not hot), the steak knives finally arrived. Frites were quite good. But should the frites of a steak frites dish really be outshining the steak? I would think not.
Never once did anyone ask how everything was
No offer of coffee or tea when we ordered dessert

Thankfully the manager did knock our drinks off the bill as I felt the need to complain for the first time in years (the drinks were a redeeming factor as they were good).
I understand that the wait staff loathes summerlicious, but this was just appalling.

Though the place is very nice looking and the regular menu also looked like it had some good dishes on it, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food is just OK.  Ambience and venue is good.  Service is below average.   Prices are ridiculously high based on the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I went for a summerlicious dinner with 4 colleagues on a Wednesday night.  We were thoroughly dissapointed with the quality of the steaks. Out of the 4 steaks, none were cooked to the requested degree. The fries and crème brûlé were decent. The oysters were fairly good. Service seemed rushed and impersonal at first, but improved  throughout our stay - they consistently confused our orders though. On the plus side, they did provide my colleague with a complementary drink because her original one was not good. The ambience and decor were quite sophisticated. Due to the quality of the food in relation to the price however, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"One dollar oysters in the bar area on Thursday nights - my reason to return.  

The ambience is great in both the dining and bar area, however, I prefer the bar area just because I find the people there more relaxed and cool.  The people in the dining area tends to sit more straight with perfect dining etiquette (which is fine if you're meeting the queen or having dinner with your future ex-husband), but if you just want to hang out and socialize with friends, the bar is where the fun happens.  

The escargot can be a bit salty depending on your palette, but delectable none the less.  My favourite dish is the tuna tartare...I'm salivating at the thought of it. Pasta is great here as well.  I've been here many times (bar, not dining) and I must say, I was never disappointed with the food.  The desserts are incredible.  It can get busy and really loud, and perhaps you will have to hunt down a server yourself, but great place to go for a glass of wine, raw oysters and delicious food with your friends."}
{"text":"La Societe went from being one of my favorite restaurants in the city to being one of the worst, in one swift phone call. 

This phone call occurred 2 days before Mother's Day when someone had the nerve to call me and 'remind' me of their 1.5 hour seating limit (something that does not exist!). I had to stifle my laughter and ask what this meant, much to my dismay it meant they were calling to confirm what time I was leaving the restaurant. TWO DAYS, before I even arrived. 

When I told the staff on the phone that this was rude (and ridiculous) she reminded me that they were busy (not my problem, and nor do I care) and asked how long I anticipated being there. Well, my answer was \"As long as I please, just like every other time I've visited your establishment and stayed for hours and hours on end\", she asked if I would be OK with 2 hours. I was flabbergasted, if I'm in a restaurant for longer than 1.5 hours, I'm clearly spending money, money of which La Societe has no issue taking every other day of the year. 

When I called back to speak to a manager, I was again reminded that they were busy. I informed the manager that it was not Sunday yet and he may very well be swamped, but they've now ruined their reputation with a customer who frequents their restaurant more than once a year. All because they think it's acceptable to put a time limit on someones meal, I cancelled my reservation and have not, and will not, ever return.

I gladly found a substitute that let me and my guest sit, eat, and drink all afternoon. A substitute that didn't call me prior to my reservation to do anything other then confirm that I could make the reservation. 

As a side note, I understand if people sit around after their done, taking up space. I am not one of those people, not to mention if a server has an ounce of experience, there is a way to deal with these types of diners and subtly close out their bill to make way for the next customer. Perhaps, something that should've been considered before calling regular customers and putting a limit on how long they're at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and fell in love with the decor. The French waiter was super attentive without being intrusive and the food was fab. Shared the ceviche to start which was nice (but being from the East Coast I've had better). The highlight was the mains though. My steak tartare avec frites was on par with the best I've had in France. And the vanilla creme brulee dessert? Heavenly."}
{"text":"Terrific service, mediocre bland food. At best a three-star selection but when you factor in the price, it's a two. Ahh, it may be a two without the price factor."}
{"text":"My mother was in town for the weekend. I was looking for a nice brunch place through yelp...and settle with La Societe. It starts off pretty good, there place is not too crowded. Nice atmosphere. I had the egg benedict. The food was pretty good. My mom really likes it. The waiter was lacking proper servicing etiquette but he was nice. So, no big deal. And, after we paid the bill, we were rush out. My mom had to use the washroom. We sat at the table and waited for her return. At the meantime, we were told to leave the table because they have to prepare for the next sitting. I would think they can wait 5min for us to leave properly! I was very upset with that. That is a huge no-no for me. First for all, the service was slow, it toke the waiter quite a while to get us the bill. Secondly, there was no one at the front waiting for a table, hence, they could of wait for us to leave.  Thirdly, we didn't \"hang around\" for hours, we were there for about an hour and half, which I think is reasonable allocation of time for a brunch sitting. Not impress...Fail! I admit.....maybe One star is probably a bit harsh. But I am still quite upset with my experience, hence, they FAIL in my book!"}
{"text":"As I have mentioned, I am looking for a place that reminds me of Paris and this place was pretty close. Not as tight (as in elbow room) as some Parisian restaurants but the atmosphere was awesome. Very French Bistro. We went here for dinner and had the Duck Terrine, mushroom soup, Steak frites, and the creme brûlée.  SOOOO GOOD.  I think I have found my French place."}
{"text":"@LaSocieteTO is wanna be a posh place supposedly with such a poor manners.  Fire Mark. You already losing patrons due to the constructions cause the place was empty last night and then this waiter decided to be so dismissive.  His eye contact for a professional waiter (I am assuming he's been doing this for a long time) was so beyond pale. I work by your location and will spread the word. Could not risk of chocking on the food after that waiter's attitude made us lose our appetite? The manager was not better either. Seriously, maybe business is down but people cannot enjoy food if you are all so clinical and with dead faces! The chef sells the food. The house sells the energy and the ambience! How do you ever get anyone to comeback? @failed!

Nice location. Not sure about the food but the meno seemed too big for a posh place and the waiter and the manager could use a more training about their jobs and how to treat the patrons so a) they may come back. b) spread the experience. c) enjoy the dinner in peace!

I lost my appetite after encountering these people who stuck in the 70 social behavioiurs of thinking they can get away with being so rude and judging!
The funniest thing was he threatened that he could have do something with my phone (after I forgot it on the phone)...are you kidding me? Just Wow!"}
{"text":"Had 5 drinks with a friend at the bar before dinner. Cost around 70. Paid 100$. 

Dinner was average. French onion soup was the highlight. Shrimp cocktail was small, beef bourg was a 5/10.  I got some bad news and had to rush out. Waiter brought the bill. It was $180 including tax.  I have 200$ cash on me so I dropped in and quickly left. THE WAITER FOLLOWED ME OUT AND WAS YELLING AT ME AS I WALKED AWAY.  I COULDNT MAKE OJT WHAT HE WAS SAYING UNTIL THE END WHEN HE TOLD ME TO NEVER COME BACK. ILL BE TAKING HIS ADVICE. I understand 12% tip after tax isn't the best tip you've gotten, but it's not the worst. You don't know my situation. I had to leave quickly.  The fact that he followed me out and yelled after me should have him fired.  If I wasn't in a rush I would have gone back and caused a scene. What an asshole."}
{"text":"My sister and I always do brunch here as she lives across the street. We love it and are always happy when we leave. Of course we feel sad because we ate so many carbs but the food is so good! And they have gluten free options for my sister."}
{"text":"Disappointing dinner experience. We had a large group for dinner. Waited over 1 hour for our main courses to arrive. Spoons were not given for soups. Side orders of fries were forgotten for several people's meals. 

I really enjoyed the mushroom soup as well as the fries. However, the rest of the food was mediocre. Nobody at our table was wow'ed by any of the food.

Atmosphere is nice but prices are high for what you get. 

I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Food is good not horrible, but not amazing either. The service is the worst experience ever!  Our waitress was the rudest woman I've ever seen. She rolled her eyes at us, ignored us, and had the worst attitude ever. Nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential, it is such a shame that the service seems completely clueless. I went on weeknight for drinks and a bite, the person seating us was confused about which tables were free and just told us to find space at the bar. When we sat at the bar, servers kept brushing past us not bothering to apologize. This did mean we got to see the food going out, did not look appetizing at all. The only person who seemed to care about customers was the bartender. We decided just to have a cocktail and leave to get food somewhere else. 

I had expected more based on having been to the LS in Montreal, which is miles better."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant but very loud and noisey in the main dining room. The bar was better. Loved the tuna tartare app. Main course of salmon had huge portions. Other people at the table had the 8ounce burger. Wine list was great with every price range accounted for."}
{"text":"Thursdays, Melpeques for a dollar and beer!  Give me $100 worth.  Nice crowd too.

Big patio outside, inside has some ambiance and the crowd is bustling and alive.  Great location

I will have to try the food sometime, but don't know if I will since it's more of an oyster bar.  They also seem to server market fresh seafood judging by the ice display setup.

The service is overall OK.  Our waitress seemed a little disinterested."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner the other night, making it just in time before things got out of hand with the dinner rush. I can't believe this used to be the Chinese resto whose name I forget. The space has been transformed into a French bistro, which was very nice.

It was the end of a long week and thinking too hard about what I wanted to have seemed like a real chore, especially with all the choices on the menu, so we both got the prix fixe for $36 each, plus we had a few glasses of wine.

For starters, we got the duck liver terrine which was filling for a starter (not complaining!), and full of flavour. I also ordered the mushroom soup which was piping hot and served in a covered, classic soup bowl (didn't check for the lion's head), which was a nice touch. The soup tasted like it was made of morel mushrooms, was very creamy and delicious. I only wish there were chunks of mushroom in there. 

My friend ordered the lamb shank which was a nice sized portion. I didn't try any but apparently it was quite good. I opted for the pan-seared trout Grenoboise, which was the real star of the show~ Everything about the dish was GREAT: the skin was perfectly crispy, flesh cooked just right, and all the right flavours and textures (lemon, capers, etc) made this a stand-out dish, despite its simplicity. The butter-soaked crouton-like cubes of bread were super-rich and luscious but after a few of those in a row, I decided I ought to to restrain myself. Too much of a good thing, after all... One detail I notice they missed is that they don't seem to serve their fish with a proper fish knife. Not to be snobby or anything but it's one of those weird things that probably only I would notice~! Anyway...

For dessert, we had tea (they serve Mighty Leaf) and one of each: creme brulee whose top crust was a little thicker than usual (ME LOVE!) and the espresso millefeuille, which tasted weird. I would avoid this one next time for sure; the cream (it was way too thick to be mousse) was very heavy and had a strange taste to it--not that it was old, just not tasty. 

One of the hostesses was kind of annoying, acting like she was too cool for school but our servers were amazing and attentive in just the right dose. Their patio was all set up that night but not yet open. Seating can be cramped upstairs, particularly in the front section, which I think they could really stand to arrange a little better, but all in all, I do recommend."}
{"text":"Great spot to try out. The patio was very cute and all of the servers were friendly. The service was really good and food was served pretty quickly. My group of 4 were seated and served, ate and paid in just over an hour. The waffles were amazing, the quiche was very fluffy and tasty, and the eggs Benedict were average. Overall, I would recommend visiting and I would go again as well."}
{"text":"We easily got a reservation for summerlicious on the same day (maybe that should've been a sign that the place wasn't really good). We had oysters, steak frites and creme brule. The steak was tiny! It's probably a portion you would feed a 6 year old. I've had the steak frite at this place before and the summerlicious steak frite was literally a third of the size compared to the normal menu. It was annoying because the menus didn't mention anything about different portion sizes. Service was just ok. We asked 2 different people for mayo and it came near the end of the meal. Overall, was very disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate with my friend and chose it for it's proximity to the ROM which we had planned to visit.  It was unsurprisingly busy for a Friday night but we were able to get seated right away, considering that we had a reservation. It was one of the hottest days of summer and their air-conditioning was not up to the task.  We had a table for two which felt a little hemmed in with the other diners too close for comfort. Three separate people who seemed to have different roles attended us.  Friday was champagne night and Veuve Cliqcuot was a definite must have.  We decided to order that with the Crème Brulee, which had good reviews.  Our mains were B.C. Salmon for  my friend and Trout Veronique for me, which were not disappointing.  Overall, the experience was overpriced.   But maybe that goes with the territory.  It's in Yorkville, after all."}
{"text":"Although the food was never poor, some days it is excellent and other days the same dishes would be just ok.

The service has the same inconsistency - from hostile to aloof. 

The coat rack is located outside of the restaurant in the hall of the building near the entrance which I find rather odd. I am not comfortable leaving my outwear like this.

I tried this place 5 times and gave up. Too bad as it is conveniently located and has so much potential."}
{"text":"Tried to come here for my birthday around 7/8pm. Boyfriend made reservations and was told over the phone that they served $1 oysters until 11pm. Asked if it was possible to sit at the bar and watch them get shucked (as this is possible at other spots in the city). When we arrived, hostess looked bored to tears, asked where we wanted to sit? Mentioned that we had requested a specific table. Hostess was very confused. Escorted us to the other side of restaurant near the kitchen. There was no open kitchen/area to view shucking. Whole restaurant was surprisingly dead for a Thursday night. We opted to sit on patio instead. 
Overall vibe was weird. Very unwelcoming. After a few minutes we were ready to order. Waitress informs us that there are no oysters left! Wtf?! That is the whole reason we came here. Long story short we left. This place was dead. Barely any customers and staff looked like they would rather be doing anything else. No birthday dinner for me :( definitely will never be back here. Ruined the day."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but between the salty French onion soup, the salty steak, the salty (and overcooked, dry) duck confit...I just couldn't. We ended our meal with the creme brûlée, which was surely better in theory, in the chef's mind. Too much coconut flavouring. 

The restaurant is indeed beautiful but the food is definitely not worth it. Looks like the brunch and the burgers are the top-rated dishes here. If that's the case, then please stop referring to yourself as a French restaurant. Thank goodness we had a gift certificate."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced, and not tasty or fresh. The most  disappointing part was the service. It took the waiter over 20 minutes to bring a cup of coffee and forget about asking for a second one as that took even longer..we had to go look for the waiter in order to get our check."}
{"text":"The 2 star, \"Meh, I've experienced better \" is pretty dead on here. Maybe it's because I came in with high expectations, or maybe because the service and food was indeed lousy. Regardless of which, it truly was a 2-star experience. 

To begin, it took around 20-25 minutes to receive a latte ordered right as we sat down.  25 MINUTES!! Our appetizer, the mac and cheese, was decent. The featured Lamb burger was mediocre (shoutout to T.I.), dry, and certainly not worth the cost. My friend's vegetable sandwich was left half-eaten, as she just couldn't suffer through any more of it. 

Service was horrible, did not get my water refilled once, pretty much got ignored until it was time to pay up.

On a positive note, the fries here are not frozen and was probably the best part of the meal. 

Not going back."}
{"text":"The mushroom soup and mac and cheese are great, as are the $1 oysters at the bar every Thursday! Service is consistently good whether in dining room or at the bar."}
{"text":"Went to this place many times since it's really close to where I live. 
- for the brunch, they are offering the free bread, but they never give to you until you ask. The portion of the food is tony. Over priced 
-for the oyster special, the oyster are small and not fresh. If you are only going there for oyster, you will also suffer the bad service . The manger was really rude 
-for their regulate menu, it's over priced. you can definitely getting better French cuisine with less money and better tasting. Even in the neighbour ( Yorkville ) 
-will never go again, only if it's free"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for brunch - I had this place bookmarked for so long so I was excited to try their Summerlicious menu.

When we got seated, the waitress informed us that they did not offer Summerlicious during brunch. When I made the reservation, it was through the Summerlicious website, so it was frustrating the staff had no idea.

Looking past that, they had a good selection on their regular brunch menu. I ordered their lobster eggs benedict ($21) and the boyfriend had the steak & eggs ($34). 

Food arrived fairly fast, and we were not impressed by the portion size. My lobster Benedict had a few pieces of lobster and instead of English muffin, you're given white toast. I've definitely had better and left with a full stomach. The steak was good but lacked flavor..

I get that we are paying a premium to eat on Bloor Street but this place is definitely over-rated with stingy portions. The manager that came to apologize for the Summerlicious confusion was also unprofessional and you can tell from his attitude that he wasn't sincere. Honestly, if this place is too snooty for Summerlicious, why offer it and treat customers with such a snobby attitude?"}
{"text":"Honestly one of my worst summer/winterlicous experience. At the highest pre-fix price point($53 for dinner) I really expected the food to be higher quality, delivering finer dining experience comparable to other places that doing the same priced prefix menus. 

The appetizer I got was the fish dish, the components were not well seasoned nor tasty at all. The main I got was the steak frites, which to be honest tasted like every-other-chain-restaurant food, looks and tastes like I got it at moxies, which isn't something I think the restaurant is going for. The dessert was the good part, I got the chocolate hazelnut one, it was delicious and by far the only part of the meal that delivered. 

I think in general my disappointment is with the price point of the prefix menu and the quality of food that came with it; when restaurants like Canoe and Auberge du Pommier are offering the same price for wayyy better quality food, maybe this restaurant shouldn't reach so far in the ranks and think they are on the same level. 

Beyond that, the service was border line ridiculous. Coat check was outside the restaurant, I doubt anyone was actually watching it or even making sure people are taking their own coats. I made specific requests that were  all denied, which is understandable I guess since it's so busy and they cannot accommodate.  My table was ready way after the time of my reservation. The waitress we had was pretty absent, almost every one of requests had to be delivered to her by someone else that happened to pass by the table cause we couldn't get a hold of her. I donno if this is cause we didn't order drinks, but that's just unprofessional. The food was slow as well. 

At the end of a dinner I paid $80 for per person with my friends, I felt like I could've gotten the same experience on regular price (not winter/summerlicious) at Moxie's and Milestone for half that."}
{"text":"I've written two previous reviews for this restaurant, both very positive, and I stand by them for the upstairs/inside restaurant and kitchen. Unfortunately, the high quality of food and service that I've come to expect from this place did not hold in the new patio area, which has a separate menu (and, I assume, kitchen). This review is only for the patio area and menu- I would still highly recommend the food served inside.

It's a shame, because the patio is beautiful, with lots of potential to be the setting for a great dining experience. I ordered the green tea mojito and lobster watermelon salad. The mojito, while tasting nothing of green tea, was very nice, if a little bit sweet for my taste. The salad was a disaster. The lobster was rubbery and tasted... a little off. It had me thinking, \"this probably won't poison me, but it tastes like it's been dead a little too long\". The nicely shredded cabbage was ruined by a dressing that tasted like lightly watered down mayonnaise. The slice of watermelon, which I was counting on for a fresh hit of fruit, was unfortunately soaked through with the water/mayonnaise horror, and so the salad was left without a single redeeming feature. Strange lobster and bland dressing does not a $24 salad make.

For dessert, I ordered a trio of sample portions: vanilla creme brulee, chocolate something or other, and a mixed berry compote trifle. The creme brulee was very good, the chocolate was fairly good, but the trifle had a strange, almost yeasty tang. I was finished with it after a single bite.

The hostess/waitress/bartender was friendly and pleasant, but seemed very inexperienced. She mixed up my mother's salad order and dessert order, and seemed somewhat bewildered throughout our lunch.

Overall, a disappointing experience at a usually excellent restaurant. I would suggest that you avoid the patio and stick to eating inside."}
{"text":"Tres bien! 

Before Nuit Blanche we went to La Societe for le diner.
I've passed by their beautiful patio so many times, I was excited to eat here!

I absolutely adore the decor here!  
Chic black and white, stripes and dots, patterned tile floors, dim lighting..  Once you step foot inside, you actually feel like you are in a French bistro.  Most people here are dressed to impress, ah oui, Yorkville.

If you have been to L'Express in Montreal, my dining experience at La Societe was a hell of a lot better.

The service here was great!  We were greeted and seated and 
our waiter was a Parisian-French cutie! =)
My friend busted out her French to order dinner, he was up to the challenge. 

He made great recommendations for wine with our meal.
They have an extensive list here with a lot of vintages (for a lot more dollars).

The fixed menu ($36) is popular here...
But we opted for a \"real\" steak and ordered the 12oz rib eye ($35).
It was perfectly cooked, greasy, salty, and tender.

As a side, of course, frites with garlic mayo ($6).  The fries were skinny and light tasting.  Really good!  

For dessert, the creme brule was formidable!  Topped with giant fresh berries, the custard was not eggy and not too sweet.  One of the better creme brules I've had!

I enjoyed my dinner, but next time I'll go for the fixed menu.
They had an option for mussels and profiteroles for dessert! 
The seafood station showcased all the seafood... so fresh!
(Points at lobster... I hope we see each other soon).

There aren't many restaurants on the shopping strip of Bloor in Yorkville.  I'm glad I can come here for tasty French food and fantastic service!"}
{"text":"Went here for Winterlicious. Staff were attentive and courteous. Chicken Coq au Vin was sooo good! Looking forward to returning for brunch. I've heard it's amazing!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for brunch, it was absolutely delicious. We both ordered the Smoked Salmon on Croissant.  The croissant was toasted just right and went really well with the smoked salmon and the fresh cream.  Even the baby greens that came with it had a very tasty dressing.  The portion was just right.   The service was great and the waiters were quite attentive.  I love the decor, you feel like you're in France.  They also had a really nice patio but unfortunately it was a little chilly today.  Will definitely come back to try the dinner menu next time!"}
{"text":"The setting was very nice and the atmosphere was very French.  The food was extremely AVERAGE and the service was VERY VERY VERY VERY BAD, our server wasn't good enough at her job to work at McDonalds.

She knew nothing about the menu, in fact one of my colleagues asked what came with an entree and her professional response was and I quote \"it says it's on the menu\"

Also she spilled one one and only full martini on my lap but at least she was sorry and that turned out to be the best thing she did all night....

If you want great French food and great knowledgeable service you should definitely go somewhere else...."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the Winterlicious price fixe menu ($35 dinner), and we had an amazing time. The Winterlicious price is a steal - I'm not sure we'd come here otherwise (except for a very special occasion), as the regular menu is quite expensive. 

The staff were friendly, attentive, and helpful. The food was absolutely amazing (best French Onion Soup I've ever had!) and the staff were highly accommodating of my gluten intolerance, even going so far as to put together a special dessert for me, as all the menu items contained gluten (including the mousse, which typically doesn't). We ended up ordering a bottle of wine, as most glasses were between $12 - $18, and a bottle of my favourite Gewürztraminer was $42, so it was better bang for our buck to go for the bottle."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, almost always for the $1 Oysters on Thursday, and would recommend it to anyone. I can't speak for the other nights of the week, but Thursdays in the lounge are busy from right after work until about 10 pm. This night seems to grow in popularity as it gets busier and busier every time I'm back. With this special it seems silly to go there and pay their regular price for oysters on any other night of the week."}
{"text":"The best thing about this restaurant is the mosaïque ceiling. It's very aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The rest is a resounding meh."}
{"text":"I like this place! It's a classy, fancy restaurant that's good for happy hour. I noticed a lot of business people come here so it definitely has an older, mature atmosphere. I recommend dressing at least semi-formal coming to this place. The service was great! The waitress checked up on us regularly. The food is definitely pricey but it's good. My friends ordered oysters and I got a medium-rare steak with french fries. We all ordered scotch as our drink. There are a bunch of TVs around the restaurant to watch sports and other miscellaneous things. You can either be seated near the bar or in the dining area.

In my opinion, this is a place I would go to for happy hour and have a couple drinks by myself or with co-workers. I also might take a date here for some fine wine and dining."}
{"text":"I have had the opportunity to eat here a few times, mostly for brunch.  I have had some disappointments and some highlights which I will list for you.

My lobster benedict was overcooked to the point of being rubbery, and your hollandaise sauce was overpowered by the amount of vinegar you used to poach your eggs.  The waiter that day was extremely pleasant though, he truly took care of my table as a true professional.

However, another notable experience was when we had a hornet/wasp that landed on my food while others were buzzing around our heads and we requested to be moved from the patio to the inside restaurant.  The waiter seemed disappointed that we were moving - understandably so since I will not get to tip her if I am going to be attended by someone else.  The host was the worst part.  If you have customers with insects flying into their food, I shouldn't have to ask you to be relocated.  This genius decides to ask me if everything was OK in a tone that said \"you must be the one causing this disturbance as no one else is having this problem\" and proceeds to take several minutes to find another table for us even though the restaurant had several empty spots.

Your food on good days is OK - not excellent.  You really are just an over-glorified bar and late dinner spot for Bay Streeters looking for a place to hang low before trudging back to their homes in Casa Loma and Forest Hill.

Disappointed, disengaged, and disinterested from coming here again.  You don't deserve your place on Bloor Street."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try La Societe, like forever...but just never got around to it. The patio never seemed to be that sunny (this is probably because I always go there later in the day) and I am hardly in TO during the winter.

So when it was time for my girls and I to go out, one suggested LS. We somehow all arrived at the same time (5pm) and both patios were quite empty. The lower patio is mainly for drinks (it has a small food menu) and it turns into a shisha bar at night. Therefore, we went to the upper patio (no sun) for proper grub.

Even though there were not a lot of people, our waitress was quite slow to bring us everything. I ended up ordering the Tuna Tartare (nice), but both my girlfriends ordered a summer Peach Salad which was the better choice. For mains, I ordered the Duck Confit which was a huge piece of meat combined with beans. Order this dish if you are feeling very, VERy, hungry. I think I liked my girlfriend's burger order better, especially the fries that came with the dish. There was this yummy garlic-y sauce and all of us finished the fries in no time.

Dessert was weird. I ordered this Rhubarb Mousse dish and it tasted like French's mustard. One of my other friend's said the same thing. Just to ensure we were both not crazy, we asked our waitress to try it out and she said it DID taste like mustard. She went back to the Pastry chef (who was \"very offended\" by our comment) and explained it was the compote (sour berries) that might explain the taste. In any event, if you like your dessert to taste like mustard (cheap French's at that, not even the nice French Dijon), order the Rhubarb mousse.

Took forever to get our bill. Wouldn't come back here again as there are so many other better patio places. Food is average, nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"First time at La Societe having just moved from Vancouver. Walking by on Bloor, the patio looked fun and vibrant, sat down to discovered to our delight it was 1$ oyster night. Order 6 oysters to start, and would you believe it, it too over an hour to arrive on our table!!!!! The waitress with blue hair was apologetic and went to the kitchen a few times to check on our food, but inexcusable wait times. On the plus, drinks were good, ambiance nice, and service was warm. Maybe will try on a slower night"}
{"text":"Unreal dining experience here.  Fantastic service, great setting.. couldn't ask for more!  This place is straight out of Paris with the bench style seating and atmosphere.  We came for the Thursday champagne/oysters deal and my 2 guests and I were blown away.  Steak was amazing, frites were godly, and probably the best creme brulee in town.  Will return for sure to try the brunch or perhaps another bottle of Veuve on the patio in the summer!"}
{"text":"As a valentine day dinner, we chose to treat our self with this fancy French restaurant, but this treat wasn't all that sweet. Firstly, this place is gorgeous! Starting with its stain glass iconic doors, upscale, and rich interior, they fit well with Gucci store across street. The service was impeccable; fun, kind, and quick. In fact they had called us to make sure we could find the place before hand! The ambiance was true to its Parisian roots, the waiters too spoke the dishes with true French accents. However, now for the downsides of this stellar establishment: the food. The menu is very limited and nothing jumps out. I had gotten the Cassoulet and my valentine got the Linguine. The beans of the Cassoulet were favorable but easily tiring. The pork and sausage were good, but nothing special. The duck was raw, but that's probably because I forgot to ask for well done. The Linguine was great at the start but later became too much due to the thick cream. The food was a serious let down. However this could have been due to poor choice on my part, also I wasn't able to the try the dessert. The pricing was quite high, but that's to be expected with such a location. I will definitely give this place another try."}
{"text":"Been back a few times for brunch! Now I love their brunch menu (so much my husband took me for breakfast before he proposed). I really liked the blueberry pancakes, the salmon with croissant and chive cream cheese and the lobster scramble eggs. Plus its such a lovely place to spend your Sunday mornings as its bright and the crowd is more low key."}
{"text":"I love this place and I've only been once. I joined a Meetup here this evening and we started with a glass of champagne in the bar area (champagne Tuesdays, where you get a glass of Veuve and hors d'oeuvre for $12). It's a good size bar and also have a seafood/oyster bar. We then moved in to the restaurant for dinner and I was equally as impressed. The food was excellent, as was the wine and the service. There's is also a patio area, and as the restaurant is above the shops it must be a great place for people watching. Unfortunately, due to the good weather the patio was full, but staying in the restaurant was not a chore as it's lovely, very grand and nice decor. It's not that pricey considering the area and it was definitely worth it. I'll be back to this place soon."}
{"text":"Ambience 5/5
I feel like I'm in France. Back in the 1920's where the famous writers and artists gathered in Parisian restaurants and cafes. The decoration is amazing! Love the booths  and macaroon bouquets. The lights. Very French like. 

The restaurant is located on the second floor, and has outdoor seating on the first and second floor as well. 

Food 4.5/5 
Escargot - the cream sauce and mushrooms are AMAZING. I love the flavor, the garlic bits!!  The only thing to lament was the escargots were shelled. 
Mussels and frites - very very fresh mussels from PEI. can't say I love the white wine sauce, it was kind of bland. But the flavor of mussels and freshness compensated for it. Frites were ok. Not bad not special. Small crispy things. 
Truffled Chicken - potatoes were cooked really well and very good herbed and spiced rub! Chicken was very well done, not too cooked and its very juicy! But it wasn't truffled :( no truffle taste...
Profiteroles with yuzu and peanut paste - very very well done!!!! Love the peanut paste. The yuzu balanced the sweetness of the desert. Great job!

Service 4/5
Servers were polite but didn't seem too approachable.. Reasonably fast service."}
{"text":"i was a bit nervous ordering my first STEAK TARTARE but at a french bistro like this, i might as well go big or go home! well-flavoured (mustard wasn't overpowering) and the mix-ins gave nice variation in texture. although as an entree i would have liked some toasty bread accompanying, it came with skinny FRITES which were done well.

unfort the menu online is outdated, listing two vegetarian options and a lamb loin entree, when there was only veggie pasta offered and no lamb. nibbled some of the DUCK CONFIT, which came with cabage, both excellently flavoured. didn't try the MUSSELS but it was generously portioned. the BURGER was cooked rare, and the RABBIT 

& while i don't like reading reviews focused on ambience & decor (food always takes precedent pre-eating), i will admit it was quite nice sitting under the stained glass and the back sections had a seriously cool vibe. the place got quite busy on a friday night but service was friendly & attentive. easily accomodates groups but as a result it definitely got loud.

i definitely wouldnt mind coming back for their $1 oysters nor the mussels + a pint of stella for $20 deal :)"}
{"text":"A friend recommended La Société to me, and if she hadn't I would have never know it was there. Entirely nondescript from the outside, yet the interior decor is amazing with it's stained glass, woodwork, and lavish decor.

The food was very good- we both had selections from the Prix Fixe menu and were completely happy with our choices, from starter to dessert.

The service was good, but just a tad slower than I would have liked. At one point my glass of water sat empty for a bit before anyone noticed and filled it up again. Otherwise, the staff was polite and friendly. 

I would happily recommend La Société to anyone looking for French ambience and cuisine in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner the other night and loved it. We sat on the heated patio which has a french cafe feel to it. We were able to bring our own bottle of wine and pay a $30 corkage fee. Our server was extremely friendly and accommodating. The food was absolutely fantastic

Steak Tar tare- 4.5/5
Fois Gras- 4.5/5
Atlantic Salmon- 4.5/5
Scallops- 5/5 melt in your mouth
white chocolate creme brule- 5/5

repeat- definitely"}
{"text":"In short, not worth the price.

The foi gras was subpar. The chicken supreme was overcooked and the gnocchi was bizarre (in a bad way). We also had the steak with mashed potatoes, the mushroom on sourdough, and the french onion soup  We were not impressed by any of the dishes.

The chocolate puff pastry as ok but the bottom layer was really stale."}
{"text":"I felt ripped off after eating here. Our entrees were $40+ and yet the meal was served with ketchup and what looked like plain old mayonnaise. For a french restaurant charging that much for an entree, I would have expected something more elegant and interesting than ketchup and mayo. Service was astonishingly inattentive and inaccurate as well, again for that price point. I get better service at Jack Astor's. I just think if you're going to charge high prices, the food and service should reflect that. The next night I went to Lee's Restaurant on King. Similar price point but the difference in experience was like night and day."}
{"text":"Booked 2 seats for my parents' birthday celebration. I came in the week before to prepay for the bill (gave them my credit card info) and to request for special birthday set up. They said they could do candles/writings on the dessert for birthdays.
On the day of, they did no candles and no birthday things whatsoever, and still charged me 20% tip on the total bill (including tip on the tax).

Would not recommend, and will definitely never be back again."}
{"text":"They first ran put of small spoons for my coffee. Theme they didn't have any ketchup, also ran out. Then the Omlette was served with potatoes and not the frise salad described on the menu. wtf is going on. Things are falling here..."}
{"text":"I had brunch here this past Sunday and it was alright. The decor is beautiful but they need to keep up with housekeeping. There were clumps of lint stuck between the cracks of the banquette seats.

The hostesses were unpretentious and although our server didn't check up on us as often as I'm used in this kind of establishment she did a good job being friendly. Until we got to the bills. The four of us paid separately with plastic and after the last bill was signed she picked up the card machine and walked away without a word. Maybe we were sitting around too long for her liking.

I ordered the beef short rib hash ($18). It was delicious! But for the price it was a \"That's it?!\" sized portion. They also offer a daily assortment of fresh-squeezed juices served in wine glasses...for $6.50. I ordered grapefruit juice which tasted like nothing special. My friend had fresh OJ that had been over-sweetened with sugar.

All in all not a terrible place, it's just pricey. I would go back, but probably not often."}
{"text":"The waitress poured water in my husband's glass of [pricey] whiskey. They need to change their water and whiskey glasses."}
{"text":"I don't quite understand the mid to low ratings! I went here for Summerlicious 2016 and it was so great. The location is good and the atmosphere, both inside and out, is wonderful and unique. The service was attentive. For food I tried the zucchini ricotta soup, the rainbow trout, the parisian gnocchi, the blueberry bread pudding, and the creme brûlée, and it was all absolutely delicious. I will definitely be visiting here again!"}
{"text":"We came here on my guests last night in TO before they flew back. They wanted to have a late lunch that would carry them till their flight at night. I suggested this place as I thought it would meet their discerning taste. 
The setup is in a word wow! I would go as far as saying that it would give any Parisian cafe a run for their money. It feels like one has been transported to Paris central. The funny thing is one of my friends got married in the exact same location a few years ago when this used be a Chinese restaurant. Amazing transformation as the place is unrecognizable. 
I was seated promptly and went through the menu while waiting for the guests to arrive. The menu is a replica of a french bistro crossing the t's and dotting the i's. 
I knew exactly what I was going to order to compare it with any good bistro. 
My friends arrived and after a bit of debate we settled on the following items:
Squash and french onion soups, pumpkin salad, hamburger and steaks and frites for moi (how else does one judge a french bistro) 
We also added a side of mushroom and brussel sprouts.
The wine list is extensive. Unfortunately we ordered a bottle of Rosehall Pinot Noir. Folks this is the single worse Pinot I have ever had. My buddy kept drinking it, I am guessing he was parched from the long walk as his wife and I kept debating whether we should send it back. Any self respecting bistro should not have this wine on their list and I mean I have tried vinegar that tastes better!
I ordered a glass of malbec and my buddy's wife ordered a shiraz to make up for this aberration.
First the soups, onion and butternut soups provided the welcome relief on a cold day. The mains didn't disappoint as well. My friends enjoyed their mains and especially liked the pumpkin salad and the sides. The Steak was as good as any bistro which is quite an achievement. Steak was thin cut and was cooked medium rare as per my liking. Fries were nice and crisp. 
The weekdays specials to entice people also caught my eye and I intend to try them out when I get a chance. 
Just a gorgeous space and an excellent excellent bistro. If it wasn't for the misstep in the wine I would rate it even higher. A solid 4 star.
P.S. I will come back here to enjoy their patio for sure."}
{"text":"This place is expensive. Your potential investment will probably result in sub-par food and management. 
We sat on the patio for brunch and ordered wine which arrived in filthy glasses. When the server changed out the glasses, the new ones arrived, still dirty. The people serving the food wore filthy aprons, a detail which made the cleanliness of the food questionable. Perhaps management might consider laundering aprons. 
The food arrived. In my case, a burger and fries. It was as though the kitchen forgot to season this impoverished burger and over compensated by charring the exterior attempting to mask an anemic, vaguely rotting taste. Needless to say The result was an assault to the palate. A terrible date that went sideways in the most confusing of ways. 
The musical choices choice- top 20  nineties hits Psuedo \"hard music\" that felt like more a staff statement rather than thoughtfully curated choices. On the other hand, the music was a perfect choice that for the jarring contrast between the lovely interior and terrible management and food. 
Here's the takeaway - at least for me.
1. Expensive 
2. Dirty
3. My food was gross

Don't go."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place was great! Very spacious but still intimate, just the right hint of lighting (even with the massive stained glass skylight!) and staffing was great. We were first greeted with a coat check, the girls who got them for us and handled our reservations were really nice, unlike a typical hostess. The bartender seemed really casual, down to earth - and eventually we were seated when the rest of our party arrived. We chatted for a long time so our server was super patient with us. The food came out in sections right on time and the food was great! Very good stuff! I'd recommend the charcuterie and creme brûlée, they were my FAVORITE things of the night. The drinks were kinda over flavored or too sweet and overpriced for my taste, but in general it was easily overlooked because of how good the service was. The place was really clean from what I could tell and didn't have any issues with rushes or anything like that. The kicker is the chef actually commented on my Instagram that he hoped I liked the meal! How cool is that?? Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a nice brunch here with a friend while in town. I opted for the lobster eggs Benedict, which featured perfectly cooked eggs with a generous portion of potatoes. The Paris-Brest that I ordered for dessert was fairly tasty as well, although otherwise unmemorable. 

Although the restaurant was fairly busy, our server was friendly, providing attentive and efficient service. I also rather liked the decor - while the restaurant is fairly modest from the outside, it has a beautiful interior, with stained glass ceilings and a pleasant Parisian bistro atmosphere."}
{"text":"\"Where is my microscope?\" Miniscule portions of everyday dishes keeps your calorie count low, which may explain the number of ladies lunching. Parisians would be surprised to find the quiche masquerading as a slice of pizza zapped from yesterday, plopped beside limp greens. The only consolation is paying in Canadian $. Non, merci."}
{"text":"Breaking this down in terms of what makes a good restaurant:

Does it have good service?
No.  Rude wait staff overall.  We went up to the front doors - says \"pull \"- tried desperately to get in, couldn't figure it out.  Turns out in the winter, you have to enter through the interior entrance.  They finally came to let us in, making us feel like shit about it -- but throughout our entire brunch, we could see countless people doing the same mistake -- why not JUST PUT A SIGN? \"Please use other entrance\" -- seems like a simple solution.

We had to send back some eggs because they were cold, and the woman just said, \"Ok,\" not \"I'm sorry\" or anything.  My friend had no pears in her pear salad, and asked why I did get pears, and the woman just said, \"Oh, it's fine -\" which is totally insane.

Does it have good food?
No.  As noted above, the food was inconsistent.  Some people got heaps and heaps of potatoes, some people got none.  I got three slices of pear, my friend got none.  The food was cold.  Mine was $18 for literally just eggs on a plate (the omelette) - no taste AT ALL and no sides.  One of the stars I am giving this restaurant is for the coffee, which was good. I would prefer to be asked cream or milk, and not just brought milk though.

I liked the ambience and I liked that they didn't add an automatic gratuity to our party of 7.  I won't be back ever again though."}
{"text":"People who complain about this place just don't have enough money to enjoy it.  Everyone wants everything for nothing.  Some girl below even complained about the quality of her welfarelicious meal...just save up and shut up."}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Bad service. Mediocre food.  Such a shame as brunch has always been great.  Wrong wine.  Wrong entree. Wrong bill. Should have gone to le select."}
{"text":"The location is very good . I had the steak frite, it was good . My 3 star rating is because of the service. A bit too slow for the busy restaurant and lunch time ."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place and finally did for winterlicous 2018. Hands down the worst restaurant I tried during the event.  The atmosphere inside and the interior is quite nice. The waitress was quite nice and attentive as she could be. It was quite busy.  The chairs were really small and it was hard to put a large winter coat on them. We didn't want to leave our jackets outside the restaurant on these coat racks they had. We were scared anyone could just walk by and steal our expensive jackets. 

Normally the point of winterlicous is to get people to come to your restaurant and present them with some of your best so them come back. This was hardly the case.  The pre-fix price of $53 for dinner was fair but if I came here normally and had to pay 100$ per person I can imagine i would be super super angry for what I got. 

The food came super slow but I get it was winterlicous. We had the winterlicous soup to start and it tasted bland and watered down. We also order the french onion soup. It was awful, was so sour and did not have enough cheese. A frozen french onion soup taste better. The steak for the main was so tough at med rare. The fries however were quite good actually. The other was chicken on mash potatoes. The chicken was cooked well and was juicy but the mash potatoes was watery like a soup. For desert we had creme brulee. We kinda had a bad feeling when the table next to us only took one bite. The custard tasted ok but the sugar on top was almost a 1/4inch thick.  

Definitely pass on this place and just get a street dog with poutine. Your wallet and taste buds will thank you. 

The only good thing was free parking for dinner really."}
{"text":"There are few things more tragic than a fall from grace.  La societe has been one of my favourite places to go.  From business lunches to milestone birthdays I've always enjoyed the atmosphere,  food, service and for sure,  the people watching.  All the more reason why this review pains me... but here goes.  My niece recently celebrated her 15th birthday.  As her gift, we went shopping on bloor street,  followed by lunch at societe.  No reservation,  so totally satisfied with an out of the way table.  But the service!  15 minutes elapsed before our waiter visited our table for the first time.  No bread on the table (unlike  every other diner), no greeting when he finally arrived. .. just a demand for our order.  Food came quickly and was excellent. .. not that anyone came by to ask,  refill coffee,  etc. All the more difficult when, 20 minutes after we finished eating we were still waiting to ask for the bill.  The clincher however,  was when we tracked someone down to make the request, we were subjected to a full eye - roll when our waiter made eye contact with the staff we located for our bill request. La Societe, i don't know what to say.  I will miss your food. But i was embarrassed in front of my niece.  You took a great afternoon of a young lady trying to be grown up and put a sour ending on it.  I'm still trying to figure out why."}
{"text":"I came across La Société searching for good steak tartare. The restaurant is very nice; they've done a great job of creating that French brasserie feel. We had steak tartare and foie gras as our appetizers. The foie gras was great. The size of the lump was nice, it was perfectly cooked and the accompanying flavours were just right. We both enjoyed the tartare which was well seasoned and had a raw quail egg.

Our main courses included short ribs and a cassoulet. The confit in the cassoulet was crisp and delicious, the pork belly and sausage both fine (hard to distinguish those much). The Cassoulet was lentil-based, not the traditional white bean. Still good, but not my favourite way to do cassoulet. The beef short ribs were fantastic. Very rich and filling. The reduction was thick and very flavourful.

We had a beet salad and fries as sides. Both were good. Dessert was the profitéroles. They were just OK -- I suppose if you really love profitéroles they may be better, but our waiter strongly recommended them.

Service was very good; no complaints there at all.

All in all, I would return. Just wish they had sweetbreads."}
{"text":"Fantastic location, beautiful atmosphere and delicious food. It is really interesting what they were able to do with a space that I've always associated with the Chinese restaurant that was the previous occupant. Dark wood, romantic, stained glass like lighting.  The duck confit was a bit drier than I would have liked it, but it had the right depth in flavour. Great, attentive service and a fantastic patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Came for the buck a shuck night... the oysters were fairly big but lacked quality. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I came with a group of friends for the 2015 winterlicoius lunch. 

We were really impressed by the decoration. It has classic candles at the table, big glass windows with sunshine, wood table and chairs and beautiful glass ceiling with art work. It was such a great place for a romantic date night/relaxing Sunday brunch. 
Staff is really friendly and funny, which made our lunch experience awesome. 

However, food is a little bit disappointing. 
Appetizer: Raw oyster is awesome, but the rabbit terrine is a bit dry. 
Main dish: Both chicken and salmon are dry. However the side dish was really tasteful. I love the mushroom and the vegetables and the potato.
Dessert: The warm chocolate cake is bitter, combing the sweet ice-cream, which makes it perfect. The lemon tart gets lots of compliments as well. Crème Brule is too sweet for me.  

Since it was a such lovely place, I think I will go back to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for dinner, but my favourite eating experience at La Societe was actually at brunch. Coffee and cream served nicely- my great, great aunt Florrie would approve. A tender croissant filled with smoked salmon and cream cheese. Creamy smooth eggs and chives. Mixed greens for good measure. C'est bon."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars for decor/location/overall feel.....very parisian, spacious, stained glass chandelier....

As for the food, I came here for brunch on Saturday... and I think I need to come back to try out their dinner menu to fully make up my mind. My French Toast however was fairly good, came with nutella and maple syrup. My capuccino was also really good so I ordered a latte after for an extra kick of caffeine. My friend had the tomato soup which was actually served cold kind of like a gazpacho and she was very pleased. 

The only annoying part of my experience was that the waitress came back every 5 minutes to see if we \"needed anything else.\" Once or twice is fine, but every 5 min was a little excessive, I wasn't sure whether she wanted us to order more...."}
{"text":"stopped by for happy hour for a dollar oysters, no minimum or maximum order. the service took a while for a slow thursday. the oysters were small but thats as expected for a dollar, and came with a side of cocktail sauce, horseradish and lemonsss."}
{"text":"Truly, the food was 3 stars out of 5, but the service brings my overall rating down to 1 star. We made a reservation here for a simple date night out, just my husband and I. We still waited 15-20 minutes for our table upon arrival; no big deal, enjoyed a drink at the bar. The ambiance was cozy and not too loud at all. We were finally seated, but no one even came to greet us for another 15-20 minutes! Usually, I'm not the type to care (as quiet time alone with my husband is hard to come by these days), but I was starving! Once our waiter bothered to acknowledge us, he quipped something rude like, \"what do you need?\" We completely felt as though we were a burden by just being there. Ugh!! Our first instinct was to get up and leave, but on a Saturday night at 8:30pm in Toronto, we knew our options were limited without another reservation. Sadly, the service didn't improve throughout the night. The food was okay; the beet salad was very tasty, but the portion was notably tiny for the price. I ordered the 6 oz filet with high hopes; however, it was dry and arrived cut in half. Who does that?! My husband enjoyed a bowl of their french onion soup along with basic steak frites. Definitely wouldn't return. Bummer, because we really liked the ambiance! Just goes to show how much service matters."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I went for summerlious. The appetizer was OK. We had the pate and oyster. For entree, we all got the steak frites. Fries were overly salted and the steak was a disappointment. We asked for two mediums and a rare the waiter brought us three mediums. So I had to sit there and wait for my steak while two of my friends were eating theirs. Not to mention one of the medium was too rare so we had to send that one back too. The dessert was no good either. The creme brulée was not smooth, the eggs were cooked during the process. 

Service was terrible. The waiters hardly did anything. No one came and ask if my food was okay. Terrible."}
{"text":"I am so sad to write this review.  Came here last week and had a less than stellar experience.  We did not have reservations, which was fine as they seated us quickly and the hostess was really polite and helpful.

Our meal started out fine, our soups were delicious and our mains were as well.  After completing our mains, here is where things got bad.  I had the prix fixe and was patiently waiting for our waiter to take my dessert order.  10 minutes went by.  15 minutes....he's around, serving the larger tables with the average age of 62.  20 minutes...I cannot get his attention for the life of me.  He hasn't looked our way.  We have been forgotten.

I get up and speak to the floor manager who noticed we had been abandoned.  Both he and another server came to our table, took the orders and offered us complimentary coffee, tea, anything really.  Our server said he didn't want to interrupt our conversation.  I don't really buy that but we still tipped him anyway. 

At the end they took all our beverages off our bill, which was nice.  Our crème brûlée was not uniform in temperature when it arrived.

It was nice they tried to fix things, but the damage has been done.  I live in the area and I felt really let down by the whole experience, especially in comparison to the first time I came and had a really nice dinner."}
{"text":"high end bar/restaurant somewhat hidden from lazy pedestrians. 
very nice decor and rich atmosphere. 
tuesday special - champagne for $12
coat check service and staff's attitude makes you feel very special and important.
definitely a place to visit if you're with french friends=)"}
{"text":"Food was good, but portions were a little small for the price paid. The seared foie gras was my favourite out of the three dishes that I ordered. I got the scallops because of the great reviews on Yelp, but it was just ok. The scallops were a little over cooked and the peas were a little chewy (is that how they are supposed to be? Maybe I don't know how they are supposed to be prepared, I don't eat peas that often. I'm used to having them steamed all the time but a little al dente). For dessert I had the sticky toffee pudding but it wasn't a bread pudding, it was a little cake. The granola on it was delicious. I had a bite of my friend's key lime pie which was tasty. My friend got the octopus which looked like a very small serving. If the portions were a little larger or the price a touch lower, I would give it a better rating. Food was good but nothing that totally blew me away."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, sophisticated interior and delicious food!
Great for afterwork drinks, dinner and weekend brunch!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Good service from moment we arrived til we left. Food was perfect (I'm a foodie) and given richness, the portions were generous. The value for $$$ was great. No idea what people were complaining about."}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks after dinner elsewhere. Great bar service and drinks.  Casual and laid back atmosphere. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm a little disappointed with the restaurant, the customer service and the food was especially disappointing.  When making reservations, they told me that because we are a large group we had to do a pre-fixed menu which consisted of a 3 course meal.  After doing research within all the downtown restaurants they were all asking for pre-fixed menus.  Fine, that's not a big deal, I just decided I'd reserve 3 tables of 6 to accommodate my group without having to go through the pre-fixed menu.  When making the reservations, I had to make it under 3 different people and I was only offered two time slots of 7:45PM and the next one at 8PM and there were no guarantees that the seats would be side-by-side.  Regardless I made the reservations and a couple of days prior to my dinner reservations, I get a call saying that they were just confirming my appointment (at that point I thought we were good to go).  The day of my dinner, I get a call in the afternoon saying that they were again, confirming my appointment for 7:45PM for 3 tables of 6, which was then confirmed that our tables would be side-by-side.  After an hour or two, I receive another call from the restaurant asking if it would be okay to put us in the private dining area where it would be a long table that seated everyone, and I confirmed that is okay.  I don't understand why a well-known restaurant like this would be so disorganized.  We get to the restaurant, it's nicely decorated with the most beautiful stained glass ceiling and booth seats in the middle of the restaurant and a separate bar area.  It wasn't packed at all for a Saturday evening, if anything the patio and outdoor seating was more busy than inside.  We were escorted by the manager of the restaurant and at that point he tells me that because we are such a large group our food order may not all be served at the same time.  Again, I didn't say anything and agreed that that would be okay.  We waited for about 30 minutes and ordered our meals.  I decided to go with their Duck Confit (Classic cassoulet, bacon lardon).  One of my friends decided to order the same thing and we were told there was only one order of the Duck Confit left and she was nice enough to let me have the last one since it was my birthday.  After waiting for about 15-20 minutes we got ONE bread basket for the whole table.  That was demolished within seconds and it took another 15-20 minutes to get another bread basket.  We waited and waited until finally our food arrived (all at once, surprisingly) and we all were starved at this point and ate all our food within minutes.  I on the other hand, could not even eat my Duck Confit because it was so salty that after each bit, I'd have to drink one glass of water.  I felt like I was eating spoonfuls of salt.  I think there were chickpeas or something underneath the duck and that was also spoonfuls of saltiness.  I had to get the boyfriend to finish off the plate and I ended up eating the fries from his burger that was left over, a couple of slivers of the Pan Seared Sea Scallops, a piece of the Steak Frites from another friend, and a piece of my other friend's SousVide Confit Pork Belly.  We had to ask several times for the waitress to bring us water and she would fill some cups and not others, and water was spilt on people several times.  I understand that as a large group, there is auto-gratuity included in the dinner but the least you can do is provide somewhat good customer service to bring people back.  I don't think anyone was pleased with the customer service nor were they completely satisfied with their food.  I felt bad for bringing my friends here to celebrate my birthday. I was thoroughly disappointed and I'm definitely not giving this place another go.."}
{"text":"I was a little nervous about visiting La Societe after reading some of the review here but my experience was nothing short of lovely. I neglected to take pictures, but I had the Chicken Supreme and a French 75 cocktail. The chicken with gnocchi was delicious - hot to the table and perfectly cooked. The cocktail was delicious - so refreshing, not too strong and not too sweet. The service was friendly, attentive and prompt. If I had one complaint, it was quite warm in the restaurant but that's nothing that can't be easily remedied. Bravo!"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch and OMG almost everyone who works here is stush as hell!!! I don't even know why because the food is over priced, considering that it's ok-tasting, the portions are tiny, the menu isn't very original, and the worst part: the wait was so long. 

Here are the positives: the resto itself is pretty. we had fries and they were salty but good. And it if weren't the bottomless mimosas for $35!!!....they were quite good. 

Here's The real: we made reservations for 3 ppl, and we were still made to wait over 30 mins for our seats. After finally being seated, and after ordering our drinks, it was probably a good 10-15 mins before our beverages got to us and we still had to flag our server. And no one was really apologetic about the wait -like, at all! In terms of food, the portions were small, which is disappointing considering the menu price. My friend ordered the short rib hash and the poached eggs that it came with were overcooked. And the bread under our salmon Benedicts was rubbery and so difficult to cut into! 

Overall not a very good experience. Which sucks, because you expect so much from a high end resto in Yorkville."}
{"text":"Visited La Societe last week for an event.  The restaurant itself is quite beautiful and ornate.  Reminds me of actually being in France.  The bar service was ok, if a bit slow given it wasn't too busy when we arrived.  It got really busy later in the night and the server neglected to bring water to the table despite being asked several times.  The house red and white wines tasted good and were on special which made the price reasonable at $7 per glass.  The fries with garlic aioli weren't a very generous portion and overall the menu seemed very overpriced.  The music was way too loud to have a comfortable conversation and the large number of people also contributed to the high noise levels.  I hear the patio is lovely in summer so might visit again, but just for drinks."}
{"text":"Went to La Societe for a late lunch after shopping. The location is interesting and if you're on the small (and crowded) patio, the view of the street allows you to easily people watch. The food was good, but not great. Omelette was a little under done. Chicken cobb salad was nice, but nothing special. The chef appears to be trying to create dishes that match the locale (it's in the trendy shopping area on Bloor), but not quite accomplishing it. And the prices feel like they are a little high for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Love the dining area in this place, it has an authentic Parisian feel to it. The menu, as one would expect, is traditional French bistro fare. The country pate and pan seared foie are proper. The steak frites are pretty average, while the duck confit is above average according to the member of my party who fired it down. Worth a trip back, this time for buck-a-shuck Thursdays!"}
{"text":"It's like you've walked into another world!  
They have completely transformed the old Chinese restaurant into a Parisian bistro with an exquisite stained glass ceiling. Unfortunately also with a Paris bistro is small tables. If you have more than 2 ppl grab a booth for sure. 

The food was excellent and I felt that my dollar did not go to waste. Good portions and well cooked food. I got the duck confit, $26. Although crispy and flavourful and a great pairing with fig and cabbage, It wasn't the most filling so order a side to share.  However if you intend to have dessert, you might be fine. 
I got frites for $6 to share and they were yummy. 

My mom loves foie gras and they have an excellent pan seared dish under the salads on the first page. She made it a main withy the best cream of mushroom soup ever. 

My mom in law had beef short ribs which looked soft and fall off the bone. He only had good things to say about it. 

For dessert, I am always a sucker for chocolate mousse $10. 
I was surprised when it came in a giant goblet and it was huge ! Something to share for sure or make sure you and your date leave room. 
The mousse sits on the bottom, with a layer off cookie then chocolate syrup then whipped cream. I could have done without the top layers. It was decadent and rich. 

The service could have been improved. Our server had a few tables spread around the room and he had trouble bringing us our menu or water in a timely manner. I also found the busboys awkward - they should be quick and almost invisible. 

Not pretentious at all and perfect for a date , friends or parents looking for something other than yorkville fare and a level up from the casual dining. There's not much else in the area."}
{"text":"I don't understand anyone who gives this place a bad review. I have been multiple times and love it. The service is great, the restaurant itself is beautiful. I always get the Beef Tenderloin and Brussel Sprouts. The steak is always cooked to perfection and the potato that comes with it is sooooooo good. 

I always get creme brulee for dessert when I am come here because it is so dang good one time while I was eating it I teared up - actual tears - because it was so delish (I have a soft spot for creme brulee). It is a very traditional creme brulee with real vanilla nothing extra or boujee added. Its so good I am drooling thinking about it. 

This place is great and yeah its a bit pricey, but you're in yorkville and I think its worth it."}
{"text":"The $1 oyster night on Thursday is so genius and delish. Great spot after work but gets a little busy. The wine menu is a nice addition to the oysters. I did find the service a little slow however, we did have a larger group and I can imagine the difficulty in managing everyone's order every single time they come around. 

The dinner menu looks tasty as well so definitely looking forward to returning to this little Yorkville gem."}
{"text":"My experience was terrible here! The only reason why I've even given stars is for decor, some dishes, and some friendly staff.
I came here with 5 other friends and was quite disappointed. First off, it started with our waitress coming back 10 minutes later to tell me that they were unable to make the drink I ordered because they had ran out of apple juice. I guess after seeing all the strollers parked outside should have raised a flag for me - kids love apple juice right? Next, when ordering, our waitress continued to tell us that they basically didn't have any of the appetizers available anymore except for their $5 basket of bread. Um, no thanks. Almost 10 minutes later after placing our orders, our waitress comes back to tell us that they ran out of smoked salmon. WHAT?! I guess smoked salmon bennys is a popular dish on their menu but after noticing that you can pay $7 for a side of smoked salmon you would think they would have stocked up? Okay, now we got our food. ALL of us had at pouched eggs in our meals....wait, no we didn't. Didn't you know that bennys have soft boiled eggs? Well i guess all the other breakfast/brunch joints are doing it wrong. SO disappointed that a breakfast joint that has so many pouched eggs on their menu couldn't even make a pouched egg!! I wish I could have taken pictures of it. I mean, some of us got lucky and got their soft boiled egg closer to the soft side versus hard boiled. And why was their hollandaise sauce sour??? NEXT, we had a dish that served toast on the side. When my friend was about to pick it up and eat it, I quickly stopped her and told her to look at the other side of her bread - BURN TO A CRISP. The sad part is that they tried to hide it by putting the bad side down. I can't believe it. So we politely asked our waitress if we could get another slice and showed her the competely black side of the toast. She looked at us and paused as if nothing was wrong. So we had to ask again and she said \"oh, you want another one?\" UM - I don't know many people who like to eat completely burnt black bread but maybe she does. She came back 5 minutes later with new toast - YAY! ....not. Still burnt on one side but she showed us the side that was perfect. At least this time we could rip off the burnt pieces. 
Overall, our entire table was quite disappointed in coming here but we remained polite and didn't say anything (other than the toast) to any of the staff and saved it all for this review. We will never come back and know that there are a ton other delicious restaurants for us to devour. :)"}
{"text":"I won't comment at length about how beautiful the inside of this place is because so many others already have, suffice it to say you need to go here to appreciate it because the pictures don't do it justice. 

On a Friday night at 8:00 the service was on the ball and friendly. My water glass never got empty and I really appreciate that. When I was looking for some half-bottles on the wine list the server pointed me in the right direction and then moments later the bar tender came by to tell me of a few things he had off-list. This type of service is appreciated and as others have remarked, rare in a Yorkville hot-spot. Kudos to whoever trained the staff. I can think of a few restaurants in the neighbourhood who should contract your services.

Still getting over the demise of Bistro 990 we ventured out to find a replacement. Unfortunately, the tartare couldn't touch Bistro 990's with a 10 foot pole. It was too fatty and bland, but it was better than others I've had. The mushroom soup puree was excellent. I went with the $36 prix-fixe which included soup, bavette steak in peppercorn sauce and creme brûlée for desert. The steak was done perfectly and extra tender. The brûlée left something to be desired, it was too sweet and the white chocolate shavings on top only added to an overly sweet taste.

Overall I like this place and I will probably come back. They have a great selection of lunch/brunch items I'd like to try on the patio in the summer time. However, in terms of a replacement for Bistro 990, I can't say the search for our new french bistro is over. I get the distinct impression that I'd need to come here twice a week and spend $500 at the bar to ever be recognized. It lacks that homey feel you get with a professional maitre'd who offers to take your coat and remembers your name after a few visits and in a few months knows your regular order. But I don't think I can expect that here. Any place with this much money sunk into the decor must have expensive corporate backers and they are obviously relying on the big spenders and expense accounts to pay the rent, not humble restaurant goers."}
{"text":"When I'm wanting a slower pace after a hectic day of shopping along Bloor Street, this is my go to sanctuary. The food is superb and their service ranks fairly high up in my books. 

Their menu is definitely sophisticated if you're accustom to fast food. Well worth the experience of you don't plan on leaving the continent. 

However, I suspect during Summerlicious and the winter version if they participate may have a slight quality dip due to higher than expected volume of diners. Personally, I avoid any restaurants when they cater to such promotions and would prefer to visit when the masses aren't involved. Unfortunately my gastronomical experience was negatively impacted last night due to Summerlicious 2016 (I believe. The restaurant may differ with my opinion.) as I was not aware of their participation."}
{"text":"The restaurant was beautiful, but we were surprised it was no where near full for a Friday night.  Even though it wasn't full, the service was a bit absent at times. Our server got bread to our table about 30 seconds before out soup got there. The food was so so. We enjoyed our cocktails, but the mussels, and French onion soup were not winning us over with their flavour.  Will not be going back for dinner, but maybe for cocktails."}
{"text":"La So-so-ciete.

La Societe feels like a French restaurant run by non-French owners trying to imitate a French restaurant from a 'How to run a French restaurant' manual.  The elements are there (decor, menu classics, menu layout etc.), but there's just no French passion in the execution.

At first, staff and management were very accommodating to change our table and make sure we were comfortable, so that was appreciated and made a good first impression.  However,  from there the evening stagnated.  It wasn't awful, but it was lacklustre.  Some dishes were good (the burger), some were atrocious value ($48 for maybe 3 oz of lamb? Mon dieu!), some were just not good (a forgettable lemon tart with a days-old, mushy crust, and a sinewy, saw-worthy flatiron steak).  Plus I waited far too long between offers to refill my Manhattan- my $18 manhattan!  So while not a complete and utter fail, the evening should have been far better than it was.  There are better French bistros in the city."}
{"text":"Had such an excellent experience here for my birthday dinner, and truly felt like I was in a little French bistro in Paris! The french music, lighting, decoration, tables/booths, all reminded me of a Parisian restaurant. The food was also impeccable! We started off with some glasses of bourdeux and rosé, and we did the prefix menu, my boyfriend and I both had the oysters, then for our mains we had the chicken and salmon, and the side of frites, which you HAVE to have! For dessert we had the chocolate cake, and the creme brule. The creme brûlée was FANTASTIC! Was worried about the service before coming since I had read some reviews that the service wasn't the best, but luckily the service was excellent and had a great experience. Loved this restaurant, and would definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a late breakfast on Saturday morning and ordered coffee, and a Mamosa. 

We ordered waffles with fruit and lobster eggs Benny. The staff was very nice very pleasant and very efficient our meal came out extremely quickly.  

Debra had ordered the waffles and it looked to me like it was just a regular waffle out of a toaster, (not an ice crafted fluffy waffle), with some raspberries popped on top it didn't look anything special - very underwhelming....I don't think it was very good  because she didn't eat much of it.  And the Lobster Eggs Benny (which I had high expectations for), had some nice pieces of lobster but I didn't like the potatoes that were covered in some kind of a sticky sauce I don't know what it was but it wasn't very unpleasant and these soft poached eggs sat on top of the potatoes in a very kind of an awkward looking dish. The hollandaise sauce was nice on the eggs and the were poached perfectly but the potatoes were a bit of a mess ! 

I've been here many times and had many things on the menu and I think this is probably the most disappointing meal to date."}
{"text":"In the heart of Yorkville, La Societe has the charm of a Parisian bistro and a lively atmosphere that hints of New York's Balthazar.  

We've heard a few of their seafood dishes didn't measure up, and that may be true but the Dover Sole was tender and delicious, as was the Steak Frites according to my hubby.

What could be improved on in my opinion is the Hosting staff. Who should be the customer experience ambassadors at any fine food establishment, La Societe's seemed unwelcoming and uninterested."}
{"text":"The oysters were gritty. The place was empty. Very little vibe.  The service was inconsistent. Some were very pleasant."}
{"text":"1.5 stars 

Had the chance to check this place out on a Sunday for a birthday brunch with a group of 10. 

Service was great. Our waitress showed no signs of impatience despite a few people showing up late (almost 20 minutes after the reserved time). She was really attentive and accommodating. She really did take that extra step which I will explain in a bit.

The food, however, was a write-off. 

I ordered the Salmon Eggs Benedict ($16) and couldn't help but notice how stingy the portions were. Two eggs situated on salmon and HALF a piece of toast (which I swear is Wonderbread) with potatoes on the side. The eggs were completely overcooked! The yolk was firm and no longer runny...can't consider that to be poached eggs anymore. My friend also ordered the same thing and only one egg was poached correctly with the other overcooked as well. How do you mess up on eggs during brunch? This is not to mention the salmon and hollandaise sauce was way too salty. Terrible. 

I did voice my concern about the eggs to our waitress to which she quickly took back to the kitchen and served me new ones. I also really appreciated that she brought out an EXTRA egg for my friend as she had overheard our discussion that one was overcooked. Hence, the full star for service. At the end of the day, the dish served at its best is still subpar and an utter disappointment. 

A few of us got the Pancakes ($15) to share because it sounded delicious and somehow, this was more terrible than my eggs benedict. Didn't look appetizing at all. The pancakes were large and SO thick, which wouldn't have been an issue but it was really dry and tough. The batter tasted like it came from a pre-packaged pancake mix (i.e.: Betty Crocker) and they were actually crispy..border-line deep fried...?!. Pretty much tasted like everything a pancake should NOT be.  

Another thing I wanted to mention (although I did not try) was the Hamburger ($19). My friend had requested for medium upon ordering but the burger came out extremely rare. The meat was bright pink, possibly the rarest burger I've ever seen. Smh. 

The additional half-star was for the nice, classy ambiance but that is to be expected for a restaurant located in Yorkville. 

Overall, the food was memorably bad and I will not return nor would I recommend this to anyone. At least not for brunch."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I went there for his birthday dinner at La Societe and left completely satisfied in all areas of décor, atmosphere, food and service. The décor of this place reminded me of a fancy diner. The atmosphere was upbeat, pretty busy on a Tuesday night and patrons consisted of suits and more suits.  My boyfriend had the sautéed escargot with oyster mushroom, 12oz new york strip loin, side fries, and toffee pudding for dessert. I had the prix-fixe and started with the mushroom soup, followed by the slow cooked flat-iron steak, side truffle mac and cheese and finished with a white chocolate crème brulee.  

sautéed escargot with oyster mushroom - 4.5/5
12oz new york striploin - 5/5 \"best steak in life\" he quotes
fries - 3/5
toffee pudding with ice cream - 3/5 (nota bene's version can't be beat so far)
mushroom soup - 4.5/5
slow cooked flat-iron steak 3.5/5
truffle mac and cheese - 3.5/5 (first time having truffle, don't think I am a fan)
white chocolate crème brulee 4/5

The food was pretty delicious but the one thing I must rave about is the impeccable service. Christophe was our server and he was very knowledgeable, polite, attentive, patient, and everything else you can ask for in a pleasant dining experience. He was very patient as we took a while to decide what to order as we were not hungry at the time, bread basket was never empty, glasses were always filled, and regular check ups were appreciated. All in all, it is very rare that we try a new restaurant and everything is up to par but La Societe had met and exceeded our expectations. I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I decided to do my birthday brunch at this place. I chose la societe because of my past experience and the consistency of the food and service.

I was told for a group larger than 8 you need a set menu, so I chose the 35$ per person (I know, steep). I have to say I left very disappointed with the food and the service. The food was subpar, not presented as described in the set menu (potatoes missing with quiche, no scones, etc), potatoes were served cold to the extent we ordered French fries, quiche was soggy, the pastries were not fresh. The only good thing served was the salad, and the portions were not enough for 13 people.

The service was very poor. More often than not we were left for extended periods of time with no coffee and water and had to chase the Waitresses. On top of that, we went for a fixed menu and the server came asking if people wanted dessert and that was not planned and felt like a money grab. She didn't even know that I had left my CC information and my guests were fighting over who pays at the end.

The bill was $725, For the price I paid, this was a terrible terrible experience!!! Very disappointed. To add insult to injury, I complained and all I got we will look into it, and promise to make it better next time. Ya right, as if I am going to give any more business to them with rectifying what happened."}
{"text":"I found Paris in Toronto! Great food! Impressive champagne menu! Sexy ambiance! Friendly (knowledgeable) staff. Thursday night are the best!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch with a few friends. The restaurant was completely empty (at 3pm)
From 3-5pm, we were told that the only menu we could order from was the Bartop menu. It was a very limited menu with only a few choices to choose from for the main meal.
We all shared the pomme frites which were very tasty and crispy.
As for the main meal, I ordered the cobb salad. I enjoyed this meal as it was very light and not too heavy. My only criticism was that the grilled chicken was very bland.

Personally, I'm not sure if I would return for lunch. However, I have been here for brunch on the weekends and it was much better."}
{"text":"This is my second time I've been to this restaurant and I have been let down tremendously. My husband and I had a reservation for 6:30 to start off our evening. My reasoning for my rating is as follows:

Service: Exellent. Probably the second best thing this evening. Host was presentable, waitress was nice and friendly, servers and bus boys were very well mannered. Although: I asked for ice water twice, was not given.

Food: Despite leaving this restaurant the first time at a very high note, the food was a huge let down. We had ordered the following: oysters, tuna tartar, trout & gnocchi. 
Oysters - VERY over priced. They were $48 for a dozen ($4 each). These oysters were not worth the price. Rodneys Oyster Bars best oysters cost $4 each and these did not compare to that quality of oyster. A fair price would of been $2 each. Mind you, I eat oysters very often. 
Tuna Tartar - Probably thee only thing we enjoyed. Highly recommended ordering this. 
Trout - Was VERY salty. (And I'm the type to usually ADD salt to my food.) The fish was cooked beautifully with a gorgeous & even sear on the skin. The kale, mushrooms, bacon, & whatever light sauce they added under the fish - did not give the dish any justice. 
Gnocchi - My husband loves gnocchi. His mouth watered at the site of gnocchi on the menu. Sad to say he was beyond past disappointed. We understand the texture of the pasta was very, slimy. It wasn't the rich, smooth potatoe with a nice pasta as a coat. It literally just felt like really THICK ball of flour. It was bland. 

Cost: I don't mind paying a lot for high end restaurants. But it has to play justice for everything. With what we had tonight VS the cost, it wasn't a bang for out buck (s). Our bill came to $190(something) because we also ordered a half liter of wine which was $55. 

Needless to say, we probably won't come back."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and to be honest, it wasn't as good as I expected. The food is average. The interior is beautiful & that was the highlight of my experience here. I had the butter milk pancakes."}
{"text":"This restaurants decor just makes my dining experience better, it's so beautiful and dare I say, French-esque. 

Its got an incredibly friendly, attentive, knowledgable staff along with some hotties ;)

We both ordered a glass of white wine( our waiter recommended it to go well with our seafood dishes. I wish I knew or remembered the name) 

Lunch Menu:

Pan Seared Sea Scallops -$32
Pea? puree, pea and pancetta regout, crispy pancetta 

Pan Seared Irish Organic Salmon -$26
Roasted chesnut and cauliflower, spinach, cauliflower puree, trout roe

The portions were so tasty!! We got stuffed and couldn't finish it despite the amazing flavours. No room for any dessert either :( I really wanted to try the Grand Marnier Creme Brûlée!"}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious lunch. Not the greatest but I guess you can't expect that much from Winterlicious. But the side we ordered that were on the original menu were Bomb as expected from my previous visit. The service is great and love the tinted window ceiling!"}
{"text":"The service and food at La Société has been excellent, highly recommend their weekend Brunch! This restaurant has a very gorgeous ambiance to it and overall decor. 

The food has been delicious each of the six times I have been there and the servers are incredible hospitable. My only critique would be that it can be on the pricey side so check out the menu before visiting!"}
{"text":"Had drinks and a salad during the mid afternoon. Sat on the outside patio and watched Bloor St walkers pass by, while my favourite stores are across the street. The service was great. The hostess was nice enough to ask the kitchen to make me a salad, even though they hadn't started serving their dinner menu.  I would come back the next time I'm on Bloor."}
{"text":"We were at La Société this past Saturday for brunch. Things started off well as our reserved table was ready and was nicely located. We had a good view of the main room, which is sadly, the only reason to visit, I found. It took about 10 minutes for our waiter to appear, but that was fine, as we were 3 friends catching up on each other's news. A waiter did appear finally, and orders placed. Two of our group ordered the mushroom and cheese omelette, which was described as being accompanied by a pear and frisee salad. However, when the dish arrived, the \"salad\" was nothing more than a garnish of a few slivers of pear so small it was impossible to determine the variety, and a few sprigs of the baby endive on top of the omelette (it did look pretty!) The smallish omelette contained about 4 slices of mushroom with a bit of cheese. Otherwise it was nicely cooked, although very bland. Half of the plate was covered with potatoes too salty to eat. The waiter eventually reappeared for coffee but didn't ask how our meals were, and it was ages before he reappeared to refill coffee cups. I never did get more water to rehydrate myself after trying 2 or 3 of the potato bits. I certainly don't mind paying the prices asked for good food and good service, but La Société provides neither. It instead seems to be a place where you can be seen, and to say that you've been!"}
{"text":"I finally made it here after weeks of pining and was disappointed.
My experience did not get off to a great start as the hostess wanted nothing to do with our party of 8 and kept insisting we sit upstairs despite us telling her numerous times we made a reservation for the lower patio (which I should note you must speak to a manager to get a reservation for more than 7 which sounds a lot easier than it actually is - boo urns). After much back and forth we were finally seated on the nearly empty patio and left there for what felt like eternity before we were asked for our drink order.  Needless to say service was so so, and despite the lack of other patrons we had to constantly flag down a server to put in our orders. I will say that halfway through our meal we did get a new waiter (thank you shift change!) who was very attentive and charming, which is why I have rated La Societe at three stars and not two.  Food was decent but by no means mind blowing, the steak frites and terrine were underwhelming but the Croque Monsieur and pate were de-lish. Another quick side note, if you plan on sitting on the large patio downstairs be warned that the menu is different and quite significantly smaller and no, you cannot order off the larger more appealing upstairs menu no matter how much you try and bribe your server.  As for the upstairs, the restaurant itself if beautiful and very Parisian in feel, but also very dark and not really the best place to be on a gorgeous Summer day.  And the seafood set up near the restrooms?!?!  Maybe it's just me, but I was slightly put off.  Would I go again? Maybe for brunch w/ the girls or a lunch w/ clients (if they insisted) but  I did cancel my upcoming dinner this week in favour of somewhere with more personality and flexibility if that tells you anything."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a couple of friends while I was visiting Toronto and had an awful experience. I really expected more!

We sat on the patio in the evening, for Summerlicious, and it was a joke. My oysters were not shucked properly, they were still attached to the shells and had splintered shell and sand inside them. The steak frites was tiny...I'm from Alberta so maybe I am spoiled for steak, but seriously it was the size of a golf ball and ice cold. Dessert was okay, I had the creme brulee and it was average. 

The worst part was the service. Our waitress was inattentive and rude. My friends ordered the gazpacho and sat with it for 10 minutes before we were able to flag down another server to bring us spoons. I ordered 'house wine' from her and she charged me for premium ($22 a glass). She was nowhere to be seen for almost the entire meal, except when she came over to tell us a story about her friend from Newfoundland while we sat there politely trying to finish the conversation we had been having. 

Overpriced for what it was, and again the service was APPALLING."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amongst my favourite French restaurant in Toronto. The service and food in always great. The steak and duck confit is unbelievable. They also have a very good selection of wine and are great at making wine peering suggestions. I've also gone for amazing brunch on the weekends where they have typical French pastries and croisants that are worth every penny.  You can get free parking validation for dinner not for brunch."}
{"text":"Having been here a few times (lunch, drinks on their patio, and full blown wining and dining with a group of friends), I think it's time for me to write my review.

Service has always been excellent.  Every single time, I've had a server who was friendly, helpful and just plain knew their stuff.  Everything from helping with wine selections and menu recommendations to special requests dealing with dietary restrictions.  I never felt as though any request was too much.

The décor is stunning.  When I think of how the place looked during it's prior incarnation as a dim sum restaurant, the transformation is phenomenal.  Beautiful mosaic tile floors, leather banquets, brass rails, dark woods and bright windows...just amazing.  It's always amazing to be in a restaurant where the décor matches the beauty of the menu.

Now the menu...wow!  Foie gras, charcurterie, escargots, tuna tartare, marinated olives...all delicious and exactly what you'd expect for a French restaurant of this calibre.  The superstar of the appetizers for me has always been the escargots...so deliciously prepared and flavourful...the foie gras is certainly delicious and probably the best I've ever had in Toronto, but the escargot still has it beat in my opinion.

I've had their steak frites and the almond crusted halibut with stewed vegetables.  The steak frites was amazing and cooked to perfection.  The crusted halibut was delicious, but the stewed vegetables stole the show.  My friends had the lamb shank, and the roasted chicken, both, they claim were absolutely amazeballs!

The desserts were just ridiculously rich and delicious (as you'd expect in a French restaurant).  I had the deep fried strips of chocolate bread pudding topped with chocolate sauce and ice cream AND served with 2 dipping sauces!!  Are you kidding me?!  Crazy good!  My table mates had...pfft, I can't remember, I was too absorbed with my dessert, but they said it was good, whatever it was they ate.

Prices are high, yes, but the food is second to none.  I have been here a few times, and I dare say I will return - again and again."}
{"text":"3.5/5
Can perhaps steal away here for a bit of Parisian atmosphere. I always like a place that seats comfortably while good food is enjoyed.

Ordered their classic La Societé club sandwich for lunch. It came with hot crispy skinny fries and a garlic mayo dip recommended by our server. Chicken in the sandwich was juicy and the lettuce was fresh and velvety! Flavour was good. What can I say, I picked a healthier option. =] But my friend's scallops were really fresh & delish according to her.

Wells, a good lunch experience overall! Definitely won't get tired of looking at its beautiful stained glass ceiling for a long time."}
{"text":"I work across the street from here, and came in recently for lunch.  I had the croque madamme and it was really, really good.  Very decadent and large in size.  The fries were very good, exactly what I want from a french bistro.

The service was attentive and pleasant.  I will return."}
{"text":"Totally re-done space where I used to get my dim sum fix downtown if I didn't want to trek North.

The infamous stained glass is impressive. A very cozy french bistro , almost as coziness as Balthazar new York but close second.

The food fare was above average, quality steak frites and decent portions."}
{"text":"They were under construction and a bit hard to find. The decor was beautiful. Our main server, she was amazing !!! Very attentive and was very professional. We were served bread and I normally love dipping it with balsamic vinegar and olive oil, so I had ask an alternative waiter that was not occupied with anything. I was ignored my this flamboyant waiter as he passed our table, it was non peak service. I had to be a bit assertive as he looked at me and walked away again. There were only less than 10 tables around 3pm. He finally managed to come over and was really rude. Despite this flamboyant server who had no passion, or professionalism for his job, I did live our female server. Something recommended to order is the Tuna tartare as it is very fresh and light. For those sangria lovers- order the apple sangria ! It was the perfect balance of the apple and Riesling wine."}
{"text":"fine food, but I can't remember what I had. nothing overwhelmingly good."}
{"text":"I dined at the restaurant for the winterlicious event.
I expected better for the price point. 
Quantity wise for food, things were fine, 
but quality wise, I would have been better off dining at milestones/ the keg or some other high end chain.
it is also a very busy place, with lots of ambient noise. The waiter was very busy, water was not refilled often even when the glass was bottomed out, waited for at least 10 min before a menu was served to us.

The looks of the food don't match the price point. The way the food was presented matched mid end chain restaurants like Kelseys.

I had Tartar for appetizer, steak and frites for main, and lemon tart for dessert.

The tartar was the only thing I was satisfied with the dinner quality wise, but presentation wise, it could have done better.

The steak frites, the steak was very rough for medium rare steak. The fries were cut into short pieces which were difficult to eat.

The lemon tart was overly sweet and the crust was very hard and my partners creme brulee was also overly sweet.

overall, very disappointed, this would have been fine for something costing around 40 per head, even at that price, there are better options than this."}
{"text":"I went here with my husband and another couple as the start to our double date night. I reserved a table on the Wednesday before and I'm glad I did, but even still we were originally seats in a less than ideal table. I spoke to the hostess and a manager came out and graciously moved us, which was very nice of them, because apparently many people call and reserve specific seats! 

I have walked by this restaurant a million times and never known it was there. It is directly on Bloor, but in a small \"mall\" which houses The Japanese Foundation and some other businesses. The restaurant is on the second floor and there are no readily visible signs on the street, so you would never think to just walk into this place...maybe that's the point! 

The decor of the restaurant is really lovely. They have a huge, stain glass ceiling and dark wooden furniture and Art Nouveau decor. The bathrooms are large, individually sectioned off stall, with white and black tiles everywhere and large, vintage, French ads on the walls. 

Two of our party ordered from the Winterlicious menu, one ordered from the regular menu and I ordered from their regular Prix Fixe menu, which they have available all the time and is $7 more than the Winterlicious. 

They were also offering some Winterlicious cocktails...I had three (the same one) and they were excellent. 

Our appetizers included two salads, which looked great and (according to the orderes) were. My husband ordered the onion soup from the Winterlicious menu and it was great and I ordered the mushroom soup from the prix fixe and it was excellent!

The main courses included steak from the regular menu, which were ordered with steak frites. The steak was a nice cut of meat, prepared exactly as asked and the steak frites were served with a garlic aioli (which we all tried) and was really good!

The lasagna and pork belly were ordered from the Winterlicious menu. Lasagna came in a rounded dish, where it had been baked and was on the smaller side, but satisfying within a three course meal. My husband had the pork belly from the Winterlicious menu and I tried that. The sauce on it and the tenderness of the pork were really nice. 

I had the pistachio chicken, which was a huge dish! The chicken breast was served on top of another cut of chicken, but in dark meat. Both had pistachios on top and delicious sauces drizzled along the bottom of the plate and a few apple slices as garnish. I couldn't finish two pieces of chicken and I stuck mostly with the white meat, but it was a nice option to have to two and I tried the dark and it was really excellent as well! 

The reason I chose the prix fixe menu over the Winterlicious, was because of the dessert. The Winterlicious had the pistachio chicken as a main and the onion soup was an option for the appetizer, but the desserts set the prix fixe apart. On the Winterlicious menu the option was a rhubarb crumble, or chocolate mousse. Neither of which I really cared for, although I tried it from my husband and it was good. On the prix fixe menu you have a choice of creme brule (which I have heard good things about) and a sticky toffee cake. I asked the waitress what she recommended and she said the sticky toffee, because it was such a lovely, winter dessert. I had been set on the creme brule, but you know what....brules are a dime a dozen. How many places have sticky, toffee cake? 

I was NOT disappointed. The cake was amazing! It was a small, singular bundt cake, topped with a toffee crisp and a small scoop of caramel ice cream and surrounded on the plate with warm, caramel. It was decadent and delicious. 

Finally I'll mention that our server was lovely and attentive and not a single person in our party were disappointed in any way. We all left very happy and satisfied. 

This place is a little on the pricier end (would have been less so except for the three drinks myself and my friend had and the beers that the guys had), but it's great for a nice night out, or a romantic date. 

I will definitely come back some time in the future."}
{"text":"We made a reservation here for brunch since it happened to be the closest brunch place to our hotel and it was great! Easy to find with good service and a nice selection to choose from on the menu. Almost too good because everything sounded so yummy it was hard to decide... for me it's always a toss up between savoury or sweet but thankfully my brunchmates were up for sharing!

I ordered the short rib hash and it was incredibly tender and the portion was surprisingly very large with lots of short rib. We also tried the in-house made scones (I'm not a huge scone fan but they seemed pretty good), salmon benny, caramelized fruit french toast (this was the dish I would've ordered for myself if I went the sweet route and it was delicious!), the traditional breakfast (looked the most 'normal' to me, but my friend liked it), teas, fresh squeezed juices... all were really good. Of course the short rib and the French toast were standouts for me and you can never go too wrong with brunch! 

The restaurant itself is really nice and upstairs from the big name brand stores, there is a patio but it was incredibly windy and still cold so it wasn't open which was fine by us. They have nice booth seating inside which is comfortable. When we got there the restaurant had just opened at 11am and we had the first reservation so it wasn't busy but definitely by the time we left it was all full. Service was nice and I liked the French bistro feel to the place. Really liked how they take reservations especially for brunch! Unheard of in Vancouver!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

This has become my go to for grabbing a glass of wine and a bowl of soup after shopping on Bloor...love the space, especially in the winter...has a very cozy feel and the bar always seems to have a few folks sneaking an afternoon rendez vue.  In the summer I frequented the street level patio a few times - blah!  Great people watching, spotty service and rediculous bar menu cooked on a BBQ...wouldn't recommend it unless you have single friends that are looking for the scene and you are being a good wing person.

The french onion soup is good, but venture from the classics and you will find other gems...and service in friendly and slightly formal.

I am glad to see an owner (INK, same as Ultra) who takes soo much pride in the creation of the space...really amazing details and workmanship...like a piece of Paris in Toronto.

I will be back many times, as this spot is now on par with Le Select as one of my favourite French Bistro's in Toronto - give it a try!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, I was expecting better for the price. We ordered the Lobster 
Benedict, the omelette and the salad with the big eye tuna. I think the salad was the best of all of the dishes. We had reservations but still had to wait for our table, and the host completely ignored us for at least 5 mins. It was kind of embarrassing. 

The worst part was that there was a spider in the side salad that came with the omelette, alive and moving under the lettuce. It was disgusting but the server acted like it was no big deal. He brought a replacement salad but it was just lettuce drenched in vinaigrette, with no garnishes or anything.

I was really hoping to like this place...the bathrooms were nice though. And I enjoyed my prosecco."}
{"text":"Good food, deco. I give it a generous 3 stars for subpar service. From the somber attitude of the hostess to the uptight manager...so bad. Im starting to think that TORONTO as a whole lacks in good customer service which comes from lack of integrity in their work and a delusional sense of entitlement. In comparison to the states and cities like NYC or San Fran, Toronto Cust. service is sub-par n second rate. What makes it excellent is the creative chefs and mixologist...but as for the people.... they truly need an attitude adjustment!!"}
{"text":"My first visit to this bistro-style restaurant was back in June, we were so pleased with the experience, La Societe has become our go-to place for a guaranteed crowd pleaser! I have only been for brunch over about 5 visits, this is what I have tried:
Banana & chocolate stuffed French toast: one word: amazing. (if you don't like sweets do NOT order this!)
Lobster eggs Benedict: available seasonally (summer) - all who have tried have become addicted, so beware!! (seriously, I hear about about the lobster \"mixed right in with the eggs! And on top!\" almost weekly)
Ricotta pancakes: my only \"meh\" & it's my fault . . . I made one of those hasty placing your order when you decide to try something new decisions - always order the French toast!!! Lesson learned! 
Brie & asparagus quiche: creamy & tasty.
My husband reports that the burger is also good & I can certify the frites are defiantly French - thin, salty & crispy.
The best part of this restaurant is that it ticks every box - if you are looking to have a charming experience, with easygoing but attentive service & outstanding fare this is the perfect place.
Bon appetit!
Ps. While it is by no means 'fancy' I personally like to go the extra mile outfit-wise.  You will not feel out of place whatsoever & well, Paris deserves it!!"}
{"text":"We came as a party of around 14 people on a Thursday night at 7:30pm. We ended up staying until 10:30, all because of the slow service. We were seated quickly and had a prix fixe  menu option since we had decided on that when doing the reservations. I had a beet salad, trout, and lemon tart. The salad was refreshing but to be honest, not that tasty, since it was too sweet and too much vinegar at times. Trout was nothing special, just a piece of grilled fish on a bed of kale and mushrooms. The sauce and kale/mushrooms were amazing and cooked to perfection though. In terms of dessert, I'm usually a huge fan of tarts, but their \"lemon tarts\" was a slice of a lemon meringue pie without the top.

And the other thing is that service was very, very slow. It took them nearly 30 minutes before placing our order and there was also so much time inbetween the courses."}
{"text":"Visited for Winterlicious for the second year in a row. The atmosphere is great; we were seated in the dining area the first time, and in the bar area the second time around. Lighting is dim, but not too much so; it sets the mood - good for a date. Servers are super attentive. The food is great; the portions are on the small side though. The oyster special was fresh, and the accompanying sauce was tangy."}
{"text":"Food wasn't anything to write home about. I had the pork belly and I've had much better pork belly at Korean restaurants for much cheaper. The French onion soup wasn't the \"rave\" as other users note, it's boring compared to what I've had in France. Also dessert wasn't that memorable (had the petite fours). Save your money and go somewhere else unless you are here strictly for the people watching (and there are quite a few rich/interesting people to watch) or you like to eat in an old school rich boys type bar setting. For a better dining experience try Blu which is also in the area."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars

My friends and I chose this place for brunch as it was close to the ROM (where we were heading to for the day).  It's located literally 2 minutes away.  This is a place where the ladies do brunch.  Maybe because it was the holidays, but I've never seen so much fur (fur coats, hats, etc) in one place.  Thankfully I had added a sparkly necklace to up my brunch game.

The interior design of the place shows as impressive- definitely an event type of space for a party.  Dark woods, beautiful ceiling and large bar makes this place look pretty in an unpretentious kind of way.

The service we had was pretty good, a little slow but overall everyone was friendly.  We sat and talked for awhile and never felt pressured to leave even though the place started filling up.

Now to the food - it was ok.  The brunch menu is quite simple - mostly egg dishes with one or 2 non egg dishes (waffles was one choice).  I chose the beef brisket hash with eggs.  I asked for my eggs to be cooked all the way through (I hate that runny yolk!) and had no issues or strange looks from the server!  My meal was good but nothing exceptional- it came with potatoes but there was more potatoes than the beef brisket which was a shame.  The beef itself was nice and tender and had a bit of tang to it which helped give it a nice flavor without being heavy.

Overall a nice place to go to with ok food."}
{"text":"Nope. 

The place is extremely overpriced and the food is not very good. We were here end of June and paid $60 per person for not very memorable food. 
The waitress tried very hard to keep up with our group of 15, but none of the other employees seemed to want to help her out until they were giving us our bills. Go somewhere else if you're with a group because they force you to order from a prix fixe menu that will not taste very good or fill you up, clearly ripping you off."}
{"text":"Made reservations for a party of 17 for brunch!  Super service and food was awesome!  Will definitely go again!!! Buttermilk pancakes, croque monsieur with pomme frites were amazing!  Bottomless mimosas with orange or pineapple juice."}
{"text":"I had an early dinner with a friend here on the second floor patio which overlooks Bloor St. We ended up moving tables (it was almost empty and a very loud child came in) before ordering our food and our server was very accommodating of that.

The service was excellent. The wine list was also very well done with reasonable pricing and a massive selection of wines both by the bottle and by the glass.

The food is where they faltered. I ordered a medium rare steak frites which is one of my usual orders for a French restaurant. When it came out it was evidently a nice cut of meat but when I put my fork in it I was certain it was overcooked. The ends were completely brown and when i cut into the centre it was much closer to medium well than medium rare. It's a $32 meal and when I pay that much I usually expect to get what I ordered.

I asked for a new steak and apologized for doing so as I very rarely send food back. The waiter came back once it was ready, telling me that the chef had disagreed with me - the steak was \"exactly how a rested medium rare should look\" but that they had brought me a replacement. This was a lesser cut of meat, almost as if the chef wanted to punish me for complaining about the first steak, but at least it was cooked medium rare.

I would come back for to try the brunch, for a few oysters or for a glass of wine but I definitely won't order a steak here again."}
{"text":"I like La Societe, it is a decent place for French cuisine when I am in this area. I love the ambience and I feel cozy when I'm dining here. The staff are all very nice and enthusiastic! They are attentive and they try to engage with customers. 


I usually order the foie gras here, since I love foie gras. For mains, I usually get the duck confit. I also tried the steak frites that my friend ordered and it was good. Overall, La Societe is a decent place to get some French food after shopping in Yorkville area. It is in a convenient location so I can see why it is generally quite busy."}
{"text":"Decided to come here for Winterlicious after having a pretty good experience last yeah during summerlicious. The Atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice. The décor is lovely and the stained glass above is really a work of art.

Our waiter was kinda of quiet but very alternative. We were a group of 7 and he did his best to give us a lot of attention. I have the lentil soup to start and it was ok, not really what I was expecting but it was ok. I had the chicken for the main and found it to be a little dry and bland. The portion was small but I didn't expect anything more at a French Bistro. I had the lemon tart for dessert and found it a little on the unpleasantly sour side. Since this is a Yorkville restaurant and the food is only ok, I would not come back and pay regular price!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for Summerlicious 2014 and we regretted it. The pâte tasted like it came out of a can. The steak frites would've been more accurately titled \"beef medallion\" as it was the smallest piece if steak I've ever had at a restaurant. We were there for dinner and the steak was smaller than what other places serve for lunch. The meat was also very chewy and ultimately tasted of very poor quality. The frites were actually pretty good. They tasted very Parisian. They were thin, soft and nicely salted. The dessert, a key lime pie, was mediocre at best. While I understand it was their Summerlicious menu, they should still make the food with care and attention. I don't knew what their regular menu is like but I know it's pricey. I would not pay regular price for what we received. The service was also spotty as we never had cutlery when each course was served. So we waited 5 minutes, watching our food, when each plate arrived.

Their interior décor is pretty beautiful... But no amount of design opulence makes up for the disappointing food."}
{"text":"Very beautiful decor and prompt service however the food left me disappointed. We were here for the new year celebration and they had a pre fix menu with some options. My bf and I ordered different things so we could try different options, unfortunately we didn't like any of them as much I we expected. I ordered a raw scallop,shrimp and lopster as a main. The seafood was clearly frozen and lobster was served with potatoes in tomato sauce which i found to be a weird combo. My bf wasn't impressed with his meal either, and out of all courses filet mignon was the best. 
We had a good time but I doubt I'll be returning here because of the food"}
{"text":"You couldn't pay me to go back there again.

The food was okay, but definitely not for the price.  Their (lack of) service and attitude of some of their staff was absolutely horrible.  The decor is nice, but that couldn't make up for it's downfalls."}
{"text":"I went on a Wednesday night for drinks / snacks with a buddy to check it out (it's across the street from my house). I wasn't really expecting much since most restros in Yorkville are overpriced / nothing special. In terms being \"a scene\", the crowd seemed like wealthy Rosedale folk in their late 40s and up. Hopefully younger people pick this place up and it becomes a little more cross-generational. Anyhow, I had a glass of wine (The wine menu is awesome - get McMannis by the glass), Steak Frites (the fries were super skinny and the steak had a slab of butter on top - exactly how I like it!), and the Creme Brulee (i wasn't a dessert person but i think i am now). It was such a great experience (both the food and the service), that my friend is already booking all his clients there and i'm most likely going to head back tonight."}
{"text":"This is my second time at La Societe. Didn't have a memorable impression the first time however, this time was absolutely horrible. The food quality decreased and our server Ryan was rude. He didn't attend to us at all, and completely ignored us while serving the table next to us. When we were paying, the machine didn't connect for 2 times and instead of apologizing, he actually gave us attitude! The only thing I can give about this place is that the decor is amazing. Other than that...the service will make you never want to come back again."}
{"text":"I recently visited La Société for Champagne Tuesdays. On Tuesdays, a glass of Veuve Clicquot is only $12 and comes with a complimentary hors d'ouevre. What a fantastic idea!  It is such a spectacular way to unwind from a hectic Tuesday. It may only be the start of the week, but it can be a rough week already!

Afterwards, a few of us stayed for dinner. I ordered the Rainbow Trout Grenobloise, which came with capers, lemon confit & parsley root puree. It was so exquisite and delicious, I only wish I would have had bread to clean the plate. Extremely bad manners but it was very delicious. The trout was cooked to the right point - very fresh and flaked easily. 

My friends ordered the mac & cheese, tuna tartare and hamburger and everyone raved about their dishes. Good food, good company, a good time was had by all."}
{"text":"On the advice of others, I decided to check this place out.  Top to bottom:

Hostess greeting was adequate but not warm.  They did not offer to take the jackets of my guest and I, which I expect at a place that considers itself classy.  We had come to understand this as a dressy place, yet walking to and from our table could see quite clearly folks in grubby jeans and t-shirts.  The ambience suggests they were the under-dressed, though.

Noise level was astronomical.  This is not helped by the materials used for the decor, and the proximity of tables to one another.  We could hear, and if desired participate in, the conversations of our neighbours.  This is not the place for an intimate dinner.

Despite contributing to the noise level, the decor was splendid and really did conjure French authenticity.  There is a real bistro feel to the lighting, furniture, and visuals that they've used.

Service was friendly and accurate, and mostly attentive.  For a packed Friday night, our server managed well and with a smile.

Selection of wines by the glass was appropriate for the price range of the restaurant and had sufficient variety to suit the dishes.

The food: I started with the mushroom soup, which was very well executed and served piping hot.  Tasty, and do recommend.  I followed with the lamb shank, which was fall-off-the-bone, yet somehow dry and overcooked.  The accompanying beans and veggies were presented in a sauce with more than a hint of orange.  Overall, an adequate but not stellar dish.  My guest had the flatiron steak, which was made to order but still not as succulent as some others in the city.

Accompaniments of mushrooms and truffle mac & cheese were well portioned for two and tasty - again, though, not the best in the business.

Dessert was a shared chocolate mousse.  This is a well-done, rich, creamy chocolate mousse that comes in a goblet with a buried brownie and topped with whipped cream and berries.  Tasty, and suitable for any chocolate lover.

Overall: Give this place a shot on a quieter night or for lunch.  Or, if you want to be part of the hip crowd and enjoy shouting to speak, go there for dinner on a Friday night."}
{"text":"The place has a very Parisian feel to it and the service is good but the food isn't the greatest.

I had the Cobb salad for which they used a spring salad mix from the supermarket as the base and some of the greens were wilted and tasted off.  

3.5 stars for the ambiance and 2.5 for food so I averaged it at 3."}
{"text":"Came here with high expectations and was not that impressed. It was decent food and the environment was great. The appetizers were superb - salad, oyster, ceviche. The mains were standard (short ribs, fish, stew) and I've had better at other lower priced french restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is  pretty authentic as a reproduction of a Paris bistro (down to the narrow uncomfortable chairs. ) It even has Leffe beer on tap. My visit was ruined by an annoying waiter who was too much in your face with comments like \"how can I make your evening more enjoyable.\" And he overcharged for the food. So check your bill carefully. I had steak au poivre but there was not a \"poivre\" in sight. Probably will not go back."}
{"text":"Love their patio on the second level, which overlooks the boutiques on Bloor street! The service was friendly, and the restaurant had polished bistro decor. 

The beef tartare was served topped with a quail egg and served with a side of buttered toast. One downside was the olive oil that was plated under the tartare. It made the dish feel greasy, along with the buttery toast. Nonetheless, it was a good dish that I would order again!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous, large, Parisian-style interior, fantastic food....pricey prices. (But that's to be expected for a restaurant like this...it's got class up the yin yang.) We enjoyed both of our meals here (dinner and brunch)...the tuna tartar and steak were wonderful. But for a French restaurant, the eggs benedict (jambon de paris, they call it) just wasn't up to snuff; if you go for brunch I'd try something else."}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised I haven't posted a review for this place already.
It's one of the places that a close family member loves to go to so I come here because that's her \"go-to\" and I enjoy spending time with her - that's the only reason. 
La Societe is french cuisine which is highly priced and aims to please the upper class, as a result, the prices are high, hostess & waiters are a bit snobby, ambiance is dark and loud. 
The first time i came, I had the steak frites and found the cut of steak to be poor quality. It was cooked to medium rare as asked, but the actual steak was not easy to cut or chew. It reminded me of a cheap cut of meat from an uptight cow. I ordered it again on a separate occasion and it was the same. My conclusion was, do not order the steak frites if you're a fan of steak, you will be disappointed here. The french onion soup was very dark and dense in flavour - almost over bearing. As if they use the same pot continuously without starting fresh new batches to make it. Ugh, not a fan. 
We saw the waiter exactly three times, to take the drink orders, to bring us drink orders (and take our food order) and 10 mins after the meals were served to ask if everything was ok. On my most recent visit, the waiter came by 5 times, which is a bit better. 
For the price and location, I would've thought they would do better. It has an upscale ambiance, but it's very loud inside the restaurant - won't be able to hear the person sitting in front of you unless you both speak very loudly.  
The fact is, if you're going to pay higher prices, you're better off going elsewhere."}
{"text":"I generally don't like places like this, but the setting is quite beautiful. Pretty pretentious, so I guess if you need to impress someone (hey, you're in Yorkville!), this is a good option?"}
{"text":"Service was horrible and slow but management was quick to fix that. We went during oyster night Thursdays ($1/oyster) which were amazing!!! Upon making reservations, the hostess did not state that the restaurant did not accept reservations for the oyster night as it is first come first served in the lounge.

Doubt I'd come back here for dinner as the service was very very slow."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch for winterlicoius 2015. 
Very courteous staff and wonderful decor. The ceiling certainly adds a nice touch to the atmosphere and the bistro style tables were an excellent layout. The noise level was ridiculously loud. It was a little annoying at first, but after a while it settled down as we reached the tail end of the lunch hour.

I had the oysters as the appetizer which were neatly presented but nothing too extravagant. The duck confit however was very good, although just a tad on the dry side.
Main course was very disappointing. We were unable to order the salmon since they ran out and had to settle for the pan seared chicken. While cooked and presented well, the taste got boring after a couple of bites. The potatoes made for a good side, but I was fed up with the chicken very quickly.
Dessert did make up for the rest of the meal which was the warm chocolate cake. A great pair with the ice cream. 
I would consider returning during non-winterlicious times, and explore some of the other adventures in their cuisine."}
{"text":"BRUNCH review only. The brunch options are much more reasonable compared to their regular prices. The food is  clearly of high quality. I thoughly enjoyed the eggs benedict. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the side potatoes were properly moist.

Considering the lack of options for breakfast in the area, La Societe gets an extra bump.

The decor is quite stunning. Good place to go if you need to impress, take pictures, etc.

Bonus for bringing separate bills to a group of 5."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant but the service doesn't quite match what you'd expect. 

Presentation wise, it's good. I guess the quality of the food is good too, but the service is poor compared to the rest. 
I have been there about 5 times and the entire experience did not exactly justify the bill I had to pay in the end. 
I have had different servers every time, and only one of them gave me good service. Once I had to wait 25 minutes for the waiter to get my bill (I actually counted the minutes). Another time I had a waitress that behaved like she did not want to be there. Last time I was there I had 2 waiters and both forgot about my table; a table of 5 people!

It's a shame because the space is so wonderful, large and elegant. Not worth it."}
{"text":"This place stinks. We were here last summer for my birthday. Overcooked burgers and clueless staff. Totally overpriced. I wish I could say, \"well, maybe it was Summerlicious and they weren't serving their best stuff\" -- nope! It wasn't Summerlicious. The interior is tacky; it is meant to look historical but it isn't.

A few months ago some office colleagues suggested heading here for a work-related event. I groaned inwardly. Again, it wasn't good.

I have no idea why the rating is so high on this place. Maybe it has something to do with its location and the perception that it \"should\" be good."}
{"text":"Overall 3.5 stars.

I almost feel bad giving La Societe lower than 4 stars, but this is the consensus among our dinner party of four, so I must comply.

La Societe is what I call an event restaurant, even though it is not outrageously expensive.  The location and the venue are so distinguish that they set a high expectation for the food and service of which, unfortunately, La Societe does not live up to.

Interior Decor: As previously mentioned, the interior decor is beautiful.  It is old time European glamour: grand entrance, tinted glass ceiling, chandeliers, red wood shelves and furniture, etc..  Even the table cloth is impeccable.  Upon entering, I felt like walking into a world of old money.

Price: The food is pricey but not as much as I have expected.  The appetizers are priced between $10 to $25 (seafood).  The dinner menu features a prix fixe menu ($44) that includes an appetizer, a dinner entree and a dessert.  There are a lot of items costing less than $30 on the menu.  Of course, you can also order the $60 king crab legs and the $159 seafood grand tower.  In a way, I only consider the appetizers and desserts expensive; the entrees prices are okay given the neighbourhood.

Wine:  The wine selection is good and extensive.  Our $50 Shiraz was really drinkable.

Food: We all liked our appetizers (oysters, mushroom soup, French onion soup).  While the entrees tasted good, one dining party thought the portion was small given the price.  We all thought the creme brulee dessert was disappointing.  The custard was too watery and too sweet.  One party thought the sugar top was too thin. Given La Societe is a French restaurant, and creme brulee is a classic French dessert, we were surprised and not in a good way.
 
Service:  Our waitress was friendly and prompt, but I felt under-serviced because she was too busy. The restaurant was a full house, and she had to run around to cover many tables.  I had to really look for her to get water refills.  I was surprised because I thought La Societe was known for its services.

Noise Level:  This is the killer.  The restaurant was full, and it was extremely noisy.  We suspected it was the low ceiling and the material of the wall and ceiling, but we had a hard time carrying on a conversation.  We could hardly hear the person across the table.

I asked around everyone on the table, and they felt that, due to the food, the noise level and the service, we were not fully satisfied with the experience.  Therefore, La Societe got 3.5 stars only."}
{"text":"Decor, presentation and vibe are solid.  Food is good.

Probably 40% more expensive than it should be.

E.g., an $18 glass of wine that costs under $20 a bottle..."}
{"text":"Their oysters are so delicious and addictive. I've also had their steak frites here and would 100% recommend. It's definitely a pricier place to eat at, so if you're looking for a different ambiance, I'd recommend this place. However, if you're starving but not down to splurge, then I'd suggest looking elsewhere to eat. Nothing mind blowing here tbh."}
{"text":"Went for a quiet dinner. Was seated in the back beside a party of 20.  The rib eye steak was the smallest 12 oz I have ever had. Quite pricey for the average quality of the food."}
{"text":"The customer service in this place for such a fancy place in a fancy neighborhood is absolutely great. We went for a family dinner with our entire family which consists of 3 little dogs. The manager was so accommodating and flexible. The server bought us big water bowls for our dogs. The food was DELICIOUS too! A special thanks to Karina who helped me with reservations!"}
{"text":"Yummm. The food at La Société is nothing short of spectacular. Just typing up this review has me craving some of the delicious carbs that they cook up here!

A group of my girlfriends and I ended up here for brunch this past weekend. This is a PERFECT spot to check out if you're looking to avoid the crazy brunch madness that can happen in downtown Toronto on weekends. Why? A.) They take reservations (yes!) and B.) Even if you DON'T have a reservation, this place is HUGE. Large patio downstairs, large patio upstairs, and plenty of seating inside. We saw plenty of people come and be seated with no wait.

The inside of La Société is gorgeous - high ceilings, stained glass, gorgeous seating and décor. We sat at a round booth that I could have slept in, it was so cushy and comfortable.

All staff here were very friendly and sweet. The hostess welcomed us very warmly and seated us promptly. The waiter was very present throughout our meal and we were never left with an empty water glass.

The food was soooooooooooooooooo (I can't type enough oooooo's to make my point) delicious. I opted for the French Toast. It comes with a smear of chocolate and some fruits on the side (caramelized bananas included, yum), but the bread and the batter itself is the big winner here. I am a HUGE French Toast lover, so let me tell you I can be a quite picky when it comes to my French Toast, and this is EASILY some of the best in the city. The French Toast was SO good (fluffy, tasty, perfect amount of batter), it didn't even need the side of maple syrup - and that's saying something because I could drink maple syrup straight from the bottle =P. The price point for this dish is great too (especially for something in the Yorkville area!) $12. The sides aren't too pricey, so if you're looking to add on some potatoes, bacon and/or ham  it won't run you more than $3-4 or so.

I sampled some of the friends dishes including the Blueberry ricotta pancakes: Again, some of the best I've had the pleasure of devouring in Toronto. Super moist, packed with blueberries, and the whipped cream on top was even made with Ricotta, too. Heavenly. Quite a large portion size (5 pancakes or so with a TON of blueberries) and it ran $14.

I tried a few bites of the salmon eggs benny & broccoli cheddar quiche - both very good also.

I can't wait to make my way back here!"}
{"text":"- Beautiful Restaurant / great floor plan/ 2 floored patio facing bloor st.
- Great servers/ Polite/ Helpful 
- the presentation and quantity of each plate is just perfect
- Seafood is nice (Not the best in Toronto) 
- Steak is mediocre (compared to a restaurant that is known for steak)
 I actually had to tell the server to take it back since it was dry and way over done even though I simply asked for medium rare) The second time around was better but not up to par.
- great wine menu
- Very tasty cured meat and cheese platter that goes great with a fine glass of red wine. 
-I will most likely go back but only in the summer to enjoy the perks of being on a patio and enjoying a good glass of wine. 
- Iv'e heard that brunch at this place is HIGHLY recommended so I will definitely go back for brunch."}
{"text":"Ohhhh. I like.
We hit La S. on Friday night. What a pleasant reprieve from the freezing Toronto night. Funny-I find that Canadians like to compare their weather to mine in NYC. Oye. Evvvvvryone wants their home to be like New York. Nope. Toronto is FREEZING. Brooklyn is cold, yes. But not as biting. Accept it Canadians. But I digress.

So the man and I hit this spot with the desire for a relaxing drink and perhaps dinner. As a picky vegetarian and neurotic NYC chick who gets anxious about calories, a French restaurant isn't my top choice. Meanwhile I am French. Hah! 
Anyway, who cares. Loved it. Warm, super appealing vibe...warm, super appealing bartender and great regulars at the bar. I love that. 
After ordering our drinks, my boyfriend and I chatted (okay-argued some as well) while enjoying the scene. I especially appreciated the diversity by the way. Not with respect to color(I was the only/one of the only Brown folks), but sexuality. Gay, hetero and in between were well represented. That's appealing.
When my Meg Ryan as Sally (remember?) eating needs manifested themselves, the bartender patiently explained that anything could be prepared to accommodate me. He was great. We ordered the warm pear salad. Quite tasty...though I meant to order it minus the dressing. What can I tell you.

Anyway, we'll be sure to go back when on Bloor."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. Beautiful decor and a great location. I can only summarize with three words. Worst service ever - we were ignored by our waitress - it took over 45 minutes for her to take our order. We were starving so we asked a random guy to get us some bread as she had forgotten to give us some. Then the food came very unevenly. She never offered coffee refills our to add hot water to the tea. Insult to injury she came to take our sugar to give to another table. I am sorry I normally leave a large tip but I could not justify even 10% for this lady. 

Food was alright though! I had the short beef rib hash and that was succulent and juicy but potatoes were over fried and dried up. French toast is lovely. My girlfriends did not like the fries or frites - they were mostly burnt and tiny. I would visit this place again if I could just have the French toast and avoid that particular server."}
{"text":"I'm quite charmed by this place. On the second floor overlooking busy (and swanky) Bloor Street, La Societe excels at every detail. A beautiful setting that exudes classic French brasserie-meet-all the deco glitz of the 20s, everything here is tempting and transportive. 

They do a wonderful, modern, fun spin on French cuisine for lunch, dinner, and best of all, brunch. In a city that loves it's brunch, La Societe is a welcome addition. The French Onion soup is decadently stuffed with carmelised onions, topped with toasted baguette and copious amounts of melted Guyere. Matched with a baby greens salad--topped with pears and a nice mustard champagne dressing made for a delicious lunch. Yes, La Societe isn't cheap, but the portions are hearty. It's a great start to a day strolling around Yorkville--where nothing, not even the window shopping, comes cheaply."}
{"text":"Decor? Grandiose and elegant.

Service? Prompt and professional.

Food? Way too salty.

I wanted to like La Société, I really did. It's not easy to find real French cuisine that's at once authentic and gratifying in Toronto. I heard many good things about this place, so I had high hopes.

We sampled their foie gras, which was decent. Far from the best I've ever had but it sure hit the spot. 

For the main course, I opted for the traditional duck confit, and it was practically inedible. French cuisine is supposed to have delicate flavors and this was sub-par. 

Sassafraz, another high-end French restaurant in Yorkville, is a better choice."}
{"text":"Well, I can say I'd come here just for the ambience of the restaurant. The place is gorgeous. It's classy, dressy, and a good place for a night out. But I think this place is just average for the food. I've come here twice now. Once for summerlicious few years back and once few weeks ago for an early dinner. 

Let's just base this review on my recent experience. We went on a Thursday and started with the $1 oyster special. These were the SMALLEST  malpeques I have every seen. Seriously, I know they're suppose to be $1 specials, but I've had really decent sized malpeques at other restaurants during their specials night.... they also had very few condiments for the oysters. They don't come with those big trays that other places have. 

I also tried some other oysters which tasted fresh and good. I know regular priced items are usually better, but most places try to give you good value on the specials too. I'd say if you like oysters, just skip the specials here. It's so frustrating to eat them when there's like nothing there to begin with. 

The other food we ordered were okay, got some sides and a few drinks. Nothing really stood out though unfortunately."}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous! I came here for dinner one night and thought the food was quite delicious, however, their portion sizes are fairly small. The pricing isn't bad, I think I will visit again - perhaps for brunch."}
{"text":"Efficient and friendly service. Beautiful, spacious and comfortable patio. They had decent eggs florentine, had a little citrus taste to the bread."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for brunch! 

Came here for Sunday brunch recently and enjoyed a lovely, unhurried meal. I like that you can book through OpenTable right on Yelp and considering that so many places in the city do not take reservations for brunch, this is a big plus. When catching up with an old friend, it's nice to just show up and not worry about waiting in lines! I was glad I reserved, because the place was really packed. Tables were a little bit squished together at some parts, or maybe that was just everyone's huge shopping bags getting in the way... 

So La Societe is one of those places that you come to for the ambiance, and in that respect, it totally delivers with Parisian charm. It's all mahogany wood, brass rails, and fancy lighting. Very warm and cozy, yet chic.The pièce de résistance is definitely the large and colourful stained glass ceiling -- just stunning! It reminded me of the Palau de la Musica Catalana in Barcelona (http://www.palaumusica.org/)! The crowd is very ladies-who-lunch with the usual pretentiousness of Yorkville (it even makes me use pretentious phrases like \"pièce de résistance.\" I apologize.)  

I would come back though, because behind all the style, there is substance there too. The food we had was solid, and depending what you order, the prices are high but not exorbitant. (The drinks are another story... $6 for a small glass of juice? $5.50 for small a cappuccino?). I had the french toast. I wanted something sweet and was debating between the waffles, crepes, or french toast. I asked the server and she recommended the french toast without hesitation. I could see why. It was rich and buttery spread with chocolate nougat and caramelized bananas, dusted with icing sugar and served with maple syrup and whipped cream on the side. Heavenly. And for $10, I felt it was more than worth it. My DC opted for the eggs benny, which he thoroughly enjoyed. 

The options for brunch are quite extensive with salads, soups, seafood, and croque monsieur/madame (I think i will try that next time), so there is something for everyone. This would be a perfect place for brunch with the girls, post-work drinks, or a special occasion. I will definitely be back to try the prix fixe and sit on the patio once it's warm again."}
{"text":"Talk about over-priced, under deliver. The food was decent at best for small portions with crazy prices. Nice decor but not worth it!"}
{"text":"The interior of this restaurant is just beautiful and incredibly artsy with real candle sticks and an old fashion pub feel. The restaurant is located on the second floor and has a nice view onto the other side of the Yorkville. I also found the washrooms to be clean and am glad to see that it kept the same old fashion theme in there too. It's just too bad that of the two faucets, one only had cold water and one only had hot water. 

The place was upscale but it had a relaxed feel to it on Sunday night, which I appreciated because we spontaneously went there after finding it on the Yelp app. I was searching for a nice place to take my new-to-Toronto American girlfriends.  

The food was good, the wine was good, the venue was great and the company was amazing!  The noise level was not too loud which allowed for good conversation and overall it was a fun and entertaining experience."}
{"text":"A little piece of Paris. 
Its amazing interior takes you to the different place and time. 
Delicious appetizers, weekend brunch, creme brulee and really good drinks (try green tea gimlet) make it my favorite place. 
If you're into French cuisine and France in general, this restaurant is a must!"}
{"text":"Don't come here for dinner! My friend and I knew that this restaurant was known for their brunch but we've been dying to try this restaurant so we came here for dinner.

It was a rainy day so their patio wasn't open so we sat inside (it was quite full but there were a few empty spaces so we didn't have to wait). The service here was incredibly slow. It was busy that night but it wasn't packed so I was surprised by how slow their service was (or maybe they wanted us to have the laid back European experience).

My friend ordered High Society drink (St. Germain, Prosecco, Soda, Lemon Twist) and it tasted too sweet for my liking. I ordered Le Societe Smash (it has ginger beer, I believe Crown Royal and some other things I can't remember) and she said it tasted like medicine to her (I concurred with her).

We split an appetizer of deep fried frog legs because we've never had frog legs before. Although it was our first experience with frog legs, we were not impressed after our first bite. We find that the batter was overpowering the taste of the frog (perhaps frogs don't have much taste?). I have to say they seasoned the batter very well.

My friend ordered duck confit for her main entree. It was very dry and she didn't enjoy the sauce that it came in (that's more of a personal opinion). I ordered the duo of Ontario rabbit and it was better than her dish. I've never had rabbit before and it tasted like Chinese braised pork. It was a mediocre dish so I can't comment more on it. If you've never had rabbit before you might want to give it a try.

We were somewhat disappointed with the meal so I suggested that we don't order dessert but we couldn't help ourselves. She ordered the creme brulee with earl grey ice cream. Surprisingly, the earl grey taste really came through! She also enjoyed the creme brulee because it wasn't overly sweet. I was torn between a deconstructed dessert (I believe it had yogurt and peaches) but the waiter recommended pear tarte Tatin. I kept on thinking peach tarte Tatin so I was disappointed when it came (not the restaurant's fault at all). My friend really enjoyed the crust and I thought it was good too.

Would I come back here? Only to try their brunch but not again for dinner."}
{"text":"My partner and I went for their brunch today. The food was excellent. I had the quiche of the day and he had the lobster Benedict. The food came out super fast...a little too fast. It was almost like it was all prearranged in the kitchen. But no complaints on the quality. 
We did feel the service could be better. Our server just quickly wanted our order and left. We felt the service was a bit rushed not very warm. However, to his credit, everything we asked for was given to us right away, so I can't complain to much. 

We will come again, but probably when the brunch rush does die down a bit."}
{"text":"The decor and ambiance here is amazing. We got a seat in the booth and had a lovely view of the grand ceiling. I came during lunch time and the place was not busy, however service is quite slow. For food I got the trout sandwich and it was super delicious, however it was very oily. The salad that came with it was not very good. Any how I would definitely come back to try more"}
{"text":"I came here for my friend's birthday brunch. We had a little room sectioned off since we were a bigger group which was nice. However, that's all the only nice thing I can say about the place. 

Food: Really salty. I got the short rib hash off the menu. It looked delicious but every bite I took was like I was eating salt off a spoon. Not good.

Service: Really slow, we waited probably 30mins+ to get our food  and on top of that, our waiter was rude. When it came time to pay, our group had split a few dishes, but for some reason, I got charged an extra item. When I told the waiter this, he just took my bill and started asking around the table who wasn't charged the extra item and when no one responded, he just walked away.. He didn't apologize for the inconvenience, he didn't tell me what he was doing, just walked away. When he came back with a new bill, before I even got a chance to review it, he handed me the credit machine. Since we had a large group, 18% tip was automatically added onto the bill which I wasn't happy about. There was a second waiter that came near the end to start clearing our plates because for almost 30 mins, our initial waiter was nowhere to be seen. The second waiter was great, too bad we only interacted with him for about 30 seconds. I don't think our waiter smiled once when we were there. The only time he smiled was when we were all leaving, and he even waved too. Not impressed.  

Overall, it was not a good experience. I will not be going back and I've already started telling people to avoid this place. You can get tastier food at cheaper places with better service."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch at a beautiful French styled cafe. The menu had plenty of proper brunch options and a wine list to match. The only thing better than the croque madame was the ambience."}
{"text":"The food was good. Good, not amazing, not spectacular but good. The portions were sad, the plate decor was decent and the service was horrible. I went with a large group and we ordered all kinds of things on the menu including seafood, chicken dishes, burgers, desserts, duck and a few other main dishes. Everything was just mediocre. It's sad because I wouldn't mind if the service was good and the portions were larger but that didn't happen. To top it off the place is ridiculously loud and hot and the drinks are served poorly and they're not made well. I had great expectations for this place I guess. But it's an overpriced spot in a location which allows for it. The chefs have potential but they're in the wrong restaurant. This is nothing like Parisienne dining."}
{"text":"It was a great French restaurant I've ever been. 
Easy to access from downtown core. Don't worry about the parking lots. Green P is near by walk for 5min. 

Pleasant atmosphere and very comfy place to feel downtown Toonto. 

Great food and service."}
{"text":"Went there last night for my birthday dinner. I've been looking forward to a seafood tower ever since I saw Anthony Bourdain devour one in Paris. 

We looked all over Toronto for restaurants that still had this on the menu and we were delighted that La Societe had it! We loved their brunch here but never had a chance to come for dinner until last night. Our waiter was super informative on wines and was very personable - Sean I believe was his name.

We ordered the seafood tower, the roasted and pickled beets along with a bottle of their New Zealand Cabernet Sauvignon (who he'd paired perfectly with all the seafood). My husband thought he could also finish the 8oz steak we ordered a quarter way through the tower but them quickly realized that his eyes were too big for his belly. Luckily we were able to cancel that order but it will leave us something to try next time!

The ambiance was nice and cozy, my husband and I were seated in a booth with candlelight and the music was so good. Sampled music from popular songs we grew up with, it was nice for us to guess and enjoy the songs all night.

Overall the food and service was great! We will definitely be back. Thank you for making my birthday dinner so memorable!"}
{"text":"LS (formerly La Société) recently rebranded their restaurant in June.

A petit piece of Paris centrally located in Toronto's Yorkville neighbourhood, LS is a departure to another time and place. We invite you to spoil yourself with unmatched atmosphere, design, service and delicious menu offerings.

They had a media event last evening to showcase their new menu. I received an invitation.

Though they haven't really changed their brunch menu since it is well-received, they have added 60% to 70% new items to the dinner menu.  There is also a bar menu and you can get late night snacks.

There is lots of space, depending on where you want to be.  You can sit downstairs on the street level in the comfy patio and get grilled food.  Or you can head upstairs and sit on the patio there.  Or you can head inside and sit in the dining room.  Or you can sit in the bar, which is where we were.  There was a DJ spinning tunes when we left.

It's a lovely restaurant and we were treated very well.  The food was delicious!  You should check it out if you are in the Yorkville area and in the mood for a piece of Paris!"}
{"text":"La-OK

The restaurant boasts a lot of high end qualities but its faults to me out weigh what it trying to be achieved here. The food was good but not great.

The French Onion Soup was REALLY rich (which I understand isn't unheard of in French cuisine but I really found it hard to eat at the end of the day). I had the pan seared trout which made up for it.

I was having difficulty determining if the restaurant was trying to be a high end diner or a fancy, yet casual french restaurant setting.

I did however have some of the BEST Gin and Tonics in the city, so there is that :)

Service was way slow but it was a busy day when we went so I'll give them a bit of a break on that but it left a bad taste in my mouth.

The food is OK but it isn't where I thought it would be."}
{"text":"So the food was good but it wasn't amazing. For the prices they have on the menu i was expecting much more. 
Me and my friends went to brunch here it was satisfactory. 6/10 for overall experience 4/10 for food only because i asked for me burger to be medium and it came out very well done that i even tasted it being burnt. For a $20 burger i expected much more. They comped me on the burger which was cool but id rather pay for the meal and enjoy it than not pay and not enjoy it.

The pancakes were ricotta blueberry but we only saw a tiny slab of ricotta on top. It mightve been in the batter but we didn't taste it. Still delicious pancakes! 

Overall i probably won't be back but at least the decor was pleasant"}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst meal at its price point. Everything we tried wasn't even close to par. What saves a star is the ambience and the adequate service."}
{"text":"We were there on a Tues night for an Eventbrite event. It was my female friend and I. My friend ordered red wine by the glass and enjoyed their selection. We split a mulles et frites (mussels & fries) and they were delicious with a small amount of onions sautéed butter. And the establishment let us switch the fries for a house salad. 
The service was great once we were able to find someone to serve us given it was a busy event. But once we had a waitress she was very attentive! 
I would definitely go back for the food, atmosphere and service. They have a patio in the summer too."}
{"text":"I had brunch here twice whilst visiting Toronto. I was very impressed with the decor inside -- definitely one of the more beautiful spots I had been to. The price definitely matched the ambience of the place -- expect to be shelling out (not too crazy though!) for some of their food! The crowd is very courteous and it isn't a loud spot by any means.

Their service was very professional and kind. Knowledgable about their selection. Great staff. 

Food was amazing- oysters and roast lamb sandwiches were supreme delicious.

I had a great time here on brunch for both occasions. I would definitely recommend this spot for that."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, service and staff. I've been here mostly for brunch and today for lunch. The beef burgundy was perfect (maybe a little extra veggies in the broth but superior).

I'm a little too early for the oyster night but will come back"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the company was great. The server couldn't be bothered with us at all."}
{"text":"Dropped by for dinner just as they were revving up for the evening.  In sum, we had a delightful experience.  My wife loves chicken and the roast chicken was a joy.  I had the duck confit which was tasty and fall-off-the-bone.  Ice cream for dessert which was unique and flavourful.  We've eaten in the bar area previously which I haven't enjoyed.  Something about the design and lighting.  The dining room, however, works well.  Service was quite good.  Plus, we benefitted from a manager who was really working the room and solicitous."}
{"text":"True Parisian cuisine, great ambiance and baby friendly service

We decided to celebrate our 3rd anniversary at this fine Parisian establishment and chose an early Sunday dinner. The place wasn't too busy ( I hear Friday nights are quite packed!) and we had the option of enjoying dinner on the patio or inside. Given the crazy hot weather at the end of July, we chose inside and were given a corner booth which made the Little Monkey very happy. She was able to sit between the hubs and I while we waited on our meals and we also had space to park the folded pram. They had a high chair for her and the servers were all doting on her. She thoroughly enjoyed her meal of French bread, beans and some home brought boiled veggies. Drinks first for us adults and a bottle of 2009 Domaine Faiveley Mercurey, a French Burgundy, was just what we needed to toast the 4th year ahead! We shared the best crab cakes we've had to date (and given that I married an East Coaster who takes his seafood very seriously, that's quite the compliment). Our mains were the succulent Sunday Lobster special with fresh mushrooms sautéed in a madeira wine on the side and the juicy Cassoulet (a Crispy Pork Belly, Duck Confit, Niagara Sausage and Lentil combination) with a side of cooked to perfection green beans. Being a creme brule addict.. ofcourse I ordered one. It was good but no where near the one I had in Paris . Given the attention the Little Monkey received here.. she wants to go back and you know I do too! The authentic cuisine, stained glass and attentive service transports you to Paris without the need for a plane ticket."}
{"text":"La Societe is a big comfortable place overlooking Bloor St. There's a nice bar in the back for drinks and oysters. Food is usually very good and there's variety on the menu. The downside is the service which seems to struggle. Little touches like bread, water, are missed unless you ask. Last visit an order for a second bottle of wine was forgotten. This place could be a lot better if the service fails got corrected. In the nice weather maybe try sitting on the second floor patio for lunch."}
{"text":"Le societe is solidly..average. The service is good and the food is average. The decor is Parisian bistro and the patio in the summer time is beautiful. 

I eat here about 2-3 times a year and given my gluten free needs, I often pay more for the safer options and can't try many of the options that others enjoy so my review could be skewed. That said, I never have any complaints about my meal aside from the price. Especially after having been in Paris recent where they took my gf needs very seriously yet I never felt like I was giving up on selection or flavour and the prices were often less or equal to le societe. It's Bloor street, the crowd isn't terrible and I'll keep going back."}
{"text":"Pistachio creme brûlée is to die for!! I went and ordered off the winterlicious menu. Food and service were both great, we even got our own private area. Oysters as appetizers were excellent. We were told their Thursday buck a shuck oysters are the same size (they were big!), which is a great deal. Would recommend the steak as the main course, garlic aioli with the fries was absolutely addicting!!"}
{"text":"The plan was to come here for their Summerlicious lunch but because we booked lunch on a weekend, we did not realize until much later that they were only serving brunch and not lunch. Regardless, my friends still wanted to check it out. I was a little apprehensive at first because brunch is my favorite meal and I have a list of brunches that I want to try out, and La Société was not on my list. But I still went anyway. When I arrived at the restaurant, it really did feel like a French bistro and it had a beautiful decor. 

Once I found my friends I sat down and browsed through their menu and for some reason I was really craving a croissant. So I ordered a croissant with a side of cream cheese. My friends on the other hand ordered the French toast, quiche, eggs Benny and the ricotta pancakes. Each plate looked delicious and every single one of my friends was happy with their choice. Except for me. A croissant just seemed so plain and it was cold and not buttery enough for me. But as luck would have it, several of my friends could not finish their food so I got to eat their leftovers. Yeh! **Oh yeah, that was the plan after all. ;) 

I would have to say that favorite dish from all the dishes that my friends ordered  was the French toast. I could not get over how fresh the bread tasted. 

Now, would I return? Probably not. As I mentioned before, I have a list of brunch establishments  that I want to try, and this brunch was not good enough for me to pay them a second visit. 

My friends will definitely disagree with my observation and are probably planning their return to this restaurant as I type this."}
{"text":"I was here for summerlicious recently. The mani course was phenomenal (steak frites). The steak was cooked perfectly, medium rare as I requested and exquisitely tender. The fries, cooked in duck fat was indulgent and crispy. I enjoyed that the steak and fries were served separately, avoiding soggy fries. In terms of ambience, I thought it closely resembled cafe boulud, also in yorkville located in the four seasons hotel; the quintessential upscale Parisian bistro."}
{"text":"The patio is super nice. Music is jazz that makes the lunch more pleasant. Excellent service and love the beautiful people around."}
{"text":"What a treat!
Just had a taste of their Summerlicious lunch menu and Woooooooooooooow, I know for sure I will be back. I liked decor, felt like in Paris for a moment:) and service was very pleasant. Must try!!!"}
{"text":"This place is swanky, I'm talkin' like Ritz crackers with caviar, slick pomaded hair and bugle beaded flapper dress kind of swanky. Yes indeedy, La Societe's big ticket is ambiance with a capital A.  The ceiling is pimped-out with Tiffany-like stained glass and the floors intricate tiled, while handsome crisp shirted waitstaff and a charming maitre D' gracefully dart around to hobnob and ensure that diners are treated to an excellent visit.  

I was here to treat hubby to a celebretory lunch and actually breathed a sigh of relief when I learned that Winterlicious was in effect here so I ended up scoring the $20 lunch while hubby got treated to Moules et frites, what a lucky fella!  As usual hubby mowed down on his meal like a Dyson vacuum in high extraction mode...

My $20 Winterlicious lunch of 3 courses which consisted of Beets and greens salad/ Spinach Quiche with endives/ and Cookies 'n' Hot Choc dessert was child sized...but I have a child sized appetite so I guess it worked out?  I will say it was very savoury and the hot chocolate was rather fatty so it was a calories vs. quantity kinda meal.

I'm a big fan of the fancy facilities at La Societe, if you like to flush with style it doesn't get classier than having Deco-era Vogue cover illustrations by Benito framed and hanging next to you while you're doing the do @ the lieu.

If you want to indulge your inner high maintenance flapper then  then by all means La Societe is the proverbial Bees Knees!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and had the mushroom soup, tuna tartare, 12 oz ribeye , and duck confit. We thought the food was average as we expected better from a $220 dinner, and therefore expressed our opinion on a photo we had posted on Instagram. 

For context, we don't complain unless something truly bothered us, and what made us very upset is that the girlfriend of the executive chief of la societe decided to post ignorant and unprofessional comments on our photos - The chef himself also commented but was very professional. We understand that she is not directly affiliated with la societe. However to experience this after attending a restaurant with such status is truly upsetting.

An older gentlemen and his wife at the table next to us was also complaining about the food and service."}
{"text":"La Societe looks as good as you'd imagine a restaurant should in this fairly toney area of town.  Today for lunch, I had the croque-madame with frites, and with a little help from a friend with the frites, I finished it all.  This tells me that the portion size was reasonable since I am still quite full as I write this review and also that it wasn't ridiculously decadent.  The fried egg on top of the sandwich was perfectly done.  I also sampled a single oyster Rockefeller which was pretty damn tasty too.  On the whole, the menu looked pretty safe and I didn't see any particularly intriguing combinations of flavours tempting enough to steer me away from a tried and true choice like a sandwich.

The service was okay, but nothing to write home about.  Our server was efficient yet lacked any warmth or humour.  Because I'd read that table sizes are small, we made sure we reserved a booth or \"hot tub\" as they called it on the phone. It was quite comfortable.

I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't rush back."}
{"text":"The outdoor patio downstairs has my name written all over it.  The service was excellent.  We had the crab cakes, mussels and shrimp. And the oysters?!? Yum!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a visually gorgeous restaurant with great service and a fabulous patio on the second floor overlooking Bloor street in Yorkville.  Regrettably, however, I was underwhelmed by the food.   The one stand-out was the seared foie gras.  Not only was it outstanding and perfectly cooked but the portion size was very generous.   We also really enjoyed the frites and the brussel sprouts but my friend's rabbit was overcooked and dry and my lamb shank was tender but not very flavorful with very little sauce.  French cooking is all about the sauce but there was little of it to be found.  I should have ordered the poached black cod!  

I would come back to the restaurant to try it's brunch menu and for drinks and snacks on the patio."}
{"text":"Very nice decor and ambiance. The food was a little salty, I had the venison burger as a special on October 10,2012.  It was quite small as was the salad. We started eating bread and it was cleared away without asking us if we were finished.the Lake Trout was overlooked and too salty also. Seats are a little like an Airport Bar but that is just my perception ."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch, as it's the nearest restaurant to my office. 

The space is decorated beautifully and I can barely believe that it used to be a gold and purple dim sum restaurant! High ceilings, stained glass, very classic French bistro look.

The lunch menu unfortunately bores me a little bit. They have a few salads, sandwiches and mains but nothing that really excites me. I've had the mussels/moules frites (was just OK) and the cobb salad which is actually quite lovely.

A bit on the pricey side with a lot of the lunch menu items costing $25. 

The patio here is absolute primo for people watching on Bloor Street right in the heart of Yorkville. 

The service has always been friendly but notably slow at times even when the restaurant is not busy."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about La Societe but never been there. Today the brunch was great, probebly one of the best in Toronto and of course reasonable price. We almost tried everything on the menu, every part of the food was delicious and great. The warm Scone with cream and jam followed by the short rib and  The frites accompanied by the home made aioli was fabulous.
Ambience and the service was higher than what was expected, so warm, friendly and perfect.
I always think that Life is to short to be waisted so enjoy every each moment of it with your friends and great food.
Good job team La Societe."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and decor of this restaurant. I came here for a celebratory brunch with my parents and husband, and we were really disappointed with the food and the service. 

The service was honestly awful. It took forever for a server to come over to us when we first sat down, and the service became even slower after that (if that was even possible). Drinks and food took forever. My parents ordered the bottomless mimosas, and it was taking FOREVER to get refills. When you pay for bottomless mimosas, you want them to keep coming. We shouldn't have to flag down our server when our glasses are empty. 

I had the cobb salad - it was meh. I've had better. The dressing was nice and mustard based, which was a nice alternative to a heavy and creamy dressing that you might expect. My parents both had the eggs benedict. The potatoes it came with were boring. The base of the benedict was dry. Neither of my parents were happy with their meals. The only saving grace were the buttermilk pancakes that my husband had, which were fluffy and delicious (I had a bite). 

This is super overpriced for the poor quality of service and food. You can get a way better brunch elsewhere for a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"I've gotten all excited about La Societe! Gotten their neighborhood fancy mail specials a few times and reading up all the reviews just made my mouth watered.  So, I decided to make a reservation on this fine Thursday.  Since it $1 Oyster night I thought it warranted a pre plan attack, though it wasn't needed at 730p.  We were greeted promptly and brought to our candle lid table.  The relaxing atmosphere and ambiance were exactly what I've expected. Most tables were empty or their patrons were just impatiently waiting for their bill.  Unfortunately, after 10+ mins no server is to be seen, no water, no \"Hi, I'll be with you in a minute\"...  We had our wine picked and perhaps, delicious food that can be tastes in our mouths, but we just had to put an end to a potentially a bad dinner service. [Sorry, service 1 of 5 stars]"}
{"text":"I'm very pleased with the service that I received, the staff was polite and quick. I ordered mushroom soup with the Truffle oil, which tasted delicious, it was perfectly made. In general, I was satisfied with the place and for sure will come back again."}
{"text":"I've been here regularly, but this review is for the Winterlicious experience.

~Food~
Food was very good! The Winterlicious menu had changed from the time I booked to when we sat down for the meal, but it seemed to change for the better ex. Trout was gone from entree, but Salmon instead. Oysters was on the menu for starter as well. My order was Oysters (3 pieces) to start, Salmon on bed of barley risotto for main and Chocolate Hazelnut bar. Oysters was served with fresh shaved horseradish, mignonette and lemon slice. Very good, hardly any shell. The salmon serving was very small, but perfectly cooked. Dessert was delicious!! Small but with the richness of the chocolate, it was definitely satisfying. 

Overall, quality of the food is 5/5, but my party agreed that portions were a little TOO small. Some of my party went to Mcds after to grab another burger.

~Service~
My party was originally for 10, but a last minute meeting came up an hour before our reservation time, and wiped out 4 members of our party. So when we arrived, we had 6 people instead of the 10. I understand that this is inconvenient for the restaurant, and I was apologetic for not being able to inform them earlier, but I was highly unimpressed with how they handled it. They raised their eyebrows at me, ushered my party to the side, and sat 4 more parties down before attending to our party again. They made no direct comments about us, but made it very clear what they thought. Not impressed with that at all.

Our server somewhat made up for the service at the front. He was friendly and informative.

All in all, best Winterlicious menu I've had so far (food-wise), but portions were small, and the service at the front was offputting."}
{"text":"Unfortunately had a bad experience here.  The restaurant look and feel was amazing and it felt like Yorkville when walking in.

Ended up with food poisoning after eating there and had better french out there for the same price.  hit or miss with this place."}
{"text":"Was here the other day with a bunch of friends. The restaurant is cute and it was really busy. Patio was nice but not much of a view. The location was convenient since we were shopping near by and the restaurant seemed popular so we went to check it out. 

I've heard decent things about this place but right away I was not impressed. Service was extremely slow and despite what I have heard about their oysters they were sub-par at best so the meal did not get off to a good start. I would never order oysters here again. 

I had steak for an entree and it was fine. Nothing amazing but it was not bad. The only good thing was dessert - the key lime pie was delicious, tart and not too sweet. 

Overall, the restaurant wasn't bad but I've definitely had much better. The restaurant wasn't expensive per se but it was not worth the price. I can get much better food for a fraction of the price here and it just wasn't a place I would rave about to anyone. 

I've heard good things about their brunch so maybe I'll come back to try that."}
{"text":"I've come here once before, 1 or 2 years ago, and could not have been more disappointed by how downhill this restaurant has gone ever since on my most recent visit. First of all, we had reservations for a table at 8:30pm, and we were seated over an hour later. The manager, or manager-on-duty did check in on us a few times at the bar. Of all the things he could offer us hungry, empty-stomached guests, he decided to offer us a round of shots at the bar. Shots on an empty stomach! Yay! 

When we finally did get our seats, and we went through the menu, we were told my our waiter that 50% of the items were not available anymore (ran out of ingredients). OK maybe I exaggerate, but a lot of the items that we had wanted were sold out. 

I got the seafood bouillabaisse which hit the spot for a cold winters night. I had ordered a seafood bouillabaisse the previous weekend at a Collingwood restaurant and could not help but compare the two. La Societe's version was supposed to have a lobster broth, but the taste was too light and watered down. And for $30, I didn't think it was really worth it. 

It was my friend's birthday, so the waiter brought us dessert with a candle on it. Most restaurants would give a free birthday dessert, especially if they F things up really badly from the get-go. But ohh no, La Societe does not disappoint. They decided to charge us for the dessert. How low can you go? Very low apparently. Oh La Societe, you've gone down on my \"Never-Returning-Not-Even-If-You-Paid-Me\" List'."}
{"text":"I was looking for somewhere near the ROM to go for lunch when I was in the city last week, and someone recommended this place to me after I told them I love French cuisine. 

At first I was turned off by the location (it's located on the upper floor of a building), but you forget where you are once you're inside - it almost makes you feel like you're in France. 

I had a glass of the Côtes du Rhône based on our server's recommendation and really enjoyed it! We also received complimentary bread that was my ideal bread - soft and doughy with a crunchy crust. The only thing that would have made it better is if it was warm.

For my meal I had the omelette with woodland mushrooms, la sauvagine cheese, and pear frisée salad. Everything was good, and I particularly loved the cheese. The \"salad\" is a bit misleading though, since it's just a few slices of pear and only a few pieces of frisée placed on top of the omelette. For $19 I would have liked an actual side salad with it. My boyfriend had the Croque madame, which was absolutely delicious! If you're in the mood for hearty comfort food, this is it.

We came here for lunch, but I'd like to return for dinner soon to try out some of their meat entrées!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch. Was starving and our food took forever to arrive. Just getting coffee to the table took 25 minutes. The bathrooms were gross - empty toilet paper roll on the floor, hair everywhere, broken door. Kind of shocking for such \"fancy place\".

I ordered the cobb salad. The lettuce was soaking wet so none of the dressing stuck. The veggies were wilted and brown and the salad was bland. I left over 75% of it on my plate, yet the server didn't bother asking if there was a problem.

I caught a glimpse of the bartender behind the bar making a mimosa - using generic brand OJ and cheap prosecco so hot tip: get a mimosa elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Been to la société a couple times- once for dinner and recently for brunch.

I have to recommend the dinner hour. More dynamic menu and a quiet ambiance... Parfait pour se détendre.

 At brunch I had the steak et frites. Lovely steak, fries a bit too oily, but la mayonnaise maison saved the day. You have not had mayo until you've had it house (or at least French) made.

For dinner service, I highly recommend the seared foie gras appetizer, and any of the main entrées. The Duck confit and rainbow trout were both satisfying. 

I RECOMMEND- Their glass of rosé with brunch. Mimosas are so overrated. 

EXTRA TIP- the Sunday brunch hour dies down by 1pm, so no reservation is typically needed past 1:30pm."}
{"text":"4.5 stars based on the Prix Menu that available for dinner 7 days a week! 

Talking about PATIO!!! La Societe is the place if you are into Patio! That patio right on the sidewalk of Bloor Street is so so neat... and place to be on a nice summer evening or anytime when the weather is nice! 

Upstairs where the main restaurant is has another patio...and La Societe is huge and so beautifully decorated! There are a lot of wait staffs working here serving customers and you always get excellent and attentive services! 

Prix Menu ($36) though limited in choices... but I know I want Steak Frites as main so I definitely suggest you stay with the Prix if you are in for the value. 

Appetizer: 
Boston Lettuce with Roquefort and Toasted Walnut Vinaigrette is A OK... I love walnuts so I really enjoy the salad... light and refreshing! 

Main: 
Steak Frites was a little more than medium rare... but it was still juicy and tender... It can get pretty heavily with the butter as garnish as I could not finish even half of that and my dinner mate is in luck to have the rest of my steak! 

Dessert: 
Warm Chocolate Lava Cake for sure is the winner! My dinner mate refused to share that with me and he was practically licking the plate clean... 
Creme Brulee was so so... not bad but in comparison to warm chocolate cake.... I want to have that cake all by myself!! Why am I stuck with the creme brulee??!!! 

Next time when I come to La Societe again, I want to sit in the Patio drink some white wine and have some oysters and pretend I am somewhere in Paris......"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch the other day and I have to say I am extremely impressed. Not typically one for a French restaurant, but what an experience. 

We ordered the large platter which is $149. It comes with oysters, King Crab legs, Tuna Tartare, seafood ceviche, shrimp - OMG this thing is amazing and I am not that into seafood. The Tuna Tartare was the real surprise for me - I would literally eat this stuff up off a dirty street if I had to. 

After the tower we each had sandwiches. I had the Croque-Madame while my partners in crime had steak sandwiches.... throw in some unbelievable McManus wine and you have one of the most stellar lunches of the month... 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Writing a super belated review for Winterlicious 2015. I came here for dinner, and it was my first time at the restaurant. I ordered oysters, the pan seared black cod, and Grand Marnier creme brulee, but also tried a bit of the braised short rib and French chocolate cake.

A quick summary from what I remember:

Oysters - nothing too special, just your typical oysters, but they tasted fresh.

Pan seared black cod (with chives and lemon crushed potatoes, purple kale, potato wafer, braised leek) - I remember REALLY liking this and being glad that I picked this over the short rib which I was debating between. The fish was very soft and flavourful, and the skin on the cod was slightly crispy, just perfect. I also really like kale so I remember enjoying that component to my dish as well.

Grand Marnier creme brulee - I enjoyed this as well, although I didn't really taste much creme brulee. I remember tasting a hint of a citrus undertone to it which was thought was unique and interesting, in a good way. Perhaps they were just placed too close to the lemon meringue tarts. Either way, this got a thumbs up from me, although the lack of Grand Marnier flavour might disappoint some.

Braised short rib - The rib was cooked well and was very soft and delicious, and fell right off the bone. It was good, but I didn't think there was anything innovative that stood out about it. Also both my date and I noted that the portion seemed a bit small.

French chocolate cake - I'm not a huge chocolate cake fan, so I can't say much about it. Chocolate fans would probably enjoy it though, it was very rich and chocolate-y, and not too sweet.

Staff were friendly and service was fine. For some reason I'm not a big fan of the stained glass ceiling - it does weird things to the lighting and is distracting and I find it to be just the tiniest bit gaudy. But that's just me. Overall it's a nice restaurant, I'm glad I had a chance to try this place, and I did enjoy my experience here."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in my Neighborhood. Foods always great. Service is hit and miss. Best night is Thursday night for $1 oysters."}
{"text":"The decor is nice the service was good.  Everything else meh. 

Had the seafood tower the shrimp was mushy. The tar tar tasted super fishy.  And it was overpriced!  I had way better with lots more stuff for half the price ridiculous.  

We had a few more things that not even worth mentioning.  Over all the food is just meh. 

Cool place to come for drinks and chill but that bout it.  2.5 star out of 5"}
{"text":"I genuinely like the food at La Societe, but the prices are reflective of the prime location it holds in Yorkville. 

I keep returning because it has a convenient location with decent food, beautiful decor, and they validate parking up to $15. If you are determined to try La Societe, I would recommend this place for brunch/lunch over dinner as it's an extremely expensive place to fill you up unless you go on Thursday nights for their oyster and crab claw specials. I feel like the portions get smaller and smaller every year.

Service is a toss up. It's either the expected standard or super terrible. I've been here maybe 8-9 times and I've had decent service but I've also had terrible service to the point where I had to talk to the manager and he had my party's whole meal reimbursed. Most of the bad experiences occurred on the bar/lounge side opposed to the dining side though. Never had a noteworthy service experience to share.

-----

Today, I came here for dinner with a friend and we shared the scallop carpaccio, ahi tuna, and steak & frites. All the food was delicious... but the portions? Quite possibly made for a mouse.

The scallop carpaccio was yummy - but wasn't really a carpaccio? It was more of marinated scallops on a bed of some sort of carbohydrate. Delicious and would love to eat again... but not for the price (~$20+).

The ahi tuna. Whut...? Only 2 chips? See picture for reference.

Steak and frites. The only thing we ordered during this meal that was semi-worth it but small for $32. It won't fill you up for dinner by itself (especially when the 2 sauce pots together are equivalent to the size of the steak). The steak was done perfectly. Perfectly sauced and cooked. The fries & accompanying dips. Absolutely in love. 

Service was polite and the waiter asked if I parked downstairs to validate it and explained how to operate the payment machine (points for you, sir). Usually I ask the maitre-d on the way out for validated parking.

Total bill: $108 without tips. Craziness."}
{"text":"I went to La Societe for lunch and our waiter was extremely pleasant and attentive to our table. However, the kitchen was extremely slow and the food was just ok. I was expecting something a bit more spectacular, maybe it was just high expectations that got let down. Nonetheless I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"We arrived without a reservation on a Thursday night. When we asked for a table, the hostess consulted her seating chart and said, with a regretful tone, that there was only one table available- signalling, correctly, that we should lower our expectations for the experience ahead.  We were then seated at a not-so-bad table, and waited 10-15 minutes for our waiter to appear and offer sparkling or tap water.  At this point we were fully ready to order, and to speed things along we bypassed the water stage and ordered a couple of drinks off the menu.  Another 10 minutes passed as the waiter retrieved our drinks, then excused himself for another 10 minutes to retrieve water. Having dropped off the water, he then drifted off again for another 10 minutes, so we're well up to 30 minutes before our order is taken-- moules + frites for both of us.  The room itself is pleasant enough-- though it borders on a caricature of a french bistro.  The moules frites were very good, nicely presented, and arrived in a reasonable time.  By the dessert stage we were tired of the inattentive service, and  decided to ask for the cheque.  On our way out my partner stopped in the washroom, to find that it had gone completely without upkeep - filthy, no toilet paper, etc. When she pointed this out, the hostess did not seem surprised or apologetic. A fitting coda to a trying and tedious evening.  I don't get these Toronto restaurants spending millions on redecorating then cutting corners on staffing, to the point where you're begging for waiters' attention, or something so elementary as toilet paper in the bathroom.  I will stick with Tati on Harbord for French Bistro cuisine."}
{"text":"Great French bistro in Yorkville!   Delicious food, wine and fabulous outdoor patio.  Highly rec'd!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Our cheese omelettes didn't have promised Boursin cheese. Our Nicoise salad was skimpy with much less tuna than before. Is the restaurant downgrading its meals?"}
{"text":"SUMMARY: 
Overall, I've experienced better. Although I must admit that the decor and ambiance is beautiful and amazing! The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming but the food was just underwhelming. 

I came with my boyfriend and my best friend and we were seated immediately. The service took a while because they had some technical difficulties with a fire in the kitchen and the restaurant was fairly full. Nonetheless, the food was nothing special and I will not be returning anytime soon. 

MY MEAL:
Dish: Seared Foie Gras - Concord grape, walnut, pain au lait and mulling spices
Review: This dish was good but not amazing! It was different because foie gras is not traditional served hot but it was nice to try! Just overall not overly impressed.

Dish: Smoked Duck - Beets, watercress and hibiscus
Review: I liked this app, it was really light and not too filling. It wasn't amazing and I've had duck apps prepared better but still just what I needed that day.

Dish: Gnocchi - Blistered tomatoes, herb pesto and ricotta salata
Review: The gnocchi was good but nothing to rave about. 

Dish: Duck Egg Omelette - Boursin cheese, greens salad
Review: Thoroughly disappointed, I picked at my meal. The entire dish was plain and I only ate it cause I knew I was paying $19 for it and I don't like to waste food. It was really something I could've just made from home but better. I am never ordering this again"}
{"text":"Just had a taste of their summerlicious dinner menu and wow, I'm highly impressed. Even their bread was delicious! I had Parisian gnocchi for main and it kick's the Italian gnocchi's a**e (sorry, didnt know how else to put it). The dessert absolutely blew me away. Not only did it look like a piece of art, but it tasted amaaaazing! Flavour combinations were genius (so is their pastry chef!). 
And the service was top notch!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a great location on the 2nd floor of the Colonade.  It is open and the stained glass ceilin was magnificient!  However, it was a little noisey and I wouldn't describe it as romantic or cozy... it had moe of a \"bustling\" feeling.  The tile floo is sweet and I can see that the vibe was auhentic french bistro...right down to he napkins! 
FOOD:  I loved the High Society cocktail.  It's expensive, but essentially 2 drinks (as they brought a side carafe of \"extra\").  The french onion soup was DELCIOUS.  Highly recommended.  My Mum had the salad which she raved about... Entrees-- I had the duck 2 ways, very very good.  Mum had the rainbow trout, also crispy flavorful and good.  We shared the brussel sprout side.  The apples and nuts in the roasted brussel sprouts made it perfect. Dessert-- chocolate lava cake and creme brulee.  Both excellent.
SERVICE: we had a rather reserved server.  She lacked wamth and was not very helpful, but it was acceptable."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and discovered they were doing winterlicious. We decided to go with the winterlicious menu will come back for the rabbit later!!

The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. I love coming here because it feels like you are someplace special.  

They were setting up for some sort of construction in the bar area but you only discovered that when you went to the loo (which was really clean). But there was nothing in your way.


So food, got the cauliflower soup, the beef short rib, and the creme brulee for dessert. 

I want to eat this every week. Every single week. 

I've been a few times but this was honestly one the best I've meals i have ever eaten here.

Waiters are always wonderful."}
{"text":"So many things went wrong. Firstly, we wanted the ceviche but the waiter said the tuna tartar was amazing so we changed to that. I do appreciate service that recommends so it was a great start. However, he comes back around after 30 min to say the tuna was sold out so we could go with the ceviche after all (took him 30 min to find that out?). I ordered a watermelon julip - it took 40 min and the waiter just kept saying the bar was busy. Then our main course comes after 1 hour and 45 min! And it is all wrong. We ordered 4 burgers (which is supposed to be one of Toronto's top burgers - I disagree) and they mixed all our orders in terms of well done or medium and which had cheese. Then we received an eye-roll from waitress who brought them. The burgers were overcooked, dry and flavourless. It's a great patio but I will never go back."}
{"text":"After doing some shopping on the bloor strip and in need of some nosh I decided to check out what all the hype was about here.

The outdoor bar and patio on the sidewalk is what really attracted me.

The hostess promptly seated us on the lower patio and we were handed a small menu but we were hungry and asked if the full dinner menu was available on the patio. The server politely brought us over the full dinner menu but informed us that those menu items were only available upstairs in main dining room and upper patio. So we decided to go up and eat. Unfortunately the upper patio was full so we settled for a table in the dining room at no wait.

The hostess left us with the menus to browse and soon after a waiter brought us a basket of bread. However no one returned to fill our water glasses or even take a drink order. 20 minutes pass by and still no one. We flag a hostess and alert her and she immediately gets a floor manager. The floor manager a very friendly young lady comes over and apologizes profusely and encourages us to stay that she will make it up to us. and Boyyy did she ever!

She starts off by promptly taking our orders. My sister orders the lamb burger and I order the croque monsieur which I had been eyeing since our first encounter on the patio. The manager informs me that the croque monsieur is only available on the patio and they can't do it in the main dining room if I would like anything else. I told her I had my heart set on trying it so she said she would speak to the chef and see what she could do since they don't prep it up here. In the mean time she said choose a glass of wine on the house and she would send us over something to munch on while we wait.

Later we receive a delicious platter marinated olives and we deicded on 2 glasses of pinot grigio. She returns and says after much pleading they will make an exception for me and prepare my sandwich up here.
Service after that is top notch with our waiter refilling our water without being alerted and checking up on us. 
Before our mains arrives they also send us House Salad with a deliciousss Walnut Vingerette.

Alas my much anticipated croque monsieur arrives and it definately lives up to its glory! It is perfectly toasty, crunchy and gooey cheesy, the ham is divine...the best croque monsieur I've ever eaten! and the fries that accompanied the main are also a winner golden brown fresh cut and but soft frites are equally delicious served with a customary dipping of mayo however I also asked for ketchup and the waiter brought it out in little tin cups.
The lamb burger also divine! and is the special on mondays! it has the perfect charcoal flavour on a toasted brioche bun with goat cheese and stewed tomatoes.

Overall despite our rocky begining the wonderful hostess and prompt waiters and stellar floor manager made our evening a delight!  The food is top notch (frites and sandwiches are a must try and definately make reservations if you want a patio seat)  decor is stunning and I will definately be returning for a seat on the patio!"}
