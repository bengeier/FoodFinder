{"text":"nice place.  They had a great guitar player that we listened to while having a drink for my wife's birthday."}
{"text":"The horrible thing about all the time people make to write reviews to help steer patrons away from The Gypsy Bar, is that The Gypsy Bar DOES NOT CARE.  It's futile and they seem to have their own vision that doesn't really include quality service anyway.  Funny thing is the current owner got rid off all the staff that made it this way before and still currently has the same problem.  So to understand where the problem lies is a complete mystery.  We have been patrons for the majority of the time The Gypsy Bar has been open.  Coming in for the amazing happy hour menu and the soothing tunes of the live music on Friday nights.  Jessica our server was always wonderful.  She always remembered our faces and what we drank and was a bright spot that we looked for every Friday night.  However, around mid January the establishment took a turn in feel and service.  Consecutive times of coming in (in grid lock traffic from south Chandler) we were turned away due to \"private parties\" booking the entire area that supports the live music.  I have been in the fine Resort/Hotel industry since I was old enough to work (over half my life) so I understand catering to a client and still taking care of the regulars who keep you alive.  The way they handled this however seemed to be a lack of what to do for the normal patrons by the front line service staff.  We don't choose to go out that often, and when we do we are very specific.  To be turned away the first time then the next consecutive week when we had family in town specifically there to do two things...one, see us and two see the music the gypsy had on friday nights to be treated by the staff where we actually were insulted and scolded for where we were sitting(mind you with no one sitting in this area but us...with 15 minutes left to open it up to the public)...this server was an asian female with two toned hair like the girl on last season's The Voice....then the bartender...James I think ,barked at  my husband when he was only asking for happy hour menus...saying, \"Im not the one you need to talk to\"...Graham, the manager tried to smooth it over with buying a couple rounds of drinks, which was nice, however we feel no matter when we go in there from now on we will be treated second rate and have evidence that we will.  Staff, outside of a couple female servers was arrogant. The people who run things from the kitchen are exempt from this statement.  I was a concierge for almost a decade and I would steer clear of this atmosphere until the management does another complete overhaul and the guest is really seen as the guest."}
{"text":"I will never be visiting this place again.  SNOBBY EMPLOYEES OVERPRICED MEDIOCRE FOOD MINIMAL DRINK SELECTIONS   Hands down the worst beer selection and drink pricing I have seen in downtown Phoenix. Two of their beers that were supposed to be on tap were out. They were out of iced tea. The frier was not working.  I visited here with a group of friends so I did not cause a scene because I wanted us to have a good evening. But honestly, when my girlfriend and I asked for more chips when the small amount we were given with our guacamole appetizer ran out - 1st, the waitress forgot about it - 2nd, when i asked her about it again she said ok, then came back and said that it would be the price of another appetizer to get more chips.  Are you kidding me? Really? Tortilla chips are costing your shag business $9.00 to refill?   On top of the mediorce beer selection, another friend in our group ordered a cocktail and stated that it was not strong at all and even felt watered down. Reading other reviews, I see that other people have felt the same way.  The waitress was the snobbiest thing I've ever seen. I'm not one to put up with that when I go out to eat because I don't go to restaurants on the top of Camelback Mountain. You would've thought little miss thing was working at the Ritz Carlton. She was rude, unhelpful and deserved less than a 10% tip.  Which brings me to my next issue with this extablishment. They automatically grat 20% for parties of 6 or more. that is a VERY LOW number on a party. Most restaurants do automatic grat on parties of 8 or more, and it is usually 18%.  If you visit this business, expect to not be informed of what they DON'T have until you try to order it. You will receive mediocre bar food for insanely expensive prices. You will not get the drink you want and if you somehow do, it won't be what you expected. You will leave feeling robbed, cheated and wishing you went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in the food. The atmosphere was neat and fun but I feel the menu needs to be reworked. How do you mess up sliders? Imagine small meatballs smashed and made into \"burgers\" then cooked until they are dry enough to choke you.  The meat patty was smaller than the bun ( which wasn't toasted) the menu claimed that there was cheese on them but both orders that we got had none. Actually it looked like it had been put on on the grill and then just melted off. We were not serve condiments nor was there anything else on the burger to give it flavor. Double thumbs down.. I got the feeling that the fries were frozen as well. Won't be back for food"}
{"text":"And I love the Gypsy Bar.  You can play arcade games, and go next door to go bowling too!  They also, as i found last week have a photo booth.  Yayskies.  The drinks are reasonably priced, and every time Ive gone, mostly Saturdays for Peep Me XOXO, the music is freaking awesome. AND there is live painting by a variety of artists weekly, I myself have painted there on occasion.  Super cool setup, very respectful of their talent. Go have a good time!"}
{"text":"Myself and a group of around 12 friends were in the midst of a downtown bar-hop in honor of my fiancée's 30th birthday on Saturday, November 10th, 2012. Many of us were wearing 18th century french aristocrat costumes and were jovial, extremely high spirited, and looking forward to going into an event being held at this bar. Upon arrival, the patio-onlookers immediately began to try to get photos with us, the people at the door, and even security were cracking up and excited for us to be a part of their evening. This particular event had a relatively high cover price for some of our party-goers, and being that we were going to make up for any type of cover in many birthday drinks (we had spent an average of over $100 at each bar we went to this night), we felt it appropriate to simply ask if waiving the cover for out party would be alright.   Here is where the first mistake was made - the door people claimed this \"had to be brought to the attention of the manager\". As a promoter myself, if a group of this many people come to your event together (especially those with particularly colorful personalities), you simply encourage their patronage in any way possible. 12 people have a lot of friends collectively...as a bar, you don't want to offend them. On top of this, we knew the party promoters personally and many of the people involved in this particular event, and we had made this clear in the very beginning.  Now for the reason for the dreaded one-star review...the manager.  The manager was visibly irritated that he had been summoned. His first words to us: \"Why should I let you into my bar for free?\" At this point he had been made aware that this was a birthday entourage, but aside from that his comment was loud and intentionally insulting. We are not rude people and were in the midst of an extraordinary night out, so our response was not rude at all. We simply said, \"Well, there are 12 of us, we're going to be buying many, many birthday shots and drinks, and we know many of the people hosting this event. Plus, we look great! We're in costume and even your door personnel, security, and people on the patio are clamoring for us to come in.\" His response: \"I can't just let you in for free, what is it that you even do?\" It was obvious at this point that this man was rigid, humorless, rude, and beyond salvaging our acceptance of just paying the cover and going in (which was never even ruled out). So, we started just laughing at how offensive this man was being to us while he attempted to suggest we take our party elsewhere. He even went to the lengths of following us out and down the stairs of the public walkway, as if to insinuate that we had acted inappropriately and were being escorted.  Gypsy bar - if you read this, I hope it registers that someone felt treated so badly by your staff that they were compelled to take the time to write out a review on this site. I hope it also registers that your bar earned ONE out of FIVE stars on this site without the person writing it even having to set foot in the door. I would highly recommend this establishment to those who enjoy being insulted repeatedly and treated like a third-rate citizen. For those looking for friendly staff and a welcoming vibe, downtown Phoenix has a lot of options."}
{"text":"Came w some girls, drinks are over priced and pizza sucks. Not worth what I paid, it was soooo thin and super greasy!!! Not happy."}
{"text":"Despite a lot of the reviews on here, we love this place. The happy hour is the best around especially for the $4apps. Yes, without happy hour the prices get a little high but nothing too outrageous for being a trendy bar in the middle of downtown. Defiantly recommend the Mac n cheese bites!! And the nachos are big enough for 4! Also the only place I have found since I moved here to serve schofferhofer grapefruit beer, soooo delicious!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. Cool place, music is way better now than it used to be. It gets pretty packed on the weekends. They always have performers on stage which makes it a unique place. The only issue is the bar is always packed and it takes forever to get a drink."}
{"text":"Think about your best and most ridiculously fun and crazy night out. Now, times that by ten and you would then be close to his fun and entertaining Gypsy Bar is. It's not your regular Bar or club. It's fun, mingling, dancing, and excitement. It's nothing like anything before. The staff and bar tenders are amazing and the atmosphere is nothing you have experienced before. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Too bad yelp makes you give a fuck, because i really don't have \"A\" fuck to give. So you get 1 star.  Mgmt was awful and pretentious FOR A STRIVING CLUB. Lol.  They say the first impression is the lasting one and for a club Dave and Busters, you guys are already off to a bad start.  Watered down drinks, inconsistent dress code, and a staff as mindless as the owner....?  I don't get it.  A wanna be scottsdale club, in the middle of downtown phx.......  suggestion: Keep scottsdale in scottsdale. If you need me i'll be fartin elsewhere bro."}
{"text":"Their fries are awesome and so is the spinach artichoke dip. The drinks seemed overpriced to me for their specialty list, by like $2 each. I usually go and get well drinks since they are cheaper so you can afford to play more games. I liked the game area, but I felt like they picked some tacky ticket games for adults. They have a good selection of old and new music as well as a nice dance floor.  It has been completely dead here a few nights though on Fridays/Saturdays..I guess the decor is lacking for people or something..not sure...but for starts, they need to step up their marketing :]  Oh ya we were going to do bottle service here for a birthday, but $600 quote for a dead Saturday night at a bar...was so not going to happen."}
{"text":"This place was a hit with everyone that was with us tonight! We had ages 25-64 with us and everyone had something to do, great drinks, and danced all night. Don't forget to check in and get the $5.00 arcade games and add more to enjoy all of them!"}
{"text":"Was here for a party following an Ingress event (look it up - you'll be glad you did). Excellent food, both the standard bar appetizers and the more extensive menu. Tried the chips and salsa/guacamole, both of which were tasty. The closest things I saw to buffalo wings were boneless and served with an excellent sweet honey sauce. The flatbread pizza was also good. I ordered a quesadilla burger, which is exactly what it sounds like and was delicious, with roasted jalapeños and guacamole with cilantro, and was even cooked to my specified medium rare. Full bar and excellent, friendly service from everyone there. Also, their air conditioning works wonderfully, very important on a hot Arizona day. I hear they have great entertainment from some of the locals, but I can attest to it being good food (not just good bar food) and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food is amazing but I only recommend coming during happy hour which is 3-7 every day. The food is way over priced otherwise. My boyfriend and I came in at 6:30 and were not offered a food menu until we finally saw the bartender again at 7 and we had to ask for one. By then happy hour was over which was a bummer because we paid $8 for 3 tiny corn dogs. On the other hand our bartender, Kelly did learn our names and was very sweet. Lucky Strike was closed at the time for a private party so I understand that the bartender on duty was busy because there were no servers."}
{"text":"It's always a good time here at the gypsy bar and the fact that it's connected to a bowling alley is a plus! But this review is about the amazing staff!  So I lost my phone there last night and came back this morning to search for it. The manager and staff were extremely helpful lifting up couches, searching under all the cushion ... The manager was super nice walking around with the 'locate my iPhone' for like 30 minutes (we even check starbucks downstairs and the dumpster) I think I gave up multiple times but he kept looking for it and holy crap he found it !!! Lane 6 couch ... Strange cause I was on lane 10 last night.... Hm ... (Nice fail attempt to steal my phone whoever you are jerk off)  Can't thank the manager and staff enough! You guys rock !"}
{"text":"This place is located on the second floor and it has a nice view!  The drinks are pricey but they do offer happy hour. You have to check their happy hour and what they offer!  I enjoyed being their customer last Saturday night."}
{"text":"I have to chime in here seeing those B.S. 5 star reviews.  I usually give new places a pass, because I figure they have some kinks to work out, but when I see people shilling for them, I feel it ruins the purpose of yelp.  First, the Bartenders and waitresses are not knowledgeable about mixed drinks, and rather rude.  I ordered a Manhattan, the drink the waitress brought me was made with Scotch.  When I complained, she told me \"Manhattans are always made with Scotch\", she left out the, Duh.  But the tone was clear.  Except, Manhattans are made with Whiskey, traditionally Rye. NEVER Scotch. I insisted, and got a new one, it was passable.  Next, not wanting to deal with the B.S. I order a Maker's Mark on the rocks.  Decent pour, but when I got the bill it was $2 extra.    Now I asked the waitress, and she told me it was extra because a rocks pour is larger.  I find this dubious at best.  The drinks were already pricey, so this just galled me.  If you are looking for a slice of Scottsdale Downtown, I guess this place is ok for you, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"I heard about this place & bookmarked it but it took me a few months to get over to you Gypsy Bar. The atmosphere is casual cool & fun. The clientele not foo foo in the least. We ran in, had a cocktail & bounced out on a Saturday night. We'll be back to make a date night out of the place but were headed somewhere else this particular evening. So I can only report on the atmosphere & one cocktail. Can't wait to come back & of course update my review."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Gypsy's it's a really good time.  Mixed crowd, mixed vibes, nice!  On Sundays Gypsy's has happy hour from 4 - 7.  There's a live band there from 5 - 8.  They really turn the house out.  Super good!  During happy hour wells are $4 bucks I believe.  Call drinks are $5.  Absolute is the Call vodka.  Jack Daniels is one of the $5 call drinks.  There are certain items that are $5.  Some of the food items include: Crispy Chicken Bites which are boneless chicken wings.  Buffalo, Asian, BBQ and ranch dressing was served as dipping sauces.  Crispy fish tacos, Beef and Pork tacos are $5.  Pretzel fondue is also $5.  There's others but I only remember the items we ordered and loved.  I think this is an awesome place for happy hour but I do not believe the food or drinks are worth paying full or regular prices for it.  Just not that good.  Overall, this is a fun place to enjoy Happy Hour with a group of friends."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful and has so much potential but I think the problem is that it doesn't have an identity. the constant changing of things is a turn off at least for me. I've been here many times I've even had my birthday party here& everytime I go it's different. Not really my kind of music but that's my personal choice. Of course anytime you go downtown parking is an issue. I generally don't go into places where you have to have police officers standing at the front door. Tells me I don't want to go there. I pick and choose my battles when I go out. Knowing that there has to be cops at the front door tells me that's a battle I don't want to have. I go every once in awhile with a friend the pluses is there is no cover charge and it's a very large space its very clean its very nice and the service is generally good."}
{"text":"I was at the pool hall next door but you can walk freely between the establishments. What first caught my eye was this bunny (blond w nice body, bunny ears and tail) lackadaisically strolling into Gypsy - I saw that there was a plethora or said bunnies in there, and I tried to figure out if this was a club, a bar or a playground for adults. I still do not have the answer.   It was late, and I was too tired to spelunk down this rabbit hole of intrigue and folly. Maybe I should have followed Alice's example, because unquestionably and with certain I would have found a strange beverage down there that would have pleaded \"drink me\", and I would have foolishly complied.   I will have to put together an expedition and explore this oddity in the heart of downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I came with a group of friends from out of town. We went to the bar twice, once for happy hour and once on our last night in town. They had a great karaoke set up and great drinks. We all had a great time and danced the night away. They also had an arcade. We didn't play any of the games but it was cool to see in a bar."}
{"text":"Alright place but soo expensive?! Went in here after bowling and bought one shot for 10 bucks... will probably not go back to this bar."}
{"text":"I like this place, Met some co workers for some drinks and with the Jenga and basketball it was really fun, I enjoyed myself!!"}
{"text":"Easily the worst establishment in downtown Phoenix. Hands down.   I can't express how badly I wish I could give 0 stars to this place. Disrespect from the second we showed up to the last. I want nothing to do with the employees or the clientele and I'm embarrassed to say I wasted my New Years Eve here. I want a refund of the time I wasted here.   Cityscape is a great thought. There are some gems. Unfortunately it's the trash like Gypsy Bar which will continue to pull the wrong demographic into the area and will lead to the demise of the center. If Gypsy Bar is still open in 2014 I'll eat my words, haggle with cholo bouncers and buy you all an over-priced, watered-down drink from an asshole bartender. But don't count on it.  If you want a real drink in the area - go to the Blue Hound at Palomar. I promise a completely different and improved experience."}
{"text":"5 Star Happy Hour. Bar None, one the best 'secret' water holes in the downtown. How can you complain about $2 Domestic Drafts? The specially priced chicken tacos are a HH bargain. Bartenders are patient and kind.  And, of course there's always a quesadilla to float in front of you too.  This happy hours is not for everyone, but is it is one, for me!"}
{"text":"Came here for the happy hour, and it was bombbbbb. Doug, our server, stole our hearts. He was funny, down to earth, and just plain cool. We will be back. For Doug ... and the mac n cheese bites..."}
{"text":"Needs a better DJ and more promotional events. Nice chill place and great date night but is not meeting its full potential."}
{"text":"Oh where to begin ----  3.5 stars  The bartenders are great and keep the drinks going with barely any wait even with a full house. Well mixed at a reasonable price.   DJ was great and kept the night going. It got good once he read the crowd and mixed it up with current top 40 and hits from the 90s.  With that said the crowd was definitely not the tool - fest you find in Old Town, but it was definitely different.  For the most part the crowd was over 30...and there were all types of people.  For no cover charge, good DJ and bar, it's not a bad place.  Very clean and kept."}
{"text":"So I went to this place for the reviews but was disappointed when I actually went. The music was okay, Latin inspired and the decor was nice, good use of lights but it doesn't feel like a separate establishment from Lucky Strike - that's because it's not, it's a part of Lucky Strike. There's a nice arcade and there are dancers in shadow boxes, the drinks were cheap and good too. The crowd was light, and there were couches surrounding the dance floor, which was large! Overall, it felt like an addition to Lucky Strike, not a separate club. It's a place to bring a date, go out with friends or go after a game of bowling."}
{"text":"Limited wine selection Cabernet wine wasn't good at all but Marlowe was a little better."}
{"text":"This is a dance club? LOL. Guess a place can't determine the crowd that comes in...or can it??  I'll bring extra money to play the games next time. Maybe I'm just antisocial but having a bathroom for me to pee in while strolling through downtown at night was the best part. Zing!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best bars in Phoenix. It's attached to Lucky Strike bowling alley, but Lucky Strike isn't an average bowling alley. There's an arcade room as well with air hockey, guitar hero, a racing game, photo booth, and giant connect 4, among other things.   The burgers here are great, which may seem surprising for a bowling alley/bar, but I cannot stress enough how Lucky Strike isn't like an average bowling alley. It's very modern and somewhat upscale.   The bartenders here are top notch. They are all super responsive and personable. Stephen is my personal favorite so seek him out!  There is also a dance floor and occasionally they'll have some prominent DJs coming in so check ahead and make sure there isn't a cover!"}
{"text":"Doesn't really deliver on promise. The game room is very limited. But we enjoyed some basketball and air hockey.  The food ordered at happy hour was hit and miss. The fried cheese curds were tasty and enough for 2-4 folks to share. But the Brussels sprouts were under cooked. 30-60 seconds more in the pan and yum. It was supposed to be sprouts and kale. Yet kale was missing.   Bartender friendly but not so knowledgable. Anyway, not awesome. Not horrible. Kind of like most of DT PHx..."}
{"text":"This place was freaking awesome. Nice club, rather interesting entertainment, awesome music.   We've never been here before, but I'd love to go back. The dance floor is intense. The pole dancer? Whoa!   Celebrated a friends birthday here. They had food drinks and an arcade.   Get crazy!"}
{"text":"Half the games are broken, worse games than Chuck E. Cheese. Typical boring beer selection. Prezel bites were burnt to a crisp. D.J. Played good music. Bar lost my credit card when closing my tab. Dont waste your time."}
{"text":"It's a sad story that you hear every once in a while, a grand opening kick off party setting low expectations. I'm guessing they will learn to iron out the kinks here though.  With a weekend packed full of stuff scheduled through the Yelp events page, I was excited to cap off Saturday Night with a grand opening party at Gypsy Bar. We heard that theres an adult's only arcade in there, and skee ball is the wifes fave! I liked what Gypsy Bar is doing with the arcade, bar, dance club atmosphere. Apparently, so does half of sun city's most eligible bachelors; the dance floor seemed to ooze ben gay. I wasn't so excited, waiting about 10+ minutes for the bar staff to notice me standing right in front of them, waiving my arms in hopes that they would grace me with their presence. \"Vodka diet, and a diet coke for the DD please\" I said without hesitating; I didn't want to miss my opportunity. $10 later, I wouldn't call it a cheap drink, but I certainly am glad they didn't charge $12 to pour some kettle one into my cocktail; it's about what I was expecting.  We spent a few minutes checking everything out and another 45 minutes or so playing air hockey, skee ball, basket ball, and other games of the arcade variety. My best skee ball score was 34,000, in case you were wondering. I could have done better though, given enough time, money, and dedication to achieving the high score.  I considered busting out my uber white guy moves on the dance floor, but I wasn't really into the 80's / 90's remix the DJ was spinning. Sir mix alot isn't on my personal play list and for good reason.   In need of some personal validation, I was bounced from the girl at the door, to the bar staff (another 10 minute wait by the way), and ultimately the maitre d' desk at Lucky Strike next door to get my CityScape parking ticket stamped. Save yourself some time and skip bouncing from staff member to staff member; go directly to Lucky Strike to get your ticket validated too.  I'll likely check them out again down the line, but I won't be running out the door to make a night of it if there's something better to do on a Friday or Saturday.   Sorry Gypsy Bar, that's just how I saw it. Happy Yelping Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Sort of what you would expect at a slightly better Dave and busters type bar. I do like the pool tables and it's nice to be able to watch the game. If I go back, it will be for the happy hour. $4 wells is a great spot for after work. The food is a-ok. Also the servers and bartenders seemed a bit... Distracted. More interested in talking and hanging with each  other at the bar instead of serving the customers. All in all an okay experience."}
{"text":"Gypsy Gypsie Gypsee...  So, I tried Gypsie Bar at City Scape recently and I was pleasantly surprised. After hearing (and Yelp reading) a few reviews about it, I have formulated my very own take on the place:  GORGEOUS! The views from this bar are amazing. Especially on the Lucky Strikes Bowling side. I drank my Redbull Vodka happily as I stared into the vast array of buildings at night. The seats/bar/layout are very modern and comfortable. The decor is posh. The lighting was not too dark, but not too bright. It was perfect!   FUN- There is a bar, a dance floor, lounge, arcade and a bowling alley. I went with a few friends and had a blast. I could dance it up for a while, then stroll on over the lounge and relax. I am surprised that so many are not raving about this place!   ENVIRONMENT- I enjoyed the environment here. The people were very relaxed, not too dressed up but not too dressed down ect. There was not the \"I'm here to get laid\" vibe which was amazing! Everyone seemed very chill and there genuinely to enjoy a night out.  STAFF- The staff was very professional and sweet. They were not overly pretentious or rude which is rare for the nicer bars. The drinks were priced about the same price as they are on Mill Ave, however they are bigger and not served a plastic dixie cup (lol).  Overall, I LOVED this place! I will be definitely  heading there once again in the future. Thanks for taking the time to read my review!"}
{"text":"Happy hour prices and options are really good. Some of the best in the area. From 3pm-7pm, drinks start at $2. Food for $5. The bartender was nice/friendly and good service. The hostess however, not so much. Rude and snotty. I needed help with my validation ticket and she was \"checked it\", said I was good but still had to pay when I left. Went back and asked about it and her response was \"it's good for 2 hours, maybe they changed the grace period, I don't know\". Annoying."}
{"text":"Wow! I have been living in AZ my entire life and have never been here. A friend told me about this place and the live music on sundays. The food was amazing, the service was amazing, the music was amazing, the games and bowling was so much fun for the entire family. We will be here every sunday. They have a great happy hour for food and cheap drinks. The staff was so friendly and so nice to the kids."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant/bar with dance floor and live music! We need more of these in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great place. We had fun! We were on a Bach party and our bartender was so nice... I think his name was Fernando with the blonde mohawk. We became friends and had fun. He gave us great advice on the good bars in the area."}
{"text":"Tracy is the best bartender! Cool vibe here. Really generous with the orange slices too. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Eh! I wasn't impressed by this addon to lucky strike. There is an identity crisis as well, why the name Gypsy bar? Nothing is Gypsy. The drinks are pricey and the food is meh. Eat elsewhere like at Arrogant butcher around the corner and come to lucky strike for the bowling."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a fun night out. Had dinner at the Blue Hound across the street and we wandered across the street into this nightclub/arcade/bar. What I found unique about this place is that it is attached to lucky strike bowling alley, so it has a great variety of activities for someone who isn't sure how they want to spend their night out. No cover charge. We ordered drinks at the bar and hung out in the arcade playing Pac-Man, & played billiards. We we had an amazing server who approached our group and asked us if we needed more drinks. She ended up taking care of us for the rest of the night, no mistakes on drinks, and checked up on us no matter where we were at in the entire building--Lucky Strike side included. Overall the experience was great. Good crowd, good service. We will definitely be back to hang out!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on Saturday and I didn't like it. The place just does not have a good vibe. Staff members I encountered were nice and the performers were fun to watch, but other than that, this place feels like where dreams go to die. Maybe I don't understand the appeal. You also have to walk thru a crowd of smokers to get in or out."}
{"text":"I love the live art on Saturday nights, and there's a game room if you need a quick distraction. Reasonably priced drinks, could use a design update otherwise."}
{"text":"This place was god awful and such a waste of money. I asked for a Long Island ice tea which tasted like an overly spiked lemonade, so gross. When we took it back and the bartender said that he's made hundreds of theses and he knows what he's doing. Tip Mr. Bartender: Google a better recipe. Your drink was wack! He then gave us a beer in  place of his God awful drink and still charged us $9!!!! Wtf?! The music was bad and the games were not working right.  I won't ever go back."}
{"text":"My girls night migrated to here last Friday after a wonderful time next door at Lucky Strikes. The girls and I only played games for an hour. We laughed and chuckled like big kids in the game room. Then made funny faces in the picture booth. A night to remember. All the games worked well. Our pre-loaded card swiped with no problems. The bar area was packed but the game room was not busy which made it more fun for us.   That was my second time at this venue. The first time was for a party in the bar area and in the private theater room. The food and service was good. I will have to hang here more often as both experiences were great."}
{"text":"Great for a date night. We caught live music next door at the Copper Blues and then played in the Arcade. The inside felt a little run down and some games didn't work but it was a unique experience and will definitely be going back. It seemed a little empty but I actually liked it that way."}
{"text":"I like this bar. Cheap drinks, a full arcade and lively people, isn't that all you want in a bar? I had a lot of fun here and my tab ended up being so cheap.  The drinks are strong and not amazing but they will get you hammered. There was also live art being done by the dj booth when I was there which was mesmerizing.  The crowd is mixed, not too young not too old and there is a good guy to girl ratio, it was fairly even. I will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"It was my best friend's 21st birthday and we wanted to go some place fun with dancing. We looked online and stumbled upon the Gypsy Lounge. The pictures and area seemed promising. So away we went.   There was a great variety of music from today and a few songs from yesterday that you can't help but dance to. The birthday girl even got a free shot! (Kudos). The dance floor was a little small and not a lot of people were dancing which was a shame. In different spots by the dance floor, there were people painting which I thought was really unique.  But if everything seems great, why the three stars? The service. When you eventually got helped, the bartenders had a sort of attitude. They seemed to get mad when they couldn't hear me trying to shout my order because the music was so loud. They take a really long time to make the drinks but they eventually get to you. At one time while waiting for some shots, we thought the waitress forgot our order because it was taking too long. I purchased the shots with my card and gave cash for a tip, but when I looked at my account a few days later, I saw that the tip was also taken from my card as well.  If the service can improve, the Gypsy lounge would be a place I would definitely go to again. In the meantime, I'll try out some of the other bars and lounges that downtown and Mill Ave have to offer"}
{"text":"The only reason i wouldn't give this a 5 star was because they took forever to get to us, and forever to get cashed out. The food came out fast,though. And it was so good for mini dishes. We ordered the sunday 4$ plates.....mac n cheese bites, chipotle chicken quesadilla, flatbread pizza and pigs in a blanket. All were DELISH! Margarita was a little too sour"}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool.  They had a nice little dance floor, a decent bar (a bit pricey for the feel), a Dave n Busters style game area, and a bowling alley right next to it.  From an out of towners perspective, it was a fun time.  BTW, if you want to drink and park, the parking attendant downstairs leaves at 4ish and doesnt return till later.  So just a hint.  You have time to sober up and then not pay ANY parking fees.  I had a hotel, but yeah....oh they had these circus dancing chicks....like go go dancers but hanging from a ceiling."}
{"text":"The best and cheapest happy hour in all of downtown Phoenix! Perfect late lunch spot for all us downtown workers"}
{"text":"Popped in here because one of my favorite DJ's was making an appearance. I met the two managers Daniel and  Bill and they treated me and my girlfriend so well. They had my favorite tequila, which not many bars carry and it was fairly priced. I went from bowling to playing pool, to being on the dance floor for an amazing show all in the same venue. This place is a must see!"}
{"text":"I knew the moment I walked into Gypsy Bar that it was immediately forgettable.  The decor is fine and the staff in \"fast forward\" motion, trying to keep up with the demand for drinks. But...the music just sucks! Baby Got Back? Really? Welcome to 2012.  I hope GB learns from it's auditory mistakes and joins the 21st century."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I wrote a review and message them on fb and the website they asked for my number so they could contact me because they wanted me to have a good\" experience \" ha and to think I thought ok well that's nice . NOPE I even wrote another her comment and they didn't even reply or call it's been a week since then !!   I even wrote a comment on a picture they had posted ! And they deleted my comment !when we got to this place it looked ok and the music was fine a little old school by anyways we go and order drinks well the girl bartender that was in the middle was absolutely the rudest person I had met she even rolled her eyes a few times but hey we were having a good time we were there maybe an hour . My brother in law hands her a cup of water she had given us ! Let me tell you why he had to hand it to her and call her over .... she was ignoring us ! She starts telling the male bartender that he was rude and making comment s ! Come on now really !? You work at a bar if you can't take it don't work at a place like that you work with drunk people duh !!!! But if he was really disrespectful I would have given her the benefit of the doubt but he wasn't ! The male bartender takes over and helps us because we had asked for 4 shots and didn't bring them so he brings them over and starts making loud comments about why the girl didn't want to serve us anymore ! Hence why I know what she told him ! Ok guy that was rude ! We didn't need to know all that or get yelled at it was not necessary why did he think we were gonna let him yell at us ?! I hadn't even taken my shot and he kicks us out and takes my drink and told my boyfriend not to take his and snatched mine right away I talked to the manager (he was an absolute joke ) took us outside talked to me then he said he would talk to the bartenders I told him I wanted my money back ! Then he comes back and says well sorry they said you drank it. !!! Realllyyyy then the manager walks away ! I have never been so upset and disregarded in my life and I work and deal with angry customers who at times tell and I would never treat them this way !!!! Get a different job because all of you were horrible !"}
{"text":"The bartenders at the main bar suck ass..we have open tabs and empty glasses the place is half empty and they act as if we are a bother to them..."}
{"text":"How did it take me so long to discover the Gypsy Bar? It's an adult arcade after-all and my kind of fun! Located behind Lucky Strike, this bar is an arcade that serves alcohol. It reminds me of a mini version of the ESPN Zone. They have a great selection of games including air hockey, skee ball, basketball, car racing, guitar hero and my favorite game of all? Group PAC Man! My only qualm with this bar is that they don't dedicate the entire bar to the arcade. It's a lot of fun and a great way to enjoy a night of cocktails through a fun activity.   We went on a Thursday night so it wasn't crowded but I also noticed a dance floor which could be fun on weekend nights. But you won't find me on the dance floor, you'll find me having PAC Man fever in the arcade. Between Gypsy Bar and Lucky Strike (not to mention Stand Up Live), this area is guaranteed fun for a night out. If you see me there, I'll challenge you to a game of air hockey!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot! I just had lunch at Gypsy Bar. I ordered their Short Rib sandwich, that made me feel like I was cheating on my man, it was so good. Service was fast and Mia (waitress) and Fernando (bartender) were excellent very friendly and helpful. I would strongly recommend going to there, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour with good food and awesome service! Great way to start a night downtown!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night for some drinks and games(we had free $5 game cards for first check in!!). They also have karaoke on Tuesdays which made for a fun night. Our bartender Mick was really attentive not to mention made a very good drink as well!! We stayed here all night long due to the amazing service and didn't even check out the neighboring bars as planned. Thanks Mick for an amazing night!!!"}
{"text":"Warm draft beer, screwed up food order plus a bar tender that over counts your total number of drinks... kind of a sucky first visit... plenty of other places in the area... will skip this place the next time..."}
{"text":"Really Guys ?? I loved this place! Was there Saturday had an amazing time! First we bowled next door had a few drinks then headed right next door great Dj a mix of good people ARCADE WAS PRETTY KOOL!!! Go Go dancers nice to look at ice breakers! drink were a little pricey but hey theres no COVER! ITS CLEAN NICE! WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR! More of a Preppy Upper Scale Bar Gay friendly! = ]"}
{"text":"This was my first weekend as a foster parent and I had multiple kiddos.  I wanted to get them out of the house and get them out of their heads and thought we would play the big jenga and connect four since we were playing th we games at home.  The manager was so accommodating and sweet with my us, and he wasn't even aware of the situation.  He was just being a nice guy and offering such great customer service - I just had to let you guys know!  He didn't have to be so kind and he seemed like that is just his style in general -he made our weekends. I know it meant a lot to the kids -thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks are extremely expensive.  Also the place smells like they used a dirty mop.  I'm Never going back."}
{"text":"Plenty of dance space but drinks are pricy. DJs are a mix bag. With the high summer heat they need to turn the AC up cause it was too hot inside last night."}
{"text":"We had so much fun there last night!  Now granted it was the Saturday before Halloween so I don't know if the crowd was the normal size and mix but we had such a great time.  There were 21 year olds up to 50 southings there for a good mix.  I can't stand it when a bar is full of the barely legal crowd.  The drinks were yummy and the bartenders were FABULOUS!  Even when I couldn't spit out what I wanted they were patient and friendly.  We danced and drank for hours and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love coming to this bar it's a beautiful place just to chill out to listen to music on a Friday or Saturday evening with your boyfriend for dinner the chicken wings are amazing will be back For more"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly service and delicious guac! Great for groups or just hanging with close friends. The close proximity to other bars/clubs makes it a great central location"}
{"text":"At first was a little skeptical of this place, however had the time of my life here with family and friends.  If your looking for a club to dance at without the guys trying to hit up on you, this is the place to be.  Very fun atmosphere and mature.  I definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"What a fun place! Dance floor, entertaining painters, and video games....something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I've been here for a Yelp event and I've been here for happy hour. This time I met up with a few folks for happy hour/dinner.  They don't really have servers that go out to the tables but the bartender was very awesome to always come out and check on us. I had the chicken spinach flatbread and that was excellent.  And the other two really enjoyed their meals as well. Is a good place to hang out and talk to friends and get caught up."}
{"text":"We came, we filled the house, we spent a lot of money on drinks and the DJ and management didn't give us the courtesy (after countless pleas) to change the music to better dance music instead of the monotonous drone of the techno crap they were playing. Very poor attention to their customers and I really have no clue what the DJ's job was other than to hold the wall up next to the computer that basically played all the crap we had to listen to."}
{"text":"Have been twice and so far, so good. I've only been on Saturdays and both times, the DJ blew my mind. He played some Big Boi and Philippians Remix of \"Runnin'\" which made my night. I get so excited over awesome music. My only issue though - it's not very crowded. :( I love to dance but when the dance floor is only half full, it's just not as fun. The gogo dancers are fantastic though. Scottsdale girls - take a note from these ladies. They tear it up! The drinks were very strong (yay alcoholism!) and the crowd is diverse. It seems so promising, but they need to draw in a larger crowd or it won't last."}
{"text":"Gypsy bar is a trendy spot located in the City Scape plaza in downtown Phoenix. It is connected to Lucky Strikes bowling alley and also has a little arcade in it. The atmosphere is fun and spacious. The various activities going on here cater to anyone and everyone. I noticed that the people there were very diverse and all appeared to be enjoying themselves. Bartenders, security and all supporting staff were very professional and friendly. The music varied from EDM, pop, top 100 hits and a little Latin music. You can purchase a drink/table package on the dance floor. There was no cover on Saturday night on the day I went. It can be a little hard to find so be aware that it is on the second floor by Starbucks and Chipotle."}
{"text":"Came here for the Phoenix NewTimes happy hour event last night. Really liked the modern vibe of the place. Cool modern artwork. Customers are able to freely walk in and out of the Lucky Strike bowling alley next door which is pretty cool. Was most impressed with the staff. The manager, named Dallas, was helping out at the bar when I arrived. I mentioned to my date how it's always nice when the bartender acknowledges your existence and doesn't just leave you hoping and wondering if you'll ever eventually be served. He struck up a conversation with us and seemed like a real cool guy. Gave us the kind of welcomed feeling that makes us want to come back."}
{"text":"Our birthday group made a quick stop here on a Saturday evening. They had happy hour specials on food and drinks. There was a strange occurrence with another patron there which landed us a round of free drinks due to the inconvenience of the scene. The appetizers were pretty good and drinks were strong. There's a lot of room for larger groups and an arcade too. It's attached to Lucky Strike Bowling Alley."}
{"text":"Way too far down the hill to bother with the bar boy or to even bother with the unprofessional staff of this place. Dallas Henderson had a better operation going on when he was the GM. Now they suck."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I feel like this place isn't sure what it wants to be... are you paired with the bowling alley? Are you a casual hang out? Are you a dance club? Are you an artistic place with drinks? Are you an arcade?   I mean, I guess it's got something for everyone really... it's just, strange. Am I supposed to dress up, or dress down? I don't know!   Is it worth checking out? Sure."}
{"text":"Okay. So let's get real here for a minute folks. All of you that call yourselves my friends that never told me this was behind Lucky Strike are dead to me. DEAD TO ME. I had to discover this due to a friend hosting karaoke there one night.  This place makes me feel sexy just walking in. Even if I was wearing sweatpants and a hoodie. Sexy! The seating is comfortable, the dance floor is large and in charge and there's a stage if you feel the need to be the center of attention, which I sometimes do. I'm a performer, what can I say.  I haven't eaten here but the drink menu is solid. Give me some whiskey and ginger concoctions and I'm game.   A game room is nearby so everyone in your group can be happy and have a good time. The skew-ball is off the hook.  With plenty of options and being connected to Lucky Strike, this place is a winner. Parking is validated and the light rail is nearby, so you have no more damn excuses."}
{"text":"Ended up here because the three other places we went to first sucked for one reason or another and this was in the vicinity.  There was a good amount of people here for a Friday night but not so packed that I felt like I needed to elbow someone in the face to get to the bar.  The music was good and the staff was friendly and quick.  My favorite part is the game room they have in the back of the club.  It's essentially a Dave & Buster's with a dance floor and better music.  I had a lot of fun and there's already been talk of making a second appearance here in the near future."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time in this place. It was kind of empty but I like it. Music was good. The place it's perfect. Pool tables. Bowling, arcade area, jenga! Lol"}
{"text":"Downtown Phoenix bar.  Old Town Scottsdale prices.  I guess that's Gypsy Bar's way of making up for not charging a cover but still validating parking.  It's half dance club, half arcade.  There are hot girls dancing on little stages and people randomly drawing artwork, but somehow this place has no personality.  If you're looking for a spot with a nightclub feel that's in the middle of a part of town that has a weak nightlife, you'll probably have a better time than I did."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I had so much fun. I loved the music,  loved watching the artists paint, it didn't take forever to get a drink,  I definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Fun places to go if you're downtown cityscape and like to dance! I like to go here after a comedy show at Stand Up live."}
{"text":"This place is just not what it use to be. I just came in for happy hour and had vouchers for penny drinks. I rarely come here but I was really excited to use the vouchers. I asked the bartender before I ordered if the vouchers were ok to use for happy hour. He told me they were actually expired (even though there is no expiration date on them). He got defensive with me when I told him that was never explained to me by the manager who gave them to me. He just shrugged his shoulders and left. I still wanted a drink! So rude. The place isn't even busy. I won't be coming back here ever again."}
{"text":"The decor of this place is awesome.  It has a video arcade which is pretty cool.  It's connected to Lucky Strike which like a hip bowling alley.  The area behind the dance floor has panels that lift up to reveal things.  On the night I went they had artists behind the panels painting pictures like some artsy peep show.  Also the staff were all wearing some pretty wild outfits on this night which made it fun.  A little pricey on the drinks, but a cool place to check out."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour with half off wells (nice pour for $3) and taps, $5 apps, and it's 4-7pm daily. Great live music Sunday evenings with a classy atmosphere-comfortable couches near the entertainment/a u shaped bar/intimate or large group tables peppered in/nice patio, grown up patrons, (except for the occasional naked hoochie, but get it girl lol) and friendly/attentive staff. Knocked off one star because you do see (little) kids wandering around from time to time as a result of this place being attached to a bowling alley/arcade. Enjoyed myself very much overall and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Great place to people watch (went on a Friday night). This place is connected to the bowling alley and tries to be a bar and a club combined into one. I don't think they did a very well job of it though."}
{"text":"This place seems like a lot of fun, but is attached to Lucky Strike so it also smells of feet throughout the entire place.   You have to walk upstairs to get to this bar, which has a dance floor, tables, and games.   We checked in on Yelp and received a $5 game card which was awesome. Sadly, the photo booth was down when we went, but I always like to highlight that there are photo booths (because what drunk girl doesn't want to take more pictures???) They had some awesome games -- Pacman which can play up to four players, giant Jenga, basketball, etc. Definitely would suggest checking in and playing a few free games!!   We were quick to be served by the bartenders, who were all extremely nice. Really nothing outstanding about their drink menu, so I ended up ordering something pretty plain, so I won't comment on the quality of their drinks.   I would definitely return, but beware of the feet smell, because it is overpowering for sure."}
{"text":"Standard drinks tasted terrible.  Bartender and manager fought with us about ordering \"well\" liquor. We were never given an option.   Would have happily  paid more for a drink that didn't taste awful.  We ordered vodka sodas and weren't given options on types of vodka  and they tasted terrible.  We ordered 2 different versions and were never offered comps and were poured the same tpye of liquor for each drink.  They wouldn't even taste what they made.    I guess that's what we get for going to a bar in a bowling alley.  Never again."}
{"text":"While in Arizona for a spring training game we stopped in here and loved it instantly. It's a causal atmosphere but also formal is that makes any sense. You can get away with wearing jeans or a dress and heals. Anyway, they have a full bar, dance floor, DJ and even access to an arcade. Also did I mention the drinks are priced VERY reasonably?! We so wish we knew of a location like this near us in LA. I recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"For my first time in Arizona this place was great good music, live artist and fire dancers good overall atmosphere it could have been better if the bar service was not so BAD. I waited about 20 minutes for a drink the bartenders kept walking pass me and my group Not Nice. After complaining to one of the guys behind the bar he quickly served us and apologized for the bad service and when I finally thought all will be well we were once again ignored and after complaining once again the guy that had originally apologized to us took my drink right out my hands and said he would not serve us BAR SERVICE WAS THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD WONT BE GOING BACK EVER !!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going there for a few years now and never have I been kicked out cause of the Rosery I was wearing!! I got asked to tuck in it and when i asked why he said cause its a federal law which i continued to ask questions and prove the guard wrong he had nothing to say but \"you have to leave now\" I didnt know it was a federal law to have my Rosery out an showing. Again I always have a good time here but that was bullshit!"}
{"text":"This memorial day weekend, let's take some time to remember great American pastimes. Baseball. Apple pie. And of course, getting sloshed at bowling alleys when you swore you'd actually bowl this time. If you're a conceited prick like me, you'll understand Brunswick is full of old people and has that trailer-park vibe. AMF is too young, and riddled with underage patrons taking shots in the parking lot (I know from experience). Like an ageist Goldilocks, I declare Gypsy Bar to have a crowd that's \"just right\".   These cocktails are expensive AF ($11), but most of them are made with top shelf liquor. I went with \"The Goose\" that had Grey Goose (duh), Grapefruit, and some other stuff I can't pronounce or care about because the first two ingredients make everything good. Skip that Tullamore Dew swill and a couple of other concoctions of plebeian swill, and you'll be just fine.  Too bad it took forever to get it out. Like, 20 minutes to order a drink, get it, and pay for it. Unacceptable, considering half the tables and a good portion of bar seating was empty.   There's so much atmosphere to enjoy, but no one is really indulging in it. There's a DJ in a very exquisite segment of the lounge, and no one was dancing, even though so many people were dressed as if they wanted to. On my way out, I had fun in the arcade, which is small, but has all the essential multiplayer games that make for fun nights out with friends. I like.   Overall, this place has some kinks to work out. \"Come here on Saturday!\" is what I keep hearing from my friends, but no way in hell should any bar in this neck of the woods only have one good day a week. For now, I'm a-ok with any establishment combining good drinks, good seating, and video games."}
{"text":"I've been here 15 minutes.  So far so good.  Got my drink promptly and my food order taken.  I checked with in on Yelp and got my $5 game card.  I will keep you updated..."}
{"text":"I went to Gypsy Bar with a large group of people with many tastes, and this bar proved to be perfect! It has a little bit of everything for everyone: arcade, dance floor, bar and an attached bowling alley with billiards (Lucky Strike). We originally planned to stay a short while, but everyone had so much fun that we ended up staying for a longer time and had a blast! I really recommend for large groups looking for a variety to please everyone!"}
{"text":"4 solid stars for making a solid Gin & Tonic, they carry Hendrick's here and for the free $5 game card upon Yelp check-in.  This place literally has it all! They have pool, corn hole, bowling, arcade games, drinks food and a dance floor.  Had a great drink for a pretty decent price and our bartender was friendly and pretty fast for turning them out. Thought the variety of things to do was fun especially since it seemed more catered towards the older crowd, however the arcade games were lacking. With a $5 game card, there wasn't much to play out of the 7 games available- some being out of order.   Atmosphere is cool except that it was pretty dead on the dance floor side, especially having a live DJ and all. Though, I suppose the lack of bodies is because I have yet to find a place in Downtown Phoenix that is busy on the weekends. Do come to DTPHX for food and drinks, if you want dancing/clubs go to Old Town."}
{"text":"They don't allow men to wear tank tops (even though it doesn't exclusively say so on their website) so don't even bother coming here if it's summer time. They don't want your money, they want you to dress properly (They think they're in Scottsdale). And there was hardly anyone in the bar. The bouncers love power trips. Lost my business forever. I used to love this bar but oh well."}
{"text":"We decided to pop in here after happy hour on a Friday night.  I saw photos on Facebook about the arcade games and such, and thought it'd be a fun way to keep the night going!  I was correct, to be sure.  The set up of the place is intriguing - it's connected to Lucky Strike bowling, but separated for some reason by a velvet rope.  I really have no idea why as we could walk back and forth - they just had some guy standing there moving the rope for us.  Gypsy bar is made up of three sections - the bar area, the dance floor, and the arcade.  The dance floor looked like any dance floor - good times if we decided to get hammered (we didn't, but maybe another time).  The bar was fine, nothing particular about it - good or bad.  The reason I'm excited about this place, though...  The arcade games!  It seems to me that the owners spent a drunken night at Dave and Busters and cherry picked the best social games from there.  Drinking and playing with your friends is a great experience.  Pac Man Battle Royal, the light touch game (you'd know it if you saw it), trivia, skee ball, pop a shot, crane games... They've got it all.  The set up is similar to D&B's, where you purchase a card with points to play the games.  Tickets get stored on the card automatically, and you can redeem for prizes at the counter (everything from candy to cool little toys and such).  I've got a couple hundred tickets on my card already, so I'll be back for more!  I've got my eyes on that Lord of the Rings PEZ collector's set...  Quick tip - Get your parking validated at the bowling shoes counter next door!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the lack of customer service at Gypsy tonight. VIP table for my birthday $400 bottle service. I couldn't get in to enjoy it."}
{"text":"I went there on a Sunday night so the place was fairly dead however the staff was great and even gave us some cards to enjoy the games for 15 minutes so that we could have fun while we hung out.  It was a great vibe and it seems like it would be a cool place to hang when there are other people around.  The animal art on the wall was a little strange but it added to the eclectic nature of this great place!"}
{"text":"Tuesday night is not the night to go to Gypsy Bar.  Friday is better. Saturday better still.  On Tuesday nights you will likely be one of five people in the audience listening to an elderly, heavy-set woman belting out a Rihanna song accompanied by a Karaoke track. You won't see artists in the mini-stages set into the walls. Neither will you see go-go dancers. Those things are reserved for the weekends.  If you go on a Friday or Saturday you'll get City Scape's closest approximation of a \"scene\"--with drink prices to match. It's not really LA yet, but it's trying."}
{"text":"This bar is attached to another bar in the cityscape area. The place was packed and it was difficult to move around anywhere. Bi didn't get to see the whole place but I did not see any places to sit only stand.  The attractive features of this place are the dance floor where you are able to work off some of those calories that you just drank and the arcade which makes you feel like a kid again.  Although the selection of games is limited."}
{"text":"I could easily give Gypsy Bar 4 stars for their Happy Hour deals from 3-7p daily, serving generous portions of quality food and drinks while offering a chill atmosphere for getting together after work.  However, when trying to organize a recent going away gathering for a coworker, I tried calling, leaving messages and even emailing via their website with no response.  Finally on the day of I finally got a live person, and they were helpful.  WHY can't they return calls or emails??   Luckily they were not busy that day and we took over a large community table available inside.  While I have only even once passed through one night I can't say I remember much or likely didn't stay very long so I can't evaluate the scene then but I can say that one this last visit my coworkers enjoyed playing a few rounds of Giant Pac-Man and skeeball ."}
{"text":"Fun spot with a big dance floor... they played all my jams from back in the day plus a good mix of today's hits. The bathroom was clean and there are plenty of stalls... brownie points for this!!!!! Nothing ruins the fun like a bunch of girls in a dirty bathroom doing the pee pee dance. The location is great and no cover charge. Minus one star because the drinks are super pricey but that's what pre gaming is for."}
{"text":"Their happy hour specials are fantastic!  I keep coming back for that alone.  Happy hour is from 4-7pm M-F, and a domestic draft was $2.    However, the last 2 times I went, the draft beers were not very cold.  I am used to ice cold beers at most bars, and the beer here was not as cold as at most other bars.  The glasses were not chilled either, though this is not a 'must'...it would have been a nice touch.  Service is hit or miss.  Sometimes it is great, and other times it is very mediocre.   Love the arcade area, and like the music as the night goes on.  Gypsy Bar: Please make sure the beers (and the glasses that you serve the beers in) are ice cold and focus more on attentive and consistent customer service.  If those improvements are made, I would give Gypsy Bar a 5.   For now, the happy hour specials are the only reason it gets a 4 instead of a 3  :)"}
{"text":"We came here when we were waiting to get in for a concert down the street. It was about 5pm when we got there and it was really slow. Much different then some of the other reviewers have said.  One cool thing is you get a 5 dollar game card with a yelp check-in, so we played some skee ball and a few other games as well."}
{"text":"Been here twice now - once on Thanksgiving Eve and this past Saturday. First time there, it was dead. Second time, it was packed and hard to walk around.  3 different rooms, bar/lounge, dance floor and game room. Cool layout, decent DJs (Kris the fist was there in November). I like the arcade games. Your typical newer, somewhat urban Phoenix bar. Not sure how the Gypsy fits into this, but whatever. I'd check it out if you're nearby but this scene is probably not for everyone."}
{"text":"I came here as a part of a friend's birthday barhop last night and I have to say it met my low expectations.   The music was all the same (unce unce unce), the wait staff was dismissive, and the cocktails were terrible. All of our drinks were way too sweet - no mint leaves could be seen in my passion mojito... was it really even a mojito then? I didn't have any food, but my friends who did seemed satisfied with it despite it taking a while to come out. The lighting was virtually nonexistent, not even in the \"setting the mood\" good kind of way - we all had to break out our phone flashlights so we could be able to read the menus.  I would've given it only one star, but I decided it earned two because of the nice $5 arcade card check-in deal. Plus, we did get a nice view of post-baseball game fireworks show. Overall, though, I can't say I'll be very eager to return for anything except for the arcade games. It's just not my kind of place."}
{"text":"Good live music!  Also, not so loud that you can't hear your companion talking.  That's a big plus in my book.  2 oz of top shelf liquor will cost you 10.50 plus tax and tip and the burgers run about $14, so I'd say this is a fairly expensive place if you just want to hang out somewhere for an evening of drinking.  For a meal and a beverage, it's got great ambiance.  Other great things are that you can play pool, they have a game room, and it;s attached to the bowling alley but farther back so you don't get the noise, so there's a lot to keep you occupied here.  I liked my visit and probably will go back.  The negatives?  The server didn't deliver  the food, so we didn't get napkins or condiments-we had to get up and go to the bar to get them, and one server had her boobs out so far it was embarrassing."}
{"text":"Location that's it.....high priced drinks, mediocre service, bad food....this place was a lot better 1 year ago. Find an alternative"}
{"text":"This place is 0 for 3 with me. The service here is terrible. It's a nice space, but they haven't quite figured out what they want to be.The fact that you can walk right in here before a downtown event while all the other establishments have long waits should tell you something. Too much competition downtown now to put up with attitude and bad service."}
{"text":"Great vibes. Salsa/Bachata/Merengue dancing every Tuesday night!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour and really amazing staff. My husband and I go about 5 days a week. A special appreciation to bartenders Mick, Dave, James and Hanaye who always make it a nice experience."}
{"text":"Both bars served terrible drinks. One didn't wash the cleaner out of the glass enough, the other didn't seem to notice the mixer was flat. If you want to tolerate awful remixes and bad drinks this may be an option. If you want a decent drink in a good (not desperate) atmosphere, stay away! Never going back again."}
{"text":"I like this as a girls night out option. Some days there will be one or two men picks but most of the time just go to dance and have a drink. Many days they have art on display and on occations have artist painting live. The games are okay and good decent. Love the music and love that it's not full of those annoying youths ."}
