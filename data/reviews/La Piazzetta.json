{"text":"Nice place among the many restaurants on Saint Catherine's. The pizza was good and the waiters were friendly. Also the price was very reasonable. Comparable to places like California Pizza in the US."}
{"text":"Fantastic place that is super easy to miss. My friends and I drove by multiple times. The red pepper olive oil on the tables is a good way to finish off pizza crust.  The staff is friendly with prompt service."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I ordered an endive salad with apples pecans and prosciutto, i don't know what the dressing was but it was very good. My partner ordered a salmon wrap of sorts, it was also very good, the wrap bread was very fresh and there was some kind of sauce in it that was good too. It came with a green relish and sour cream. 
The service however was bad. It was not that busy, no one was inside, and the patio was 80% full yet it still took over 1h for our food to arrive. The big table of 8 people next to us got their food before us even though they got there 10-15minutes after us. The waiter did not come by to ask us if we wanted drinks (we had started with water) we had to flag him down to ask for drinks and he didn't come around to let us know that our food was on it's way, which would have been nice considering we had been waiting 1h+. 
The prices are reasonable for how good the food is, but the service was bad. 
The patio we sat on was nice because we were right on St-Catherine street and got to watch the people walking by. 
Bottom line: I would recommend this if you have 2 hours to spend and want good food, otherwise I'd say to go somewhere else. 
2.5 star service/5 star food."}
{"text":"Piazzetta is small and cramped. The service was alright and the scallop and sicilian pizzas were decent although the bottoms were super burnt."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate at La Piazzetta last night and the experience was amazing. We arrived at 10:30 p.m. and the waiter said they had closed so we lamented that the hours we saw posted didn't match. We didn't try to guilt them or anything but they were generous enough to turn the ovens back on to cook up some gluten-free pizzas. So there my friend and I were at our table, with the owner and a couple waiters hanging out around the bar. At first they asked us questions about where we had seen the incorrect time posted (it was Yelp), offered us a free digestif for the confusion (which they totally didn't have to do since they were already being generous enough by even serving us), and then the owner told us that we should let ourselves feel comfortable and enjoy our evening together. The plan was **not** for a romantic evening with my friend--we were just looking for some food--but the atmosphere, the music, the delicious pizzas and desert... I couldn't help but feel romantic.

If you're looking for gluten-free pizza or if you're just want to try a romantic atmosphere with wonderful staff who **will** take care of you, try La Piazzetta."}
{"text":"I ordered a large prosciutto pizza ($30) through Just-eat.ca and a \"bottle\" of coke ($3.25 for 355ml). I'm not going to complain about getting a cold pizza as we're in the middle of a snow storm but receiving an uncut pizza that was missing toppings on half of it is insane. The pizza itself was overly salty and otherwise bland. I should have read the other reviews more carefully, what a joke."}
{"text":"Great service, great pizza, great specials, great coffee, and great dessert.  Piazetta delivered at this location, as it delivers consistently in each of their locations around Montreal, perfectly cooked pizza and fantastic service along side all the other amenities.  The only criticism I have is the beer selection is seriously lacking."}
{"text":"The food here was excellent, but it took an hour for my order to be taken, then almost another for the food to come, and yet another hour for me to get my check after finishing. The space was nice and inviting, but WOW was the service slow."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great and the service was very good! We went with our 2 little ones and they were accommodating. The food was great! We had appetizers, salads, soups and main course and everything was very good. I would come back for sure. We ordered the mojito and it was good too."}
{"text":"My friends and I were visiting from Boston and chanced upon this place while walking around in the neighborhood. This place is soo good that it really doesn't need any reviews to make it popular. Freshly baked bread, delicious pizzas, and great service. The creole pizza was the highlight of our dinner. Don't miss it. I would totally come back here during my next visit to this beautiful city."}
{"text":"Very nice pizza restaurant. I like their pizzas very much. A little pricy but the waiters are nice."}
{"text":"Service de marde! Apres avoir demander le menu des desserts, ils nous l'ont donner 45mins plustard..."}
{"text":"Délicieux!! C'est facilement un de mes restaurants favoris! La nourriture est si bonne! Il y a la possibilité aussi de demander les pizzas sans gluten."}
{"text":"Une très bonne trouvaille ! Piazzetta est une chaîne de restaurants italiens, avec des produits de qualité. Nous avons très bien mangé ! 
Les pizzas sont peut être un peu chères par rapport à leur taille mais je recommande la focaccia Méditerranée ou au saumon: un délice ! Tomates légèrement confites avec du basilic frais, avec Ca vous aurez surement mangé à votre faim ! 
En prime une bonne ambiance jazz et un service de qualité. 
En quelques mots, on y mange très bien pour un peu chère."}
{"text":"I really like this place but left disappointed . The vegetarian pizza deluxe is amazing  and the bread pudding delicious. However , the service tonight was uncomfortable , I felt like I was bothering the server . This is my third time at this restaurant but after today it will be my last . 
Food 4 stars 
Service 1 star"}
{"text":"i ordered delivery from here recently. i assumed that an $18 basic cheese pizza would have high quality ingredients, but this was not the case. there was absolutely nothing about it that could justify the price...i've had better for under $12 elsewhere, so that was disappointment #1.

#2 was their bruschetta. i HOPE it was just a mix up, but the bruschetta had parsley on it???? and no basil. so basically it was just sloppily diced tomatoes, parsley, and a negligible amount of garlic and olive oil on untoasted white bread: i.e. not something i would ever purposely order."}
{"text":"After a long day of walking and shopping in Montreal we thought we'd stop and get something to drink.Piazzetta was located on the sunny side of Saint-Denis Rue. So we decided to grab a table on the patio. It was a nice warm afternoon and the place was packed outside. Seems most people in Montreal gravitate to the sunny patios.

I ordered two beers, french canadian and a small thin criust pizza.SICILIANA 
Fresh tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, roasted peppers, grilled Italian sausages, sweet red onions and chilli flakes. The pizza was good not great, crust could of been crispier.

The beer was cold so I can't really complain. Prices seemed reasonable, and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Great friendly and professional service. However, the goat cheese pasta was terrible. Way too much vineager and not enough goat cheese. Also quite expensive."}
{"text":"We picked this place to eat after (unsuccessfully) trying to grab a table at Pizziera No 900. Unfortunately, this did not turn into one of those occasions where we miraculously discovered our new favourite dinner spot. 

Our first impressions of La Piazzetta was pretty good; the interior was decorated nicely, and the waiter was friendly and attentive when we walked in. However, after we were seated, it look about 10 minutes to get water and another 10 minutes - after signalling - to get our order placed. There were maybe three or four other tables, so I don't understand the slow service.

Food-wise, this place is nothing spectacular. We ordered a brioche for our appetizer, which was probably the best part of the meal, but it wasn't something that we couldn't recreate at home. My main course, the $17 cheese fondue stuffed pizza(?) was tasteless and small. The side salad was okay. My friend said her Margherita pizza could be found in the freezer section of Provigo. 

Honestly, if it were less expensive, this place might've fared better - but I'm not in the habit of paying $30 for a mediocre meal."}
{"text":"Sachez qu' il y a une terraces arrière qui est plus agréable en été et jusqu'à tard l automne avec ses petit foyer au gaz"}
{"text":"Great place. Not feeling up to huge New Years Dinner with friends, so I dined solo.Server and staff very friendly. Great thin crust  pizza. I had the Generosa,it comes in 3 sizes,including the Piccolo for one. Bravo 5 stars,Cafe filtre hot and strong. Thank you Philip !"}
{"text":"Maybe it was our choice of dishes but I don't see myself coming here again ... and I live about a two minute walk. 

The patio makes for a good hangout in the summer and the service is exceptional. The food however, wasn't anything to run home about. The menu is innovative, I'll give them that. We joked around and called it a 'hipster' Italian restaurant since they serve \"Italian\" food like smoked salmon pizza rolls, and cheeseburger pizza. 

We tried both these options, and our third diner had her favourite thing to order at Italian restaurants, seafood linguini. We had salads to start and I think that was the most memorable part of the meal. 

The pizza rolls seemed exotic and delicious on the menu, but once served, lacked as a dish. Was it flavourful? Yes. Did these flavours all work together? I'm still not sure. The cheeseburger pizza was reported to be okay, and our third diner became sick shortly after having her pasta. 

If we do return, it may only be for drinks on the patio."}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service (feel bad for owner)

Waiter was a lady who clearly didn't care to be there. Didn't check if we need water or anything for long of periods of time as she kept stepping out and smoking and eating.

She made a mistake in the order , (half vegetarian and half goat cheese) , she mixed up the first half. She decided to take it all back instead of leaving us with half (goat cheese ) that we ordered . She said no they will take the full pizza in the back and eat it instead. And make us a new one .  We watched the other group with us finished half their pizza by the time food came back.  

She offered free deserts for both but instead charged us for one of them. 

We asked for the bill right away, she disappeared for another smoke break. After bill eventually came , we wanted to pay right away but she went to kitchen for another 10m , so we struggled to find other people in the restaurant to help us pay and leave.

Mind you , this amazing service and the place was empty , just 2 other tables taken. 

If you are the owner and see this, save your business install cameras and change your employees as they are bankrupting your business.

Best of luck"}
{"text":"We had a quick late-afternoon bite to eat there today (we're prepping for a BIG dinner tonight but needed something light).  There was only one woman playing waitress and hostess, but service was good as there weren't too many people there.  The Pizza Germanica (duck sausage, onions, sauerkraut) was absolutely one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  They serve Boreale beer, and the stout was quite good, too.  If you need a quick bite, this is a great place.  I liked that it was decorated for the holidays, too; that made it really cozy."}
{"text":"Très grand choix de types de pizza, très savoureuses et originales.
Grand choix de vins aux verres ou à la bouteille."}

{"text":"Italian in Montreal? Oui!
Ordered Fettucine Carbonara with a Chardonnay Papillon.
Prompt service, great food, perfect paired wine."}
{"text":"My trip was interesting to say the least.  I ordered the Creole pie and my friend ordered the Seafood pizza.  The food arrived and looked amazing and did taste good for a gourmet pizza.  However upon leaving the restaurant, my friend didn't feel so well.  I am not sure if it was the pizza or if he was sick, but ended up being sick the entire night.

I'm sure the food is good, after all I had the Creole pie and was completely yummy and will return here again.  I am however reluctant to order the Seafood pizza."}
{"text":"We has a very nice dinner here. I had the gluten free pizza and my fiancé had the lasagne. Fantastic service."}
{"text":"Great pizza choices, and they have undoubtedly one of the best patios on St. Catherine.  Service was perfect - the staff was always there when we needed something but didn't bother us in our conversation.  They have a good menu, not too big or complex but informative & easy to read.  The best thing about this place, and the thing that separates them from other quality pizza places is their $12,50 meal.  For that you can choose an appetizer and a dessert.  Most of the desserts are $8 to $9 so it's a great way to have a complete dinner experience at a reasonable price.  As for the pizza, they clearly use fresh herbs & high quality cheese.  My prosciutto pizza was fabulous; I've never had a better pizza.  The ambience here is great; they have a good selection of beers on tap and it's not too loud but yet has a fun feel to it.  This is a great choice for larger parties because they have the patio available."}
{"text":"we were warned not to get pizza in montreal, so naturally we did (because we're rebels like that). i'm not really sure why we were warned away from pizza, but this place was great! it's a nice place, but not too fancy (c'mon, it's pizza). 
there was a mix of clientele the night we went- several groups of friends/colleagues, couples, a couple with a baby, and me with a teenager. 
you know those servers who can read your face and bring you what you want? yeah, our server was THAT GUY. simply outstanding. cheers to you, my friend! do servers normally make sure you like the wine before they pour a glass at a pizzeria? not generally at pizza places in my state, that's for sure. perhaps i just don't normally get a chance to visit those fine establishments. 5 stars for service!
there was a mixup in our order (probably the mumbly teen's fault) which they promptly corrected, and very well. the pistou and vegetarian pizzas were both fantastic: pretty good flavor, super thin crust, maybe could have used some more herbs and spices (but that's my preference). i did have to teach the kid to eat it with a knife and fork, as she's never seen such a strange thing. 
the kid also got a nice tiramisu at the end of dinner, which aturally i had to check for quality before i could let her have any. it was not the traditional tiramisu- no detectable ladyfingers- but still a tasty dessert. 4 stars for food.
would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Marjorie's Pizza:quel délice!"}
{"text":"Pizzas are good and creative enough to be signaled, especially the Cochonaille et Gorgonzola. The possibility to have two halves of different pizzas is also enjoyable. Quite a nice spot for an outdoor diner on St-Denis street during the summer. 

And some waiters do look Italian."}
{"text":"NE PAS commander autre chose que les pizza (qui sont bonnes). Pourquoi payer la même chose qu'une grande pizza mais pour une petite portion de pâtes...? Autant mieux aller au restaurant \"Le Planète\"."}

My girlfriend and I split the All Dressed pizza (pepperoni, black olives, green peppers, mushrooms, basil and pepper). It was about $22 but we split it so $11 each. It was filling and so delicious. Highly recommend.

Our server was delightful and bilingual.

Was a nice downtown experience"}
{"text":"We arrived in Montreal after an 8 hour car ride, tired and hungry. La Piazetta was the only restaurant within quick walking distance of our Airbnb that seemed like it had food our kids would eat, so we decided to give it a try. I'm so glad we did. It was delicious! We all loved our meals. Grown ups all got various pasta dishes, and everyone practically licked their plates clean. The pizza received rave reviews from two picky little girls. My lasagna was exceptional. The salted chocolate caramel dessert was OMG so good. The decor is fun and feels upscale without being too stuffy for kids. And the service was excellent too. Our waiter was friendly & attentive but not overbearing. This place made our first night in Montreal a success!"}
{"text":"Went with some friends during Canada day long weekend. Nice outdoor seating and staff is bilingual. Small water cups though, and I find the food too salty and too sweet.

For $22, I had:

-Potage du jour: frankly, this is the most disgusting thing i've tasted in my life. I'm fine with peas, miso and ginger. But this combination is gross. It was watery, lumpy and had no flavour. no salt or sugar for this one. I had two spoons and I left it as that.
-Gratin d'escargots camembert: although this is really flavourful, the dish was really oily, salty and a not very big. it did not come with the bread that was in the picture.
-Spugna d'érable: spongy, moist cake with syrup. on top of the sweet cake, it was sitting in a pool of more syrup.

For the food I had, I wouldn't return. It's a decent place though; the pizza looks yummy."}
{"text":"Un peu dispendieux mais la qualité des ingrédients y est. Il y a des pizzas pour tout les goûts et la pâte mince est excellente. Salle à manger fait très romantique."}
{"text":"Bon choix pour une bonne pizza a croûte mince. Il y a pas mal de choix possible de pizza. Le service est rapide et l'ambiance est décontracte."}
{"text":"The conference folks picked this place for the gay dinner. It's basically a step or two above Pizza Hut.  Waiter was nice and very cute.  They all seem to be very nice here in Montreal compared to the USA, I have to admit."}
{"text":"Incredible pizza- never had fresh Dill on a pizza before and WOW! Sangria was good, lots to look at on the patio if you like to people watch. Menu has a lot of refreshingly different options for a pizza place. The server was nice however wasn't really consistent on his service. Half of the group I went with did not speak French so we opted for English to make it easier for them and he kind of turned his nose down at the fact we spoke English- not cool! Other than that, the place is nice, and there is a lot of staff to keep things running smoothly."}
{"text":"I would pass on this place. The food is \"okay\" but you do much better in Montreal. Also, the service was simply awful: disinterested and rude waiters. We were a group of 6 and the restaurant was half-full and sufficiently staffed. We waited 20 minutes to order, and were not offered pre-dinner drinks. We then ordered a number of appetizers to share, but only received half of them. One person in our group regrettably ordered the lobster salad as an entree, it was gross.  It looked like a jar of mayo was dumped on a can of lobster meat which was then dropped on a plate of lettuce. For pizza we tried the Sicilian, it was passable but they were very cheap with the meat; spicy Italian sausage was sparingly sprinkled around the pizza. Having anticipated this, I paid for extra meat (Prosciutto), but it was never added. On the bright side, the wine was reasonably priced, and I ordered panna cotta for dessert (made in-house). The panna cotta was was incredible.  In the end, dinner for 6 was $300 (plus tip) which included 3 bottles of wine."}
{"text":"It was ok. We both ordered personal pizzas that I was excited about because it was super thin just the way I like it but the suace made it quite mushy.....so there was that. It may have been great otherwise. The Rosè Sangria was nice.....refreshing. We were able to get a seat on the terrace very quickly and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Went to the Saint-Charles location in Longueuil. Great decor and ambience. Service was fantastic, our waiter Nicolas was very attentive and knowledgeable about the wine offerings. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Une pizza à pâte fine comme on les aime!
Nous nous sommes partagés 2 grandes pizzas à 4 et une bonne bouteille de vin blanc. Le serveur nous a assuré que nous avions fait les meilleurs choix LOL il doit dire ça à tout le monde, mais il était vraiment ADORABLE! Il nous a servi les parts séparées dans chacune des assiettes et à fait le service du vin tout au long du repas. Rapide, souriant, efficace!
La végé était un peu fade et l'autre un peu trop salée peut-être, mais ça s'est bien balancé dans l'assiette. Pour ma part, j'ai trouvé que le tout manquait d'herbes de Provence. 
Soit, une qualité bien au dessus de toutes ces pizzas épaisses, grasses et inondées de fromage et de pepperonis.
Une bonne place dans le village, qui a satisfait tout le monde."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for many years now.. From their website they've been open 25 years already! Sometimes, restaurants open so long see a drop in quality but that is not the case here. 

It's a great location on Bernard street. During the summer, it's definitely worth it to eat on their small terasse!

I strongly recommend the pizza here.. Of which there are many selections. The salads are also quite nice !"}
{"text":"We came here in a Wednesday night. It was not very busy.
Our hostess was nice and efficient.
Atmosphere is relaxing, we sat at the back.
The lobster pizza was very goid., A bit weird,but good. When I bit into lobster, I can really taste it. It was made with no tomato sauce, so you can taste every bite and flavor.

We had escargot for appetizer. Apparently there was 2 in the plate.
I couldn't tell. I know I ate one. (Sorry, forgot to take a pic)

Kids meal - pasta was a bit small in portions, my 7 year old are the pasta and we had to order a cheese pizza.

Clean washrooms.

4.5 stars for food
4 stars for portion size.
5 stars for service!!"}
{"text":"Held Hostage!  So the food ordered did not arrive as we had requested, the service was so painfully slow we actually felt more sorry for the customers next to us than ourselves, and then when I was purposely to leave not tip for such a bad experience, the server told me that my 10% was not enough and that j had to leave at minimum 
15%!!!!  I am so annoyed at this location I am going back to see the manage tomorrow.  Ridiculous!  If I could post a negative star I would !  People  - if service is bad - refuse to tip!  Do not reward bad behavior!"}
{"text":"A problem with the restaurants along Sainte-Catherine rue is that they seem to fall into two categories: hole-in-the wall, mostly take-away dives aimed at drunken university students, or much more upscale restaurants populated mainly by romantic-looking couples perched at tiny tables. I was in town for a conference and a friend had had to cancel at the last minute, so I was wandering around looking for a late dinner by myself. 

Piazzetta seemed pleasantly casual in an upscale way and also did not have a wait. In the event, I was very pleasantly surprised by the food. 

The Caesar salad was a very tangy, caper-laden composition and very tasty. As the name of the restaurant implies, they specialize in delightful thing crust pizzas, some quite traditional and some more experimental. I was tempted to try the Germaniinspired special, with sauerkraut, red onions, and I believe sausage, but instead I went for the pizza Diavolo.  It was surprisingly spicy and flavorful. The crust is particularly good--quite crisp with a hint of Parmesan baked into it. They have a number of decent Italian and Californian wines by the class. 

I asked the waiter's recommendation among several very tempting dessert options and followed his guidance in ordering the Praline royale.  I am fairly picky about chocolate desserts, but this was perfect. Rather like a light chocolate mousse cake, with several layers and it crossed with a pleasantly sharp crunchy sweetness to it. Overall, it presented a satisfying chocolate richness without being cloying or overwhelming the way that some chocolate desserts can.

Definitely a fan, and would actively come back to try more of their pizzas and more of the desserts when next in Montréal. I am giving this 3 stars rather than for only because I try not to give 4 stars on a single visit."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for dinner on a Saturday night and sit on the terrace... It was full ! The server was so friendly and helpful. We ordered some Bruschettas and Pizzas. The Bruschetta chèvre was delicious with the dry tomato on the top... The Elegante Pizza was not on a Focaccia dough as we ordered, but more a traditional crust... But it was tasty and fresh.
The Spanish Syrah red wine had a strong character but it was perfect with the pizza.
The only comment is the waiting time to get your plate probably because it was so busy, but other than that, all was descent and good."}
{"text":"Sunny tables, sublime music , great food and good service...
Great for people-watching, good wine list too!
Staff very patient with me practicing my rusty Francais

Free wifi spot if you register too!"}
{"text":"My favourite thing about this restaurant is watching people mull over whether or not to snag a sample of the pizzas that sit out front. Nine times out of ten, they'll walk by with a hesitant glance. You can tell they want a piece, but what's the protocol? Is it free? Can anyone take a slice? Do I even want pizza? Life decisions, man... 

But every now and then, a brave soul will say \"fuck convention\" and go cray cray on that tray tray. I'm no sociologist, but that's the person I'd want in my corner when the going gets tough. 

As for the pizza, it's about a 6 or 7. Thin crust make you go yum, but your taste buds aren't going to explode. They do have gluten free crust though, which is why we went there in the first place. And as far as GF crust goes, this one is pretty descent."}
{"text":"Why do I come to Montreal? It used to be about the city and people, but more and more it's become the Westphalia ham pizza here. Our first day on Montreal? You'll find me on the patio here with the mushroomy goodness of this pizza. Cep sauce replaces tomatoes (porcini mushrooms for my American friends) with more mushrooms on top. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"On the Streets of Rue St Catherine- walked into a well reviewed Italian Pizzariea. We started off with  their original Sangria- rose wine. The the Dukka- Egyptian dish  (medley of spices) and fresh bread and oil. You would pull off a piece of bread - drench it in some oils and dip it to pick up the spices. Main meal we shared two types of pico pizza. Definitely reasonable to have two ppl share. We ended the meal with biscotti and chocolate cafe. Waitress was very nice and attentive. Explained the dishes well and provided time between meals- not rushed at all. We experience a few uninvited visitors off the patio- some street people- although they seemed harmless they did interrupt out meals. The staff were extremely protective and polite when turning the \"uninvited\" guests away. Did not at all taint our experience - in fact - added to the entertainment. The only thing I didn't like was that people smoked too close to the patio."}
{"text":"I like this place and tried it twice. I had a fantastic waiter the first time who made a great dry martini! I liked the pizza because the crust was perfect and they have many options for toppings. My one complaint would be hot peppers on the side when it's supposed to be ON the pizza... don't list it on the menu like that, then bring them on the side. It means I don't get that cooked in flavor they provide. 

I also tried one of their rolls! The Mexican I believe and it was pretty tasty! It is a share plate or a meal for one person. That day I ordered those and a pizza and the waiter tried to tell me it's to much food. I said \"it's ok, I plan on taking the pizza home\"... which I did. But when the food arrived, it was so much and people were laughing. I just said \"this is how Americans eat\" and we all laughed even harder... 

I also tried some wine, very nice... and a desert. The molten chocolate cake was very nice!  

I appreciated that they spoke English here and had an English menu!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Very efficient service, and very courteous server. The focaccia pizza is great, as are both the soup and salad! They also serve awesome bread rolls, piping hot from their oven (which makes for an amazing pizza experience - they know their bread (and it's delicious!)). Very trendy and stylish to boot! Their table oil is pretty good too."}
{"text":"horrible pizza and over priced

went for pizza week and we ordered the special pizza with duck and goat cheeze.the
crust was bland and overcooked.ingredients were too little. duck didnt add anything special too it.
second pizza buffalo cheeze pizza.so simple to make and they added dill and coriander which was too empowering for a pizza.

pizzas were 19 $ each before tax and tip

service was extremely slow on a monday evening and not very professional.

would never go back and don't recommend it"}
{"text":"Yum!  We had the Prosciutto pizza here and it was delicious.  Our waiter was very friendly (and attractive).  The price for a medium-sized pizza was pretty good ($13-18) and we had plenty to eat.  The prices for wine were decent as well.  This is a nice place to go for a gourmet pizza and get a lot of bang for your buck.  Also, it is decorated very funky and cool, which is fitting for the Village/Latin Quarter area of Montreal."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, on St Denis Rue, we struggled on a Monday afternoon to find a good lunch place.   We finally stumbled on this place.  I had the greek salad which was a cucumber/tomato/onion/olive salad with vinegrette, it would have been better if it had more feta and more greenery.  The caesar salad was good.

The space is interesting in that it is multi leveled and bright.  The service was great.  It was just fine for a stop in lunch.  It is a fine choice, just not one that stood out."}
{"text":"Simply excellent!!! Great service, delicious food, and the ambiance is delightful. Thumbs up to this spot!!!"}
