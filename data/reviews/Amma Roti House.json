{"text":"The food here is delicious, very reasonably priced and fresh so no complaints! The servers are very friendly and struggle a bit with taking orders but they take the time to make sure they have the correct order and ensured our water was topped off constantly and provided extra napkins without needing to be flagged down."}
{"text":"Was a big fan of this family restaurant but now they've started charging extra for rice or roti with their main courses. Sorry - better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Two stars for the good samosas but the butter chicken and chicken korma were the blandest Indian food I've ever eaten. Doubt I will go back. Better elsewhere. Too bad. Was excited to see a Roti House opening, but meh."}
{"text":"Amma is delicious, homemade style food, served with no frills and hearty portions. Instead of usual orders of naan - try the roti instead - the roti is exceptional. Fave dishes here include the goan fish curry and okra (bhindi). The portions sizes are huge so be careful how much you order!!! They also offer their dishes in a variety of heat levels, so it is great for anyone who like it from mild to extra spicy."}
{"text":"Has potential, but this new restaurant would benefit from some customer comment cards in the store. Butter chicken was dry and sauce was standard. The roti was dry too and too hot when served, made me think it has been heated in a microwave (I don't actually know if it had been). When it cooled it was crispy and rigid, not what I would expect from a roti. Price was reasonable and service was friendly but would hesitate going back until the food improved."}
{"text":"delicious Lamb Curry Rotti...unexpectedly found this gem in the Beach and will return many times over if the food remains this good! Fresh roti dough made on site...great prices!"}
{"text":"I like the idea of a fst food Indian food place.   It was ok.  Okay doesn't seem like a review of any sort but that's exactly what it was."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and the food has always been quite good but wanted to share a particular experience I had last night. I'd just gotten home from a weekend out of town and had next to no food in the house so ventured out in search of some. I decided to get butter chicken at Amma and placed my order, but then remembered that it doesn't come with rice; you have to order that separately. I was feeling very low blood sugary and tired and cranky at that point and thought, well, I'll just make rice when I get home, I'm not placing a second order.  I got my food in a few minutes and started walking home, and then noticed that there was something extra in my bag. It was a small container of rice with the words \"On the house\" written on the lid along with a smiley face. Thank you, mind-reading good fairies at Amma for boosting my mood. :) (The butter chicken was really good, too.)"}
{"text":"I truly loved the lamb vindaloo. It was one of the best I've eaten in my life! The roti was big but nothing to write home about. Wife had the chicken korma, found it a little sweet for her taste but agreed it was very flavourful. She really dug the sweet Lassi.
Definitely going to eat my way through the menu but I'm afraid nothing is going to stand up to the lamb vindaloo! I'm giving this place 5 stars for blowing my taste buds away.
I'll update my review after a few more visits!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at over 20 Indian restaurants in Toronto and this place is right up there with the best.  Very very impressed and I'm super picky with my curries.  The chicken vindaloo was excellent and the prices are very reasonable.  Friendly staff and service as well."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Quick service. Friendly waiters (we had a Nepalese woman). Reasonable prices. Had a scrumptious lunch with plenty of leftovers for dinner."}
{"text":"My family tries to stop by every Saturday, food is amazing, service is outstanding, and prices are very reasonable. 
We have a lot of food sensitivities in our family so finding an all organic restaurant is a constant quest.  This one delivers huge! 
The garage door front is open in the summer for a nice view of the park and the action on Queen Street.  And as weird as it sounds, one of the nicest bathrooms in the Beach"}
{"text":"This little restaurant recently opened up in the heart of the beach, right across from Kew Park, and thank the gods of food and beverage that it is not another coffee shop. I live in the beach, a little further west of Woodbine, and a new coffee shop just open up across from the Starbucks! Can you believe it? I sure can't! (my eyes are rolling in the back of my head btw) I saw this place over the summer and have been dying to try it as a lover of Indian food (Indian food just doesn't love me back however). It's walking distance but I took the car, just in case one of the million coffee shops along the way wouldn't let me use the washroom as curried things make their way out of me fast.
The decor in here is so cute, it's spritely green but not Leprechauny vomit inducing as some often greens are and the menu is really easy to navigate as not all Indian menus are. I chose a spring roll appetizer and a small chicken tikka masala. The dishes come in small $7.99 and large $12.99 and the small was definitely enough for moi. I took the rice but next time I'll try the roti and bring a date (do Tinder fuckboys even have the patience to eat? I think not)  so I can try more stuff from the menu. 
My chicken was fresh tasting with vegetables (!) and the sauce was nice and spicy, like I ordered. The best part was the service was stellar. The waitress was sooooo nice and kept refilling my water on cue. Also plus: my digestive system was cool with everything, a little ring of fire the next day but I get the same effect from Doritos."}
{"text":"Very nice chicken biryani. It wasn't too saucy, had some chunks of chicken breast (not thigh as I had expected) and was nicely saffron flavoured. I ordered \"mild,\" which was perfect with just a little kick. Not a romantic place to eat, but flavourful food!"}
{"text":"Ooooooh yes this is a great new neighbourhood spot. Walkable from our house, we will be going there again and again! They give a choice of spiciness level, which I appreciate. Their samosas have very good flavour and their roti are fresh, fresh, fresh!"}
{"text":"I live around the corner of this place so I decide to try,  when I entered this place service wasn't welcoming at all as it was almost end of the day \" must be tired , frustrated \" . The first question was \"what do you want? \"  . I calmly replayed \"Hi\" and left the store. Like I understand it's end of the day but come on you get paid to serve customers. Do your job properly. But even though food might be good I will never eat here."}
{"text":"I ordered lamb vindaloo and naan here, they served me readymade grocery naan, although the vindaloo was great but I was served beef instead of lamb!"}
