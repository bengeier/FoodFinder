{"text":"Excellent variety, pleasant environment, friendly service, reasonably priced. Thai dishes are excellent."}
{"text":"Probably the best restaurant we ate during our visit to Montreal. Food was amazing , service was great. We had many things from the menu and cousins complain about anything. Would def recommend and visit again in the future!"}
{"text":"When you look at the store from the outside you wonder if is a type of place that would serve quality food but dont be fooled. Food is fantastic, what we ordered was fried rice, singapore noodles, shanghai noodles, beef and brocolli and general tao chicken. All the dishes were great and full of flavours. The chilli eggplant was also tasty. The service was really friendly and the server offered us a discount if we paid cash"}
{"text":"I went to Mr. Spicy with my family and ordered from the all you can eat menu for $24.   Our soup came after 10 minutes. One of us had a strand of black hair in his soup. We decided not to say anything because you never know what restaurants do to customers that complain. Appetizers and main dishes came at the same time 40 minutes after soup, which was disappointing.  I ordered 3 more dishes because we were hungry. Waiting for almost half an hour, we thought they had forgotten our 2nd order. I asked one of the waiters and he said \"how am I supposed to to know what you ordered?\" and walked away. He could've found out for us but he just brushed us off.   So we ordered coffee and desert. I gave my order (items numbered from the menu) and the same rude waiter told me he didn't understand the numbers on the menu and to just tell him what I wanted. Coffee and desert took 5 minutes to be served and 10 minutes after, we received our 3 dishes (45 minutes from the time we ordered).  I regret going to Mr. Spicy. Ordering from the \"all you can eat\" menu is quite the scam. The service was extremely slow, it felt like they wanted to serve you slowly so you would order less. One of the 4 servers were rude. I was not impressed, food average and it wasn't not worth the money spent."}
{"text":"The food is good that's why the two stars are here. That is the only thing this place has going for it. Be prepared to wait if you have a reservation on the weekends. If you decide to do pickup be prepared to wait an additional 20-30 mins in addition to whatever time you were provided on the phone. If you ask to speak the manager ...good luck because no one shows up to explain why all the delays. The food again is good but food is good elsewhere and other restaurants actually care about their customers and the entire dinning experience. Oh and make sure you ask for a proper receipt as they magically are never prepared for any pickup order. The staff even seems surprised you are asking for it...I guess they feel fine charging the client taxes but not declaring them."}
{"text":"Awesome  dumplings and all their dishes are superior quality. I had been seeking a good Thai/Japanese delivery restaurant and this place is great. Quick delivery right to my hotel room!"}
{"text":"Très bon, service rapide et courtois. Seulement déçu qu'on as pas eu de riz/vermicelle avec nos plats, il fallait le commander 'a part'... Notre erreur, mais on a pas été prévenus par le serveur. J'y retournerais sans problèmes. Ha oui si vous êtes de petite taille, l'urinoir de la salle de bain des hommes est particullièrement très haut. Je mesure 6 pieds et je le trouvais haut. Tout y était très propre par contre."}
{"text":"Wow I was so surprised by this randomly amazing Thai food restaurant in Montreal West Island. Finally a great Asian food takeout in the area. We had the chicken curry (my least fav) the general Tao, the basil beef and sesame beef and beef with broccoli ! ! All was super flavorful, and very tasty! Twice we have gotten takeout and we will definitely be back! Really great!"}
{"text":"Went here for a UYE (unofficial Yelp event) one Friday evening at 7pm and when I pulled into the parking area, the parking area was packed so I parked close to the entrance of the parking area.  Going inside the restaurant, it was very busy and I was asked how many people. I mentioned that there was a reservation but forgot the name so I had to consult my cellphone. After consulting my cellphone, I mentioned \"Jason\" and she informed me that there wasn't a reservation for a \"Jason\" but after flipping through her book, she mentioned that there was a mix-up and they were in the other dining room area. The restaurant is divided into 2 dining areas.  I walked into the second dining area and tried to look for two of the people whom I would recognize (Kandi R. & Julia D.) and eventually saw Kandi waving at me. I sat down at the table and was introduced to D'Arcy L. and the organizer Jason M.  We were provided with the \"a la carte\" menus but decided to go for the AYCE so the server brought us the AYCE menu and we ordered items from it.  We then waited for the server to come back to us to pick up the paper where we indicated what we wanted which she left on our table. We waited and waited but the server didn't return. We then decided to bring our paper to one of the servers in the other dining room area. When we did this, our server returned and asked us how many people we are ordering for since 2 people had not arrived yet (Sarah M. and her +1)  For the soup, I opted to get hot & sour soup. I found it to be very good. Our party was evenly divided into hot & sour soup and wonton soup. It wasn't the best hot & sour soup that I've had but it was still very good. After we had our soups, Sarah and Lucas showed up. In terms of the items that we ordered which I really liked, I liked the deep fried shrimp wontons, peanut butter dumplings and the sesame beef. The orange beef was okay. I liked the General Tao chicken but most people in the table didn't seem to like it. The beef and broccoli was good as was the beef and fried noodles dish. I wasn't crazy about the pulled or shredded pork dish that we ordered nor did I really like the salted dry spare ribs.  To end off our dinner, I had a cup of coffee and green tea ice cream which were included. Kandi misunderstood and thought it was actual tea when she asked for it but didn't realize it was ice cream so I actually had 2 ice cream scoops as she didn't want the one which came for her.   :-)  Kandi ordered something take out and there was some confusion over her order where we had a good laugh about it.  We didn't manage to finish everything that we ordered but we didn't leave a lot on each plate and unlike in most AYCE restaurants, we weren't charged extra for this. It was also not mentioned on the menu that extra charges would apply for wasting food so it was good that we weren't charged extra. Another thing is that when ordering from the AYCE menu, things are not specified in terms of the number of pieces and they just give a plate of what is ordered based on the size of the table. In my opinion, this sort of encourages waste since when ordering for the second round, they basically gave us the same portions on the dish as what we ordered during the first round and some people in the table were already full or didn't want to have that item during the second round.  When paying, they brought their portable credit card machine which made it easier for us to pay. The place appears to have free WiFi. I didn't test it but saw an open/unencrypted hotspot with a name which I assume belonged to the restaurant. It is also a BYOB restaurant or bring your own wine restaurant. The cost for the AYCE dinner option on Friday was $28+tax+tip per person.  The service could be better in terms of coming to pick up our order papers. For water, they left us a pitcher which was good as we didn't have to hail the server for more water.  I give them 3.5 stars which I've rounded up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"When we got here, the parking lot was full. We were excited since we thought of this as a good sign. However we were disappointed to find out that the wait was about 30min plus. So we opted to order take out instead since we drove like 3 hrs from Quebec and we weren't in the mood to wait for a table. Unfortunately, we found ourselves disappointed and perturbed yet again when we realized that it took them an hour to get our orders ready despite ordering for take out. I was ready to give this place a 2 star however the place redeemed itself when we got a taste of their food. We recommend the eggplant with spicy sauce! A simple yet wonderful dish! The flavors exploded in our mouth. Wish we ordered two of them. So although the food took a long while, in the end, I guess it was worth it. Come during off peak times or make sure to call for reservations."}
{"text":"Very good food at reasonable prices, plus it's a BYOB.  Service is improving.  Great Hunan dumplings. A hidden gem in the West Island."}
{"text":"LET'S HAVE A CELEBRATION! HOT & SPICY LIVES A 2ND LIFE!!!  Look, I almost went into a long term depression when Hot & Spicy closed down on Decarie and almost died when the St-Martin location closed....but the head Chef moved on and opened up a smaller resto in the West Island! It's not the most ideal of places for us to get to (we're from Laval) but when it comes to quality grub, this is the place for me to get my Chinese fix.  We came here in a small group of friends and the first few things I noticed were :  - Smaller resto - It's no longer an AYCE (at least as far as I saw on their menu)  That's fine by me, if they have quality food, I don't want this 2nd chance to be wasted with AYCE. Being a smaller place makes it more economical to run and I like the more intimate environment.  Let's cover the food shall we?  Hunan Dumplings 5/5 Absolutely delicious! The sauce/dumplings really are orgasmic. Why can't I find other types of dumplings that I like this much? The highlight of the evening for me. How I missed these!  Egg/Spring Rolls 5/5 Crunchy and tasty these rolls are to die for. The sauce is just right and this sets off the evening in thr right direction with this tasty treat.  Sesame Beef 5/5 Possibly the best Sesame Beef found anywhere in the GMA. They are somewhat crunchy with a tangy flavor, but when you bite into them the flavor just melts in your mouth. It's quite therapeutic.  Garlic Beef Noodles 5/5 A plate of dry noodles gets invaded by another plate of warm beef drenched in a succulent garlic sauce which makes the dry noodles lose their dryness and get infused by a sauce made by an incredible chef. Why am I drooling?  Orange Beef 4/5 I always enjoyed orange beef, the sauce us tangy and makes it a suitable change to your taste-buds with most plates being sweet.  General Tao 2/5 Usually a main event plate but for some reason the sauce tonight was off, far too tangy and it didn't taste right. I'll need to order this again on my next visit and see if this is a permanent change to their sauce or something that will never happen again. (Exception to the norm)  All in all, excellent food with minor touches to make to provide the optimal dining experience.  Service was quick and efficient and quite friendly. A nice change from the way the slower more stoic experience I had at Hot & Spicy in the past.   Bill is acceptable, especially since if you go in a group you can order your favorite plates and split the cost.  Will be back, of course."}
{"text":"You know it's a good sign when you go to a restaurant that is in the middle of nowhere yet it is still packed.  Mr. Spicy is a BYOB Chinese restaurant located in the West Island and neighbours the airport.  You need a car to get here but it is worth the drive.    We ordered the all you can eat menu option which was about $28 and gave you the option of choosing whatever you wanted from their AYCE menu.  This particular menu offered lots of options so if you're hungry this is the way to go.  There is also an à la carte option if you are not in the mood to eat so much.  We ordered a ton of different dishes and some were excellent while others missed the mark.  My personal favourite was the sesame beef which was really crispy.  The beef and broccoli was another dish that I liked a lot.  The hot and sour soup on the other hand was a little underwhelming.  It wasn't very spicy.  I also found that the General Tao chicken could have been better.  Service here is spotty.  We had to hunt down our server every time we wanted to place an order and it took a while to get the food.  They also failed to bring a couple of the dishes that we ordered.  There is definitely room for improvement in this area.  Considering all the food we ate I feel that I definitely got my money's worth after eating here.  As a whole the meal was very enjoyable and while there were dishes that I wasn't too crazy about they would be easy to avoid because there are so many options available.  Mr. Spicy is definitely a hidden gem in the West Island."}
{"text":"This restaurant stands alone in a big lot. I dined alone and felt comfortable. It seems that they may have more hostesses than servers, so service was a bit slow, but not too much of a nuisance. I came at 6pm and they were very busy, so I highly recommend a reservation or carry out. I had the vegetable dumplings, which were very tasty and the Singapore noodles with veggies were delicious! Also, this place is byob, so don't forget to bring your wine. They provide glasses. Cheers!"}
