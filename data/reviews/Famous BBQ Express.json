{"text":"Who doesn't love BBQ? I mean, really. If you answer \"me!\" than you obviously haven't tried Famous BBQ Express on Queen. Take that!  A fan for a few years, I was first exposed to this Queen West favourite when a colleague returned from a takeout excursion with the biggest serving of food I've ever seen crammed inside a 3-compartment Styrofoam tray.  Rice? Check. Coleslaw? Check. Pasta salad? Check. Green salad? Check. A massive breast of perfectly seasoned chicken? Check. French fries? Check. Tzatziki sauce for dipping? You bet your bloody ass.  So you might have a few questions. Like, \"does it come with a defibrillator?\" No. It doesn't. Nor does it come with a couch for the food-induced coma you're bound to have if you slam all this in your gorge in one sitting. But it comes with a fork and a napkin and a smile.  The front of house always refers to his regulars as \"bro\", \"partner\" and even \"friend\" (I'm not sure what they call their female clientele, but I'm sure it's something welcoming) and always treats you as though you're ordering food from the kitchen in his own home.  Aside from the chicken dinner (described above) for about $10, they're daily specials always fill me up and offer a variety of add-ons (fries or a choice of three salads). I recommend the Chicken-on-a-Bun (special price is $5.99 and comes with a side), and although I haven't tried it myself, will recommend the bulgogi based purely on the fact that everyone I know who's tried it SWEARS by it!  Overall, great value. And if, after eating here, you're still not a fan of BBQ, I don't know what else to say but, \"I need to revoke your citizenship\"."}
{"text":"I finally tried BBQ Express! Always walked by the place but never really got the chance try it.   When I stepped into the joint, I was greeted by a cute little Korean woman, she was so adorable and happy which brought a little brightness to the place. I stepped up to the front counter and order the BBQ Double Leg Dinner. It was wonderfully seasoned and served with crispy fries, coleslaw and salad (they also have rice and pasta but I changed it to extra helpings of coleslaw which they did not mind at all). It was quite delicious and only came up to about $10 with a can of pop. The portions are really big and they give you soo much food per serving - its definetly pretty awesome if you're a student on a budget."}
{"text":"I visited this place after reading raving reviews here. I ordered the spicy pork and spicy souvlaki. The souvlaki was stir fried with hot sauce??!!!! And the pork's sauce was horrible. I can tell ya.. It's full of MSG.   ... Felt thirsty like hell after the meal.  Pls tell me that the owner/ cook was different when the reviews were posted."}
{"text":"I tried out Famous BBQ for a quick dinner tonight and found the food to be quite alright, portions agreeable, and staff very friendly. It wasn't bad, but it was just fast food.  I ordered the chicken bulgogi special which came with a bed of rice, side of cold pasta (good!), coleslaw, and a regular green salad with your choice of bottled dressing.  The feature of the dish (the chicken bulgogi) had many pieces of red onion, and very little chicken in comparison. You get your fill more on their steamed rice and pasta (which is cold and lightly seasoned), than you do on their main. The chicken is perhaps slightly oversauced, depending on your preference.  Given the wide range of fast food options available in the city, I would not likely return or recommend this place to anyone who isn't looking for just a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Best food on Queen street! Cheap price plus free smile, love it! I just found out that they moved to 361 Yonge street. For the grand opening, they have $5 a meal for daily special. BINGO!"}
{"text":"SUPER tasty, amazing quality, and at a bargain.  You won't believe how much of the main meat (recommend the bulgogi, or double chicken legs), fries, coleslaw, and veggies you'll get. Right now all mains are only $5 too.   Give it a try, you'll be hooked, I definitely am... the Korean couple who own it couldn't be sweeter too."}
{"text":"Spicy chicken on a bun is yumm as it is and when the person behind the counters asks you politely \"Do you want a combo - fries or salad? Its only 50 cents more\" - It makes such a strong argument that you have to buy the combo.  The sandwich is awesome - so awesome that people ate my lunch and want to go there tmrw for lunch. Worth a try"}
{"text":"Yet another place close to work that i come to so regularly the owner thinks something is wrong if he doesnt see me, lol! Want great, friendly service...this is it baby! I was in shock when I seen how huge the portions are for that price. the coleslaw and pasta sauce are amazing as is the spicy pork. The owners are incredibly friendly. If your not sure what to get, just ask and they will hook you up! I highly recommend this place, check it out anytime your in the area, you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! For 10 bucks you get a heaping supply of rice, fries, coleslaw, pasta salad, salad and beef, chicken or whatever you ordered your main to be. They also have new customer loyalty stamp cards, so for every 8 or 10 stamps you get a free meal and I know it might not mean much to you but when you love this place as much as I do - its amazing. AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"The barrel chested man is long gone, replaced by a very sweet husband and wife team. I'm now on my 2nd \"loyalty\" card. I prefer to call it my \"royalty\" card. Sometimes they're generous with the stamps. That's nice.   MENU RECOMMENDATIONS Hot Roast Beef Sandwich - I was expecting an open faced, gravy smothered pile instead I got a hot roast beef club sandwich! Oh the heat from the meat melts the layers of bread away and it becomes an incredibly delicious, incredibly eatable sandwich. Not the best roast beef but definitely a warm-you-up, make-you-feel-good kind of thing*.   *no guarantees it'll make you feel as good as Billy Bob did Halle though"}
{"text":"Famous BBQ Express: Cheap and cheerful on Queen Street!  I was doing some holiday shopping and I wanted some warm comfort food.  Nothing says comfort like BBQ!  I stepped inside and the owner was super friendly and chatty. I decided to get the spicy pulled pork pita with a salad. ($6.50)  The dinners are a great value!  I sort of wish I got a dinner with the pasta salad and coleslaw.  The salad is just lettuce and dressing.  A lot of patrons were ordering the spicy pork or bulgolgi dinners.  However, my pita was really yummy. The pulled pork was super soft and not your traditional pulled pork. It wasn't saucy at all but it was still juicy and deliciously spiced. The pita bread was much thinner than expected and toasty.  I'll be back for sure if I'm in the area again and I want some BBQ! =)"}
{"text":"The service is impeccable. And the best thing (if not the only thing on the menu worth ordering, and I mean that in a good way since it's so good) is the BBQ spicy pork. Make sure to get it with their amazing crispy fries, even if it's on the BBQ spicy pork sale day (on which you get no fries unless you pay regular price). HUGE portion for the hungry man. Like me!"}
{"text":"OH SNAP!!  $10 can get you THIS MUCH FOOD?  Well, Michael Pollan (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWg0cCNAB-M) probably wouldn't call it \"FOOD\" per se ... but it's tasty, and it's guaranteed to fill you up.  Not the most healthy, not the most green-friendly spot either (styrofoam? wonh wonh!), but if you're on Queen West and you're hungry, Famous BBQ Express is a pretty awesome option.  Souvlaki, burgers and the only menu option that I've actually tried - the bulgogi, it's all there.  The bulgogi is extremely tasty, comes with a few sides and is full of flavour.  Although it doesn't ACTUALLY taste like authentic bulgogi (Korea-town, whattup!) it's still a great meal at the end of the day.  Let's call a spade a spade.  This is like a step-up from traditional fast food.  A more well-rounded meal (fries ANNNND a decent sized salad -- beat that Licks'!!), includes some Canadian-inflicted global menu options, and Famous BBQ Express definitely boasts bigger portions than most.  All that, and you're in and out in 20 minutes flat.  So long as you take it for what it is, you'll be satisfied, and you'll probably high-five the Korean homie who runs the joint (he's super nice and rounds the 3.75 stars up to an even 4) on your way out."}
{"text":"I didn't eat but my brother had his usual and it was great!!!"}
{"text":"ok why haven't I been going to this place all these years?   any kind of meat you get tastes awesome! and I don't think anyone else can beat the price for that much food, seriously find someone to share with!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place on my lunch hour when I worked downtown. Its kinda of like a fast korean takeaway...I would usually order the Bulgogi as that was recommended by the owner.   The order would come with fries,salad,pasta salad, and rice. It's a massive serving for under $10.  Very well done and nice people too."}
{"text":"If you want alot of food for a great price, Famous BBQ is the place to go. But make sure you go to the one on Queen St, there are other imitation Famous BBQ's around the GTA but they are nothing compared to the original.  When you arrive at the place you will most likely be greeted by Dave, for he is the owner of Famous BBQ. There is a reasonable amount of items to order, from burgers, chicken and pork either spicy or non-spicy, to a rack of ribs, and wings. Besides the meat it all comes with pasta salad, rice, green salad, coleslaw, and fries more than enough to make you full. For those of you that don't know what to order all you have to do is ask Dave and he will definetly recommend something that you won't regret.  Fair warning for all those who go there for lunch especially during the weekdays, it is ridiculously busy to a point where the line up is out the door.   All in all amazing food and a very friendly service.   Items to definetly try:  -  Spicy chicken -  Spicy pork -  Bulgogi"}
{"text":"I live in downtown Toronto for many years now & am always on the lookout for a great meal. Famous BBQ Express recently caught my eye & I just got to say that I was very impressed with the variety, taste, & low price of the food from this fast food restaurant.      TRY THE BEEF BULGOGI !  Oh boy - the Famous BBQ Express Beef Bulgogi was sooo gooood! I got it as a special meal for 7.50 with fries, rice, salad & noodles. All the sides tasted good as well, but the beef was without a doubt the best. The sauce / spice they use for the Bulgogi gives the beef this sweet & deliciously addicting taste that one just can't get enough of.  Some other discoveries I've made about the place:  - the fries tasted really good as well. Nice & crispy. They looked like they might have come from a frozen bag, but that did not distract me from enjoying some delicious fries.  - The meals are huge, & are a great bang for your buck. There are even daily specials which are only $5 !  - As already mentioned, the meals come with a great variety of food types for you to choose from (noodles, rice, salad, fries, meat). Not many places offer so many sides in one meal.  But yeah - all in all, Famous BBQ Express, small as it is, has a lot of great food to offer & is an ideal lunch &/or dinner destination for people with good taste & not too much money to spend. I can only recommend that you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Meals here come with salad, fries, white rice, and your choice of meat. My favourite is the bulgogi - sliced beef with a sweet and savory sauce. There's a different special everyday and they always have a single leg meal for $6.50. Workers here are very friendly and will remember your face if you come by often. Buy 10 get one for free!!! Expect a lineup during lunch time."}
