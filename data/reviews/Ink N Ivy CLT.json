{"text":"Good atmosphere nice servers decent food.  However, I ordered a dozen blue point raw oysters. When they came out, I knew immediately they were gulf oysters not blue points . But I thought that's ok, it's loud maybe my server didn't hear me.  Once I got my check I realized she did hear.  Not her fault, maybe it was a mixup, but I kinda don't think so.  

To you no. Oyster eaters, that would be like ordering a filet and they bring you a tied up sirloin and charger you a filet price.

Update:  the manager of this location contacted me and apologized.  Very nice gesture, so I bumped then up another star."}
{"text":"On May 15th 2017 they were issued a sanitation score of 83%. For those unaware that is considered a B by the North Carolina state board of health and safety. After reviewing their preverbial \"report card\" I read that they were \"dinged\" for common sense things like improper hand washing and chefs not properly covering their hair and beards and also leaving their personal car keys and belongings near food prep areas. I wish I could say this is small stuff, but this is often times how norovirus and other food contaminated illnesses spread. Soooo chew on that for a moment.

As for the look and feel of the establishment. I will echo what many others have said...it's trendy, young and in my personal experience...all three times that I have been here the wait staff has been courteous, maybe not prompt.... but courteous. Anytime after 9 PM on weekends gets a little loud and has the feel of a club. There's even a velvet rope outside with a line waiting to get in. Music is loud, crowd is young...food is suspect. Oh yeah and  the last few times I was there, they ran outta simple, yet key ingredients to make the most basic cocktails. I wouldn't say not to go, since everyone talks about this place, but I also say don't have high expectations. Enter at your own risk and please for the love of God, PLEASE don't take your date here...it's not exactly a quiet date night kinda place.

{"text":"Awesome environment, great food but AMAZING costumer service. Thanks to our server Stefany!"}
{"text":"The decoration and atmosphere is fantastic. LOVE the murals. Had the jalapeño fried cheese, it was good, didn't care for the sauce. I also ordered the steak salad and it was good as well. I had two drinks. The Gentlemen's choice was watered down and didn't taste anything like blackberries. I asked the bartender for a French 75 and she had to look it up on her phone. She also put it in a wine glass with a lemon wedge and a cherry which was disturbing. Tasted awful. Would go back and try some different menu items. Wouldn't count on a good drink unless it was a beer or something very simple."}
{"text":"The only reason this review gets one star is because the wine was good and 1/2 price and the bartenders were able to actually fulfill an order. 'Surly' would be a good descriptor but in comparison to our server, who was probably high, they were little angels. 
Our food order was never put in. Our second order of wine was spilled on the floor - only to not be mopped up by anyone. I mean, I would have been able to find a mop and clean it up faster than the employees. And - I doubt anyone would have noticed a customer looking around in closets for a mop because NO ONE seemed to be looking after the place as a whole. 
When I brought this to the attention of the host, I was told that we could leave if we wanted and sorry about what happened. But I'm hungry and sober. Seems like the opposite of how a bar/restaurant wants their patrons to leave.
Shocking.
Avoid this place like the plague unless you want to risk red wine spilled over you followed with a side order of hunger."}
{"text":"I went to Ink N Ivy for the first time after reading some mixed reviews. I got the porkbelly sliders to start and the buffalo chicken sandwhich. The food was pretty good but the signature cocktails were great. The best thing about my experience was  my server McKinley. She was attentive, friendly, and genuinely seemed like her first priority was making sure I had a great experience.  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the first time I went was a pretty good experience, and the decor is cool, but then again I just had drinks...I should just do 1 1/2 star. The first time I was here, I came with a group to watch the Panthers vs. Cardinals game, we were sat right away and our server quickly came over and was very friendly. I dont think they were offically suppose to be open that day so it was a nice change to watch the game from the EpiCenter. The place became packed quickly, and we could tell, our server was hard to catch at times, but i've been a server, so no worries I know what its like when your slammed and they were only serving drinks. There was a station set up out on the patio for snack like food, but the kitchen wasnt open?!?!  The beer selection was great, enjoyed several Jam Session (my fave local brew). 
That was then...flash foward to New Years Day 2017.  A group of 5 of us met for dinner, again got sat right away. Most of us orderd drinks, I decided to try the Captain Mule, figuring it was similar to the Moscow Mule, our server Chazz (yes, Chazz with 2 Z's...cue in Will Ferrell--Blades of Glory) asked me if I knew it had Captain Morgans in instead of Vodka, yes, thank you Captain Obvious! So you know the signature copper mug right? No, he brought it out in a pint glass and said \" We don't  have any copper mugs, sorry\" the glass felt like it was just out if the dishwasher and needless to say the ice melted quickly and my drink was watered down. Total fail! Thats the best part of the drink! Another girl at our tabke ordered a cocktail that had Jameson in it, which shockingly the had ran out of Jameson, so her back up drink was suppose to have a lime taste, she had to ask for limes. 
When our food came out, the fries were so cold we asked for fresh fries, I had the Po' Boy, it was average. A friend of mine ordered the Chicken Ivy and barely touched it, it too was cold snd didn't taste right she said....nothing worse than bad tasting chicken. I dont think anyones food was hot like it should be, warm at best. We've all been servers and HATE complaining but we were so disappointed with this place, I highly doubt we will return, sadly not even for drinks if they cant make their signature drinks well. We had high expectations and they all failed. It was 6:30 when we met for dinner and it was so loud we felt like we were in a club and had to scream at each other to talk, our server aka Chazz the Spazz was all over the place and seemed lost at times. Maybe this place turns around. They have a long way to go. Oh, and lastly I commented on their Instagram page about this today and it was deleted...hopefully this will stay!"}
{"text":"This place is the absolute worst! It blares music at 1 am on a Thursday in a residential area. When confronted the managers are absolutely rude. Hands down worst customer service"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Bartenders eating behind the bar with empty drinks in front of guests. Prices are all over the place. The only good thing about this place is the location."}
{"text":"Food has been amazing so far. Great atmosphere and TVs. Can't wait to try more of the menu. Huge win for the BC group"}
{"text":"Interesting looking place and nice atmosphere.  The food is average.  I had the signature salmon salad.  The salmon wasn't rare as requested, and it was flavorless.  My co- worker had the ribs, again flavorless; and, a Margherita, which at this place isn't the classic, but has oj in it."}
{"text":"I went to ink and ivy during their soft opening and was very excited for this restaurant bar. The atmosphere is a lot of fun. We decided to try their brunch today and all I can say is it was a disappointment. I got the eggs Benedict and grits. I did not think this was a hard brunch item. When I got the dish the eggs were fried hard and the grits had the consistency of rice. We told the waitress and she promptly sent it back for real eggs Benedict and better grits. What I got back could have been worse. I got eggs that were over easy and grits that resembled rice. I didn't send this back because it was obvious that this restaurant did not know how to do such a simple breakfast item. We did have great wait staff and the drink specials are excellent. If you are going for a good meal look somewhere else, but if you want some good drinks then I'd say give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is always super packed and there is normally a wait. Me and friends thought it would have to be good then...we were wrong.

Service isn't bad nor is it the best in the world. The waitress didn't seem to want to talk to us.

Atmosphere is a little strange. The place is like half sports bar, half finer dining. A cool location tho.

Me and the wife got the Chief's Seafood Platter. Our friends food got there first after a few minutes the manager came over and told us he was sorry and his top chief was working on it. 

From that interaction, we believe the server either forgot or the other went to a table that ordered the same dish after us. It's a huge dish that is $100. Hard to forget about something like that.

The manager offered to bring us something to munch on like fries. I completely understand the gesture, but no, I want the food I ordered. That may make me sound like a jerk, but when you spend $100 on food, you kinda wanna eat that food in a timely manner. 

The food itself was a 3/5. Not enough actual food but what was there was good enough."}
{"text":"Shitty shitty shitty. Rude wait staff. The hostess had no clue. About anything. No help. No service. I left. I will tell everyone I know that this place sucks balls. What a joke."}
{"text":"I enjoy seeing the new restaurants that are being opened due to the growth of Uptown Charlotte.  This is a nice addition that has a personality of its own.  The service was ok and I liked the spin on the mozzarella stick.  I also enjoyed one of their cocktails. 

My rating of a two is because during the lunch hour there were these flashing lights in the restaurant.  Totally distracting and if I had a vertigo issue I would need to leave.  The lights also flickered throughout the dining area a few times.  This may just be due to construction in the area.  Either way it was annoying."}
{"text":"Great cocktails! Waitress was very attentive and food and drinks came out quickly. The Firestorm cocktail was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Dear Charlotte, 

If you're looking for a place to get dinner and drinks with friends at ink and Ivy (particularly on a Tuesday) DON'T.  We went here last Tuesday and we are still waiting on our food. Our server was MIA for 45 minute increments. We managed to get our appetizers 50 minutes after we ordered them. The nachos were good, so congrats to them on that, I guess. Overall we were less than impressed and have ZERO intentions of going back."}
{"text":"We went to this fun place last night.  The restaurant we were planning to go to was closed for the holidays so we just found this place on Yelp as a Plan B. And, I'm so glad we did!  The food, atmosphere (inside and out!!) and service was outstanding!  We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I have gone to this place several times. Food is usually pretty good. However service is consistently horrible.  Staff is not well trained, they consistently understaffed. The bar area reeks!!! Great location, Good food, Good bartenders, Terrible food servers, Bar smells horrible.... 2/5 for me."}
{"text":"It seemed obvious that you don't get service if you are over the age of 25. We did not get seated outside despite MANY empty tables. I told the hostess we would just take a booth inside and were seated and given menus. She advised the servers. We sat there approximately 25 minutes. No one came by to take our order so we left."}
{"text":"This place literally sucks. We've been twice, the first time we got a table and the food was horrible. The Jambalaya pasta and steak were pathetic. 2nd time we've been waiting for 3hrs for a table. The hostesses keep assuring us we'll get one eventually. It's now 10pm and we've run out of patience. Eat here at your own risk."}
{"text":"Want to love this place. Decor is cool and outdoor patio awesome. Too bad the service is awful and food mediocre.  This was the second time we have been there. The experience was so bad it would take days to explain. The only good thing that came out of the two hour debacle was that the manager ended up at least reducing our overall bill.   Honestly when your server disappears for so long that you have to go to the bar to order a drink and ask the hostess if she clocked out and didn't tell anyone because she was literally nowhere to be seen that is not a good sign. The other people in our group said they have experienced this bad service each time they have been there. I heard they are opening in Charleston.  Perhaps they should fix what they have before trying to expand any further."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Ive never had such a great service for drinks and atmosphere. Its walking distance from the knights stadium. The security at the door is really great. They have a woman security guard who is always smiling and looks like she enjoys her work. The security team is well dressed and the waiters are always pleasent. The drinks are really good for the money. All in all a wonderful place to eat."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for our food and finally left because we got tired of waiting.

It said my review was too short. Don't know what else I can't write so... words words words words words words words words."}
{"text":"First of all let me start by saying this establishment seems more and more unorganized everything single time I go there. The food is over priced and alway seems to take forever to be made.
I'm not saying things should be rushed but 45 minutes for crab cakes is a bit much. And the service is subpar to say the least. I did have one server that was great but other than that it's a joke. They have a bar manager is that more concerned with hitting on girls than helping the staff. Which brings me to my next point. the bar staff does not seemed to be properly trained to handle high volume. I have been here 5 times and every single time the bar is a disaster. I decided to write this review after my girlfriend and I were told it would be a hour wait to sit down on Friday night when there were tons of available seating."}
{"text":"Really let down by this new spot in Uptown. First impression: decor was neat and different, made it seem like a fun atmosphere.  It wasn't too crowded for only being a month old, but we waited about 10 minutes for a table for 2.  We noticed they had a raw bar and we decided to order steamed shrimp to start and it was very disappointing. No flavor and overcooked but we gave them the benefit of the doubt, maybe a bad batch.  We ordered the shrimp and grits which was alright at best, seasoning was pretty good,  but the plate was just \"alright\" (other than the bread that came with the order which seemed almost 2 weeks too stale).  My order was the 1/2 chicken plate and it may of been the worst chicken I've ever had...and that's a big claim.  It was so dry, you couldn't swallow the meat without water and the flavor was so plain, cardboard may have had a little better taste. We actually had to take some seasoning from shrimp and grits to put on the chicken to make it some what edible.  The small waffle that came along with the plate was burnt to a crisp, the fries seemed like frozen grocery store fries.  The only decent part of the plate was the beans and Cole slaw, which weren't the best I've ever had, but helped the cause of the meal.  I'm not one to complain about food to the waitress's or at restaurant so we powered through our meal and left with a smile.  No complaints about the service, very nice people; the decor and the prices were really great, but based on our dinner, it would be hard to get me to come back here."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, cannot give this place a good review or recommendations. Location and decor are great. Saturday, Dec 10 walked and asked for a table for two with estimated 15 min wait, no problem. Got a drink at the bar but 45 min later still no text regarding our table. Spoke to one of the many inefficacious hostess there and clearly they forgot to text us instead of an apology they said we were just about to call you about open seats at the raw bar(they had been open the whole time) after refusing they said then it will be a 45 min wait so that would have been a total of an 1 hr 30 waiT. Clearly we left. Poor customer service and lack of basic apology for clearly an error on there part. Plenty of other uptown restaurants to patron."}
{"text":"Bar cocktails were ok. Sat outside which was nice. Ordered dozen oysters ($32) and specified not humongous ones...half of them were massive.....still charged $32 and didn't eat half of them :((("}
{"text":"Don't remember much since we had just left the game but this place is GREAT for a fun drink before or after a game (and probably all the time but I can't judge). Awesome patio, fun bartenders and lots of drinks! Playing good music, Tvs on, fun diverse crowd, nice view"}
{"text":"Came in for the lunch special Fish and chips....fish were soggy,  the chips were non-crispy home fries. The plates were not consistent,  my guess had a full piece of fish and i had broken pieces,  no drink refills. I have been here before, with great service.  It is hit or miss with the service and guality of food."}
{"text":"Went there for a Panther game.  Literally 40 guys for every girl. The waitress was actually very punctual and came by our table very often and replaced our over priced drinks quite often.  Me and my buddies enjoyed the game, but could have done it at home a lot cheaper.  The bar was under served with too few bar tenders. 

Probably a much different experience than on a Panther game night, so your YMMV."}
{"text":"Would have liked the Truth Serum to have a little more jalapeño kick and would have liked to try the Firestorm. Shame they were out, but that must mean it is a popular drink, hopefully. So far have not found a \"jalapeño draynk\" to dethrone the Akuma."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cool atmosphere in a great location, this place is it.  If you're looking for great food, reasonable prices, and great service...avoid.  If I've had a bad experience somewhere, I will typically return a few times and try to give the benefit of the doubt. Maybe someone was having a bad day, or the cook's game was slightly off.  I've been here FIVE times.  EVERY time the service has been absolutely TERRIBLE.  The hostesses were the worst.  They were rude and had absolutely no idea what they were doing. Overall, staff (aside from one waiter on one of my visits) was miserable and rude.  The food was terrible 4 out of the 5 times.  And the mediocre drinks were heavily overpriced, which I would be ok with given the location of the restaurant...however, I expect quality, friendly service with those prices.  Again, expensive drinks on a Friday night to party uptown with 20 somethings...this is your spot! A quality meal experience, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The shrimp tacos as appetizer are to die for! This place is awesome, it can get crowded on weekends though so make a reservation or sit at the bar!"}
{"text":"Overall 3 stars. We went on a Wednesday night for a friend's dinner. The place had a good crowd, but the majority of it was at the bar, certainly not overly busy. The best thing about this place was by far the atmosphere - the decor is fun and eclectic and the patio is huge.  If not for the environment this would have been a 2 star review. 

Service: Our waiter was very nice but not very aware of our table space. We had collected a pretty hilarious amount of cocktail glasses at the end of the table which were not picked up until the very end of dinner. Additionally, our oyster plate took up the majority of our area and was there about 30 minutes longer than it should have been. 

Food: Ink N Ivy seems to be a better place for bar-style appetizers than for sit down dinner. We started with the mussels which were the first disappointment for the evening, being overly cooked and served with stale bread. The curry sauce served with it was good, but didn't compensate for the mushy mussels. We ordered the nachos which had large slices of jalapeños and were my highlight from the menu. 

For entrees, our table ordered the pasta jambalaya, chicken sandwich, maple glazed salmon, and grilled scallops. Reportedly, the chicken sandwich was good, but the jambalaya was a huge disappointment. The salmon and scallops were on par with the mussels - flavored well, but severely over cooked. The scallops had a rubbery texture and the salmon was dried out. Very disappointing for a meal that had so much potential."}
{"text":"Update: food was not that great and service was lost. My brother ordered a medium well burger and got medium rare. I had the shrimp and grits and they were average"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on Friday to have a drink before dinner and a show. 

Absolutely amazing space. I can't wait till the warm weather to kick in cause this will definitely be a hang out spot! There is a ton of seating inside with a very large bar and raw bar. The decor inside was very modern and nicely done.

I ordered the Gentlemen's Choice mixed drink and my husband a beer. Unfortunately my drink fell a bit flat. Just tastes like watered down whiskey. No berry flavoring what so ever. 

We walked outside and fell in love with the outdoor patio! Super cool seating options. Plus the views overlooking Romare Bearden were stellar! Ended up playing a game of ping pong as well.

Excellent patio space!"}
{"text":"Everything started off great for a date night, we got seated immediately and ordered drinks. Both of our drinks came out fairly quickly, we ordered the maple salmon and crab cakes. 45 minutes go by and yet no food, the manager comes out and explains that he didn't like the way the salmon looked and it wasn't presentable (which we completely appreciated) so he said it would take \"a few more minutes\". 25 minutes go by the manger comes back out stating that it's his fault and he forgot to put in a new order... needless to say the crab cakes had not come out yet. 

After waiting a total of an hour and 20 minutes the food finally comes out- the salmon was dry and over cooked, the grits were cold, dry and hard as they'ed been waiting for an hour and 20 minutes until the salmon was cooked. The crab cakes were very small but tasted okay. 

The manager apologized for the delay- sensed our frustration and comped our meal. Unfortunately, this will be the first and last time we come to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went when it looked like they were having a large group / after party there. I was excited to finally try this place, and we asked to be seated close to the bar. We had to walk up to the bar to get drinks, and after waiting over 20 minutes for a waiter to greet us we left and ate elsewhere. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"+ Unique atmosphere inside, lots to look at, many TVs so good for watching a game
+ Great bloody mary bar ($4) and $2 mimosas
+ Awesome outdoor patio, great location
+ Food wasn't too expensive
+ Lots of good looking stuff on the menu

- Service wasn't too friendly
- Omelet was small and basic, not very good
- Grits were bad

Seems like they are still working out some kinks. I would come back but not for a full meal."}
{"text":"Literally the worst place I've experienced as  is e kkas a newcomer to comer to Charlotte! Went to the bathroom and they cleared my drink. Overpriced, bad crowd, and the bouncers make you feel you like an outsider if you don't know them or pay them off"}
{"text":"The patio vibe is awesome. We visited for Sunday brunch. It was pretty crowded both inside and out. We sat outside with a short wait. 

We were greeted and given drinks promptly by our server, Emili, whom we adored. The $4 Bloody Mary bar was full of variety in both mixers and additions. The $4 double mimosa might give it a run for its money. 

I contemplated ordering the smoked chicken salad wrap or the steak salad. They were out of the wrap, so I went with the salad. I ordered my steak medium but it came out well done. It tasted fine, so I did not send it back. The flavor was good, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations. Nothing special. The buffalo chicken sandwich my hubby ordered was a huge portion, cooked well, and was very tasty. I ordered a side of fries with my salad. The brunch menu side of fries is $3 while the lunch menu side is $5. We were charged $5, but they fixed it to $3. Apparently, one of the menus need to be updated. 

There are multiple $6 parking decks around, with immediate parking beside the building for $8. We were lucky to find a parallel spot right in front of Romare Bearden for free. From what we've heard, they don't validate for parking costs. 

Overall, we will be back for the cool vibes, drink specials, and the hip crowd. Especially when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend to have a good time out. We were having a blast until 2:00 when we were told that we were able to stay and enjoy the rest of our drinks until 2:30 by our great sever zack. However, we were rudely approached by Colin anoher team member that said we need to kick you out. The audacity of someone who promised us 15 min and told us to leave at 2:13. And to chuckle and say it too. If you ask me that's an asshole move. Byeee not a place I want to come to at all. Awful service!!! And now another coworker was being rude and his name Jonathan!!!! Telling us he is trying to be nice. I hope you keep your severs in check. I worked in the restaurant industry for 10 years and the audacity of these servers!!!"}
{"text":"The food is tasty and the decor is trendy. I met a friend here for an early dinner. It was her suggestion and I'm glad I agreed to go. We ate just before the after work crowd arrived. The atmosphere was great. I ordered the house salad and chicken quesadilla. The food was seasoned well. And the wait staff attentive. I'll definitely go back for happy hour to try their cocktails and sit on the open patio."}
{"text":"I was incredibly disappointed. There was barely anyone in the restaurant and we had to wait 10 minutes for a host to greet us. Once we were seated, we waited 15 minutes for a server and eventually left. Horrible service."}
{"text":"We went for cocktails and oysters on Sat 11/26. Signature cocktails were $$ but were weak and sweet. We ordered raw bar oysters as an app and then salads. Salads came out first. Oysters came out 20 minutes later and only a 1/2 dozen and were then informed that they were out of them. If I were to go again, I would order beer only, skip the food, and stay out on the patio, which is by far its best feature."}
{"text":"Brad, the service just really turned me away from this venue. They waiter gave my friend half of a drink and did not see an issue with it. We couldn't find the server, so we went to the bartender to complain. The bartender fixed the problem but then told a long winded story about how now the bar has to pay for the drink instead of the server and she was frustrated about it. Then then server marches over and is livid that we talked to the bartender. He was telling us that we were wrong. I'm sorry but how dare you.. were the guest. Try that customer service one more time buddy. Not at all happy about this experience."}
{"text":"The food was above average. I went for lunch on a Saturday. It was very busy and the wait was 30 minutes. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich, which was tasty. But it was just smothered in the white BBQ sauce, causing my bun to become mushy. Very limited menu, and we were told they don't have onion \"on the line\" (to put on a burger), weird. The environment is LOUD, And i could not have a conversation with my table. Also one of their toilets was clogged and overflowed with something nasty, and not attended to."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary bar on Sunday's is amazing, atmosphere is great too. Unfortunately the food needs some work, it was the worst eggs benedict I've ever had and the rest of my party said their food wasn't great either. 
I'll be back for drinks though!"}
{"text":"The Ambiance is Fantastic!!! More so, than the food. I'm not sure that the place won out in the end. 

Our server Ja-Sarah was super bubbly, really informative, and sweet girl! We lucked out to have her for our first time coming here. 

Beverages:
· 3 Card Monte- a nice change from the Hendrick gin a tonic but, it wouldn't become a regular. 
· Margarita Mimosa- not bad, but I'd stick with the regular mimosa.

My Meal..
· Small Salad w/ ranch- Excellent! I got the mixed greens, cucumbers, and cheese. Incredible it was only $3. Located under sides, it seamed like a full size salad to me. What a great deal! 

· Mac-n-cheese- was very disappointing. It had a smoked or bacon type flavor.
· Seasonal Veggies- very good for the first order, however the second order was way over salted. 


My friend's meal..
· Shrimp and grits- mehh! She ate the shrimp and the toast. Definitely not a favorite."}
{"text":"We've come here a few times with the follow up visits being out of shear convenience since the parking deck we have a spot for is right next door. Food is decent bar food but the service leaves A LOT to be desired. 
The hostess staff mimics the hostess staff from the movie Date Night, rude and stuck up in a way that is pretty comical but still not appropriate for what you would expect a front of house staff to be. To be fair, we've always had great, friendly waitresses. 
They have a good variety of beers and mimosa deals on Sunday's but that's if you can even get a table. We stopped for brunch one day and were quoted a 3 hour wait. 3 hours?!!! Entirely not acceptable for a casual bar restaurant. When we were walking out the door to another restaurant all we saw were open tables, waitstaff standing around, and a good amount of people who decided they wanted to wait hours for a table, so clearly understaffed in the kitchen as well. 
Sigh, this place has huge potential being in a great location and having great ambiance but they need a major revamp on the staff."}
{"text":"While the place has a great location, the service was pitiful.  I sat down with my family and was ignored for 10 minutes.  We then ordered drinks and dinner.  It took 35 min for them to deliver one of our four drinks.  When I approached the manager she walked away. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. Dina was our waitress and she was not very friendly or helpful. We asked for menu suggestions and her responses were very sarcastic and borderline rude. Also, she did not get our orders correct. 

We started off with the Mac N Greens with bacon. It was surprisingly good, so I was excited about the rest of the food. Once it came we were disappointed. The chicken and waffles were ok. The salmon Benedict was not the best. It was supposed to come with glazed salmon. It was dry and the poached eggs were cooked all the way through. All of our food needed a generous amount of salt.

Chad was helpful and tried to make up for our table's complaints."}
{"text":"I'm kind of disappointed with this place and I had high hopes. I went for an early birthday celebration and loved the drink specials; $2 mimosas $4 doubles, I love it. But the service is terrible and there's 0 customer service. After waiting almost 2 hours for a table we go to the hostess stand to check and see that the hostess had taken the wrong cell phone number down and had given our table away. We tried to do ask a manager but all he said was that we could wait some more (30 more minutes?!) or split us up between booths. Finally we were sat and ordered food. That ended up being a disappointment too, a friend and I ordered breakfast potatoes and they were burnt to a crisp. Inedible. Another friend of mine waited 30 min for her potatoes after not receiving them with her food originally. They looked normal and edible and drastically different than mine. We called another manager to the table and showed him what was being served (I mean so burnt you should not and could not  serve it) and he apologized and went to the kitchen to get more. I appreciated it but I still don't know what the kitchen thinks food is or why the wait staff would think it was okay to serve something like that. All in all a disappointing experience, especially one for a birthday. I might just be back for drinks"}
{"text":"Great cocktails, their signature drink is my favorite. The menu consists of pretty classic American/bar food items with some interesting takes. Their appetizers are great for sharing. Their decor is interesting to say the least. The outdoor patio is my favorite place to sit, great view of BB&T Ballpark, some classic Charlotte buildings. Amazing to view for sunsets! I've been there twice and definitely plan on going back. However, the service is hit or miss. My first server was great & attentive, the second one sucked. She was rude, slow, totally inattentive, even dropped a drink....into my friends PURSE! And didn't even apologize. I wish I had remembered her name but she was awful. Definitely won't be going back there for a while."}
{"text":"My first impression of this restaurant was great and then....we waited about 5 minutes to be seated. Once seated the waitress was kind. Not very friendly but at least she smiled. She took our order, the food came quick and she brought us a refill. She never came back to our table. Why???? Because she and 3 other staff members just stood at the drink station and talked and laughed. When I finally got her attention after several tries she finished her conversation and came over to see what we needed. I gave her a bit of advice....MAKE YOUR MONEY!!! I was not impressed with the food and terribly disappointed by the lack of service. To have a restaurant in a prime location does not give a pass for giving good service. The crowd was ok, the price was average, the music was ok, the food was ok. If the service was better, I'd go back. With the service being as bad as it was I don't think I'll be going back....."}
{"text":"Best steak I have ever had. Ordered the filet mignon and it was tender, juicy and tasty as can be. I've worked for Mortons Steakhouse and this surpasses by far. 
Super trendy and modern place. Always busy. Tons of people watching to be done."}
{"text":"I have friends that work here. I only went for the first time last night after 96.1 concert.....This place is awesome!!! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great service from Lee McClennin our serverlast evening. 
Drinks and food are just okay."}
{"text":"They improved their menu and for sure their customer service has been stepping up. I stopped coming here a while back before their food was just terrible and their menu was changed. I visited them again after 1 year, I must say, their food and menu improved, not to mention their customer service, I had a problem with a plate I ordered and the server immediately corrected the issue and gave me a discount to help the situation - I didn't even ask for a credit but it was nice to know they are trying to make the customer happy. I will comeback now"}
{"text":"Looks like they have added a veg friendly pasta dish! :) 

I went for dinner this time around... nice music... good drinks... long wait for a table... but goes by quickly when you're sipping on cocktails and people watching."}
{"text":"All the locals recommended this place, and it didn't disappoint!  Excellent atmosphere, food, drinks, service, and people watching.  A hotspot, for sure!"}
{"text":"The worst wings ever. First don't serve Cornish hen wings. Ones with broken bones sticking out. If you do, don't water down the BlueCheese dressing. Just the worst. Worst.

Update:  To be fair, I did not give the establishment the ability to correct by bringing it to their attention. But...  multiple people were in the process of cooking and delivering the meal and were either uninterested or un empowered to send back if this was not the usual quality of the wings. But \"Everything\" was off including what tasted like ranch with blue cheese crumbled in it.  I was going to ask for the blue cheese that I ordered until I hit the crumbles. It was my first time there and from out of town.  Seems like a great place and could have other items that are of quality."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying our waitress Mandi was absolutely awesome and I give her 5+ stars!  She was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. I absolutely love the atmosphere here as well. Awesome booths, awesome décor and cool bar area. I had a cup of tomato bisque for an appetizer. The flavor was very good but it had more the consistency of a salsa or marinara. Pretty chunky for a soup but flavor was good.  I also had the mussels and they were very good but the bread that came with them was not very good. Extremely crunchy and kind of crumbled into dust as I ate it. Good bread is a must for the mussels dish to sop up all of the amazing sauce! I also had one of their signature drinks which was delicious but strangely tasted (and felt) like it had no alcohol in it....weird???....but still delicious.

The main reason I give only 3 stars is the bread and the host staff. When I got there, there were about 4 young people standing at the hostess station having a great conversation but didn't seem to notice, or care that I had walked in (OK, I'm no Jennifer Lopez so I guess I can't blame them LOL!). Luckily I spotted my friends and proceeded to our table. But when our party of 3 left, still there were at least 4 people at the front door host station but no acknowledgement whatsoever, or \"thank you\" for coming in....oblivious.

I will definitely try this place again as it has a great vibe and atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time in the QC @inknivyclt. Have to say not impressed. Website stated fresh seafood however oysters were average. Salmon BLT was on point. Server was mildly rude, everything we asked for she acted as if it were a chore. I'm a non-drinker and coffee was old and horrible."}
{"text":"This was definitely a fun place to grab dinner! 

I met my coworkers after work and the place was packed. Other reviews have mentioned that this place has a lot going on...but  I'm a fan of the decorations and hustle and bustle. It just makes the place feel more fun. If I worked closer I'd definitely add this to my happy hour spots! 

For dinner I opted for a beer and the shrimp tacos. Believe it or not, my portion was considered a \"snack\"! It can totally be a meal. I'd absolutely recommend them! 

I left full and happy. I'm looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool.
I don't go to the hotspots very often, but I do very much enjoy this one.
The food and drinks are good, but it's the vibe, and my server of choice that really seal the deal for me. Her name is Marissa - she's funny, and provides a great experience. Very knowledgeable on the menu selections, which is great for newbies like myself. Keep up the great work, will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Never met such a slimy and cowardice management team. We paid $44 for two tickets to the Halloween party the bar was throwing. Come to find out, this sketchy mismanaged dump was not charging a cover fee up until 10pm. They advertised that wrist bands after 10pm would be required and anyone already inside the bar by 10pm would have to pay the $22/ticket to stay. That was absolutely false and I ended up paying the $44 for tickets (in advance) for no reason at all. When I confronted the manger at the bar to see if I could get a refund (because tickets were evidently not required), he stated \"that's the gamble you take when you pay cover at a bar.\" What???? Incredibly rude, unprofessional and deceitful. Will NEVER go back to ink and Ivy."}
{"text":"Ink and Ivy has a wide variety of options to choose from on their menu that will leave you nothing short of satisfied. The place is huge and has a very \"Alice and Wonderland\"-ish vibe with lots of cool and unique wall decor. The staff was very friendly, however, it took a bit longer than we would have liked for our food to come out."}
{"text":"I was excited to visit this spot because of all the good things I have heard.  My wife and I went on Easter Sunday and the food was AWESOME!  However, the service left more to be desired.  The waitress wouldn't even look at us while taking our order, she was spacey and just looked out the window.  We ordered a second mimosa and it never came.  Before we asked for the bill she told us that they ran out of champagne, and once we got the bill; she then said she would take the drink off the bill (of course because we never received it) She rarely came by to check on us, and she NEVER refilled our waters. The menu was not up to date with their current prices, the $2 listed mimosa for the weekend was actually $3 or $4, which is fine, but the correct information should be listed. 

We had such high hopes for this spot, but we were pretty let down, a server can make or break the experience. Good luck."}
{"text":"We just left dinner is was absolutely horrible . My husband had the lamb , really bad . I had the wings and they were dry and still had feathers . I am beyond disappointed . Please don't eat here ."}
{"text":"Keep in mind this is not NY, Miami, LA, ect... That being said, it's awesome! The atmosphere is open and inviting, love the decor, the food is surprisingly delish, specifically the buffalo chicken sandwich, it's as big as my fist and I have large hands! (heeeyyyy). The staff is friendly and attentive. As of this review, it's the new place to be \"scene\" in Uptown. Many Panthers players hangout here (for whatever that's worth). Fri & Sat the place is wall 2 wall packed (obvi) but not so much where you can't maneuver. The patio is my favorite aspect of this place! Spacious, modern, and colorful. The patio overlooks Romare Bearden park. Although feel free to go casual, I've noticed most people are semi dressed up, just sayin!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner with friends. It was busy and LOUD! Not loud from customer talk, the music was on concert mode. We were seated in the section of the best waitress I've encountered! She was bubbly, sweet and awesome! (Hate I can't remember her name ). I ordered the salmon BLT with the au gratin potatoes. The salmon was grilled to perfection. I didn't taste any added seasoning to the filet, other than the light char from the grill. The bacon....mmmmm, bacon  added smokiness to bring up the flavor.  The toasted bun and garnishments made it a total package.  Potatoes and cheese are always a win with me! My friend ended up eating half of my side (and she ONLY wanted a taste...smh)."}
{"text":"This was my first time being there and I was completely surprised by how good the food was. A little over priced but still good. The Grilled Veggie Pasta was AMAZING!!!! I just recently turned vegetarian and was afraid there wouldn't be anything I could eat...THEN I DISCOVERED THE PASTA!!! THANK YOU INK & IVY."}
{"text":"I have been eating here multiple times a week since this restaurant opened, and I am disappointed that they just raised the prices above what the average person can afford for a daily lunch. For example, my quesadilla was $10 and it is now $12. That may not seem like much but when you eat out every single day it is."}
{"text":"I ordered several appetizers (nachos, shrimp tacos and wings) and I found they they all to be average. The atmosphere is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Came to Ink N Ivy on a Sunday afternoon with my friend for lunch and had a wonderful experience. Our waitress was Lauren and she was awesome! Super easy to talk to and very outgoing. I would suggest ordering the Steak Salad because it is so good!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place however the service is absolutely slow. The hostesses never smile.

I liked the brunch but the lunch was better. 
2$ mimosas during brunch so you can't beat that.

When I went for lunch I got the goat cheese burger and it was phenomenal. SO fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been wanting to check this place out for several weeks. We finally did & are now regular goers. They have a pretty solid late night menu which for us night owls is awesome! Weeknights are a little less busy which is actually a nice feel while the weekend nights are popping! Bartenders are extremely responsive & very friendly which is the main reason we continue to come back. Craft cocktails are awesome with competitive pricing. The decor inside is KICKASS. The coolest vibe. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, crowd, music, and yet the food was just okay. I had the crap cakes (dry overcooked), stonegound grits (amazing), and string beans (stems could have been cut off prior to cooking). Definitely worth going back to experience it over again."}
{"text":"Trendiness and cool factor are off the charts. Quite a place to see and be seen. Food was so so. I had the chicken and waffles. The waffle was pretty good. The chicken was over cooked, which seems hard to do when frying unless you are really not paying attention. The flavor was also quite bland, lacking in seasoning. I wish I had just come for drinks, which I would gladly do again."}
{"text":"great service , food comes out fast. Food was so good !!! You have to try the spicy fried oysters and the rack of lamb!! I will defiantly be back!! The waitress was super nice and gave us some details on the food and how it was cooked and the concept. My new favorite spot uptown!!"}
{"text":"My dad and I stopped by for drinks on the weekend. The decor is very unique and the HUGE outdoor patio looks like something straight out of Alice & Wonderland. 

The bartender was friendly but kept letting us know the countdown by minute until she was off of work.... no one cares. The mojito I had and my dad's mimosa were tasty. I'd go back to try the food."}
{"text":"We went here a second time tonight and it was really a let down. The first time was amazing and everything was delicious. This time when we walked in there was four people at the host station and not one of them acknowledged us. We were the only people standing there too. So we stood there waiting for them to be done talking to each other. 

Then they sat us at a table and it was so loud it was a bit ridiculous. The football game was on which was cool but at every commercial their DJ would blast his music so we pretty much had to yell to talk to each other and I would understand this if we had gone to a club but it's a restaurant. 

  We got two appetizers, shrimp tacos and the fried cheese. Both were really good! That fried cheese, Wow!! But then we ordered food I got the BBQ platter, which was smoked chicken, ribs, pork and andouille sausage, I was very excited for it! My fiancé got the chipotle lime chicken. Both were underwhelming. Everything on my platter was bland. The andouille was ok but everything else wasn't worth it. And his pasta was just very lime-y, again not worth it. 

We talked to our server and she told her manager. He came over to us and was very nice and did take my meal off the bill. We really appreciated it. We really wanted to like ink n ivy because our first time there was so great! But we really aren't sure we'll be returning. 



We happened to go on their first official night open, we were looking for somewhere casual and new to try before we headed to a show. 

We sat at the bar inside which was packed. The bartender was very nice but very overwhelmed, first nights are hard! We got a drink menu and food menu. They had a number of specialty cocktails and tons of small dishes and hand helds to eat OH plus a raw bar! I got the poison ivy cocktail which was sweet but delicious and my boyfriend got the Morgan's mule also good. 

We orders spicy fried oysters and shrimp tacos which were on the \"snack\" menu. They were good sized portions and the presentation of each was lovely. The fried oysters were just spicy enough and served with black bean pure and salsa, I would definitely get them again. The shrimp tacos came on corn tortillas and were a little spiced but not overwhelming. We decided we were still hungry so we got the quesadillas to split. They can come with pulled pork or chicken and we opted for the chicken which I was so happy with. The quesadillas were amazing and I would go back just for them! 

All in all service was great and the food was delicious. It was a little pricy but what can ya do, it seemed worth it for the portions and quality."}
{"text":"Great patio for happy hour! Michael, our waiter, provided exceptional service. After an unexpected downpour, we had to move off of the patio to a table inside. Michael even offered to have the kitchen re make our food. Michael was incredibly attentive to our drinks and never let our glasses get less than half full. Exceptional waiter, great crab cakes, and a super fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Our waitress was super nice and gracious during our stay but our actual time leading up to eating was a nightmare. We called ahead and got there really early and they said they'd have a table for us. When we checked back the table was outside...in the 35degree weather. We had been there for 2hr at that point waiting for everyone else to arrive. No tables for 10 opened up in that time? After speaking with the manager numerous times we finally got sat at a table inside. The drinks took a long time to get to us, my friend's chicken was undercooked and our food came out all at different times and some of it cold. Any one of these things wouldn't ruin an experience but all things considered: the wait, the drinks, the undercooked food, etc. means that I will definitely not be back. Nice decorations though..."}
{"text":"Very diverse & great seating outside! The brunch was amazing & they had great mimosa specials."}
{"text":"Fun, cool new bar in uptown. The service has definitely gotten a lot better since they were new. I like this as an after-work drink spot."}
{"text":"I got severe food poisoning from the BBQ platter. Stay away!

Food was ok, service was ok. The place has potential, but after hugging the toilet for hours I'm not prepared to give it another chance. It's sad, because the place has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"We were told this was a must place for dinner!  Total
Disappointment!  $36 filet butterflied to
1/4 inch thick.  Goat Cheese burger was a frozen burger. Wine was served in hot wine glasses!  So disappointed in our dinner.  Do not waste your money!"}
{"text":"Ink n Ivy was a lively and fun place after it first opened, but I've noticed the service go down pretty quickly over the past year or so. Last night we were there with a group of six people for food/drinks and had a couple issues: (1) The waiter seemed overwhelmed and kept forgetting things (2) Two of the drinks weren't made right, and instead of being empathetic, the manager tried to explain how we were wrong. It took some pushing to get the drinks redone. (3) In general - the venue tries to have an upscale vibe (and upscale pricing), but the quality seems to be dropping."}
{"text":"We hosted a college alumni association event here on Thursday night with about thirty-five or so people in attendance.  With the help and assistance of Sarah Ikalowych, the Events Manager, the event turned out to be a huge success!! The outdoor slab high-top table was reserved for us, which was the perfect gathering area for our group.  Everyone enjoyed the wide variety of delicious appetizers...chicken quesadillas, chips and salsa, and chicken fingers with dipping sauces)..with the chicken fingers being the overall favorite.  They were delicious! We cannot thank everyone enough at Ink N Ivy for being so cooperative and accommodating. I highly suggest this venue if you are planning to host an event."}
{"text":"I realize they just opened, but the service was horrible and the food was not that good either. There were 5 of us and we asked for a table on the patio. There seemed to be about 5 hostesses and none of them communicated with one another. We asked if they needed our name and we were told no, they would come and get us. We then watched as tables opened up and they sat people that came in after us. We then asked about it and another hostess told us they needed our name to put us on the wait list. We then waited 30 more minutes, were finally told there was a table... a hostess walked us to the table and as we got to it noticed another hostess had sat another party at the table. They then sat us at another table which was dirty and cleaned it as we sat there. A hostess gave us one menu and 3 place settings (for 5 of us). We then sat there for 10 minutes until I finally went in and asked for a manager.  I told the manager our experience and she said she would get a waiter right over and was sorry. A waiter did come over and we placed our drink order. 2 of our 5 drinks came 10 minutes later. We waited another 10 minutes for the other drinks. 
We ordered our food and it came out at a reasonable amount of time. It was very basic. 
The decor was cool and the location is great. I hope their service and food improves, because it was a sh!t show! I'm not surprised that it's the same company that owns Hot Taco... another restaurant that is a mess"}
{"text":"I will never go back to this restaurant. Of all the great places in Charlotte, do NOT waste your time going here. Not only is the food mediocre at best, but the staff is pompous and extremely rude. The bar tenders are dismissive and the management is terrible.

They yelled at me and my friends for asking them to make our drinks in reusable, environmentally friendly cups, just dismissing us and saying its policy and they can't. Upon us asking specifically what this policy is, just genuinely wanting to know, the bartender got in our faces saying that it's her choice to serve us and she didn't have to do anything. Literally all over us politely asking them to put our drinks in reusable cups instead of plastic throw away cups. Then the manager came up and threatened to kick us out and also refused to explain said policy. AWFUL management, awful staff, awful people. 

If you're going to go out to eat or even just grab drinks, you're better off going to an actually respectable establishment with accommodating staff and worthwhile food/drink."}
{"text":"Was seated at a table just to be insulted. Ordered an appetizer just to be interrogated. Didn't even order an alcoholic beverage. This place has the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Order two classes of water dropped a 20 on the table and left."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and each time the service has been consistently upbeat.  The last visit included food & drinks at the bar.  Even though it was busy, Bartender Ryan did a great job of making us feel valued.  The fried oyster salad was tasty & surprisingly filling.  Now, I just have to make time to try their brunch."}
{"text":"Dope looking restaurant, but unfortunately the 90 sanitation grade is not.  The lunch menu consists of salads and sandwiches, the waitress was nice and made a few recommendations but disappeared after she delivered the food.  The food came out pretty fast and my chicken sandwich was huge and looked great.  The chicken breast was very thick and chewy, they should probably use a thinner chicken breast.  The fries were pretty good, so just ok for me."}
{"text":"Fun spot uptown to grab some food and drinks-great outdoor space for nice weather!  The patio overlooks Romare Bearden Park and the interior decor is funky and fun.  We usually stop in here for a drink so I can't speak to the food menu, but the bar service has always been quick and efficient!"}
{"text":"We sat down for the late night menu, because that's what the hostess said to do. Sat down.... waited for 20 minutes. We asked a waiter to have to the server of our table to please come see us. 10 more minutes. Nothing. We walked out and left. Terrible service. Decent atmosphere. Would be way better if the service had actually been decent."}
{"text":"This spot is Sleek, fun, and vibrant. The decor is amazing it looks like an upscale boutique/bar. The location is right uptown you can sit outside and see the sitting while you eat. The best pictures for instagram of course. So I went for Sunday brunch I had the chicken and waffles. I know what you are thinking you have had one chicken and waffles you have had them all. But did all your chicken and waffles come with a $2 mimosa yes that's only during brunch. And are you surrounded by beautiful chandeliers the latest tunes from the radio and a centric type vibe. I think not. This place is hands down one of my new favorite brunch spots."}
{"text":"Went for lunch one day and the food and service were good. The decor is really cool and has a different vibe and I enjoyed the atmosphere as well. It's worth checking out for even a drink

I got the COFFMAN'S CHICKEN SANDWICH and fries.  The chicken was cooked well and had a lot of flavor I really enjoyed the sandwich and would recommend it."}
{"text":"You wouldn't think this bar type place has good food but let me tell you. It was great! When you first walk it it looks more of a lounge/ bar, with tvs everywhere. It more spread out so you're not so next to the next table. We went and got sat down quick. The server was great, showed us the best things on the menu. We got the smoked wings, calamari, potato skins for appetizers. For entrees we got the shrimp linguine and the goat cheese burger without the goat cheese and sub for cheddar! It's possible guys! Lol it was delicious there was bits in chorizo on top of my potatoes that gave it an extra kick. Everything was amazing! It barely fit on the table and I wish I couldve tried everything on that menu foreal. We also tried two fruity cocktails which were fantastic. They were the poison ivy and the truth serum. They were both fruity and you just can't get one. We're extremely satisfied with everything from the service to the meals. We will definitely be back and with more people!"}
{"text":"Finally stopped by for brunch with a fellow Elite. The decor is unique. Greeted by a host. Then Marcus came by to introduce himself right away., I for some reason was ready to have some fun so I gave him a hard time. He all in all took it very well and still manage to provide great service. 
I ordered the steak and eggs.. comes with potatoes or grits. I optioned for potatoes. My friend ordered chicken and waffles. Our drinks was some kind of mimosa and a gentleman cocktail. It has whiskey to it. Should remember what it is. My steak came out the way I wanted it. Medium rare and hot. Shared with my friend so I get to tried some waffles and chicken. I know that it's made with buttermilk but has a seasoning that I can't put my finger on.. waffles was light/airy. Chickens was crispy.. Steak was seasoned right. The meal was overall enjoyable! I would love to come back to try out the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Hit it late night (after 11) for brews and a bite... and this place is awesome!  Shrimp Tacos and Fried Cheese were both very flavorful and fresh, beers were great, and service was very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Upbeat and fun setting. Awesome food and beer/wine selection but service was incredibly slow."}
{"text":"I came out for an amazing PR event with PAC Public Relations and Cynthia Bailey (Real Housewives of Atlanta.)

The staff, food, and drinks were amazing. The event went off without any issues and certainly made an impact on me. I'll be back just based on how great the staff was towards us. It was during CIAA weekend and it was insanely busy between the CIAA events and our private event, however they never faltered or seemed stressed. Rarely see that out in CLT!"}
{"text":"One of the best finds I found in Charlotte!!! Such a punk, green neon eclectic place. I walked into tattooed waiters and neon green lights. It has amazing art work on the walls and a huge outdoor patio. The food was amazing and their cocktail menu was huge and had some unique selections. I got a buffalo chicken sandwich which was bigger than my head!!! The Salmon BLT was cooked perfectly and the salads can feed 3 people. But the best thing there was the French 5 onion soup, blew my freakin mind!!! A+++ $-$$"}
{"text":"It could have possibly been a good time if it wasn't for the security there! Every time someone got up to use the bathroom or even moved 2ft away from the table, the security would TAKE OUR CHAIRS!!! Even if we told him that were still utilizing the chairs they STILL TOOK THEM! The most insane thing I've ever seen! I'll never spend money in here again!!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever received st any bar.  Their computer system went down and they would not close my tab, nor could they confirm what would be charged so I am basically being held hostage until they are back online. Lesson learned. Do not ever leave a tab open at this place."}
{"text":"Great addition to Charlotte to gather with your friends. I love the outside patio and drinks here. Whether you're gathering here after a game, brunch, or just a night out, this place has a great vibe. I was very impressed with the service and great munchies. When you visit, ask for Eric! He made our night!"}
{"text":"I've been many times. I like the food. The service is hit or miss. I love the bloody Mary bar on the weekend. But I live across the park and can hear the music from my livingroom... so it's hard not to be a little bitter that they blatantly ignore city noise ordinances"}
{"text":"Modern atmosphere but dinner was not good. Menu has only a few options. I would not go back for any reason."}
{"text":"Eh, I think I'm getting old because this wasn't  the scene for me. The crowd here is like 21 to 28, maybe older.  But I'm to old to stand all night and deal with excessive crowds and pushing. Their is barely any seating, unless you sit on the restaurant side-- which kind of runs into the bar. The atmosphere is nice here and it's decorated nicely.But it's a really busy spot and gets crowded really quick. We also had to travel around the bar in a full circle because none of the bartenders made the speciality drinks listed on their menu. Like what do you mean try another bartender? Luckily I came comfy and not dressed to impress. I think I will have to pass on visiting here again, not my crowd and I don't feel like going on a \"where is Waldo hunt\" for a drink on YOUR menu."}
{"text":"A couple of things: Avoid the grits, they are terrible, unless you order tasso gravy on the side, which is a dollar for a small side of it. If you want a mimosa and want the $2 one, make sure you specify. They'll give you a big glass for $4 without asking. Eggs were terrible. Sausage is awesome!"}
{"text":"We come here before we go to Knights games and haven't been disappointed yet. Actually, we got above and beyond treatment the first time we came here. We had our two dogs and were afraid they wouldn't let us sit with them on the patio. However, they did!!! They were extremely pet friendly. They brought use bowls of ice water for the dogs and kept checking on them to make sure they were okay. I was happy to see they had Titos for the drink special and was happy with my drinks that I ordered. We got wings which were really good as well! Only little qualm we had was when we saw the bill. $50 for two vodka sodas, two beers, and 2 pounds of wings. Next time we will keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Definitely a lively 'hot spot' with a great DJ & tasty cocktails but average service & food. 
Also, while I know it was right after a winning Panthers game, so it's going to be packed, I could barely hear the person sitting beside, at our dinner table. Music was way too loud for 6pm on a Sunday, in the dining area."}
{"text":"Location and patio is the reason to come here. The food is horribly inconsistent and service is always mediocre at best. Have a couple drinks, maybe an app and then go have a meal somewhere else."}
{"text":"Well I can definitely say my 2nd experience was MUCH better! Because of my 1st experience, I was invited back for a meal on them. Even on a busy Friday night, we (a party of 5) were seated immediately and our server came to greet us shortly thereafter. I showed her the yelp message I got, manager came out and said \"Well I guess your meal is in us today\". Quick & easy :) The last time we came, most of our party disliked their food. Could've been an off night, idk. This time everyone liked their food. I had the crab cakes with sauteed spinach and mac & cheese (mac & cheese could use some tweaking). Quesadillas, burgers and nachos were also ordered and everyone was happy. Atmosphere is still great. They have a good vibe overall. Will be back again. Hope the service and food will mimic my 2nd time here. Oh and my drink was on the house too. Not shabby at all :)"}
{"text":"Its too bad the food here is so badly done and has absolutely no creativity. You'd think a restaurant with such great decor would have food to compliment. Even the simple items on the menu are poorly executed. I had the nachos, they were drenched and soggy. The pork belly sliders were also disappointing. The pork belly was tough and it's supposed to be tender and succulent. The atmosphere on the other hand is great. It's always busy and lively."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere make this place a must visit if you live in Charlotte or are just visiting the city!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  Let me start with my most recent experience yesterday 3/17/18 which was strictly for the bar. 

My friends and I did the RB st pattys day crawl and this bar was listed as one with specials ($4 bud light, $6 liquor).  
However they were ripping people off.  I ordered a bud light and was charged $6.  And the lady was a real B when I asked why it wasn't $4 like it was supposed to be.  Then my friend ordered a whiskey and coke and was charged $8 and again got attitude when he asked why it wasn't the $6 special.  They advertise as one of the bars with the beer specials but they are defnitely not and are just stealing people's money. 

First visit was for lunch and it was ok but I would never go back just for food.  Over priced and not that great.  Head across the street to Valhalla."}
{"text":"We were having a great time here as a group of seven girls until some guy named \"Blue\" was extremely rude to us and kicked us to the curb as we were waiting for a cab when leaving. We told him a cab was coming in a few min and he proceeded to throw us out in the cold and was very disrespectful."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was cool, staff was great! And the nachos were the best I've ever had! Really want to try all of the oyster options next time!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, GORGEOUS decor, okay food. I think the kitchen is still working out a few kinks, the food is good, but not mind blowing and not always consistent. However, the place is seriously gorgeous and so much fun! It gets pretty busy at night and has a great crowd."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute joke. I went here almost a year ago and should have wrote this sooner. Try again and ridiculousness again. 

First time I came, the food was terrible. The place was chaos no one knew what was going on. So I ended up ordering food it was wrong not once, but twice!! The manager came up and apologized and did the manager thing but seriously f'ing up a meal twice, come on guys. Over it. The only thing they have going is the ambience but it's still a cluster.

Second time, last night for the fight. I came dressed nice, had a jacket on and didn't look like a scumbag or any type of person that is going to be shady, which I've seen plenty of them go through these doors. First off, I called, they didn't answer had to call again. I finally talked to someone and they were charging a $20 cover for the fight. Which to me I don't understand at all but whatever, then they said we have tables available and put me on hold. Then when whoever came on I couldn't hear them because their phones were static and I kept saying hello and nothing. Not my daily. Fix your phones!

So I walked down there, I asked how much is the table. They said $400. WTF!!!! $400 for a table for what? For nothing. None of the $400 even went towards food or drinks. Help me understand how on earth this is reasonable?? And whoever paid for that is dumb. I haven't been in a while because of my first experience so I wanted to check it out again. He said either way it's $20. I'm not paying $20 to stand and see with a bunch of other idiots. So I ended up leaving. 

I will never be back again. This place is not worth it, the food is nonsense and so is this place. No wonder they only have 3 stars and tons of reviews."}
{"text":"Yeah, wont be going there after work any time soon unless the manager sticks to his word.  

It's Negroni Week and the bartenders didnt even know how to make one. And since it took 3x to get lemons for our water and were served something that looked like vodka/cranberry....we left. I guess if it's not wine or beer, dont ask."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and the salmon sandwich with fries was very good.  No fishy smell or taste.  Tasted fresh.  Bread was fresh.  Fries were good.  Enjoyed the meal.  Have been back three times and food has been good."}
{"text":"3.5. I came to Ink and Ivy with some co-workers during the week. There were 6 of us, so I called ahead to make a reservation, however they said they didn't take reservations- dumb. We arrived around 1:00pm and waited about 10 minutes for our table. It was on a Friday and the place was pretty packed.

The inside of Ink & Ivy was pretty funky.  It was a mix between a cocktail lounge, bar and restaurant. They have plenty of big TVs throughout, which is great for sporting events and they have a HUGE outdoor patio. It was cold so we sat inside, but I imagine this place will be popping once it warms up.

My group was greeted by our server upon seating and we were made aware of their Friday drink special- $5 Titos. Score! The menu consists of a variety of different options- from seafood (a lot), salads, soups and sandwiches. I heard the menu changes for dinner and they also have a raw bar.

I ordered the tomato soup and the grilled cheese because I felt like being a kid. Others got the pulled pork sandwich and salads. The \"creamy\" tomato soup was super chunky, but had great flavor. The grilled cheese on the other hand looked pathetic. Everyone laughed and said it looked like they ran over to the 7-11 and purchased white bread and threw a piece of cheese on it. For $11 I was expecting something better. My coworkers said the pulled pork sandwich and salad were good through.

Overall, I hope Ink & Ivy does well in this location as it was totally lacking something in this space for a long time.  I'm not sure if I'll be back in a hurry for food, but the patio and drinks are worth a visit."}
{"text":"A great venue in uptown, however, very disappointed by the poor service and loud atmosphere. The food was good when serviced correctly. (In a party of 7, one person got the wrong order and another only got half of her order). The waitress was short and not attentive. Although the venue was nice,I would not return."}
{"text":"Came for a work party and I was surprised at how good the food was. The party included a breakfast for dinner buffet with chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits, biscuits and all the other fixin's. 

The bartenders are AWESOME and kept up with this wild crew amazingly well. Drink prices are reasonable and good portions. 

Definitely somewhere I would frequent again."}
{"text":"Ginger jalapeno dressing.  That dressing alone is worth the 5-star rating - sweet, slightly spicy and oh, so yummy!  

The venue is a hybrid trendy restaurant and sports bar.  There's indoor and outdoor seating, great drink specials and tasty food."}
{"text":"The ambiance was awesome, location was great, food was good with the exception to 1 issue I had and the service was awful.  I definitely would not go back for lunch.  It took almost an hour to get our food and the whole time we just kept hearing your food will be out shortly.  I ended up going back to work still hungry.  The only way I would ever go back is if I was just getting drinks or going with a group that coordinated to meet there."}
{"text":"I had a lot of hope for this place, as it is right across the street from my work. The menu seemed to have good options for lunch and to be reasonably priced, even if it was a bit uninspiring. 

After giving them two tries for lunch, I think it's safe to say I will not be back for anything other drinks in the future. 

On both trips it took 40+ minutes for our food to come after placing our order; and that's despite the restaurant being at maybe 60% capacity. The service was pretty good, but that wasn't surprising since they seem to have about 15 or so waitstaff running around. I just don't understand how it could take so long to bring out a sandwich and side for 3 people. 

The food: first trip I went with what is usually a safe choice and had the buffalo chicken sandwich with fries. It was easily the most monstrous chicken sandwich I've ever had. The chicken breast on this sucker was twice the size of the bun. Overall it was pretty good. Fries are the extra thin cut variety and a bit over cooked. 

On the second trip I had the BBQ sandwich and mac and cheese for the side. After waiting 45 minutes, our plates finally arrived and two of us received fries for our side when we had all three ordered the mac and cheese. At least the server apologized and quickly brought out two additional sides of Mac and cheese. The fries and the mac were both burnt, and the mac was completely flavorless and basically inedible. The bbq sandwich had good flavor, but was so oversauced (despite coming with sauce on the side) that it fell apart the first time I picked it up, and became a knife and fork affair from the start. 

I'd like to give them a better rating since the service was friendly and adequately attentive, but the kitchen staff completely ruined both experiences for me. I guess with this ownership group's track record on food at their other restaurants/bars I shouldn't have been too surprised, but that doesn't ease the disappointment. There was a lot of potential for this place with the great location. However, it looks like we're cursed with another place that has put all of its attention into maximizing their profit on the happy hour crowd at the expense of putting out even a decent product from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Imagine being new to a city and staying a hotel for a month for work and wanting a great experience with a bit of normalcy. I am staying off of Tryon so I was going to be brave and take the train into Uptown to meet my favorite boss for cocktails as she  knew what NEGRONI WEEK meant to me back home. It was a week filled with a craft cocktail called a Negroni. It's a simple cocktail made with 1oz sweet red Vermouth, 1oz Gin and 1oz Campri but what makes the week great is local bars take some if the proceeds and give them to local animal shelters or rescues for kittens and puppies. Even though it maynit be the same here I could still have a cocktail that I love. 

We walked into Ink N Ivy and it was packed. A nice young man and lady were waiting on us and we ordered two waters with lemon and two Negroni's. Well we got two waters from two totally different young men wirh no lemon. We asked for lemon 3 times. The young man and lady came back and asked foe our drink order again and you can tell they had no idea what the drink was and asked us how to spell it. We not only spelled it but I showed them a picture on my phone. But what we got was Vodka and cranberry juice garnished with lime. 

They had three bartenders behind the bar and not a one of them looked up the recipe at all. After waiting on the wrong drink and lemon for water we left without my beloved NEGRONI. That was Wednesday of last week. I know you are asking why did it take me this long to write a review. Well on our way out we spoke to the manager Jim about our experience and he gave us his card and told us that if we emailed him which I did that he would learn about the cocktail and reach back out to have us back. It's Sunday and I still haven't heard from him. 

Sadly...I DID NOT ENJOY MY INK AND IVY experience and sadly I won't be back..."}
{"text":"Love coming here butttt.. when the real feel temp is 90 degrees even and the blonde manager gives your table a shitty attitude about putting the screens down, it kind of kills the vibe. Suppose we'll go else where."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after going dress shopping. We had never heard of the place before but liked the look of it so we decided to give it a try. The food was great... all three of us had and loved the macaroni and cheese side. We had salads and a buffalo chicken sandwich and all was great. They also have great drink prices ($15 bottle of champagne). We also got great service from a waiter named David. I will definitely go back for lunch next time I'm in the area.

Also the decor is very eclectic and fun."}
{"text":"We come here quite a bit after work for happy hour, and have always had a great time! Half price wine Wednesdays are MY JAM. The vibe is young and fresh, with the eclectic green and purple decor. 

I came here for dinner with a few friends, so I was able to finally try their food for once. I was soooo pleased! The three of us actually all ordered the same burger because it sounded so amazing to all of us. And MAN it really was amazing. We also got talked into ordered a dessert for the three of us to share and it literally was heaven in my mouth. That was the best piece of cake I'd had in a long time. 

Our waitress was super friendly and hip! We had great service all night. Would recommend 10/10."}
{"text":"Let's see how do I start this... 

   Well my best friend and I got there about 8 p.m and they told us it was an hour and a half wait. Which was ok because we was welling to wait. PLEASE NOTE: THEY ONLY HAVE 3 CHAIRS INSIDE TO WAIT.  The hostess asked for my name and number, I repeated it like 5 times because the music was so loud at the hostess station. We been sitting there for about an hour and fifteen mins, we noticed people coming In WAY after us and getting their table. I decided to ask the hostess on our wait time status and she could not even find my name on the wait list, she said someone must have deleted it. PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU GO THERE AND THEY PUT YOU ON THE WAIT LIST PLEASE CHECK ON YOUR STATUS AFTER 15 MINS OF WAITING!! Seems that we was not the only people who name got \"accidentally\" deleted . The waiter came to our table 3 time ( NO LIE ), that was to get our order and drinks (because we was waiting so long we already knew what we wanted to order), bring us the food and gave us the check . I had the maple salmon with mac & cheese and green beans. My salmon and mac & cheese was over cooked and the green bean was under cooked. My 1st time there around that time was just not good. The location was great. I will try there again for brunch hopefully I have a better outcome. If not I will \"X\" Ink n Ivy off my list. I do believe in second chance."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner and a few of my friends didn't enjoy their food (shrimp & grits, chicken and greens) However I loved the sweet and spicy shrimp. The Vine outside bar in the back was a good time. The music was a bit low but the drinks were strong, mixed crowd and tons of fun!"}
{"text":"I went here twice and love the decor and the staff. This place is awesome for a date night or Friday nite live. Thanks for bring it to the Charlotte area"}
{"text":"Avaerage at best. The atmosphere and design of this place is very nice. Really open space with a great patio area and DJ that plays decent party mix music. Honestly the music wasn't what I listen to but hey it might work for you. 

So just to put it out there, they do not take reservations unless you have a party of 20 or more so be prepared for that. Me and a few friends came for brunch on Sunday. They do not have a bottomless mimosa option, however, they do regular mimosas for $3 and double mimosas for $6. If you want to buy a bottle of prosecco/champagne it's 15$. I sat at the bar waiting for my friends so I had a couple mimosas and the bartenders were very nice. Once my friends came we got a table on the patio.

Great view of the city on the patio. Anyways. We got our mimosas and it kinda went downhill from there lol. Everything just took a really long time. People who ordered appetizers took awhile and it took awhile for food. It honestly took a minute for mimosas as well. When we got our food, not everyone at the table had their food at the same time so I felt bad for them.

Majority of the table ordered the salmon Bennie which the \"POACHED\" egg had no yolk running out of it. Clearly we asked for a hard boiled egg because that's how it came out. Personally I ordered a fried egg cooked medium so I had a little yolk..or so I thought. My egg was hard boiled too. The flavors were good but the seasoning wasn't consistent. I had the potatoes and some were well seasoned and some tasted like plain potato.

Idk if it's because they were busy that everything took long and food came out eh...ok but it was a disappointment. Maybe it's better here when it's not busy but the food is nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"Eccelectic atmosphere, a great place to people watch! The food was good as well. I rated it three stars because of the service. We had 2 servers show up at our table and think we got the short end of stick. She was not attentive. My husband got his meal and was almost finished eating before she came back to the table. When I got her attention, she said I didn't order anything for you. Not sure how that happened, but she better be happy that my husband paid the bill.  He left her a tip and I would not have. We asked for ketchup and she came back sat least five minutes later with packets of ketchup, saying \"I couldn't find a bottle.\""}
{"text":"Our server told us, in 69 degree weather that they couldnt cut off the fan blowing over out table. We've been here before and the fan wasn't on. So, we're sitting here cold, worth our menus literally blowing off the table... It's blown bent over in the picture. Also, there's no one else in the booths. So cutting it off wouldn't bother anyone else. However, our servers explanation is that it's IMPOSSIBLE to cut off these fans that weren't on last time we were here. We're actually about to leave and not order food or drinks."}
{"text":"WOW !!!  Apparently even though the sides are ALL THE SAME PRICE you can no longer switch the slated side without an upcharge!!!
Shady, shady.  Sadly won't be back now."}
{"text":"I am very much standing behind 4 stars on this one. Let's start with food.. I ordered my burger medium-rare and it might be the best burger in charlotte. It was thick and beautifully perfectly medium-rare, which is so rare. My husband got the Nachos with pulled pork, and it was so tatey and didn't need to be spicy to color over the quality. The pork is lightly smoked but full of flavor. Service was excellent and can I now please talk about the decor because I would like to just bathe in all of it. The wood walls with chandeliers and pugs in tutus on the ceilings and nanaste elephants tattooed with traditional tattoo and meatballs sculptures--- ah it makes my stimulus so happy :) I also hear how it becomes a night club and I can see that, DJ even there on a Sunday afternoon. Did I mention $2 mimosas and $4 extensive Bloody Mary bar on Sunday?? I'm in love."}
{"text":"Cool place. Great patio, but don't go unless you're ready to suck up to your bartender. Rude as can be. Makes you feel like you're bothering them. Veryyyyyy unwelcoming. Too cool for school type of attitude. Cool patio though"}
{"text":"Cute spot. Came here for a late dinner and drink. Super packed on a Thursday. It's near the Ball Park therefore people were hanging out here after. Prices were average and drinks were great."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere! My entree was the bomb. You have to try the snapper special. The Truth serum made with tequila.... OMG! We're definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Ink N Ivy used to be our go to lunch spot. We loved sitting out on the patio during warmer weather and the food was great. The service was always terrible...but it I thought of the service like you think of an ex. You're not on good terms, but what they got going on looks good, and you think that they've changed and it's going to be different.

Spoiler alert: It never is.

The location is great for warmer weather. The patio is perfect to hang out and drink at.There is a big banking scene after work, and before Knights Baseball games.  The lunch specials were great and had a lot of options.Also, they had gigantic mozzarella cheese sticks that were unreal.

So since it's been colder we haven't been over to Ink N Ivy, but we decided to give it a try. We were shocked to find out not only did they remove those cheesy pillows of heaven, but the menu removed all of our favorites. It now sways towards the vegetarian side. So, for the meatless lovers out there, I feel like the miso cauliflower, cauliflower sandwich, or multiple Brussels sprouts options will be your jam. 

However, not impressed with the lack of creativity or options in the lunch menu. Out of 7 avid lovers of Ink N Ivy, 3 of us ordered the fried chicken, while 4 of us ordered the burger. I think that speaks for itself.

I hate to be negative an entire review so I am going to give some positives:
The squash fritters were delicious. They were softer than I expected, and had a delicious cheesy and onion flavor.

Service was...wait for it...great! Our server was very apologetic on the menu change and offered great modifications to the menu items based on what we wanted. He was very attentive.

Hopefully the menu can change to accommodate some old favorites into the new vegetarian focused menu."}
{"text":"Ok so let me start off by saying I LOVE ink N Ivy! I have been here several times, typically frequent on Sunday's at the bar however this was the WORST experience I have had (also if it matters it was my birthday). Sooo we arrive around 10pm, not really a big crown so we get seated rather quickly. The server comes (I won't state his name), takes our drinks orders and 10 mins later returns to take our dinner order without drinks in hand. I view it as a simple oversite bc I love to grant people the benefit of a doubt however it only gets worse. 15 additional minutes pass and our drinks are served. I am dining with a vegan who has a dairy allergy and advices the server of this however when the food finally arrives, there is feta cheese in his Brussels sprouts. The remainder of the dinner was only saved by the amazing atmosphere and other servers starting small talk. I hope this is viewed by someone on management bc honestly I would hate for my favorite go to to become a past tense venue."}
{"text":"Please fully cook your chicken next time. Although I doubt I will be going back. I would advise against ordering the chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"We walked out. The male hostess has no idea what he is doing or just really sucks at it. He sat several other parties before our party despite telling us \"we'll be sat momentarily\". They weren't smaller groups either. So two huge thumbs down. We should have listened to the other bad reviews."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere. Never been to brunch with a DJ before... The most memorable thing about the visit was that the staff seemed very disjointed and unaware about pretty much everything. 

Our group of four was seated pretty quickly and we approached by a waitress who brought us all waters as we decided on our drink orders. They have a great selection of different kinds of Bloody Marys, and we all ordered a different one. After about 7-8 minutes, the waitress comes back and announces that they don't have the ingredients for the Bloody Mary that I ordered. I was taken aback that A) They did not have the ingredients and B) It took nearly ten minutes to figure out. I just went with a standard Bloody after that. 

Drinks came out and we had some questions about the menu, which we MOSTLY answered by the waitress. I chose the Grillades and Grits and was not disappointed. The chefs and cooks certainly knew what they were doing even if no one else was on the same page. We wrapped things up pretty quickly after that as two of our group had to catch a flight.

Overall disappointed with the confusion throughout the visit, but for a newer restaurant with very good food, I would like to give them another chance at some point."}
{"text":"I have been anxiously anticipating the opening of Ink N Ivy especially since I work very close to the building and have been watching the construction for a long time now. 

Well! My first visit here was for drinks and dinner before the Panthers Thursday night game and arriving at 6:30pm I'm not sure what I expected but the place was extremely packed! Hey the more the merrier ! Until you want a drink from the bar and its Amazing Race challenge to get a drink. I cant blame the place for being packed, it was game night and Ink N Ivy is the newest and hottest spot downtown. The outside bar and patio was great even with the crowd. It is definitely an unofficial networking event after work hours lol. The beer, wine and cocktail menu has a great variety and the prices are pretty much the going rate as far as I can recall.

The inside dining area and bar is very nice! But crowded as well but less crowded than the bar. All of the wait staff was great! I really wish I could remember my waitor's name but he was awesome! 

I heard the food was really good and was glad I could eat dinner even in the madness on the patio. We order a lot of appetizers so we could just share with everyone in our large party. The Nachos with pork was great!! They were a big hit with our group and was gone quickly! The Quasadillas with chicken were pretty good but the sauce that comes on the side was really good. I really wish I paid more attention or drank less when I was there lol The Chicken wings are great as well!! They were a big hit for our group. 

Overall this is a great spot for game day, after hours or the even a dinner date before the crowd gets there. There was a DJ playing inside, I'm not sure if this is an every night thing but it was a nice touch and he wasn't overpowering with his music. Cant wait to come back  for another Panthers pregame or even dinner to try more of the menu. I heard the oysters are awesome!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you're looking for a cool bar To go to. The decor is super trendy and they have a huge outdoor patio that is heated in the winter. When I've eaten there the food has been very good. I have had some friends say that they are not yet equipped to handle the volume they get at brunch yet. Hopefully they fix this since they are still relatively new. All in all it's a pretty good place to eat but a great bar! 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"The bar witnesses are EXTREMELY RUDE. Service here is not appealing. I read the public health inspection reports and was disgusted.. I will NEVER eat or drink here again...."}
{"text":"I love ink and ivy, the atmosphere is so modern and chic, the music is great, and the food is awesome. I always order the poison ivy (VERY STRONG) and the quesadilla appetizer as my meal. A friend and I ordered fries to share and they taste like they were cooked in old grease so I subtracted a star. Other than that this place is one of the coolest uptown charlotte spots."}
{"text":"Great experience at Ink n Ivy! Marissa was a great sever. Very attentive and made our experience much more pleasurable. Will definitely recommend. Ask for Marissa!"}
{"text":"Favorite new all around spot in Uptown if you need lunch, dinner, bar seat pimp or brunch in a vibrant spot. Loving the atmosphere here, it's always that great contagious energy and the food drink list is on point. 
Pros
Raw Bar - check 
Tapas variety - check
Crafty, out of the box cocktails - check
Near high end spirits that make you happy - check
Music - check
Beautiful staff - check 
Comfy patio for people watching - check
Restaurant gutsy enough to change gears on the late and bring out that lounge feel with a valet dude, black rope & bouncer - check 
Swaky sexy cool - double check 
But chill enough to watch tv on any angle or view point - hell yes!

Food must try - the spicy fried oysters, fried cheese and smoked quesadilla as tapas. Also the salmon was so big & juicy well seasoned and perfectly cooked. 

Brunch - needs improvement
Seems consistent with reviews, a week ago I went for brunch and the grits were disappointing. Also seemed like brunch staff didn't have a good system as 4 waiters asked is \"this your order\". It was kinda funny but presented as a potential improvement also because it was early, 11:30am. Overall I expected a better menu, it's pretty short on options, I will stick to lunch & dinner. 

Drinks - make your way thru the menu, you can commit to that if you made is this far down my review"}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago and I'm still thinking about the food. The decor was eclectic and funky, yet comfortable. Had Coffmans chicken sandwich. It was deeelicious and tasted fresh. The chicken was tender and flavored well. Then (because I'm a fan of desserts) I ordered every dessert on the menu. (I was not the only one eating, I brought friends!! Don't judge me!) And every single one was delicious. 
I live 6 hours away. In a totally different state and I'm thinking of driving down to see family...and go to ink and ivy!"}
{"text":"Pros: wonderful view of uptown(especially at sunset), centrally located, brunch/ Bloody Mary bar, nightlife 

Cons: Food

Great place to stop after work for a happy hour, or grab a snack before a sports game. However, I wouldn't put rank it as my top choice for a sit-down dinner. The food is good, but a little more pricier than taste would warrant."}
{"text":"Embarrassingly Terrible. You can literally be standing at the bar waiting to order, and the bartender will look at you, and then continue to play on his phone for 5 minutes, like they are trying NOT to care. The most unorganized clusterf I have ever seen, they literally can't even figure out their phone systems to answer the ring.  They have had a reputation for the worst service and food since they opened, and almost a year later its the exact same."}
{"text":"Food was Meh.
Vibe was Meh.
The servers were Meh.
If you're looking to have a Meh time then Ink N Ivy is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great customer service from the hostess at the front , very friendly. Very nice atmosphere and outside patio has a very nice view of the city . Food was phenomenal as well ! The steamed shrimp is bombbbb ! Only thing i can say the drink I ordered \"poison ivy\" was a little watered down otherwise very nice sports bar spot . Forget calling ahead for seating ,they don't take reservations !"}
{"text":"Great spot for drinks especially on a Friday or Saturday night. Be prepared though, it will be busy. We went for dinner on Saturday night and had a 45 minute wait for 4 of us. We didn't mind that much since we didn't make reservations and expected that with a nice and trendy restaurant in the heart of downtown.

We were able to find a spot right at the bar to get drinks and converse while we waited. We were greeted right away by the bartender and didn't have to wait at all, which is nice especially since once it gets later on a weekend it becomes harder to get a drink at the bar because it gets so busy.

I had a moscow mule and I was very pleased with it. Once we were seated, our server greeted us right away. Excellent service! My friends picked from restaurant week and I decided to just get calamari and edamame. I love calamari and was not impressed. It was ok. It was room temperature and there was not any seasoning in the breading. Thank goodness for the sauce or else it would have been extremely bland. 

I would suggest this for a happy hour or pre-going out drinks spot. It's fun once it gets a little later at night. So go for drinks, bar atmosphere, and the patio"}
{"text":"This place has a great bar scene, but the food is just not up to snuff. There was a group of us that met up there on a Thursday evening for dinner recently. Out of the table of nine, the only thing I heard that was decent was the burger that a couple of the guys got. I, unfortunately, picked the shrimp poboy, big mistake. Get this...upon inspection, I could tell that they took the boiled shrimp that they use for the shrimp cocktail, breaded and then fried it. So, it was basically cooked twice. The breading would come right off because of this, and the shrimp itself was tasteless and tough. A couple of other people got the smoked chicken. They were disappointed as well. Why? The chicken had absolutely NO smoked flavor. Other than that, our waitress was great."}
{"text":"Came here around 11:45 on Sunday for brunch.
(This is the only reason the review isn't 5 stars) We asked to sit outside considering it was 75 degrees and there were tables open. The hosts said there would be an hour wait for outside seating, so we sat at the bar. The group who was directly behind us was told it would be an hour wait for outside as well, but as we sat at the bar we saw them being seated outside... not sure how an hour wait went by in only 5 minutes. Kind of irritated, we asked the bartender if we could be seated outside, and we were immediately. Hmm, interesting.

At noon, we ordered mimosas which were fantastic - $2 for the champagne pour, and $4 for the wine pour. I ordered the chicken and waffles which were pretty good. The chicken was a bit over cooked but was still delicious. 

The atmosphere was great. Outside seating was the place to be with views of the park and all of the buildings uptown. They had a DJ playing house music (which some people on yelp didn't seem to like, but we did) which reminded us of some spots in DC. Our waitress was awesome and admitted that she was pretty swamped with tables, however still gave us the full rundown on specials and what not. 

Being newcomers to Charlotte we weren't sure what to expect, but after this we'll definitely be back for brunch on our next visit."}
{"text":"I had already heard some much about this place from coworkers so I had to try it. I was impressed by the wait service. We were seated and served pretty quickly. The vibe was great, the food was good, and the price was just right! Definitely a great place to get together with friends."}
{"text":"Visit Charlotte from Florida and we Ate here with my family at lunchtime and the food was great!! The steak sandwich was out of this world. Our server Larissa was such a sweetheart. Very attentive, friendly and helpful. She took the time to go over the menu items with us and answered all our questions. She even gave us some advice on places to see around Charlotte since. Great experience !!"}
{"text":"Ink N Ivy has great ambiance for watching a Panthers game with comfortable seating and number/location of TVs. If I'm just watching a game with friends, I would come back to this place. However, I would not order a drink other than beer or wine. I ordered a cocktail named \"The Gentleman\" ($13) and received what I can only describe as a $3 well drink. The glass was filled with ice and mixer. The amount of whisky was so thin that it barely tinted the glass. I should have sent it back but drank it and it tasted like a $3 well drink. My wife ordered a gin martini that also came with lots of ice in the glass. Who puts ice in a gin martini? It could have been a bad bartender or this place has cheap ownership/management trying to squeeze margins with watered down cocktails. Also, the staff was a bit rude as our waitress literally threw the check down in front of me at the end of service after she stopped at our table every five minutes asking if we wanted to order more drinks. Our waitress didn't know the difference between a gin drink and a whisky drink as she placed my wife's gin martini in front of me and told me it was my whiskey drink. I said, \"I believe the whisky drink is the brown one in front of my wife.\" Her response was, \"then switch the drinks.\" Not a big deal but when the drinks are full of ice and the waitress doesn't know the difference between basic alcohol, it tells me all I need to know about the quality of the cocktails in this establishment. If I go back, I'll order a beer (I assume they don't water down the beer) and save my cocktails for a place like Copper on East Blvd or the Punch Room Uptown."}
{"text":"I've been to Ink and Ivy a couple of times. It's a good spot to meet up if you're heading out to BB&T Ballpark. Both times were basically for drinks and small bites. The interior is very cool and trendy. 

The drinks are tasty. I had wine this go around, but also remember having a very good mojito like drink last time I was here. 

I didn't recall the food being great the first time I visited. It was good, but nothing that made me have a craving. We shared some small plates. There are meals too if you want a full meal. The brussel sprouts were amazing! They were crisp and there was a spicy sauce drizzled on top that took them to the next level. I also had the spaghetti squash fritters which were okay. And I also tried some roasted potatoes. They were okay, but pretty basic as far as flavors go. 

This is a cool place to hang out at after work or before a game."}
{"text":"I loved ink and ivy! The atmosphere was perfect, as well as our service! I'm a server, so I'm kind of judgy about things unintentionally but our server recommended a ton, and was super helpful. I'd 100 percent go back! Salmon BLT is where it's at!"}
{"text":"Almost didn't come here because of the low ratings and recent poor stars. Tried it anyway and was not disappointed. They have a large list of \"social eats\" or big sharing dishes on the apps menu.  Our group of 5 chose to order a bunch of social eats and get individual salads. The 4 grilled Caesars went over well as did the 1 chopped ivy salad. Our share dishes included the Seared Ahi Tuna Wantons, Grilled Brussel Sprouts, Edemame, and Fried Calamari, and Lamb Lollichops. Portions are generous, the food came out hot and tasty. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the comfortable evening. Service was four stars."}
{"text":"The food was GREAT! But the wait was not. We were told 2 hour wait for three people. We hung around the bar for 45 minutes and watched as two tables remained empty that ENTIRE time. Upon asking the waitress for those tables why they weren't seated, we found out that the hostess didn't like the waitress and wouldn't seat her section. We sat down at one of those booths (on our own) and were served immediately. It is extremely unprofessional for a hostess to behave that way and not seat people based on some drama! People were waiting for tables for TWO HOURS! Our waitress was wonderful, but we would've still been waiting (and starving) had I not asked why those booths were empty."}
{"text":"CONS: The wait for a table was 40 mins which is understandable for brunch. Our waitress was really nice but we waited over an hour for our food (which we never actually got). A group of 6 of us ordered and only one meal was brought to the table. 15 minutes later still no more food was brought out so we told the server and she apologized and said a manager would be right over... well the manager never came. So we just left (starving might I add).

PROS: The one plate of food that came out (chicken and waffles) was tasty! The Bloody Mary bar ($4) was awesome and the mimosas ($2) were great!

I'd go back for the drinks."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late dinner (10'ish) on a busy Friday night, checked in and was told that there was a 45-minute wait. We visited the bar and had Dane give us great drink service despite the fact that the bar was crowded and busy. We meandered around, explored the outside seating area, and kept up with the games on the various screens (they're positioned pretty high, so they don't intrude on your good times if you aren't into sports). Such a diverse crowd in every way, which is always refreshing for me. Within the 45-minute wait time, we were seated and had menus in hand. I had crab cakes with grits and spinach - outstanding! My husband had jambalaya (served over spaghetti), and he thoroughly enjoyed it. Both of our adult sons had sandwiches (buffalo chicken and steak) with fries that disappeared before I could even try one (haha). Music was lively and loud, but it was after 11, so we expected that. Totally enjoyed the whole experience there!"}
{"text":"This is such a fun restaurant with a beautiful view of the city. We ate here for my boyfriend's birthday and were very impressed! I ordered the crab cakes with grits and steamed spinach. The portion was a good size and very delicious. They also have fun cocktails. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This was one of our only options when we set out looking for thanksgiving day lunch. We got really lucky! 

While the atmosphere isn't really my style - I could see it appealing to others. There are really large chandeliers that seem completely out of place. 


I was really impressed with the salads there. They all pretty much start off a $9 it's about $4-$7 to add a protein. All the salads are pretty interesting too! The kale salad comes with garlic-herb vinaigrette, white beans, feta cheese, piquillo peppers, pumpkin seeds -- it was good! The ivy house salad had balsamic vinaigrette, apple, goat cheese, sunflower seeds, chick peas -- again really fresh and tasty.

I will definitely be back for the salad!


4/16 came back for some cocktails tonight. They have $8 double titos and sodas on Monday!!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch with coworkers and was disappointed with the menu.. there weren't a lot of options and what was on there didn't really appeal to me. Check it out before you go to make sure this won't bother you. I got a quesadilla and it was unusual and had goat cheese on it but it wasn't bad at all. The service was spotty, my colleague ordered fries right after he got his wings and they didn't come until everyone else was finished eating. It was just ok. Wouldn't recommend it but it's not terrible. Probably a good spot for just drinking."}
{"text":"I usually have a nice time at Ink N Ivy, until last night. It was not due to the food or my dining service per se. It was solely contributed to the bartender, or lack thereof. My drink was poorly made as well as my girlfriends that were with me, and when I politely sent it back she told me, \"to go ahead and look at the wine list\". So that told me in itself not to order drinks from her again. Overall the experience wasn't horrible but it wasn't exactly serene either. She also proceeded to yell across the restaurant to our server saying that \"I didn't like the drink and to ring in the wine\". It was extremely unprofessional. I believe her name was Michelle."}
{"text":"I gave this place 5 stars because the first two times my wife and I came here we had the same waiter who was great, very attentive, checked on us often, and was just a cool dude. The service def made up for the average food, it's really nothing special. Brought friends here that were visiting on multiple occasions since then, and it's just been worse and worse. Our waiters during those visits were literally non existent, it got to the point where anytime a runner or random waiter would bring us something, we'd just start placing random orders for things knowing it would take forever to be relayed to our actual waiter and then brought over. Yeah, the patio area is nice overlooking the park, and it's def a Sunday funday spot, but it's gotten to the point where dealing with bad service on top of average food just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"First, you seated us next to the kitchen, drink fill area, and bathroom even though the restaurant was half empty.  I am beginning to think we didn't fit your target market of 21-25 year old millenials.  I took a picture of the empty restaurant and the kitchen/bathroom area.  You then posted a security guard to stand beside my table.

Food was overpriced and average at best.  Not coming back.  Looks good at first glance.  Then you bait and switch."}
{"text":"Came at 10:00 Pm for some food. Menu has awful selections and the food was not good at all. The collard green Mac and cheese was extremely mediocre and the calamari was not the best. Good vibes but food not worth it"}
{"text":"Loved the patio with a fantastic view of the park.  The staff was very attentive and courteous.  The menu had a unique southern appeal and the food was outstanding!  Would strongly recommend and a must stop destination in uptown."}
{"text":"I was in town for work and came here for lunch. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich. I did not like the buffalo sauce and the chicken was not seasoned. I was pretty disappointed because my friend recommended this place and he knows how I like my food. The waiter asked if I wanted to take the rest to-go and I said \"no thank you.\" This place is good for people who like game day food or a game day atmosphere. Really close to the stadium."}
{"text":"First impression. There was a hostess texting on her phone and made us wait while she finished her obviously important texting before she made an effort to seat us. We asked for a table on the patio and she said it would be a twenty minute wait. While we were deciding whether or not we were willing to wait, another hostess walked up and asked if we were being helped and was able to seat us ( at one of the many empty patio tables) immediately... lol. 
The patio was awesome. Overlooks the park. Beautiful night. Folks had their dogs and a mixed, friendly crowd are the positives. Lots of tvs on to the college football games and it was nice to watch the christmas village going on in the park. Waitress was adorable and obviously trying very hard, but managed to get all three rounds of drink orders wrong. We felt so bad for her that we all just drank what she brought and made it work. Lol again. 
Now for the food. Onion soup was almost unedible. Flavorless with burnt cheese on top. Chicken sandwich ok. Blackened shrimp salad very mediocre. Mussels with a curry sauce was cold with stale bread for dunking, like 5 day old stale tasteless white bread, couldn't even attempt to use it to soak up the mussel broth if it WAS warm. Lol again. 
So my advice would be to treat this place as a bar, not as an option for dinner, and don't be picky about your drink order. We spent $150 on pretty bad food and the wrong drinks but the patio and atmoshere was enjoyable. Not sure how far location will take this place, but I hope they'll pull the food up to par and they make it because it could be a great asset to the area."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the interior design of this establishment. It's very different for Uptown, very creative and innovative with the indoor/ outdoor concept.

Their food...... yeah just drinks. They need to revise their food menu a bit and knock up the quality of their ingredients. At over priced and doesn't taste that god honestly and I have had dinner here 4 or 5 times.

They do give you a nice size glass of wine!! 

It is a good place to come hang out with friends for a drink, even though their nickname is the Chilis of Uptown."}
{"text":"Went for brunch:

The service was amazing, super friendly, and on point.

The interior is unique without being too loud.

The food was edible. 

Conclusion: go for drinks and stick with bar food"}
{"text":"Good place to grab a drink, but if you go to eat there the service is painfully slow. I've been a handful of times since it opened, and bar service is fine, but I don't recommend it if you're wanting a quick beer and bite to eat because the waitresses are slow."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great for a night out or watching the game, but the food could have been better. I ordered the shrimp and grits here and it was pretty disappointing. The grits were very salty and dry. The valet parking was convenient and they serve you quickly."}
{"text":"before you go, read the scathing health inspection (NC Public Health Inspection).  It'll tell you everything you need to know.  Also, the service is pretty bad and slow."}
{"text":"This place is not doing well for just starting out. The bartender seemed nice and that was probably the one good thing about my visit.

I got a chicken salad wrap for lunch with the seasonal vegetables (zucchini and yellow squash). The yellow squash was so hard I couldn't even pierce it with my fork! I got done with my first half of my wrap and actually really enjoyed it, but after I took 1 bite of my second half of my sandwich I nearly choked on a huge piece of rock solid fat. I tried another bite and got several more pieces in my wrap. I lost my appetite and asked for the check.

I paid for a full wrap and side and ate half a wrap and picked the zucchini from the side dish. I wanted to like this place because of the location and I heard they have a Bloody Mary bar, but they have some serious improving to do first.

Also, while I was trying to eat a customer was complaining right next to me to the bartender (he had every reason to, but not the best eating environment). He was upset because the kitchen messed up his order 3 times and he was just ordering to go on his lunch break."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The hostess was kind of rude. We sat for about 15 minutes before someone greeted us which was fine because they were kindof busy for a Wednesday night. It was a little chilly but I sat on the patio. I was starving so I was ready to order but that took about 15 minutes to do that. The food was subpar. Prob wouldn't go back. You're basically paying for the view. Which is decent."}
{"text":"We had a great all around experience incuding the food, atmosphere, and service. We sat on the patio at sunset with great weather and I al sure that helped! I had heard very good things about Ink N Ivy but noticed the overall 3 star rating on yelp and admittedly I had some reservations about it after reading some reviews. After having such a great experience I decided to take a poll from the other 3 people I was with and they all rated the meal a 5. I gave it a 4 but am going with the majority!   The place is casual with a classy side and has a menu that suits all occasions.  Thw service was fast and the staff very friendky. Food was high quality and fresh. I will return and will definitely recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Was so excited to try this spot out...great looking spot ..but my experience was not good. wait staff checked to see if the kitchen could make the fried oyster salad which I saw online but not on the menu that day...she said yes they could make it and my boyfriends lunch came out and then the manager came and told me they do not make fried oysters anymore...so now what did I want...besides that, my bf ordered a burger with fries and received a handful of fries that were old and not hot. They also do not validate parking and so it cost me 12$ for an hour to park in the lot next to the restaurant. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"The service was THE WORST service EVER in LIFE! We have NEVER experienced such unethical behavior ever! 

Last Saturday, from the moment we walked in to celebrate our friends' birthdays, (who both came in from out of town) the host Alvin told us it was an hour wait. It took 2 hours. We requested to be seated outside. When our table was ready, we hurried to pay for our appetizers at the bar, two women sat down at our table. When we told the host, you'd think he'd ask them to move. But he didn't. What was the point of having a pager if it's first come, first serve? We were seated inside. (Not as requested) 

He told us he'd comp our deserts as an apology. So we ordered desert. Eric, our waiter was unaware of the situation so he grabbed his manager Myles Colbert. 

Myles, was extremely disrespectful, rude and treated us like we wanted freebies. (If we did, we wouldn't have paid for our drinks and dinner.)

Myles was unapologetic about how we were treated and told us the poor experience is normal. He also kept saying, \"I'm not comping you the desert!\" 

Honestly, it wasn't about the bland deserts, it was about your host recognizing what he did was wrong and wanted to make up for it. As a manager, the professional thing to do is honor your employee's word. It's not our fault that he had no authority to do so. We find it unfair how Myles belittled Alvin and called us liars. He even insists we write a bad review on the business. His exact words were, \"let me give you my business card\".  He LITERALLY threw the card at me. 

The waiter Eric felt so bad for us and tried to pay for our deserts himself. Thank God there's still good humans out there with feelings. 

The food and drinks were okay, so don't expect too much if you decide to experience it for yourself. Expect to walk in there and get treated like a number. Then you'll be fine. 

Service as you can see was horrible. They're just so busy that they don't care. Once another trending spot opens up, they'll start to care. Since they're new in town they feel like it doesn't matter who returns and who doesn't. 
I've been a business owner for 18 years and the success of my career wouldn't exist if it weren't for my loyal clients. Retention is everything. Makes me wonder if Tom and Tyler knows how their business is operated while they're not around. I did reach out to Tyler. Hope he puts an end to it."}
{"text":"If you can manage to come here on a non-gameday, you might actually get in without a 2hr wait. The service was pretty good. Our server was very friendly. Our food came out really fast - which was great. 

The food was OK. It was really salty though. It's a great spot to hang out (the patio area). But I'll probably just come back for drinks."}
{"text":"So...I actually ended up going back the next morning for brunch and I was not disappointed! The service was outstanding again, and my salmon BLT was delicious and cooked perfectly (rare, to my request). My only suggestion would be to toast the bun or bread a little to give it some more crunch."}
{"text":"Great food!  I had the best grits I have ever had with salmon that was perfect. The waiter was very nice and efficient. The only negative was the noisy atmosphere. I would recommend this for a fun night out when you don't want to have a in depth conversation."}
{"text":"Walked in Friday at 9:30pm. Waited 5 minutes to have hostess to show up and greet us with an hour wait for 3 of us. We turned away, leaving our names but with little intention of sticking around. Door man intervened as we were leaving to tell us to just go sit at a table when someone eventually got up. That was an awkward and annoying experience overall. He assured us it wouldn't be the full wait.

We didn't go take a table, just stuck around and waited about a half hour and were seated. Gave me plenty of time to absorb the absurd decor of the restaurant. Food was fine for regular bar food, but I felt as though it was attempting to be presented in gourmet fashion. In that context, I didn't enjoy. The cocktails were excellent. 

Disorganized unprofessional experience. I like the other restaurants this group does bc they stay in their lane of 'bar food' which is where it belongs. This place has a tacky appearance and tries to be something that it's not. Good drink spot, awful food spot."}
{"text":"The huge patio area is definitely the only positive about this place. Drinks and food are overpriced; food is mediocre at best. Too many better food options in Charlotte to waste your dinner here. Go for a beer and hang out on the patio, then go somewhere else for food."}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot in a good location in uptown. Nice view! Inside is pretty cool looking, I like their style, the outside patio has a good setup too. There's a bar inside and outside. You don't have to wait to be seated outside, you may find a table open or you can kinda stand around and it's cool. DRINKS: avg price $10ish+ I tried the \"Truth Serum\" which was good, I stuck with those all night and every time I've went (been there 3 times now). It's a tequila drink, try it out if you like tequila! They do have some specials during the week, daily so check before you go. But the best one in my opinion is Monday - it's like $3 off specialty cocktails or something like that. FOOD: we didn't have a main meal there just some apps. We tried the quesadilla which was so good! And also their sliders. Good too. SERVICE: when there's a big crowd you may have to flag someone down. If your with a big group all on the same bill, there will only be one waitress for your whole group and you are only allowed to order with them. Which is kinda silly. Just a heads up for big groups!"}
{"text":"I guess this is an ok spot for drinks, but definitely not dinner. The eating area was les than 1/2 full & our waiter was not very attentive. We had to flag him down anytime we needed something. It's not what you'd expect for the price."}
{"text":"This review is for the patio area only for drinks.  There are a bunch of tables if you're dining in, but the outside bar area isn't huge if you're just coming for drinks.  There is a large first-come, first serve table that can accommodate a large group, and a nice-size wrap around bar to grab drinks.  The drinks are somewhat reasonably priced.  They don't have the largest selection of wine, but the one I was drinking was pretty good.  Bar wasn't packed, yet it was a bit slow.  The outside bar doesn't have a waitress, but they did look like they had a roped off section for drinks/private parties on the patio that did have waitress service.  Seems like a pretty cool place for a special event!

I think the best part about this place was the view overlooking the park.  I think this is a great spot to meet a friend for a drink after work in Uptown.  I would like to come back and try the food!"}
{"text":"Location location location! Outdoor patio has spectacular views overlooking the park. I love the decor and atmosphere. There is always a good crowd for happy hour since it is in walking distance to everything uptown. The drink specials and selections are also great! Ink N Ivy has an extensive menu so there are options for everyone. 

Food is fresh and service is on point. I definitely recommend this new hot spot!"}
{"text":"Overall food was very good and only $4 for the Bloody Mary bar, great deal! Chicken sandwich was fuego."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for drinks, especially because they have a huge patio that overlooks Romare Bearden Park. We have never ordered food here because their menu is very limited and doesn't have any healthy options.  They also have an inside bar and seating, which is very big, with lots of TVs, so it is a good place to watch games and you can usually get a spot near whatever game you'd like to watch."}
{"text":"This is the typical, fun when its super new but loses its \"hype\" too quickly. The food is not that great and inconsistent. If you do eat here, I highly recommend the baby lamb chops. Drinks are a miss and would suggest ordering what you feel you are happiest as your standard. The service is not great either. I always try to find the servers I know personally. It has a great terrace but in winter its terrible, its a tent, and its gloomy. I wish they would have better music after hours."}
{"text":"Erin was great! Super friendly and helpful, always there with refills and good suggestions. Salmon burger was fabulous! Cooked just right, and the aioli was perfect. Loved the fries, too. Super spot for pre-gaming."}
{"text":"Food 9/10
Service 8/10
Parking 6/10
Location 10/10
Music 9/10
TVs 9/10

Love the lamb chops/rack of lamb and the potatoes au gratin sides.  Chicken fingers my friend had were nice too!  Location and dancing are amazing.  The park view is nice.
Good place to club, watch football games or have lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Ok place, but there is nowhere to park. You have to pay to park in the same Lot the restaurant is in. Also not African Americans friendly. I went there on a Sunday the DJ was playing alot of Retro house music and when I ask if he could switch it up he said he was told to play that kind of music. No one was enjoying it but him. But then he changed the music and when the people of Color started dancing alone with everyone else one of the managers walked up to the DJ Booth and made him change it back. Nice Bar but wack ass music . will not be returning there!!!"}
{"text":"Waited for over 15 mins at our table, and nobody came to greet us. I went back and said something to the host, and again....nobody came to our table. We could see servers at a back table rolling silverware, and another one was just walking casually around. They were not busy. So, we just got up and left. Pretty disappointing because I've been looking forward to trying this place."}
{"text":"A couple of colleagues and I stumbled upon this nice little place and were attended by a nice young lady stefany, she was very prompt with the service and gave us a couple good laughs, will definitely come here again!!"}
{"text":"Gross! I frequented Ink N Ivy when they opened and loved their menu. Just went tonight and they \"revamped\" their menu. I ordered the \"Cauliflower Mac\" - Says it comes in a smoked Gouda cream...The cauliflower was completely dry with absolutely no cheese or cream to be found, basically oven baked cauliflower, we added pork belly and it was so tough you couldn't cut it with the knife. As you can see from my profile I never post anything unless it overly impresses me or completely under impresses me, so long story short it was terrible. Bring the old menu back!"}
{"text":"We showed up at 11:30am on Sunday for brunch & our party of 8 was immediately seated.  The outside patio looked nice, but we opted to sit inside.  The decor was kinda cool and interesting, & there was a Dj spinning a mixture of good music.  I ordered the chicken and waffles with a Margarita Mimoso & loved it. The drink was strong & sweet...a perfect combo! The surface parking lot in front charges $10, so we opted for deck parking for $6 across the street! I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning it was pretty crowded. I was greeted upon entering and soon seated. Despite the crowd there was no wait to get a table. The music was bumping definitely a good place to come for those who still wanna keep the party going from last night. The hostess group made several recommendations. The waiter didn't he was busy and not available. I would of been very upset if I wasn't so engulfed in my conversation and the person I was with. It took a while for the food to come out, but it was a good portion size and good food. I had the chicken and waffles which are bone out chicken strips and the waffle is light and fluffy. The omelet was noted by my friend as being good. He ate all of it or cleared his plate. This place is fun, modern and sleek. I recommend for brunch but don't expect great service do expect good food and nice decor."}
{"text":"I brought a client from the U.K. for lunch - I simply love Ink N Ivy! We were fortunate enough to get the blonde bombshell \"Upper\" Case! She made the experience! She is super enthusiastic, knowledgeable, hospitable, and genuine! The food was perfection - we actually converted him from a Brussels sprouts hater to an enthusiast! Thank you Case!"}
{"text":"This is my second time at ink and ivy and it gets better and better. This time I am just here for drinks but the drink I had was Truth Serum and it was amazing our waiter said it was a great and she didn't lie my friends said there food was great and they enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This place is an Ed Hardy shirt come to life. 

The location is great, and clearly the decor was heavily curated. I can picture it becoming a tourist spot, busy before and after sporting events but I don't see the Uptown crowd embracing Ink N Ivy for too long.

I went with a few girlfriends for lunch as a party of three. Our server was attentive and was able to answer our questions. Everything moved pretty smoothly and we were in and out in a reasonable amount of time for a weekday lunch.

The food is okay. Seems like glorified, overpriced bar food. There's nothing special about it that sets it apart from any other casual spot. I ordered the Thai Mussels (more spice than flavor) and we three ladies split the Classic Nachos with Pulled Pork. My bill came to $20 and I was still hungry by the time I got back to the office.

I'm clearly not the target market for Ink N Ivy. I'm glad we gave it a try, but with so many other great restaurants in Charlotte, I doubt I'll bother to make a second trip."}
{"text":"Food and delivery have been sub par multiple times. It's a shame with such a nice patio that this place turned out as bad as it is."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, staff are very nice, if u miss the kitchen after 12 am ! There is always nice tacos wait for u till 2am. And other stuff. \" u will never walk hungry \""}
{"text":"This place was previously Piccassos, but they remodeled the entire place. I have been anticipating their opening after walking by a month ago and at awe at the the potential. 

They have two bars, in door and out door seating, and plenty of tvs to view NFL or what ever you enjoy viewing at the bar. 

So Saturday night me and my friend visited this place, it was super packed, so very good following after opening just days ago, and they had Titos vodka on special for $5, (my favorite vodka). The bar tenders was very friendly. But the delivery of the drinks were a little slow maybe due to the amount of people. 

For food I ordered the Tuna Poke appetizer it was delicious and fun to eat. 

I would return this Sunday for NFL viewing, and to keep warm while tailgating. 

It's a must try in Uptown Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Too loud! My fiancé and I came to visit for our anniversary because we heard that the food and environment was awesome! You can't hear yourself think in this place. I enjoy music as much as the next person but if I wanted to hear music at nightclub levels at dinner I would've gone to a nightclub. The lamb is delicious, our waitress was sub-par, the fried mozzarella wasn't good, where was the cheese on the inside? I'll be more than happy to come back for a day party or something"}
{"text":"Ink N Ivy used to be both a trendy and tasty eatery. Now it is just trendy. The menu has recently changed from the large selection of restaurant quality small and large bites, to a slim selection of light pretentious options. There are limited side choices and the appetizers are unappetizing. 

BRING BACK THE OLD MENU! 

If you do find yourself there, I can only recommend the salmon sandwich."}
{"text":"Awesome spot with massive outside patio and good vibes. We had lamb burger and steak sandwich and both were awesome. Service was good and would def go back."}
{"text":"Update: After contacting the manager (at his request) he urged me to visit on a weeknight when the noise level is lower.  The noise level was the least of my issues...smh

Pro's: The decor is awesome.  Our waiter was very attentive.  The hostesses were great.  The doorman was a nice touch and very polite.  The ping pong tables were a fun touch.  

Con's: See below...

Went here to celebrate my birthday by having dinner with 4 girlfriends on Saturday night.  We arrived early (6ish) and were seated quickly.  We ordered drinks - 2 of my friends ordered Moscow Mules and they came served in glasses rather than copper mugs.  When we asked why they weren't served in copper mugs, our server informed us that they must still be dirty from the morning brunch (really??).  

Our entire table ordered the sea bass special.  The food arrived very quickly (within 20 minutes), which I was disappointed b/c I told the server to wait a while before putting our order in as we just wanted to sit and converse for a bit.  Everyone's fish was drastically different in size.  In addition, my foodie friend was convinced that the fish wasn't sea bass, but a different kind of bass, or a halibut, or something else.  The taste and texture weren't typical sea bass.  Our waiter said he went back to the kitchen to double check the fish and came back and said the chef confirmed it was sea bass.  

Our table ordered another round of drinks and again, the Mules were served in glasses.  In addition, my friend had come back from the bathroom with a piece of toilet paper stuck on her shoe (yikes!).  Our server picked it up and crumpled it up in his hand.  I saw him go and throw it away and go back to waiting on tables.  Ugh...my stomach turned!

We lingered at our table for a bit but decided to move to the outside where the volume was at a lower decibel than the incredibly loud dining area.  People were watching football and screaming, I get it...but the music was pounding at the same time and people were having to scream to hear each other.  It was annoying, but we moved on.  

Once outside, we ordered another round of drinks (this was probably at 9:00 PM) and shots.  Every mixed drink came out in a small plastic cup (less than half the size of the drinks inside - and still no copper mug).  We ordered cherrybomb shots and it was the size of a regular shot.  They mixed the vodka and redbull together and it was the tinyest thing ever.  Oh, and they had run out of Tito's vodka.  By 9PM???

We were able to get our hands on the ping pong paddles and played for a bit.  Unfortunately they didn't have paddles for the 2nd ping pong table, so we had a lot of people waiting on us to finish our time playing.  

Finally, the bartenders were incredibly rude and disrespectful.  Most of them looked like they were pissed to even be there.  

Overall, I'd like to give this place another shot.  They can only get better...I hope!"}
{"text":"We came here on a referral from another friend. All of the food is awesome!! We had the black and blue wings well done. The Bleu cheese crumble fried on top of the chicken is to die for. We also had"}
{"text":"This place is cheesy and the food (and service) sucks.   It's unfortunate because the location has major potential.   Instead they turned it into douche fest of epic proportions.   Ed Hardy, Robert Graham and Affliction shirt wearers all welcome here.   None of it is authentic.  We had a term for this in the '90s: \"poser.\"    That's what this bar is.   It tries so hard to be cool that you see right through it.    
Ultimately none of this would matter other than your paying to spend time here."}
{"text":"We were on the patio, Saturday night.  It was very busy, but our waitress, Morgan, was very attentive.  I had never had a manhattan, and our waitress suggested Angel's Envy Rye for the drink, and it was hands down one of the best drinks I've had to date. Even though there was a thick crowd of people in every walkway, she was still able to give awesome service. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE, sat for 25 minutes not being checked on, complained once to manager, then got our food cold, then asked to speak with the General Manager, and have continued to not be waited on. Absolutely worst place I have ever dined at and will not return."}
{"text":"Ok. I've given this spot a few runs

Pros: great crowd, good music, reasonably priced drinks. Nice patios. 

50/50- the food is average. What you would expect from a sceney place. If you don't like dogs, beware of the patio 

Cons: bad service. I've been a few times for drinks and 2 times for dinner.  Twice I've been and waited at least 15 minutes for a waiter to show up. This past time, I just got up and returned the menus to the hostess. I don't have time for the shenanigans and the poor management"}
{"text":"I have not had their food yet but I have had their drinks and the bartenders can really make a good drink they are very efficient. The crowd is cool, I love the outdoor patio area and I wish the parking situation was better but it's not enough to keep me away from this place."}
{"text":"I came here for Brunch on a Saturday. Very causal atmosphere, eclectic decor... Very cute place! I like this place. $3 Mimosa and the chicken and waffles were great! The Sausage gravy was on point! Seriously! Oh yea, they have a Bloody Mary bar!"}
{"text":"Friends made reservations for the 4 of us here on a weekday night.

There's a parking garage across the street and next door.

Our friends were already seated upon our arrival.  Place was rather loud and busy; seems a popular spot for happy hour.

I ordered a Poison Ivy cocktail to start.  A bit too sweet from the syrup for me, so I switched to white wine after my first cocktail.  

For appetizers we ordered a dozen oysters and the fried cheese recommended by the server.  However, server came back and said they ran out of the fried cheese.  The oysters were good.

For my entree, I had the daily special of clams & linguine.  It was average.

The weird part is when a member of our party attempted to order a beer.  The first beer he attempted, they told him they ran out.  The second beer, they said they were out of glasses.  What?
Then, they attempted to serve drinks at our table that we didn't order.  

Seems this place has some quirks to work out.

We did stay at the bar for an additional round and a snack and its festive atmosphere to do so."}
{"text":"The ambience is fabulous! But it is drafty and loud in here. Thought it would be good for our office team lunch before holiday vacations. So we called for reservations but they don't take them. We got there and they seated us within 10 min. However we waited about 45 min after ordering our food. Everyone enjoyed the taste of their choices: burgers, chicken pot pie daily special, BBQ, salmon salad, chicken wrap, etc. Only issue was our chicken pot pie special was barely warm. Waitress was fine, but then got flustered with our concerns. Then Andrew the manager checked in on us and he was awesome. He truly wanted to understand what happened and make it better. The place is still new with growing pains. Food great, decor awesome. We will be back."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time going to Ink n Ivy, and I absolutely loved it! Our waitress Paris was very sweet and knew the menu very well. I ordered the Pasta Jambalaya, and although it was spicy (as she had warned me) it was very good. I definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Used to LOVE this place. My favorite part was the jalapeño cheese sticks. However, they recently had a menu change  they're now serving jalapeño bites which are nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"Great BOOZY brunch! We came for Sunday brunch and football. There was a wait for tables so we hung out on the outdoor patio and watched the game.  They do bottles of champagne (for mimosas) for only $20 bucks each!!! so we had a few of those before heading in for brunch...There is also a bloody mary bar.

I love the decor - there is so much to look at and its all so unique yet well curated...  The crowd is very indicative of Charlotte overall - extremely diverse, young, trendy, and FRIENDLY!! We ended up being there for about 4 hours without even noticing it... LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be great. I was first taken a back by the line outside of the restaurant. I was told that's now a club...which should explain the lines. 

But the tables to eat were vacant. Clearly a overlooked issue for guest who want to be seated. 
The music was pumping the energy was great. But, no server. Literally sitting to be addressed for the most basic of things: water, bread, utensils. Nothing! 

Finally a waitress comes over and doesn't have to ask for drinks because Ive gone to the bar before she made it to me. We ordered fries, those were cold. Why the hell is there a raw bar when everyone can look over it. Gross. The Mac and Greens were good. The nachos were good. I had to ask for more cheese. ?
This just s made my head hurt all over again."}
{"text":"It is very newly opened, so of course there are some kinks to be worked out. When I arrived I was informed there was a 5-minute delay in the kitchen. No biggie..
With plenty of vacant tables, I was surprised at the 10 minutes it took to seat my party of 1 for lunch. I wasn't interested in a seat at the bar.. never heard of a 1-person lunch? Confusing..
As far as the menu.. there was nothing that screamed \"try me!\" But that could be my lack of appreciation for oysters. IMO the prices for the starters are on the high side, but such is uptown dining I guess. I planned to order the shrimp tacos, but per my server's suggestion I tried the salmon BLT instead. It was delicious!! I really enjoyed it, nice twist on a burger. I got a side of fries which were nothing special, but there was also an option to substitute so that's good. 
All in all, I would return and try other menu items, I hear that the fried oysters and the shrimp tacos are good so I want to see for myself. I also would love to see what the dinner menu has to offer."}
{"text":"I came here with 2 kids, and they sat us outside in the sun . It took them 30 minutes to bring us WATER. Another 25 minutes to take our order. This was the worse service EVER!"}
{"text":"This place has so much potential but the food is very very underwhelming. Additionally, we ordered snow crab legs and were charged for king crab legs. I would not recommend ordering food here, it's only a place for drinks and socializing."}
{"text":"The NEW Hot spot!! Move over City Lights Rooftop!! I remember walking by Ink N Ivy before the grand opening. 

The Shrimp and Grits are my personal favorite, I wouldn't pass that up! The eggs Benedict were ok. My Eggs were over cooks which bothered me. Then again it was SUPER busy that day. However no excuse. Regardless I'm still willing to give this place a chance. 

I recently seen the patio! It's stunning. Best time to visit is during the evening. You can see all the beautiful lights uptown. Also, don't forget to bring your dogs! I'm looking forward to bringing mines! 

With summer around the corner, I imagine this place will get packed!!! No they don't take reservations so arrive wicked early to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Our server only came to our table twice. Another server finally helped us and told us the first person forgot to enter our order. It is because of him that there 2 stars otherwise it would be 1"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a horrible neighbor to the residences nearby
The LOUD music echos everywhere"}
{"text":"This place is SO disrespectful to residents living in the buildings uptown. The music blares all night long on their patio. Heavy bass and rock music louder than hell. Zero respect for city curfew and makes residents absolutely hate them. Oh and their food is disgusting and service is awful on top of that."}
{"text":"Okay... Still reviewing soft opening...
Julia, so nice as a bartender and server!  Friendly and good about checking in with you.

CJ @bar so nice.  Hard for bartenders to keep up with perimeter tables.  They should have servers assigned to bar tables.

I got lucky last night & today!  I had St. Louis Ribs. Good temp, flavorful & Mac n Cheese worthwhile.  D's Lime Chicken was challenged with Pasta (not angel hair as listed and no notice of sub) & chicken at different temperatures (not warm), but good flavor.

Today for 1pm game & good brunch menu.  D again got not warm, 40-45min turn around on a pork sandwich.  So grits and sandwich not to temp but still delish.  Room for improvement but not hopeless.  The BBQ in his sandwich was better than the BBQ in my Carolina Benedict (delivered quickly and at temp). Kind of like dark, crispy vs. white, chewy.  Good flavors either way. Grits are good and hearty.  Waffle Cornbread needs sugar, but that's a regional thing.  

So, still a great experience.  Patio great, servers, hostesses, managers everybody is doing their best.  Great location.  As long as service stays positive and food is at temp... Menu, flavors & vibe are enticing.  Music note... I'd like to hear different music at noon on Sunday  than I heard at 1am on Saturday Eve."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere , great view from the patio to have a drink and see the city . The Steamed Shrimp are seasoned perfectly and the wings are great . Try the honey sriracha wings . The drinks are creative which was refreshing just not as strong as I would like . However , the service was awesome here our waitress Candace made our experience great ! Two thumbs up ! Would come back on my next visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times since it opened because I live so close. The service has been amazing every time. The food was great as well both times and the drinks are delicious! I had the poison ivy, the inkwell, and a Bloody Mary so far. The inkwell was very strong and I wouldn't recommend it, but others were great! I also had the pork quesadillas with goat cheese which were amazing! The second time I couldn't wait to try the goat cheese burger and was pretty disappointed. I'm a goat cheese fiend and you couldn't even taste it. The burger itself was really good, just wish I could've tasted the reason I ordered it. I will definitely be back to try more of the menu though as food quality is very good! However, if you go on a weekend expect it to be packed! Lunch time during the week is the least busy I've seen it. On Sunday they have a Bloody Mary bar that is amazing!"}
{"text":"Usually experience decent food, decent service, and a good crowd. Drinks are reasonably priced. I saw recently where they scored pretty low on the health score"}
{"text":"Very nice place, I consider my self to be slightly conservative.  Had a great time, music was very diverse and plenty of space.  Patio - great!
Customer service- waitress very nice.   Food - very good hot and very well displayed. Bathroom - Clean Security  - on point. Men available!"}
{"text":"Friends and I have had waiters put roofies in our drinks here multiple times. Do not go here."}
{"text":"lots of my friends have gone here so I thought why not give it a try. so I did. we ordered the shrimp tacos (app and i forgot to take a picture) and ordered the ink well drink. We were both not impressed. Based on those 2 things I wanted to give this place 3 stars and leave. But I said we had a main course and maybe we could save the review. The drink tasted just like club soda only. the shrimp tacos were very bland. we order the salmon and the goat cheese burger for a main course and OMG!!! it was so good. everything about it was good. scallop potatoes are a must. the salmon was so tender. the burger was great  (I don't eat beef but BF said it was amazing lol) So overall, I would say the vibe is nice at the place and i can see why lots of people go, just don't order apps. It was also a little pricey for my take but hey I tried it out."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and I like the energy.  The funkiness is unexpected but enjoyable, the food is put together well and the patio is amazing!  If you haven't yet tried Ink & Ivy, you should really make it your next occasion destination  :-)"}
{"text":"Tha joint caters to youngish, look at me, selfie, fake ID to thirty crowd. Wearing every thing on the color spectrum, whatever you have on, works, ROYGBIV baby!

They have patio seating out the ying-yang.  Happy hour here, on a sunny summer day is Charlotte, York Goldenblatt. The bar tending staff works hourly or on salary, so 80% are slow, 20% are tremendous, and do the CrossFitters share of the lifting . 

I ordered the Goat Cheese Burger, medium. It came out medium, and the goat cheese had the warmth & silky texture that makes you wish they made goat cheese milk shakes. The burgers other toppings work well w/ the goat cheese, the arugula, roasted tomato salsa, avocado, & chipotle aioli, serve as a mini salad. That's assuming you're super positive, and want your burger to be \"healthy.\" The bun is warm and soft, like a blanket from the dryer.

I imagine regular French fries see the herb-garlic potatoes as Poteidon; god of all potatoes and fries. These mammoth \"fries\" should be a menu item on their own."}
{"text":"Marissa did an awesome job taking care of us! Everything was timely and shes an awesome personality!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch the last weekend of January and overall we were disappointed. We all had looked at the brunch menu online only to arrive and be told they no longer off that menu anymore. Fine. So we all ordered, I got the shrimp omelette and it was a complete letdown. It had 3 jumbo shrimp in it and the rest was just egg. I've had a shrimp omelette at many places and I get shrimp in every bite. My son got a kids meal grilled cheese and fries. He got his grilled cheese but by the time he got his fries he was almost done eating. Mind you he's 4 so he wasn't eating very fast. And they were cold at that. I don't exactly remember what the others in my party ordered but none of us were impressed with our meal. It was simply underwhelming. I wish I would have checked yelp prior to going but lesson learned. We did enjoy the mimosas and will go back for those but will likely leave to go have brunch somewhere else where the food is much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Was seated promptly.  The restaurant was not busy at all. After 10 minutes and no acknowledgement from anyone, including the bartenders who were laughing and just kind of hanging out, I got up and left."}
{"text":"The customer service was good but I had a bad experiences with their food! Drinks and view are amazing!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere with great decor!  Food is amazing and drinks are good!  Perfect for any occasion whether it's a date or an event.  I really like the huge patio overlooking the park and baseball field.  Matt was my waiter and was excellent!  I couldn't have asked for better service!!"}
{"text":"So I've been twice now. Once for Saturday Brunch. It went great, I had the eggs Benedict. It was great !

Second time I went with the salmon and butternut squash ! It was seasoned to PERFECTION!!! I also ordered the Brussels and that was even better. If i could get the recipe I'd ask for it. it was delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in with some friends for a couple drinks and apps. Great atmosphere and spot to hang out after work. Our server, Marissa, did a great job keeping up with my drinking friends. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"So I went here for my birthday. I went on a Saturday at 2. The wait was about an 30min-hour for an inside table so I decided to sit in the patio while waiting. The hostess seemed unsure about the wait and they seemed frustrated. She wrote down my name and number and put it on a list.  She warned me that the kitchen was backed up and that brunch was limited. I was disappointed because I specifically came for brunch. After waiting 30 minutes I went up to check myself she said there was still a wait. I told her to take me off the list.  After sitting on the patio a few minutes a sever came over and got us drinks while we waited. I was very happy that they were so gracious even while I was waiting. The patio is very nice and the view is amazing. We sat at a patio table and we had to order lunch because they ran out of brunch. The food took about 20 minutes to come out, which I wasn't happy about. I got the oyster Po boy and a fries. My fries were cold. The sandwich was good but the baguette was way too thick. I got the $2 mimosas and a Poison Ivy to drink. Both were good! Great service but this restaurant needs help in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I gave it one star because it wouldn't let me give zero.

Where to start?  Of course this place opened with a lot of hype but I was admittedly skeptical.  I'm familiar with other \"restaurants\" from this ownership group.  They are clearly better at running a bar than a restaurant.  

Walking in the door my first impression was the decor is tacky, but it's unique so that counts for something.  It wasn't very crowded so my friend and I got a table right away.  They had an impressive looking Bloody Mary bar going, I didn't feel like making one myself so I ordered one from our server and had them make it.  It was solid, kinda hard to screw those up.

So we ordered from the brunch menu since it was early afternoon on a Saturday.  And this is about as far as we got....

After about an hour or so we told our server (who was nice and I felt bad for her) that if our food wasn't ready we were leaving.  About this time I overheard a nearby table discussing with a manager about their wait time and the food they just received was cold. 

Our sever had not returned after about another 10 mins so I left cash for my drink and we walked out.  

Wouldn't bother me a bit if this place doesn't make it.  Too many great options in this town so wasting time here again will be a hard sell for me."}
{"text":"I do NOT understand the low scores. This place is outstanding. Fabulous outdoor seating with a beautiful view of the park. Some of the best French fries I've ever had and amazing portions. I will be a regular."}
{"text":"We stopped here for brunch before a Panthers game, and I was presently surprised by both food and service!

I expected it to be packed before a home game (and it was), but we were still able to get good, fast service at a standing table by the bar. It had an awesome vibe, especially for a football pregame, and I appreciated the lively atmosphere and plethora of panthers fans. $3 mimosas also hit the spot and are on par/better than other offers in town.

The surprise here was with the food! I expected a good atmosphere and solid drinks, but my shrimp creole omelette was innovative and delicious. The creole sauce was on point, and they did not skimp on da shrimp. Would definitely recommend checking their brunch out!!"}
{"text":"The best first time in Charlotte experience! Even from the outside you could tell this place was the place to be! I loved the decor, the service was amazing (Caleb was super helpful and adorable), and every part of the meal was amazing! They had a special for mimosas where you get a bottle for $15 and some OJ (you seriously can't beat that and it was such a cool concept), the burgers were out of this world, by far the best I've ever had (get the goat cheese burger) and Caleb recommended the chocolate cake and it was perfect (super light but the right amount of chocolate), another best I've ever had. We LOVEDDDD this place, can't wait to come back in the summer and have drinks outside!"}
{"text":"Update: On 8/25/17 I returned to Ink N Ivy with an out of town guest, because of my previous experience at the restaurant. As always the atmosphere was perfect. It was a Friday night so there was pretty decent music playing, a little louder than normal which gave it more of a lounge/club feel which I enjoyed. On this particular night we had a server name Allison (per my receipt) and she was absolutely terrible and was not attentive to our needs at all. I was quite shocked by the extremely poor customer service we received on this particular night. We literally had to flag her down if we needed anything and she brought us our checks without inquiring whether or not we were ready for them. The food was also nothing like it was the first time I came, and our grits were cold.  I ordered shrimp and grits, which was quite tasty and seasoned perfectly, however as I mentioned the grits were cold. My friend had crab cakes and grits which she barely touched because she wasn't satisfied with the taste or temperature. I am not sure I would give this place another try after the experience I had last night. That is why I am changing my review from 5 to 2 stars. However, if you are looking for a trendy spot with decent music on Friday and Saturday nights, this isn't a bad choice. I just hope you receive better customer service.

Ink N Ivey is one of the best restaurants I have honestly been to in awhile. Its super cute and trendy and the customer service is outstanding!!! The genetlemen at the valet desk were nice, however the hostess could have used some work, she wasn't the most friendly but she wasn't down right rude either. We had the best bartender name Hayley, with red hair. From the time we stepped up to the counter to order a drink while we wait, all the bartenders took note of us and kept checking in to see if we were good or needed something. We ended up staying at the bar even when our table was called. My sister in law and I ordered a seafood platter which was just ok and not seasoned the best, but the presentation of the food was awesome. The food did take quite some time to come out but honestly we were drinking and talking so that wasn't too bad. The drinks are reasonably priced and honestly so is the food. The platter we got was a little pricey, but that was because it consisted of oysters, mussels, shrimp and a couple different kinds of crab legs. It was definitely a special treat. Even the servers walking around were pleasant and helpful. I will DEFINITELY go back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place during the night life.  Boy was I disappointed.  It took 30 mins for us to receive our drinks.  An hour for our food and the waitress was so rude.  We asked to speak to the manager and he was just as rude.  The chicken was so dry, our food had no flavor and the tables around us were also having issues with their food and service.  Table next to us found hair in their food.  Should I go on?"}
{"text":"The food choices for vegetarians is not great ,wouldn't go back here. They say some times can be made vegetarian but save yourself from these items."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I met some friends there for a date night! Awesome decor.. but really.. really.. really bad service. Food was ok, but don't expect a wonderful experience.. it makes me wonder if this is the first business they have owned!"}
{"text":"Went here for fight night.  Service was mostly friendly and acceptable.  The space is generous and more screens than you could possibly follow.  We didn't have any food.  Drinks were nothing extraordinary but still fine."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place, but I can't because of the staff.  I've been here three times and I have had not had anything above terrible service.  They really need to get some new staff or retrain a bunch of staff.  The staff is rude and inconsiderate.  I came here after working a 12 hours shift so I was pretty exhausted and accidentally mispronounced something (because I was so tired) and he was like \"oh maybe you need water not a drink\" in a very rude way, not a funny 'haha' way.  My friends and I all looked at each other in disbelief.  Then he comes back with our drinks and their drinks and theirs are fulls and he gives me mine with it less than 2/3 full and my friends and I were in disbelief again. So my friend and I went up to the bartender and showed her what he gave me and she was like \"so? What do you want me to do?  Remake it?\"  We said yeah because who knew what happened to the rest of my drink or what he did to it.  Then she went on to explain how we're wasting the bars money and kept saying things to make us feel bad. It was so weird. Their atmosphere is really cool though and their food is really good.  Their chicken tenders are some of my favorite, along with their honey mustard.  I'm not a huge fan of their mixed drinks though.  I hope they get new staff soon!"}
{"text":"I brought my entire extended family here and they loved it the moment they walked in.  However, the service is extremely poor.  The entire family told me that they would not come back.  Go if you're in no rush at all but otherwise, pass it up."}
{"text":"We went to Ink N Ivy not really knowing what to expect and was very pleasantly surprised. I loved the interior, very seductive. The bartenders were very knowledgeable regarding the wine selections, and the shrimp tacos were fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Visited this establishment with a friend during CIAA weekend for a day party and we had a blast!  It's a very large venue, with both indoor and outdoor areas.  The drinks were flowing, the music was awesome--DJ's inside and outside spinning new stuff as well as classics.  The crowd was comprised of mainly late 20's-late 30's folks and everyone seemed to be having a great time.  I would definitely come back for another event!"}
{"text":"This was my second time going here for brunch and at this point I'm just convinced the food isn't good. If you want something basic, you'll be fine but don't expect a lot of flavor. The best part is the specials on the bottles of champagne but at this point I don't think it'll keep me coming back. The wait staff is ok, some of them are really nice and welcoming...others aren't. Overall I'd go back for the mimosa specials but I'm likely to eat before I go."}
{"text":"The wait is ridiculous. They tell you they're \"at capacity\" when they have an EMPTY dining room/bar area inside. Their staff just can't keep up with the bar volume. Not sure I understand the hoopla, I've been disappointed every single time I come. 

Wouldn't recommend to anyone I know!"}
{"text":"It a dance club, ,sports bar and a won't to be restaurant, toke 20 minutes to get a drink and we sat at the bar???? It's the same food this chain services at every restaurant, just a different name, the person shucking oysters should know better not to chew gum with his mouth open, no thanks oysters, shrimp tacos had  no flavor and the salsa had no flavor, the oyster salad, oysters were so over fried they were dry??? Oh the 8 pecans made the salad, ask for no onions, guess what got them, just another flash restaurant in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Great place to go in uptown. I've been about 2 times for brunch and it was sooo good. The food is great! Only the weekends they have a Bloody Mary bar and $3 mimosas that are so good. The view is great and the location is perfect."}
{"text":"Positives: Our waitress was super sweet and they have good $2 mimosas and a great Bloody Mary bar ($4) on Saturdays. Strong mimosas and bloody Mary's- great drinks for the price.  

Negatives: the food came out cold. Then cold again the second time. Restaurant ended up covering it all because of all the problems and how long it took. Food was flavorful but honestly just ice cold, like it had been sitting out for awhile. Managers and staff apologized, which was really thoughtful. since the place is new, they are really just struggling with the fine details. 

*Atmosphere was cool. Probably a good place to watch the game and get a drink but don't get food there unless you want to wait forever and eat it cold."}
{"text":"I started a meetup and chose Ink & Ivy for the meet and greet. For some reason they do not take reservations, not even for large parties. I got there early and put my name on the list to secure a table. The strategy worked. Unfortunately the food was pretty bad. Not one of my guests enjoyed their meal. The food was burnt, dry and flavorless. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Mehhhh...was not impressed.  Ordered the crab cakes Benedict.  Which was ok...lacked flavor.  Grits were like pudding in texture.  Husband ordered the ham omelet with potatoes. Potatoes were good, but that omelette was a joke.  Thin, cold and had nothing in it.  Very disappointing. 

Bloody Mary bar was good.  $4 ...can't beat that price!"}
{"text":"This clt location is cute and quaint. I really love the decore by using both masculine and feminine. Its located next to a park and baseball stadium. I loved the size of the location. While I was there they accommodated 2 birthday parties and the bar was lit. However, the food was lacking. I ordered a basic burger with fries. The burger was lacking in depth and flavor. I was shocked to see that there was no seasoning. In addition the burger was room temp. I was severly disapointed. My friend ordered the brunch salmon and breakfast potatos of which both were dry and also lacked flavor. 

My waitress was sweat though."}
{"text":"This place is a good spot for a quick lunch. I recommend sitting at the bar and ordering off of the specials menu, if you do not it might not be less than an hour to get your food. I have been multiple times for lunch and I do enjoy their fried chicken special on Mondays (when it is not over done) and their shrimp and grits on Wednesday is also quite good. They add in peppers which is lovely. They are pretty creative with their drink specials as well, which I can appreciate. 

I have only been here once after hours for drinks and to socialize. We enjoyed it but the service was not great, they brought the wrong wine, and it took a while for them to get us our appetizers. When I let the waitress know that the wine was incorrect she huffed and puffed as if it were my fault she brought the wrong type of wine, which was frustrating. 

The ambiance is neat and I appreciate the decor. Overall, not my top choice to go to for a bar scene, it is pricey and the service is spotty but for a quick lunch it is a good spot."}
{"text":"I went to this place for brunch last week and I must say it was pretty great. The food was really good and the ambience is great and ideal for something nice without being too fancy. They have a DJ that plays throughout the day and the music selection was on point for the atmosphere. My server was really attentive and offered really good service. I must say that my favorite was the cheese sticks. I really enjoyed this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Charlotte! Great city views and one of the best outdoor drinking spots around. This place is always packed! The food is good, slightly pricy for what you get but not bad. The oysters and shrimp were worth it. Great spot for causal drinks after work or a good place to stop on a night out. Plenty of room to sit and relax or play ping pong!"}
{"text":"I liked this place from the time I hit the door. Actually, before. While dropping my car off with valet, he let me know there was an hour and a half wait. I had reservations, but it was smart to inform me to save everyone time.

Despite having reservations, the wait was still longer than anticipated. I was here for a birthday party and decor was provided, which the restaurant gave no fuss about putting out in the manner prescribed by the birthday dinner hostess. The only issue with service is they kept calling us \"sweetie\". A little petty, but this is not okay. 

The downside was food. I had nachos and they were luke warm. So were the fried oysters on my friend's salad. Aside from mussels, nothing was particularly tasty. Much room for improvement with food.

The best part of Ink N Ivy were the intangibles. It has an overall good vibe. The venue is VERY large. Great place for a big party. There was a also a mixed crowd, old... young... all races & religions. Background music was a upbeat pop from the 99 and the 2000s. I would come back by here to hang out. It surely is an amazing happy hour spot. If you're starving, choose elsewhere. If you're ready to be social, Ink n Ivy is the way to go."}
{"text":"I came to Ink N Ivy the first time just for a drink, but went for brunch this past Sunday. I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be by the food, but instead by the view and the outside seating. 

During the week; the drinks are amazing (a little pricey) but are equal parts unique and delicious. The food is okay, not as good as I was expecting but I didn't completely hate it. I had the \"sweet Thai chili\" sauce on my first visit and was obsessed. 

Brunch however, was not the best. Myself and my friends love brunch. Half price mimosas and new food is our favorite. But I'd say out of 100& enjoying the food, we maybe 60% really loved it. I had a lunch item (Steak sandwich) and it was okay. They had the Chicken and waffles and WHY DO YOU PUT A BONE IN CHICKEN NEXT TO A STACK OF WAFFLES. I understand food art but I mean really why. The sausage/maple gravy sauce was boss though. Also, cool bloody mary bar.

All in all, It's a great spot to hang outside with friends. They have great seating, cool chairs and insta-worthy spots everywhere. 

I won't be going back for the food, just those 2 dollar mimosas and the views."}
{"text":"Living in uptown, literally across the street from this place, I was highly anticipating it's opening. I've been here a couple of times  from their opening week until now and after a couple of visits, I am definitely now set on my review. Pros: music is good (great ambience if you like a lively crowd with good top hits), they have nfl ticket, great modern decor n outdoor area. Cons: Their food is mediocre and overpriced... I've ordered several times and they have  gotten my order wrong multiple times. The food runners don't seem to know where they are going with their food, often running around dropping plates off at the wrong tables ( I've had to send back my food back twice), servers appear to not be well trained as they kept forgetting to ask certain questions during food orders and forgot to place several drink orders, my food came out cold, I've also had drinks charged at a different price than was in the menu, and after all this trouble during my last visit we didn't have any management come and address us or take anything off our check. I've been a server for 7 years and understand that new restaurants have to work out their kinks, however after several weeks this restaurant still needs to work on quality of food and training their servers and food runproperly.  Overall ordering food here is more of a pain then it is pleasurable.... Come here for drinks at most!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, messed up orders, nice decor.  

I ordered the mussels - they were great, but they gave only two small toast points to dip in the sauce.  Everyone knows that the best part of the mussels is dipping into the sauce.  When I asked for more bread, it look 15 minutes to get more bread.

The rest of the food was fine, but nothing special.  Several in our party got food that was wrong or cold and then it took too long to get it back.  

I won't be back, except maybe to grab a drink and watch a game - the place is huge!"}
{"text":"This was previously deleted so I'll repost.  

We had previously gone to Ink 'n Ivy and had a delicious brunch, so we were looking forward to having dinner there. We had a group of 9 people and it was a disaster from the beginning. 

1) We were seated around 8:15PM with no silverware.
2) We proceeded to order a bottle of wine. We were told there was only 1 bottle of Sauvignon Blanc left so it would be a few minutes while they chilled it. We waited ONE HOUR. Meanwhile, we walked up to the bar to order a bottle of wine and got a bottle immediately in a bucket of ice. We shared this information with the Manager.
3) We all ordered appetizers and asked for plates and silverware. We never received them, so we ate the food with our fingers.
4) When it came to the entrees, half of the table got their entrees 30 minutes before the other half of the table.
5) I ordered grilled salmon. Initially they brought out my order and it was incorrect. They realized this before putting it on the table and took it back.
6) 30 minutes later the grilled salmon was served. I cut into it and it was raw in the center. I walked up to the manager with the salmon, showed him the salmon, and he shared that this was the correct way to cook the salmon. I asked him to cook it for longer. He was incredibly rude when speaking to me.
7) After paying the bill, I finally got my salmon back.

The entire dinner took nearly 3 hours from the time we were seated to us leaving. We expressed our concerns to both the waitress and the manager. They did comp a bottle of wine for the table and a few entrees which was nice. However, the experience was very disappointing as we were celebrating a friend's birthday. I would not recommend this restaurant unless they improve their service."}
{"text":"Happy to see this place open and up for business! Went the first week they were open and service was a little longer (due to opening week). On my second visit food, service and drinks were great! Thought the pricing was great especially for the location."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time and I LOVED it. Haliey was our server and she was great. Super friendly and very sweet. The GM Steven stopped by to check on us... very very beautiful place"}
{"text":"Went for brunch today expecting greatness because of all of the talk about this place....I was so disappointed. The interior was nice and had a very chill vibe. The mimosas were warm. I ordered the cauliflower sandwich that comes with no flavor, no sauce, on a dry hoagie. I asked for a to go box and was told they only had tiny boxes so I had to cut food up for multiple boxes and then I see another server passing out large boxes at another table. My bf has been waiting to go here and today I had to deliver the bad news that it is not worth it"}
{"text":"Wasn't a huge fan- the Caesar salad they thought me was not crisp at all and lacked flavor. It's hard to mess up a Caesar salad in my opinion, so I was pretty disappointed. They also messed up someone in my party's order and she had to wait for her meal while everyone else ate (pretty frustrating for the work lunch crowd). I'd probably give it another shot at night because I've heard it's a fun atmosphere with good drinks, but I wasn't a fan for lunch."}
{"text":"Great Sunday Brunch! Lively atmosphere, great food, and cheap mimosas. 
Will go back and add this into our brunch rotation."}
{"text":"I went to Ink N Ivy for a work event on a Friday, and I must say the staff did a great job of accommodating our large group of more than 100. We had a roped off area outside, food, and plenty of staff dedicated to helping just us. The staff were attentive and quick. The food was surprisingly delicious!! They had AWESOME chunky guacamole, which I was not expecting. We also had meatballs (packed with flavor and moist), sliders, and caprese salad skewers (fresh and delicious). I was super impressed with the food.

The space is decorated in black, green, and purple so the decor is bolder than most Charlotte bars. The music gets louder as the afternoon and evening goes on. Our event ended at 7, but many of us stuck around after the event, and the place was packed by 9. The crowd seemed to mostly be drinking, but we did see some guests eating inside. 

Ink N Ivy is not really my scene, so I don't think this is a place I'll frequent, but I did really enjoy spending and afternoon on their patio. Their waitstaff were great and they were well suited to handle our large group effortlessly."}
{"text":"When in Charlotte kinda place.... they have a really cool trendy, chic, atmosphere with a diverse menu and raw bar.  This is the kinda place you can get oysters or jambalaya.  We were here when it wasn't busy so we had great service but I've heard it can get insane.  I'd say top 20 trendiest place in Uptown  aka Downtown ."}
{"text":"Very interesting interior, love the large patio. Our service has been hit or miss. Only tried a few food items, no complaints, but nothing I LOVED. The cocktails are what brings me back (Poison Ivy is a must try)! Good TV set up for games. Will be great for summer, baseball and football season!"}
{"text":"I came to Ink and Ivy for Wine Down Wednesday's. The first experience was pleasant. The wine was wonderful and the price made it even better. I also ordered the Salmon Sandwich and it was delicious. The salmon was cooked and seasoned perfectly. As my friends and I were leaving it started to rain really hard so we decided to stay and get more drinks. The 2nd experience started off not so good. The host and a server acknowledged that there was some tables available but was told us a 20 min wait would be needed. So my friends and I proceeded to the bar to wait. Immediately after walking away from the front and placing an order for drinks, our table was ready. We sat in the corner near the front windows and it was very hot! There was flies flying around and I wasn't a fan. I decided to order a dessert and ordered the cheesecake. I was brought a key lime pie. I made the server aware and she brought me back a cheesecake. This was not a homemade cheesecake. Definitely tasted like a frozen cheesecake from the grocery store. I won't be getting dessert here again."}
{"text":"Nooooooo. We were far from impressed by this place and then find out they ended up on the \"bad report card\" for an awful sanitation score. In addition, we live across the park from this place. We were so excited about a new restaurant and hang out opening up and then find out this place is a dump, bad food, awful drinks and they ignore the numerous noise complaints. We hear their music on the 18th floor a block away. Wouldn't be as big of a deal if it was a decent place to eat, but eew. Seriously, look up their sanitation information on the news websites."}
{"text":"What a hot spot for happy hour on a Wednesday!  Unfortunately this bar/restaurant is not prepared and cannot handle crowds.  We had 14 people at two tables and it took 35 minutes to get our drinks. Think about that...how does a bar make money when it takes 35 minutes to serve drinks.  After 30 minutes the manager came over to apologize that they were out of wine glasses but never acknowledged the insane wait time.  We ended up drinking wine from highball glasses and the manager bought the round but by that time half our party had to leave to pick up kids and the other half were so frustrated with the poor service.  Total fail on a nice coworker happy hour. Too many other places with better service to choose."}
{"text":"We had lunch today and I found the food to be uninspired, amateurish and forgettable. The Monday fried chicken special: chicken batter was salty and awful, mash potatoes tasteless save the aftertaste of burnt garlic and my wife's BLT looked like something I would make for her...thick pieces of white bread unenthusiastically toasted. I would say definitely not go there for the food. Perhaps the bar and open patio would be great for socialization and game days. Prices were ok and serving staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Bloody marry bar. Either the best or the worst in Charlotte. Depends on the day.  Just please get it 100% every weekend. When you have na entire table no happy because you ran out of mixer and horse radish at 11:15, I think that is a problem. Let me know when it's fixed cause when it's on point it's the best in the city."}
{"text":"Great drinks. Skip the food unless it's nachos! Go for drinks and the patio! 
During the summer the patio is awesome."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible. It took 8 minutes to be greeted. Once greeted we ordered two appetizers and three drinks. Our two appetizers came our first then 5 mins later our drinks came. I would hardly call them craft cocktails. They muddled blackberries, club soda and vodka. The worst part? They didn't strain the drink, so every sip out of a pint class(??) was straight up seeds. Highly unimpressed. The only good part? Their patio view, but I won't be back. The view isn't worth the disappointment of service, food and drinks."}
{"text":"Terrible! Such bad service! Legit only nice person working there was the manager. Everyone else was beyond rude!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and as soon as we walked in we were greeted by a hostess that acted like she couldn't care less that we would like to be seated. She informed us that it would be 25 minutes until we could be seated outside. We gave our number then proceeded outside to grab a drink and wait for our table. 45 minutes later with only a few tables actually seated, I walked back in and the hostess informed me she could seat me at an empty table, but we couldn't be waited on because the server for the shift wasn't present yet. We agreed to just be sat at that point. We sat down in a corner table outside when another server came to try to give us water when the manager stopped her to say she can't serve us. I went back in to say that we could sit inside if necessary, where I overheard the manager and hostess saying we were being \"picky\" about our seating. At that point we felt as though we were an inconvenience and we'd get adequate service at another institution that would like our business."}
{"text":"delicious food and nice service. the red potatoes, shrimp tacos and crab cakes were great."}
{"text":"Happy birthday to me. Birthday brunch at Ink N Ivy was the best choice I made to ring in my new year. 

Though it was Super Bowl weekend and a Saturday maybe CLT isn't big into the brunch scene? There were so many open tables at Ink N Ivy I was floored because the service was impeccable, the food was phenomenal, and the drinks were spot on. 

I made a reservation, thinking this place would be swamped, but I still suggest the reservation - it's never bad to have. Because it was February we didn't sit outside, but next time I'm at Ink N Ivy I will absolutely be partaking in the patio seating!

I'm surprised that the options aren';t on the same page with Ink N Ivy becuase it was such a hit for me."}
{"text":"After an event Uptown, some friends and I decided to check out Ink N Ivy for a cocktail and some appetizers.
We arrived around 8:00 and were able to grab a few seats at the bar. We ordered a few cocktails and two appetizers. The cocktails were pretty good, unfortunately I cannot remember the one I had but I loved it. 
We ordered the calamari and crispy potatoes to much on, of which both were just okay.
The layout is cool, but definitely a very loud atmosphere. Don't plan to have a quiet evening or date night here."}
{"text":"The worst service in Uptown. My party and I were ignored and were essentially forced to leave due to the rude staff's organized effort to ignore us. It was unbelievable. I've never experienced anything like it in my life."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved our food ! Service was great too. The only thing was that my fiancé ordered the fried shrimp sand which and there were only 5 shrimp with too much and too hard of bread. The shrimp itself was awesome though."}
{"text":"Experienced terrible service from the moment we sat down. The server was nice but it took about 5 minutes to be greeted when we joined some friends.  They failed to bring us silverware, no water refills and  food took 30+ minutes to arrive. I ordered a French onion soup and it took 30min.  When it finally arrived it was cold with hard crumbly cheese. Not an ideal way to spend your Saturday afternoon. Great location and patio but the service and kitchen needs to be stepped up."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is good. Ambiance annoys me with how the music is all over the place. I'll definitely try it again someday and see if they've figured out what music ambiance they've decided they want to be."}
{"text":"Tried for zero stars but that's not allowed. Really wanted to try this place out. But no on-line reservation system -- and after several tries to get through by phone (lots of unanswered ringing, during business hours), learned they do not take reservations. Explanation unclear, something about the restaurant being \"so big\" that it wouldn't work.  Was told that arriving at 6:00 \"you'll be fine.\" Pressed a bit, she amended that to, \"You shouldn't have to wait more than 30 minutes.\"  Hmm.  When you have 8:00 performance tickets, that doesn't work. Restaurants -- even hip ones that have created an \"excited buzz\" around themselves -- need to be more considerate of customers' needs and schedules. And so we'll be spending our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came to the establishment. It was crowded outside because of the games going on. So we decided to go in and check it out. The beer specials were good $3 bud light and Dos Equis at Vine. We reserved for a table. It was about a 45 min wait but okay because the atmosphere was great. However, once we got seated, a whole other story. We've been sitting for 20 min until finally someone came to our table. Very disappointed. Sorry I could o let take a pic of the menu because that's all we got. Highly disappointed"}
{"text":"Nice decor inside. Purchased a to go order - chicken salad wrap with fries.  It was ok - disappointed with the fries, very hard and cold.  Not impressed. They were like eating potato chips."}
{"text":"Tried Ink N Ivy over the weekend for brunch and was so excited about visiting this new spot. The decor is really unique and different, which I appreciated. The restaurant is very big and open, but I felt like the decor did not match what was going on inside. It's this cool trendy decor but there were TVs everywhere with labels for which sports games would be shown and there was a DJ playing club music... all of this was happening during Sunday brunch. Definitely a bizarre combination of things.

Anyway, I ordered off the brunch menu and was really pleased with my selection. I had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was excellent and my waffles were pretty typical waffles. I was full afterwards and they were delicious. My suggestion is to serve 100% pure maple syrup with meals as opposed to the high fructose corn sugar syrup. For an upscale restaurant uptown, I was expecting real syrup.

I also ordered a cocktail - it was a berry drink with limencello... yummm. It had real crushed strawberries and excellent fruit flavor. It was also pretty strong, which is good. I loved that. 

My total bill was around $25 including tip (and I always tip at least 20%). This is good for a drink and a full meal. 

I will definitely be back to Ink N Ivy. I think they're still trying to work out some of the \"new\" kinks as well as communication among staff. I do recommend giving it a go, as the food and drinks were delicious."}
{"text":"Such attentive bartenders. Fun conversation, great job with name recognition to make everyone feel important. Hoping to make a stop back by on this trip. I only had wine but the food looked divine. The DJ had some fun hip hop tracks going all night."}
{"text":"Awesome bar layout and atmosphere, but our wait staff was terrible. Forgot our silverware 3 times. Forgot our water twice. Brought out the wrong food then proceeded to take the shrimp off the wrong plate and transfer it to the correct one only to have my friend bite into it and discover there was still goat cheese on it...which she is allergic to. 

Two different waiters. One actually made the comment \"ugh I'm so sorry, this is why I don't wait anymore.\" 

I had to send my plate back because the lettuce was the bottom of the romaine and turning brown. Chicken was awful as well. 

I expected way more from this place. Don't eat here. Come for the night life."}
{"text":"First time experience. Erin was our server and she  was outstanding. The jambalaya pasta was excellent, though a ton of food. Crab cakes were also excellent. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Second night serving food overall a very solid opening. High scores around the quality and taste of the food along with the service once seated was very nice. Areas of improvement which are to be expected with popularity and it being the first weekend are the waiting times to be seated ranged from 45mins to 2 hours depending on group size. Ambience outside by the bar was very nice. Inside setting and atmosphere was very nice the food ordered was quick to be severed.  Appetizers were quesadillas and honey siracha wings were were both very impressive. Main entrées fillet mignon one serve well & other medium well along with lumb fresh crab cakes and potatoes. Drinks were an apple martini without the cherry and a crown and ginger. They were small areas of improvement but that's what to be expected when it's your second night being open; but overall the food was very tasty and the atmosphere lively with a large crowd."}
{"text":"I was in town for work and a large group of us decided to visit Ink N Ivy.
We were a bit concerned considering we had a group of 16 and they do not accept reservations.

When we walked in we were told the wait would be very long, but then the manager saw our large group and leaped into action - accommodating us on the patio with a massive collection of tables. It was greatly appreciated and a very pleasant surprise/first impression.

Our group was taken care of all evening - the drinks were flowing, the food was good and nobody had an incorrect order. Impressive!

My only complain would be with the dish I ordered - the crabcakes. They were very runny/smooshy for crabcakes. I expected a bit of a crisper crust on the top and bottom and more of a solid/flakey consistency from the crab. This felt more like a soup ball? Either way, it tasted fairly good.

I'm a much bigger fan of this Charlotte location than I am the Charleston one. I'd visit again if in town for work - especially for the cocktails!"}
{"text":"Well im more so a fan of the artwork on the walls here at ink n ivy. Goes well with the name. Came here plenty times before but never for brunch. I was a little disappointed in the brunch menu for there was not much to offer for brunch choices. My calamari was a bit chewy, and my drink was blah. Unless they change the brunch menu up a little ill just stick to coming to ink n ivy for lunch or dinner like i have since they have been open, much better selections for dinner and lunch."}
{"text":"Came in for a few drinks the other night and it was a good 10 mins before our server came to the table. After checking out the menus we looked over and saw all the servers just standing and talking over by the drink station. She hurried over once she saw us looking, though. 

 LOVE the atmosphere-it's definitely a hip after-work spot, but it's SUPER loud. I don't think I'd come here with my family, but I might come and check out the brunch special."}
{"text":"I have been to this bar multiple times and came to watch the Panthers game. We just left and had great service at the bar for the game but when we left apparently the entrance is different than the exit. The door guy called us ****ing stupid and I did not appreciate it. There was no one coming in the entrance and no one told us not to use the entrance to exit. I really did not appreciate being called ****ing stupid on the street by the staff and will never go back."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here. I was a little skeptical about not being able to place a reservation but the wait wasn't long. Really enjoyed my visit and food. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Food was merely... O'kay. Bar service was up to par; Table service was mediocre. Pork belly sliders were the worst I've had - Tough and faty! Plus we asked for our sodas to-go and they told us they do not supply to go cups. Really?! We wouldn't ever return. The scene overall is nice and unique.. only thing worth the while."}
{"text":"Just don't get the hype about InkIvy.  Big letdown; not very clean, food only mediocre, music is just noise, clientele a bit trampy.  No talent from the kitchen, none from the dj, bartenders quite rude.  Move on from this place."}
{"text":"I stopped by after work to meet some friends for drinks. They have a great outdoor area. The open view of the park was a very good venue to just sit and hang out. We arrived at 5 and thus were able to get a table along the edge of the area, overlooking the park. The place was pretty busy, but not so packed that it was overwhelmed. Our waitress was very attentive. The design of the outside is unique as well. They also have $4 draft beer on Thursdays. Wicked Weed Pernicious on Draft! I highly recommend for drinks, hope eat there soon."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere but staff must get it together. Very slow service, aloof management and mediocre food. Your location and ambiance is keeping you afloat."}
{"text":"The wait time here was insane.. well over an hour and a half for 4 people. I waited because the outdoor seating and bar area was nice. Once we got to the table, it took a long time to see the server and even longer to order a drink. The mozzarella sticks were really good and presentation was great.. the service was a let down. I wasn't asked if I needed anything, if I wanted another drink.. and had to remind the server about the drink I was waiting for. Big let down. Not sure I would spend my money here again when uptown is booming with places that are attentive or at least say sorry when things aren't going as planned. A little honesty goes a long way.. ignoring the obvious doesn't."}
{"text":"This looks like a cool place and the menu looks like something I'd like to try. Unfortunately, I can't confirm- we sat the bar, bar was only semi-busy, bartender and bar-back passed by us several times without acknowledging us. We watched her refill several people's drinks, still nothing in our direction.  Too many good bars and restaurants in the area for this. Think my rating is harsh? Look at my other ratings-pretty much all 4's and 5's."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I have received in Uptown, to date. A couple coworkers and I are constantly on the search for lunch joints that are convenient, with decent food (we keep our expectations realistic) and timely service. After being consistently underwhelmed here, we talked ourselves back into lunch today. Food took forever, and came out cold. The server only came by once in an hour long period (the manager took our drink order and food runners brought the food). We repeatedly asked for our checks from the server AND floor manager long after we had finished our meals and they both kept saying okay, and never returning. We sat with empty glasses and plates in front of us for 45 minutes. We understand it was lunch hour rush, but every table around us had come, eaten and left within an hour, like a typical uptown lunch should be. Lunch shamefully took almost 2 hours today, with almost an hour spent waiting for our checks.

The only saving grace here is the trendy ambiance. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went here before the Eagles V Panthers Thursday night game.
The place was mobbed - packed!!
In spite of the out of control busy crowd they managed to keep the tunes pumping and the place hopping!

It is an easy walk to BofA and a fun and energetic atmosphere."}
{"text":"The decor is eye-catching from the time that you walk in the door! To be located uptown, the prices are reasonable... if you don't plan on drinking. For my food and a couple of martinis, I was pushing about $45. However, if you want to grab a bite before a night out then this place turns into a lounge with a DJ after 10:30pm or so. So the $45 would actually be the cost of club hopping if you went to multiple spots uptown. 

Overall, I think this spot is a cool addition to the Charlotte nightlife. Not to mention, the Shrimp and Grits are AMAZING!!"}
