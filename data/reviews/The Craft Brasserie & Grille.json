{"text":"Never have to wait for a seat here, yet it's always buzzing with people. Obviously really great drink selection. Food is unique and delicious. I'm glad they change it up every now and then. Brunch is fantastic too! Great option if you're in liberty village where it can get way too busy and you're left waiting ages for a table."}
{"text":"3 stars for an excellent beer selection. 

Food is mediocre. Burgers are small and they charge for fries which were also a small portion. 

Overall a good place if you want a beer but it's not a destination for food."}
{"text":"I've been to The Craft on two separate occasions now and it definitely has a lot of potential but there are a few issues they still need to work out.

First off I have to say that I love the look and feel of this place, as well as how they've organized the beer menu. My favourite part so far is the beer flights - $10.50 for four 5oz pours is a great deal and lets you explore the menu without having to commit too much to a beer you've never tried before.

Both servers I've had were wonderful and friendly, but not at all knowledgeable in the beers they serve. This place just opened up so it's understandable that the staff isn't well educated yet, but I hope it's something that will be addressed through training. 

The speed of service seems to be hit or miss. The first time I was here the service was pretty quick and consistent. However, the second time I came in I waited almost 30 minutes for my first drink. Both times I visited were on a Friday night and moderately busy but not enough to justify that kind of wait time. Throughout the night the wait for a drink seemed to vary between 5-15 minutes, which probably would've been okay if the beers that came out were actually what we ordered. 

More often than not, more than one of the beers that we ordered in a flight were the wrong beer from the right brewery, wrong brewery and wrong beer, or right beer but in the wrong spot (the beer names are written on the flight). Honestly the accuracy was roughly 50% over the course of the night, which is pretty bad. I'm not sure where the miscommunication was - with our server or with the bar - but luckily our server was always more than happy to go back to the bar to get the right beer and was very apologetic about the whole thing. 

I haven't actually tried the food yet but friends who did had mixed reviews. Two friends had the burger and really enjoyed it. Another friend ordered the garlic fries and was sent out regular old french fries, which was disappointing because I was really looking forward to trying them. 

I'll definitely be back over the next few weeks to try the food for myself and see how this place develops, I just hope they are able to work out some of the existing issues sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"ordered the \"cuban stack\" to go for lunch.
it was a sad sandwich, the roasted pork was dry. 
the swiss cheese looked like someone started to melt it then decided not to."}
{"text":"Went for food and beers on a Saturday night. Food was terrible. Service was at a snails pace."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, but food service needs a lot of improvement.  We happened upon this place on our way home from a TFC match and we're very happy with the section and quality of beers.  After waiting what seemed a long time for our food, the witness informed us that our food was accidentally sent to another table.  I can under at and a mixup with a new restaurant, but we weren't offered anything for the delay and mixup - other than a 'sorry'.  Empanadas were also disappointing when they arrived.... pastry was too sweet and seemed more suited to a desert."}
{"text":"Sucks.

Food. Mediocre.  Pub food. If it wasn't for their extensive beer selection they would have no redeeming quality. 

Service. Waitress asks the 2 people in front of me what they want to drink and then walls aways and never comes back to ask for my drink order. We are the only table she is serving! 

Been there twice and it sucked both times."}
{"text":"Great wings, succulent sliders, comfortable seating, we could hear each other talk without raising our voices or sharing ohmygodcanyoubelieveit, 3-exclamation-mark self reflections with folks at the next table - a rare find considering the Liberty Village dining/drinking scene. I'll choose it over the local competition, more mature, more personal, warm welcome, attentive service, convivial relaxed vibe. I loved watching self-selection at work: watching posing, self-centered types in aviator sunglasses and curated stubble and duck faces come in, decide it's not for them and scamper off to breathlessly inform others of their importance . BTW, an entirely serviceable house white (Ont chard, IIRC). Honest VFM proposition with some big bold beautiful flavours, I shall return."}
{"text":"The is great place to have some beer with friends but I can't say I'd recommend planning dinner here. The menu looks really well done, but the food itself was not impressive. The forest burger was garnished very well, but the meat itself was under seasoned and a little dry. The fries were great. I shared the white chocolate macadamia brownie with a friend, which our server raved about. It was horrible. I don't even understand how it's possible to mess up a brownie that bad. I don't know if it was the recipe or maybe the use of spoiled ingredients but it was actually inedible. The restaurant did offer to remove it from the bill, which I should have taken them up on. I don't know if maybe it was just an off night but I probably won't be eating here again. I'm giving this place 3 stars because it's a fun place to hangout and have a drink."}
{"text":"Great selection with a wonderful menu that describes each beer.Made decisions much easier then the normal guessing.  Food was also very good.  Only complaint was it was a bit loud.. But it's bar"}
{"text":"The beer was tasty but the portions were crap and the service was slow. Won't be coming back..."}
{"text":"This place has a great environment, great service, and no doubt the best beer list in the neighbourhood. On top of that, they have reasonably priced flights and happy hour drink specials."}
{"text":"Was too loud to easily carry on a conversation with my friends at the table. Lots of seating with nice big comfy booths and the washrooms were very nice.
For health reasons I don't drink, but my beer loving dining companions seemed to like it, though one felt it was too much choice.
The food was overpriced and average, the menu said there'd be bacon in my dish, but I didn't find any.
The waitress seemed annoyed at having to talk to people, but another who wasn't our waitress kept trying to bring us other peoples orders."}
{"text":"Great beer and cider specials during the week. 
I suggest staying away from the caesars as they seem to be made of 50% clam juice. 

Good menu overall - the Korean wings were good. The beef sliders were good. The chicken sliders are mediocre. Good fries. Best quinoa salad I've had in a while.

Cheers"}
{"text":"The beer selection here is fantastic! Food menu looked interesting but we did not come in for food this day. The place is large and appeared to accommodate larger groups (6-8 people). Definitely come here if you like craft beer. They let you design your own flight which is a nice bonus!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the food - if you want to go for a drink, they have a lot of options and pretty good drink deals.

But the food is just not good. I live in the area so I was really excited about another place opening up. So far I have eaten there 3-4 times with friends and none of us have enjoyed our meals. There has never been problems with health related concerns like undercooked meat or anything serious, but things are just bland (especially the burgers/sliders) or overly salty, or what they mix together is creative but doesn't taste good together. With other great places in the area and surrounding neighbourhoods I would recommend coming here for a drink and having dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"My go-to pub in Liberty Village. Delicious food, a bit over priced but delicious. Their variety of beer is overwhelming but the servers always know what to recommend. I've had their beer flights on a few occasions and always enjoy. Huge place so you always find a table and a good atmosphere too."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about all the new style restaurants that are opening in Toronto that have TERRIBLE service but its clearly an epidemic. Once again, our server completely disappeared for a good portion of our meal. One major misconception I think servers have is that once you bring the main courses, this is a good time to go on break. FALSE, its not. Immediately after being served our dishes our table was overcome with the smell of seafood. My eating mates shrimp tacos were made with shrimp that was apparently caught in California, and shipped to Toronto. That shit was OLD. She took it off the bill which was cool but had she checked on us shortly after serving us, she would have given my friend a chance to order something else before the rest of us were done eating. but she didn't, so my friend left hungry and certain we have no need to return to craft.

add it to the list of overly hyped, pretentious 'brasseries' in Toronto."}
{"text":"Boring and below average. In a pseudo basement that's decently well decorated. Food didn't seem to know what it wanted to be. I think the goal was business casual bar food. The best part of the whole experience was the blue jays winning."}
{"text":"We came for brunch because our other choice was full. At first we where nervous because it wasn't full but we where pleasantly surprised. The menu is limited but what they do is done well. The staff are pleasant and helpful. We will be back."}
{"text":"Liberty Village get's a new Craft Beer focused restaurant serving 120 beers on tap... how can you hate on this place? Seems like some folks gotta remember the fact that being new comes with it's fair share of kinks to work out, especially if you walk in 1 day after a business has opened its doors - for shame!

I paid The Craft a visit on their second night in business (this past Saturday) and to be honest, I thought they were doing a great job all around. Let's break down the experience top to bottom from the other night.

Venue - great spot, they took over for an old speakeasy style pool hall on Atlantic Ave and they've really done some great things with the space. Huge bar area and a totally separate dining area. The decor is simple but doesn't overdue the whole industrial/vintage thing that every restaurant in the world is going for right now. 
Down sides: 1) their A/C wasn't working properly so they attempted to patch this by bringing in an outside cooling unit to blow cold air in until the issue is fixed - it didn't work, I was soaked from sweat, 2) No patio, but one is on the way apparently... although I'm not sure where they are going to put one.

Service - Our server admitted that it was her first night. She'd had a chance to try a few dishes so did her best to make recommendations but where she earned points for the Craft was the fact that she was good at admitting when she didn't know and would go find the answer for us right away to ensure our questions were answered. This DID happen more than you likely want from your servers, even on a soft opening weekend, but most things do come with experience, so I see no problem here. That being said, both the manager and the chef came to check on how we liked everything and even thanked us for our constructive feedback on things that needed minor touches here and there... not even worth mentioning.

Beer - 120. Craft. Beers. On. Tap. That's pretty much all I need to say. There are a healthy selection european beers as well as some more well known brands, but the vast majority are craft microbrews. Gotta catch'em all!

Food - The Craft Charcuterie board had an assortment of nice flavours but was terribly skimpy for what it was. $25 for 6-8 slices of cold cuts and a few scraps of cheese isn't good value. I would avoid this sharable appetizer as it's a real disappointment if you want to try t share it. That said, the Chili Burger (done with a a spicy chili relish not actual beef and bean chili) was very juicy and perfectly balanced in flavour, it didn't need anything else on it - not even ketchup! In addition to the burger I subbed my fries for Asada Fries, which was essentially a carne-asada steak taco turned inside out onto french fries. The portion and quality of the steak on top was amazing, but the fries and dish overall were kind of dry. I'd rate the Charcuterie a 2, the burger a 4 and the fries a 3, respectively.

Price, very reasonable for the most part. Burger, specialty fries, 4 pints, part of the charcuterie board with tax and tip came to just over $70, not bad considering some of the beers were more expensive europeans.

Overall, I think The Craft is going to be a place to watch in Liberty Village, especially as the beer battles heat up in the Village between Local, The Craft and the 3 breweries coming to the area. I'll be back again, thirsty and with friends

{"text":"My friend and I wanted to get brunch, but we realized a little too late that it was 1) Mother's Day and 2) there was a 10k happening for Mother's Day. This was one of the only places that was open and had room for people without a 2 hour wait. They had put a sign on the corner of a side street. Great advertising! The food was great and the service was very quick. I ordered the Salmon Benedict and my friend had the Eggs Guacamole. I also ordered the Radler for a drink. This also seems like a great place to go in the evenings or the weekends. I'd come again during one of those time periods when I'm back in Toronto."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to watch -insert sporting event- then this is the place! How can you go wrong with endless beer choices and huge TVs everywhere? You're right you really can't. 

If you are planing to watch a sporting event here I'd say show up early like you would any other place because it can get packed quick! We ended up sitting at the bar and though I usually don't love sitting at the bar at other places- this one is pretty great! Great view of the TVs and tons of space to eat and drink. 

Totally would come back, even just for drinks! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Failed to execute!
We dropped in on our way to a TFC game. It's only been open for a few months and is already a popular destination for soccer fans. Get there early, but only if they improve on their food service. 
First the good things: great location,  very friendly staff (our bar server - Steve) is knowledgable on product and prompt,  beer selection is amazing, taste and blend of flavours of the food is creative.  Sadly it appears the kitchen needs to better execute:
Sporadic delivery in the food ( I waited ten minutes after my friend got his meal). 
The ribs were tasty, but far too overlooked (2 of the 6 were charred past recognition), special fries were cold and not enough meat on the pulled pork. 
If the cooks and kitchen manager can get their act together on what has enormous potential this place will excel in a very competitive market. I hope they can. I will be back, but cautious."}
{"text":"Wow thank you so much to Matt (manager who selects and manages all the beers in house ) for such excellent service and information at the Craft. We were lucky enough that Matt was able to show us around to the back where all the kegs are kept (such a cool experience) and he provided samples of one of his favourite bourbon cocktails (please please make sure to try it).

I am a huge fan of Belgian beers. It is very difficult to find decent (and affordable) Belgian beers on tap in Toronto, or anywhere really outside of Belgium. The Craft has such a wonderful selection of specialty Belgian brews, many of which I haven't seen since I was in Europe. I'm sorry but The Craft puts Bier Markt to shame, especially with their knowledgeable staff who clearly have a real passion for beer.  

Get to the Craft while you can- once their patio opens expect this hidden gem to start generating line-ups. Love love love!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Sat outside on a great little patio. Food was delicious and Alex K. was an amazing server. Loved it! :)"}
{"text":"This review is for the food portion alone as the beer selection as far as I know is unparalleled in the city. First of the space is huge and can host a large crowd which seems to be the theme for the restaurants/bars in the this neighborhood. The space is designed more for a sports bar theme so if you are looking for that kind of theme you have found your spot. 
Beer selection is astounding and thankfully the had some Belgian and Belgian style beers on tap as well. I am confident you will find your poison of choice in beers one way or the other. 4 Stars for that.
Now for the bad part the food is poor here. It is designed to encourage beer guzzling so is salt heavy. We ordered a flat bread with veggies and I ordered short rib. 
First off I am not sure about this trend of eating of wooden planks as I always wonder how do they sanitize the server ware after use. In addition there isn't much room to maneuver the food. Flat bread fell flat IMO. Dough was OK the ingredients didn't impress much. 2 Stars.
Short Rib was served in a bowl with some veggies on rice. I like short rib and tend to order it when I see it on the menu usually. This one didn't have the taste profile to set it apart. Word of advice to the owners while it may look nice a steak knife and a bowl are not good friends when trying to cut a piece of meat. Just and absurd example of form over function here. The bowl might look nice but can't be used with a steak knife IMO. 
Food is 2 stars from what we tried hence the low rating. I will revisit just for drinks."}
{"text":"Walked in for my friends 30th birthday with a group of 6. We were told a 30 min wait. We got some drinks at the bar and an hour and 45 minutes passes by and we still don't have a table. It was busy. But multiple tables were \"reserved\"  yet no one came. The table was open the whole time. So we left,  this place is amateur. Go to the local down the street."}
{"text":"The beer selection is 5 star. So many taps! I've never seen anything like it!

Super busy on a TFC game night. If you didn't get there before 5pm, you weren't getting a seat. Many people in my group were standing at the bar. We switched around so people who were eating could sit. 

Service was a little hard to snag since it was so busy.

I got the Spring Rolls, but it was just mini sausages wrapped in wonton wrapper and deep fried. They were pretty bad. I would not order them again.

I'd still come back for the beer and to try something else from their menu."}
{"text":"Great great spot to watch the game.

My go-to spot when I have a huge group. Every other restaurant in the city wants a set menu for big groups.

Service is quick and food is great.

Showed up late for McGregor-Mayweather fight. The owner felt so bad it was at capacity he stood outside himself apologizing for turning all the people away. Class act."}
{"text":"Since The Craft showed up in Liberty Village this year, I have had nothing but positive experiences here (hey, that rhymed!)

The staff is always attentive and have been near psychic with their recommendations for craft beers for my personal palate!  Always friendly, and most of them remembered my name the second or third time I walked in to the joint!! (Maybe I'm just that cool?  Doubtful... ;P)

The menu is an absolutely delicious modern take on Filipino cuisine, and the flavour combinations are amazing (i.e.: Mushroom Burger w/ fried egg, Asada Fries, Pulled Pork). Always leave feeling like my soul received a big, warm hug after eating here!  YUM!!!

I just pray the dummies and the goofballs at the Local stay at the Local in order to keep this place classy and chill (fingers crossed!!).  HIGHLY recommend this place to everyone (besides the Local... I REALLY hate the Local and its snobby, sub-human dwellers...)

120 local craft beers on tap (KABOOM!), super-friendly staff, and a FANTASTIC menu with a relaxed, warm vibe... What more could you want?!  ;P"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Wednesday night. Was seated immediately and server was amazing. We ordered a number of appetizers, Korean wings, chicken lettuce wraps, shrimp guac and split the Cobb salad. We were stuffed by the time we finished. Loved the wings and the wraps, guac was a little bland, the Cobb salad was great. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a great random find! We had meant to go elsewhere for our meal and got pulled in one Friday evening by the $4 drinks from 4-7PM weekday promo. Their pull is that they have a huge selection of beers on tap - more than another place I've seen! Their promo is limited to a rotating selection of the beers that I wouldn't have otherwise thought to try. It's great - they get to pull in customers, customers get to try random beers. The ones I tried (one was some blueberry one) were both exotic to me and quite tasty to boot. 

I thought their food is well priced and generally delicious. The galbi smoked wings were kind of meh. I was expecting more - they just weren't that succulent. The Ahi Soba salad is awesome! It's a massive salad and full of goodness. It's an interest combo of grilled, sliced tuna, cold soba noodles, veg and a maple ginger dressing that worked really well together. The tacos are well done. The burgers are good. I had also tried a blueberry pancake-ish dessert that came in a skillet. It was more like a mini cake - definitely something to share at the end.

What you see on the outside does not prepare you for how huge the place is inside. It's massive! Definitely a good place to bring a crowd. It's a pretty chill and casual place to hang out with good food, beer and friends."}
{"text":"They set a table for 22 people at 12. It was empty. They did a great job. The drinks were good food was awesome. I tried the el Diablo and it was a little sour. The fries are great especially with the house sauce. Nachos are tasty, the salsa is a little sweet. The burgers smelt strong but tasted pretty standard. No complaints! Had a good time and they handled our group really well."}
{"text":"This place really got its act together and every time I come back, the items it has to offer, improve. 

While the beer is still offering the same quality and variety (if you don't find a beer you like here, I'm not sure where else you can go), the food has been drastically improved: less items but much much better quality. 
So far there hasn't been any item I didn't like and that hasn't been prepared properly. Lots of them you can tell that are made here, so they are fresh and, as a consequence, delicious. 
My favourite? The daily soup and the burghers. 
Especially for this last item you are given multiple choice to make a combo for your meal: you can upgrade with either sweet potatoes or soup. And trust me, the way they make the fries here is, in my opinion, the best you can get in Toronto: crunchy in the outside and soft in the inside. And this is coming from someone who's not a big fan of fries. 

The service also got better and believe when I say that it was already good before. But here, they have managed to get this better too. 

As per the clientele, it has been always great here: friendly, not excessively loud, down to earth and not pretentious, snobbish or \"have-to-show-off\" kinda attitude that most likely you'll find in other places here in LV. 

So, if my start here hasn't been what I would define as a wonderful marriage, now I can surely be a happy returning customer. 

So, if you want to take my advice, if you're in the area, hop in for a quick bevvy and enjoy a bite. I'm sure you'll like it. 

------------------------------------------------

After several months I've decided to come back to give this place another shot since my very first visit left me very disappointed. 

First thing I have noticed is that the Craft managed to build a patio; small but there's one and it's kinda cute. 
The place inside remained pretty much intact. I still like a lot the main area since it looks much like a proper pub while the side area/room still making me feel like I'm at Denny's more than a pub. 

Let's get to the real biz:
THE SERVICE.
The service has been tremendously improved: nicer (more genuine) and especially more attentive.
THE FOOD. 
I have to admit that the food overall got improved: quality wise (I ordered the same items and it did taste better) and quantity wise (the menu now has fewer items which leads me to believe that they have paid more attention to quality and better cook items than before). 

I would still consider this place not a 4 or 5 stars but the effort put to get better can not go unnoticed and surely deserves a better rating from the one I originally assigned. 

If this is what ownership and management were able to put together, I'm looking forward to more improvement for me to bring this place to where I think it belongs: 4 stars. Not quite there yet. Almost. 
But I'm confident they will make it happen. 

Good job guys!

So, it's hard for me to reverse my"}
{"text":"Came here to watch the Leaf game and it was packed. This place had great service, food, drinks and TV's everywhere!  It was packed!  They have a TON of Craft Beer selection and this is definitely the spot to go to if you love the artistic side of beer. I ordered my usual Delerium and some vodka shots cuz Vodka is required for my bloodstream.  I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"I came here for a really quick bite with a girlfriend before going out.  The place is very spacious with a beautiful bar, tvs and nice comfy booth seats all around the restaurant.  As we got seated, we informed the waitress that we were kind of in a rush.  They served us water right away and asked if there was anything they could help in suggesting food items they thought we would like.  I ended up ordering their Short Rib Tacos and my friend ordered the Galbi Smoked Wings.  I highly, highly recommend the Short Rib Tacos!  They were so tender and the flavours of the tacos are to die for.  I'm not a fan of cilantro or anything that has cilantro in it because of the overpowering taste and smell.  I will not eat anything with it in it or I will pick out each piece but this dish had cilantro in it and I couldn't even taste it! Both dishes were delicious and tasty, which was also finished within minutes.  The waitress that we had was quick to accommodate us, settling our bills and she was also very engaging and extremely friendly.  All in all, it was a short and sweet experience.  But I am definitely coming back next time to check out the beers and obviously coming back again for those Short Rib Tacos."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. 
Delicious food. 
Love the beer tasting. 
120 different beers on tap. 

Only con is the shareable meal I got wasn't that shareable. I got the Rib Tacos. There were just 3 medium size tacos - I think that's more of a 1 person meal."}
{"text":"Pros: Reasonably priced drinks during happy hour, delicious soba tuna salad, tasty guac, very friendly staff. 

Cons: Salad overpriced, service slow at points, decor tried to be cool but missed the mark. 

Verdict: Would recommend."}
{"text":"Great place for groups. We came as a fairly large group (16) and they sat us down pretty quickly and made sure that we were taken care of, even when it got busier as the night went on. 

It's a pretty big place and they've got a wide selection of beers to choose from and a nice food menu. With a large beer menu it's hard to pick and choose, especially if you're someone like me who likes to experiment, so getting the flight is a great way to try out several beers (4) per order."}
{"text":"Amazing place!  Can't beat the beer selection.  If you're trying to rack up points on untappd this is the best place in Toronto to go to.  Staff is great and friendly the only thing I would improve is the food.  It's pretty good but they could take it up a notch I think.  The shrimp tacos are amazing but everything else I had was average.  None the less, a must for beer fan like myself."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, lots of screens to see the game. Food is not that great. At least the wings and nachos anyway. Wings were over cooked and you only get 7 for $15 with no sides with it. Nachos had a strange cheez whiz like sauce that i was not a fan of and the chips just aren't salty. Also fairly expensive for nachos for a sub par plate in my opinion. $23 for adding guac and chicken. Great beer selection though... tons. Could maybe go up to 3 stars but 2 cause service was slow. Now that being said it was busy last night due to the Leafs, Raps, Jays and TFC playing games so hard to blame the server but would have been nice if she checked on us more than twice during my visit."}
{"text":"Support your local watering holes, particularly if they have as good a selection of draft craft beers as craft does.
The food is good, surely nothing to write home about but it'll do. The ambiance is great and they even have a patio now: lots of beer selection, stumbling distance ... What more could you want??"}
{"text":"Food: Fine, nothing stand out, kinda pricey for what it is. My buds like the food, I do not, But I'm into fine dining etc. 
Booths are nice size! Service is mediocre even when place is half full - been here three times. 
Wine is limited - beer place. mixed drinks were weak every time. Love the TV's, hate the speaker placements - too loud in some spots, 99% of the time, too loud right above my head, because I get shoved into corners on game days. no clue why, but I love sports, lame. so... looking for new friends for afternoon game watching: please apply. ;'P
Pretty joint!"}
{"text":"I came here for a quick bite to eat with my dad and we had a good time overall! The interior was nice and cozy with a modern rustic feel with exposed brick walls etc. Our servers were also very helpful with their choice of craft beers and provided a few samples so we could choose the best option. The craft beer menu was overwhelming while the food menu was more modest. But I like places that don't offer a menu that is a novel with 12 chapters and plot twists (cough, pickle barrel), because I usually find the items they DO offer are perfected and the kitchen specializes in them. After ordering a couple drinks we got some starters to share: mushroom flathead, shrimp tacos, and guacamole. The mushroom flathead was really good with sauteed mushrooms, red onion, spinach and goat cheese, however my only tiny complaint was that it was a bit dry, but it was still really good. The shrimp tacos were perfect, and the guacamole was great with freshly fried tortilla chips. Overall definitely a great place and a must try if you're near liberty village and looking for a good craft beer. Just wasn't anything outrageously special (yet) for me to give it that full 5 stars though."}
{"text":"It used to be better. I hope it isn't going downhill too much. I used to love this place. It's in a nice area, it's a casual atmosphere, and service is ok. 

First few times I went here, I'd say it was great, 4.5/5 kind of deal. Couple months later I came back and my experience was entirely different. I might be a little harsh on my rating, but it's because I'm comparing it to my first experience. 

Food:
I got the fried chicken sandwich, which I have had before and remembered it being really tasty. Although it might have used to be a chicken and waffle kind - could've sworn it was. My main issue was the chicken was fried a bit dark this time (old frying oil) and it wasn't hot. It was slightly more than warm but not hot. My girlfriend's soup was lukewarm and kind of strange looking. Waitress told her it was cream of mushroom but it looked more like a chip dip. It was really thick, dark and lumpy. 

Beer: 
This isn't the first time I've spent 10 minutes browsing the huge list of beer they have to finally find one I want, and be told they were out. Why would you advertise having a large selection of beer but be sold out of several selections. You could AT LEAST let your servers know to tell the customers what taps are unavailable that day/night. It's disappointing to wait 10 minutes and all your friends have their drinks and they tell you you're is unavailable. 

Overall I'm disappointed on how far they've fallen from the good food and beer they used to serve. Maybe I'll come again, since it's a local spot. But my expectations have been severely lowered."}
{"text":"I'm not one to venture to Liberty Village too often, but this place will certainly bring me around more frequently. As a lover of craft beer, I knew before the place even opened that I'd be a fan. As an experienced visitor of new restaurants, I decided to give this place a few weeks after opening to work through the standard growing pains before trying it out. And here we are, a month after opening and I really have to say great things overall.

The beer selection, as many have mentioned, is pretty amazing. Lots of unique and rare options and the ordering of flights makes it a great way to try new things while revisiting tastes of the past as well. I feel like 1 of our glasses was incorrect (Spearhead Hawaiian tasted like a wheat ale instead of its normal pineapple infused pale ale goodness), but in the grand scheme of things it was a minor error and forgotten about 5 ounces later. 

Food wise, admittedly is the reason this place isn't getting 5 stars. Started with the Lumpia Spring Rolls with positive results, especially enjoyed the banana ketchup. But then moved on to splitting a Craft Classic Burger, Pulled Pork Sandwich, and side order of Garlic Fries. 
The burger was the better of the sandwiches, adequate in flavour and sitting within a nice brioche bun. Not the best or worst burger I've payed $10 for, so will remain indifferent on this. The pulled pork was super weak though. A rather disappointing amount of pulled pork put within a Sesame Seed Ciabatta. Now I love ciabattas, and am indifferent to sesame seeds, but this bun was just overpoweringly bready compared to the minimal amount of decently flavoured pulled pork and the lesser enjoyable apple sauerkraut flavours also serving as a topping within.
That said, the garlic fries are really delicious and come with a tasty aioli. PRO TIP: instead of opting for the $5 side of fries to the sandwich, order the appetizer sized plate for $6 and have enough for 2 people to share.

Service was friendly and the place seems adequately staffed for a Friday night, so here we are, true to my first paragraph... I'm a fan, and will be back!"}
{"text":"I am visiting from out of town and came here with two friends on a Tuesday night after enjoying some drinks elsewhere and we were in dire need of some food. Our server Erika was amazing! She helped create custom flights for two of us, all I told her was that I liked fruity/sour/wheat beers and every beer she put in the flight was delicious. She also recommend the craft burger which was delicious. My friends who I am visiting live down the street from here and I can definitely see why they come here so often for dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"Cute spot in liberty village, and it's also huge. It's an excellent spot for a friendly gathering and for a few drinks or ten - seriously, their beer menu is huuuge and they support local breweries, so it's definitely a go from me.

They have a huge variety of food on their menu from a tofu sandwich to a huge rack of ribs. One thing I don't understand though is why they upcharge $1 to change fries to a salad/soup - like, sweet potato fries or something more fancy, I get it.. but salad or soup? C'mon. I upgraded my fries to the soup of the day, cream of mushroom - which wasn't cream of mushroom at all. It was some chunky, brown soup that just stank of \"I used too much mushroom in this\" ..the texture was way too gritty and chunky AND it wasn't even hot, more like lukewarm. No bueno.
The tofu sandwich I had was pretty legit though, with such a thick piece of tofu cut between some veggies and bread. Super filling for a vegetarian meal!

Friends all had different meals and most of it was said to be \"good, but can be better\" or \"I've had better\" or \"they used to be better\" - don't get me wrong, the food all looked delectable. Definitely wouldn't mind eating here again.

Service is really great too; the waitress messed up my change and cut me short $10 and when brought to her attention, she was super apologetic and friendly about it. This is definitely your neighbourhood friendly pub!"}
{"text":"Waa there for a VIP Muskoka event which was amazinv. So this is strictly on the food..it was tasty but pretty well standard. Firecrackers fries and ribs. 
Cream cheese firecrackers just feel a bit well dated I'd love to see some more modern updated shareable plates as the space is beautiful. 
I will definitely give it another shot for the space alone."}
{"text":"First, the space was dark and depressing and it lacked the \"feel\".  It felt like I was in a mall chain restaurant.  I don't know how else to explain it!  The service was great, and I loved the ability to craft my own flight of beer.  Beers were good, great selection.  We ordered the cheesy nachos and some tacos.  It was good, but I don't know that I would make an effort to go back."}
{"text":"The beer selection was great the cocktails however were small and did not fit the establishment's vibe.

food itself tasted reheated and bland.

service was on the slow side even though it was not at all busy. 

would not recommend to anyone looking grab anything other than a beer.

One of those places that makes you say \"what did i pay for\" when staring at the bill."}
{"text":"This place has potential. Gonna be more of a winter spot than a summer one, due to the lack of outdoor seating. 150 beers on tap is a big bet for the owners, especially when competing with their already successful rivals in liberty village.  

I haven't tried the food yet, just had some beers. 
But the friends that had the burger and the pork chop said they were amazing! 

Service is very slow, servers don't seem like they had any prior serving experience.. But, I'm sure things will whip into shape soon. 

Gonna have to just wait and see if they master their craft!"}
{"text":"If you like craft beer and want a selection that will never bore you, this place is the spot to be! The Craft has dozens and dozens of great craft beers from as local to the neighbourhood to across North America.

The atmosphere, like many of the restaurants/shops in Liberty Village is modern yet pays homage to the building's heritage. Service is quick, friendly and accurate. I've only had the food here once (assorted appetizers) but they were all well done and aesthetically presented.

Overall, this restaurant is a great addition to the ever growing Liberty Village neighbourhood and I will be going back again soon."}
{"text":"There are a lot of reasons to go to Liberty Village and for residence a lot of choices. Where the Craft stands out is with its people. The menu is extensive enough to satisfy everyone, the drink choices unreal but the people are what make the difference.  They care about the customers and go out of their way to take care of the regulars which I have never seen in Liberty Village"}
{"text":"We organized an event at Craft Brasserie and everything was amazing from the planning to the service, food and drinks. The team was so organized, friendly and accommodating. Overall super pleasant experience and look forward to visiting again, also - great beer menu!"}
{"text":"Setting: large and spacious converted factory. Has both inside and smaller outdoor section. We were sat outside where the air con unit was rather over bearing, though I'm sure it's not so bad in other sections. 

Staff: attentive and friendly

Drinks: large selection of brews, which the staff are happy to guide you through. The menu is rather difficult to navigate.

Food: rather bland and unimaginative."}
{"text":"Incredible selection of beers. Seems like a great party place for millennials, I'm not one.

Had their basic burger and French fries. Burger is very good and love those fries! Remind me of the fries I grew up with in the 50s and 60s.

Third time there and enjoyed the food and beer each time."}
{"text":"My favourite place to grab a beer in Liberty. They have an extensive beer list and the bartenders know their product if you have any questions. Also, if you are an indecisive person or just want to try a bunch of beer you can get a flight, which is nice. The food is good and they have a good variety. They also have plenty of tvs so it's a great place to watch sports. Another positive is that the restaurant is large so it is usually easy to get a table with a bigger group."}
{"text":"The service was okay - but the food was amazing!! I had the veggie burger and it was really good, lots of beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Pros:
Great location
Pleasant staff
Televisions everywhere
Wonderful atmosphere
Great beer selection

Cons:
Price to food portion size
A bit loud at night
Margaritas and Bloody Caesars are not good 

Summary:
A great place to grab a couple beers or a pitcher with friends. Lots of beers to choose from! 
I wish the portion size was better, but the beer selection is amazing :)"}
{"text":"This was a cool spot. We went there after dinner for a flight and some plantain chips. Brought my pregnant wife and my two year old son. They were great to us. He rocked out in the booth to some good music while we watched a game on one of their many big screen tv's, and hung out. Hardest part was picking for beers from their list of 120 for my flight..."}
{"text":"The food isn't anything mind blowing by any means! But, those flights are my favorite. There are so many beers to choose from that they really have something for everyone. I like the fruity beers, I really like the cherry one! I love how there are TVs everywhere and there are different games on. The waitstaff has been pretty consistent in a good way. They also offer happy hour which I really like, they make a decent Caesar drink as well. If you haven't tried it yet, I suggest you check it out! The flight is a MUST!"}
{"text":"If you are a fan of beer, you won't be disappointed by the plethora of choice. They have a book for you hoppers to choose from. It's quite an impressive tap sight.

As a non-beer drinker, my focus then turns to the food. This place is a solid 3. Filling and definitely not boring. It definitely has some Filipino influences! I appreciated the lumpia spring rolls with its dipping sauce. A spicy version of banana ketchup which from our large table felt like the banana flavour was lost in the seasoning which was disappointing for first timers.

The fried chicken sandwich was alright. Well seasoned, moist sandwich but I felt it lacked a good compliment to accessorize it.  County general's version, is a hard example to beat. So, I would have to order something different. 

The white brownie with chai tea ice cream was okay but it really tasted more like yellow cake with vanilla ice cream which was what one person thought it was.  It wasn't bad just fell flat on the expectations we had on the flavour and pastry itself.

I definitely would return. It's promising and the space is comfortable."}
{"text":"Damn good find, and a happy New Years 2016 first review to all!

So, a buddy from work had a birthday and I had suggested pho but the spot I go to at midnight was closed so, they suggested this place which I hadn't heard of up to this point. I think I should have.

For starters, the beer selection is incredible. I am not certain of the exact number, but it's close to 115 beers on tap. Real clean, well organized and accompanies a full bar. I spotted 3 bottles of Dalwhinnie on the shelf. Nice. 

Secondly, the food. Prices are a bit high, but it's Liberty Village and a craft beer establishment. Let it roll. Because the food is INCREDIBLE. I had the mushroom burger. One of if not THE best burger I've ever had. Handmade patty, French fried onions, Hilton (sp.?) cheese, three different types of mushrooms and black garlic aioli on a fresh crescent roll. Fries were done perfectly. $14. How do you go wrong? You don't if you eat here. Buddy had the nachos. Also of incredible quality.

Last but most definitely NOT least, the beer. They have these 'flights' of beer for $11. For that price you get four beers of your choosing from the ridiculous beer menu I made mention of before. Any of them. And the servings are generous. The staff knows their stuff so I deferred to them for my choices and they did not steer me wrong! I did tell them I customarily drank light, 'crisp' beers and enjoyed American style brews, but that was it. I'm not the beer expert, they are, and they were spot on.

The atmosphere is really chill, very cool, and as my buddy told me, a great place to bring a date. So the next girl I meet who asks where we should go, we're going here.

Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"We went to The Craft on a Monday afternoon for lunch. We had the beef rib tacos, the original Craft burger, and buttermilk Cobb salad. 

The food was really good. It reminded me slightly of pub fare, but all of the dishes were elevated. 

The beef rib tacos were probably the stand-out dish. The beef was juicy and tender, with a sweet and smoky flavour. The plantain chips added a crunchy texture, and the pickled red onion balanced the sweetness of the beef. The guac and mint Greek yogurt added a nice freshness to the dish. 

I had the buttermilk Cobb salad, but requested spinach instead of kale, and feta instead of blue cheese. The Craft was super accommodating and the dish came as requested. The salad was huge and hearty- I couldn't finish it even though it was tasty. My friend had the burger and really like it as well. 

I'd give the food 4 stars given the reasonable portion to cost ratio. Like j said above- similar to pub food (hearty and comforting), but fresher and with more complex flavour and texture combinations. 

The service was definitely the highlight of our visit (beef tacos were a close second!). Alex K. was attentive and friendly, but not intrusive. He gave solid food recommendations when we asked about dishes as we were torn on what to order. He also didn't bat an eye with all of our modification requests, which we both appreciated. I am always happy to pay for anything I request or change on a dish (e.g. Substituting one cheese for another), but I hate it when servers make me feel like it's the biggest deal in the world. Alex K. said he just wanted us to love the food and they would be happy to accommodate. THAT is the kind of thing that makes me go back to a place!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for a Saturday brunch with a friend and my infant son (who, by the way, was also hungry and looking forward to their blueberry pancakes). On arrival, the hesitating young hostess paused and uttered something along the lines that there may not be a high chair available for my son, given they only have two and both may be in use. If you've been to The Craft, you will appreciate how pathetic is it for an establishment of its size to only have 2 high chairs. As it turns out, a family was just leaving, making the high chair available for us to use. 

We were seated. As we grew increasingly hungry and curious as to the whereabouts of the server, we realized that 27 minutes had passed and no server had approached our table. The section where we were placed was about two-thirds vacant. All this while, my son was getting increasingly hungry and irritable. 

I noted the server dealing with an adjacent table with a party of about 7 or 8, and as I looked her her in the eye, she quickly looked away, ignored my obviously getting upset, and continued dealing with the adjacent table. 

I walked up to the hostess and expressed to her that we had not yet heard from our server, now, half an hour into our being seated, to which she replied \"really?!!!\" \"Yes!\" I said. \"I wouldn't lie to you.\"  She said that she was shocked that the server had not yet materialized. At that point, we were getting our coats on and leaving the establishment as the service was unacceptable. She began apologizing and uttering something around giving me coupons for a free meal, but couldn't find the coupons. I shook my head and walked away. Shortly thereafter, the manager approached us as we were leaving and offered his apologies and his business card.

Um, what? Business card?

Anyway, he offered that whatever it was we wanted, we could order and he will \"have it out in 2 minutes.\" Ok, so let me get this straight: two orders of pancakes will be delivered to the kitchen, prepared, fried, plated, and served to me in 120 seconds or less? Don't think so. I thanked the manager and began walking away. At this point, my son was too hungry for any more negotiations and further bull****


He managed to run somewhere and come back with two free appetizer coupons, continuously trying to talk to my friend, while I'm trying to go home to get my son fed. 

So, we left. Wasted time. Wasted energy. Left hungry and upset. 

Terrible. Unacceptable. Insensitive. Not family friendly."}
{"text":"The food is ok but not that great for the price. This is a new place in LV, opened in May 2015.  I never saw too much traffic, so I went for lunch with a couple of colleagues.  They have lot's of beers, typical LV prices (overpriced), but the food is lacking.  I guess they are not positioning themselves as a work lunch venue, but that would be a mistake.  

I had one of their lunch specials, but was underwhelmed.  So were the guys with me.  Maybe a good place for a draft, but won't be back for the food."}
{"text":"Came here as part of a group on a Friday night; the place can get pretty busy. Feels trendy. They quickly switched to the Raptor's game when it came on.

The beer menu here is huge, like 4 pages. It would have been a bit better if the menu was better organized I think.. In any case, they have these pre-set flight options or you can make your own. Being indecisive I just choose one that samples the different types. All were quite good.

For food, I got the Chipotle Lime Cauliflower starter, and the Pork Belly Rice Bowl. The cauliflower was alright, not too memorable. The Rice Bowl was very flavourful. Had lots of ingredients, but it got a little greasy eating it. Which maybe should be understandable with the pork belly but still.

Service was great. Very friendly and helpful, especially when selecting the drinks."}
{"text":"There is not much to recommend this place from the outside, but this semi-underground restaurant is deceptively spacious and is basically a vault of endless choices in beer. I'm not kidding, the food menu is one page... while the beer list is several pages in a booklet with small font. It takes a while to scan through but there are definitely a lot to choose from and you are bound to find something you like. The servers are very helpful if you need any help deciding between two choices or explaining a beer you've never seen/heard/thought existed before. I particularly like that you can order a flight of 4 beers from anywhere in the menu, and aren't restricted to one particular section. 

The food is a second thought for me at this place, cus beer is the main attraction here. Nevertheless, the food was pretty good also. I had the short ribs empanadas as a side to my beer, it was packed full off flavorful meat and the pastry was short but flaky at the same time. I will definitely be back in the near future to work my way through the beer selection."}
{"text":"What a great spot tucked into Liberty Village! This huge semi below ground venue boasts what literally seemed like hundreds of different craft beers, romantic lighting, lots of televisions playing different sports channels and a delicious pub-like menu.

To me the best part about The Craft was how big it was inside. There's a large bar section with booths & tables as well as an even larger dining section with massive booths for a more intimate experience. There is a patio up top for those looking to enjoy the views of south central downtown T.O. 

I'm not a beer drinker so I can't offer much of a review on pretty much the biggest aspect of this restaurant BUT I can tell you that their food is worth returning for. I ordered a Royale because I love Pulp Fiction accompanied with sweet potato fries and my date ordered a Buttermilk Fried Chicken sandwich with a caesar salad. 

The Royale (lettuce, pickle, american cheese, russian dressing) was mouth-watering and the sweet potato fries came with a spicy aoli that I couldn't get enough of. My date described his chicken sandwich as being fried perfectly and not too crunchy. 

The prices were expected of a restaurant of this genre & location (most items between $13-30). This would be a great place to bring a date or watch the game with friends. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Found the manager (short guy) very rude and the staff disorganised and unprofessional.  It's a shame, because the beer selection is decent, but overall was left feeling like a second class citizen. Management needs a shake up!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times for Friday drinks with friends. They have an amazing selection of beers and ciders. Both times we have sat in the bar, but both times we had to ask the hostess to sit there as we were led to the quiet and mostly bare dining room. The bartenders are really nice and personable and so are the waitstaff. The hostesses seem like they aren't very well trained. Besides always leading us away from the action, the last time I was there I asked to wait for a bar table when I saw 2 groups get their bills at the same time. She told me she would put my name down and my group of 4 would get the first free table. While we waited at the bar we saw both groups leave, the hostesses push the 2 empty tables together and seat a group of 6 that had arrived after us. Needless to say I was not impressed and had a few words with the hostess who told me that group had arrived before us. When I informed her I saw them come in she froze up and had nothing to say. We had to wait for another 20 minutes for another table to leave. But the manager did spot the incident and sent along 4 lemon drop shots, which was nice but didn't really make up for the incident. I would go back for sure because it is a great place to grab a few drinks with friends and is a nice environment. I just hope they have figured out how to seat people in order!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this only has 3 1/2 stars but I see why. Misguided customers thinking it's a family restaurant. First and foremost, this is not a family restaurant. There's Dennys and Chuck-e-cheese for that. Second, every place you go to has an identity. The Craft has a great identity. It is a great place for working professionals especially for those working in the area. This place has120 craft brews on tap and rotationals. This is the perfect sweet spot for beer lovers! The environment is great, food tastes amazing, friendly staff especially the lovely bartending ladies! (That's a shout out!) Their brunch is freakin good too! Reasonably priced well. I love going here and have my beer or two after work. I'd like to see maybe a small expansion in the food menu department or even add seasonal food menu. My favourite place to go!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with a group of friends for drinks and food. Overall, it was a great time. There is a nice looking patio but we sat inside which is actually huge. I opted for the nachos and salsa. The description on the menu was smoked jalapeño and tomato salsa with lime salted tortilla chips. Let's not get confused here - it was a lumpy plain tomato salsa with stale chips that had no hint of lime. But I'll forgive them for that. I tried a flight of four beers which is a super great way of sampling their expansive craft beer list. Service was generally quite attentive. What I was impressed with the most was the server's patience while we all took forever to decide on which four beers to order. I would definitely return to sample more beers and try some other food items."}
{"text":"love this spot! Such a awesome beer selection staff is fun food is delish. The bar manager is an endless source of beer knowledge. Having the staff pt together a flight for you is such a good idea. Great way to try new beers."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend because it's close to work. It's a nice place for drinks, the beer selection is top notch (soooooooo many choices). Happy hour special is 4$ for a couple of the cocktails and beers!!!!! (4-7pm). 

Food was good, the dressed fries were good, steak cooked perfectly, but the fries were underwhelming. Popcorn chicken was delicious (panko style crust), but quite a small portion (order two if you like popcorn chicken!!) 

Will definitely be coming back for happy hour!!! :D"}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night for the winterlicious menu. 

The service was great. Our server made sure to ask us how our food was, gave us our food on time and my friend requested her paella to be remade and they were happy to do so. 

On to the food. The food was what took the 2 stars away.
I had the tomato salsa. It tasted nothing special, in fact it tasted like Torrito's sauce. Also and the seafood paella. The rice was a tad bit hard and I could tell it was just reheated as some parts of the bowl wasn't hot. The brownie fudge with vanilla ice cream was the best. But I felt that was something that's bought in bulk.

Over all great service but the food could use a little more work. The decor is also very nice, they have a glass window which you can see all the beers that they offer."}
{"text":"Generally unimpressed with this new addition to Liberty Village. Great selection of beer but that's where the positives end. Slow service and the sever mixed up the plates and I got the wrong burger and didn't realize until already eating it. The portions are tiny for the price and the burger I got was mediocre. There are much better places in the area to eat at for better food and better value."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, plenty of food options, easy to pop in with friends or to take advantage of their happy hour specials ($4 drinks until 8?!) I had the flat bread and it was great."}
{"text":"This place is not good. Menu has lots on it but not a fan of anything to be honest. Chicken spring rolls were very dry, popcorn shrimp was way too salty, and the tacos were extremely spicy.. I also tired their beer sangria... Waste of $10. My friend ordered one that had tomato juice in it and I can tell you she looked sick after one sip. Not a fan of this place at all. It's a shame I was excited about it because it was a brand new place in Liberty village. Not to mention their service is terrible! The first time I went with a group of 5 people and the waitress nearly forgot 3 things during the night and looked really annoyed when it came to serving us. I decided to give this place another try and boy I shouldn't have. Me and my boyfriend ordered food and specifically asked the waitress to come back in 10 minutes to order some more food since we were still hungry and she forgot. After another 25 minutes she told us the kitchen was closed and  walked away with attitude. Never again!"}
{"text":"Nice spot in Liberty Village with a decent patio. Was heading to the Local but decided to try something different. It wasn't super busy when we walked in and we got a nice seat on the patio. The server took awhile to take our drink and food orders and when I asked if instead of a 2oz Moscow Mule to just get a 1oz, the waitress said 2oz wasn't that strong and that if I wanted 1oz it would be the same price. I decided to just get a 2oz and it was strong and a bit much for a weekday evening low key drink. 

Food was mediocre and I thought pretty pricey for what we got. My friend loved his burger though - said it was really good. Service after that got a bit better but other than that my experience was ok."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and was excited by the beer selection. We had several flights of awesome craft brews. We had the garlic fries to start which were amazing. They had several other fry selections as well that all sounded delicious. Additionally, we had their sliders which were excellent as well. Amazing beer and food packaged with great service!"}
{"text":"Amazing selection of beer and even better food. The pulled pork empenadas were definitely the best I've had in ages. You could taste a smokiness to the pastry. I could eat these all day. The only downside to this place is some of the patrons. We were near a table of early 20 somethings and for no reason they tossed a salt shaker at us. The food here doesn't need salt because it's seasoned so well.  Still a good experience minus the social misfits."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch based on our Toronto nephew's recommendation. Great choice.

We had a variety of dishes and all were excellent. The poached eggs with avocado and goat cheese served over a toasted croissant was especially delicious. The burger with peameal bacon and poached egg was as good as it was heart unhealthy.

Service was very efficient and friendly, prices fair, and they have a very large and interesting selection of beers on tap.

Worth a stop."}
{"text":"Yesterday I made my 1st visit to the venue in almost a year; it was for a 'Brunch 'N' Beers Event with a social Group I helped run in the past.  The Organizer of the Event and I had met earlier in Liberty Village and we arrived at The Craft about 1 1/2 hours prior to the start time of the Event, 1 pm, so we sat at the bar in the then barren venue and ordered 2 beers.  Our Bartender was quite friendly/cordial, I enjoyed my beer and liked that many of the beers on offer could be ordered in smaller quantities.

Our table was ready prior to 1 pm, so we settled our bills and moved to our table, which was in the raised section of The Craft.  I asked if I could order something from the lunch menu instead and was told by our Server that it shouldn't be a problem as I wanted to have poutine.  Despite having a group of 13 people, it appeared service was quite prompt and my poutine quite good and of course pretty filling.

Having 120 beers on tap obviously makes the venue a good destination for beer connoisseurs, and again having many selections avail. in different quantities is quite logical given their vast selection.

I recommend checking The Craft if you're in the neighbourhood and want to partake in quality beer and/or food in a somewhat upscale and spacious venue."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at The Craft Brasserie & Grille.

Gord ordered the Cashew Chicken Bowl.  He said it was good and he'd get it again.

I ordered Buffalo Chicken Sliders (minus lettuce) and Garlic Fries.  I've had them before and they were good.

Paige was our server and she took good care of us."}
{"text":"Great beer selection although I get sad sometimes when they run out of my favs. Stefany (not a typo) is a really nice server. Somewhat hipster free which is nice considering I can have a beer without having a  beard tainting  my pint. 

Food isn't bad either. Good vegetarians selections. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"The selection of beer (especially local beer) is amazing.  In particular, I am a huge fan of the tasting flights, which include four 5 oz. samples for $10.50.  A little more expensive than a pint, but you get to try four different beers.  Unfortunately, everyone is similarly excited about the flights, leading to massive delays in drink orders.  It takes forever to make a drink order--everyone at the table lists off their four beers, while the waiter or waitress writes it all down.  Then, he or she goes and writes all of the beers in chalk on the stand that holds the four beers for each customer.  It would be much more efficient to have small paper menus and customers could check off which four beers they want, then the piece of paper could be clipped on to the stand with the beers in the same order they appear on the paper.  We waited at least 20 minutes every time that we ordered new drinks, which is ridiculous.  

We shared a couple of food items--the asada fries and crispy wontons with some sort of salad--which were also decent.  

My other criticism relates to the atmosphere.  We were in the back room (the one without the bar).  The lights were way too bright, there were giant tvs playing sports, hair metal on the speakers, and booths with plastic-y material, all reminiscent of a Swiss Chalet or Boston Pizza lounge in the suburbs.  The ambiance does not match the concept.  The decor looks like they serve 5 beers (along the lines of Keith's, Molson Canadian, and Coors Light) and mediocre bar food classics (along the lines of regular cheeseburgers and chicken fingers), rather than carefully selected craft beers and douche-ified (in a good way) pub food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, amazing selection of beers and a great place to meet a group of friends!! Will definitely e coming back here for more dinner and drinks"}
{"text":"Went there today for a work lunch.

Got the Asada fries and chicken sliders and bean and corn salsa to share. It was decent overall (fries were my favorite).

Got the Cuban sandwich and the pork could use more seasoning. It lacked flavour overall. 

The beer selection is insane!"}
{"text":"Not at all impressed
Hopefully they get their shit together quick: service was friendly but slow. Took my buddy's food order and didn't bother to ask if I was gonna eat!
Nice selection of beers but the waitress couldn't tell me anything about them...
The food was VERY good though 
I'll come back in a couple week and see..."}
{"text":"Wicked awesome!!!!! That's all I really should have to say.  

Food 10/10
Service 10/10
Atmosphere 10/10
Price 10/10

Want a great night out with friends? OR just as a couple?? ... GO!!   You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Don't go here with large groups! I booked my birthday here for a group of 25. They seemed so at ease on the phone when I made the reso. So, I didn't think the server would find it so challenging - or would so blatantly express her annoyance to us. Her frustration, and subsequent rudeness, with many in my group left a bad taste in my mouth. Saying things like \"This is ridiculous\" when being asked if another order could be placed from someone on the other side of the table. And don't dare move seats! She nearly ripped my brother and cousin's heads off. Thing is, I work in hospitality, and have served many large groups over the years. Her behaviour was very unprofessional and overly dramatic. 
I did email to follow up, and heard nothing back. 

The food was just okay. My burger was too salty and the bun too dense. The beer I had was good, and the portions are quite large. 

With so many other options in our fair city, with at least mediocre service and good food, I won't be returning!"}
{"text":"Nice bar, with lots of beer options.  The food was decent.  But it all about the beer in this place.  Could use a patio."}
{"text":"This review is regarding drinks only at The Craft.

I absolutely loved the huge selection of craft beer here - 120 of them on tap! There is a nice, chill patio facing a relatively quiet street in Liberty village. The prices for drinks here are really good, considering you can order a set of 4 tasters at 5 oz each for $11, and there is no limitations on what you can select!

Would definitely come back here again for drinks."}
{"text":"Hey Yelpers!
On September 19 of this year, we had the chance to win the bar's first ever online contest for a free dinner worth $50 for two through Instagram. We were lucky enough to get the said prize and for the two of us foodies, we definitely enjoyed our food and beer experience. We were greeted and welcomed right away by two adorable hostesses and courteously led to our reserved seats (we felt like VIPs). I was completely stunned with the crafts beer selection in the bar AND I'm really proud that they are fully supporting our local beer industry here in Ontario! One of the managers (Kayla/Shaela) was nice enough to introduce and welcome us to the restaurant that night. My boyfriend and I both selected the \"Beer Flight\" which offers flight of four different beers in five ounce glasses. Beer lovers or beer newbies will surely have fun picking their drinks as there are one hundred and twenty beers to choose from! My boyfriend was overwhelmed and shocked to see how much beers there were serving and needed extra time to choose his flight(I did my beer research before coming in the restaurant so I had my order up and going). My beer preference would be for the light lagers or citrusy, orange beers. I picked the Weiss beer- belgian wheat beer, Hop cider- dry hopped cider, and two randoms. All of them taste amazing!  I am a sucker for Belgian wheat beers since I tried Shock Top and Hoegaarden. The Weiss beer was perfect as I was able to satisfy my cravings for the orange peel taste in a beer. Okay, so moving onto food- we chose to have the Lumpia spring rolls, Blue cheese fries, Cuban stack, and Mushroom burger. I was happy and giddy to see Lumpia in their bar menu as it is a Filipino appetizer present in a Western menu bar. I would recommend the said spring rolls as the recipe sticked with the traditional Filipino way of cooking (approved by my Filipino taste) , also served with the classic pairing of banana ketchup, although the banana ketchup tasted different from the traditional one. The Blue cheese fries was definitely the food of the night as the serving size was huge and good for sharing with a food buddy. I think there were caramelized onion in the fries- I liked that because it added a bit of sweetness with the salty taste from the fries. I was already getting full when I was about to start my Cuban stack sandwich but I gave myself a little push to heighten my curiosity to give the sandwich a bite and decide whether I should go on with the instincts of my taste buds. The sandwich was indeed a hit for my tiny taste buds. They sliced the sandwich in half, so I found it to be big in serving too. I like the pork and capicolla meat plus the swiss cheese in it. Yum! My partner had the Mushroom burger and he devoured it in seven minutes! I had two bites and it was pretty up there too! The entrees were delicious, satisfying and both of us enjoyed the whole dinner:) The bar was busy on a Saturday night (Blue Jays night too) but the service was an A+ as the hostess always looked after us whether we needed something or not. I would recommend this dining spot as it is in the heart of the city and there are lots of seats to entertain each guests for either a casual or special dining experience. If you guys dont try at least one beer, then you suck. You would miss the wonders of this amazing craft restaurant! Thanks to the staff and chef who made my boyfriend and I's night a wonderful time! The free dinner fell on my birthday month too so it was really a surprise! i wish we took a photo with the manager but we got too tipsy and shy ahaha! We will definitely come back and try another beer flight next time:)"}
{"text":"This place feels like a craft brewery rolled out in Ikea boxes from a truck.  Starbucks has more character.  The menu was uninspiring and the service was less than enthusiastic.  It looks like they invested a zillion bucks to buy an authentic craft brewery customer experience.  In my opinion they ended up wide of the mark."}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang out. Great selection of beers and the servers are amazing, our server's name was Erika. She knew her beers very well, she was quick to cater us with food and drinks. She was absolutely amazing. 

We ordered popcorn chicken with three sauces and sweet potato fries. Both were very good."}
{"text":"Finally checked out this new spot in Liberty Village that has over 120 beers on tap!! Very exciting for a beer lover such as myself. What's even better is that you can sample the beers by ordering a flight of 4, 5 oz samples. They have the beers sectioned off by beer styles which is very helpful if you're up to discovering new craft beers. 

The food menu is fantastic with lots of delicious options to choose from. I had the chili ginger chicken lettuce wraps which were very flavourful and filling with a side of plantain chips. My friends had the burger and highly recommended it. 

This new restaurant is massive so you don't have to worry about not getting a table and soon they will have a outdoor patio as well!!

Awesome spot!!"}
{"text":"Decent food, friendly, and happy service from the hostess to the waitress... I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Food is 5/5 
Service 5/5 ..thanks Erica! 
Beer options 5/5
Atmosphere 5/5

Server Erica was fantastic. The food seems to always have a little kick (heat, spice - although I'm loving it and really am getting accustomed to it) but I always ask for it on the side just in case and Erica made sure the order came out just right. I also asked for no cashews - and Lo-and behold...there weren't any! =] Little things like this go such a long way for me, as I can't tell you how many times I'll say \"please no ____\" (preference, not allergy) and I find it in my dish. 

This evening has the crispy chicken cashew bowl. Thought it was delicious and very filling. 
Boyfriend had the Buffalo Chicken Sliders (comes with 3) and he ended up ordering a 4th. Loved them!"}
{"text":"Definitely a good alternative to MTK brunch as there isn't an insane 1.5 hour wait for a table for 2 at 11 am, but food was average.  Maybe ordered the wrong things .  location was good, service good, food missed the mark."}
{"text":"In a nutshell: excellent service, great quality food, Filipino inspired food.

Okay so my girlfriend and I stumbled across The Craft, and let me just say we were both in a god awful mood when we arrived because we were starving and the lineups at the Mac n Cheese festival were too long for us to bear. We were greeted by friendly hostesses and were provided solid service and recommendations from our waiter. This place reminds me of a good version of Beer Market without the pretentious feel and with added quality and service. 

A lot of the menu is Filipino inspired. Apparently the head chef is Filipino. My girlfriend is Filipino and I'm half, so we were excited to try a lot of the menu items. We ordered the lumpia for appetizer. It was fckin awesome! Regular lumpia is just basically a meat-filled spring roll. This had a bit of spice to it and was served with a spicy dip (not sweet and sour). I'd highly recommend it!! The girlfriend got the Shortrib Tacos and I got the Chili Cheeseburger and shared side garlic fries. Before leaving we had to try the Chicharron... it is very far from traditional, but let me tell you.. it's the perfect snack while downing a beer. Really tasty, they should change the name to taste-icles. 

Overall, we were impressed by everything and our experience turned our crappy day into a great one. Reasonable prices too! I'm sure this place will become more popular as time goes by for both foodies and beer-lovers. Go now before or you'll be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"An old friend was visiting from out of town and staying in Liberty Village, with only a couple hours to spare for a quick catch-up, so I volunteered to venture south across the train tracks and meet her somewhere in that hood. Both beer lovers, we decided on The Craft because it boasts 120 draft options. 

The beer selection was in fact impressive, and I loved my sour beer (The Skull Pucker from 5 Paddles). The menu was less impressive, but maybe if you are a big meat-eater you'd be more into it. I ordered a kale caesar salad that I ended up sending back because it tasted kinda fishy - maybe they use a lot of anchovy in the dressing? I very rarely send food back because I truly hate waste, but I wasn't eating much of it and the server was observant enough to notice I was struggling. She was also kind enough to take it off my bill and offer a substitute. 

I wasn't super won over by the vibe in general; it just felt a little generic. But if all you're after is a burger and a wide beer selection in a big ole space, this spot might be just what you need."}
{"text":"So I wanted to order the BBQ Miso Salmon, and I mentioned that I couldn't have heavy dairy such as coconut milk or butter. I asked for regular rice instead, and they came back later saying that their rice was PRE-MADE so they couldn't make the substitution. 

Honestly, even if it was tasty, for the price I'm paying and the vibe of the restaurant, I did not expect The Craft to be serving fast food. Furthermore, when I asked for a difference carb like bread instead, they gave me buttered bread. What part of dairy free did they miss? 

The wait staff were still very patient with me and incredibly courteous, but the mistakes coupled with their questionably (priced/designed) menu mark The Craft as a place I'll probably not come back to."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. The food was fantastic. Lots of space. Their waffle and fried chicken BLT was the best I've had, and the salmon Benedict was very well done too. 

Service was great and doesn't hurt having 120 beers on tap!"}
{"text":"The beer flights are great; they have TONS on tap. The food was average, I shared garlic fries, nacho chips and chicken bites. I feel like the place doesn't have clear brand direction."}
{"text":"Been here several times and in the beginning it was great, but most recent experience has changed all that.  I will try another visit and update my review but I think you will agree why I am leaving this review.  The management left such a bad impression on us.
4 of us attending a TFC game, arrived several hours before the game as we have done in the past.  Ordered Lumpia and Nachos that are usually really good, this time they came out and they were not at all the quality I am used to.  Then we received our food and all 4 of us agreed we were not impressed.  I had the chicken wings and left 2 because they were a strange consistency and the flavor wasn't very good.  Other friend had the same and felt the same way.
During the meal, still wasn't busy, but our server was nowhere to be seen.  We asked 2 other servers nearby to help us order beer to which they both insisted they couldn't take our order, not their table.  The 2nd server we asked, went to the manager standing right behind our table and still nothing. 
Finally, our waitress must have received the order from one of the other servers, and delivered the beer with an explanation the she had been working all day and needed a brake.  I don't think she was doing a poor job, but I do think the support from management was lacking.  The entire time we were there, the manager stood behind us, ignoring the fact that we had no beer, stacks of plates and had stopped 2 other servers.
As we left, I discussed this with that manager.  He appeared to be disinterested about our concerns and not so much as a sorry.  The true measure of service is how they react when something goes wrong.
We left and went to another bar on the way to the game and they were more than happy to take our money for a beer."}
{"text":"The location is pretty new but none the less is pretty great. The food was tasty and they even considered a dietary request from one of our friends and made them a customer all beef burger rather than a half pork/half beef.

Their beer selection is quite large and the servers knew their stuff to recommend a selection for your meal.

The menu is their weakest point. Basically only burgers, some flat breads and a few high end main dishes. I'd like to see a bigger variety and selection out of a pub."}
{"text":"The food here is good but the service can be terrible.

I have eaten at this restaurant three times, and two of those times I had a bad waitress.

Just recently the waitress acted as if my friend and I were inconveniencing her when we needed her to take our order, she never smiled, and she was quite poor in terms of the level of service she offered (or did not offer for that matter).

Food is good, but the service is not. 

Good luck!"}
