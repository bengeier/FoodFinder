{"text":"To me, this is the only sandwich place in Kent. Do not even bother with the rest, let them fade into the night. They've always treated me well and the food has never disappointed, ever. The salads, the chip selection, bar none. And they deliver!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting family in Chargin Falls and much to our surprise we stumbled upon a tie-dye painted store front in this tiny \"Americana\" town. Being that we live near SF, we were drawn to it like a moth to the light. Dave was pleasant  (I'm not sure why others have called him a jerk...) and we chatted about the Bay Area. I ordered the San Fran sub and it was AMAZING. My hubby ordered the Rueben and said it was one of the best he's had. It was interesting to find a little piece of Berkeley in the middle of Cleveland, but was a welcomed find! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Quintessential stoner sub shop.  Awesome cheap sandwiches, friendly staff.  Plus, they deliver, which is cool 'cause there's only two tables."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are super overrated... Also if you like to see what a person looks like on lsd and being hit on by all their staff visit here... Overpriced too"}
{"text":"Nice sunrise. We went there for the waterfall and found Dave's.  Considering that I had no idea it was here it was great.  Had the Sloppy. And it was as advertised. Would defiantly go back if we were in the area."}
{"text":"I live in Chicago and visit Cleveland two or three times a year.  I used to get a Dave's sub at least once a week when I lived in Cleveland.   I always get the same thing:  Dave's Far Out Chicken, the #4.  The best sandwich made by anyone ever.  My mouth is watering thinking about it.  I want a Dave's in Chicago!"}
{"text":"I am in love with these subs. The bread is delicious and I love Dave's cosmic dressing that they use on the subs. The bomb, I eat the crazy Dave which is nice and spicy. 

Great spot, try a crazy Dave!"}
{"text":"I normally don't like pickles but don't believe the people  that hate their pickles. I absolutely love them. In fact it is the only pickles I eat."}
{"text":"The Super Dave might be the best sub ever.  Love the food there, very cool atmosphere and the music is always on point.  I'll never go to Subway unless there just isn't a Dave's around.

DO NOT change a thing."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find Dave's in Mentor. I'm in the area for a short period, and I did a yelp search to find somewhere good to eat, and, lo and behold, here's a Dave's!

You know how there are restaurants that you hold near and dear to your heart? Places that you wish you could take with you when you move out of town?

Dave's Cosmic Subs has been that restaurant for me for the past couple of years. I lived around the corner from the Dave's in Cleveland Heights for a few years, and then I moved to Columbus and dreamed of opening a franchise just so I could eat the Veg Out whenever I wanted. 

Now, I'm back in NE Ohio, and I live nearby, and - better yet! - I work within delivery distance of a Dave's that I never knew existed. 

It's kismet."}
{"text":"Right to the point: tasty subs at reasonable prices. I've never left Dave's disappointed either in Lakewood or Coventry."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get subs! i always get the number 1. the bread is perfect italian bread, crusty on the outside and soft inside. the employees are always super friendly and i dont mind waiting for them to make my sub because the atmosphere is so cool and interesting. definitely my fav sub place in mentor."}
{"text":"Love the veggie patty sub! We go 20 minutes out of our way to stop here.. Delicious pickles and friendly staff. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Good bread. Courteous service. A bit pricey, but I'll pay that price to support a local business. Just put the right sub in the right bag next time. These things happen, just thought they should know."}
{"text":"Dave, you personally humilliated me and my family yesterday accusing us of trying to steal chips.  You yelled to your cashier, \"Did she pay for those?\"  I will never step in any of your shops again.  Hey, maybe don't accuse your family patrons of stealing, maybe help your staff instead of soliciting franchises and maybe don't go OCD on your cashier as to where the tickets should go.  He seems to have it figured out as he assured us we could go look at the Falls and pick up our chips when we got our sandwiches.  My sandwiches aren't ever right anyway, so not much of a loss.  Easy mayo usally means a 1/2 cup of mayo.  
You ride around in your fancy Mercedes with you disgusting vanity plate taking up 2 spots.  Get over yourself, you aren't all that and a bag of chips!"}
{"text":"I've tried this a few times on the basis of good reviews, but I've never had a sub beyond \"Meh\"

Very oily it seems.  I wish I loved it as much as others seem to"}
{"text":"Really wish I could say good things about this place. But, I can't. The sandwiches are overcooked and hardly edible. The sauce and pickles are good though, so they get 2 stars."}
{"text":"I Want My Dave's Cosmic Subs!!! Sounds familiar to \"I want my MTV?\" Well, it should and will, once you've looked through the peak hole in the wildly, psychedelic painted front door, with its small peak hole, where you first see the face of The Beatles, John Lennon, painted on the side of the Coke cooler. So you open that door, hearing the rhythmic beat of Retro Rock and Roll and you don't know what to do first? You're so hungry, but your eyes travel over the paintings on the ceiling of Rock legends and totally feel you're in The Zone. Now, walk up to that counter and look at the wall of fame! The mouth-watering menu of Dave's Cosmic Subs!!! Whether you like your Sub loaded with meat or your tastes look to simpler pleasures and prefer Vegetarian or Vegan, Dave's Cosmic Subs is here for you! Have a sweet tooth? Dave's Cosmic Subs has that covered too!!! Brownies? They've got 'em!!! Chocolate Chip Cookies??? Yep! They've got those too! You're at your destination, so look no more and you'll soon be saying, \"I Want My Dave's Cosmic Sub!\""}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great, and the atmosphere is unique (in a good way.) But i asked for my sandwich without horseradish sauce and Dave turned into a total jerk, like he took it personally, anyway the food is great, but if Dave is there don't say the wrong thing..."}
{"text":"Excellent sub shop, great service & great food. I had the veg out & added avocado for $1.80 extra. A little pricey but worth it. Add a water & a bag of kettle chips (yum try the cracked pepper, sea salt or vinegar--they had 5 or 6 types) was all about $10.50. Great deal for the amount of food. I ate 1/2 the sub at 11 & the other 1/2 for an afternoon snack. Great bargain!!"}
{"text":"I have been to other Dave's locations and have found the subs to be a notch above average, and I am a fan of their sub sauce.  I tried the Kent Dave's, however, and received a bun so hard that when you tapped on it, it sounded like you were knocking on wood. 
I pointed this out to the clerk who offered to re-make it, but said that the bread isn't really stale, \"it just gets that way a few minutes after it's been baked\". So I guess if you like really hard, brittle buns, this is your place. 
I was also unimpressed when a staffer walked by my table, asked how my food was, and when I gave a most unenthusiastic \"ok I guess\" ; he replied  \"great\" and walked away, as if I had just offered high praise (he was clearly not listening). Whoever handles franchises should check out the Kent location and help them get their act together.
Customers, meantime, should do themselves a favor and walk a block north to the Franklin Deli instead, where they you'll get a much better product. You'll soon see why it's hard to get a seat at Franklin Deli, but everything is empty at Dave's--even though they only have 4-5 small tables you'll be able to find at seat at the height of the lunch hour. This, too, should tell them they're doing something wrong, but they seem both clueless and unconcerned."}
{"text":"Eh...not a fan. Fun place inside, freindly staff but the subs are just not that good. The buns are crunchy on non bake subs...like stale crunchy. Rather the cheese be sliced and inside the sub not shredded and placed on top. Subs just seem to be built wrong."}
{"text":"Hit or miss depending on who is making the sub. Nothing has stood out to me (maybe the Grateful Dave), the bread is often a bit hard. They also cleaned up the walls which was a let down."}
{"text":"My weekly trips to this part of Ohio (from Minneapolis) are always brightened by a sandwich from Dave's.  Fast, friendly service and always fresh and tasty ingredients.  The bread is super fresh with a nice crusty texture.  Love the Dave's sauce.  I get an extra on the side to compliment each bite."}
{"text":"OUTRAGEOUS
The best most fantastic sub you will ever eat. Never go anywhere else, nothing will compare.
The special sauce will blow your mind.
A W E S O M E.
oh, and the pickles are fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Inconsistent. 

Ok, there is one constant at this location- grumpy teenage staff. Service + quality vary greatly. The Chagrin Falls and Shaker locations are much better. Love the Dave's sauce and the gardenburger... Just wish they were as reliable as other locations."}
{"text":"The bread on their sandwiches was inedible; very hard and stale. Management indicated this is their \"signature.\" The manager wasn't friendly and the service was poor. I ate the insides out of my sandwich with a fork. It was a tiny, expensive salad."}
{"text":"The food is decent but it's incredibly vexing how their iPad is never turned on or set up for use with Belly (a frequent customer app where you accrue points for each visit that can be redeemed for free food/drink/merch). I know it's poor conduct and unhelpful to others to write an entire review just to complain about a single thing, but the past half dozen times I've been here they don't have the app up and running... not only can you not accrue points, but you can't redeem points you've built up either. SO, if you're thinking about coming to Dave's to use your points for a free lunch (like yours truly has done), you'll be unpleasantly surprised to find that you can't.

THAT SAID, the food is good, Expensive, yes (again, why it's important that they have their iPad/Belly app running!), but good... and by good I mean you'll like the food if you're into crusty sandwich bread that MAY be too small for the amount of ingredients that go into them (no really, your meat/lettuce and any sauce will shoot out of the bun as soon as you take your first bite). I'm not used to having to be strategic about how I eat my food, but with these subs you'll need to vigilant. Every sandwich comes with a pickle spear. I typically hate pickles but these ones are extremely good for some reason. I mentioned this to the owner years and years ago (I used to frequent the Chagrin Falls store where he works) and mysteriously his stores began selling jars of their pickles. Not saying I'm the reason why, but who knows.

BOTTOM LINE, don't come to this location if you're hoping to cash in on those Belly points.The pickles are the bomb, but my girlfriend is convinced they are more cucumbers than pickles... that may be so, but they are still hella good."}
{"text":"Just amazing. The bread will tear the roof of your mouth up but it's so worth it. Hmm mmm!"}
{"text":"The subs aren't bad. I have to agree with some of the other reviews that the bread is pretty hard and the subs can be messy. I ordered delivery quite a few times, but then they randomly told me one day that I was outside of their delivery zone. I let them know that I had been ordering delivery for a while, it was never an issue before. I was told that in the future, they probably wouldn't deliver to me. I haven't ordered from them since."}
{"text":"Excellent subs of every variety.  Truly cosmic corned beef sandwiches too!  Very friendly counter people.  Wish they offered fries, but that's a small negative compared to the high quality subs and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Expensive sandwich. Food is decent, but this is the second time I waited over 30 minutes for a sandwich. If your looking for something quick this is definitely not the place."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Dave's when I made a trip to Chagrin Falls to visit another eatery.  I ended up getting the Dave's Cordon Bleu and some root beer.  The bread was the best part of this sandwich.  It was crusty, but not too hard...I don't know if I can adequately describe the bread, but I really loved it.  The sandwich itself was good, but there was a bit too much sauce on it.  But I would go back and try another sub."}
{"text":"If zero was an option I would give it zero. The bread cut the roof of my mouth was so rock hard. It was slopped together garbage. I go out to get something that is better than I can make at home. Stay away becuase I will never go back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my sub and the ambiance. Cool pictures of some classic rockers. The sandwich was above average but the special sauce is what makes this place. Not sure what it is but I'd buy it in a bottle if offered."}
{"text":"Their vinaigrette-type sauce absolutely makes these sandwiches. Highly recommend the Crazy Dave. The chick who works there during the day is super-friendly and they're fast. Maybe a tad too expensive, but what's your alternative? Jimmy John's? Please."}
{"text":"It's a decent sub, nothing special. Palatable, nice bread.  Definitely a step above Jimmy Johns.  Plus it's locally owned.  I liked it and will go back and will include it in places I eat at."}
{"text":"Unfortunately underwhelming. Fries were ok, but expensive for the amount. 

Bread was crunchy to the point of being stale. Sandwiches were ok, but unoriginal flavors. Staff was friendly, but overall experience left something to be desired."}
{"text":"The subs are delicious. Unfortunately, the University Heights location is very poorly run. On numerous occasions, they have closed before their scheduled closing time even after we have confirmed the time by calling. On one occasion we called to check the closing time, told them we were going to call right back  with an order and they failed to answer the phone well within the next few minutes. We gave also experienced very rude employees."}
{"text":"Dave's Cosmic Subs are top notch, and I must say that this location is my favorite on the east side. They always seem to get the ratio of ingredients just right and the atmosphere is calm."}
{"text":"I've always loved the food at Dave's Cosmic Subs - truly a unique sub shop in a crowded sandwich restaurant market.  Whether I get the #9 or Turkey Dave, it always hits the spot.  

What's even better is that the Dave's Cosmic Subs in Coventry started running a SMS text program in the last month or 2.  Basically, you text a keyword (COSMIC DAVE) to 216-592-8501 and then you get offers for free things sent to your phone usually once a week. They offered a free 8\" sub for joining the list just 2 weeks ago!  This past week they offered a buy one, get one half off!  Great subs, and giving away free things = WIN."}
{"text":"Great subs, loyal customer, but they're pricing themselves out of the market. Just ordered a large sub which my 4 month old menu says is 10.99, pricey as is. When I picked it up it was 11.99, and I'm thinking I had an old menu. When I picked up a current menu it also said 10.99, so I said wait a minute, why am I charged 11.99? The guy behind the counter explains that the printer screwed up the prices. So why would you not explain to that customers when they order? And why would you not at least hand correct the menus?

They seem to continue to do a brisk business but I have to predict their downfall if this is how they do business."}
{"text":"The subs are good, just a little expensive (for sandwiches).  If you want a step above Subway this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Dave's Veg-Out is one of my favorite sandwiches ever! The Haight is also good. I love the bread, all the cheese, the artichokes, the peppers, and the cosmic sauce. Now, I know it's just Italian dressing, but it is the perfect recipe. The pickles are really good also.

As much as I like Dave's I have one complaint about this location. It closes at 3:00 pm!!! Really? Some nights before a game or concert there is not enough time to sit down at a restaurant so I opt for takeout. I do love J. Gumbo's but sometimes I want a cosmic sub! Please Dave, if you can, stay open a little later."}
{"text":"Way over priced.  Every time I go in I am always disappointed. I am not really sure why I gave them as many chances as I did."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Took 30 minutes for three subs - unacceptable. Cashier was inconsiderate of the wait time."}
{"text":"Walked in to a pretty cool atmosphere; I like the Rock/Pop Memorabilia & loud (but conversation-friendly volume) rock music playing. Staff was nice & friendly.  Menu easy to read. 
Told them not to toast my sub, but they did. 2 POINTS: First: Always go back or send it back if it's not right.  I didn't, thinking, they'd have to make a whole new sub; Got to remember what I want is the MOST IMPORTANT.  Second:  Subs are without a doubt, better with soft bread; easier on your mouth, plus the sub ingredients are better contained within the sandwich. The bite pressure on a crispy bun presses the sauces/ ingredients outward, making a messy situation, where a softer, untoasted bun keeps the good stuff where you want - in your sandwich. 
    Good thing for Dave's Cosmic Subs downtown Chagrin Falls is not a dining market in which many chain restaurants are allowed to compete.  Every time I've eaten in CF, reflecting on my experiences at a similar-level chain restaurant convinces me to eat somewhere else, then enjoy the river, sunshine, etc.  The only positive distinction that could be made in this regard is if the individual, CF restaurants presented exclusively organic ingredients, since most larger dining retailers use Gordon Food Service (preservatives ).
     MAIN POINT:  a Subway in downtown Chagrin Falls would be great; they have specials, a little cheaper, great breakfasts. No rock cool rock music, but that's an ok trade off for a sub that tastes at least as good as Dave's, for less money.  One more option for Chagrin Falls Sandwich Diners is the Moroccan buffet, sandwich shop in the park. Awesome sandwiches there. If I had to do it again, I would've purchased a sub to go at the Pepper Pike Subway, taken it to Chagrin Falls"}
{"text":"Tons of choices and its the place my brother in law makes sure he goes to in Cleveland which is why I ate there. My only compliant is I expected the sandwich to be hot but it wasn't. I found out you can request to make any sandwich hot. Very hippie."}
{"text":"Oh, Grateful Dave. I've tried others, but none so fantastic as you."}
{"text":"This is the most garbage Daves Cosmic Subs I have ever been too. The tasty bacon was a tiny crumpled piece of bread hardly six inches long and the pickles look like they have been left in a sauna. The people who work there are kids and do not value their jobs or customers that give them business. This Daves makes all the others look bad and needs to be shut down. Oh and the bread is past due and very stale. DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here...got dave's far out chicken recommended by hipster boy at the counter. The description says \"juicy chicken\" with Dave's #9 hot sauce. I said I wanted a sandwich with lots of meat. When I got the sandwich it was loaded with melted cheese, hot sauce, and one slice of deli chicken meat. NOT what I had in mind....I just ate it and I'm still hungry. Boo...."}
{"text":"I had a dreadful experience.  I called in my order and was told it would be ready in about 15 minutes.  I got there a little early and they hadn't started the order.

While waiting I watched one of their employees sweeping the floor, which is good.  He then proceeded to help prepare my sandwiches- without washing his hands.  Ugh.

They batted 1 for 3 on the sandwiches.  My wife liked her HeyDave.  My daughter rejected her meatball sandwich.  I'll have it for lunch tomorrow.  She's picky and her tastes may not match mine.

What was the worst was my sandwich, a Far Out Chicken.  I more than once specified no Banana Peppers.  Yet there they were, discovered by biting into one.

The kitchen crew should be terminated before they entirely destroy the store.  As for me, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Really nice menu and the food is decently priced. Sandwiches come cold so if you want them hot ask first. Had Dave's Original and it's great with a tasty sauce. 
Seating is nice but kind of small. Overall a nice place for lunch."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for the amount of food that you get for your money! Subs are so-so, nothing spectacular!"}
{"text":"I have been going to a Dave's for quite a few years.  This could have, no was the worst sandwich ever from a Dave's .  Ordered a tuna sub and the amount of tuna on the sandwich was ridiculously small.  It might have been called a lettuce sandwich with tuna flavoring.  I did email the store, took some time to get back to me, but they did offer a new sandwich.  Only way they answered me was that I was going to tell Dave himself!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of sub sandwiches but this place just doesn't do it for me.  I have tried it several times based on it's reputation and on my most recent visit I waited 15 minutes for one sandwich.  I even timed it because it was so slow the last time I was there.  Given that I also had to park on the third level of a parking garage turned this into a 30 minute trip just to pick up a sandwich.  The food itself is okay but it is not strong enough to overcome such a long wait and the parking is an absolute nightmare."}
{"text":"I love Dave's and the subs are great! But this location is poorly run. Not only did the person taking my order never share it with the person making the subs, but to top it all off, when I got home they had given me the wrong subs. I know people make mistakes and this happens sometimes, but this is the second time I've been to this location and they've gotten my order wrong. The last time I watched them write down the correct numbers only to get the wrong subs in the bag. I think the management better step in and supervise a bit more because I've seen many poor reviews of this location."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. I would give it 3 (only cause it wasn't terrible) but I only give three and above if I'd return. I don't ever want to eat here again. The food was not gross. BUT it was very average. And especially for the price. I was unimpressed. I would rather eat a sandwich at home. I'm glad I tried it so I won't make the same mistake twice."}
{"text":"As much as I like the atmosphere of the Dave's in Hudson better, the Macedonia Dave's is much closer. Same fantastic quality of food, same super friendly service. Have never had a bad experience at Dave's, even with years and years of visits to multiple locations. My favorite place to grab lunch in Macedonia for sure. (get the turkey dave!!)"}
{"text":"You know those days that you just CANNOT with your life? Those mornings that you struggle to get out of bed, fight downtown Cleveland traffic and drag yourself into the office, only to sit next to a cubicle mate that insists on clipping his fingernails before you've had your first cup of Joe? Rejoice! You have something to look forward to! You now have reason to exist! Dave's Cosmic Subs, located conveniently downtown will bring purpose to your lunch and life. I've tried several sandwiches and my favorite is the Far Out Chicken Sub with extra peppers and cosmic sauce (because why wouldn't you get extra?) It is the most delicious sandwich that I've had in Cleveland.  The only thing I would not recommend on their menu is the coleslaw, which is rather bland. I would also recommend calling ahead because during the lunch rush the wait can get rather long."}
{"text":"Was excited to try a sub from this local, independent joint. The sub was mediocre at best. The sauce, which should be a distinguishing factor in a sub world where all of the ingredients are essentially the same, was bland and tasteless. However the sub roll (bread) was excellent and the rock n roll pictures on the walls were great!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't Yelped about this place yet. I'm in here all the time. Dave's is an excellent local sub shop chain with a location on Main St in Hudson. These are undoubtedly some of the best subs I've ever had. The place is definitely meant to portray a counter-culture hangout, with tye-dye designs on the walls and posters from the 60s and 70s advertising concerts. The music they play is also from the 70s. One of the cool things about this place is you're allowed to put your signature on the walls, as the vast amount of signatures stick out at you as you walk in. The subs are phenominal. Most recently, I had the Dave's Cordon Bleu, with cheese, ham, chicken, Dave's Cosmic Sauce, their signature sauce, and more, all on either white or wheat. Other great options include the Original Dave, the Turkey Dave, and the Incredible Dave, among others. Their whole menu is on their website. Overall, if you're looking for a great sub shop anywhere in Greater Cleveland, head over to your nearest Dave's. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been going to Dave's for years, since they've opened! I always order a Turkey Dave and my husband orders a philly cheese steak! However it does suck their specialty subs only come in one size so my husband has to order 2 of them. The service is always great! I stopped in one day for lunch and they messed up my sub l, so the nice gentlemen behind the counter said I'm so sorry I made a mistake! He said give me ages mins I'll remake it. I was polite said no problem no only did he give me a free sub for next time I came, but also gave me the mistake sub. I ended up walking out with 3 subs! Excellent customer service. As a matter of fact I'm going to get a turkey Dave today! If you're looking for a great sub this is the place to go. Quality ingredients, great crusty fresh bread and AMAZINGLY cosmic sauce!"}
{"text":"Large selection of sandwiches and toppings.  Turkey sandwich was good, the ingredients were fresh but nothing spectacular.  Staff was very friendly and service was quick as food was cooked to order.  Prices were reasonable, but not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"More than once I have gone to Dave's subs only to come home with not the subs I ordered or they only give me two when I order three.  Not worth the aggravation.  No one in the shop, and they still can't get one order correct."}
{"text":"So the Subs are tasty and fresh, especially the bread, but the amount of time it takes and the price are not what I would expect. Every time I go it takes forever. I would recommend toasting your bread. I wish they delivered to near Avon!"}
{"text":"My favorite sub shop.  You can't go wrong with anything that has the cosmic sauce in it. The bread is just right and the combination of meats and cheeses are spot on.  This shop in Hudson has the nice brother/owner who is kind and attentive as opposed to the evil brother/owner in Chagrin Falls who is not unlike the soup Nazi."}
{"text":"Went in here and the owner Dave might be a sociopath.  I saw him yelling at a mother with her child in her arms.  When she showed the slightest hesitation in what she wanted he told her to hurry up, he really didn't care what she ordered, and that she could leave if she wanted.  Go here if you like being yelled at over a sandwich, scratch that, I beg you not to support a mean lunatic.  You're selling sandwichs dude, sorry you're a washed up rock star."}
{"text":"I think this is probably my favorite dave's location.  Great customer service and if your not getting a hot sub they come out very fast.  I've been here a ton and I can't think of one problem what so ever."}
{"text":"They were charging more than the menu price because \"the new sign wasn't in yet\". Who reprograms the computer with different prices than what was clearly on the wall.  Thefranchise owner seemed irritated when this brought to his attention."}
{"text":"There is absolutely no reason to go anywhere else. If you want the best sub in Cleveland, you need to go to cosmic Dave's. I've only ever been at the one at Fairmount Circle, but I assume that the others are equally good."}
{"text":"Oh my, this place is good. The first time I came here I tried the original Dave's Cosmic Sub, and each time I come back, I order the same thing! I really want to try the other sandwiches but the original is just too delicious.... yum! 

The cosmic sauce is the best thing ever, and the bread is delicious too. They have a good number of different subs.. probably 20 or 30 different varieties. It's a little expensive... but worth every penny. I usually order a large for around $10 and it's always big enough for at least two meals!

I highly recommend this place, one of the best sub shops I've been to!"}
{"text":"Not really sure what people see in this place.  The employees are rude and the sandwiches and ok. Not great but ok.  The price they charge is a little steep for what you get.  There are plenty of places around to get a amazing sandwich or  sub that those place really needs to step up their game"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Crunchy bread heaven! It takes longer than most places to get your sandwich after ordering, but when the outcome is so delicious, who am I to complain? 

I have a personal goal to try every sandwich on the menu. Sometimes, you gotta dream big."}
{"text":"Hidden away in Elyria is this gemstone. Great food, helpful staff, amazing atmosphere."}
{"text":"I always get pretty good subs here.  It's pretty rare that I have big complaints.  The ambiance is really cool if you're into music (especially if you like the original Woodstock type of stuff.)  Staff was always nice and it's never too busy. 

Positives:
They have a huge selection to suit a lot of different tastes.  Most subs are really good.  They are pretty big.
Negatives:
Not enough meat.  I like a NY style sandwich with a huge amount of meat on it.  DAve's has more fixins than actual meat, so that's a negative for me."}
{"text":"Zesty is a made up media word but I think it applies here. The food here is delicious and very flavorful. The service is fine and the food is awesome."}
{"text":"Dave's is fantastic. 
The Crocker Park location is run by a great staff that remember their regulars and reward customer loyalty. Dave's is the best sub shop in town!"}
{"text":"Dave's never disappoints. I am a vegetarian and I love the veg out sandwich. It is very satisfying. My husband is a meat eater and he has been happy with all of the sandwiches he has tried. His favorite is the meatball sub!"}
{"text":"Dave's is amazing! I am a vegetarian and I always get the veg out. It's is so satisfying. My husband is a meat eater and always changes it up. He especially loves the meatball sub. In general, we love Daves-it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Our favorite lunchtime place!   Try the gardenburger!  Outstanding flavor (spicey too!)."}
{"text":"Go-to sammy shop in Hudson. Pretty consistent service, good portion/value, and a unique free-spirited vibe inside. Pro tip: call ahead for take-out, especially for lunch, as they get pretty busy."}
{"text":"TURN THE FREAKING MUSIC OFF!!!!! I am SICK of this retarded place playing music outside! 0 stars!"}
{"text":"The subs are great and the selection is huge. It is a nice place to visit and the staff is always friendly.  The only reason why I cannot give it a higher rating is every time I order something here part of the order is wrong. But it is a small price to pay for friendly service and good food."}
{"text":"I ordered a sub from Dave's Cosmic Subs. I got to my office, I decided to eat it later in the day. It was not what I expected the bread was a brick and I love artisan breads, but it wasn't artisan bread. I am in the restaurant and retail business and if someone calls and complain about a brick then I would do anything to make that person happy anyway, I can.
Austin whom ever he is said to me that Dave toasts he's breads and that's why it was a brick even though I saw him put it the microwave. All Austin could say was Sorry it might of been toasted for awhile. Great!!  I won't be sorry for Dave if he is no longer in Kent or out business. You make things right!!!! Get it! Good luck I hope your Chagrin Falls location is not doing this to its customers. It would be a shame."}
{"text":"Good subs.

Large sub sandwiches with fresh deli meat and heaping of toppings. Beware large is acutally 2 normal sized subs. Bread is nice and crusty. Convenient consistent if not healthy fast meal option."}
{"text":"I'm not from the area and stumbleg across this little spot. It's a really cool place with very creative subs.  Quality sub for a decent price. Cool environment as well. Great subs!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience, I've had in a long time.  My husband and I were just in there for lunch we ordered two sandwiches, a meatball and a Super Dave.  Mind you the meatball sandwich was suppose to be served hot.  We waited over 20 minutes for our order, as I was standing in line to cancel it and get my $17.00 refunded, the sandwiches come out, after 6 people who came into the place after we did received their orders.  I took one bite out of my $7.50 meatball sandwich it was stone cold and watery, I then proceeded to throw it in the trash.  Disorganized mess of a place and will never return.  I'm being generous with a one star, if I could I would give it NO stars."}
{"text":"Looks like a sandwich shop from the 70s. It has g large menu friendly workers and an impressive array of custom sodas. The sandwiches are also delicious. If you want a sandwich with more kick then subway or jimmy johns then this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I just visited Dave's for the first time.  I had the Height Ashbury.  It was a great sandwich with fresh quality ingredients.  Dave's sauces rock and the special marinated tomatoes were hella good!  

The good ol' Grateful Dead music playing in the background along with the old Ameba Records shirt hanging on the wall made me miss San Francisco.

Thanks Dave!"}
{"text":"Best sub's ever! Pricey..yes, but so tastey! A trip up to mentor always results in a roast beef sub with coleslaw and fries on it! Very filling and much fresher tasting than other sub stores"}
{"text":"Been going here for years.  Best subs in town, people are always nice and service is quick.  Can't go wrong here, seriously, a no brainier for subs!"}
{"text":"I should get free subs here for life from all the people I have turned on to this place.  Of course I always give Very Specific directions on how and what to order!!  The truth is I have only eaten ONE sub at Daves.  The Grateful Dave Sub...Mmmmm! 
Oddly enough, it is usually hand-written on a piece of paper instead of being with the other menu items....It is a turkey sub and the whole reason I ordered it in the first place is because it has avocado on it...yum.  The Dave sauce and the rest of the veggies with the crispy roll are heavenly!  
It comes with a pickle on the side, I do not know what kind of pickle it is, not a dill, not sweet...but perfect for this sandwich!
Everyone I have taken to Daves and insisted that they get the Grateful Dave has been very...well, Grateful!!!!
So if by chance Dave is reading this review, just know that I have single handedly made about a dozen new fans of your restaurant!   And I encourage all to try this place...just make sure the first sub you try is the Grateful Dave...you know why!"}
{"text":"Ok first time here. Recommended by my daughter. I got their \"23\" which is their club. So so good. I love the Dave's cosmic sauce. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is different for sure...Cosmic Dave...I get it now :) Sandwiches have two choices for bread...white or wheat....it is sooo yummy too. Love the special \"dave sauce\" still trying to figure out just what it was. He has it bottled so you can take it home and add it to your sandwiches too :) 
Turkey Dave & Dave's Club were both very yummy sandwich choices for us."}
{"text":"There is never any shortage of sub places it seems anywhere you go these days.  What's great about Dave's is despite this over saturated market, they still seem to offer a unique sub experience.  This place has a hippie theme going which is different than most and gives more of a one off vibe then your traditional chain restaurant.  I had the 'Original' sub and it was very tasty.  It was also a good value with the price being about what you would see for that size sub.  I will definitely be returning to try more subs."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever tried any Dave's Cosmic Subs location. I was hankering for something cheap and quick after a long week of work, and called in an order to Dave's. I got an Original Dave's Cosmic Sub. 

For 6 bucks, I was expecting something tasty but not necessarily outstanding....and I was pretty much right. The subs were packed, which was nice, but the fillings are your standard, run-of-the-mill, bulk bagged ingredients. Pre-shredded lettuce and cheese, average deli meats, and bland unidentifiable herb flakes. My cosmic sauce was also unevenly spread on one side of the sub which made a mouthful of mozz, salami, pepperoni, and prosciutto kinda dry at first. The pickles were also bland and wimpy. Still, when you put all these ingredients together for a cheap eat, you've got a decently yummy sub that's hard not to devour quickly. 

Overall I'd definitely go back to Dave's cause it's a quick and easy bite for lunch or dinner. The subs might not have the freshest or highest quality ingredients but they are a step above your run of the mill deli subs and the price is right. The Elyria location also has a convenient drive-thru (order ahead by phone) for rainy and lazy days. The service is efficient and friendly, and the decor that I peeked from the drive-thru window seemed cool in the kitschy 60s way."}
{"text":"1.5 Stars.

Sandwiches are my favorite food.  I really wanted this place to be good and I gave it a couple tries.  Unfortunately, it is just extremely OVERRATED.

Why?  Terrible bread.  Gross sauce and too much of it.  

The effort to be an earthy 60's psychedelic music-themed joint appears to me to be a weak and transparent front, and is poorly executed at this location.  This place wouldn't last a month in Portland, OR.  Just sayin."}
{"text":"i hadn't had dave's in years, but a co-worker suggested heading over there when teahouse noodle's line was out the door.  what i remember about previous experiences at dave's:  their subs were to die for.  amazing. big. delicious.  and a bit pricey.

but my trip back (aaawww snap-bad pun intended) proved this partially true.  the subs were ok.  they were decent sized.  not too over priced.  worthy of the price tag, i guess.

i like things that remind me of living in san francisco. dave's does that.

and their haight ashbury sub is veggie goodness in my mouth.
i'm not completely veg, but this thing says sure, it's ok, you'd be good without the meat.

that's what she said."}
{"text":"I found me a new love at Dave's Cosmic Subs.  Yes I did its The Super Dave.
Check this out.

Pastrami, Corned Beef, Mayo, Lettuce, Mustard, Tomatoes, and its topped with Dave's Homemade Cole Slaw with Dave's Cosmic Sauce.

Yes WINNER WINNER....  I do think you should give it a try.  Cole Slaw on a sandwich is the way to ROLL.   This Yelper is one happy camper."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Dave's Cosmic Subs.  I had a Super Dave, and it was absolutely the best sub I've ever had!  The coleslaw was amazing.  I would totally go back just to get a side of the slaw.  I really loved the texture of the bread - it was sturdy and chewy (not soft and wimpy like Subway), but not crispy/flakey either.  And I also really liked the Dave's cosmic sauce, which was similar to Italian dressing.  I really appreciated the way the sandwich was assembled - bread, then sauces, then lettuce/tomato, then meat, then slaw.  I liked that there were flavorful things both on top and beneath the meat, and I always prefer when the sauces are adjacent to both bread and lettuce.  Another huge plus for me was the birch beer in the soda fountain.  An unexpected opportunity to try something new is always great for me!

I typically only give 5 stars to places that are consistently excellent, but I didn't think it was fair to knock off a star simply because I've only been here once.  I have nothing to complain about, and my experience was far better than I had expected."}
{"text":"I had been hearing about Dave's from my parents for almost a year, so I decided to finally go there. I ended up going to the one in Kent because the one in Hudson closed at 8 p.m. (weird to me that it closes that early). I got one of the turkey subs (there are so many options there, the menu can be overwhelming). It was a decent sub - the bread was a little hard, and it was incredible messy. I also got a black cherry pop with it, which was probably the highlight of the meal. The service while I was there was pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"Great find in the Cleveland area if you are looking for a great sub that has it's own style. Good atmosphere with deep music history roots. Support local forget subway you will be impressed."}
{"text":"Anyone who says that Dave's has \"the best subs around\" or that they are better than DiBella's is CRAZY! 

I mean, I rarely complain when it comes to sandwiches. But there was something so odd about this sandwich. It was pretty much a turkey and cheese with some fixin's. The guy kinda gave me a hard time (well, maybe he was just mocking me) about taking things off or substituting them. But in the end he knew better than to argue with a pregnant lady waiting to get her sandwich on. So I switched the Swiss to provolone and asked for no banana peppers. 

We waited way too long for these sandwiches. They were not exciting in the least! The cheese was shredded, like on frozen pizza. The turkey itself was good and not at all slimy (big plus), but Dave's \"cosmic sauce\" was like salty Italian dressing and there was way too much of it. The bread was boring. Plus, I like to have options when it comes to sandwiches, and these subs, while chock-full of ingredients, were not exactly appealing to me. There was nothing I'd want to have exactly as-is without making changes. And there's only one bread option, the sorta bland Italian bread without much character.

I generally hated the decor and theme of this place too. Maybe I just think the '60s are played out. Sorry to be like that, but it's just not my taste or style. 

The bottle of water I had was delicious, though."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. I love Subway, but Dave's Cosmic Subs blows them out of the water. I had the Super Dave and can't wait to try the others. If I had to have one con about the place, it would be there aren't any near me in Illinois. Best subs in Mentor, no question."}
{"text":"My wife and my sons took a trip up to crocker park today. We decided on eating at Dave's cosmic sub's since it would be something new for us. The interior of the restaurant is really clean. It has a nice atmosphere with all of the posters and memorabilia on the walls. Kind of small inside but that makes sense since there are about 4 tables outside to also eat at. Staff is very friendly inside.

I ordered an incredible Dave and my wife ordered a cosmic Dave I believe? (Most sandwiches are some sort of twist with the name Dave) The bread was fresh, filling the cheese was fresh, cool. It all comes together nicely on a cold cut. I'd love to go back since they have a pretty large menu. I'm not sure if they have \"Build your own Dave\" option... That would be a great idea for them though. Overall I loved the sandwich."}
{"text":"I think I like Dave's subs more than Jimmy John's, though I like Jimmy John's for the sprouts and pickles.

Dave's wins on bread, dressing, and overall sandwich crafting! I've never not liked something from here and the sandwiches even keep well. Since I rarely finish my food, it's nice to have a sandwich that doesn't get too soggy, fall apart, and end up so nasty looking that I want to immediately throw it out. The atmosphere is way better than any sub place that I've ever been too, mostly for it's relaxed and unique decor and service. 

I hate being pressured to make a decision and I usually get pressured by the boy because he's normally been to where we go at least once and knows what he wants before he walks in, so it's even worse when servers seem impatient. Dave's is so mellow and the staff is so accommodating when help is desired or when it's not! I feel comfortable taking my time reading the menu as if I will be quizzed on it later!

...yeah I like Dave's more than Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"What happen to my chicken Cobb salad!? Its lettuce has been changed! It went from delicious to disgusting. I have always been satisfied with Panera but not anymore. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great subs...worst pickles ever. Cool classic rock and roll atmosphere at each location. But seriously, probably the worst pickle of all time."}
{"text":"Dave's Subs have really grown on me. The more I have them and try different things on the menu, the more I understand the lure of this sub shop. 

This location is great, if you ask me. The interior is like all others-hippy, tie-dye, music posters, signatures, murals. There's never really a wait. This could be because they make the subs quickly or because I somehow keep missing the lunch rush, but I really don't ever have to waste much of my lunch hour waiting on service or a sandwich here. 

That said, I couldn't tell you what I love more about this place: the service or the sandwiches. The sandwiches are delicious, but the service is just so...HAPPY. Everyone is always happy and curious about what they can do to help you. And every time I tip, I get a huge appreciate smile and thank you, which either tells me people don't tip enough here and they're surprised and need it (that's a whole other rant that I could go into, but will save you) or they really are just geniunely thankful. Either way, after coming here for lunch my day is almost always happier and tastier."}
{"text":"With Jersey Mike and Jimmy John recently opening or going to be opening I am not sure how this place will stay in business.  There subs really aren't anything special and with other options available now I probably won't be going here again."}
{"text":"This my absolute favorite sub shop! I feel like the people who hate Dave's either order wrong or must not be a fan of delicious sandwiches. 

My favorites are #8 The Crazy Dave which is a spicy italian sub with \"Prosciutto, Capicola, Hot Peppers, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions, Fresh Garlic, Provolone Cheese, then Sprinkled With Crushed Red Peppers, Herbs, and Dave's Cosmic Sauce\"  I mean what's not to like!?! Also there is hot giardiniera on top instead of the banana peppers that come on top of some others. If you like spicy mouthwatering delicious sub go for The Crazy Dave. 

My second favorite is #1 The Original- \"Pepperoni, Genoa Salami, Prosciutto, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Sliced Banana Peppers, Onions, Fresh Garlic, Herbs, Provolone Cheese, smothered with Dave's Cosmic Sauce.\" Pretty much a less spicy version of deliciousness for those who like italian subs but can't handle the heat. 

Then there is the Big Dave- this one is another italian sub except HUGE. So, if the other two weren't meaty enough for you or didn't fill you up go for the Big Dave. 

These are just my preferences, I have tried others and liked them, but with these three you can never go wrong. The bread is crispy and fresh, the meat cheese and veggies are plentiful and that delicious Dave's sauce is perfect for these Italian inspired subs.

Hate Italian? Try the Grateful Dave- it's a Turkey sub with avocado and alfalfa sprouts which is really good.

Hate Sandwiches? (why did you come here??) Try the Pizza Sub or Davey Dog both are pretty good! 

Having a hard time deciding with all these choices? Go for The Crazy Dave!!! 

Enjoy"}
{"text":"The Original Dave's Cosmic Subs will always hold a special place in my heart, and no matter what I will always make room in my tummy for one of their sandwiches! I grew up with Dave's as a special treat and whenever I visit town the first thing I want to have on my to-do list is heading to get a sandwich. Every person who asks me where to eat in Cleveland get the \"Go to Dave's\" conversations. 

From their crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside bread to their quality toppings and that mysterious and amazing Dave's Sauce it always satisfies. 

My go to sandwiches are the Italian ones, either the Original or the Crazy Dave- and since I like spicy it usually ends up being the Crazy Dave. While all the sandwiches are great, if you like an Italian style sandwich loaded with cheese, veggies and flavorful salty meats you gotta order one of these. I would literally have one overnighted to me if it were an option- so good! 

While the Original Location here is a slice of sandwich history they've done a great job at having consistency with the franchising, find the location nearest you and try one now! (ask for extra sauce on the side- its so good!!)"}
{"text":"This is a great sub - the service here was pretty amazing as well. I was a little skeptical when I arrived being the store was completely void of any customers. I sat at a table against the wall checking out the memorabilia as they made my sandwich. Although I ordered my sandwich for dine in my #1 Dave's Italian came wrapped in foil then over-wrapped in white butcher paper I chose the toasted option which is available on just about every sandwich even though it may be listed as a cold sub.

Before I could get half way though this beautiful tasty sub the restaurant began to fill up and for good reason. This place Rocks!!!"}
{"text":"One of the better Dave's locations in terms of speed of service and order accuracy.  The bummer?  Where is the cute kids' menu that is at all other Dave's locations?  It is not on a board...only on a printed menu.  Same rock n roll vibe as other locations."}
{"text":"They have decent sandwiches and are a local chain.  The menu is varied and the sandwiches all have names.  Oozing with cleveland \"rock n roll capitol of the world\" pride.  It's a bit kitchy, to be honest, but if you have friends from out of town who really love touristy stuff, you could take them there, although you wouldn't really be able to sit if the one card table they use for guests who decide to eat there is occupied.  

One thing I did not know, until today, was that their hot subs only come in one size, \"regular\", so if you order a \"large\" they will just make you two, and then charge you for two.  Which is a lot different from the usual concept of large, as well as considerably more expensive. As a customer, it would be good to know about this before you go to order a large and end up paying almost $14 for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Love the subs here. It's like eating a rock concert there are so many flavors coming at you."}
{"text":"Dave's cosmic subs are good but very large portion of food. Not sure what to order ask for a recommendation by the staff it's not like a normal subway or jimmy Johns or firehouse subs.

If you never had Dave cosmic sub be sure to drop by and check it out."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty subs!  I would totally recommned Dave's Solon for a healthy dinner or even party trays.  I love that they have a drive through window so that I can pick my order quickly on my way home from work.  Some of my favorite subs: Crazy Dave, Turkey Dave, and Gardenburger Sub.  One word: YUM"}
{"text":"Best subs on town. Hands down. Fresh bread with a soft middle. I'm obsessed with their pickles! I bought a jar just to take home. They have some unique flavors of chips and soda pop. They also have party trays. Perfect for parties or when you just don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"The sandwiches I've tried so far have all been terrific. The pickles however, seem to hardly have been pickled, an in effect, serve no real purpose but to get the wrapping all green and squish-i-fied. I'll admit a certain level of pickle snobbery here, and will forgive this. The new addition of avocado and sprouts to the menu is a special joy.
Subs are big enough for a lunch, dinner, and next day lunch. 
I'm taking them down a star for calling Italian dressing 'Dave's special sauce', but all in all- a damn fine sandwich shop, and in walking distance to work. The name 'cosmic brownie' could be a tad misleading, no?"}
{"text":"My review is for takeout only. My cousin was raving about the sandwiches here so we got sammiches for 8 and gobbled them up back at home. 

I had the Dave's Veg Out and was concerned about \"smothered in Dave's cosmic sauce.\" I shouldn't have been. It was a tasty sandwich and was well dressed and not drowning. My family got a couple of SuperDaves and a Reuben and others. Everyone gobbled them up so the other sandwiches must have been as yummy as mine.

There can be a bit of wait so calling in your order is definitely recommended."}
{"text":"So this was my first time to visit.  I have not been to the original so I don't have anything to compare it to other then other local sandwich shops.  So...... it was awesome.

The place is filled with old rock n roll items and great music.  The sandwich selection is pretty expansive, meat to vedge.

They have great indoor and outdoor seating.

 Am a fan."}
{"text":"We're baaack! Stopped in for a quick to-go between activities and after church today. Co-owner, Camerin, was behind the counter being her typical helpful, friendly and gracious self and Eddie was fielding orders in the kitchen. My wife had her standard Dave's Tasty Bacon (can't get her to branch out but she knows a winner when she tastes one) and I went with #17 Dave's Best Meatball Sub Ever. Both were great and the sauces really make these subs stand out along with in-house baked breads. Outstanding and without peer."}
{"text":"By far my favorite sub shop in Ohio! I love the cosmic sauce! My favorite sub is the incredible Dave and their Greek salad is dlish! Definitely five star worthy!"}
{"text":"Worst of all Dave's locations...Very slow and your order won't be correct.  Such a shame...we love Dave's but we cannot figure out why this location cannot get its act together."}
{"text":"As for subs, Dave's cosmic subs have to be the best you will get around. They even sell their famous cosmic dressing in the heinens Grocers right behind it."}
{"text":"This was my our first time at Dave's Cosmic Subs. It was amazingly good. 3 of us got subs all different ones and they were all amazing! My youngest got a hotdog and it was yummy as well. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I truly do enjoy the subs here, however I think that they're a bit pricey. To get dinner for my fiance and I, I will get a full sub for myself, a half sub for her, and a bag of chips for each of us. This usually comes out to around $23 which I feel is not unreasonable, but still a little pricey for a quick dinner.
The subs still are very good though. If I am able eat mine right away, I will go for the Dave's Cordon Bleu which is served hot, and does not keep as well if I have to drive home after. Otherwise I'll usually go for the Incredible Dave, a chicken sub, or the Dave's World Famous, which has roast beef and chicken. My fiance normally likes the Turkey Dave.
Have your napkins ready as these subs have a hearty portion of ingredients and are slathered in Dave's sauce, which is always tasty, but can become a bit messy. I'm also a fan of how most of the subs include banana peppers, a personal favorite addition to subs.
Overall I like the suns here, I come on occasion when it is convenient for me, but I would come here more often if the subs were a bit more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Good subs, wide selection, and a some kid friendly choices.  Very entertaining walls and ceiling when you eat there, but limited seating."}
{"text":"Ooh, we like us some Dave's.  Why?  The menu is more extensive than you will find at a Jimmy John's, and what's not to love about Dave's sauce which tastes to be a mayo - based sauce with vinegar and oregano?  The bread, eh, I wouldn't say it is better than Di Bella ' s at all but the atmosphere is fun, the sandwiches funky, and what else do you need?"}
{"text":"Never disappointing, always awesome! Only place to get an original sub, love the bread and the Dave sauce.  thanks for making a good day even better!!!!"}
{"text":"i wasn't impressed. the staff was nice and friendly, but my sandwich sorta sucked. most of the menu seemed like a riff on the same basic Italian style sub. 
i did like the bread and the meat but it was mostly lettuce. i'd give it another shot but it was overpriced."}
{"text":"My oh my, if I didnt have a yelp account before I would have opened one just to post this review. The star meter above just rocketed up and exploded for this place. I worked in Cleveland last week (I live/work in Columbus but was helping out of town). 1st time in Cleveland, and damnit this is by far the best sub I have ever had. I had the number 8 recommended by daves son who was working, the crazy dave which had Prosciutto, Capicola, peppers and other goodness....toasty bread....it all went together so well and tasted the way a sub should! This has ruined me for all other sub places as they won't live up to what I had here. My only complaint is thers really no seating....two small tables and a small longer table along the wall with one chair because it looks like its more for ads and fliers, luckily I was able to stay because when I take lunch I like to sit and relax. Other then that, Thanks guys for the best sub ive ever had and hope one day you make it to Columbus (one can hope anyway)."}
{"text":"I had my first sub at Dave's about 9 days ago...
...and since then, I've bought four more of them.

The bread is flaky and crisp on the outside, and soft on the inside. Everything tastes extremely fresh, and I'd venture to say it's literally impossible to make a better sub than what you'd find at Dave's."}
{"text":"Not cosmic, mediocre. How old is that bread? They don't seem to be trying very hard. Shredded mozzarella on an Italian sub?"}
{"text":"Dave's Cosmic Subs is f'ing delicious!

I found Dave's by accident. I was on Coventry Road on my way to Next and I had stopped to let a few people cross the street and my navigation said \"your destination will be on the right\" so I turned and saw Dave's and said I've got to check this place out.

So after I went to Next I was starving so I walked down to Dave's. It's a cute little place. It reminds me a lot of Jimmy John's but Dave's is so much better! Service is quick and there was no wait.

You can choose from either Italian or whole wheat bread, two different subs sizes regular and large and hot and cold subs. I got \"The Super Dave\" which consists of pastrami, corned beef, mayo, lettuce, mustard, cole slaw and Dave's Cosmic Sauce and it was utterly f'ing amazing. The pastrami and corned beef were so tender and juicy.... sorry I was having a moment."}
{"text":"First time here. I eat a lot of subs and this was at best mediocre, although all the glowing reviews say otherwise.

Ordered a Dave's cosmic sub original. Meat seemed cheap (not high quality boars head etc), bread was crispy not soft and, served cold.cosmic sauce is just a creamy Italian dressing with a bunch of cheap meat and bland mozzarella shoved on top . Nothing special at all.

I'm all for supporting small shops with good product but honestly i can get way better Italian sub at GetGo."}
{"text":"Dave's is fantastic! Best subs in the area by far. They have something here for everybody. 

My most recent visit was today with my family. I do have a few picky eaters in my family so even finding a single place we'll all enjoy can be difficult. Luckily, Dave's was right on the money with their sub selection. They have great vegetarian options, delicious deli meats, and a few hot subs. I love their unique options!! I got the Super Dave which was incredible: pastrami, corned beef, their special sauce, and coleslaw piled high on their amazing crusty bread. My family members got the original, the crazy dave, and the dave's far out chicken. They all LOVED the sandwiches and were raving about them. The best part is how reasonably priced all of their options are! 

In addition, the customer service here is spectacular. Our four sandwiches were finished quickly and the woman at the register was fun and helpful! 

The only negative I can think of is the lack of parking but Dave's is definitely the perfect place to stop in for a bite after exploring Crocker Park!"}
{"text":"As far as subs go, there is nothing better than Dave's.  I've been going here since I was eight years old and I always try to keep too much time from passing before going again.  For me, heaven is in the form of a Dave's All American (roast beef, cheddar and jack cheese, thousand island dressing with tomato and lettuce) heated in the oven until the cheese gets a little crispy on the edges.  Wow.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

Anyways, if you've never been to the little store by the falls, you are in for an experience.  Dave has plastered every wall with memorabilia from his hippy days and the stereo always has some great classic rock playing.  Dave is usually behind the counter, harassing customers and yelling at people who try and pay with credit cards, try to mix and match sandwiches, etc.  He can be kind of abusive, and he isn't too shy about his prices, but he knows how to make a sandwich.

If you are in Chagrin Falls (the other locations just aren't as good) and are looking for a fantastic sub, this is the place to go.  A Chagrin Falls tradition that makes us unique and delicious!"}
{"text":"Felt like getting a quick bite to eat, so I figured I'd give Dave's Cosmic Subs a try for dinner.

While I'm giving Dave's Cosmic Subs three stars, I suspect that I may have just ordered the wrong sandwich.  I got the Super Dave (pastrami and corned beef topped with a heaping portion of cole slaw).  While the sandwich was good, the cole slaw overpowered the other ingredients.

The ambiance is about what you'd expect for Coventry:  the walls are littered with announcements of local events and random posters, giving the place an eclectic feel.  There aren't many tables, so you're probably better off ordering take-out or delivery.  Service was fairly quick."}
{"text":"I've been to several Daves and this one is totally cool. A bit edgier, fresher updated appearance, and I love the space.  

I was greeted the minute I walked in the door and I could sense the staffs enthusiasm. They were helpful, allowed me to make some substitutions as I wanted hot peppers instead of banana and they actually have beer. A turkey Dave and a beer on this hot of a day totally hit the spot. 

This location is bigger and we were able to sit and relax. Learned they also deliver which I will keep in mind. Definitely will return now that I know where this is in Solon."}
{"text":"Love Dave's   Don't love that 50% of the time they put shredded cheese on when I ask for no cheese.  I'll keep trying tho"}
{"text":"I have been going here every 3 weeks for several years and the food has been really consistant, the service quick, but the price has steadily increased and for some odd reason, the last few times I've ordered, the pickle has either been non existant or it's lookinb pretty wilted. HIghly recommend the crazy dave if you like a little heat in your lunch."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place has so many bad reviews.  I finally went here for the first time last week because a few of my friends kept telling me I needed to try it out.  Glad I did!  I love a good sandwich, especially hot ones, so I ordered the Dave's club.  It had turkey, ham, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, Swiss cheese, mayo and Dave's Cosmic Sauce served hot.  Wow Dave's Cosmic Sauce is awesome!  Next time I go I'm definitely going to order my sandwich with extra sauce and buy a bottle to bring home!  I wish I knew what the sauce was because it's so good, all I know is that it's vegan and delish!  I also loved the hot crusty bread they use for the sandwiches.  It held together nicely and soaked up all my yummy cosmic sauce :) My better half ordered the Dave's peace steak which had steak, mayo, green pepper, tomato, crispy onion, mushrooms, Dave's Cosmic Sauce, and provolone cheese served hot.  I tried a bite and thought his was good too.  He wasn't as big of a fan of the Dave's sauce like I was, so he said next time he would order it on the side.  SMH what does he know anyways?  Lol.  
Can't wait to come back and try one of the Italian sandwiches.  I think that Dave's Cosmic sauce would pair perfectly with Italian meats :D"}
{"text":"This is the home of the mediocre sub.  People like it in town because it is somewhat eclectic with the psychedelic paint job and rock memorabilia.  For the price, you're really getting ripped off.  Let's take a closer look.

First, Dave himself is a complete jerk.  He loves himself more than just about anybody I have ever met.  Check out their website if you don't believe me- it's all about him.  If he is working in the shop, you should just turn around and go somewhere else.  He once got into an argument with me over whether I ordered unsalted or salted chips for my take out order.  He actually started yelling at me about it- then when he read the order and it said SALTED chips, he started to scream (and I mean scream) at his staff.  Get a life, Dave.

The bread these subs are made on is ridiculous, in a bad way.  It's got good flavor, but you will regret it later when your mouth is torn to shreds.  The ingredients used to be top notch, but it seems as though Dave has moved to some less expensive stuff these days.    Alesci's in Solon has better sub sauce than Dave's Cosmic Sauce- so does Grum's (even the crappy one one miles road.)  

All-in-all, for the money there are a lot of other places you can go in town and get a good sandwich.  No need to burn your hard earned cash by giving it to an a-wad like Dave."}
{"text":"The worst meatball sub I have ever eaten. It was very greasy the only tasted it had was salt. Never had a meatball sub that had Italian dress on it. I will never order  from here again not good."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to get subs. Seating is a little limited on busy days, but the atmosphere is great and the staff is helpful and friendly. I'm from Mentor, but moved away, and make sure to stop in every time I'm in town. And even with months in between visits, they remember me and my order. Buy their sauce and great, unique pickles to go, but nothing beats the fresh-from-the-grill sandwiches."}
{"text":"Finally DTW has food available until late downtown after the bars have closed- the wait was long but their special sauce is delicious. Lots of different options."}
{"text":"I came in today for the first time, and got the steak sub which was fantastic.  Later on I realized the credit card machine had accidentally overcharged me so I had to call, I was extremely impressed with how quickly they resolved the issue, and how polite, sincere, and apologetic the man I spoke with was, Addison I think was his name.  Anyways, I would definitely go back, the food was fast delicious and they know how to quickly and efficiently solve problems.  Kudos to them for sure :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a reuben,  they messed it up, didnt apologize,  and called me petty. Linda the manager, she is also the owners wife hung up on me twice and told me if i wanted to call their corp office i could find the number myself. I WILL NEVER BUY FOOD FROM THEM AGAIN. THEY DONT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS i will post the video so u  can see for yourselves"}
{"text":"Love this location. This is probably the best cosmic Dave's in the area, in terms of service and quality of subs. My favorite is \"Crazy Dave's\" because I love the quantity and quality of salami and the nice blend of hot peppers. Although a bit oily at times, it's well worth it for taste. There aren't many tables unfortunately for such a small, popular place, but the atmosphere is terrific (a happy, hippy vibe)."}
{"text":"Usually I love Dave's for the hippy vibe and delicious peppers, but my favorite location for Dave's is in Hudson where the owner typically is on the weekends.  This location is much more convenient for me, though, so I decided to come to Solon instead.  The service was just ok here (not even considering they didn't take a Dave's coupon..) and the vibe is more corporate (which makes sense for Solon, I guess).  Mainly, I was disappointed because they don't put as much meat in the sandwich, leaving the bread even soggier than usual.  I'd compare Dave's to Potbelly's; the sauce is a bit more unique though, so it may be a hit or miss with some, and instead of a sandwich, you get a sub.  My favorite sub here is called \"Crazy Dave's\" that reminds me of \"The Wreck\" @ Potbelly's."}
{"text":"Amazing subs and a great staff. The far out chicken could be my favorite sub of all time, but they're all great. I appreciate the staff's willingness to suggest different things- I've never been steered wrong."}
{"text":"Awful. Waited literally 30 min for a sandwich. Never again. Staff was incredibly unconcerned with the dozen people waiting."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood place and I'm so glad that they're opening more up in nearby areas. 

First of all the atmosphere inside is like no other. It's like a blast from the past, straight out of the seventies!  Hippie inspired graffiti covers the walls, tributes to great musicians can also be seen hanging inside, and even their name really invokes the era. Such a fun place to eat inside of if you have the time and the staff are always really friendly and helpful if you have any questions!

Their subs live up to their name and truly are out of this world!  Their selection offers something for everyone, even if you're vegan or vegetarian. My personal favorite is the classic Dave and it really is the perfect classic sun. 

The absolute must try however is the Dave's sauce/dressing which comes automatically on a lot of their sandwiches and is pretty much a great addition to anything! So delicious!  You can even buy bottles to take home with you if you want to recreate your own subs at home!"}
{"text":"My husband raves about this place but being a long term hoagie lover, (like my absolute favorite food) I'm not totally head over heels. The special sauce tastes like pasta salad dressing; it's pretty sweet stuff. The lettuce is also under the meat.. It's not bad in any way. They're pretty tasty sandwiches and the bread is pretty good but this is not what I classify as a \"hoagie\".. so if you're looking for an old fashioned hoagie like I have been, this isn't it. This is for apalate that's a lot more fancy. I have yet to find an amazing, old fashioned, hoagie in Ohio period.  #nogoodhoagiesinohio"}
{"text":"I like the fact that they have a good amount of vegetarian options. It's usually pretty easy to find something that I can eat at a sub shop. Dave's is much better than the normal Subway/Jimmy John's routine. I love their Garden burger sandwich, and have gotten it ever single time. However, the burger itself seems to be coated in a thick layer of spices. I'm glad that they flavor the burger, but it gets to the point where all you can taste is the spice and nothing else. The same spice blend is in the mayo, which they put way too much of on the burger. The bread itself is a little too crusty and hard for my tastes, but its pretty good."}
{"text":"I venture this place a few times a month. The quality is always the same, very good 


I have yet to find a sandwich I didn't enjoy. 

My only gripe is you need to check your sandwich before you leave. Past few times they've messed up my order."}
{"text":"Thee best sub ever!!!!  I love the sauce they use ... ask for light because a little goes a long way.  ... definitely not a place to take a date because the garlic and onion in this sauce will  repel most vampires!
I get the # 10 vege ... perfect toast on the bun ... yum!  Owner run with great throw back decor and music!  A perfect place for a period guy like myself."}
{"text":"There is nothing yummier than a sub from Dave's all slathered up with Dave's cosmic sauce. It has a great hit of spice that leaves your mouth tingling. I got the Dave's all American and the grateful Dave's. They're both awesome!! The touch of smooth avocado with the spice of the sauce just feels so right!

The sub shop is very cool and pays homage to many of rock's legends. There is writing all over the walls and pictures and ads. It'll definitely leave you entertained while you're waiting for your sub.

This is a great place for a late night snack or a quick bite for dinner. Make sure you eat it when you get it, because the great sourdough bread will get soggy under the sauce."}
{"text":"Ambiance: 4. Dave's is a 60s-themed sub-shop and a nice change from plain-vanilla peers like Subway, Penn Station, etc. Appreciated vintage posters, murals, etc.

Cost: 3. Pretty standard versus other premium-sub shop locations.  Won't be quite as cheap as a Subway, but you get what you pay for.

Food Quality: 3. A lot of solid menu choices, bread is fresh, and the signature Italian dressing sauce is smothered over practically all of them unless you say otherwise.  Only gripes with Dave's - 1) the bread is stuffed so quickly/full sometimes that cheese etc falls out almost immediately, 2) what you'd expect when you see a \"pickle\" included in your meal is really a \"cucumber\", nowhere near the brine you'd expect. I therefore recommend hot subs over cold as to keep ingredients together.

Service: 5. Have had friendly and fast experiences 100% of the time I've visited this location.

When to return: Lunch, solid sandwich option. When you can't handle Subway anymore. To get your daily dose of classic rock.

Pro tip: If you're all about the Italian dressing it's now sold at local Cleveland grocery stores."}
{"text":"Have you ever found the perfect sub?  One that hits every single flavor your heart desires, and somehow both fills you up and makes you hunger for more?

That's the Crazy Dave.  Add some chips and a Peace Tea, and I'm in heaven.  

I used to work in Great Lakes Mall, and co-ordinated a couple deliveries to my kiosk and the surrounding businesses.  Doing so made everyone's day, and the Dave's staff took the little extra running around in stride.  They're the kind of people who you can tell love their job.

The corned beef is really good, too."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Reminds me of deli's I use to go to in college when I lived in California.  I have moved around the Midwest and  have been in searching for a sandwich that compares to those.   Cosmic Dave's has been the best I have found! They have so many options you cant go wrong. Also that Dave's sauce is incredible."}
{"text":"This place is stupid good. It's the Original Dave's and it's right by the Falls making it a staple if you're in the area. My sub is literally ready by the time I'm done paying (unless it's ridiculously busy) & it's the best sub I've ever had every time. The Dave's Cosmic Sauce is so fire too. Must have."}
{"text":"Love this place , the people and the food are great . Best sub shop in Akron , I heard they deliver now"}
{"text":"Went there again this year and it was just as good as last year.  Same great small town and same great subs.  Again, it's not Laspada's, but its solid good eats."}
{"text":"There is a bald man who guards the 15 min parking spot who works there! Very awkward, I did not feel safe. He stared and paced back and forth in and out of the store. I didn't mind moving, but this type of behavior leads me to believe this place is going down hill instead of their old hippy vibe. I will not be eating there."}
{"text":"This place constantly delivers a solid experience of great food, incredibly friendly staff and choices that you can't be bored with. 

The Far Out Chicken (with a side of Blue Cheese) is something I crave like an addict...there is no explaining it as its a basic concept however the delivery with crusty bread and hot oil - banging!  Add a bag of Jalapeño Heat Diirty Kettle Chips if u aren't a wuss. 

Please be considerate as the dining area is small - don't take a 4 top for just you - sit near the drink cooler.  And remember to tip the folks that made ur food & did it just the way you like"}
{"text":"These subs are amazing. The menu is a mile long, so there's something for everyone, and you cannot beat their bread. They also just started serving fresh-cut fries...amazing. The sandwiches are huge and kind of messy (stock up on napkins), but so, so good. 

They have a few tables inside (check out the decor when you stop in - it's definitely on theme), but if you don't want to eat indoors, there's plenty of public outdoor seating a block away in Acorn Alley.

P.S. They totally won my heart when they offered a bowl of water for my dog waiting outside :)"}
{"text":"Dave's is awesome. I grew up eating here in high school, then college, and I now take Dave's sauce back out to Denver with me every time I come home. Eat at Dave's, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"That'll teach me to order lobster bisque at a sub place. 

I was in town this past weekend for a variety of engagements, and wanted to get the superb lobster corn chowder at Lemon Falls. Unfortunately I arrived in town late--a few minutes after 6pm. Lemon Falls closed at 6pm on Saturday. So sucks to be me, but to get some food prior to attending a Norwex party was my objective, so onward soldiering for the chow went me. And cheap. I should add that I was seeking inexpensive food that fateful night. Well, cheap for Chagrin Falls anyway. So to Dave's Subs I went. I usually get the Haight-Ashbury. But something caught my attention Saturday night--a \"lobster bisque\" advert on the back board. My goodness--lobster bisque at a sub place? Sacre bleu! I figured I'd ask for a slurp to verify its decency before investing. Alas though, I was told no samples. I asked where the bisque was procured. Sorry we can't tell you. All we can say is someone makes it for us. Hmmm. Who could this elusive someone be? 

It was past six and I wanted to eat and run, so I figured, heck Michelle, let's give it a shot. 

I wasn't impressed. The bisque was okay certainly. But also certainly nothing to write home about. Won't make this mistake again. Next time I'm at Dave's, it's back to one of the classics that this place does so well."}
{"text":"Just moved to Lakewood and Dave's was highly recommended. Tried the Crazy Dave. It was super spicy, and super delicious."}
{"text":"It's Friday night. Go wild or rest up? 

Compromise and share a lazy night in with crazy Daze!

We watched funny stuff and ate:

THE CRAZY DAVE
Prosciutto, Capicola, Hot Peppers, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions, Fresh Garlic, Provolone Cheese, then Sprinkled With Crushed Red Peppers, Herbs, and Dave's Cosmic Sauce.

DAVE'S FAMOUS ITALIAN SAUSAGE 
Top Grade Italian Sausage, Dave's Cosmic Sauce, Dave's Famous Marinara Sauce, topped with Provolone Cheese and a Dash of Romano Cheese, then Sprinkled with Herbs and Crushed Red Peppers. Served Hot.

The Maui Onion \"DIRTY\" brand chips and the original sea salted ones.  

Crazy good. Exactly what a homegrown sub shop taste experience should be!!! Apparently there are a few locations throughout Ohio and in other states as well. I'm not surprised and am definitely a new fangirl."}
{"text":"I had a chance to eat at this place a while back and the menu offers a staggering amount of choices.  I ended up trying several different items over the course of a couple of weeks in the area and I can say that this place is definitely a great sub place.  They offer a really really good Italian sub.  The couple of times I was here the staff wasn't all that friendly but they weren't rude either.  The place is decorated like a hippies paradise which makes dining there very interesting and unique.  

To really appreciate this place you should not only read the reviews but also look at the pictures of the subs themselves as they show just how great (and unique) the food here really is.  If I lived in this area I'd have this place at least once a month for lunch no doubt."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Wonderful.  Great.  Priced right.  Good food.  Thoroughly enjoy."}
{"text":"Not nearly as good as the original one in Chagrin Falls. This franchise location severely cut down the size of the sandwiches compared to the original and the sauce isn't even the same or as flavorful. My family was pretty disappointed in our sandwiches as we eat at the original one quite a bit and expected the same at this location."}
{"text":"A tip to Dave: Double check your delivery orders before they get sent out. Lunch for seven of us involved three trips from the delivery man as drinks were incorrect, desserts were forgotten, and one poor girl (not me!) had her lunch omitted entirely. 

I went with the Summer Breeze Salad - a mixture of romaine, chicken, oranges, apples, cranberries, and walnuts - bleu cheese vinaigrette on the side. It was quite good and just the perfect size for lunch. The chicken was fresh and shredded, the vinaigrette perfectly tasty. I'd definitely order it again if I lived in the area. 

However, I seemed to fare better than those who ordered sandwiches (which, I would like to point out, was everyone else, so congrats to me for my psychic lunch-picking abilities). Most appeared to be 80% shredded iceberg lettuce. One girl stuck hers in the microwave in an effort to zest it up a bit (Yeah, odd, I know. As I said, I got a salad). 

The final nail-in-the-coffin for the sandwich-eaters was that most of them ordered the Ooey Gooey Brownie for dessert. Apparently it was neither ooey nor gooey. Alas."}
{"text":"For me a sub sandwich is all about the bread, and Dave's Cosmic Sub must have been out back lighting one up and missed that point.

I've given this location 3 tries now, and each time the bread seemed to be stale/borderline hard.  I mean I understand having a nice crust and all, but my mouth shouldn't feel like I was trying to chew on sharp rocks!

I suppose they have some decent choices for types of subs, and I do like their own branded sodas.  That's why they got 2 stars.

Also be warned that when they say that they slather their subs in the special sauce they REALLY mean it!  It was close to the Gulf Oil Spill with the amount they put on there.  Maybe the the over abundance of oil is there to help soften the bread.  

Oh, and I don't know what type of onions they use, but expect to have that onion smell linger on you for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Family friendly, quick service, good food whether your vegetarian or an omnivore... this was my first time here and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best sub ive ever had.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The bread is fresh and I'm a fan of the Turkey Dave...The sauce is also very flavorful and they sell it by the bottle. Sometimes it takes a bit of time to receive your order, however, and parking can be problematic. I live in Avon and wish they had one closer here."}
{"text":"I've been to this location about  3 or 4 times and I keep saying to myself \"Why are going back, this place always sucks\"   Well, It does and Ive learned my lesson and will never go back.  I think the bread sucks, kinda tough or stale, very overpriced, and they skimp on the meat.  

I hate to say it, but I think subway is better."}
{"text":"Well this IS a good sub. What's not good is watching a manager pick on an employee. Mr. Manager, if you've been doing this 14 years, as you sneer at your cashier, than you should know that if you're going to be rude to your employees, you should take it in the back. 

Your attitude cost you 1 star.

And by the way, I have 15 years in foodservice. You were probably a cashier once too."}
{"text":"If there were ever a Mexican Standoff including Subway, Quizno's, and Dave's Cosmic Subs where each subs shop had to stare down the other sub shops, and hope he guesses correctly on which one to shoot first, Dave's would win.  Likely because Subway and Quizno's do not see Dave's as competition.
If, however, it was Subway AND Quizno's against Dave's, Dave's would still win.  This is because they have not only the rockin-est, but also the tastiest subs around.  And to this San Francisco ex-pat, the decor makes me feel like I'm home.

The bread, I think, is what really makes these subs killer.  Every bite is tasty from bite to chew to swallow.  The subs are really large, however, and a large can easily feed three people.  The smaller size might not quite serve two, but if you're not starving, it certainly can.

This location features a nice patio for those two months when you can sit outside in Cleveland.  Try not to stuff yourself, Ben & Jerry's is nearby."}
{"text":"What a nice place!

I came here for lunch while I was working at a nearby school. The store front was bright and I loved the decorations and music playing.

I ordered the # 5 and was very pleased with my sandwich. The bread was great and everything tasted fresh and complimented each other very nicely.

The lady behind was counter was very friendly and even greeted whom I assume was a regular with \"Hey Handsome!\"

If I'm ever in the area I will be sure to try this place again."}
{"text":"Eh, we ended up here on a fluke. I heard great things about this place, even saw it was voted #1 best subs in Cleveland, I beg to differ.

First the inside is small, which is fine it's a quick bite sandwich shop that has been left stuck in the 60's with groovy themes. 

Second, the menu has a limited variety of meat choices, chicken, turkey, ham, roast beef and tuna, veggie. That's it. I was hoping they would have a cheesesteak option but to no avail. 
I decided to have the far out chicken Dave; it was good size, only $6.99, with cheese and chicken and the usual sandwich toppings. We ate outside as it was a gorgeous spring evening. 

My sandwich was a giant batch of grease on a sub roll. I really couldn't even enjoy it because my bread soaked through and the sandwich fell apart, what I did taste is an over abundance of oregano, too much hot sauce and the cheese completely masked what would have been the taste of the sliced chicken. I was truly disappointed. I've had better subs from Get-Go which is saying a lot right? I'll try again but not this location as the girl behind the counter had a nose ring to go along with her attitude. Not for me."}
{"text":"There are several sub shops nearby, but this place is my favorite!  The meatball sub is messy, but is very satisfying on these cool fall days."}
{"text":"Great sub spot for Ohio and is different from all the rest.  Their original Daves and meatball are my favorite but so many other great options!"}
{"text":"Dirty tables, trash can that looked like it hadn't been emptied in weeks, hard chewy bread, tasteless sub loaded with lettuce like Subway.  Venture over to Franklin Square Deli if you want a decent reasonably priced sub and skip this place all together."}
{"text":"I love subs... and Dave's Cosmic Subs are definitely in the Top 5 all time, maybe Top 3 on a good day.   Get the Cosmic Sauce on it for sure."}
{"text":"The homemade garlic sauce is pretty good...l love garlic. Also the vanilla cream soda was great. It's everything else that was mediocre. Don't get ur subs toasted if u don't like tooth breaking bread...the way the subs are assembled make them hard to get a taste for everything on it in one bite. The chili dog is terrible for 5.79...what chili you might observe. 11.50 for a sub is ridiculous for what you actually receive. For that price maybe the fries should come with it. The bacon sub was a huge disappointment, but if you like the precooked microwave bacon then you'll love it. Again definitely not worth 11.50.

 Two words for two stars. Overpriced and Overrated."}
{"text":"Wow what a place! I normally don't get excited over sub places, and there are the run of the mill places you can find in any mall with nothing special food such as you get at the large chains. I have come to expect that from sub shops.

 Prior to going to Dave's my favorite sub place in Cleveland was Grums. When I get back to the Cleveland area if I am going to a sub place I usually go to Grums. Both Dave's and Grums are great however there is no seating in Grums and the location is on Coventry.

 I was in Chagrin falls and wanted a quick inexpensive lunch so I went into Dave's Cosmic Subs.  When you walk in the decor takes you back to the 60's with rock posters everywhere. However that's not why you go there, you go there for the food and I can honestly say it was outstanding.

 The bread is what makes their subs special and they make their own daily. You also will find sandwiches you won't find on any other menu. I am a vegetarian and there were quite a few selections. Their customer service is outstanding! The people at the counter were friendly and would give you suggestions if you needed it.  Next time I am back in the Cleveland area I definitely will be back"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite sub shop!  I think what I love most about Dave's is that no matter how many times I go in here (and no matter which location), I'm not disappointed.  Even though it's a local chain, each place manages to get the consistency correct.  And the subs always taste fresh.  I've never had a sub from here that made me wonder how long the lettuce had been sitting out, how early the tomatoes had been picked prior to ripeness or how long the bread had been starting to harden.  It's always great here.  Glad to have this place around."}
{"text":"Tasty sub at a reasonable price! Went to the Dave's Cosmic Subs up at Crocker Park for lunch this afternoon and had the original sub. Placed my order and was served quickly considered the amount of people waiting for their orders.

First off I'll state for the record that I'm a fan of the bread at Dave's, fresh and a nice crisp crust. The meats, cheeses and add on like hot pepper rings are all tasty and well portioned for the size of the sandwich. The sub sauce is the 'secret sauce' that brings the sandwich together. Added a bottled ginger ale and bag of chips for less than $10.

The Westlake Dave's is sandwiched in a small storefront looking across to Trader Joe's. Parking is basically in the garages, very limited on the street metered spot available. The decor is old album and rock concert posters, fits the theme but not overly exciting. 

With a lot of competition from other chains like Jersey Mike's, Penn Station and Dibello's Daves Cosmic Subs holds its own in quality, taste and value for the money."}
{"text":"Warning: These subs are highly addictive. I'm drooling just thinking about them."}
{"text":"I love Dave's. I have a long history of loving subs and Dave's doesn't disappoint. The Turkey Dave. No rubber, watery turkey lunch meat. Always fantastic & fresh, their special sauce is amazing. I only eat tuna at Dave's. The Dave's Tuna is spiced & mayo'd just right. I crave Dave's & usually get a party tray during the year for parties. Love the pickles. I've been eating Dave's since they opened downtown & the Lakewood location is greater for weekend dinners to pick up for movie nights."}
{"text":"Ok, nothing too crazy delicious. I had the Dave's Original sub, not the best but decent."}
{"text":"This location makes sandwiches super fast and never sacrifices quality.  I love Dave's subs!  Granted they're a little pricier than Subway but I think you're getting way more quality and a bigger sandwich.  My favs are the Turkey Dave and Far Out Chicken.  Great sandwiches.  Keep up the good work, Dave!"}
{"text":"Isn't it fun to try new and different places?  How many really unique stories are there that helps one establishment stand out from the next?  What compels you to jump into the pool with both feet?

It was well after lunch when we stopped by and the place was empty.  The guys at the counter gave us a friendly greeting and a moment to look over the expansive menu.  Lots of sub choices other goodies.  I went with the Original Dave's Cosmic Sub

The large sandwich was actually two smaller sammys combined.  I would have liked to take a pic with an uberwich.  The Italian loaf was a fresh combination of flaky crust and soft, chewy bread.  The sliced meats were delectable and savory, which was complimented well by the fresh veggies.  I especially liked the mild bite and crunch from the banana peppers.

And the dressing aka Dave's Cosmic Sauce? Kinda reminded me of Italian salad dressing, but not too oily. Oh, yeah, I like-a da sauce.

A couple of casual observations:  Cool 60's nostalgic vibe & decor.  Loud music.  Customers are welcome to add their doodling and graffiti on the walls.  Scribbled out b0ner?  Yup."}
{"text":"Dave's Cosmos, man, the place is definitely unique. Get the Incredible Dave, it's to die for and the top secret Dave's cosmic sauce is utterly delicious. Worth a trip to stop by!"}
{"text":"Currently waiting on my food and I'm writing my review while in the shop because that's how bad the customer service was. Amazing food, my favorite sub shop, but the girl at the register needs a customer service lesson. I said please and thank you, was very kind, and she just looked blankly at me and said nothing. I'm in both customer service and the service industry and I'm appalled. She made me feel incredibly uncomfortable, and that's not cool if you're gonna be dealing with the public. You don't have to kiss my ass, but at least be nice and polite?"}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop with tons of options to choose from and you can customize them further. Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Staying in Kent for the night.  Needed sandwiches to go.  Dave's Cosmic Subs was delicious.  Got The Grateful Dave.  Turkey, tomato, red onion, Dave's Cosmic Sauce, avocado, alfalfa sprouts, mayo and hot pepper juice. UNBELIEVABLY good.  Add provolone, have them toast it up so the cheese gets melty.  Have them add the sprouts after toasting so they don't get soggy.  Trust me, mouth-gasm. Was concerned it would be too spicy. Not at all.  The hot pepper juice is a drizzle and adds the perfect dab of flavorful kick.  We ended up eating there because we had melty toasty goodness.  Intended on saving half for later...no chance.  The collection of music memorabilia is pretty excellent too. GO!"}
{"text":"I came here for a sub sandwich on a weekday night and got a pizza sub. Given the fact that we weren't in the store for too long, it's hard to say too much about it, but the staff were pleasant and helpful and took my customizations without any chagrin. My partner ordered a sub as well, and the process was similar.

The food itself was delicious, and the bread was well toasted and crispy. My sub was pretty simple, but got the job done.

My only complaint was that it seemed to take about 15-20 minutes to make two subs despite the fact that we were literally the only ones in the store. I suppose it's possible that the employees had just received a ginormous phone order, but they didn't seem particularly busy, so I don't assume that's the case.

We'll probably come back here again."}
{"text":"I really like the sub (Big Dave) but I do wish that when you ask for them hot they were hotter. It was more like lukewarm.

Edit: the last couple of times I've been back the sandwich was heated perfectly :)"}
{"text":"My grandson and I rode our bikes into town for a treat at Dave's. It did not disappoint.
My sub #13, turkey, provolone, tomato, lettuce, banana peppers and Dave's Cosmic Sauce was fresh, the bread was crusty outside and soft inside and all in all the sub was very tasty. The service was quick and polite. If you want a great sun in the Chagrin area, Dave's is the place to go."}
{"text":"I'm not from here, but my coworker recommended this little spot. He said it was the best he's ever had, so of course I had to give it a try...I am so happy so did. The employee behind the counter was so sweet and so helpful. He knew the menu items and how to recommend. I ordered the Pastrami #7, and oh wow! So delicious! Give this hidden gem a try. Worth it."}
{"text":"Bummer. Was hoping to try this place out but they won't deliver to the holiday Inn as it is right outside their delivery area. 2.4 miles. Was told I could call the other location but they don't answer their phone. Reviews are great and hope to try their subs someday."}
{"text":"Yesterday my husband, daughter, and I went for a Sunday lunch around 2 pm. We walked in and there was 2 ladies in front of us ordering and then we were next in line. As we were ordering, a man came back in to the counter because he take out always wrong. The lady at the register did not seem to care and started to take my order again. All I had were two subs to order, chips, and drinks... However the lady was not friendly and took her good old time to ring me out. (By the way, it appeared she must have had a rough night because she was not pleasant, and was wearing what looked like pajama pants and slippers. Very odd and not a good imagine for a business). We sat down and it took an eternity for 2 sandwiches to be made. Finally when our name was called (couldn't hardly hear her when she called out names because she made it know she was having a day she didn't want to work) we finally got to eat. The subs tasted fine. However for the time it took and lack of crowd, and also for the poor customer service I will not return to this location. Thankfully there are others in Northeast Ohio!"}
{"text":"This is a great local chain, lots of fun, good music and great sammiches. Staff is friendly, and the service is typically quick. You will need more than a couple trips to try from the large selection. Had the tuna today for the first time, it was great.  Only 5 tables with seating for four at each, so in busy times seats my be limited. Classic Rock blaring completed the Cosmic experience."}
{"text":"Great Sub.  Maybe the best ever.  Great crunchy Italian bread, super Italian dressing (Heavy on the Oregano).  The turkey was moist, but not loaded with water and banana peppers.  So excellant.  I saw some sucker eating a Subway the other day!  They dont know what they are missing."}
{"text":"It was my first time here. Best horseradish sauce ever! Definitely opened the  sinuses . Super friendly staff that has no problem helping you decide what you want."}
{"text":"I had Dave's for delivery for the first time during a business/working lunch. It was good, but coming from another city with notable subs, I was not completely awed. It was tasty and what you would want as a good deli sandwich, but is nothing especially unique. 

The delivery also took an hour. The delivery boy came on a bike. That might have had something to do with it."}
{"text":"Service is horrible here!!!!! Sad because their subs are pretty darn good."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favorite places in Mentor. Not only are the subs beyond tasty, but the owners really make customers feel welcome.

I've been a customer at Dave's for about 6 months and everyone who works there knows us when we come in - they even know what substitutions to make on our subs!

Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is very hippy, chill. Be sure to sign the wall if you eat there!"}
{"text":"Anytime I'm in Ohio I stop by for a Crazy Dave, its spicy and delicious, though I must say, i miss the old peppers on the sandwich"}
{"text":"Quick and great service!  Awesome subs, most recently tried the Far Out Chicken and was impressed."}
{"text":"Best meatball sandwich I've ever had. The combo of the 2 sauces was not what I expected, but in a great way"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and tried one of the chicken subs. Overall thought it was a fairly nice deal for the price; although definitely felt it could have used more overall...better bread, fresher tasting toppings, and more flavorful sauces. I also remember there was a lot of pepper for some reason."}
{"text":"Great Food and convenient location for many business people. It is not on the main thoroughfare so if you don't know about the place you'll go right past it. Great food and awesome staff. Real friendly and customer oriented. It is a repeat lunch destination."}
{"text":"Decided to try this out on the basis of the Yelp reviews. I have to say that I was underwhelmed.

I had heard that the menu was a little overwhelming and I was charged with picking up lunch for myself and the wife. I decided to look online first and get our order ready. I stepped up to the counter and ordered the subs by name and was immediately told that I needed to order by number. I hadn't even looked over at the menu board and was quickly trying to figure out the numbers corresponding to the descriptions I had in hand. I apologized for holding up the line by mentioning that the website did not have any numbers for sandwiches and the employee said, \"Yeah, they need to fix that.\"

The sandwiches were good but they were not worth the price. Sandwiches are meant to be a cheap food but you'll be lucky to get out of here with a drink and sandwich for under $10.

I can get surly service at any number of other places and for less money so I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Delicious subs!  Family road trip needed quick dinner and stopped in.  Had many of the subs and all were outstanding!  Had Dave's Original, a Reuben, a bruschetta...Can't wait to return soon."}
{"text":"So good. Stopped here on a road trip and was pleasantly surprised. The cure for the common subway. The guy was really nice too and took the time to explain their offerings and make a few recommendations since we were new customers.  Well worth the drive off the freeway and was a highlight of the trip."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The bread is delicious, the sauces are amazing and their pickles are out of this world! Their vegetarian baked potato soup is perfection. They have quite a few creative vegetarian options, which wins bonus points with me! So many sub shops only have one vegetarian sub and they're usually all the same, but not at Dave's! They have quite a few different vegetarian options and they're all very different."}
{"text":"This is one of our most favorite Delis to have a great Sub!! The Hot San Fran is so Yummy!! The employees are always friendly!  We totally recommend eating at Cosmic Dave's. You'll love the music too!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the Veggie Burger sub, it makes me giddy with joy! The staff is friendly and funny. The owner and delivery guy are pretty hot! Then again, I am a horn dog, but I digress. The subs are made fresh with fresh ingredients. The price is moderate, but the quality trumps the price. Also, they deliver until 4. Which, helps a lot because it is hard for me when I am work to go get the subs, because I don't have a lunch break. It is awesome! I would totally recommend this place to anyone, looking for a good sub. 

Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places when we lived in the neighborhood-- and they deliver on SkipTheDishes as well as UberEats, which makes it even better.

I'm a huge fan of the meatball sub: the meatballs are delicious, the sauce is flavorful and not at all pasty, and it has just the right amount of cheese.  I rarely branched out from the meatball, but remember that the chicken cordon bleu and a few of the turkey options are good as well.  Bread options are just white and wheat, but both are high quality, soft on the inside and crisp on the crust side.  Their fries are a little soggy for my liking but the coleslaw is delicious, and they offer a plethora of chips.  The price is right for the portion size.

This is an Ohio original Cleveland can be proud of."}
{"text":"WORST SUB EVER!   I purchased a \"Hey, Dave\".   Roast beef, swiss cheese, pepper rings and horseradish sauce.   It normally comes with slaw on the sandwich but I asked for it on the side.  That was fine.  But the sandwich was completely dry.   I finally located a teaspoon or less (my grandma used to call it a \"dab\") of horseradish sauce under the roast beef.  There was a grand total of ONE medium thin slice of roast beef (not the roasted kind, the lunchmeat kind) folded in half.  There were two paper-thin slices of swiss cheese.  The pepper rings were the only thing provided in the appropriate amount.  You know you're in trouble when Subways beats you for quality AND quantity.  They did offer me a refund when I returned the sandwich (or a free sub---but who wants a free crappy sub?). I'll never go there again."}
{"text":"One of the best sub places that I've ever found, their subs are really unique (in my experience at least). Great bread, great ingredients, and their 'secret sauce' (aka salad dressing) is wonderful. There are a ton of subs to choose from, but the names are all so absurd (The ______ Dave) that it can be quite difficult to figure out what to get. Hence, I almost always get the #1.

I've never had a bad service experience; coming back to town after being gone for a year, the woman who usually works the counter remembered my usual order without any prompting.

The hippie memorabilia is a little nauseating (where else can you see a family tree of The Choir?) but thats their thing; too bad Dave drives an Escalade.

Seating is very limited, but I have almost never encountered anyone else in the place."}
{"text":"My son and I like subs and we decided to stop in here for lunch.  They have a bunch of hot and cold pre-menu item subs that you can order by number but special ordering seems to slow the process down a tad bit.  
****************
There is a lot of \"memorabilia\" in there (think hard-rock cafe on a budget) and much is grateful dead/janis joplin related.   Wisely most of it does not appear to be original but copies of.  

I ordered a turkey dave, w/o banana peppers, hot and my son only wanted to have turkey, lettuce, black olives and cheese, cold.  We threw a monkey wrench into the works I fear.   As we waited...and waited....and waited...at the 15 minute mark we got an apology from the fellow making the sub that he was running a little behind...if so, how did the people who ordered after us get served, eat and leave before we were served?

My sub was unremarkable.  The bread was just a little crunchy...either stale or spent a little too much time getting heated up.  It was okay, but not a place where I'd cross three lanes of traffic to go to.  That coupled with a pretty pricey sub you aren't having lunch w/ a drink and chips for under $20.

Two stars for wait time and price, the sub was a solid 3+."}
{"text":"Awesome sauce and a meal for less than $10 are main selling points.

The bread's more like a baguette in texture compared to the fluffier white bread on a Subway or Quizznos. Some like the former, some like the latter. I prefer softer bread. Just know what you tend to like, nothing wrong either way. 

Here's the clincher: They have delicious, juicy, thinly-sliced corned beef on rye; served hot. They have hotdogs too. For me at least, these two added options on the menu alone make this the winner in the battle of the franchise sub-shops.

They also have bottled specialty sodas. Although the place looks like they might sell weed too, they don't."}
{"text":"I'm powerless against Dave's Original Sub! It is the yummiest and freshest-tasting sub on the block (I'm lookin' at you, Potbelly's!)."}
{"text":"Mediocre subs on white bread that are overly expensive.  I don't get why everyone likes it.  My 2 little boys wouldn't eat theirs, and Subway & Jimmy Johns are 2 of their favorite restaurants.

Might be good for people who care more about kitsch and ambiance, as opposed to good food, but I won't go back."}
{"text":"The Chagrin Falls shack is my favorite of the Dave's locations. The staff is hilarious and incredibly friendly, and the little place itself will have you discovering something new on the walls each time you go. The only downside is that often times the sauce is pretty overpowering, which tends to mask the flavor of the other ingredients. 

Pro tip: go for light sauce to make sure you get all the flavor!"}
{"text":"Dave's subs is always delicious. A small shop with some funky decorations. It's always empty when I go, and takes about 10 min to get my sandwich. Sometimes I just get a craving for the super dave corned beef sub, which has become my go-to! The bread is soft, even the whole wheat bread. All of their subs come with a pickle--don't forget to ask for it without the pickle if you're a pickle-hater because the juice can get on your sub! I've also had the meatball sub, which is delicious, but very messy to eat. You can also buy Dave's Cosmic Sauce by the bottle!

Overall, better subs than Jimmy Johns across the street, fast service, and lots of choices."}
{"text":"Cleveland dances to its own music which means do not expect here what you can find elsewhere. Subs are a perfect example. Most cities have a sandwich that may be called a hoagie, submarine, Italian hero, or po' boy. You can buy them all over and most are made quite well. They contain deli meats piled on good bread with onions, lettuce, and tomatoes. The lightest sprinkling of oil and vinegar dresses the sandwich. So simple, so pure, and so delicious. 

No where in Cleveland have I had a good sub. And worst of the attempts is Dave's Cosmic Subs. Bad bread, bad meats, bad sauce, and the most unsavory shredded cheese. The woman who made my sub was so darn nice I hated to have her see me toss it out after a few bites. Perhaps a food truck will specialize in making this simple sandwich if I am lucky."}
{"text":"Not only do they have horrible customer service. But when I made a phone call to them they hung up on me. I am a delivery driver and Dave is one of our clients. Every day that I go to except for the one on Lorraine in Ohio city has the food ready. When I go to this one they say three minutes! And 15 minutes later you're still standing. This is after they have 20 minutes to get the Food ready before you get there. I called them to inform them the drivers don't get paid for wait time they make 3 to 4 maybe five dollars to deliver the food and he hung up on me. Horrible horrible horrible."}
{"text":"It was a great big sub with all kinds of delish food all over it. It had stuff I wouldn't normally put on a sub and it turned our great! It reminds me of a Jimmy John's but with a spastic ADD chef. Jimmy John's is simple and clean while Dave's coevers the sub with crazy goods! The menu and atmosphere are fun and different and worthy of 4 stars!"}
{"text":"So so so so good! I loved trying Dave's Philly cheesesteak. It's a bit different than a traditional cheesesteak but honestly, it's great! 

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Dave's rocks.  If you are looking for a cheap sub, with bottom-dollar meats and poofy bread, stay at Subway.

Dave's uses a crispy-crust loaf, similar to traditional New Orleans Po-boy bread.  You won't cut your gums on the crust (like you might on the best Italian bread), but it's crisp.

The meats, cheeses, etc. are all quality stuff.  Good dressings.

If they would just make a banh mi, I'd never go anywhere else for a sammich.

You will spend a couple of bucks more here than you would at Subway.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"Great stuff.  Crispy hoagie roll/baguette bread, quality ingredients.  This is the anti-subway.

I enjoyed my \"peace steak\", a daily special.  An overly large chunk of raw green pepper was the only thing keeping this from perfection."}
{"text":"Decent subs, cheap prices but I ordered iced tea, asked for sweet & low or some substitute, got a terse \"We don't carry any of that.\"

Don't carry it?
Why exactly?
A box of that costs what, 4 dollars at a supermarket?
Probably much less wholesale?

Goodbye Dave's."}
{"text":"Dave's is always delicious. The staff at this location are so nice! I recommend the Veg-out. It's fantastic both hot and cold! I'm a vegetarian so I haven't tried very many sandwiches but my friends all love the Turkey Dave. Go here... you won't regret it! Take home some sauce and a cosmic brownie:)"}
{"text":"Dave, if you are reading this, you. are. a. GOD.

I ordered a Hey Dave. It was a small sandwich. I wasn't sure if it was worth the $6.50 (I went there a month ago, so I might be wrong about the price) when I bought it. Then I took a bite into it, and my mouth died and went to heaven. This might be the best sammy ever. Or at least, the best I've ever tried.

The interior feels like you walked right into a Asbury-Height restaurant. Dollar bills everywhere on the ceiling. The wall is plastered with posters of bands that smoked waaaaay too much weed. Felt like a place that is stuck in the 1970s. Love the atmosphere.

It's kinda far from my house, but it's well worth the drive. I definitely plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Nice little cosmic hippie place to grab a sub.  If your looking for rainbows, tie-die and a sub than this is your place.  If you want a ride on the peace train, follow the signs.  

My sandwich was good.  6.5/10
The soda machine was flat. 
Customer service was very good
Fresh cut fries were limp.  Wouldn't order again.  
But I would go back for a sandwich.  

Cheers."}
{"text":"I've been working downtown for months now and have only recently discovered Dave's and my life has forever changed. They have, hands down, some of the best subs around. Their options are plentiful and have about every combination of different meats that you can imagine. The Turkey Dave is my favorite; I think the banana peppers and the special sauce that they put on it definitely make it. I've also had the Original Dave's Sub, which is their signature sandwich. It has a heaping portion of salami, peperoni and prosciutto, among other things. The shop is small, but consistently packed at lunch on weekdays. There are only a few tables to sit at, so it's best when taken to eat on the go."}
{"text":"Their menu says they deliver Monday-Saturday 11:00 am - 6:00 pm.  However, 95% of the time they say they're not delivering.  Hopefully, management will straighten this out as it can be construed as false advertisement. Other than this problem the staff are quite friendly."}
{"text":"Update again: The current staff here are great. Started going again regularly, and it's back to the quality it was when it first opened.

Definitely recommend.

Update: Changing my rating. The particular manager who was very rude to me no longer works there, so I was willing to give it another try.

Everything seems back to normal. Consistent, good quality. No wrong orders (yet).

Their food is good, they have a couple of good vegetarian options, I really like the fries, I recommend the #6.

Old review left below:

My order was wrong. When I called to explain this and ask them not for a refund but simply to replace the order, the woman who identified herself as the manager told me that \"sometimes that just happens,\" and they \"were very busy,\" and rather than apologizing or offering any kind of solution, immediately became rude. I've met the owner of this location on several occasions. I asked to speak to him or get his number, and she told me I she would not give it out because she would get in trouble. She eventually hung up on me

They had a previous store manager who recently left, and apparently their new manager has no idea how to deal with customers. I've been a regular here, the previous manager knew me by name and knew my and my girlfriend's order when I walked in.

I'll never be going back, or at least not until they have a change in management."}
{"text":"Fantabulous subs. Love Dave's there subs are great, good deli meat, and the bread i think makes the sub. They also have dave's cosmic sauce that goes on most subs which is the bee's knees. The dining area is very fun decorative with morels and  always good music playing."}
{"text":"The people working there were really cool, the subs unfortunately were not cosmic or out of this world."}
{"text":"I ate at this Cosmic Dave's Subs today.  It was super clean and the staff was helpful and very responsive.  It was my first time so when she saw me staring at the menu like a deer in headlights, she quickly handed me a to-go menu to cut down on the overwhelm.

I chose a meatball sub, something I rarely order since they can not hold up to my memories of the great Italian restaurants in my hometown,  It met and surpassed every expectation. I was so pleased by the toasty, meaty cheese deliciousness that I did not eat my chips ( and I love chips).

I would recommend Cosmic Dave's to everyone.  I am already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  I had a roast beef sub with yummy horseradish sauce.  My wife really enjoyed hers as well (the #2, I cant remember what it was called).  

Plus the Dude behind the counter was super nice and personable.  And I got to tell my LA-raised 7 year old about the James Gang..."}
{"text":"I've always seen this place around Cleveland and put off trying it. I don't really know why. 

The menu has a lot of options, so you'll probably find something to your liking. 

I had the meatball sub. Which included some really great tasting meatballs along with a good sauce and good amount of cheese. The bread is delicious. I saw some people on here complain that it's hard and/or stale. It is a crispy bread. But it's certainly not stale. I think it's a great touch to sandwiches with already good ingredients. 

I'd definitely go again and would recommend."}
{"text":"I've had Dave's subs twice and they are pretty good. I had two of the veggie subs with whole wheat rolls. They have enough cheese for protein but otherwise have lots of veggies. One of the sandwiches was hot and the other cold, a choice you make when you order. Hot's a lot better.

Dave's is going against the trend of letting people pick all their ingredients. At Dave's you can't substitute items although you can add them. It's good for people like me who don't want to think through all of the ingredients, but if there is something on the sandwich you don't like you'll have to take it out yourself or just eat through it.

Aside from the subs, the angle is the 60's rock music, with lots of memorabilia on the wall. Fun to look over and reminisce (or imagine)."}
{"text":"We tried this place for a quick dinner and had a great experience.  I tried a warm Turkey Dave in a lettuce wrap and it was so yummy.  The pickles aren't exactly dill, so heads up.  Still tasty.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Dave's is a local chain and recently added this location to Solon and a fairly crowded lunch restaurant scene. Wide variety of sandwiches and sauces and some interesting combinations. Service was fast and friendly.

My sandwich was excellent, piled high with meat and cheese and Cosmic sauce. It was served hot on crusty bread. The crusty bread is necessary to stand up to the juicy filling and sauce without falling apart, however it is a supremely messy sandwich to eat (not the kind of thing you should take back to your desk) but it was well worth it.

Interesting variety of sodas and chips. Try the funky fusion, it's like every kind of chip flavor in one."}
{"text":"My favorite sub place. Every sub is unique and has a gourmet touch. The tuna Dave is the best tuna I have had from a sub shoppe. They care about the details and it is evident in the great taste."}
{"text":"My first time here at Dave's. Mostly a positive experience! The girl who took my order was extremely friendly and greeted me promptly when I walked in. I went with the #2 Dave's World-Famous sub. It was awesome and I highly recommend it for anyone who loves horseradish sauce. The only reason I gave this a 4 star is purely based on the bread. The crust was pretty rock hard and could have been a little softer. Fairly priced for the regular at $5.99. Definitely worth checking it out!"}
{"text":"Meh. Second time I've used that in a review. Had the Crazy Dave, on the menu #1 sub in Cleveland, and was bored by it. Let it be known that I've eaten at the original way back when it first opened (97? 98?) and thought it just ok then. 

Certainly better than the larger chains and a bit more creative, but subs seem to lack a real direction. Almost like they just toss together ingredients and see if they sell. 

Give me an \"Italian\" sub that makes me crave it (capicola, salami, pesto, ...)  and I will be back and sing high praises.

Grateful Dead music is appreciated, but felt that it was forced. I went to 106 shows. How many have the staff been to?"}
{"text":"Absolutely love having this place near our home. They have great subs with fresh ingredients with quick and excellent service. Hope Dave's stays around for a long time !"}
{"text":"Excellent subs.

I'm not a vegetarian, but I will swear by the Haight Ashbury (#10) , with roasted red peppers, green peppers, sliced banana peppers, and lots of other goodness.  

Then again, I'm obsessed with green peppers, and peppers generally."}
{"text":"Not a fan - Why is the bread so hard? I would love to enjoy a sandwich without injury.  

ouch."}
{"text":"Concerning some of the negative reviews, the bread is not stale. It's quite good actually. It's a crusty type of bread that's very popular. If you think that indicates stale then you know very little about bread. As for the pickles, no they are not those cheap vinegar soaked things grocery stores call pickles. These are old style fermented pickles (like wine, cheese etc) and are  subtle and tasty. The subs are great and beat out, by far, the other sub shops around. All in all this is where I go for subs and I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"If you're just looking for outstanding subs, this is the place. My wife and I cannot get enough of this place. That Dave's secret sauce is something to behold!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place tonight and I will be back! A bit of a hippy, 70's theme going on with the decor, but some good jams coming off the sound system. I got a couple sandwiches to share and try. The roast beef/horseradish sandwich was okay, but the turkey/avocado sandwich was really tasty and I like how they include a pickle with your order. What made my experience really great was how friendly and patient the two staff members were towards me when I had no idea what to order. 

Prices are higher than a chain place like Subway, but I would say the food quality and  friendly staff are worth the little extra."}
{"text":"The #1 was too heavy on the sauce and white onion, but overall not a bad cold cut sandwich!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite sub shop ever, sad to see some people keep reviewing it negatively over the parking spot (which by the way is super clearly marked for carryout only with a time limit so it is 100% the person parking there's fault). I park there everytime I get carryout, which is a lot and as an actual paying customer I am very thankful the management is willing to go to bat for us and keep people from parkly there incorrectly. Crocker Park has bad parking and without the lonely take out spots there's never an empty one for at least a block or more or worse in the parking garage... not good for someone who wants takeout! 

Back to the food, ANYTHING with cosmic sauce is key but my usual is the Famous Blue (not the cordon bleu which is also good), if you don't like spice just get it without the peppers. It is perfection in a sandwhich! The blu cheese dressing and the dave's cosmic sauce together are heavenly!!! Even the chips, dirty chip brand, are unique and tasty, I recommend the funky fusion!"}
{"text":"The BF and I came here thinking we were gonna grab a small sandwich each for a late lunch. But we ended up getting a large each and having it for an early dinner. 

The large sandwiches are actually two smalls, and I was stuffed to the point of almost feeling sick, but a supper satiated sick. Hahaha. 

I had a 'Super Dave', a sandwich on toasted sourdough bread with \"Pastrami, Corned Beef, Mayo, Lettuce, Mustard, Tomatoes, all Topped With a Generous Portion of Dave's Homemade Cole Slaw, Herbs, and Don't Forget the Dave's Cosmic Sauce.\"

The BF had a 'Crazy Dave', also on toasted sourdough, consisting of \"Prosciutto, Capicola, Hot Peppers, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions, Fresh Garlic, Provolone Cheese, Sprinkled With Crushed Red Peppers, Herbs, and Dave's Cosmic Sauce.\" 

Only way I can think to describe Dave's Cosmic Sauce, is a creamy garlic sauce with extra hidden flavors that explode on your tongue. 

No doubt Im coming back here again. An amazing sandwich experience. Gotta try other options."}
{"text":"1st time trying DCS, wont go back. 2 slices of ham does not make a sub."}
{"text":"Dave's Cosmic Subs is an icon in North East Ohio. I have friends around the country, and I shake my head when I hear them talking about how much they like Jimmy Johns. Dave's is on an entirely different level.

The Kent location is not a disappointment - everything I expect from Dave's. I usually order takeout and now delivery - through the local startup Local Munchies which is a middleman delivery service which allows normal restaurants to offer online delivery orders to customers, which I love.

Subs can be a bit messy -- but they're worth it. They use great crusty baguettes for the subs. Meats are high quality, vegetables are fresh, and they have great unique condiments. There is no better sandwich in Kent. Forget Subway. Forget Jimmy Johns. Forget Mr. Hero."}
{"text":"Crusty bread, copious banana peppers, dousing of \"Dave's Special Sauce\" aka Italian Dressing, and cucumbery pickles. Eff yeah. 

I've been eating at Dave's original Chagrin Falls location since I was in high school (10 years or so), and I'm a little embarassed to say that I've only ever ordered the Turkey Dave, because it's so delightful... why stray from a classic?"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years. Love the atmosphere. Everyone there is hard working and kind. The sandwiches never disappoint. The bread is always crispy, the meat is fresh cut, the fixings fresh and if course Dave's delicious sauce. My son from New York and  daughter and her boyfriend from France, whenever in town, always have Dave's Cosmic Subs as a must eat before returning home. It's a small building but that's part of the charm."}
{"text":"Always fresh, delicious and filling. Grums in Cleveland Heights had always been my favorite but Dave's has them tied."}
{"text":"I'm in love with their meatball subs. The tangy sauce along with the marinara is delicious!"}
{"text":"Took too long to get our food. Subs were ok, not great. The menu is also a bit overwhelming."}
{"text":"I ordered the meatball sub over the phone and it was ready when I arrived. The decor is fantastic! Very Coventry with bands and music memorabilia all over. I wanted to buy a brownie but being $3.99 I decided not too but opted for a chocolate chip which was good as well as my sub."}
{"text":"Good food and service but tables, chairs and floor are gross. I was only customer in there most of the time and no one took initiative to clean the sitting area. Little pricey too...over $10 for a regular sized sub, little bag of chips and no drink. I'll prob return for food cuz it's delicious but not eat in."}
{"text":"This sub shop is different than your average subway. I think you have a much better selection and it always taste a bit better to me. Very time I go I always get the Turkey Dave and I haven't been disappointed yet. Also during one visit I actually met Dave in the shop. An owner that cares about his business and that his customers are satisfied always marks highly in my book."}
{"text":"Tried the Veg-out sub, hoping for a healthy meal.  Good lord, there were about two raw mushrooms and a few banana peppers on it.   Oh and a leaf of lettuce.   But it was filled with about a half a pound of shredded (unmelted) cheese.   It was a basically a shredded cheese sandwich.   And to crank the calorie count up, it was slathered with \"special sauce\" (italian dressing).  
Really dissapointed."}
{"text":"I love this daves. They take the time to get to know their customers and learn they're regulars orders. That goes a long way! The guys that work there are great and extremely friendly!"}
{"text":"There are three simple, yet critical, ingredients that make for an outstanding sandwich. Good bread, high quality meats, and great dressing. And while it seems simple, many places still miss the mark. Dave's has nailed all three. These cosmic subs are a cut above the competition when it comes to the art of sandwhich making. Having tried nearly 30% of the menu, I'm convinced there isn't one bad thing on it. Dave's is an iconic Cleveland Heights staple and one which still knows how to deliver the goods."}
{"text":"Amazing meatball subs and I must say the Dave's sauce is to die for.  I highly recommend picking up a bottle they sell it for retail.  Avoid the pickles they are terrible,  but everything else is great."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty sandwiches! Also the fries are pretty good..
The staff were friendly and helpful. 
The pickle was blah though. I didn't care for it..
I'd definitely come back.."}
{"text":"UNBELIEVABLY FANTASTIC!!! The Tuna Dave and hot dogs are just incredible!!! I crave the subs on a daily basis. The bread is outstanding and the subs are jam-packed full of quality. It is expensive, but in my opinion, worth it!! There is hardly room to sit inside and never a place to park which is a real pain in the rear. I usually have to park relatively far away and walk, but again, it is worth it!! That is how friction' great these subs are!!!!"}
{"text":"From out of town and only been once. The service was great and the atmosphere is cool, if you like psychedelic/rock theme. The ingredients were fresh and bread was ok. The issue I had was the shredded cheese on the sandwiches, very odd. I guess being from New England I'm not use to that! Locals love this place and I'm going to try it again. The spot in Chagrin Falls is small and you probably won't get a seat. However, they have shops all over so I'm sure the other spots a bigger if your with a group. I recommend trying Dave's!"}
{"text":"Always consistent. Sandwiches very good.  Clean good prices. Quick.  Pickles are the hit.   Try different sandwiches. Ul find one"}
{"text":"I don't even like banana peppers. What have you done to me Dave?! My husband raves about this place. I've only ever had the turkey dave, because when you've found the one you don't keep looking. the Dave sauce is everything it's cracked up to be. The french bread is perfectly crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. And they serve Funky Fusion Dirty chips, which you can't find too often."}
{"text":"Flavorful subs at good prices. YUM"}
{"text":"From CA.  If this place makes the best subs in Cleveland then i have something to look forward to when i move back to the by area.  Cleveland in general is depressing.  I thought no there are probably 3 really good restaurants here and the rest are on this level."}
{"text":"I'm usually one to write a review about just food, but the service here was terrible.

The blonde cashier was ( obviously miserable)and intimidating. Instead of promptly welcoming me and taking my order, she made sure to scream at the girl actually MAKING the subs about something really minimal... Multiple times.

Poor brunette wasn't trying to cause a scene, but the blonde was and it was VERY Unprofessional. 

To the brunette -- my San Fran was better than ever!!!! Thank you! 

To the blonde -- get a new job."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite sub shops. Wish they had one in NC. I always get the Dave's Original. Yum!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!  New management and staff are friendly and accommodating.  I love the new look in there. Super clean and inviting.  Best subs ever!"}
{"text":"I went there today and it was incredible. I ordered a small Original Dave's Sandwich. After one bite, I understood why this place has so much hype.

I quickly finished half of the sandwhich, and proceeded to go back to the counter to order another sandwhich for later tonight.

Sandwhich nirvana."}
{"text":"If you are ever in the Chagrin Falls area, this place is a MUST to go visit. I've always been a big fan of their subs. I always get Dave's Best Meatball ever or the Pizza sub.  It's definitely something you won't experience anywhere else. Staff is super cool. Always go there when I visit home."}
{"text":"I LOVE Dave's Cosmic Subs. The Grateful Dave is WHERE IT'S AT! I find myself craving if I don't have it for too long. Turkey, banana peppers, sprouts, avocado and it's the Cosmic Sauce that really makes this sub! The Haight-Ashbury and Turkey Dave are also great options...but ooooh that Grateful Dave!!! Definitely give that one a try!!!"}
{"text":"You guys are awesome! Wandered into your place after hearing rave reviews from other conference goers and was pleasantly surprised. I'm not big on subs, but you guys won me over with your Dave's Bleu, cool guys taking/making my order, and the outstanding character of the place. A very Haight/Ashbury vibe which I'm not too into, but can definitely appreciate."}
{"text":"Black Keys blaring, Jerry staring down from above (along with KWS, Jimi, and John), Fancy pop (soda), write your name on the walls, its encouraged.  Might be hard for a member of Nixon's silent majority to cut through waves of hippie vibrations.  But the powers of music, peace, and the smell of Dave's Cosmic Sauce will bring even the proudest of conformist to the counter.

First time visit, I would recommend checking the menu online.  I had to stand a while and read though all the possibilities.  This can take a while.  Another tip, after eating, do not exhale in public for the next 2-3 hours.  The stain these subs leave on your breath has staying power (aka Dave's Cosmic breath).

Recommend: 
The Original Dave's Cosmic Sub, Dave's San Fran

Don't recommend:
The \"Hey Dave\", The quasi pickle that comes with the sandwich(you will either love or hate this)"}
{"text":"So excited to have a Dave's near me.  

Dave's is a chain of sub resaurants that prouces samiches better than subway.  I recommend on your first trip have The Original Dave's Cosmic Sub.  Then grow from there."}
{"text":"My daughter came into get a sub for the first time and immediately was sick; throwing up. Clearly food poisoning. I called the store and spoke with the manager to bring the issue to her attention, to prevent anyone else from getting sick from their food. She completely denied the possibility of it being the store's fault and did not even apologize. Poor customer service. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I like the sandwiches and the selection, but the bread is pretty bad.  I sometime cut the roof of my mouth on it.  ouch.  I usually get the classic dave or whatever it's called."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Daves. This location tends to be REALLY heavy handed with the Daves Sauce, but other than that, never had a bad experience here. Sandwiches are always piled high, ingredients are always exactly what the description says. 

I totally agree with  the other reviews that say the pickles are not super pickled. They are just cucumbers in vinegar, no spices, no dill, nothing. I don't mind them but I can totally see that being a disappointment."}
{"text":"I pass by the shop daily during the week and, finally with my July 7th tattoo appointment at voodoo monkey, I went in. I had Daves veg out and it was lovely!! I'm not a huge fan of banana peppers, but, I wanted my first to be the way Dave intended. It was so very good!! I love the funky decor too!! I'm sure I'll be back regularly!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I've never had a bad experience at this location. It's become a weekly lunch stop on Fridays for a coworker and I."}
{"text":"I've been going back to this place as often as i can. Still great. I've gotten other family members to try it and they all really enjoyed it.

The other review on here says the bread cut the roof of their mouth? Really? You must have a weak mouth. The bread has always been really good and just the right amount of crustiness to it. 

I've been to this place over a dozen times now and have always had a good sandwich from them."}
{"text":"Excellent sub shop with reasonable prices. I had the Dave's Far Out Chicken and it was one of the best subs I've ever had, and I'm fat so I've had a lot of subs."}
{"text":"A staple of Chagrin Falls, and where every high school kid in the area goes.  The subs are excellent- Dave's special sauce makes them so.  maybe a little too much cheese, but who cares, take it off.  they are GOOD.  I make a point to stop by every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I love Dave's. I have been to several locations including one at Emory. I really like the Italian and the Tuna Dave. The Kent location has great service and they have a very customer friendly attitude. I am not sure why, maybe oven temperature calabration settings, but their bread is not quite as soft as Hudson's.  Probably the same ovens but a lot newer than Hudson. This is still a great place for sandwiches."}
{"text":"I have been eating Daves for 10+ years. I have enjoyed every sub I've ever ordered and specifically love their veggie burger. The only thing I am slightly disappointed by lately is that the pickles now come out of a jar and are not the same as they used to be. As far as the subs... love the cosmic sauce and spicy mayo. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Oh, and I always order mine HOT."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place and I'm pretty critical. I love the meatball sub and the Dave's Original, but it's better hot.
Good selection of Dirty Chips and sodas."}
{"text":"I'm a firm believer in giving any new place I try a second chance. So after a first try fail a few months back we gave Dave's another go tonight. Still unimpressed.

I got the Hey Dave. Just a basic roast beef, cole slaw, Swiss, and some special sauce. Should be a pretty good sammy! Well, it was alright. Nothing special to reflect the premium pricing or the boasting of being the best sandwich shop in Cleveland.

One bite of the pickle and it went straight to the trash. It was intolerably salty. There was no other flavor layer. Pure salt. 

Throughout the bread was a layer of two slices of roast beef. Two. Like Subway style. The rest of the sandwich was then stuffed with the coleslaw, lettuce, and the proprietary sauce. All three of these items were okay. But I like coleslaw on my sandwiches. I don't like coleslaw sandwiches.

Down to the bread. It seems like it's made fresh which is awesome but maybe not stored properly? We ordered later in the day. The outside had a nice crunchy crust to it but the inside had no soft chew to offset it. It ended up being just flakey and dry throughout. Thank goodness for all that coleslaw and sauce!

It's an indie business and clearly people really like it which I always like to see. But I just feel that for what they charge, it should be a little bit better. It's just not for me I guess."}
{"text":"Dave's is great. Solid choices and a great sub sauce make this place unique. Always consistently solid bread, toppings, and quality. Don't forget to refrigerate the sauce if you take one home."}
{"text":"Came here for some local fare and grabbed a steak sub (#29 I think).  Good taste that hit the spot.  The veggies tasted fresh and the steak was good.  It was better than most steak subs I've had from a sub shop.  For some reason, what stood out most was the crisp green peppers.  This sub had its own unique taste, meaning it tasted better/fresher than your typical franchise sub shops.  I'd come back again if in the area."}
{"text":"Subs are decent and pretty cheap. If you go on a Saturday or sometime during the summer there will probably be a long board in your way while waiting in line. If it is crowded just take your food to go because someone might ask you about the type of vibes your trying to give off."}
{"text":"Lots of sub shops in town but this one still holds well. Tasty choices at average prices. It also appeared that they deliver which could be handy for us busy folk. I didn't like their chips so much"}
{"text":"We have been here several times, and every time it's great. The crazy Dave, meatball, and turkey sub are awesome. Would highly recommend. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Dave's cosmos is literally the best sub shop I have ever been to for many reasons. Their food is delicious, the bread is crisp, and fast too! It's always a plus that it is a local sub shop. I usually order delivery and they NEVER disappoint! The staff have always been super friendly and let's not forget that the food is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Dave's is a solid local chain. It originated in Chagrin Falls, and any Ohioan will tell you that a trip to get a Dave's sub is an NEO right of passage.

In truth, I'm not like a die-hard Dave's fan, but I do like the #18 with the Italian sausage. The Dave's Marinara sauce is soooo delicious, and when it soaks into the bread it basically creates this hot mess that's really tasty and requires approximately 100 napkins. Its pretty much the only sandwich I've had at Dave's that keeps me coming back. I need to give major props to this location. Usually, this sandwich takes 10+ minutes to make at other locations (which they disclose), but for some reason, its always ready in just a few short minutes in Hudson. Not sure why, but it just comes out super speedy.

Love the decor in this Dave's (and all Daves'). You can't beat the retro-hippie-vintage-music inspired vibes, which radiate in the form of hand-drawn art, records, and vintage posters. This is sort've the way to my heart... good music. Also, today, a super cute guy and I had an eye contact moment, so that rules. I'll visit again."}
{"text":"Having lived in Cleveland my whole life, I know Dave's is totally a \"thing\" - particularly in the college areas I went to for undergrad and grad school. 

To be honest, my friends have always been obsessed with Dave's. I never totally saw the hype, probably because I wasn't ordering the right thing. When a new location opened up in Solon, I thought it was time for another try. First thing I noticed: Their. Phone. Never. Stopped. Ringing. Apparently they do some kick butt catering or you can call ahead. The guy working the phone was writing a mile a minute. Bless his heart. The inside was quiet, clean, and surprisingly much larger then I expected (you can still see the bones of all the former coffee shops in this building, RIP).

Because my prior orders in other Dave's locations never left me thrilled, I decided to order something opposite of what I normally would choose, the Dave's Famous Italian Sausage. I'm not totally sure why I haven't ordered this every time. The portion of sausage was huge, and the combo of the tomato sauce/cosmic sauce left a good, rich kick in every bite. I love a sandwich that is served hot and has original flavors. This one left me full ALL DAY. Dave's has a fairly big menu, so take it from me on my lesson learned: might take a few times before you find a sub you like, but it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the big deal is about this place. When I ordered a large \"specialty\" sub for eight dollars, I expected something that I couldn't find at, like, a normal chain sub place. It wasn't a terrible experience, mind you, but when I waited 15 minutes for a tiny baked sub the size of a small-ass Quizno's sammich, I was a bit taken aback. At least you know what you're getting with the ilk of Subway (plus they're way cheaper)."}
{"text":"Had a coupon burnin' a hole in my pocket for this place and I wanted to give it a go so I stopped in one afternoon before work.  When they say \"11am\"...they mean 11am.  Not a minute sooner.  By the 4 people milling about, outside I would say that's a good sign.  The kid whom took my order had the personality of a turkey baster.  Watched the kid making the subs microwave all the meat that was being used.  Kinda bummed me out for what they charge for these puppies.  Nevertheless, these were some damn good subs!  Im not usually a sub guy.  About as fun as a colonic but these subs are so good, I would eat them DURING a colonic..."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot and a fantastic alternative to Jimmy John's or Subway if you're looking for a sub done right!"}
{"text":"Chagrin Falls

Man i loved DCS but the owner is just a ass....after watching him take down a 15yo kid over hot peppers on his sub.
i will never be seen there again."}
{"text":"Overall: 4 stars.  It's a local sub chain, which I like to support.  Food is good but prices are a bit on the high side.

Prices: 3 stars.  They are a bit on the high side for a sub chain.

Food: 4 stars.  They have quality ingredients and meats.  As others have mentioned, the break is more hard than most sub places, but that's how Dave's designed it.  It takes a bit getting used to, but I don't mind.  I think they need to reduce the size of their menu; there are probably 30-40 choices and it's a bit overwhelming to read through all of it.

Store Appearance: 4 stars.  It has a fun, rock-and-roll decor.  There are 8-10 tables."}
{"text":"The best subs in the area. It's the sauce that separates Dave's from the rest. All locations are good, but this one is always very friendly."}
{"text":"Pickles. 

I really love pickles.

One of my bucket list items is to be a pickle taster at the county fair. Yeah. And I'm not ashamed of that. 

So imagine my surprise, while unwrapping my first DCS, when a lovely, crunchy, garlic spear rolled out. 

Made my day.  
Was like catching a rare Pokemon. 

The place is über kitschy with a 60's hippie theme. The creator of DCS is a child of that time and it shows in the psychedelic marketing. 

The selection of subs is plentiful.  Actually one of the DCS sandwiches was voted best sandwich in Ohio. Lofty.

I ordered the Grateful Dave. My bread was tough, threw the ends away...but, the sub itself was delicious. Stuffed with lots of good things: turkey, bean sprouts, avocado, red onions, mayo and...wait for it...Daves Cosmic Sauce. 

Excuse me, could I have a tub of the Cosmic Sauce to go? Thank you. 

I wish the bread would've been fresh, I might have given four stars.

(Also, seating...really not any inside.  To wicked hot to sit outside. So we ate in the car)"}
{"text":"Dave's is one of my favorite places to get a sandwich and this location just happened to be my first experience. I've been back a couple times since. It's a good spot to grab some quick grubbed before game nights at my buddy's place up the street. There is a new location that opened close to home now so I tend to go there more often but the point is, Dave's rocks!

The trippy decor is homage to all things psychedelic, music and pop culture. Take a look around to find your favorite artists on the walls.  The service mimics this and is very laid back and chill but they take care of you at the same time.  I've always had a quick and interactive experience with these guys, even when we have 5 guys placing orders. Maybe 10 minutes tops to get all of our food and out the door.  We typically get orders to go but there is plenty of room inside to eat and it always looks clean.

I've had a lot of sandwiches but the standouts for me are, the Original Dave, Crazy Dave and Dave's World Famous. Make sure you get lots of Dave's Cosmic Sauce! This stuff is killer!  Dave's Horseradish on the World Famous is pretty rad too!  They load up the sandwiches with fresh meats and veggies to the point that it almost doesn't close. Grab a bag of Dirty Chips while you are at it and you have a sandwich meal worthy of  your hard earned money!  Salt & Vinegar Dirty chips are my poison. Oh, almost forgot about the pickle.  A delicious garlic pickle comes with every sandwich order.  They are different at first but you grow to like them.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I love Dave's.  Best bread, best meat, love the Cosmic Sauce.  The staff is always pleasant.  And I love the rock and roll stuff."}
{"text":"My wife tried one of the hot dogs today - wow, it was great!"}
{"text":"I am a Dave's Cosmic Subs lover and have enjoyed their sandwiches for years. Unfortunately, I find that the employees are lacking customer service skills across the franchise (having dealt with some rude employees and managers at the UH location a couple years ago). The new Ohio City shop is no exception. After trying to stop by a few times and finding it closed we finally made it in yesterday evening. The store was empty as it was about an hour before closing time. The cashier was friendly enough but when he asked the cook if I could try the soup he rudely replied they didn't give samples. No big deal. I went on to order my sub and while I was ordering another customer walked in.  After finishing my order my husband took a few seconds to continue looking at the menu (less than 30 seconds) and the cook rudely said (loud enough for my husband and I to hear) \"if this guy doesn't hurry up the other customer is going to leave!\".  I immediately felt uncomfortable and asked my husband to step aside so they could take the order of the man behind us.  At that point we felt we should leave. If they cannot treat customers with respect and wait for them to make their order I don't need to be there. If a customer cannot wait 90 seconds to have his order taken then he needs to relax as well (and believe me I think he would have waited, but apparently the employees did not have his same patience). Lastly, if they were really so concerned with a customer walking out because he had to wait a minute or two to have his order taken (which is a ridiculous concept) then they could have kindly said \"if you are still deciding do you mind if we take the order behind you\".  We would have had no problem with that at all. Yelling to make my husband uncomfortable lacks professionalism and common sense (Common sense as our order would have been two sandwiches and sides whereas the other customer just got one sub). I would have asked for the employees name and managers contact information, but unfortunately I know that this is just how Dave's operates. We won't be going back as there are enough great sub shops in Cleveland with kind, accommodating employees. 

If Dave's motto is \"Peace, Love, Subs\" they need to work on the Love part.   No sandwich is worth dealing with their inept employees who lack people skills."}
{"text":"Great local sandwich franchise. Tons of choices, and much tastier ingredients than any national chain. I wish they could keep later hours."}
{"text":"I imagine this is what a sub shop under the bridge would be like. This place has more graffiti than a train yard and the School for Creative Vandalism combined. Which of course is nothing but a good thing. 

Dave's has a truly imposing selection of submarine sandwiches. And a bit of an unusual selection of different kinds of crisps. As an obvious alternative to Subway, you will be blown far and away by the unexpected homemade quality. The Dave's Famous Bleu was the culprit for this conclusion. 

Put on your grungy trench coat, hunch over and slouch in here. Then inhale a sub. You'll thank me later. (Because my real name is Dave. I am the Real Dave. ((Not true. I lied.)) )"}
{"text":"Let's start with the fact that I always love a good turkey sub. I came here after a botched attempt at getting my blood drawn meaning I hadn't ate in over 12 hours and was about to cry in anticipation. Pro: they have 27 options. Con: when you're so hungry you could cry it's hard to read through 27 options. I asked the woman working there what her favorite one was and she listed three for me. I picked the Grateful Dave because it had turkey and some type of hot pepper sauce. 

Service was fast and polite. The inside is a little dingy and dirty looking. As in there is one folding table inside so if you're looking to eat in I would look elsewhere. 

I wanted to love this place, and it was good- but not as good as I wanted it to be. I will say the daves special sauce is phenomenal. They also have a ton of chip options to go with it which I wish I would have looked at before I said no. 

Anyway, the way the toppings were with how shallow the bread was meant the fillings kept shooting out the top and I was basically left with a bread/sauce taco. I liked how the bread tasted but it was very crusty which definitely made the sandwich hard to eat. Additionally, my pickle was pretty, how do I say this, waxy? I love pickles and usually don't discriminate (except for sweet pickles, sorry guys) and I threw most of this one away.  

Another thing I thought was odd was the fountain drinks were the same price as the bottled sodas ($1.70) I don't know about you but for somewhere I'm not getting free refills at I feel like that's a little steep for a fountain drink. I've gotten 32 oz for $0.60 pretty regularly so that irked me AND it was flat. 

All and all it cost me about $10 for my sub, a drink, and a $1 tip. I wish they would throw a little money in making this less divey on the inside. I love a good hole in the wall but this doesn't fit that bill. Will try again because I love how many options they have and I love supporting local businesses"}
{"text":"Yum! For some reason this Dave's tastes so much better than the one in Lakewood- I'm not sure why. I like to stop in here before heading to TJ's for groceries so I don't bring home the entire store. Okay let's be honest, I think I'll be fine without dinner so I go to TJ's and buy the entire store then get Dave's and retreat to closet eat in my car. Dave's cosmic sauce is to die for. It's super tangy and delicious (and vegan!) so there's nothing not to love there. Apparently they sell it in store and at Heinen's so that's definitely on my list.

There are a ton of sandwich options so initially it might be a bit overwhelming but it's definitely worth it in my opinion. A lot of the options have banana peppers which probably is why this place makes me so happy. I bought a new car and have vowed to not eat in it (we'll see how long that lasts) so the most recent time I was in I ate in store which is kinda rare imo. Contrary to the other recent reviews, the staff was exceptionally nice. They checked in on me halfway through to make sure it was good and I didn't need anything else and someone even came out to ask if they could throw away my trash for me while I was messing with my phone which I wasn't expecting at all. So yeah, get you a tasty sub in a groovy lil shop and enjoy your day!"}
{"text":"Whenever I have out of town guests I always bring them to Dave's Cosmic Subs and it never fails to be an instant hit. They go home and rave about it, and tell others about it. They cannot wait to come back. Except this one time on 4.21.18. Whoever was talking orders at the Chagrin store around 2:30 pm is ruining your brand. She ignored us for a few minutes while taking a phone order, which I totally get and am fine with. Afterwards, she seemed to have other matters to attend to which confused me. There was no one else in line.Then, she seemed to realize we were there and took our order. In the middle of the order, and a whispered conversation with someone in the kitchen,  she said \"we're out of...\" but then stopped and continued her secret conversation with...?  I assumed all was well but then when I got home and ate the sandwich, I realized whatever they were \"out of\" must have been important, because it tasted awful. What the heck? I have her a tip too because I didn't want to be a jerk but she really gave awful customer service and clearly doesn't care about your company. Maybe she'll be a rocket scientist some day but for now your might want to stick her in the back spreading  mayo. Thank goodness I didn't bring business colleagues there that day, what an embarrassment that would have been. I get that everyone has an off day but..."}
{"text":"I had to wait 45 minutes for my corned beef, but I don't mind waiting(it was peak hours and I'm not unreasonable).  Staff was friendly enough, but the quality was mediocre.  It was my first time trying Dave's, so I'll try something different next time."}
{"text":"This is great lunch food for not much more than $6. Good sandwiches and always friendly service. I love how all their sandwiches are on the spicy side, however i can see how a lot of people dont like the spiciness. Regarding the bread - it's much better than Subway. It's crusty italian - not soft and soggy. I wouldn't say the bread is \"tough\".

the wait is a while - i always order ahead of time and walk to pick up my order. Always ready when I get there."}

Nice baguettes..."}
{"text":"\"Whoa dude. Where's my sub? I think I kinda left it at Daves. But ya know, there was like Morrison playing and all, and so I'm not totally sure. But, ferreal, you just gotta check out this joint. It's totally gnarly.

There's crazy artwork on the walls with portraits of various gods of rock. There are vintage posters, completely psychedelic. But then there's the business, and the business is 100% East Coast deli serious business. Nobody behind the counter is on reefer, or if they are, it doesn't screw with their handle.

The menu is plain and clear. Dave doesn't make you freak out on trippy names for their subs. I had the Kosher Corned Beef. On rye of course. Simple, delicious. Good meat.

Sandwiches are moderately sized and priced. You're not going to bust a gut or your wallet, and it's mmm mmm tasty. Wait. Am I channeling Quiznos? Hey, forget them. Dave's is not chain bait, so all you VC types take a chill pill. This model doesn't scale. It's a perfect, neighborhood deli with first rate goods and prompt service. It's all about a good guy who has done a good job and he's not trying to change the world one high concept sandwich at a time. He's just feeding the lunch crowd in suits with a no-nonsense classic rock attitude.

Still, I wish there was one in California.\""}
{"text":"The food deserves 5 stars and the service 3  thus my rating of 4 stars.  

My office orders lunch 2 to 3 times per week and I believe we have found our new \"go to\" delivery.  

I had the peace steak without tomatoes and mushrooms.  The sandwich was excellently prepared.  The meat was tender and juicy, the Dave sauce is phenomenal and the roll was perfectly toasted with a nice crunch but not hard.  I also had the fries which I shared because the order was large enough for two.  They were some of the best fries I've had in a long time.

\"B\" had the Hey Dave sub and said that it could have had more meat and less coleslaw but it was good.  

My boss got the peace steak as well and said that she would get the Sauce on the side next time because it was amazingly good but crazy messy. 

We will definitely order from here again soon.

They did not charge us a delivery fee, so make sure you tip the driver."}
{"text":"Dave's is a legendary Cleveland sandwich shop overflowing with hippie bric-a-brac. The walls of the downtown location are covered in paintings of Jerry Garcia and his ilk, all beaming high watt smiles and basking together in colorful angelic relief. While the staff are pleasant enough, the dining area is thimble-sized, with tables wedged so closely together there is hardly room to queue up to order. One guest found it reminiscent of that Far Side cartoon where the two insects are imagining how frightening their dwelling will look when the obelisk-like potato at the center inevitably begins to sprout. Imagine that and you'll have some idea of the claustrophobia of this location. To make matters worse, the speaker mounted over the drink cooler is dialed up to 11. You've never heard \"Obla Di Obla Da\" until you've heard it from a ten ton megaphone directly above your skull. The veggie burger was of a soft and savory consistency, and loaded up with fresh lettuce/tomato, and some really zippy mayo, but it was incredibly small for the $7.75 price point. A five-eight bite affair, maximum. The pickles are love 'em or hate 'em: rather soft as well, and with a vinegar-rinse aftertaste. In sum, Dave's is a tiny blip on the downtown foodie map--tasty if pricey, and best eaten out in the sunshine."}
{"text":"I had an 8 inch meatball sub. 3 large meatballs toasted with sauce and cheese. It was  sloppy but good. My  Boyfriend had a  Dave's original 16 inch sub which had pepperoni, salami, and prosciutto along with veggies and Dave's sauce. He enjoyed his sub. With a medium soda the bill came to 19.50$. There are only 3 tables for eating in and no public bathrooms to wash your hands ."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Bread was old and falling apart. Shredded cheese was waxy and flavorless and sparse. We ended up just tossing most of it out. The kids wanted nothing to do with them. I think they are spoiled by Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"LOVE. Absolutely sandwich love. When I eat other sandwiches, I compare it to Dave's (that's how much I love this place)."}
{"text":"Pretty sure I am giving myself whiplash over how quickly I am changing my mind about this place. The previous two times I came here, it was hunky dorey! The sandwiches of course could not compare to the original location, but were acceptable based off of convenience and the fact that I am in love with Dave's Special Sauce. This last visit though... HORRENDOUS. We placed a work order well ahead of pick-up time. Upon arrival NOTHING IS MADE. So of course, they continue being slow and take 45 minutes to make our order wrong. Wrong wrong wrong. Look at my sandwich! It was suppose to be a Grateful Dave. I missed you, turkey meat. You would have really made my night if you had been placed on my sandwich. 

I didn't even bother calling to complain. I'm going to just assume the people working are underpaid college students that were perhaps being influenced by other things at the moment."}
{"text":"Love! BEST SANDWICH EVER. I love the baguette-esque bread, the sauce they smother their sandwiches in, and the variety of options. I always go back to the Sloppy Dave, but other sandwiches I've tried are also tasty. The prices are even decent. I have yet to find a different sandwich shop to steal my heart away. 

P.S. The jalapeno chips are delicious, splurge the extra $1 and grab a bag. Don't spend the extra money on the cookies/brownies though."}
{"text":"A little pricey for what you are getting, I tend to be a subway fan overall.  Nonetheless the subs are good.  Don't plan on eating while you are there.  This location and their Westlake location have little to no seating.  A few tables at best.  The rock memorabilia is nice to look at while you wait.  This place seems to be a little forgettable though.  I haven't been there in some time."}
{"text":"I like this downtown outpost of our local sub chain. The Dave's sauce that they put on almost everything (basically an herb oil) is good, but I always ask for it light. The variety of subs is nice, and I recommend toasting whenever possible. My only qualms with this place are the long wait times (call ahead if you can) and maybe slightly higher than perfect prices."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the vibe and the food. They even bottle their own sodas in a variety of flavors."}
{"text":"Why go to Quizno's or Subway when places like Dave's exist?  The subs are awesome, complete with wild names and far-out ingredient combinations.  From Reubens to garden burgers to hot dogs on a sub, this place has everything!

The Crazy Dave (prosciutto, capicola, hot peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, fresh garlic, provolone cheese, sprinkled with crushed red peppers, herbs, and Dave's Cosmic Sauce) was voted #1 sandwich in Cleveland, but order anything off the menu and I doubt you'll go wrong.  And while we're on the subject of Dave's Cosmic Sauce.  AMAZING.  Adds worlds to the subs.

The subs are usually around $6 or $7 and they also has a wide variety of kid's subs and fresh salads.

The ambiance is also great.  There's always a classic rock DVD playing on a flat screen and the whole place is decked out with vintage band posters/memorabilia.

Check out the sodas in the cooler... crazy flavors!"}
{"text":"I love Dave's Cosmic Subs! The retro hippie vibe is so fun, and each one is decorated a little differently.  There's so much to look at, waiting for your food is kind of fun!  I highly recommend any sub with Dave's Cosmic Sauce on it. It's kind of like a creamy Italian sauce and soooo good! If you want a really fresh tasting sub, my go to is the Turkey Dave.  It has super fresh bread (they all do) turkey, lettuce, tomato, banana peppers, herbs, swiss cheese and of course Dave's Cosmic Sauce! So many subs to choose from but they're all delicious! Also bonus you get such a yummy pickle wrapped with each sub!"}
{"text":"Holy Bejebus! 

This place makes some awesome subs! We ordered a whole bunch of platters for an event at Case Western, and they were worth every penny! Not only were our guests happy that we didn't settle for the typical pepperoni pizza, but the variety of subs really made for interesting eats!

I also have to admit that I LOVE sauces on sandwiches, and this place had some great mixes. If you're looking for a new catering option, try Dave's!"}
{"text":"Best local sub shop all around CLE! Shops are usually small with an old rock feel. Definitely somewhere that will accept you in your tie dye shirt! Food is great, but I stick with the original. Ask for extra sauce because it's awesome."}
{"text":"Awesome subs and salads!!!! Love this place! They have a really good selection of subs and salads. Their fries are so good too"}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of DCS for many years now!  This place, and Jersey Mike's, are my 2 favorite places in NE Ohio to get a great, proper sub with meats cut fresh in front of you!   The employees are nice too, which is always an added plus.  And they have a great collection of various gourmet chips and sodas as well.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on 11/21/17 store is CLOSED ,  gentleman going
into the pizza shop ( next door ) told me the owner wasn't paying 
the rent , said his young friend was working there.      Sub's were
getting crappy , over time.    Great ownership"}
{"text":"mmmm love the garden burger sub.  great options for vegetarians and meat eaters.  great place for fast casual eating."}
{"text":"What is it with some sub shops doing the whole stoner 60's thing? I don't get it. That was my first impression while walking in here.  I mean, I know the name has the word Cosmic in it, but couldn't you go for a space theme instead? Lots of stuff with tie die, the doors, etc.  After I got over that, I stood at the menu and took it all in.I don't know that there isn't a sub that they don't serve here!  The menu was humongous, serving mostly hot subs, but really you can get it any way you like. 

I went with a turkey sub after talking to the counter guy for a while who was super nice and helpful.  Surprisingly, the sub was HUGE. I wasn't expecting that!  I got the meal deal, which came with fountain pop, chips and a drink. After I was done, I went with a brownie to go, since I was traveling and didn't have any form of desert at the hotel.  By the way, the brownie was delicious, and really hit the spot!

Overall, an a okay experience. I'm neither here nor there about this place, but it was pretty good food and the prices were on point.  I would probably go back in the future as the food was good, but I would not classify it as \"go out of my way for this\" food."}
{"text":"Ok where to begin, well I went to the Crocker Park location and realized it wasn't the place I had intended to dine. My friend and I thought what the hell, let's give it a try. We walk into a very tie dyed place that seems like it caters to regulars.

I order the number 14, a hot tuna sub with melted cheese. For the amount I got for the the price I payed I could have walked to Giant Eagle and gotten a Lb of tuna salad and made a better sub myself at home in my pajamas in front of the tv

Onto the quality of the sub. It was sub par, the bread was hard like it had been stored for a day or so before they heated it up. The tuna salad was ok, but who puts melted cheddar on tuna salad?? There was more lettuce on the sub than tuna and as I learned from cooking myself and watching food network, every bite of a sandwich should be the same, they broke this rule.

Finally to end it off, while the staff was polite, they seemed very casual like it was their house, no visible name tags or hats. I just don't think this is my kind of place, I'll be going to jimmy johns or making my own subs at home

As a side note. The menu on the wall looks like one huge license plate. There is no indication of how big a normal or large sub is, no calorie counts for the people who wanna use a weight app to help portion the subs"}
{"text":"Delicious subs!  Hot, crispy bread that resembles more of a true baguette than something from a grocery store.  I had my first sub from Dave's in 2002, and I can honestly say that the quality is consistent.  Anything you get is good. The only thing that could be improved- the kid working the register was clueless."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a sub and wasn't disappointed. Friendly service, high quality sub, cool decor, and a decent sized menu. Great place to get a good sandwich that's a quick in and out."}
{"text":"The price and food is pretty good but the speed of service is lacking greatly, especially during a heavy rush or if someone made a large order via phone.  The way we get our stuff in a decent time is to order what we want via phone before we leave and it is either ready or close to being ready when we get there.  The All American is my go-to sub."}
{"text":"I love the subs and the sauce is very addictive I love to bring home my own bottles of Dave's cosmic sauce! Also you can ask for the bread to not be too toasty because sometimes the bread can be hard and flaky and I like it on the softer side!"}
{"text":"Staff very friendly...sandwiches not so much...need to change the menu and make it simpler, change the bread to less dry, and change sandwiches so that one can bite into them."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I ordered the Crazy Dave and requested it hot. Their garlic herbs sauce/dressing that they use is amazing. The bread was delicious and crunchy and all of the toppings were fresh. The girl who waited on me was very friendly and polite. I will definitely be going back. I have to try the steak and meatball subs!"}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars for service! Then there is the food! Great taste, very subpar on the amount of \"stuff\" you get in the Subs! Weak. Very weak! A few pieces of lunch meat and a TON of salad dressing they call \"special sauce\"....it was far from special. The veggie sub we also got should be called the lettuce and tomato only sub with a boat load of dressing and hot peppers! Threw 3/4 of it away. Gross! Jersey Mike's blows you out of the water by a landslide!"}
{"text":"Tried a Crazy Dave with hot peppers. The sandwich itself wasn't too bad and the cosmic sauce or whatever it is called is tasty. The problem lies with HOW they make the subs. It isn't a true sandwich where you can take a bite as it is open with all the cheese, sauce and peppers on the top and the bread is built around it. It is very difficult to eat to get a bite of meat and toppings all in one. I tried to squish the stuff in there, tried to open by big mouth up bigger and tried to reposition things, but nothing worked. Good sandwich, but had to eat most of it like a salad. Too many sub places, esp in the area that I won't be back."}
{"text":"My daughter says to give this five stars. She is a huge Reuben fan, and they made a huge Reuben for her. Just under $10 for the sandwich, which could be split if your companion is more generous than mine."}
{"text":"This place delivers! The workers are cool ! The tuna sandwich is good to go. I will be eating here again. Good stuff!!"}
{"text":"Wow great subs and the price is ok, the secrete is there saves sauce they use instead of mayonnaise.
The coleslaw well let me just tell you this don't order it figure money whatever made the coleslaw find another job. No taste no flavor just RAW"}
{"text":"Tons of options! Can't wait to try the meatball and some other famous subs! I had the southwestern steak and the bread, and spicy mayo were perfection. Beef was a tiny bit dry, but the seasoning and ingredients were all great. Nice and fast service too! I hope to update this review with 5 stars after trying some more sandwiches."}
{"text":"&@$* Subway!  This place is insanely good.--this is the type of place you will get urges for-at least once a month if not more!  It is the perfect bread to put anything on and if all the other sub places made them as good/fresh as this--oh wait--they don't--so never mind!  You aren't going to find a better sub in the state if Ohio--heck in most of the US.  I travel for a living--I'm located in Florida and I get the urge to drive over and get one of these subs at least once a month.  that's how friggin good they are.  I get mine a little spicy with oil and vinegar-and Swiss.  The look of the restaurant--is very music inspired but has a lot of local flavor--signatures adorn the walls--as anyone can apparently write on the walls, and music rock legends can be seen everywhere.  It's cool--you'll find out.  When I am back in Hudson Ohio I will be stopping by Dave's to get a sandwich!   ::daydreaming about a Dave's  sub::  drools.   Mmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Dave's has the very best garden burger around. You can't get it this good at a chef's restaurant. This burger kills the one at B spot! The melted cheese on top and the spicy mayo is killer! I crave this sandwich! The fresh baked bread can't be replicated anywhere else. This Dave's location is new and fresh and has plenty of seating.  AND this one sells FRENCH FRIES, man are they good fries !"}
{"text":"I've gotten them through uber eats 2 times. Subs turned out fine, but I ordered double meat twice and they both looked like single meat. I will probably not order them off uber eats again, but I'd still go and get their subs."}
{"text":"I'm already a fan of Dave's Cosmic Subs (#8 Crazy Dave no onions is my go-to), full disclosure. But the purpose of this review is to sing its praises for being another late night food option in Ohio City. After a night on the town, it's actually refreshing to have a fairly priced food option (full menu too, not late night menu shenanigans either!). Eat there, take it home or eat your late night treat at Market Square Park! A good spot to add to the store location list for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is great for groups! Get the Daves Original Sub in a large. One sub and a Greek Salad feeds 2 at a very reasonable price! And wait till you taste it! Its amazing literally. There are many fancy places to eat in this town,but this place os legendary. The Pizza Sub is also a great second pick. Did I mention how affordable this place is? Great for a date on a budget. Not to mention its located in Ohio City which is a great town to visit while in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Food was great (turkey club, chocolate chip cookie) and was ready pretty quickly. Service was okay - the guy at the counter was nice, but didn't seem to care much. I was offered a cup for water but was never handed a cup or told where to get it. Also didn't know I had to grab the cookie myself (it was in a cake dish with a kid on it).

I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: this is the only Dave's I've been to. I know nothing of the franchise locations.

Fuck the haters, man. This is the first, the famed, the fantastic Dave's Cosmic Subs and I won't hear a word against it. I've been eating here since I was young and I've had 9 or 10 things from their menu over and over again. I've never had anything bad from them. Dave's Sauce is an awesome, tangy Caesar-dressing-y condiment that goes pretty well on anything. The bread is crunchy, tasty, and a lot to manage, but it's worth it.

The decor is crazy psychedelic and a great break from the Puritanical, stuffy lifestyle of the rest of Chagrin Falls (I'm allowed to say that, it's my hometown). It's Basically a classic rock cathedral in there-- collectible concert posters, painted ceiling.

Recommend: Turkey Dave, Grateful Dave, Haight-Ashbury

Don't trust anyone; go try it yourself. These are the best subs in Cleveland. Their pickles are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Best subs in Cleveland. Love the Grateful Dave and also the owner, Dan is pretty groovy."}
{"text":"Amazing late night sandwiches.  Totally original. Way more flavor than any other chain sub shop. Vegetarian options are really good too."}
{"text":"I was hoping to give a good review.
Price points are the concern:
Very expensive. $7.75 for 6 inch.
There is no 12 inch on the meatball, so if you order that, you will be getting (2) 6 inch sandwiches which is over $15.00. They did not tell us this on the phone.
The veggie sandwich also $7.75 not so good.
There was a spice on it that was very salty.
What about lettuce, tomato and mayo? Would have been so much better.
The meatball was good. But the price on this
is way too expensive.
The store had no business on a Tuesday night. This used to be a great place. The 23.00 total really floored us.
We could have gone out to dinner.  I am a Dave's fan, but unhappy with this experience. This pricing is not reasonable."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for a long time.  Looked like cool atmosphere.  Food was average and way overpriced.  Subs were smaller than expected.  On the other hand, the service was great.  Not sure I would go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"It had been forever since I had a Dave's sub. I was not disappointed. I stopped in on a weekend and it was pretty dead. I ordered a club and a chicken sub. I was a bit disappointed to find out that the chicken is lunch meat style versus real chicken breast. That aside, the subs were good. I got the chicken toasted. The cosmic sauce is what makes it. So freaking good! The pickle was interesting. It tasted more like a pickle so was lightly pickled if you will. I didn't mind it, but my guest didn't enjoy it at all. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Dave's,  what can I say about Dave's that hasn't already been said!  Yes, the subs are yummy.  Do not go with the intension of doing too much to change what they put on it.  Dave likes his subs served as is on the menu.  If you ask for Italian if it doesn't come with Italian, you can have it, but it will come with a frown.  Dave is definitely a character and I think that might be a reflection of the era he grew up in (Dave was DEFINITELY a hippy :)  I've been here many times and tried quite a few of their subs and they are always good and when Dave has been there I can't remember seeing him smile.  I've not ever had a rude server but usually they are so busy when I have stopped that they don't have time to be jovial and chitty chatty either.  I haven't been here for a while, and now, my mouth is watering for a \"Dave's Sub\"!  Try one, you'll like them and the atmosphere will take you back to a cooler time.  (if you are over 60) 8)"}
{"text":"Thank god it's under new management. The store was always dirty but now the new store looks awesome. The new owners are so friendly, and the subs are better then ever you need to go check it out!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing they have the best subs in the area hands-down. the owners one of the nicest guys ever. I read the previous comment about a lady saying he harassed her about a parking spot I was there that day and the owner simply asked her not to park in his only reserve parking spot and she got an attitude and said I will only be 10 minutes and ran off.  Anyways if you're looking for a good place to go to get a sub at crocker park this is definitely the spot!"}
{"text":"This place is one of a kind!  The owner not only remembered me (from one conversation a year ago) but asked me about my sister who hasn't lived in town for years- and even remembered her order.  Talk about making your customer feel appreciated!  On top of how friendly they are, the subs are unbelievable.  Their Dave's Sauce is the reason to go.  I need to get there more often!"}
{"text":"Dave's Cosmic Subs is trippy and yummy all wrapped up in a sub.

The flavors of Dave's subs are good, but I don't go here often because the bread is tough and they put banana peppers on almost all of their subs.  It's not like Subway where you tell the sandwich artist every single topping you want.  Instead, you order the sub and they hand it to you their way.

Dave's is good in that they're unique, but the wait is usually twice as long as other sub shops in the area.  You can call ahead or fax in your order and it should be ready by the time you pick it up, but who does that?

The atmosphere at Dave's is cool, but really small.  I recommend getting your sub to go unless you want people standing over you while they wait in line.  The shop has a high ceiling and lots of Beatles pictures and 60's art, etc.  Definitely a cool, hippy sub shop!

The price of Dave's subs are higher than other sub shops in the area.  I really wish I could say more positive things about this place, but oh well.

{"text":"While I am living in Chicago, I still pine for a Dave's Cosmic sub.... particularly the VegOut. 
There's something about artichoke hearts, romaine lettuce, tomato, banana peppers, and  a handful of mozarella/cheddar cheese mixed with the delicious garlic famous sauce on warm italian bread that makes my mouth water every time I think about it.

I've been to three locations: Hudson (the best in my opinion because the decor is the coolest. Led Zeppelin, the Who, and Doors posters. Tie-dyed walls that numerous customers have scrawled on with sharpies. The ceiling honors dead rock artists). I frequent this location when back at home and eat on the green. 
Coventry. I'm surprised this one isn't like Hudson's since the little town is hippie town central. This is a great location after a few at the Grog Shop. 
Chagrin Falls. I saw Dave (the owner) at this location once. He claimed he wasn't Dave, but I knew it was. 

Only complaint: Very expensive for a sub sandwich that I literally inhale because of its deliciousness. So, this is a great treat when you're tired of the same old Jimmy Johns, Subway, what have you and your wallet is a little fatter. But there's definitely something for every taste bud.... including the health conscious (salads, vegetarian options). Every sub comes with a pickle... and satisfaction that you just ate the best sandwich on earth. 

Peace. Love. Dave's Cosmic Subs."}
{"text":"My co-worker and i decided that we wanted to try someplace new for lunch. We work near Crocker Park, so we always have a lot of options.
We decided on Daves Cosmic Subs today.
We passed the menu around the office and everyone found something they wanted..Which never happens. They have a very large selection of sandwiches.
We walked in with a list of 7 orders.
The gentleman behind the counter was very nice and took our orders. i used to work in restaurants so i know how annoying it can be when offices come in with all thier separate credit cards, but he was so friendly and gave us all separate receipts and even suggested combos to save us money on our drinks and chips.
The man in the back making the sandwiches was chatting with us as well.. he was very nice and made topping suggestions and let us try the \"cosmic sauce\" because we had never had it before (we assusmed it would be mayonaisse based, but it was more like an italian/ caesar dressing, VERY GOOD!)
We got back to the office to hand out everyones lunch. When we looked in the bag, everything was labeled and had cute little pictures on the wrappers drawn by the guys at the shop.
everyone enjoyed thier lunch, and we will definately be going back. 
As far as the food itsself... theyre subs... nothing too spectacular, but with service like that and a sauce that cant be found anywhere else, its a step above your average sandwich shop for sure!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty subs though I always feel like I paid a buck too much. Still, subs are good - especially the toasted ones (my favorite is the Hey Dave). And the service is prompt.
It's a locally owned chain (they have 10 stores now, mostly in/around Cleveland), so that's a plus: each sub you buy is helping Cleveland. 
The decor is outstanding.... lots of hippie memorabilia to stare at while you scarf down a sub. There are only a few tables, but you can usually find a spot.
They also have some soups and chili. I've tried the chili, which is standard fare."}
{"text":"I've never written a Yelp review before, but I just had a terrible lunch at Dave's.   The buns for all 3 sandwiches we ordered were rock hard.  Is that normal?  We would have complained but there was a line and we were in a hurry.   Bummer."}
{"text":"Eaten at Dave's many times; it was my second try that I actually found something tasty, and ever since then, I have been a fan of Dave's. 

I used to love Subways for the $5 specials, but after eating Dave's, it's a whole different world for me. Jimmy John's.. they always always forget my alfalfa sprouts, or it's contaminated, or something. Dave's is around the same price as Jimmy John's for around the same quantity, but they never forget my alfalfa sprouts on the sandwiches that come with them. 

I've tried a bit of flavors at Dave's and have come out to say that I really enjoy Dave's Club, Grateful Dave's (after eating too many Dave's Club), and the Crazy Dave, in that order. I like that they also deliver to around the Cleveland Clinic area, which unfortunately, falls outside of most other delivery zones. There are misses though... if you don't get the right guy in the back making sandwiches, some of the other guys don't put enough sauce, and the sandwich is not as enjoyable. Also, can get slow since I think there's only one guy behind the counter making sandwiches and one girl who works the register and delivers, so careful when you decide on delivery- we usually wait an hour or so for delivery. 

Other nice touches... all of the sandwiches come with a pickle on the side. They taste freshly pickled too, kind of like a cucumber that's just slightly pickled. Yum. Also, when you're waiting, be sure to check out the awesome chips. I have yet to try all the flavors, but so far, I like the salt and vinegar ones :)"}
{"text":"I have been going to daves for years! I love their subs. I usually get the original or tuna melt. I like both. Today I got a side of soup and was NOT impressed. The soup was mostly broth with just a spoonful of noodles and carrots. I spent $4.99 on what was mostly broth! Trader Joe's is across the street and I could get 32OZ of broth for $1.99! Needless to say, I will not be ordering soup there again!"}
{"text":"Dave's Cosmic Subs is an iconic restaurant in downtown Chagrin Falls and they serve the best sub sandwiches in the Cleveland area as far as I'm concerned.  The bread is fresh baked, the ingredients are tasty and of high quality, and the pickles are to die for (just don't ask for extras or where Dave's buys them, it's a 'secret').

My only complaints would be that they do not accept credit cards and that the line can be a bit long.  Oh, and Dave himself isn't exactly the most pleasant bloke in the world, but he's never thrown me out or given me trouble.  Just feign interest in his hair-metal band and/or be an attractive female and you'll do just fine with Dave."}
{"text":"Been to Dave's Cosmic Subs in Mentor numerous times. Great service and the subs are some the best in NE Ohio. Many to choose from, but my favorite is still the Original!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Daves Cosmic Subs. This small store front has ample seating and a television if you decide to dine in. I was greeted almost immediately by the staff. They have a large enough menu to choose from but my only grievance would be that they have only two choices of bread. Italian and wheat. I chose the Daves club sub. This hot sub arrived quickly and came in one size. It was plenty of food. Like many of the other sub chains they only offer a selection of potato chips. However the delicious Deli pickle that came with my meal was a pleasant surprise. I'm not sure if you get the pickle with takeout. As for the price I think they're a little pricey. A large sub is $10.99 which is even higher then DiBella's subs, but don't let that sway you.
With limited locations if you're by one you might want to stop instead of going to one of the other chains that have a storefront on every corner. I will be back."}
{"text":"I had the Super Dave sub -- pastrami, corned beef, cole slaw, and some kind of tangy sauce. It was quite possibly the best sub I've ever had. Definitely will be back for more.  High recommend!"}
{"text":"Dave's is better than jimmy johns but I feel Grum's sub shoppe is better than Dave's. Grum's you get more for your buck and if you have not tried their subs you must. They are located at 1776 Coventry Rd
Cleveland Heights, OH  44118"}
{"text":"The subs are fantastic. I get the original sub and always make sure to grab a bottle of Dave's Cosmic Sauce since it tastes good on just about anything.  We purposely took a detour to stop here for lunch on our way home to Michigan and the whole time we were hoping that Dave wasn't going to be there. We encountered him before when we had family in Chagrin years ago. Luckily this time around his happy, cheerful, and welcoming employees were running the shop instead. 

Stay away Dave, it's better for business. Send your cute associate up to Ann Arbor to open up his own shop. Go green :)"}
{"text":"The price is a bit high given the size of the sandwiches.  They fill their sandwiches up with shredded cheese trying to make the sandwich look larger than it actually is plus the shredded cheese tastes very bland with the strong meats like salami, ham, etc.  I don't know if its the type of cheese or the shredded texture, but it's not any good.  The lettuce too was shredded (someone really likes using the shredding machine) and totally tasteless, bland tomatoes.  It's summer, why can't these places source better tomatoes this time of year?  Ugghhh."}
{"text":"I don't want to like this place.  It looks as if it was decorated by some aging Boomer who still pours over Rolling Stone and can't seem to grasp the fact that his ponytail no longer looks cool since he went bald, gained 50 lbs and aged 40 years.  Think almost unrecognizable, bad portraits of '60s and '70s rock stars and LOUD classic rock.

But I do like it.  No, scratch that.  I love the place.  Well, not the place, exactly.  The food.  Dave's subs are the best in Cleveland.  There is enough meat, but not too much.  There are plenty of really interesting and well balanced flavors in their signature subs.  The bread and ingredients are very fresh.  The salads are fresh and contain a good amount of healthy, delicious toppings.

And Dave's Cosmic Sauce.  Have mercy.  The sauce is an oil based dressing with a mind blowing combination of herbs, spices, and perhaps cheese?  Who cares, it's delicious.

So I indulge the Boomers their flashback and get take out."}
{"text":"This is a curious little place with really excellent subs. Dave's Cosmic Subs has been franchised to several other locations around town, but the original Dave's is in Chargin Falls, where I go sometimes for lunch. 

You could say that this place has a \"1960's/70's hippie rock theme\", but that would be doing it a cruel injustice. This little shack feels more like an indie record store than a restaurant. It's an explosion of old rock paraphernalia and concert posters, including some glorious old concert photos of the founder Dave himself, in full rock regalia at the microphone in front of dozens, and perhaps even hundreds, of rabid fans. (If there existed any pictures of me in tight white spandex pants circa 1978, they would have been destroyed in a small fire a long time ago. Dave chose to display them at his restaurant. We clearly have different opinions about the aesthetic properties of spandex.) Dave himself is usually present at the Chargin Falls store during lunch hours, brooding behind the counter. He is something of a character. You can just sense his rock 'n' roll frontman ego and charisma still quietly at work. He can be very friendly, or he can be a total wise-ass. (Whatever...it's his store...he can do what he wants.)

I'm not sure what kind of musical talent he was, but Dave certainly has a talent for making some damn fine subs, with high-end ingredients, creative sauces, and these wonderfully hard and crusty sub rolls. The service is lightning fast. There's not much room to eat here except for a pair of cramped, graffiti-riddled seating areas, so plan on taking your sub to go."}
{"text":"Ridiculous employee / manager there!   Threatening and volatile confrontation will occur if you make the mistake of parking in front of the store and using their parking spot incorrectly. My wife was confronted by a large bald man who clearly owns or runs the location. He chewed out my wife in public and tried to force her to by something.  Daves lost my business for life."}
{"text":"Had this quite a bit when I was in Northfield. Never had a bad one.
That said everyone has their favorites and some I didn't enjoy nearly as much as others.

You just have to try what you think would be good, and there is a lot to choose from.

They also have unique pop (or where I live now, soda) flavors. 

The only thing that is garbage is their pickles erhm cucumbers erhm pickles that you get with the sandwhich. A lot of people like them and they even sell them separate there in jars if you want. To me it tastes like a cucumber.

To the garbage reviews. You aren't paying 20 dollars a sub or something insane. You are paying more in line of subway prices and there isn't even a comparison."}
{"text":"Hey! Dave! It was my first time at your Sub shop this past Wednesday. I have one near work and near my home so I finally decided to see what's it all about.

I went to the downtown Cleveland location near work. It has a very hippy, 1960, Beatles, John Lennon, thing going on in there. Is that the theme? I don't care much for the Beatles...Rolling Stones baby!! Whooo....

Anyway, I ate the #17 meatball sub! WOW! It was fantastic, and I'm a man who knows a thing or two about meatball subs! If you haven't yet, check it out, they have tons of soups, sandwiches and salads too! Nice!"}
{"text":"Unique.

That probably is the best description.  I'd keep coming back, because of the eclectic menu and because it's not like other sub/sandwich joints.  Their cosmic sauce is pretty good, and isn't mayonnaise based.  Everything tastes fresh, even though the subs are on the small size for the price.  But hey, you get a pickle with your sub.  Who doesn't like a pickle??

Some guy ordered a sandwich without banana peppers, and my first thought was \"what is wrong with you?\".  Especially so at Dave's where it's the veggie of choice and what's not to love?

Street parking only in downtown Hudson.  Appears to be a lunch spot for people who work in the area.  Decent amount of seating in the place, but the tables could get cleaned more often, at least the day I was in there."}
{"text":"Excellent subs right here in Oberlin!
Dave's make a Philadelphia hoagie-style sub, with fresh hard rolls and a great balance of meats and cheeses The \"cosmic sauce\" featured on many of them is a vinegary Italian-style dressing. I'm partial to the San Francisco but eager to try more varieties. Recommended."}
{"text":"Three major things 1) the music was blaring AND the TV was blaring - not a good atmosphere 2) their credit card machine was not operating correctly and 3) the Dave's Original Sub was just OK - we have had better. Conclusion: go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  Ordered the Dave's original cosmic sub.  Meat very cold and it was placed on the top of the sub leaving only lettuce underneath.  Strange construction.  Not tasty at all."}
{"text":"It's hard to really differentiate sandwiches based on quality but I'm wrong: these are some fantastic sandwiches that will make you forget what a Subway is."}
{"text":"Since I like to try a different place for lunch each day, I found this close enough by to try.
Easy to find, easy to park, easy to order.
Staff friendly and helpful.
Pizza sub was exceptional, but the fresh cut fries were just so - so."}
{"text":"The cosmic sauce, bread and meat are great. I started off eating these subs when I was hungover, now I find myself thinking about eating them all the time. The service is great and always very fast. Probably the best option for lunch downtown. Kind of expensive. It doesn't stop me from eating here."}
{"text":"This place has the best veggie burger in town. I'm not sure what is in it but I crave it when I think of DAVES.  Whatever is in the spicy sauce is amazing. Some locations have fries but not all. This one does for sure so I have to get them ! The store is clean and there isn't a long wait for your fresh sandwich."}
{"text":"I asked the woman at the counter what's good for a vegetarian and she recommended the Garden Burger. It was, indeed, one of the best veggie burgers I have ever had. A little spicy, really unidentifiably tasty good. Though, somehow, I still long for the good old days of Grums..."}
{"text":"there great and original nothing more to say love the place and the environment the people in mentor are always nice that's where i got normally. I'll keep going for sure"}
{"text":"Good bread -- crusty on the outside, soft inside. Plenty of meat (Original Dave's) and lettuce.

Dave's sauce a little overwhelming, and the packing is less than ideal. The meat all ends up folded into a U on the outer edge, the lettuce & sauce piled up inside. I prefer to get a mix of both in each bite.

Wish they'd have sides; all I could see were chips."}
{"text":"So all this talk of Cosmic Brownies on the message board led to me researching who was more cosmic. Was it Little Debbie or Dave? Seeing as how Dave is the heir to the Seaway food fortune(on the website look it up), i had my doubts. I've always seen these places around, but the hippy dippy Janis-Jim Morrison vibe kind of put me off. But they sent me coupons in the mail, and a coupon= purchase. I got a free 8\" sub with the purchase of a regularly priced one. That's $6 worth of free food! The Haight Ashbury looked good, but the name conjured up images of barefoot idiots dancing madly in circles to Ekoostik Hookah at Nelson's Ledges. So i got the Veg Out. It had mushrooms,artichokes, and other veggie delights in a zippy sauce. Highly recommended for vegetarians. I also picked up a Tuna Dave which is your basic tuna sandwich. It was kind of small, but had extra flavor compared to a Subway tuna.

The shop on Detroit is tiny and sort of reminds me of a storefront one would find in a college town like Athens, Columbus or Austin. I dig that. Dude working there had a rock and roll look and a Spitfire Grill trucker hat. I bet his life is way more interesting than mine. Wait, was that sarcasm? I'm not sure anymore.... I also approve of all the psychedelic poster reprints on the walls. They are nice for novices to look at. Myself, being a connoisseur of such artifacts, was not completely floored by the selection.  I may sound snotty, but when you start pillaging the 60's aesthetic to make money, i'm going to be more critical.

So as far as the cosmicness, i don't know. But the sandwich is a better deal than Subway any day."}
{"text":"Very good sub sandwiches and very fresh!! I love stopping in here for lunch or to pick up a quick dinner. They have a great veggie sub which I always get!"}
{"text":"I'm a big Dave's fan but unfortunately this location doesn't seem to hold up to par. I went there last Saturday and got a to-go BLT. When I got home and opened my sub it was missing something very important... the bottom bun. I was hungry enough to eat it anyways but someone definitely needs to be on quality control if this place wants to hold up to the exceptional Dave's standard."}
{"text":"This is the cleanest, nicest Dave's I have been to.  Unlike other Dave's stores, this one is larger, well lit, organized and most importantly CLEAN.   It is located where the old Caribou Coffee used to be in Solon.  I come here often since it is close to me and my family loved the subs. 
 
The staff has always been super nice and accommodating.  I don't think they have ever gotten my order wrong. That's a huge plus for a sub shop.  This location has some stuff that the other Dave's do not.  They have beer and fries.  Which by default makes this the best Dave's sub location of all.  
 
The inside is decorated like the traditional Dave's shops.  There is 60's and 70's rock memorabilia all over the place.  In addition, the music is super loud.  I wish it weren't, but apparently they are not allowed to turn it down.  It's part of the whole \"vibe\" thing.   This location also delivers, which is another bonus.  In my opinion this is the best Dave's in Cleveland.  A must try location."}
{"text":"This is the original classic Dave's location.  It is in a little mini house off Main Street in Downtown Chagrin Falls.   This location is totally GROOVY.  I would not plan to dine in, this location is too loud and too small to accommodate more than a few people.  When I do go here, I carry out and eat near the Chagrin Falls.  It's a great view with a great sandwich. 
 
I usually order the Turkey Dave, although any sub they have is delicious.  Dave's does not have a bad sub.  Also, don't forget the dirty chips to accompany your sub.  They have excellent brownies and cookies.  However, this location does not have beer and fries like the Solon location. 
 
The staff is friendly, and will occasionally address me as,  \"dude.\"  It is so funny to me at my age.  I was never a \"dude\" even when \"dude\" was in fashion.  Either way, they stay true to being groovy.  
 
Hands down this is the best sub in Chagrin Falls.   Plan an afternoon lunch to enjoy the surroundings."}
{"text":"Heard rave reviews and decided to give them a try.  Coming from Chicago, we're looking for some quality go to places.  This is not one of them! I give this 1 star for the initial service.  The young man took my order, made eye contact, smiled and said thank you.  Good Customer Service. It tanked from there. In five minutes my sandwiches were up. They sat there for another 10 minutes as an old man came up to work the front.  He totally ignored my sandwiches and me.  6 people came in after me and were served as they were dining in.  Walking up to the counter to try and get noticed, the old man totally ignored me but made light, friendly conversation with the dining in people standing right next to me.  A young man from the back finally came up and gave me my order.  Subs?  So, so.  The hot subs were cold.  The bread was hard.
I suggest the old man stays in the back of the house as he possesses no social skills whatsoever.  And buy some fresh bread."}
{"text":"I wanted to like it, I really did. The atmosphere is nice but the food let it down. They build the sandwiches wrong. The sauce is on the bottom, then veggies, then meat. This does not work! You cannot get them all together in one bite and the bottom ends up soggy. That is the purpose of a sandwich, food harmony. This was so dissonant I couldn't eat much of it. The sauce is a unique taste, but when you bite the bottom of the sandwich and get mostly sauce, it is gross. Apparently many people like their subs this way due to the success it's had, but I will never eat there again. The worst sub I have ever had."}
{"text":"Great subs! Very creative menu, lots of options, but expensive... I paid $12 for a 12 inch sub and some chips."}
{"text":"Good bread complimented with a great dressing on my \"original\" was music to my taste buds.  Dropped in for lunch the other day and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"After reading reviews and hearing good things from friends, I decided to give Dave's a try. I went to the downtown location on E 6th during mad lunch rush and boy was it busy, which made me think it may really be great!! The people behind the counter, weren't rude which was a plus, but you could tell it was just a systematic \"get orders and get them out\" process - which was fine due to the rush, but I hope they're friendlier when it's slow... 

I ordered the Veg-out and got it cold. The bread was good, but I was NOT impressed by the rest. It was pretty much a shredded cheese sandwich with \"special sauce\" on it. Don't get me wrong, I think of cheese as its own food group, but when I want a sandwich, I want more than cheese. And, the special sauce was pretty much italian dressing in my opinion. Maybe my friends and those who wrote good reviews are basing them off of meaty sandwiches and those may be great, but as far as the veg out goes, not impressed. 

If I go back, I may try the garden burger or pizza sandwich. Neither have the special sauce and hopefully neither come 3/4 full with shredded cheese."}
{"text":"DCS is in a small plaza off Abbe Road, not far from work, so I go here for lunch with coworkers on occasion.  Parking is plentiful and the workers are super friendly.

Dave's has great sammiches and they whip 'em up pretty fast! Not as fast as Jimmy John's down the road, but it's still great! I've never been disappointed by the food.  I've tried about 5 kinds of subs or so and I still can't decide on a favorite!  The Sloppy Dave, Super Dave and The Original Dave's Cosmic Sub are really good though.  Bread is crusty and fresh and toppings are plentiful. You gotta try Dave's Cosmic Sauce on your sub! Great stuff.  Unlike most sammich shops, DCS only offers shredded cheese, so eating can be a bit messy sometimes. They have a nice variety of kettle chips and cookies to pick from and they have fountain pop and bottled beer for drinks.

The classic rock hippie decor and groovy music is a nice touch.  The dining room is on the small side, you can still usually find a table at lunch time. Groovy!"}
{"text":"AWFUL.  Staff is rude and disrespectful. Their sammies aren't even good. I shutter at the thought of ever going near that place."}
{"text":"Good place for subs it adds a different virety than that of subway it's been awhile since I've been here but it's totally  worth a drive over for something different."}
{"text":"We walked in at 8:56pm and I wasn't expecting to be served with a closing time of 9pm. Not only did the proprietor serve us, we chatted for several minuets before we ordered and after we received our food.  During our chat, we discussed the business, history of the chain, and were made to feel welcome. 

The food was awesome!! We ordered a #1 and #7. It was so good.  Will be back for sure."}
