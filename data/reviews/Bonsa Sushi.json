{"text":"A quick meal place.  Either soup or sushi is too salty to my taste.  But they are well made."}
{"text":"If I could, I would give it 4.5 stars. Ordered some take out for the first time today and I will definitely be back. The fish is absolutely delicious. Lots of flavor and tastes very fresh. The sushi was very well made (didn't fall apart in my hand). The ambiance is pretty low key. Prices are pretty good. Looking forward to my next trip back!"}
{"text":"Every neighbourhood needs a solid go to sushi place. You know it's not the best, but it's dependable, well priced and always good. Bonsai happens to be mine.   They have good deals on chef special platters, we typically take the 44 pieces for $40, which is cheap for this area of town. They also have good lunch specials ranging around $9-$12.  The quality is okay, and the fish consistently tastes fresh.   I wouldn't make a special trip just for this place, but if you're in the hood, it's a good bet."}
{"text":"I stumbled into this cute little restaurant last week with a friend following a gruelling weight lifting session and despite being extremely skeptical of what was to come, I think I may have discovered one of the best secret sushi places in town!!!  It was late on a Thursday night and everything in the area was closed or closing within the hour. We decided we wanted sushi and so after finding this place on Yelp, and seeing the high ratings, we decided to try it out. When looking for it from the street, it's easy to miss the restaurant. Without any big flashy signs or anything, we really had to focus on the name/address of the restaurant to locate it. Upon entering we were warmly greeted by the owner, and were seated at one of the 5-6 tables avilable.   We were given the menus, and proceeded to order a variety of rolls not really expecting much. When my green salad came out, we were already impressed by the portion size and the dressing which was AMAZING. Following, our rolls came out, and we instantly figured that we would need to order more, but we couldn't have been more wrong!  I had some salmon sashimi, the tuna kamikaze roll (PHENOMENAL), an avocado roll, and a special roll with salmon and green apple (YUMMM). Everything on my plate as well as my friends' was spot on and was made generously with fresh ingredients. If we weren't so full we definitely would have ordered more.  When we were done, we stayed to chat for a while before finally asking the owner what time they closed. She told us not to worry and to stay as long as we wanted but that they usually closed 45 minutes BEFORE we asked!! Needless to say, the attitude and hospitality here are outstanding.  All this added to the fact that the bill came out to only $30 with tax and tip, and you'll quickly notice that it doesn't really get better than that.  I cannot wait to go back and bring everyone I know!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite sushi spot in the plateau. Try the spicy salmon, BBQ eel maki, vege-patate, and mini kamikaze and you will not be disappointed! The chefs spicy mayo is on point,  which is the litmus test for a good sushi restaurant IMHO"}
{"text":"La deuxième fois qu'on s'est fait livré on avait un ami donc on a pris un plus gros plateau. C'était bon mais on a eu l'impression de manger toujours le même morceau. Les 4 hosomakis semblaient tous identiques c'était un peu moyen du coup Dommage"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi de quartier, le staff est gentil et attentif.   My go-to after a long day, when I have nothing to eat at home or no energy to cook."}
{"text":"This is a really awesome little sushi restaurant. Great prices, excellent food. Always fresh. Friendly staff! What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Pas le meilleur sushi que j'ai goûté mais pour se faire livrer et manger sur le pouce c'est pas mal, bon et frais. C'est des classiques non originaux"}
{"text":"Honestly I love this place. The fish is always fresh, the rice is never overdone... So fresh it melts in your mouth. Not to mention the staff is always super friendly. Love this place. And the price is perfect too"}
{"text":"Very good sushi, it is fresh, they stuff a generous amount of fish in each roll. They were very accomodating, making everything gluten free since i am celiac. I didn't know you can remove the tempura on soft shell crab which was my favourite rolls before i got diagnozed, there the only place that agreed to do it. Will be back often."}
{"text":"Great value for the money, sushi is fresh (enough), rice is good and service is great!"}
