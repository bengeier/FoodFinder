{"text":"Location: It can be difficult to find this restaurant if you are not familiar with the area. It is on the 2nd floor of Asian Town Center. Once inside, the restaurant is small, clean and inviting. I just noticed they opened another area separate from the restaurant for large groups/parties, which has a karaoke set up. 

Service: The staff are usually very nice. At my last visit, they even offered to replace our meal if we were not satisfied. The door bell on the table is also nice to have, but can attract attention from everyone in the restaurant if used. 

Food: Not bad.
- Pros: Usually I order my usual S15 Bi Bim Bap when I come. Very filling! The crunchy rice from the sizzling hot pot is my favorite!!  My BF ordered the mackerel, which was overall fresh and pretty well priced. It even came with a seafood soy paste soup.
- Cons:  The small dishes offered fluctuate in quality and quantity. At my last visit, we only were given 6 dishes, we usually get at least 8. One dish was not even edible bc of how spicy it was. I was also disappointed that they did not have tea automatically served for you. You have to ask, or you just get water. The Korean rice tea is one of the joys of Korean dining. 

Overall: I would come back when craving late night Korean food. Not a lot of options for Korean food in Cleveland, so having Meiga open until 10 is convenient. Seoul Garden on the west side is still my favorite!"}
{"text":"Went last night (Friday @ 6:30pm). Was pretty quiet and service was fast and good. I have been here about 7 times and this was my first dinner.  I was pleasantly surprised that I could have a fast, quiet meal on a Friday evening. A hidden gem.  I also frequent Seoul Garden in Parma but this place has better pan seared spicy squid with vegetables hands down. Also the price is a little lower for a lot of the dishes i enjoy. Also the pan fried mackerel is more authentic and less greasy. If you love Korean style Jajang myun and jampong, this place makes them pretty authentic. I can't find it like this even in Dallas, TX. 

Overall,  I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've only been to a couple of Korean BBQ spots and so far this the one I enjoyed the most.  The service can be a little better if they had more workers.  Overall it was okay."}
{"text":"First, there are \"bells\" on each table that you press when you want a waiter to come to your table. Otherwise they will NOT come and bother you. There is no such thing as slow service, only you not being smart enough to press the button.
   We had a great young man from Korea waiting on us this day. The restaurant wasn't full but he seemed to be the only once working the room and was very busy. He seemed to be very flabbergasted when I spoke what little Korean I knew. My wife, not so much. LOL.

   I won't bother describing the food. You either know it or you don't. Go look it up on youtube or something. BUT, it was good and the service was great and the place was clean."}
{"text":"This spot definitely has *better Korean food than other places in Cle. But by no means an authentic experience.  Satisfying for a quick Korean food fix though!"}
{"text":"Food is downright dammed tasty. Pan chans could use a pick me up. But the Sam Google Sal is perfect, and one of the best Twaeng Chan Chi-gees I've hard since living in korean. Prices are crazy affordable for a US based Korean BBQ joint. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If I could give them 0 stars I would. The service was very rude. We were reminded constantly that they close at 9:30 even though it wasn't 9:30 yet. We came in around 8:30 and a reservation was made ahead of time, and they had to ask the manager is it was alright if we could be seated (@ 8:40). We ordered quickly hence they seemed upset. (@ 9:25) they told us they were closing in 3 minutes so we quickly left. Tip was left under the bowl but it was overlooked so the lady only saw 7 cents, which was our change when we paid our bill. We quickly left and the lady ran after us screaming saying \"you can have your 7 cents back!\" This was very rude and unprofessional. The food was made in a rush and did not taste as great. I will never recommend this place to anyone else, and I will never step foot back into this place again!"}
{"text":"This place used to be very good but now I get very disappointed with their service. The waiter was not very responsive and messed up the order of serving dishes. It took us quite a long time until we finish the check. They even included the tip in the meal before we gave the credit cards. The food was not bad but I'm not sure if I will pay for their service anymore."}
{"text":"this restaurant is up and down too much (possibly they change chef frequently)

had sam gyup sal bbq there (wasn't fresh enough (meat) and verity enough (vegetable warping stuff) ) was disappointed they do not have the table grill but have something like camping burner

and i got recommended to order jjambong? (spicy seafood noodle soup) I was like \"this was the food what I was looking for\" and suddenly, they are serving totally different food now it is really bad (I think different chef?)

I gave them some chances and I would never go there again to try"}
{"text":"Their bi bim bop is the best in the county. Either in the hot stone or cold bowl, it's the best."}
{"text":"The mall is still not full with vendors and is still under renovation. What has been done so far is pretty nice. The grocery is large, well organized and stocked, and clean (it doesn't smell terrible like other grocers in the area). The building has large open spaces and inadequate heating, so it's pretty chilly in winter.  The restaurant is attractively decorated and seems clean.  With only one other Korean restaurant in NYC I tried that I can compare this one to, I was moderately pleased with the food and service. 

The servers were efficient taking orders, but they could be a little more attentive with follow up and explaining options.  No dessert was offered, so I don't know if they even have any.  Don't expect the professionalism you'd find in finer establishments. 

The food was mostly tasty, but often overcooked. I tasted someone's breaded and fried pork and found the breading too thick and the meat chewy.  I had the dol sot bi bim bob, which I had in NYC previously.  I loved it in NY, but here it's pretty dull and short on flavor, and the meat is meager. This was the opinion of others in my party who had this dish. Even before the meat was burned and stuck to the bowl, it was overcooked.  I also tried the octopus, some of which was tender, but some was so chewy as to be almost inedible. The green tea was terrible too, smelling and tasting like rice that had started to go bad.  I'm told someone's terriyaki dish was quite good.

So although I would try this place again, I hope the owners take the critiques of the food on Yelp to heart."}
{"text":"On Sunday they are supposedly opened until 9:30 but when we called they said they closed at 9 because they were busy. So we politely asked if its okay if we made a reservation at 8:30, and they said sure. So when we got there they had to go ask the boss if we could be seated. After she said asked we got seated. After we got seated we got constantly reminded that they close at 9:30. The service was alright after we ordered and gotten our food, but then around 9:25 they handed us bill and asked us if we could pay first so that they can settle the computer which I'm fine with. I understand that they just want to close and go home. So we paid first and we continued eating until 9:25, which we were once reminded again that they closed in 5 minutes. So we finished up eating, left a tip, and then left. Right as we walked out the door one of the workers walked out and rudely said \"YOU CAN KEEP YOUR SEVEN CENTS.\" First of all, we left a six dollar tip for them. Secondly, I'm upset and angry at how we were treated. We were rushed and rudely treated. If I had a choice I would rate this no stars for their rude service."}
{"text":"Excellent Korean. Had the Dak Bulgoki. Very comprehensive menu. Can do the barbecue at the table if that is your thing."}
{"text":"Why are all the asian restaurants hidden away in some secret asian plaza? Even with the assistance of GPS, we had a hard time finding this place and thought it was closed. Luckily, we persisted and were rewarded with delicious hot korean food. Being in Cleveland, it is extremely hard to find diversity in terms of food, and basically everything. I'm glad we finally tried this place, as I'll definitely be back. 
We ordered their hot pot with assorted meats which was soooo huge and soo filling. Even after three of us stuffed our faces, the pot looked like it was still completely full. Yay for leftovers!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere! We had the bbq spare ribs and chicken and noodle soup. Both delicious. I highly recommend this place and the ribs!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. 6 of us went for the first time. We let Julia pick our meal and she did a phenomenal job. Everything was delicious. Can't recommend it highly enough."}
{"text":"This place is awesome... if you are looking for a relaxed spot to chill with friends and great food... this is the spot. Cooking on the table is fun. If you are unsure about what to order go for the Gal Bi... you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Their food is fine but when we get the bill there is 18% pre-tip already added in. And they around up the number to $150 in total. We are wonder is it legally? 
Today is my boyfriend's birthday and it makes us very uncomfortable... This is the first time I write something in this place because I think they have a bad business practice!"}
{"text":"Will never go back after our experience tonight.  Everything says they're open until 10:00pm, but when we got there at 8:45 we were told that we had to order before 9:00pm because the chef leaves at 9:00.  So, why don't you state that you close at 9pm?  Banchan was old and stale and only received 3 dishes when we normally receive much more.  Asked for water 3 times and never received any.  Asked for Bori Cha and we were told that they didn't have any.  Terrible service.  Food tasted terrible tonight.  We are normally treated very well at this restaurant and the food is usually delicious, but we didn't even receive a goodbye or thank you from the owner when we left.  If this is how you treat people who drive from Columbus for your food, then we will find another restaurant who appreciates the business.   If you're irritated that people come in so close to closing time, then you should advertise that you close at 9pm and not 10pm.  If you're looking for good Korean food with friendly service, go ANYWHERE but Miega."}
{"text":"I was hoping this place would be delish since it smelled good. Unfortunately we were pretty disappointed. The side dishes were very bland. The Bulgogi wasn't cooked well - the meat was grey and very under seasoned. Not good at all. We also ordered a spicy squid dish and it tasted decent but nothing special to be honest. We won't likely be back. The service is pleasant and friendly but the food was very lackluster. We really hoped for better food ESP considering there were several Korean patrons. Oh well.... Back to Ha Anh for us!"}
{"text":"The best thing about my visits to Miega is the service-- you can tell the owners care about making quality food. A friend of mine mentioned in passing that her kimchi fried rice was not seasoned enough, and the owner/manager visited the table to personally ask if the dish could be improved in some way. The three dishes I have tried-- dol sot bi bin ba (make sure to get the dol sot version, because it comes in the hot stone bowl!) , a fried octopus dish, and hearty stew-- were all as tasty as you could ask for. Miega also has a karaoke room, which you can request for free! Tasty food, great service, and free karaoke-- I'd give it 4.5/5."}
{"text":"Since this place opened up several years ago, it's become the place to go for Korean food (and karaoke) in Cleveland, and it's easy to see why:

- They've got a nice big selection of stuff on their menu, from haemul pajeon (seafood pancakes) to at least 3 types of jigae, and I have not found anything yet which I disliked. Of course, the bibim bop is tasty. They even have grilled whole fish. Yum!
- Good variety of banchan (side dishes)
- Prices are quite good for lunch. For dinner you do stay in the 2-dollar sign range. 
- The service people are always nice. And there are buttons you can press at the table if you feel bad about flagging down the servers.
- Karaoke is free with dinner, and there is a fancy separate room away from the rest of the restaurant to insulate your belting friends from the other diners. 
- Splitting checks is easy and hassle free.


Of course there are things to be aware of:

- Waiting times for food and service (after you have been seated at the table) can get very, very long at peak hours. Over an hour at times. This has gotten better since they hired more staff.
- There should be at least 10 people in your party if you want the karaoke room. You should reserve it in advance. And if the restaurant is closing early, you may be asked to finish your singing early.
- The karaoke room is fancy but selection is limited by the less-than-up-to-date books. You punch in numbers for the songs you want, but sometimes the books have missing pages, and there doesn't seem to be another way to search for the songs you want.

Overall, it's a solid Korean restaurant with a wide selection of well cooked dishes, and my first choice for Korean food in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Ok. This time, I went around 3:30PM, which is probably the least busy hour. 
It was. Apparently the waiters we encountered before were only there if it's busy. 
Imagine that. 

Anyways, the service was greatly improved obviously, since there were only 3 parties including us at the restaurant. Neat! 
The lady (I'm assuming she's one of the owners) even asked what sort of Korean show I wanted to watch :P 

So.. why still 3 stars? This time, I'm just being very critical of the food. 
Last time, the AWESOME food made up for the sub-par service. This time, the service made up for the sub-par food. 
I guess I was expecting a lot given my past experience.. 

We ordered  steamed dumplings, Jjamppong, which is a spicy seafood noodle soup dish, and tang-soo-yook (sweet and sour pork). 

First off, the dumplings were probably some of the best I've had. They make it fresh, all hand made and lucky for us, they actually made them that day. It was just awesome. Everything a dumpling should be :) 

For the jjamppong, I was quite disappointed to see how not spicy it was. It had a LOT of seafood in it which was really nice, but the broth was really missing in its spiciness. Where was the kick I experienced with the ddeokbokki? The noodles could be more chewy, as they seemed a bit too soft to be used for that particular dish. Perhaps I can ask them to make it spicier? But seriously, I'm not that good at eating spicy things yet I could not feel anything spicy-wise at all. :/ Bummer-. 

On to the sweet and sour pork. Well...this... I mean.. The dish looked really good. It had all the elements of a good sweet and sour pork (a bit on the Korean-Chinese food style).. But the pork smelled. Quite a bit. The pieces of meat was quite big and it could have been awesome aside from the smell. I'm not that sensitive to meat smells so if it was to a degree that I could smell it, I'm really not sure how other more sensitive people might have felt eating that dish. 
The tempura coating became soggy within a few minutes, which you really don't expect on a sweet and sour dish. It should have stayed crunchy for at least the length of the time we were dining, which was around 30 minutes or so. 
Major turn off there too. The sweet and sour sauce itself was way way too sweet, so at the end, it was a hunk of smelly pork covered in soggy tempura coating in a sickeningly sweet sauce. 
Seriously, will probably not order again. :/

So... All in all, I'll definitely return to Miega for the dumplings, ddeokbokki and pa-jun. I did make it my goal to at least try most of their dishes, so we'll see how that goes. 

I do wish some of the dishes cost a bit less..but... well, I guess Korean restaurants are on the scarce side.. 

Miega, we shall see you again soon.!"}
{"text":"Their server is impatient and rude when I want to change a new baking tray. 
And first several times I can't post this review because this is a short side. But if I can't post it who will know their bad attitude?"}
{"text":"I used to think that Cleveland didn't have any Korean food; however, I finally found a place with some good food! It's not as delicious as those NYC Korean restaurants, but the menu is definitely authentic and they have a very good selection of dishes."}
{"text":"The restroom and floor in the corner where we sat had evidence of mouse poop!  We didn't get what we ordered.  What we got was good!  The hostess took our menu before we placed the order...They seemed preoccupied with the large table of 15 and could care less about the rest of us.  We had tlo get up to get more water."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and was amazed by the amount of food for the price! You will never leave here hungry. The lunch box I got was perfect. The steak was tender and could tell that all the food was fresh and of good quality. I was very impressed and plan on making this a common lunch stop. Thanks to everyone over at Miega!"}
{"text":"Been here two times and both experiences were similar... bad service and mediocre food.

The first visit I was satisfied with the food, but the service sucked badly. I know the place is owned by an immigrant family, and service in some asian(also Europe) countries is not expected to be at the level of the US. But with that said, I have traveled in the Philippines, Korea, Thailand, UK, mainland Europe, Japan, etc., and never experienced service this pathetic. When you get the waiter to your table, order everything because you aint seeing him again until you get the bill. I should mention, both times I had to go to the counter to ask for the bill despite ringing the bell on the table several times.

The second visit was the clincher. My wife ordered the bbq, where they bring the grill to the table and you cook it yourself. One of the staff had the nerve to come over and turn off the grill because the party behind us complained. Firstly, don't have the bbq if your ventilation sucks. Second, don't expect that passive display of disrespect to dissuade a guy like me... I cranked it back up and cooked that shit well done. It was either that or walk out without paying... which was an option. Never again will I go to this dump. My wife likes the market downstairs and that is as close as we will get to miega henceforth."}
{"text":"Love this place. They bring out about 12 little appetizer plates with various spiced veggies. The tea is good and the food is phenomenal. I got the spicy seafood-tofu stew this time and my husband gets the sizzling pork platter each time. Very fulfilling and such a great meal for the price. This place is also BYOB, which is great.  The parking lot and building looks a bit shady, but the inside building is actually not bad, with various small Studios and food places."}
{"text":"good food. cheaper than several other Korean restaurants in the area. good service and friendly. still not the same as Korean cuisine in more Korean dense areas.... but it definitely beats Seoul Garden on price, service and taste."}
{"text":"Taste: 4/10 
Cleanliness: 8/10
Service: 5/10
Price: 5/10 

Overall, the service was mediocre like the food. I have been to many Korean restaurants and this one is by far the lowest quality restaurants I've been to. The food is overpriced for the taste. Portion size is average. Side dishes are very average as well. 

I got the  Dol-Sot Bibimbap - Stone Mixed Rice Bowl, which was mediocre. 
 My mom got the spicy marinade squid, which was 1/10. It had barely any taste and barely any squid. Just lots of onions!! Pictures may be deceiving."}
{"text":"Cleveland doesn't have a great selection of korean food but Miega is the best we have. The owner is a sweet lady who hand makes the dumplings. The dishes are authentic and delicious. It's tucked away in the quiet corner on the second floor of the Asian town center but the food compensates for the slightly subpar ambience. I always recommend this place to co workers and friends."}
{"text":"I've been to several Korean BBQs in my home state of Florida and I have to say this one is the best I've experienced.

The staff were extremely friendly and attentive. I've often had the stigma of being Caucasians in an Asian restaurant and not being experts on the cuisine and either getting poor quality help due to language barriers or poor quality help due to being an outsider. Here the staff was friendly, well-spoken, and knew exactly how to help some Caucasians that didn't quite know what they wanted.

Our waitress suggested a seafood noodle soup that she assured us would be excellent for leftovers, and I knew I wanted some good beef so I opted for the ribeye to grill at the table. The soup was loaded with noodles, vegetables, and tons of whole shrimp, mussels, and squid all cooked perfectly.

The BBQ came out on a nice flat skillet with a small portable propane grill underneath. The ribeye was extremely tendered and well flavored, served with a raw onion to grill alongside and the traditional banchan. Every single one, from the fish cakes to the eggplant, were tasty and just the right bit to accompany our meat. Fresh romaine and a bowl of rice came as usual, but the kicker was a miso-broth based soup that I have no idea what was in it aside from tofu but it was delicious and an unexpected star of the meal.

All of that was under $40 and gave us 2 days worth of leftovers. The restaurant was clean and inviting and the menu had plenty on it to make it worth coming back. The only complaint I can say is that it's a bit difficult to find, being on the 2nd floor of the Asian Town Center. But now that I know where it is, I'll definitely go back if I'm ever in the area again!"}
{"text":"It really pains me to give this place one star.

I used to come here pretty often since I liked their dolsot bibimbap. But it was all undone. It was a cloudy day, so I figured some soup was in order. I got the dumpling and rice cake soup. Here were the problems.

1. Half the dumplings were split open and the filling was floating around in the soup. I tried to pick up the other half (which appeared intact), and whether it was with chopsticks or spoon, it'd fall apart as well. Clearly, these were way overcooked. Despite at times, forgetting that I left the stove on, I've never managed to overcook my dumplings, so this is pretty impressive feat.

2. There was no rice cake. I explained to the server that my dish came with rice cakes. She and I argued for a couple minutes. I pointed it out on the menu that it did and this ended all debate. A few minutes later, she came out with a small bowl of plain boiled rice cakes, which I added to my soup. 

3. Towards the end of the meal, I saw something floating in my soup. A piece of saran wrap plastic about 1x1 cm (0.4x0.4 inches, for you imperialists). I pulled it out and my friend said yep, it's plastic. This was the straw that broke the camel's back, and hence why I feel extra compelled to write this review.

I'm definitely not coming back. The food, service and cleanliness is just way too questionable for me to tolerate."}
{"text":"Im going to start by saying i love Korean BBQ. The food here was great and an awesome time to  be able to socialize with friends while eating. Youll find the average price you will spend here is somewhere between 20$ and 25$ per person. Its only upsetting when you realize people usually pay about 25$ for all you can eat. The veggies are unlimited but other than that you wont get that here in cleveland. Im also used to getting a free egg or two with the meal. None the less the food is good."}
{"text":"I do like the little appetizers they provide before dinner. those appetizers are worth 4 stars themselves. 

Food wise, I'd only give it a 3.5 overall. If you order the right dishes, it's a 4 star, otherwise, it's really just a 3. So choose wisely.

I would NOT suggest the dumpling soup with rice cake dish. Even though I actually liked their frozen dumplings, it wasn't even fully cooked when they brought it out. It was fine after we soaked it in the soup for a while, but that was not the most pleasant experience when you want some nice warm soup. Also, their hotpot combo dish isn't the best in the world. We got the one with beef, ham, and veggies. It's the cheapest combo, and you can tell they do also provide you with the cheapest quality of meat. Chewy beef and spam, not exactly what I had in mind just reading their descriptions.

However, they do a very nice job with the pork bellies. It came out sliced really thin. (4 stars for the thin slices) I hope you know how to cook them yourself because they seem to have a shortage of staff members to help you cook sometimes. 

Would I go back again? Yes because it's close to me and it has good appetizers. I'd go back for some more pork bellies too. But if I had other options, I'd choose other places to go instead."}
{"text":"I was reallllly excited to try Miega with some friends. We are on a quest to find good Korean food in Cleveland.

Miega is located on the 2nd floor of the new Asia Town Center. It's a cool space and I'm glad there are some small businesses there! Miega is the lone business. The inside has an updated look with warm colors. 

We got there fairly early (5pm) and there were a few people, but more people came in through the night (5-6 more tables?) It definitely has the feel of a restaurant that's just starting out.

I ordered the dolsot galbi bi bim bap, which is rice, vegetables and beef short ribs in a sizzling stone pot. The rice got REALLY crispy, which was amazing! Mmm. The galbi was ok. I think it wasn't as soft as it could have been and the cut seemed a little thick. I also tried the kimchi jigae. I'm more sensitive to spiciness, but my friends said it was a little tame for the spicy ones they've had in the past.

I guess the reason Miega is a 3 is because we are still on a quest for really good MEAT. As my bf says...no one does meat better than Koreans! 

Also - do not be mislead. There are no BBQ grills on the table here. They do have LA Korean BBQ that you can order though. (I just learned about what LA BBQ is! Basically, it's Korean American bbq v. the kind you would find in Korea.)

Banchan was good - they gave us 8 little dishes/appetizers. They were pretty decent. I thought we'd be able to finish them all, but we couldn't by the end of the meal..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is incredible. I came here once with my friend who told me about it and I was shocked. The food is incredible and cooked perfectly and the service is outstanding. Definitely recommend coming to this place. I'll be here a lot more often! The food and dishes served are just perfect."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic Korean restaurant, this is not the place. But the food here is still pretty good! Some items I've tried include jap chae, dokboki, galbi. and seafood pancake. The first three items are a lot sweeter than the same dishes I've tried in other places. I still recommend them though! The seafood pancake is a must! At about $7, the pancake is really filling and has a ton of seafood in it! 
If you have a large group coming, you can reserve the room down the hall from the main restaurant! That room has a pretty swanky karaoke machine with music from all genres and different Asian countries!"}
{"text":"What did we ordered for three people 
B5 
K8   Seafood 
S16 have mu idol sot bi bim bob

Good, awesome ,"}
{"text":"Second time at Miega.

Very clean.
Comfortable seating.
The service bell on the table is mute as the wait staff is keenly on standby.

There seems to be a bit of a language barrier for some of the wait staff  - just be patient.

The fried dumplings were amazing. I got the seafood pancake appetizer - good but a tad greasy (not sure if that is how it is to be served as I am not an experienced Korean dinner).

I will be returning.  I would especially like to go with a bigger group of people and a bigger appetite.  The BBQ at the other tables looked like a fun way to experience Korean."}
{"text":"I haven't had Korean food in forever and I had to check this place out. This is the closest I can to my grandma's cooking. Their LA style BBQ was to die for. It was perfectly marinated and marbled with fat."}
{"text":"Very nice lunch. I think this place will catch on. Love the sides. Waitress very friendly. 
Got enough food for three."}
{"text":"Talk about a best kept secret! Trying to find this place was like searching for public Wi-Fi in North Korea! Contrary to the misleading address  listing on Google, the restaurant itself is actually located on the second floor of a rather inconspicuous building on East 38th Street off Superior Ave, one that any normal person would easily drive past 50 times and mistaken for an ordinary office building. 

Once you walk through the front entrance, you have to ascend a set of stairs which take you to a second floor shopping area featuring various Asian shops... before finally reaching Miega! Relieved, I sat down and looked over the menu before deciding on my Korean favorite - Bimibop without meat! Korean food is a tantalizing culinary experience that will erase any misperceptions you've ever had with respect to Asian food as a whole. What a fantastic meal it was, perfectly cooked and exploding with flavor, not to mention the friendly and attentive service!

Think of Miega as a dream girl, it might be hard to find, but once you do you don't ever want to let it go! I will be back soon, and this time I won't need GPS!!"}
{"text":"I've noticed one thing about Asian food in Cleveland is that a lot of places group Asian food all together in their restaurants. It says Korean, but they offered some Chinese food as well. Anyways I don't mind because I LOVE ALL ASIAN food you know being half Chinese and growing up in SF and all.

 I had the spicy pork from the lunch menu. It was $10 for SO MUCH FOOD. Not too many places in San Francisco can you get that much food for $10. The service was good and the food was great. Definitely check this place out if you're in Asian Town. (It's on the top floor near the dojo)"}
{"text":"Can barely understand how a restaurant I used to like turns into so ridiculous! Service is definitely rude, the server put the plates bluntly, and responded to us very inactively. The food? Just acceptable, which no better than ANY OTHER Korean restaurants, so why don't we just go another place??"}
{"text":"I think most important thing is to have good servers for restaurants.
After going here twice and having bad experiences both times, it's hard to recommend this place to anyone and the food definitely doesn't compensate..
Seoul Garden at Parma still rocks this place, although Korean food in Northeast Ohio  overall is not the best.."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend on a weekday and lucky they close later than 9 because none of the other Korean places were still open. Anyhow this place just opened not too long ago and the place is pretty much decked out. Great traditional door that can found in the Korea houses used mainly as their exit door. Each table has a bell service option which I find awesome and rare in Cleveland. So anytime you need something, just ring the bell and someone would come attend you. 

On to the food, this place has a great selection to choose from. From your traditional appetizers such as Korean dumplings and Ddukkbokki, they also had a Chinese-Korean dishes like Jjangmyun that I like so much and Korean BBQ! This place has it all and the prices were a bit pricey but the portions were plentiful. We ordered their ddukbokki and tried it for the first time. I was disappointed due to the lack of taste. In other words, it was mainly all of the rice cakes in a pool of tasteless red chili paste. It wasn't hot enough and maybe I have a standard from eating from Seoul but I was not a big fan of their version whatsoever. There were fish cakes, onions in the dish but when it comes to Korean food, the chili paste is everything. For the main entree, I ordered their jjangmyun and this was exceptionally tasteful. The pork was tender and the black bean sauce was great. 

I'd have to come back to try their BBQ!"}
{"text":"I spent a month on a med school rotation that brought me to this neighborhood of Cleveland.  I'm glad I did, because I probably wouldn't really have found out about the area otherwise, and Miega was one of the highlights.

I'm far from an expert on Korean food, but I had a really good experience both times I tried out Miega!  The first time, I tried out the lunch Bi Bim Bop, and really enjoyed it.  Oddly enough, I thought the beef could have had a bit more flavor, but when you mixed it with the rice, veggies and egg it tasted great.  On my second visit, I tried the lunch combo of \"ae uk bok um\", which was a delicious spicy pork with a ridiculous amount of sides.  The pork was excellent, and did not hold back on the heat.  I really liked all of the sides, especially the fried postickers, cold noodles, and a few off the vegetable small plates.  For $12, this was a huge and delicious meal at a great price.

The Asia Town Center doesn't have much curb appeal, and it doesn't really get better once you get inside, but don't let that deter you.  Come inside, make your way upstairs and have a great meal."}
{"text":"Most Korean places in Cleveland are subpar. This one was no exception. I went with a friend and we ordered bibimbap, bulgogi, and mandu soup. The bibimbap was good but nothing special that you couldn't get at any other Korean restaurant in the area or make it yourself. The bulgogi was terrible. I am not sure if they were out of meat that day or think non-Koreans can't tell the difference between real beef and CHICKEN LIVER because that's what it tasted like. I have eaten a lot of bulgogi and know that it's not supposed to taste like cat food mixed with marinated cardboard with Korean seasoning. I am not exactly sure what I ate but it was definitely not beef. However, The Mandu soup was the best part of the meal as it was bursting with flavorful and the mandu were delicious and the reason I am not giving this place a 1 star."}
{"text":"I came here on a not so busy Friday night but service was a bit slow. We got seated immediately but wasn't given water or the menus until 10 minutes later.
Anyhow, we made our selections fairly quickly. My girlfriend and I ordered the S6 (kimchi jji gae), S8 (soon du bu jji gae) and K11 (jae yuk du boo kimchi). However the server returned and we were told they were out of materials for the kimichi jji gae so we switched to S7 (doen jang jji gae). 

The food arrived fairly quickly and came with about 10 ban chan dishes. But sadly there wasn't any steamed eggs this time (which was included 2 years ago). The soup dishes arrived piping hot and was served in a hot clay bowl. The spicy broth was pretty flavorful with good consistency. My dish had bits of seafood like octopus, clams, and shrimp. The seafood wasn't overcooked or too chewy. The K11 dish arrived a bit later. It's basically a spicy marinated pork and kimchi dish served with steamed/boil tofu triangles. The pork was had great flavor and the tofu went well with the dish. It also help calm the spiciness of the dish. 

We both managed to finish our soup dishes but we barely ate 1/4 of the K11 dish. The portions was generous enough for us to have it for lunch the next day. 

Be aware that this place serves Korean BBQ, so it does get smoky and the smell may stick onto your clothing for some time."}
{"text":"ok, so feeling a little more merciful today  (like my role model, Commodus -- \"AM I NOT MERCIFUL?\"), i decided to give Miega another shot.  due to my odor control issues, i went alone this time.

so going solo to a Korean restaurant, one always wonders if they'll cheap out on the panchan-- and not only did they not do that, but the panchan was far improved from the last time around.  (do these restaurant owners actually read these yelp reviews or something???)

so yea-- instead of the 4 lame-os i got last time, this time they gave me 8, including the cool fluffly Korean poached egg thingy.  (Koreans, forgive me for totally disrespecting that marvelous dish;  i have no idea what it's called.)

so yea-- they were just courteous and attentive and gave me all the cool frills, even though i was a party of one.

the dol sot bi bim bap was also, dare i say it-- perhaps even slightly better than the other ones i've tried in Cleveland.

so-- upgrade.  4 stars.

AM I NOT MERCIFUL???"}
{"text":"I returned to Miega and fortunate for me. Never in all my many decades on this earth had I a better server. She brought me a salad, many varieties of banchan, a fork, some soup, and smiled as I asked to move far from the table with two young women and an abundance of unruly kids. The word to describe this young woman has yet to be invented. Had I just returned from Afghanistan after ten years, me own grandmum could not have made me more welcome at her kitchen table. 

Years ago cousin Kathleen met me at the Honolulu airport with a plumeria lei. She rushed me to her favorite Korean restaurant and ordered bi bim bap.  I had no desire for rice again for months and no longing for bi bim bap ever again. But because Miega's prices are steep I thought I would order one of the less costly bi bim baps. I forgive you Kathleen, it is a good dish. 

Just goes to show no matter what you have seen, some one can come along and show you better. Thanks Miss Wonderful Server."}
{"text":"Everything we've had has been excellent. They have an extensive menu, including some non-Korean items. Definitely among the best in the area."}
{"text":"We went here a months ago, food was good and staff were awesome. And we are actually on our way to go eat there right now all the way from Erie. I don't mind spend 2 hours driving to eat their food"}
{"text":"Good food but I am not OK with businesses manipulating Yelp for their profit.

From their website:

\"25% off Coupon will be available for those who reviewed at Yelp.com with 5 stars as appreciate sharing great experience with MiegaBBQ.\"

So 4 stars for food and -3 stars for that. Be wary of recent 5 star reviews. 4 star reviews get nothing."}
{"text":"Excellent food, awesome grilling at the table, extremely friendly staff! This gem is tucked away on the second floor of a shopping center, so it's easy to miss. If you order the food make sure you do the back page of the menu and get the ribs. Trust me, this is the route to go."}
{"text":"Korean food here is better than most of what I've had back in my country. But do not recommend BBQ. Noodles soup and rice is much better!"}
{"text":"Great food (had the dolsot bibimbap for lunch) and side dishes of course. Not a gourmand but like Korean food/tastiness - last eaten alot in my hometown of Houston.  Location a little out of the way for a newbie like me and also one server/hostess during lunchtime, though she was able to bring food out and attend promptly.
Edit: Ate here again, hostess still very quick and attentive,  so upgraded rating.   Also has unlimited sides (and rice) \"if you eat a meal here\"...!"}
{"text":"This place has really great food, love the atmosphere. You can cook the meat yourself at your table, sort of like hibachi / fondue would work. The food was really flavorful, had a great time!"}
{"text":"Sigh. I heard Miega gamed it's fame when it had a booth at the Cleveland Asian Festival and was asked to start a restaurant. Because of that, I was really excited about their food. Sad to admit, it's not that authentic and Seoul Garden out in Parma is still way better.

Pros: good amount of good, nice variety of sides
Cons: not authentic enough, their food is a bit on the sweet side (specially the apChae), service was slow. 

Side dishes-- my favorite part of Korean restaurants are always the sides. Miega has one of the better variety of side dishes in Cleveland. Sadly, it's still not as good and as much as Seoul Garden's. And, if my friend and I didn't ask for their steamed egg side dish, they wouldn't have brought that out... which indicates a bit of bad service or frugality? 

Entree-- I love that they give big portions for the Kalbi but it didn't taste very authentic and it was a bit too sweet for me. The Japchae was the same-- big portions, but a bit sweet.

I think Miega is a decent Korean restaurant in Cleveland, but it could be better."}
{"text":"This place rocks it with their _____ out.  

The decor  is pretty amazing.  A lot of the art work was from the guy next door.  Oh yeah come for Korean and you get an art show too. Did I mention that the Japanese drumming squad practices upstairs  as well, you may get some pretty cool music on a Sunday!

I was the only person there for an early dinner during the week. There was some Korean soap opera on their TV,  I kind of had a look of befuddlement on my face and they changed the show to some Korean  music video stuff.  I'm not sure which was the lesser of two evils. Back to the important stuff.

The service was great,  The two ladies that took care of me made sure my water and  barley tea were never empty, as well as my banchan side salads.  I think I was offered 8 different sides. They some how knew I did not want the uber fishy mini fishy anchovy things, I was glad about that! The only thing I can think of imagine kissing someone with that on their breath!

I ordered a spicy pork dish on a sizzling platter. It was very good, I asked for it to be Korean spicy, and it was a 6 out of 10! The other dish was the kimchee Jigea or something like that.  It is a kimchee,pork and tofu stew, Very tasty was well. This is good vibe place."}
{"text":"I was excited to try a new Korean place out and was hoping it would replace Seoul Garden in Parma as a closer alternative since I moved to the east side.  Ultimately it turned out to be average, if not underwhelming.

It's a nice little spot located on the second floor of the Asian Town Center. I was expecting grill tables (a la Seoul Hot Pot) due to the namesake (Korean BBQ) but was left a little disappointed when not one was in sight. The place was packed to the brim on a Saturday night, and the service was very friendly although not very dependable.

We made reservations but still had to wait about 20 minutes, which wasn't much of an issue since most of our party was late. Our table had a nifty little button on it that allowed us to summon our server. It wasn't as effective as we hoped because it took a while for the server to get to us, but it's nice to know they give customers the ability.  We had a big party so our server was a little confused with our orders and we had to go around a number of times. They also missed one of our orders.

We had a decent array of banchan, most of which tasted very good, but still can't hold a candle to the wide selection Seoul Garden offers.  We started off with \"Gu Man Du\" (fried dumplings), which tasted phenomenal. For the main entree, I ended up ordering Bok Eum (octopus, squid, veggies in a VERY spicy sauce). I was a little disappointed they didn't offer Tteokbokki, which I thought was a traditional dish and figured this would be similar. I will just say that this dish is EXTREMELY spicy with not much other flavor to it at all. I love spicy Korean but if it just feels like I'm putting spoonfuls of red chili paste in my mouth then it's not much of a meal. I was sweating and my mouth was on fire. I wouldn't order it again.

Others in my party ordered: 

- Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap, which did taste great
- some spicy pork dish I can't remember the name of, but it tasted JUST like my dish except with pork
- noodles in a stir fried black bean paste, which was a bit different to me but accurately prepared according to the one who ordered it and loved it

Overall, I wasn't impressed but didn't think it was too bad. I would go back but I wouldn't be in any rush. They have some menu items that I am interested in trying still, such as their japchae, bulgogi, Korean pancake, and galbi.

Oh, and prices were a little jacked up compared to other places but not by much."}
{"text":"Doesn't have the LA korean style bbq but they do have the table top grill! The seasoning on the steaks are amazing and the staff is extremely on point and warm welcoming.  I totally recommend this place and their food. Dont set ur standards too high and expect it to be like NY or LA."}
{"text":"So I've been here a few times, and I've been quite happy with the food served, but unfortunately, the service can rather slow at times.  The menu seems to be offering an increasing number of options each time I go, and most things I've tried thus far have been delicious.  One of my favorite dishes is a soup filled with rice cakes and seasoned beef (unfortunately I'm currently blanking on the name).   The bi bim bap is also quite tasty (best when served with kalbi!).  Many of my friends have enjoyed dishes served with whole fish, although I have found them a little bit too fishy for my tastes.  The banchan are also good, with various assortments of kimchi and other pickled vegetables.  The unfortunate part is that the service, although very kind, can be a bit slow when the place gets busy.  If the restaurant is packed, you may be stuck there for several hours.  The wait time is much better when the restaurant is less busy, however.  In addition to food, Miega offers karaoke in an adjacent room.  The room is spacious, allowing for a large party.  The equipment takes up a small corner, and the books offer an oddball mix of English, Korean, and Japanese songs.  Those interested in karaoke would be happy to note that karaoke is free with dinner, although only one room is available, so it's best if reserved in advance."}
{"text":"For this new Korean restaurant in Cleveland, I tried the dol sat bi bim bap, which was tasty and had teh nice crusty layer of rice on the bottom (my favorite!).  I wish there were more meat though.  My friends and I also split a seafood pancake, which was fantasticly delicious with large chunks of seafood in it.  The side dishes is really what knocked it down a star for me because they were just 'ok'.  I've definitely had much better side dishes before, and I think that was a miss here.  The decor was nice, and service was friendly, though a bit slow.  

Some tips: bathroom is outside of the restaurant to the right, and there's a karaoke room across the hallway too.  I found that interesting.  Restaurant was nicely crowded when we went on Saturday night around 7PM."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Miega for years and finally decided to write a review because this place is great! I've come here with friends in groups and by myself for lunch, no problems whatsoever. 

The Food
I've tried multiple things off of the menu. I love the barbeque, it's a great way to eat with friends as you can cook it at your table. The menu in that area is pretty extensive and well-priced. Their kimbap and dokkbokki are also pretty good.

If I don't come here for the barbeque I come here for the sundubu jigae with seafood. It's a lovely stew that screams comfort food. Miega, out of all of the Korean restaurants in the area, does it best. They don't skimp out on the veggies (onions and zucchini), the tofu, or the seafood. There's always a lot of seafood and the dish looks like a stew as a opposed to a soup, as it should. Plus there's a raw egg thrown in that cooks along with the stew as you eat it (it's in a hot stone pot). As to the spice level, I wouldn't say this is spicy but it's definitely not mild. It's hard to give a good gauge as well...I'm white and hardly ate spicy food before spending several months in Korea - the taste buds adapted. I would highly recommend it, if you come for lunch it's a bit cheaper! My total was $11 for lunch - not bad considering the amount of food you get!

Miega also does great banchan (side dishes). You normally get the staple, kimchi (two types: radish and cabbage), and the rest is often a guess but it's always good. This time around I got dried squid in a sauce, never had it before but it was beyond good. What's more, if you run out of a side dish, you can ask for more - same goes for rice and it's at no extra charge.

VEGEGTARIANS - note that while there may be veggie options, if you aren't pescatarian I'd double check if they use things like anchovies, fish sauce, etc. Anchovies can often be found in the making of the broth itself for some of the dishes. 

The Price
I'd say the price is spot on for the food. In comparison to other Korean restaurants in the area, I would argue it's cheaper for some dishes than other places. Even though that's the case, the menu is extensive, decently priced, and everything's delicious. 

The Atmosphere
The place is well decorated and doesn't feel confined. There's plenty of tables, both booths with the grill installed and normal tables. If you come at a busy time wanting barbeque and there's no booths, not too worry, Miega can set you up with a portable grill at a table (similar to how Seoul Garden does). It's clean and there's normally a tv playing that's visible to the patrons, always fun if there's a music program going on.

The Service
I've always had great service here. The servers are very open to answering your questions and giving you recommendations, great for those who don't know too much about Korean food. A lot, if not most, of the tables are equipped with a button that rings to get the servers attention. I love the type of service, you are left alone to enjoy your food unless you need help and then you ring the bell."}
{"text":"Amazing service!  Great banchan!  Wonderful food!

The staff is extremely nice and accommodating.  Both lunch and dinner offerings are impressive.  I've been several times and plan to keep going back!"}
{"text":"First Korean BBQ I've been to in cle. Only one tv to watch k pop, which, let's be real, is a large part of my meal aesthetic. Aside from that, Miega delivers lightning fast service. We got a few different meals to try, and the bulgogi was great, which is definitely my favorite. I did not enjoy the seafood pancake, so I don't have much to say in regards to their seafood. Just so you know, it's on the second floor of a huge grocery store; because it took us a second to figure that out. I like that I could just get bulgogi and not have to pair it with a different meat; but overall I thought it was a little pricier than other kbbq's I've been to. But, you get tons of sides and overall it was a great time. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Me and my mom came here and it was her first time at a Korean place! The waiter was incredibly nice and helpful. The restaurant is beautiful and plays Korean shows as well! First we sat down, and the waiter recommended the short ribs to us, and they did not disappoint! Definitely highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the greatest, best, most authentic Korean BBQ in Cleveland. My fiance and I go here maybe once a month - we want to go more, as we are constantly craving it, but we need to set some boundaries!

The location is a bit funny, it is on the second floor of a shopping plaza - we have rarely seen any other stores open in the building, but there still seems to be some people around. There is also the grocery store right on the first floor that we always stop at before to pick up some goodies.

The food - amazing. We have our favorite go-tos but always try something new. By far our favorite is the C4 chicken with sweet and spicy sauce, it is just phenomenal and has the perfect amount of crispiness and spice. We get this every time. We also always get their bibibop which is also cooked to perfection. I cant name everything else we've gotten, because like I said, we always try a new dish when we are there and it is always amazing - but we've tried their short ribs, octopus, etc, all great. We also have done their Miega BBQ, which is very yummy and the staff is so helpful, however their prepared dishes are so great that we usually go with those. 

Another amazing thing here is there special spicy gochuchang sauce that they have bottled at every table. We literally put it on everything and whatever it is, it is just SO GOOD. 

The other amazing news is the ~7 authentic side dishes come with everything. They change it up based on what is available, in season, and it is great to taste the new concoctions they come up with. We always love each and every one of them. 

The other great thing I love about this restaurant is the staff and authenticity. It is family owned and all the recipes come from the grandmother who splits her time from this restaurant to her other one in Korea (can't remember which town). They also are so so sweet and accommodating. Everything she makes is so authentic and delicious, i cant say enough about it. JUST GO and be so please :)"}
{"text":"This place rocks. BBQ was great, spicy squid was tasty, Cham chai noodles awesome, very friendly service"}
{"text":"The food are pretty good and authentic, their Barbeque is the best among other courses and is a must try. The Barbeque machine is super easy to use and smoke free. Price is fair consider how the food taste. The waitress lady is very nice too. I give 4 star because of the taste and price."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last night with one of my best friends, on the suggestion of another friend. Best friend (J) and I love Korean food, and almost went to Ha Ahn, our usual favorite food joint. Neither of us had been to Miega, so we opted for something new. Initially, we went to Korea House thinking it might be the place we were looking for. Miega is basically across the street, housed in a warehouse type building that also has dance classes, martial arts, and an Asian market. The parking lot was kind of dim, and it took us a minute to find the sign so we knew we were in the right place (that might be our faults - we can both be a little ditzy!)

So one thing that is confusing is that some signs say \"Miga\" and others \"Miega\" (I went with Miega because how could Yelp be wrong?). They have Korean barbecue, but we didn't partake (partially because they didn't ask and we were sat at a table that doesn't accommodate it). We arrived 3 hours before close, so I'm not sure what that was about. I ended up going with Dduk Man Du Kuk (a broth based soup that had dumplings and Korean rice cakes, served with white rice). I usually opt for Bi Bim Bop, but wanted to try something new. J went for Bul Go Gi (which came out sizzling on a cow shaped platter! Sorry for the lack of pictures, we were STARVING). 

As usual at Korean restaurants, you get the little appetizers. I liked that our server asked if we needed any more (more of the kim chi! also, i think we had butternut squash which I devoured). I was a little bummed that my soup came out, then a few minutes later the appetizers, but J had to wait a little more for his food. It seemed worth it, and he enjoyed it. We both agreed that Ha Ahn is better (although has less seating). I like that there are some glass walls so you can look out in to the mall area (I got to watch people practicing martial arts). There was a dance class going on further down, and the music was loud, but not annoying to us (also, high five to the salsa dancers! You all rocked and we loved watching you). 

I didn't finish my soup (I was full), but the server didn't ask if I wanted it to go or if I was done. She just whisked it away. There wasn't a ton left, but I would have taken it for lunch today! Since I checked in on Yelp, I ended up with a coupon for 15% off, which they easily took off. So, overall, the food was good but not great. The ambiance was a little bland, but we weren't there on a romantic date night (we both left our partners at home!). Our food didn't take long to come out at all, and if you don't dig Korean, there is a limited Chinese food portion of the menu."}
{"text":"This fairly new restaurant is on the second floor of Asia Town Plaza on Superior Ave. not to be confused with Asia Plaza on Payne. 

This establishment is nicely decorated with an inviting, comfortable atmosphere. 

We arrived around 3pm for a late lunch; we were the only diners there. The service was good, attentive and efficient. Even though it was 3pm, they allowed me to get their lunch specials (the menu said lunch was from 11am - 2pm). 

I ordered the braised short ribs lunch box which came with a bowl of miso soup. Our server brought us 5 side dishes as accompaniment to the entrees we ordered. 

The food came quickly. My lunch box had six different items within - the beef, fried rice, salad, noodles, radish, and dumplings. It was a lot of food for $11.95 The food was tasty and I would get it again, but perhaps with another type of meat (they has pork and chicken too).

My spouse ordered some pot stickers as an appetizer which arrived super quickly. Those were served with a nice dipping sauce and were delicious. She also ordered a tempura dish which she did not like because it was not served with any sauce. (I think it was supposed to and the server forgot)

I would visit this restaurant again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Authentic Korean BBQ. Good food. Good service. All the dishes I tried were good. When I went with friends that were not willing to try certain meat on the BBQ combo, they were nice enough to sub it with something else. Thank you."}
{"text":"Just there yesterday and enjoyed it, it's kind of deceiving when you first see the place because it's in like an old warehouse building and you have to look for it, for the signs to find it. I always let my friend pick out the meals because she really knows what she is doing so I couldn't tell you much on what we ordered but I enjoyed it and the food was good but when you order eight different items and cook it at the table it's not really going to be cheap but it was worth it, food was fresh waitress was very nice and would go back there in a minute. And by the way it's upstairs on the second floor with a Chinese grocery store and other businesses downstairs, try it."}
{"text":"Best Korean place in the Cleveland area so far."}
{"text":"The restaurant has improved on their karaoke room (they prettied up the room and got a bigger TV), so I wanted to write a quick update.  A couple of things to mention about their karaoke:
1) It's free.
2) The room is set up in an American style, even though they use Asian karaoke books.  That is, there is a stage with two microphones, and people sing facing the audience versus facing the TV.  They also have a disco ball and a smoke machine.
3) The song selection is not as good as Korea House - there are distinctly fewer recent songs.
4) They kicked us out at 9 pm on the Friday we went because they \"needed to set up the room for the next day.\"

For being free, it's pretty good.  But otherwise I'd say Korea House is your better bet.

The service here is still impeccably good (with the cute little call buttons at the tables), and the food is still quite delicious.  The stone pot bi bim bop is decently-sized and tasty, and my friends really like their tofu soups. They no longer have the steamed egg side dish that I mentioned in my earlier review."}
{"text":"The food is OK, especially their hot pot and barbecue. I gave this rate because of the awful service. I have been here so many times and the waitress in Korean traditional costumes is awesome. She is polite. But yesterday, the new skinny tall Korean waitress I never met before made my dinner experience so awful! She is rude, with her eyes looking down to you and speak in impatient voice. Drop your beverage, dishes on the table with huge noise, which made me wonder if we did anything wrong. Not need to even mention that she brought wrong beverages to us and just said casually \"she thought we ordered this\" while we never ordered. No napkins, no stop by during the dinner to add water, no yogurt after dinner, no customer receipt but only merchant copy for us to sign. And pushed us to check out faster. Terrible! I had never had any waiter or waitress like this before. Don't want to go back anymore if this lady is going to be there serving all the time."}
{"text":"All the food we ordered was delicious! My friend came up to visit Cleveland and the one thing she wanted to eat was Korean food. I have only been to one Korean place since moving here. I once lived in Parma and Seoul garden was the closest. They did not disappoint so Miega had expectations to live up to. They delivered! We ordered seafood Soon Du Bu Jji Gae, Kim bob, Sam Gyeop Sal, Jja jang Myun, and dolsot Bi Bim Bob. I recommend the Kim bob, BBQ meats, and  jja Jang myun! Most places don't have good noodles but this place did. Also we wanted to use the 15% coupon when you check in on yelp but you can only use that during a weekday so keep that in mind. Happy eating!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! I typically find Korean places in Cleveland to be really \"meh\". This place was slightly above \"meh\", which is great in my opinion! Definitely not my all time favorite, but I can see myself coming back if in the mood for Korean food.

Kimbap wasn't as great as some other places. I only really enjoys 2 of the small dishes. What I did love was the seafood pancake. Crispy, yet chewy! The kalbi was also good. The friend who I went with is a recovering vegetarian, and she was into the meat, har har har. We also ordered some dokboki. I'm actually not into the sauce on dokboki, so I won't comment on the quality of that dish. I wouldn't mind coming back and trying a rice dish (preferably dol sot bibimbap), a stew (preferably budae jjigae), or noodle plate (preferably jajangmyeon). That would be the ultimate test if I really love this place or not!"}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland for a week and ordered take out for the first time and it was just average. Their kimbab was really delicious though. The rice was still warm and it was fresh and yummy. Their kimchi fried rice tasted of fish sauce which I found it to be a bit overwhelming. Wish there was more kimchi in it. Their tofu spicy pork dish was just average as well. Had hard time finding the place, the GPS stopped me in front of Korea House, which was another Korean restaurant. This one is located further down the same street, inside a big old empty mall, on the second floor.  I'm not from Cleveland and I found this location to be rather strange. But alas, I fed my stomach and that's all that matters."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Been here several times! Seafood & Kimchi pancake, neungmian taste good!"}
{"text":"My favorite Korean place in Cleveland! The service is always fast and friendly and food is really quality. My favorite is the hot pot (which costs around $30 and can be shared by at least four people). They have multiple options but I like the one with octopus and bolgolgi. I've also gotten the soondubu (amazing), bi bim bap, kalbi, and rice cakes and all of the dishes were great. Their banchan, which is complimentary side dishes, is always really good and they bring you as many refills as you want."}
{"text":"Don't know why this place was so empty when I went to dinner here earlier this week.  I'm not a good judge of the authenticity of Korean food given that most of the restaurants I've been to are all in Cleveland, but I thought the food tasted pretty good.   I really liked the kimchi scallion pancake, which was tasty but not too greasy.  My friends and I ordered the Korean barbecue with two different cuts of meat - the pork belly and the sliced beef.  Extra points for the service that night - the restaurant was empty, so the waiter stuck around to cook all of our meat for us.  One thing that I would want more of were the side dishes - while decent, other restaurants serve a much larger variety.  The waiter informed me that the owners may be installing tabletop grills soon.  I told him to persuade the owners to install charcoal tabletop grills - if this happens, I'll definitely be dropping by more often."}
{"text":"This inviting new establishment is likely to become the best Korean restaurant in Cleveland, if it isn't already.

Miega occupies a newly-created space on the second floor of Asian Town Center (a nicely rehabbed former factory building, with a large parking lot entered via East 38th Street).

Miega's decor is modern, bright, and artistic.  Diners choose seating at comfortably spaced tables or booths.

My girlfriend and I enjoyed a leisurely meal at Miega on Saturday, July 9, 2011 -- just a few days after the restaurant first opened.

We shared an appetizer: Gunmandu (meat-filled fried dumplings) [$4.95 for 4].  Served with a tangy dipping sauce (soy sauce + vinegar + scallion), the dumplings were golden-brown, piping hot, and delicious.

Having frequented many Korean restaurants, we are accustomed to the serving of banchan, a complimentary assortment of five to nine side dishes -- some spicy, some mild.  At first, we were a bit disappointed to receive just four banchan, accompanying the appetizer.  However, we were quite pleased when four additional side dishes later arrived with our entrees.  All were tasty.  Our server offered to refill any of the banchan, should we wish more.

Miega's menu offers a wide range of tantalizing entrees.  We picked three:

-- Bulgogi (thinly sliced marinated beef, grilled together with onion slices) [$18.95, for a dinner-size portion].  Tender, flavorful, but rather pricey.  Were we perhaps served the smaller lunch size, by mistake?  (We placed our order shortly after the lunch period ended.)

-- Udon Noodle Soup (topped with two tempura shrimp) [$10.95].  A large bowl; plenty for the price.

-- Dolsot Bibimbap (a rice dish with colorful vegetables, beef, squid, and egg -- which continue to cook in a very hot stone pot) [$12.95].  A generous portion and a good value.  Note: When your bibimbap is served, be sure to mix in some of Miega's homemade gochujang (hot pepper paste), to suit your taste for savory heat.

Miega serves soft drinks and quality teas; no alcohol.  I phoned ahead and was told that diners are welcome to bring their own adult beverages.  I carried in a bottle of soju, which our waiter kept chilled until we were ready to drink it.

It's a pleasure to report that our server was particularly attentive, checking on our needs, at just the right times.  He and others frequently cleared away empty bowls and plates -- something that doesn't always happen at other local Korean restaurants, apparently due to cultural differences between Korea and the U.S.

I learned that the Miega staff is currently refining their menu, adjusting certain portion sizes and prices, to reflect market conditions and satisfy diner preferences.  It will be interesting to see how this appealing restaurant develops over time.

Discount Tip: When you are in the area, stop into Asian Town Center and pick up a Miega business card.  Present the card on your next visit, for 20% off your entire order.  (I saved $10 on my July 9th meal, but happily tipped on the full amount.)"}
{"text":"I've been back recently.  It's improved.  The quality of the ban panchan has increased, as has the food quality.  I've ordered things besides the hot pots, and was absolutely blown away.  

My earlier assessment of the restaurant being empty frequently has also fallen by the wayside.  I'm glad their business is picking up, they certainly deserve it!"}
{"text":"I was struggling to find a fun and convenient venue to host my friend's surprise birthday party when I noticed Miega's party room. Many people overlook the party room but it's a FANTASTIC venue with great lighting effects, a karaoke system, and great microphone and sound system. The area was spacious and even had a wooden stage floor. Even though the room was in a separate space across from the main restaurant, the staff was very attentive, considerate, and friendly and consistently refilled our drinks and served our food as soon as it left the stove.

For the party, we were unprepared and did not have plates, utensils, or knives for the birthday cake. However, not only did Miega let us store 3 cartons of ice cream in their freezer, but also provided plates, spoons, and their own kitchen knife to help us serve 21 party guests! They even prepared 21 separate checks at the cash register so that we could pay any time we wanted to during the course of the party.

All in all, my friends and I had a great evening. Thank you, Miega. :)"}
{"text":"First foray into Korean food, and I was pretty impressed.  Don't be afraid to ask questions (we had NO clue what the \"sides\" were when they came to the table), and enjoy the unquestionable goodness that is Korean food.

After your meal, go downstairs to the market - a great day out!"}
{"text":"This is truly one of the BEST Korean BBQ restaurants in Cleveland.  Miega is located on the second floor of a small shopping center where there is a nice market on the first floor with rare fruits and several unique Asian food products.  SEVERAL things/places to see and do before/after you visit Miega.  

The restaurant is a fairly small place to eat, less than 20 tables, but it does NOT take away from the scenery.  Big screen TV's  are located throughout the restaurant showing Korean TV shows.  
Whether you arrive at lunch time (11 am-3 pm) or dinnertime, the prices are fair especially for the portions you receive!  The side dishes you receive before your meal are a GREAT addition to any meal (The Kimchi is wonderful for anyone who likes spicy food).  If you order the dumplings they are the size of pierogies and have a lot of flavor.  

Our main dishes did not disappoint either.  I order the Noodle dish with the black bean paste and it was a LARGE portion for the lunch special!  My friend lover her dish as well.  She ordered the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bob served in the hot stone pot and she let me try a small portion of it and for those who LOVE spicy the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bob will not be a let down!  

The ONLY issue we have ever had at Miega in the dozen or so meals we have dined on is that there has always been only one server but WOW is she quick!  She has a three shelved cart on wheels and she moves but if it's busy your food will take a little longer."}
{"text":"I went there to find a better Korean Restaurant in Cleveland but I decided to make it the first and last visit. 

Food: taste is just plain with not many selections compare to other places.  The most important thing is price!!!!   It's quite expensive and overpriced. I had thought Korean house across the street was very expensive but here is like 30-50% more expensive than other places.  I can name several cheaper korean places with better food quality. 

Decoration is great since it's brand-new restaurant. Place is nice and clean. 

Service is just ok. Only one person does almost everything. We had to wait for water, bill, food, etc. But that's not too bad. 

Overall, I probably do not go there again to pay overpriced food there (Hot pot is like 36-40 compare to 25-28 at Seoul Garden)"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant with worst service ever. She had been rude and impatient from the very beginning. She literally threw the straws on the table, and didn't give us any of the items like bowls for soup, bbq sauce for meat, etc. The way she spoke to us was also irritating. It turned out that we had soup without bowls, ate meat without bbq sauce and finished our dinner with anger. I will never go to Miega ever again and will definitely tell my friends not to go. If you want to have a highly unpleasant meal with your friends and get really angry at the service, Miega is the place!"}
{"text":"First time here. We had a large group so we called ahead. Both the service and food were excellent. The seafood pancake and the homemade dumplings (steamed and fried) were great. I ordered the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bob which is served in a hot stone pot. This is great with the red pepper paste. I definitely recommend this place and will go again."}
{"text":"I have been to this place way too many times and every time I go there, I order their chap chae (clear noodle with beef). It was absolutely the most beautiful thing they created there!

Other stuff were just regular korean food. I would not recommend their rice cake dish - the color was orange, not red so that's off and it tasted off too. Not sure what went wrong but just bad.

The service there was pretty good. You can ask for more side dishes if you finish them too early (I always do that). They also have a big karaoke room across the hall way and we celebrated our friend's birthday in that giant party room."}
{"text":"I'm not familiar with Cleveland so it took me a while to find the restaurant. You actually need to turn on 38th Ave. and then turn into the parking lot of the grocery store. When you go in, go up the stairs and you'll see Miega. Miega seemed to be the only store upstairs, but I didn't really look around. It looks as though the building is being remodeled and maybe there will be more restaurants/stores coming soon. 

First off, I think that the name of their restaurant is misleading. The reason i decided to come to Miega vs the other Korean restaurants in town was because I was expecting a Korean BBQ with a grill at each table where you can grill your own meat.  I was a little disappointed to see this was a Korean restaurant not a Korean BBQ. There were no built in grills at any of the tables. I honestly think I should give this restaurant a 2 star rating because I was very disappointed that it was not an actual Korean BBQ! Very misleading!! Change your name!

As far as Korean restaurants go, it's not a really fancy restaurant but seemed like a clean, quick place to grab a bite to eat. There was a large screen where you could watch Korean TV.

Food:
The bahn chan (side dishes) were pretty good but they didn't offer us any refills. (But we didn't ask for refills either). They had a lot of the typical bahn chan like kimchi, bean sprouts (kong nah mool), fish cakes (odeng). I really liked their pickled hot peppers and the small little korean pancakes.  

For the meal, we got the Galbi dolsot bibimbap and the Jja jang myun. The galbi in the bibimbap was pretty tasty but it didn't seem like there was much of a variety for the vegetables in the bibimbap. 

As for the Jjajangmyun, it was sweeter than what I'm used to.  It also seemed that the noodles were dry noodles that they boiled as opposed to the fresh dough ones. (Although I may be mistaken). There were also a LOT of onion and not much meat in the sauce. Definitely not the best jjajangmyun that I've had but better some places. 

I decided to give Miega a 3 start rating because the banchan was pretty good, the service was good, the waitress was nice and attentive (but then again there were hardly any other people in the restaurant), and overall the food was ok for the price."}
{"text":"This is not the best Korean in town, but it will definitely do.  

On my second and third visit, I ordered the Kimchi Jigae, which is spicy kimchi, pork and tofu soup served in a hot stone pot.  Add some rice and it's delicious.  Tasted very authentic with limitless spice and flavor.  

I've also tried the Dol Set Bi Bim Bap, but something wasn't right and I found myself adding more and more sauce just to get the right flavor, which never was the case.  I have tried making it myself, so I know a lot goes into marinating and cooking all of the vegetables in a very specific way, but I'd hit up another Korean restaurant for some tasty BiBimBap (Seoul Garden)

They've got a great location in the Asian Town Center which has a variety of things to do on a crappy day.  Get some cheap produce and ethnic food at the grocery!  Watch the martial arts class! Visit the art galleries! Listen to a poetry read!
It's a fun little plaza it is."}
{"text":"Was craving Korean Chinese food and it looked like it was the only one in Cleveland. Found out it was on the 2nd floor of this giant asian mall building. I ordered jjajjangmyun and tangsooyuk (black bean sauce noodle and sweet and sour pork).

The portions were very generous. Thought the jjajjangmyun was a bit bland and the pork a little soggy. It's good if you're craving Korean Chinese food, but it could be better."}
{"text":"Went on 3/14/2015 with my sister and a niece who loves all things Korean. It was our first time trying Korean food, and we wanted to try a number of things. I didn't know whether I would like Korean food because it is not similar to anything I would normally eat, but I found literally everything to be delicious. If you are well versed in Korean cuisine, I can't say whether it will meet your standards, but give the place place a try. As a newbie,  I loved it! We ended up going there when my sister saw a positive review for it in the newspaper.

I'll try to describe the things we ordered. I do not know the proper names. We ordered a stew with beef and octopus that was kept warm on a hot plate at our table.  They did not skimp on ingredients in the stew. There was plenty of octopus and beef as well as whole shrimp, oysters, and veggies.  We also ordered a beef that we cooked at our table and wrapped in lettuce to eat. Chicken terryiake. Fried and steamed dumplings. The seafood pancake, which I highly reccomend. Rice cakes in a spicy broth, I think called Dduk Bok Ee.  As well as another beef dish we ordered when we saw it arrive at a different table because it looked so tasty.

The waitress was very pleasant and didn't mind telling us what different things were or how to eat them. The service was timely enough. The place had a steady stream of customers and only one waitress and one busser from what I saw, but we didn't feel we had to wait very long for our food despite ordering quite a lot.  The tip was not included in the bill, and I left a pretty hefty one for the gracious service.  The restaurant is in a somewhat empty-feeling building, but the decor is nice.  I will definitely go back. I want to try the remainder of menu!"}
{"text":"What is a non-meat-eating, half-Korean gal to do? Since cutting most meat out of my diet, I had very rarely looked back... until it came time to go to a Korean BBQ with friends. It was the first time I found myself longingly craving meat. The bulgogi and samgupsal and even kimchi jigae was now pretty much off-limits.

However, I discovered that Miega is by far the most accomodating Korean restaurant in Cleveland when it comes to non-carnivores. It is not on the menu, but if they have the ingredients, they will make the most beautiful, delicious platter of vegetarian gim-bap (Korean sushi) with freshly cooked fried eggs. The kimchi jigae is already made vegetarian (the pork is added after the stew cooks, so it's easy to omit). My husband ordered vegetarian bibimbap and they left out the bulgogi and added tofu in one of the most beautifully-arranged bibimbaps I've ever seen!

I occasionally eat fish, and this is the place to have it! The grilled mackerel is delicious with rice and kimchi. 

All of the banchan items that are served before the entrees have been delicious!   

The servers are wonderful - I always enjoy trying to use the very, very small amount of conversational Korean I know with them, and they are happy to humor me and offer pronunciation help. 

Tip: Another great thing about Miega (I hope/think)  is that it is BYOB. We have brought a bottle of wine to dinner there a couple times. When I visited Korea, drinking soju with every meal was customary - I now tend to feel like any Korean dinner (well, I guess any dinner) seems more festive with a bottle shared with friends."}
{"text":"Took my family here to celebrate my mom's bday. They have never tried Korean BBQ so it's a must, in my opinion to experience. 
Parking and location are great! It's upstairs in the Asian Town Center and there's ample parking. They take credit cards like normal people and the owner even offered a free appetizer on account of our celebration. 

This place isn't strictly a BBQ place, unfortunately but the setup was definitely fine. I ordered the beef brisket and pork belly BBQ entrees, plus the iconic bibimpbap, of course. The cuts of meat were prime. My mom is the pickiest eater and would normally never touch beef but even she had to admit the beef cuts were super fresh and tender. The side dishes were ample but lacking in variety compared a few other Korean BBQ places I've been to. We each got a bowl of miso soup AND salad so that was great for value. The individual bowls of rice even had little lids to seal in the heat so I appreciated that detail as well. The meats were not pre-marinated but the sauces were yum. Service was not bad and I even got to take 2 boxes of leftovers home. I highly recommend this place in you're in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"My friend called me last Saturday asking if I wanted to get some brunch at Le Petite Triangle. We went and there was a wait as usual. I flipped through some bookmarks on Yelp and we decided on Miega. There is a weird false door with a crazy face on it. Don't try to go through that one or else you will look dumb as we did. There was a martial arts class going on across from the restaurant which was cool to walk past and see. The interior of the restaurant is contemporary and very clean. The music that was playing was awesome. They had some Korean sounding hip-hop which reminded me of an album my brother gave to me for Christmas in '97 or '98 called Bomb Worldwide: International Rap Compilation. I love to hear rap music from other countries. The service bell on the table was very cool. I am definitely not the prude I once was and now really enjoy Korean food. My favorite dish was S15 Gal Bi Dol Sot Bi Bim Bob. My friend and I both agreed that this was one of the best brunches ever. My little hangover was gone immediately."}
{"text":"This place is upstairs, 2nd floor of the Asia Plaza, unique location to say the least. A Karate class was in session right across the way, which got me pumped up about my visit here. I felt like I was really in Seoul, too bad the food didn't complete this feeling.  My friend worked the Miega hut at the Asian Festival, I got BBQ chicken and it was pretty dam good, I was really excited to check this place out. 

We enter and take our seats, a cool call-bell was attached to our table, at first I didn't know what it was, then we asked. You know what they say, ask and you shall receive. Our waiter was quick and friendly. 

I had the Bi Bim Bop and it was a lot of food, but not all that great, it's hard to mess this up. The taste just wasn't there. They say you're body goes through a cycle, or complete change every ten years or so. Right before I turned 30 was my change. I used to love not and spicy cuisine. I just can't do it anymore. I remember before I was 20 I couldn't eat so much as Franks Red Hot without my mouth burning. Before I knew it I was eating a 7-8 on the Thai menus. Mexican. The hotter the better, now that palate is no longer available for me, my tummy doesn't like it. Maybe when I'm 40 I'll be back in the game. When that happens I'll check this place out again, if it still exists, keep messin up Bi Bim Bop, I can assure you won't be. 

In the middle of the floor, in the worst spot in the whole restaurant was a table bearing a reserved sign on it. It gave off the idea that it was some presidential reservation, yet it was in the lowest of peasants coordinates, maybe I'm out of the loop. It was good for a laugh though. I posted the pic of it once site."}
{"text":"My first time eating Korean food--and a good place to learn.  Must use chopsticks!  Very nice venue, good food, great service. BBQ means you cook on a table grill. Hot pot means you cook veggies in a boiling cauldron of broth. Chinese dishes, too. This can be a social activity for several people. Lots of food. Took some home. Don't let the exterior of this Asian Town building keep you away. Has a grocery store, too which is an interesting walk thru. Had a wonderful time at a new experience."}
{"text":"Before I begin this review, I'd like to let the public know this: I am generally easy to please, as far as service is concerned. That being said, I had probably the worst experience of my life at Miega. 

Let me get the issues with service out of the way before discussing the food. First, It took ten minutes for receive menus after being seated, to say nothing of drinks. When we got our menus, the server dashed away from the table without asking if we needed anything, or bringing waters. We should have taken that as a sign, but we'd been told the food was good, so we decided to tough it out. Everything from then on was a chore. Getting watre and tea, refills water and tea, placing our order, receiving our order, where the f**k is our banchan, etc. The service here is a shining example of a spectacular failure.

The food was boring at best, offensively bad at worst. After waiting for about half an hour, my boyfriend and I were finally able to place our order: a seafood pancake for an appetizer, bibimbap for my main, and a spicy pork dish for his. The seafood pancake took 20-30 minutes to come out, the bibimbap followed in about 10 minutes, and the spicy pork took another 10 minutes. I felt bad for my boyfriend. The seafood pancake was pretty much inedible. What it lacked in flavor, it made up for in grease. He couldn't eat it. I was starving, so I had a couple of pieces, and was really thankful when my bibimbap came out. Well, at least until I tasted it. It was the most bland, flavorless bibimbap I'd ever had. Let's be real here: bibimbap is rice with vegetables and meat on top. How is it possible to f**k that up? Miega found a way. The gojuchang that came with it tasted like ketchup. Disgusting. My boyfriend was still waiting for his pork, looking hungry and cranky. When it finally came out, it was missing a pretty crucial component: rice! It took about five minutes to flag down a server to ask. Then we waited, and waited, and asked again, and waited.... The rice never showed up. Who serves a stir fried dish without rice? The dish itself was as bland as everything else, and doused in that same ketchupy gojuchang. By this point, my boyfriend didn't even care... he was just happy to finally have some food in front of him.

Oh, and did I mention this place is friggin' expensive? $45 for lunch for two. 

To summarize: We were there for two hours, had the most inattentive service of our lives, had a really bad lunch, and still had to drop nearly $50. 

Bummer."}
{"text":"Best Korean bbq in Cleveland! The owner is always so nice and reminds me of my family. The food is always fresh and authentic. There's always a great variety of different ban chan. For appetizers, the house made dumplings are great! I've had many dishes here from the casseroles to be and all is amazing! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Clearly, the trend for me has been Asian food as one can tell I really love it. Miega is also a new place I tried recently and while I never really experienced Korean BBQ, I am happily a convert now. Such a cute little place on Superior--where so many of the Asian places are--and always packed. When we went recently, I ended up getting deep fried chicken and it was incredible. My friend decided on the Angelfish and while it seems strange, it was amazing. They have such a diverse menu that anyone can find something here. I also ordered some pancake and dumplings to take home and they were great--even re heated the next day. Again, nothing super swanky, but really great."}
{"text":"Korean BBQ is not as good as Korean BBQ in California or east coast .. However still better than the mid west Korean BBQ options . It still has all the basics and good enough that I will return to eat there . There aren't too many Korean restaurant options in Cleveland ."}
{"text":"Somehow this place has been hiding from me for the past year - I am an avid Korean food fan and was resigned to occasional visits to Korea House when in Cleveland, as there are just too many great places in NY, DC and CA to compare inferior Korean food to.  However!  This place was so pleasantly surprising that I was motivated to write my first review since moving to CLE.

First of all, it's very clean and modernly decorated.  Pleasant lighting, lots of space, shiny surfaces and quaint little seat cushions great you when you come in the door.  We were seated in a booth on the side because we had a larger party.  

The banchan - excellent variety, better than I've seen at Korea House.  They included: bean sprouts, pickled cucumbers, seaweed noodle things, cabbage kimchi, shittake mushrooms, broccoli, seaweed, kohlrabi, anchovies.  Very good quality pickled dishes as I didn't try the seafood ones.  

The entrees - we ordered the japchae, galbi, dolsoht bibimbap, and kimchi pajeon to share.  It was just the right amount of food for 4 people.  The kimchi pajeon was very crispy on the outside, had good flavor, was maybe a tad too thick but pretty good.  The japchae was excellently cooked, really nice flavor but could have have more veggies.  The galbi was marinated really well, had a grilled look to it and my only suggestion would be that it was a tad on the thick side (but I am a snob about it so it's probably not that big a deal in the grand scheme of things).  The dolsoht bibimbap was the best I've had in a long long time - there were so many crispy rice parts at the bottom and they give you just the right amount of sauce to put in, and there was bulgogi in it as well!  The highlight of the meal.

The service - impeccable.  We had a nice young guy who was always attentive and there to give us extras of the side dishes, and came by with extra soup as well. 

Overally, I really feel like this restaurant deserves to do well in this city as it delivers quality Korean food at a comparable price to other places, and the experience was a pleasant surprise.  I think they haven't had much buzz due to their location (Asia Towne Center) which even I haven't been to before (and I've been in CLE for 3 years complaining about lack of asian food to eat), and I'm sure there are many other people who haven't heard of this place who would love it as well!"}
{"text":"Horrible services. Serving soup without bowl and spoon. Serving pork belly without lettuce and scissor. Rice came after we finished all the food. Poor experience overall"}
{"text":"Dol sot bi bim bop. With a dish name like this it has to be authentic. Yo it was made out of Beef, bean sprouts, egg yolk, over rice. In a hot stone pot which kept the food at times burning to the tongue. Miso soup was good.  Tea was unique as well. Gave it three stars for now until I eat at the restaurant to check out the service. I would recommend if you are craving authentic Korean BBQ."}
