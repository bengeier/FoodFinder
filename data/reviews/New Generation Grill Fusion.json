{"text":"Seems to serve two purposes:
1. At lunch, VERY reasonable lunch specials. It basically serves as overflow for the original New Gen location across the street - and that's a good thing.
2. At dinner, mostly all-you-can-eat (AYCE), but has the regular a la carte menu too.

AYCE is available at both lunch and dinner, but unlike most places lunch is the same price as dinner ($20.95 Mon-Thu). This might explain why we were seemingly the only ones having AYCE at 1 pm...

Food is pretty good, comparable to other places for AYCE. The butterfish is great, really melts in your mouth. The dragon rolls had almost no shrimp in them, just tempura batter. \"Spicy\" rolls aren't really spicy. New Gen also has some more uncommon items, like chicken karaage, takoyaki (octopus balls), and chicken cartilege (!?).

Service is friendly but as slow as your average AYCE place. A couple of orders were missed. We had to ask for wasabi and pickled ginger, and the portions we got were TINY.

All in all, a worthy member of the Annex sushi strip."}
{"text":"I'm updating this review after about a year and a half.  I continue to be impressed by this place.  We went again tonight, and they have upgraded the decor with some bare wood lattice and an interesting painted mural.  They've done away with the table cooking in favor of more tables and booths.  The menu is still extensive and varied, although I still get the #66 Ume Box every time.  Service continues to be efficient, and food is as fresh and generously portioned as ever.  While most restaurants have either jacked up prices or pared back portions, New Gen has managed to keep everything largely the same - even the free ice cream.  I still leave full and satisfied after having only dropped ten bucks plus tip.  For that, I'm shelling out the elusive fifth star!"}
{"text":"It's interesting to see other reviews that were very positive including it being \"the best korean grill in town\" cause I thought it was absolutely the worst.

To it's credit, I like the physical grills there.  They were hot, and cooked fast.

Not in it's favour:
- Innattentive staff
- Slow service
- Portions of meat brought to the table were very small.  Yes it's all you can eat.  But when the service is shitty, it's more frustrating that you have to keep getting their attention to get more food.
- I had to repeat requests.

If find the service lacking at most Korean BBQ restuarants, and I think many others do to.  But it's usually not so bad that it doesn't outweigh the quality of the food and the good price.
The fact that I was so incensed by the service shows how bad it was.  My dinner companion agreed as well.

I was actually livid by the time my meal was over and glad to leave.  I'll go back to my regular Korean BBQ thanks.

I gave this 1 star only because the food was still ok."}
{"text":"New Generation Grill Fusion... New Generation Sushi... this gives me the same sensation of 'a Starbucks across from a Starbucks' that you find in some large cities (probably somewhere in Toronto as well). You feel as if you should be able to step into some kind of time-warp... anyways, moving on.

I have only ever been for the all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ lunch special (slap the word 'lunch' or 'special' on something, and I'm THERE, baby). Here are my thoughts:

- Can't they just leave a teapot on the table? They need to pour one cup at a time?

- I know it's traditional for waiters/waitresses to take a long-ass time at all-you-can-eat places, but it gets a bit ridiculous. It just got to the point where my group told the server, 'Just bring 3 of each meat, plus a whole bunch of pickles'. If you're going to eat bbq here, make sure you have the time to kick back, relax, and pack it in.

- They need plates bigger than espresso cup saucers for banchan. MORE PICKLES! 

- I did have a sushi lunch special here once, and was really disappointed. Dried-out rice, and the fish had a 'consistency'. It had been sitting 'round a while."}
{"text":"This is my best AYCE sushi restautant since I got Toronto, I've just been here 8mth ago. haha Best reasonable price and delicious sushi for me. I highly recommend to everyone and definitely I'll be there again."}
{"text":"I was here once with few friends and would be last time.
We all had the all-you-can-eat dinner. The food came out look fine but their taste said different stories. We don't expect real sushi in Toronto, but sushi here honestly very low quality, we did not call for second round, just tried to finish our portion.  We first came here and did not wanted to waste food so we called not too many at once but little by little to try out, but the staff seemed not so comfortable everytime we asked to order.
We finished our meal with green tea gelato perhaps the only thing pleasant."}
{"text":"This place is definitely overrated. The food is mediocre and most of the soup are either very salty or too sweet. 
Bad: Very thin slices of salmon sashimi- doesn't taste fresh, short ribs are definitely not the best
Good: most of the maki rolls. Staff are nice."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere, and fantastic food. Totally loved it. Ordered the crystal sashimi plate--so big I couldn't finish it! Four stars!"}
{"text":"We came for AYCE. They need a dedicated host person for prepping tables and seating people. Once we were seated, the service is impressively speedy for a busy spot. All the servers do a good job and the orders came quickly. The menu has lots of options and the portions are small so you can try different things. There are a decent number of vegetarian options. The quality is standard for the location - good enough, but not great. The rolls do have a lot of rice. The only complaint is that some of our maki were warm."}
{"text":"They have an amazing grill buffet! It is a great date night idea because it is a lot of fun! The regular menu is also very good. I go here regularly and I have never been disappointed. The bento box is a great and cheap meal. I usually switch the basic sushi that comes with it for the Unagi or Spicy Salmon. The salad dressing is also the best I have ever had at a sushi restaurant! Always an excellent pick!"}
{"text":"Service is friendly and fast, food is very good for the price. Their bento boxes can feed 2 people easily - I typically get the Teriyaki Chicken bento for lunch and will still have enough left over for dinner. All you can eat options are plentiful as well and quicker to come out than most other AYCE sushi places I've been to."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite location for AYCE but I can't help but realize that your servers are immensely slow when it's a full house or almost. I always end up asking for more tea or water or even for the opportunity to order more."}
{"text":"love love love !! I've only been for lunch (multiple times), but there $6.99 options are so vast. Their rolls are great (I recommend the Tempura and the Spicy Salmon) and another of my favourites is the Udon (amazing), the Bento has great value with the chicken kastu done to perfection.  From what I hear the bibambap and some of the other rice dishes are really great too. Service is average but for cheap eats, what can you expect!"}
{"text":"I have to say that my partner and I went back and the service has completely changed.  There are new waiters who are more quick, friendly and efficient and don't judge us and our big appetites.  Big improvement!  Now I know there is a good sushi place that is affordable and an overall comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"A fail safe and well established place in the annex. There are two new generation restaurants, one on the north side of bloor which is newer, and the original on the south side of bloor. Some people prefer the original new generation but I like the newer one on the north side because the menu has more Japanese food. 

Can't really go wrong with any of the menu items. If you are there early as in before 7pm,there's lots of seats but the place does get very busy with all the students in the area."}
{"text":"I'm trying to be as unbiased as possible, considering that I am not a Korean BBQ fan (not of this variety, anyhow). I came here with 3 other friends who were taking part in the AYCE meat-fest, and so I opted for one of my regular orders of sushi, the Ume Box, from the original New Gen.

To try and convince the server that I was there to have sushi, and not partake in the grill portion was a bit of a challenge. Understandably, they were suspicious - damn those few bad apples who've ruined it for the rest of us non-grillers! After speaking with their manager (dramz!) they finally conceded, though not before requesting that I shift one seat over so that I be completely separated from the rest of the group. Really? Really?! Of course, I ignored that request and went about chomping on my skimming-average sushi to prove a point: yes! I really am NOT going to steal nibble of grilled beef!

The rest of the group seemed to really enjoy the grill though - the beef and kalbi ribs were especially popular, and everyone definitely left with their $15 worth of food. Place was pretty clean, though surprisingly busy come 7:00 on a Friday. 

And there we have it: an averagely written review for a generally average spot in the Annex."}
{"text":"My friend and I went this place at 1ish on Friday. It was not too busy. Service is good and fast. They have fresh salmon, butterfish sashimi, and various rolls that the server recommended me. We liked it. Tbh, their short ribs were a bit salty for me. But It's still the best all you can eat Japanese restaurant so far."}
{"text":"Went here for the $5.99 lunch specials.  Salmon teriyaki, chicken teriyaki, grilled chicken/beef  and some California rolls was ordered.  We found the teriyaki sauce too sweet for our palette - our salmon and chicken were swimming in the sauce.  Miso soup a bit too watery.  Other than that the portions were sufficient, tons of rice, fast service since it wasn't very busy and cheap! 

Their regular menu also has Korean items.  I haven't tried the AYCE grill but for lunch it is only $8.95.

Once I went to their other location on the south side of Bloor which had a line up - they sent us to this location with a flyer that said 10% off."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite AYCE sushi place.  Food is mindfully prepared, very well balanced, sashimi VERY fresh, beef tataki is well aged/marinated and the rolls are perfect temperature, with well combined flavours.
The service was quick and attentive!
For a 4:00 pm on a Sunday, the place was surprisingly full of people with only a few free tables.
We left VERY happy.
The price is reasonable with $25 for weekend dinner and $21-22 for weekday."}
{"text":"Love this place! The fusion roll is delicious. It's casual and you can't beat the lunch special. Best value for sushi in The Annex. This isn't the place to impress a date, but more of a friend spot- or a spot to grab something quick and delicious on a Tuesday night. I haven't had the other food options other than sushi so can't speak to them. If you want fancier sushi or food there are better places but I just love this! Also you get free ice cream and usually soup or salad on the house! :)"}
{"text":"For a long time, Aji Sai was my go to AYCE sushi buffet. However, it wasn't always the most convenient and I was starting to see the decline in quality and decided to try New Generation.

The original New Gen was my go to sushi restaurant when I just wanted a simple bento box. The prices were reasonable and the food tastes great. So before I even tried their AYCE restaurant, I was sure it'd be a sufficient find for an AYCE joint in the downtown area. The sushi was good, pretty fresh and they didn't use too much rice in their Maki rolls thankfully! There were lots of options as well. 

The service was okay. It's not as poor as how others experienced it though. Our food came at a reasonably time, sometimes the waitresses would forget things like spicy mayo or extra wasabi but because we had good conversations going with our group, we were patient. 

When it was starting to get packed, we never felt like the staff was rushing us which we appreciated. If anything, it felt like the people in line were rushing us because they couldn't stop glaring at us! 

I'd come here again if I'm ever in the need for AYCE sushi. If you're in the area, give it a try. It's hard to tell since the reviews are on opposite spectrums!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Despite the fact that the venue is old, the menu was really good. Great selection of sushi. And it was soo delicious! They prepare their own sauces which gives you a chance to rediscover new flavours. Amazing guests services!"}
{"text":"Looking for a late night meal along bloor and found this gem.  Across the street from Green P parking was a plus. Nice decor, great lighting (seriously this would be a great first date spot). As a vegetarian I had TONS of options including appetizers. Food was really good, the tempura could've been a bit more seasoned but soy sauce made up for it. Excellent service as well, and towards midnight as the crowd thinned out, we were offered ice cream on the house (which I accepted, of course). I would definitely return."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant, it has the same great food as New Generation across the street, PLUS Korean grill and the lineup here is always shorter.

I've only had their Korean grill food once or twice, but I've had their rainbow rolls and teriyaki chicken (with the thick sauce) many times and always been satisfied.

Too bad they don't have a third New Generation out in Mississauga or somewhere closer to me. :("}
{"text":"The AYCE sushi was good compared to the other sushi places around town, but was AYCE quality as expected (the fish isn't that great, except salmon). The fried items such as tempura and the fried shrimp was what set New Gen apart from other AYCE sushi places. The service was better than most AYCE sushi places, where they ignore you as time goes on. Would recommend if you are looking for AYCE sushi! but go there a little bit earlier to get seats"}
{"text":"Best Korean Grill in Toronto. Don't miss out stop here if your in the area.

Food is great. Atmosphere is super nice and super clean. Staff are all so pleasant. A lot of the girls who work there are pretty cute too! (Bonus) :P

Bottom line, go eat there next time your planning Korean food!"}
{"text":"The best AYCE in downtown! Love the hokkigai and tamago sushi. The mango fashion sushi is also superb!"}
{"text":"Great taste for an even better price. The Assorted Bibimbap is the best value."}
{"text":"So it's not called New Generation Fusion anymore, and serves up the same menu as New Gen (the original down the street) wih a fancy all you can eat menu ($21.95) 

They fully renovated with sleek modern design reminiscent of Guu but not really. They got rid of the Korean BBQ and the menu is mainly Japanese.

The food is tasty but at a quality that's Bloor street. This isn't to say its not good but not as refined as some other higher end restos. 

We got a Nabeyaki udon and I ordered a bunch I appetizers including Karaage chicken cartilage (which not many restos have)$8.95, beef short ribs $8.95 and spider roll $9.95. 

Reading my last review, they don't have this $10.95 Kalbi Bento anymore, which would have been nice, because all I wanted was short ribs and I could choose from only the appetizer or a $19.95 Short Ribs and Chicken Bento.

It was hard to pick because the menu has all the staple Japanese foods. But also not any different than the resto down the street. Would have been nice if they kept some of the Korean

All meals came with soup salad and free ice cream."}
{"text":"Was craving spider roll and came in since a friend reccomended me. I was really satisfied with the spider roll! I ordered a side of sashimi and they were really thick slices that tasted really fresh! The place was very clean and decor bright and new looking. I was very satisfied with my service. The plus was that even though I did not order a meal I still got a soup and salad with it! So glad my friend recommended me and definitely would like to go back! The place was easy to find and at a super convenient location. Signage was big so it was not a problem looking for a place."}
{"text":"If I had to sum this place up in two words, it would be inconsistent and random. I was drawn into this place based on the hype of their sister company, New Generation Sushi. We were craving sushi, and lets face it, the Annex is filled with tons of random sushi joints. But if I could get my Korean fix while I'm at it, then why not.

The inconsistencies I'm referring to was mostly with our miso soups. One of us had mostly tofu, one of us had mostly seaweed, and one of us had mostly green onion. It wasn't a problem at all. It was just amusing :)

We each ordered a sushi roll, and my friend's dragon roll was more appetizing than my spicy salmon roll (which wasn't all too spicy at all). The dragon roll even came with some salmon sashimi, which was a nice touch.

My two friends ordered two different bento boxes, but we swear that they were practically the same. None of us could recall the difference. And underneath their tempura was a spring roll, which once again, we found amusing :)

I ordered a chicken bibm bahb, which was packed with plenty of chicken. My only disappointment was that the rice was served in a separate bowl, so I had to mix the rice in myself (which didn't give it the crispiness I like). The server was kind enough though, to offer to mix everything herself. As for the hot sauce, it was served in a mustard looking bottle, which, say it with me, we found amusing :)

All in all, we were all satisfied. The servings are huge though, and with each of us getting a sushi roll, it was more than enough food than we could consumer. To top things off, they offered us some ice cream on the house. With their huge servings, cheap prices, and all-around amusingness, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I have been going to New Generation (original location aka \"MurderGen\" - on account of the murder and all) for years until the kid came along and now we're yearning for more space but refuse to defect and go to that bastard location Sushi on Bloor - so we checked out this new location aptly now dubbed \"Non-MurderGen\". 

As far as the food goes, Non-MurderGen is pretty on par with MurderGen, definitely the same sushi menu with some added dishes for the new Korean BBQ menu. And there is definitely space to be had for strollers and such. However what this new location gains in space (and not freezing your ass off in line outside of the original location hoping to God you get a booth and not the bar), it lacks in dish consistency and service. 

Our miso soups were different. I had the seaweed and the hubs had the tofu...we decided to split half of each others. And we had to ask a few times for chopsticks, which one would believe to be fairly standard at a sushi restaurant.

Plus it doesn't have that waiter at this location who remembers who we are and gives us free edamame. No free edamame - no 4th star!!!"}
{"text":"I never ate here during the Korean Grill days or whatever but I went in when the AYCE sushi started as that is my passion in life. Unfortunately, the owners seem to be crazy and thought it would be acceptable to charge $21 for AYCE during lunch on a weekday so I didn't bother (seriously, lunch is available for $9.99 other places, dinner is available for $16.99 some places, the menu or the service certainly don't set this place apart enough to warrant these prices). I ended up getting a lunch special and a tamago handroll. It was identical to the other New Generation place. Rolls were good, rice was well seasoned, no complaints about the sushi portion of the meal. The salad bothered me, though. It was served with a bug on it. When I brought it to the server's attention she didn't seem very concerned or make any effort to make up for it. I don't know how the kitchen even missed it, it was on top of the salad, not like it was buried in the depths. Besides, isn't that why we wash lettuce? Basically consider this place just a second dining room for when the main location is full, there's nothing to make it special."}
{"text":"Overall, a great AYCE experience. We were walking around the Annex and looking for some good sushi.  I saw that Japan Sushi was recommended heavily but was a la carte only and noticed many of the AYCE in the area had a bad rep.  Nevertheless, this location proved it wrong and we had a great time minus some bad patrons (see below)

Food: 4/5, We order tons and the sashimi was on point along with many of their hot dishes (karage and pork cutlets). Note however that some may be pre-done because when it wasn't too busy around 6-7PM, the food was ok but when it got busy, it appeared that they had to make things fresh so the kitchen food was much better (reco to come near 7-8PM but with reservations).  The sushi rolls were smaller in size (all in 8 piece so we were initially worried that we couldn't try a bunch).  The only downside would be that many of the special rolls were not available for AYCE and thus making most maki rolls taste similar.  

Service: 3/5, the waitresses do a really good job despite not no iPad or paper ordering system.  You have to tell them what you want.  This makes it a little difficult to decide what to order AND because the AYCE menu is just a list without description, it wasn't easy to figure out what was what. There were some bad patrons: two guys sitting beside us obviously ordered way too much and tried to make an excuse that the food was bad so that they weren't charged.  The manager came over and said that it was ok and the patrons won't be charged but told them not to keep saying the food was bad because that wasn't the case.  I thought this was done professionally.

Ambience: 3/5, Just typical seating and quiet overall.  Nothing spectacular but nothing bad either.

Price: 3/5, Typical AYCE pricing; around $35 per person.  They should however NOT charge $1 for hot tea."}
{"text":"Chaotic waiting system. They would rather have empty tables waiting for people who don't show up for 10+ minutes, than seating customers standing in line waiting. Understaffed. Unpredictable wait time , stay away"}
{"text":"This is downtown Toronto's best kept secret for ayce sushi. For $24.99, we got to eat wide variety of rolls including torched salmon, lobster (Canadian roll), salmon roe (pacific roll), etc. Their appetizers are also very yummy, our favorite was the kalbi ribs.

However, some items were a clear miss. Our sweet potato fries were overly salted and peppered unequally sliced sweet potatoes that were then fried to a mush but not crispy state. 

The wait is very long so make sure you make an rsvp before showing up on weekends."}
{"text":"Came here for ayce lunch over the Easter weekend. 

First off ordering is taken by the server. No iPad or menu sheet ordering like other places. This made for a slow service. 

Generally food was average. Ratio of protein to rice in both their maki and nigiri leaned towards more rice. Rice was bland and lacked 'hold'. Maki and nigiri easily fell apart when picked up with chopsticks.  Tempura shrimp were on the small side. Sashimi choices were very limited for a weekend ayce. Lastly presentation and plating was haphazard. Considering the price charged I felt overall it wasn't value for money."}
{"text":"Food was good
Yet service was subpar. Several orders did not go through and this may have been on purpose. Many expensive dishes were not brought. Even when it was brought it took a rather long time."}
{"text":"Finally managed to get our hear for some Korean BBQ last week. It was actually the first time for a lot of us, so I don't have anything to compare it to. I will say that the staff was friendly and the food was delicious.

Sadly, most of my dining companions weren't particularly adventurous, so I didn't get the chance to try some of the more interesting items (squid, liver, etc.). There's definitely a good selection of items to suit every palate.

Definitely looking forward to a return visit!"}
{"text":"The sushi is okay. But every time I go there I  feel nausea. The avocado rolls are amazing. The service is good."}
{"text":"This is my friend's spot for AYCE in the city so we went here a few days ago.  Neither of us were particularly hungry so we decided to skip the AYCE and order off the lunch specials ($7.99).   We got the spicy tuna rolls, an order of their udon soup and salmon don don.

I didn't care for the salmon dish - it lacked flavor but I will say the portion size is huge and you get lots of salmon.  Lots!

The spicy tuna was actually spicy and I loved the flavourful broth of the soup.  

Service is friendly and quick and they are always busy.  We went for a late lunch and it was still pretty packed with people continuing to stream in."}
{"text":"New Generation is my go-to for my weekly sushi fix. This newly-renovated location fits perfectly with their improved lunch menu, and now they're offering all you can eat as well. Though I haven't tried the all you can eat yet, I can definitely vouch for the lunch menu - it is definitely the best quality value for your money in Toronto, and the servers are very friendly which is a nice plus."}
{"text":"Ambiance & aesthetics: The establishment is pretty modern. Maybe play a bit of modern japaneae music to suit the theme of the store, however the entrance to the washrooms might need a retouch

Food: Absolutely tasty. Their shrimp butter yaki, their kanikama and deep fried chicken catilage have reached my wildest expectations, all other foods are indeed a delight.

People/servers: At first they where slow to find seats for me however once the orders are set they are prompt and very clean.

4.75/5"}
{"text":"This review is only for the \"Sushi\" part of the menu.

How does a restaurant owned by the same people, with the same menu, and the same prices be so different?

We passed by New Generation down the street, and didn't feel like witing in line [a line that always seems to be there ... take that as a hint people].  I remembered that New Gen Fusion had the same menu, so we decided to try it out.

Menu is the same, but they also have a Korean BBQ menu.  Half the resto seemed to be eating from the Japanese menu, and the other half from the Korean menu.

We split the Take Box.
Salad - standard [... doesn't regular New Gen put a tomato in there? .. can't rember]
Miso Soup - Tepid. If miso soup isn't almost boiling hot, what's going on.
Beef Teriyaki - Looked ok, but tasted a little like it was reheated or steamed.boiled in some way.
Tempura - Half hot and half warm. Again, tempura that's not hot isn't worth serving.
Gyozo dumpling - good.
Sushi upgrade - have't had it before, so don't know if we didn't like this one or this type in general.

Summary:
Maybe the kitchen had a severely off day. Or maybe I'll try the Korean BBQ and cook the food myself next time."}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi place I've ever tried. Fresh sushi/sashimi and Awesome services. Their servers are extremely friendly and helpful. Their miso soup and green tea ice cream also worth it. Relatively nice washroom as well."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at New Generation! The food is good and comes with soup, salad and ice cream on the house! What more could you want? The service is good but the lines are long so you'll probably want to call ahead! I highly recommend the the steak teriyaki (#120). Perfect date spot!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I were super hungry so we ordered 3 lunch specials: sushi (butterfish and salmon), chicken udon, chicken donburi. All were excellent.

The sushi - 4.5 stars. butterfish literally melted in my mouth. the salmon was standard but good. All in all the sushi tasted very fresh.

Chicken udon - 4.5 stars. the grilled chicken udon was a blast of flavor

Chicken donburi - 4 stars 

Service was excellent as well as the price. For $30 (3 lunches plus 20% tip) 2 madly hungry people were happily and completely stuffed."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch on a Tuesday.  Not that busy around 1:00pm.  They have a decent lunch menu for $5.99 which includes miso soup and green salad.  The miso was a bit watery and the green salad was cut up lettuce and dressing.

I order the bento box with chicken (or beef) and it was a decent size.  It was sliced chicken instead of the usual slab.  The bento came with rice, veg tempura and 3 pieces of salmon maki.  I was actually full.

I'd come back to try the all you can eat korean BBQ next time.  For $9, it seems like a great deal - chicken, beef, fish and squid with lots of side dishes."}
{"text":"We went for dinner day and I ordered the makimono set c which came with spicy tuna, unagi and california. The maki were a pretty good size however they were too chewy and the ingredients seemed to be old (yellow avocado???). The spicy tuna itself was the best of all if i had to pick one but i would not say that it was above average.
Overall i would give 2 stars for food
 
3 stars for cleanliness. The front door of the restaurant was digustingly dirty. 

4 stars for the service- very polite and friendly servers and managent.
The manager even gave us a free ice cream at the end of the dinner. However, I wouldnt go back because the of the food which is the most important when I visit a restaurant."}
{"text":"Someone from Vancouver, living in the6 
I think they have good quality sushi with reasonable price!
Bon appetite !"}
{"text":"Service is extremely rude - waitress would not call over a manager when we needed to escalate and complain to someone. I would definitely not recommend this place, specially when there are other much better places in town."}
{"text":"If you want AYCE sushi just for the sake of stuffing yourself with sushi, appetizers, and sashimi: go to New Gen. Boyfriend and I love AYCE more than the average person and we can eat A LOT. After hitting up every AYCE sushi on Bloor, New Gen is definitely our favorite now. We went there on a Saturday night which was a full house. Despite it being busy, we got our orders in a timely manner and the biggest perk was that they never missed a single order from us even though they take orders by jotting it down on a notepad unlike other AYCE! I swear to god we ordered over a hundred pieces of salmon sashimi and they were on point with the thickness and count."}
{"text":"Cute and quiet place for the most part depending on the time and what not. 
Anyways, my friends and I came here Friday night for dinner. Wasn't too busy or packed until later around 8ish. 


Plenty of items to pick from on their menu including that from their all you can eat options.  The options are quite large and filling so order carefully because you may have more food on your table then you expected.  The food was fresh enough and their seaweed salad option is HUGE which is a favourite of time. 

The servers are nice and attentive

Definitely a place to check out if it's all you can eat."}
{"text":"AYCE sushi is usually good to me and this one is no different. The food was fresh and tasted amazing! especially their sashimi :) but my favourite was the takoyaki! The only downside is that they didn't have pictures of their menu and I believe the cost of dinner on the Sunday I went, was 27$. It's a bit pricey and does not compare to other AYCE sushi places, I love sushi and I could name a few other ones that I'd recommend over new generation. Although it is a good place, I think they have some pretty big competition, only cause I've been to ones I've liked more."}
{"text":"Food was great and the service was even better thanks to Charles.  Will return forsure!!"}
{"text":"My all time favourite sushi place in Toronto. Love the spread and always fresh. Extensive menu choices for all you can eat. Try the ribs and don't forget green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"Much like many of the other Korean BBQ joints in town, New Gen's take on AYCE grill is busy! Maybe it was just me, but I didn't think that it was as smelly here as many of the other places. Perhaps this is because we were sitting right by the door and the constant line-up kept the cold air flowing which wafted the intense aroma out. 

It's admittedly been years since I've visited any other Korean BBQ, but the portions seemed smaller. This is a good thing in my books since our eyes inescapably prove to be bigger than our stomachs. 

The servers were extremely friendly and returned often to replenish not just our water and tea (to fill us up), but meats and side dishes as well."}
{"text":"I love AYCE sushi and thought I'd try this place for dinner.

The food was ok. I didn't like the fact that the rolls had so much rice in them that I was full after a few dishes. I usually like to try a lot of dishes. I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"For what you pay for, it's not too bad. Service is fast. And when it's busy, it's not a place you want to sit and catch up. It feels like being in a restaurant in Hong Kong. The efficiency of them from taking your orders to serving you your food, clearing the plates and bringing your bill is faster than speed of light! 
The sushi roll made was abit too loose that when I used my chopsticks to pick it up, the till started to fall apart which got quite messy."}
{"text":"A solid 5 star experience at New Generation Grill Fusion. Came an hour late for my Buddys birthday because parking isn't guaranteed when you arrive in the area. Took an extra 40 mins finding parking plus it was raining, parked 2 blocks down the road and walked up even tho there is a Green P right in front of the joint, thats how it goes. I was actually surprised that they still had my buddy save the seats even tho there was a huge line up when we arrived. The washroom is down the stairs and isn't as sketchy as some other places when you take the stairs down just to wash your hands. 

Our waitress was on POINT! Performance exceeded any expectations I had about this place. She was fun and smiled and made us all feel very comfortable. 

THE FOOD! I forgot what it was called on the menu but it was like fried chicken nuggets which were BOMB! the best thing I tasted at any sushi spot, it deserves the 5 star because of the chicken alone, we also got the assorted sushi platter which was delicious but it has cream cheese in one of them which I loved. if your not a fan of cream cheese in the sushi I wouldn't suggest getting it. Everything else I enjoyed and the ice-cream they had ginger ice-cream! lol so its only right that I get that"}
{"text":"Amazing AYCE with high quality sashimi, sushi, salads, kalbi, and more. Everything we tried was delicious. Don't bother with the desserts, just gorge on the protein."}
{"text":"Went there last night as a group of 4 adults. Service was fast and very friendly, the restaurant wasn't very busy as it was after 10:30pm so we were seated right away nice and far from the front door. We had a bento box, some sushi/sashimi and a veggie udon soup. I received an unexpected complimentary green salad and miso soup with my rainbow maki! We were there up until midnight and despite the fact that they were closing and we were the last customers they offered to top up our teas after our meal was finished! How many restaurants do that? The food portions are generous and reasonably priced. The tables have the cooking unit underneath which makes it pretty uncomfortable (and I\"m only 5'2\") and the place is a bit cramped overall but everybody enjoyed their meal and we will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I love their sushi here, always delicious, one of my favorite AYCE japanese restaurants. Try the salmon and tuna sushi - excellent servings"}
{"text":"Last night was the first time I've been in this New Gen location. It's sleeker than the other, and there was an intimidating line at Sushi On Bloor so we landed on New Generation after a 30 minute spring stroll towards this almighty strip of cheap sushi. 

The decor and AYCE here will definitely get me back her again. Cartoon Godzilla? Cool. $20 all-you-can-eat dinners with a fairly extensive menu? Cooler. Last night I opted for Maki Set B and some gyozas and it was far too much food, and I enjoyed it immensely, especially the spicy tuna rolls. 

In closing, this location is great because it was never closed for murder. Remember that? How could you forget murder..."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi standbys. Unreal lunch specials. $6.99 for everything and lots of choices. The quality is always on point too! Great AYCE with a group or regular menu on your own. 

I always come back to here!"}
{"text":"All you can eat!!!! This was the highlight of my vacation. This place has Korean BBQ and sushi. Best combination ever!!!!! If we were waiting for the meat to come to our table or wait till it is cooked, we would eat the raw salmon while we wait. for desert there was a selection of red bean, green tea, or mango ice cream. YUM!!!! This place is good!!!!"}
{"text":"All you. Can eat is the best deal go 21 bucks. We go hungry there eat as much as we can . The sushi is really great taste. The all u can eat used to be 18 bucks and some times 16 on off hours"}
