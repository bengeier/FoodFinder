{"text":"I hadn't been back to Stadium Grill in probably a year so thought I must of stepped into some sort of Time Machine when I walked in last night and saw Tony there again serving food & acting like the owner, like he did when he WAS the owner, well Déjà vu he bought it back.  Great atmosphere, new owners, new menu and an attentive and helpful staff.  If you haven't been in a while you need to def check it out. I'm rating a 4 only because wasn't there long enough to really form an opinion but at first look I liked what I saw. Once I've been a few times its certainly possible my rating could improve.  http://www.stadiumbargrill.com/  Tony also owns the Sunset Grill in Fairport Harbor, another great spot however I think its only open seasonally? http://sunsetharborgrille.com/"}
{"text":"I like Stadium a lot and the food is great.  They have darts and a pool table too.  Great place to watch a Browns or Cavs game."}
{"text":"I went there last week and was beyond impressed about the food. This is Mentor's little secret and you can't beat the prices. My suggestion is to go right to their specials. Very pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"the owner is never not wasted they run out of my drink every time i have gone and the liquor selection  is a joke for a bar of its size they cant even make common shots or drinks the only thing good about this place is the karaoke on sundays by sound styles unlimited"}
{"text":"Finally I can give this place a great review again!! With the new management bringing all the old favorites back and keeping it good bar food I'm ready and willing to keep coming back! Thank you for bringing back the prime rib, thank you for wonderful yummy potato skins, and thank you for being good bar food again!"}
{"text":"Have eaten their food twice. The first time we dined in. I had a burger and fries, my son had garlic parm wings and my fiancé had a burger and an order of 6 thai chile wings. The food wasn't bad. Service was just okay. My burger was a little dry and I was thankful the waitress suggested I get a wing sauce to go with it. We usually taste each other's food, so I tried their wings. Didn't like the garlic parm wings, the Thai ones were okay, however swimming in bottled sauce. Fries were handcut and good.   Second time eating here, we ordered our food to go. We live less than 10 minutes away. I ordered the ultimate nachos (appetizer) and a 5-piece Thai chile wings, fiancé ordered Kobe burger and fries and shark bite wings, son ordered garlic parm wings. I requested my nachos without olives, even stressing that and of course my nachos came with about 80 of them all over. The tortilla chips were over browned and some were burned on the edges. The ground beef was dry, flavorless and burned. The cheese sauce tasted like Cheese Whiz. It was simply unedible and it went into the garbage because no one liked it. The Thai wings again were drowning in sauce, one of my wings was burnt. I tried my fiancé's Kobe burger and it didn't taste any better than their regular hamburgers. The shark bite wings (spicy ranch) were bland and not very saucy compared to the Thai.   Overall I don't think we will be eating there anytime soon and if we do try this place again, it would definitely NOT be takeout."}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone here for every football game for two years. Their food is actually really good. All the staff are very nice and accommodating. Always have good beer and good times. Restrooms are clean as well as the rest of the bar. Sound system and tv's are excellent quality. The couches are super comfy, albeit a little old and warn.  If I were to complain about anything, it would be there seems to be no more buffet for Browns games."}
{"text":"We stopped by the Stadium Grill for a softball meet and greet. We had a few drinks and the prices are about average. The Barmaid was very attentive, funny and quick to make your drinks. We had a great time while there."}
{"text":"Usually absolutely reliable...worth it for their lunch specials...just started a \"no changes\" rule on their specials--so, if you don't want onions, for example?  Too bad.  You have to pick them off... This should NEVER happen at a restaurant...Deduct one star...free popcorn...serviceable outdoor patio...no wi-fi :( ...$1 burgers on Mondays for lunch..."}
{"text":"I have never been to drink or eat before, I went to this location for the first time tonight for a wedding reception, & all I have to say is how in the hell can this place charge $2.50 for a can of generic pop?! A 2 liter of regular named brand such as Pepsi or Coke is cheaper! & I know it wasn't the bride & groom charging those crazy ass prices because I asked if they supplied beverages and alcohol & they said no it's the bar. Absolutely outrageous, I will not even attempt to go eat there now in the future just because of this experience. Not to mention the bartender had sneezed into her hand and used the same exact hand to grab the can of pop, without washing her hands, & she grabbed it from the top, not the bottom. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"It's not horrible, but nothing special either. The napkin dispenser on the table was sticky with dried sauce and that always turns me off pretty quick. The staff was friendly and accommodating to our large group.  The beer selection is seriously lacking for the type of establishment they're trying to be, which I'm guessing is sports bar. I tried the wine my girlfriend ordered and it was awful. There wasn't any vanilla flavor to my vanilla vodka and ginger ale, so I'm guessing there wasn't much in there.   The fries were really good as was the pepperoni roll app. It was a tad greasy, but oozing with cheese and so delicious! The chicken fingers say they're homemade. They weren't bad, but not good. The chicken was a tiny bit over done and the breading didn't stay on so I ended up eating slightly dry chicken breast with fried breading on the side.  There isn't really anything much healthy offered on the menu.   The atmosphere is kinda divey which I dont mind if you give me something worth coming to, I just didn't experience that here. I would go back if I had a reason, but not by choice. I hope others have more impressive visits!"}
{"text":"Best wings around. Huge selection of sauces or dry rubs. Last time I went I had the Cajun Garlic wings, they were amazing. They also have a great selection of sandwiches, burgers, sides, and salads. Very nice menu for a bar! Good service, decent prices. Thursday's ladies night, so if you're a girl you get 4 free drinks. They also have live bands on Saturday nights. And they have a lot of nice flat screen TVs that always have a game on, and I expect nothing less from a sports bar. Great place. I can't say enough good things! But I really go for the wings. (And the 4 free drinks... I'm kind of a lush)."}
{"text":"I had a one-night trip to Mentor and had zero idea where to eat.  I try to find a locally-owned place, so the reviews in here led me to Stadium Grill.  I was skeptical as I drove up, as it is in a shopping complex.  If you are looking for frills, they have none.  Basic decor.  Jukebox.  Dart board.    What they had was simple, surprisingly good food.    The menu is limited - apps, salads, sandwiches, burgers.  They had daily specials which sounded great, but I went simple:  Turkey wrap and fries.  Both were actually GREAT - which is unexpected.  Great tomatoes.  Bacon was crispy and fresh. Fries were hot and seasoned but not overwhelmed.  Server was a local who was fun and sweet.  Drinks never got empty."}
{"text":"Got the lunch ribeye special ... Asked for medium rare got medium well ... It was still good but waitress never asked if it was cooked right ... Fries were delish tho ...Service was otherwise quick and friendly... but the place was dead all things considered"}
{"text":"They took the french dip off the menu :( but they made me one special :) They have amazing french dips.  Great place, great service!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I went here yesterday for the first time was blown away by the customer service, promptness, and variety and quality of the food.   The atmosphere is typical dive bar, but where they lack in decor they excel in service!  Best chicken wings in Northeast Ohio.  Thirty wing flavors and a relatively inexpensive Tuesday night wing price.  Avoid their two hottest flavors -- they will kill your mouth!   Fresh cut fries also a good value!"}
{"text":"Good neighborhood bar. Bartenders very nice. Decent draft selection. Prices fair. Food pretty good. I tried the Cajun chicken mac and cheese yesterday. Huge portion, and they do not skimp on the cheese. Maybe a little heavy on the sauce but tasted great. They have live music on weekends, local cover bands."}
{"text":"I can't find a better burger in Lake County, and it isn't for lack of trying.  Just simple, good food.  Can get a bit loud at night, but pleasant enough inside.  Down one star because they got rid of the free wifi."}
{"text":"This place has definitely gone downhill. I walked in and seated myself to a fairly busy bar and only a few occupied tables. It took them ten minutes to acknowledge me once I sat down. The waitress/bartender brought out the overpriced $9 grilled cheese sandwich I ordered, and never came back to check on me. The owner was obviously more preoccupied with drinking at the bar with the customers, than he was with acting like an owner, since no one even bothered to bring me the check. Congratulations Stadium Grill, you're officially a dive bar. I will NEVER go back, and tell EVERYONE about the bad experience."}
{"text":"My friend & I went there to listen to a band play, The Stone Pony. Great live band, very very loud, but you kinda expect that with live music.     We had the nachos appetizer...let me tell you, 4 people can easily share that, it was a standard chips with a nacho sauce, meat tasted liked the canned chili, jarred jalapeños. For my entree I got the chicken parmesan sandwich & fries.....the memory of the sheer deliciousness of that sandwich & fries is making my mouth water....and that was 2 weeks ago we went there!!  My friend loved the wrap & fries she had as well! The only unfortunate thing that happened.....We loaded up on nachos & were stuffed to the gills by the time we got our food, LOL. The chicken was moist, perfectly seasoned, crispy, juicy...best chicken parmesan I've had anywhere, hands down!! 2 words: Fair Fries!! Super crispy, delicious, super hot & not at all greasy!  I happily feasted on my leftovers with myl grandson when he awoke from thunder at 1am & at 3 yrs old....he kept saying \"yummy for my tummy Nanna!\"   We will be returning, the adults that is"}
{"text":"Funny how my review seems to have disappeared. I guess negative reviews aren't allowed. Just gave the facts."}
