{"text":"10/10 everything. There's isn't one item that isn't amazing. Sends my taste buds in a journey every time I eat anything from Bruno's"}
{"text":"Salad was really great antipasto. Very fresh and lots of meat and cheese. Pizza was loaded with toppings. Chicken parm was a nice way to round out our dinner. First time here and won't be the last. Staff all said hi and seemed very interested in making sure I had a good night. Carried out. I am saving that last star for my dine in experience."}
{"text":"First off this is a dine in experience and only one visit. I had the Turkey and cheese sandwich. For about 8$ for lunch. Not a bad value at all. I was stuffed. I was served quickly and really enjoyed the sandwich. To dine in it is hot. Not sit there and sweat like crazy hot but still warm. A customer actually said \"wow it's actually a little cooler in here today\" while I was eating.  Seats are uncomfortable. No restroom. My plate was obviously a little old and had some pizza sauce stains in the cut marks. Good food and good service +++ atmosphere and comfort --"}
{"text":"We are done with Bruno's! I was just accused of trying to get a free pizza! Their food has went so far down hill, and the owner is a jerk! Our pizza had such a scant amount of cheese the toppings couldn't stay on. I politely called to tell them this and the owner yelled at me and said I was trying to get s free pizza. We spend plenty of money there and tip  much more than necessary. Also the lettuce in our salad was brown and the onions were translucent with age. There wings are the worst I've ever had and their ravioli are canned sauce over Costco frozen ravioli. Straighten up Bruno's!"}
{"text":"We got 2 xlg cheese pizzas, we went and got them and the pizza was the best I've had here since moving to az.  The dough was awesome and the pizza was even better cold. I love cold pizza. So over all it was a very good place totally recommend trying."}
{"text":"Used to be ok...pizza was over cooked...bread sticks not good tried giving to the dog but just looked at me. Over all last time I order there. We had to go out to eat because it was just that bad."}
{"text":"I am from New York so you know I am super picky about food and my 300 pound stature lets you know I enjoy my food when I get it. So when I say this place is like home, you know this will be food legends are made from. IMHO it does not matter what you order, you will enjoy the meal like no other before. Priced right & they deliver!"}
{"text":"Can you say AMAZING!!! Twice baked Sicilian pizza, delicious wings, and great staff. You know those places that feel like everybody knows your name? The owner was THAT welcoming. I have a feeling this is my next home when it comes to pizza and wings."}
{"text":"I love Bruno's Pizza. They Deliver or sit in their comfortable, clean restaurant. 
The pizza and pasta is freshly made. They have a huge variety of food. Great atmospbere."}
{"text":"I slept on this place, for many years.  Glad I took a chance, they use Roma cheese, that in itself is all you need to know about the quality of this pizza.  Reasonable prices for a perfectly crafted new york/italian pie.  The crust has snap, the sauce is on point, and is not overly grease.  Definitely a pizza gem in the west valley."}
{"text":"great food loved going here the staff will talk and laugh with you not too bad prices"}
{"text":"Pizza is not bad.  I like that it's independently owned and not run by a corporation.  Clean inside and the Guy at the counter was very nice.   I just got the pizza but I would go back to try other things."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious. Wings were good. They gave us plates. Food was made in a timely matter. My wife loved the place. We might go back just for her. I liked it but I have another favorite pizza place. Nothing wrong with this one. The place does look a little old fashion. Other than that, it's great."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in town. The Sicilian pizza is the best. It can feed my gf and I for 3-4 meals. I highly suggest it if you like a thick crusted pizza"}
{"text":"This place is beyond delicious! My husband is from Boston and so it's hard for him to find a real legit east coast style pizza. We were told to try this place and have chosen this place ever since! Their pizza is very good as well as their wings! We would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Me and my boyfriend come here often and they always remember us and are so welcoming and friendly! They have amazing food definitely the best wings I've ever had! :)"}
{"text":"Let's be realistic, this place will deliver, maybe later than excepted by an hour or so maybe for more than expected by a few bucks and may not be open as late as they claim by 20 min or so. If you're hungry go ahead and give them a try for their specials. The quality is general and typical. Not a problem if you're not in a hurry and just ordering pizza and wings"}
{"text":"Best pizza on the west side!! Wings are great too, can't wait to come back and try all the different items on the menu."}
{"text":"Another delicious meal from Bruno's in Peoria.  Not a fancy place, but the owners do a great job.  Thank you Ben and Leila, we appreciate you - and look forward to returning for another great meal in the near future!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Ordered take out tonight.  Medium pizza and 12 wings special. Decently priced. Actually tasted good. Looked good, smelled good on the drive home. We are pretty hard to please when it comes to pizza and wings. Will order again in the future."}
{"text":"We ordered from here for the first time We ordered it for delivery. The person answering the phone was very friendly I assume he was the owner. We got the XL pizza and wings special. Pizza was with light sauce with extra cheese and pepperoni. The wings were extra crispy extra sauce. Everything arrived in a timely fashion and was made to order. The driver was really friendly and nice. We will be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I usually love this place, but I just ordered 20 wings and not only did it take way longer than I was told, but there are 20 drumsticks and that's it. All drumsticks! Who does that!?"}
{"text":"We are pizza freaks and we love this place. Yay small businesses! Always do pick up though."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered a Cheese Pizza with a side of mild wings. The crust is crispy and everything is delicious. Nice alternative to a pizza chain. We will without a doubt will be back and recommend it to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Great food his pasta dishes are great! Thanks Bruno!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Phoenix! I always go in for a slice and the fried zucchini bites with ranch dip. Freaking delicious! The staff is also very attentive, polite and sweet :)"}
{"text":"I was raised on New York pizza and taught my kids how to make it themselves because almost anywhere else it's just not worth the time and money. Times have changed (a little) and there are pizzerias outside that tri-state region where a decent pizza can be had. Bruno's is a solid OK and well above most here in Arizona. If you know anything about pizza, you know the simpler the better. A margherita pizza is pretty much the starting place but most pizza throwers have no idea what you're talking about or at least have no idea how to make one. We stick with Bruno's cheese pizzas. We're not regular feeders on this type fare but maybe once a month..."}
{"text":"I had our lunch delivered!! Delicious! 2 personal pepperoni pizzas, fried mushrooms, sausage calzone, and spaghetti with meat balls!! Everyone enjoyed it and plenty of leftovers for later!!!"}
{"text":"Being from the northeast Boston area... This place is the closest I've found to authentic new York pizza absolutely delicious 2 thumbs up!!!! And reasonable pricing $$"}
{"text":"I'm back in AZ again this week and just had some pretty dang good pizza. 12 of us filtered into this place and they handled that pretty well. you order at the counter, prices are decent, calzones are gigantic, the pizza was huge, and my sandwich was good. the beer was flowing like wine. 

i'm sleepy

and boring"}
{"text":"Let me say the takeout and fast food I've gotten in the past has almost always been a let down. Bruno's is anything but a let down. Restaurant quality food... even better portions at cheaper prices. Freshly made food with no cutting corners using a microwave! My grandma is very picky and she even enjoyed this place. I can say I'll be ordering from here often and $2 delivery is the cherry on top. I appreciate the time and effort they put into their cooking. My picky grandmother would like to add that the only negative was a little too much salt in the calzone."}
{"text":"heck no, expensive and gross. Cardboard XP wings were not good either, i'd rather eat little ceazers... it was that BAD!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, I am from northeast NJ, always on the hunt for good pizza, and I need to tell you guys that this place is awesome!!!!  I'm nearly certain this is the best place I've tried in the west valley, and certainly at least as good as any of the great pizza I've had at some places in Scottsdale.  On top of having exceptional pizza, the staff is unbelievably sweet and the shop is really cute!!  I think it would be a really cozy place to dine in, while staying casual.  I definitely can't wait to come here again, and I would recommend this place to anybody!"}
{"text":"Bruno's
Love the pizza guys...But your chicken parm dinner not so hot...you are not suppose to use chicken nuggets..it should be a chicken breast..stick to whacha know...PIZZA!!"}
{"text":"Bruno is a liar! He messed up my order and delivery driver spent close to an hour and a half trying to find my place then I called and complained and not just once but 4 times. Do not come here."}
{"text":"Best wings I have ever had. Love that it is a family fun business and they are friendly. Restaurant is cute and a perfect spot for a first date. Love that you can buy wings in large quantities as well for a great price. This has become my go to spot for wings."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Brunos many times, it is quite close to my home and the food is enjoyable. I usually get a calzone sometimes the Jalepeno poppers. Good customer service and fast food prep times. I call my order in and its ready 15-20 minutes later. Delivery is 3rd party and can be slow, at times taking more than one hour, I pick it up myself now as I like my food fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Friendly owners and the helpings are more than generous. The pizza is bomb with plenty of cheese and the calzones are HUGE. Bigger than the plate! This will always be a favorite spot of ours."}
{"text":"Another Yelp success story!  I've been looking for a neighborhood pizza and wings place and finally found it!  I'm very particular about my wings and happy that they measure up!  The pizza is great too and the antipasto salad is just right.  Add delivery and Bruno's saves me from cooking dinner!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and there food is taking a turn for the wort. There pizza is good, but terrible reheated. There wings are the worst I've ever had. Way over cooked and little flavor. You can't eat inside and have a beer because the owner keeps the air off. I called to complain and they didn't even care to rectify the situation. No more Bruno's for the Abril family."}
{"text":"I just moved here to AZ and I found out this amazing restaurant. I like their Pizzas  and the food is very delicious . I go there like 3 times a week. The place is super clean and very comfortable to sit and enjoy dinner they also have outstanding pasta dishes this is the best pizza in the valley."}
{"text":"I WANT to love this place! Owner seems cool and it's local/private but the food is hit or miss no better than the average Rays Pizza and like it's been said before delivery SUCKS"}
{"text":"This place is small yet comfortable for my nephew and I. Felt like we were at home watching the suns game and eating pizza.

The owner was so nice. I had asked him politely if she could put on this end game, instead. She handed me the remote control like I was family. Haha. She said whatever you need let me know.  Thumbs up.

I ordered the ziti mushroom pasta, Holy cow they put way too much sauce in!!! Which was PERFECT!!! :)) it also came with a house salad and breadsticks. If I knew, I wouldn't have ordered the vegetarian pizza. But either way, the pizza was fantastic :) minus rhe olives. .. ( I said no olives) :/ 

We'll be coming back. :))"}
{"text":"Good pizza and superior cheese. Great value especially the lunch special. I love their steak and mushroom sandwich and think their wings are a cut above. Nice owners. Love to sit and talk as they are Big soccer fans."}
{"text":"I come here all the time for the lunch special 2 slices and a drink for $3.99 this is the best pizza on my side of town."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the pizza is fresh every time, the employee is very nice which for me is very important when eating somewhere. Nice that there are 2 tv's on different channels, best thing is I live in walking distance."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Its so hard to find places with such fresh toppings. And that serves you with Glass dishes and real silverware! The workers were so nice also. I had no idea i lived this close to such a great pizza shop. I will definitely  come back. And highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I quite frequently use the laundromat next door to Bruno's and I've often thought about going in to check out their restaurant. I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the outside but I was pleasantly surprised. It's a pretty decent locally owned Italian restaurant and pizza place! 
I can't speak to the pizzas, I haven't tried them yet and I eventually will try them. But I have ordered the fish and chips twice and was happy with it. I like that I can order a smaller size, two piece fish and chips, it's just the right amount for one person. Fish wasn't too greasy and fries were good. They also have a very good cocktail sauce that you can have instead of the tartar sauce. I have also tried their tiramisu which was really delicious! One of the best tiramisu's that I have had. There's lots of variety on the menu. 
I've only ordered for carry out, I've never tried the delivery service. The interior of the restaurant was nice... casual dining with booths. The one thing that struck me about Bruno's was that it seemed very clean. The chef actually wears a white chef's outfit which was clean and the food prep area also looked clean and well kept. 
Bruno's is in a very small strip mall next door to the Coinless laundromat. Don't let the outward appearance of the strip mall steer you away from Bruno's. I feel like it's a safe area. 
Bruno's is a great choice for inexpensive meals and good food. I'm looking forward to trying their pizza next time I am there."}
{"text":"*Pizza is about Arizona average or a bit above. I liked the crust 

*Great lunch deal though- 2 slices and drink for 4.99

*Advice- please turn off politics on TV for those who want a relaxing lunch."}
{"text":"Holy crap. This place is so good. I wandered in here on a surprise dinner day with my fiancé after I got out of my class. I was super surprised by the décor very very nice despite being in a trip.  We ordered for carry out but once we saw  the place we thought we'd sit down. Even though they were starting to close they didn't mind at all. They went as far as to bring us plates, silverware, and water completely unprompted. The pizza itself? So. Freaking. Good. The sauce especially. 
I have driven past this place over and over again the past year while on my way to school. They've been here for 21 years. So glad I finally stopped."}
{"text":"The calzone special was wonderful. Best I have ever had. The sausage was flavorful with the sauce and the melted cheese really made the combo. Fresh and tasty. I had to come back for more so now I am trying their homemade lasagna. You have to try this place. You won't be disappointed."}
