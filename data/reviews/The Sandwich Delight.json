{"text":"The service is fast paced and can come across rude, but they have their routine and it works.The have lunch specials, made to order sandwiches and the rockin'-ist salad bar you'll ever try. Think Pizza Hut in the 80's but 100 times better. 

the balsamic dressing is to die for...."}
{"text":"Solid little cash-only joint.

$3 all-in gets you a breakfast sandwich and a coffee. The breakfast sandwich is made fresh to order, and oh so tasty.

Can't beat that, jerks."}
{"text":"Solid lunch take-out spot tucked away on a side street across from Women's College Hospital. It gets packed at lunch hour with people from all the surrounding offices (hospital, MaRS, government) but the manager runs a tight ship -- the line moves fast and they always get your order right. 

Great selection: daily hot specials (e.g. lasagna Thursday's), made to order sandwiches, and the main event -- the salad bar. I like that it's self-serve so you can include exactly what you want. The selection is decent, although not as extensive as nearby Est West at College/University. They usually have: mixed greens, chicken penne salad, seafood spagetti salad in cream sauce, potato salad, quinoa salad, plus lots of add ons (egg, firm tofu, nuts, shredded cheddar, cottage cheese, fruit). Prices are really reasonable. For a hot entree and side salad, it's $5.99.

Very little seating -- just a counter with about 5 stools."}
