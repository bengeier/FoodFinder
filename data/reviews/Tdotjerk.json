{"text":"Good curry goat and jerk chicken. Not special, but the only Caribbean joint on Roncy, so it is a welcome establishment."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken here is fantastic and the price is unbeatable for this area as is the quality. The lunch special is $6 and includes a good portion of chicken and coleslaw. The owner is a really nice guy! This has become one of my go to spots on Roncesvalles."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken is definitely the way to go. Smokey jerk chicken. awesome.
$11ish for a large takeout box portion. Enough for two meals if you're a light eater. One meal, if you're like me. 

Jerk pork and oxtail are not bad, but definitely the chicken over those."}
{"text":"You haven't had jerk until you've had it smoked on the spot. Chicken and pork. Incredibly delicious. The sides aren't as special, otherwise I'd give it a 5."}
{"text":"I had the small jerk chicken- chicken was moist and flavourful, rice was addictive and the portion was big enough for dinner and lunch the next day.  The owner(?) and cook was super friendly.  The place isn't much for d√©cor but the experience and food were really good!"}
{"text":"So far I have tried the Jerk Pork (Large - $11).

First note, it's clean and the guy behind the counter is very friendly. I normally go for the jerk chicken but today I went pork. When I ask about his favorite, the guy behind the counter starts getting excited (he's also the cook he says) it's all good but you'll like the pork. I did. It's got lots of flavour and very well spiced but mild on the spicy pepper.

The prices are in line with other Jerk spots but the big takeaway is the big flavour. The rice (with beans) is moist and above all else the food tastes really fresh. A nice little shakeup of the west side Jerk scene."}
{"text":"This place is amazing !! Delicious food for an unbeatable price. I'd have it every day if I could !!!! 

Love it !"}
{"text":"Two stars for cleanliness and friendliness. 
I almost never give negative reviews, however... 
This was definitely the least flavourful, non descript, Jamaican food I've ever had. 
Jerk chicken had not a single ounce of flavour, I've had boiled soup chicken with more flavour. The curry goat was the same, lacked any fire, depth of flavour, tasted like goat and uncooked curry powder. Rice and peas also very bland and over cooked, almost no beans to be found... 
I really wanted to like the place, again, nice guy, very clean, but the food was sooooooooooooo poor! 
From the other reviews, this seems like an off night"}
{"text":"This is a new mom-and-pop fixture on the Roncesvalle strip right next to Ice queen the previous low ratings caused me to stall on my visit. I was pleasantly surprised. The lady working at the counter is so nice. Both jerk chicken and curry chicken are good picks. The chicken is tender and you can ask for to be made spicy. Service is ultra fast too. While I've had some better Caribbean this is not bad at all. The only thing that's making it a four star is the fact that the best jerk I've had would have been cooked so much the tender chicken was falling off the bone and the flavor had completely penetrated the meat, whereas sometimes this place has very well flavored meat on the outside and the inside can be under-flavored."}
{"text":"Amazing jerk pork and chicken - the chicken is my fave in the city and I've tried them all.  $6 lunch special is a steal.  Curry goat is excellent as well.  riceis only OKAY."}
{"text":"Have ordered here and picked-up, and it has always been wonderful. Great little spot for jerk locally. Good for delivery or take-out. 

Food is delicious and freshly made. If you request spicy they do it very well. Flavourful spicy, not just blind heat. The more of their gravy, the better. Rice is fresh and full of flavour, and the meat falls off the bone as it should.

The staff and family who work there are really nice, and it has a great mom-and-pop feel. 

Love supporting a new local spot. Highly recommend. Delivery is inexpensive and the minimum order price makes it easy to order from one. Welcome to Roncesvalles guys! Very glad to have you."}
{"text":"Best Jerk Chicken I've ever had. 

Awesome value. 

Clean and friendly place. 

Lots of interesting things to try on the menu."}
{"text":"They service was excellent.  The curry chicken was pretty good but I've had better back home in Richmond Va USA. 

I saw other reviews that recommended the jerk but I had already ordered. 

Regardless the food was good and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic jerk bbq chicken, rice & peas (beans). I've had a lot of jerk around the gta and this hangs with the best. Great smoke taste, really outstanding. Thanks again! 

PS get the large. The small was enough for a normal meal but now knowing how good it was, I wish I had as much as possible."}
{"text":"I liked the owner a lot.
Great Jerk pork, I prefer a drier rice, this was more chinese style. Few parking spots in front."}
{"text":"I got the large jerk chicken. The rice was sticky and soggy? Is this sticky rice or Jamaican rice and peas ? Because they had me fooled. The coleslaw was very acidic and sour. It did not taste very good. I paid 13$ for that. Not worth the money. The chicken was Medicore nothing special. I should have gotten a refund."}
{"text":"$6 lunch specials--what's not to love?  It is a simple and clean space for those wanting a quick meal.  The special includes water or pop, jerk chicken on rice with a side slaw--the portion was great--not large but small 

The jerk chicken itself could be spicier but the tenderness was really really nice.  Rice and beans was good and the portion of meat to rice was very good!  The slaw was enough--not a slaw fan but I ate it  B wished there was hot sauce on the side though... Otherwise I appreciated the value and the cleanliness of the place!

The little shop is located in a little 'strip' city plaza with parking at the front, Ginger is a couple doors down and next it Ice Queen (a really old diner).  It is located across a medical building which was convenient for those working or waiting on an appointment.   It was definitely more of a takeout place as the two customers after me were picking up food."}
