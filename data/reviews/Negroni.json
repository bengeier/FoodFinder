{"text":"The Panini sandwiches are delicious here! - light and simple yet tasty in flavour. A great casual atmosphere with a pleasant staff and very reasonable food prices. I'm just surprised that this place is never packed. Oh well, this will be my hidden gem. Looking forward to my next munch! Om nom nom. Recommend: steak and cheese Panini."}
{"text":"Thanks to the yelpers who actually write reviews (unlike me, who has been severely remiss) -- i.e., Sarah L and Kat F -- I happened upon Negroni. I am a *huge* panini lover, so when I saw that there was a well-regarded panini restaurant in Toronto, I had to go. 

I decided on the Italian Tuna panini which was Italian tuna, lemon, capers, and hard-cooked eggs. Delish! I really wanted to try the dessert panini, but I was stuffed and couldn't even shift things around to fit it. ;-)

The Good:
- Fantastic selection of both apps and panini
- Delicious salad served with each sandwich
- Excellent staff
- Great atmosphere

The Bad:
- They have a nice wine list and serve Negronis (natch), but I wish they had a cocktail selection like Sidecar's list

I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to try out Negroni. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the food! I was having a tough time choosing a panini, so I asked the waitress to recommend a house favorite, she suggested the Sirloin and since I secreatly wanted that ones anyways, I went for it . The Panini was really good, it didn't taste like a burnt grill and it wasn't overly buttery it was served along side an arugula and fennel salad. I found the dinner menu to be very small and I have a weird thing about eating panini for dinner, so I probably wouldn't go back for dinner. But one thing I really enjoyed was the wine, 5$ amazing and it was decent! The small plates sounded delightful as well , I would go back for sure to try out some of there small plates and for more of there $5 wine!"}
{"text":"Best Panini's in the city? Most definitely! 

Negroni's has a nice atmosphere and ambiance to it, but let's not kid ourselves here, the food is the standout. 

We started with the Ricotta dip and were blown away, cheese was creamy and the flat bread was perfection. We then had a panini each and split them, I had the mortadella and my gf had the mushroom, mozza and pesto. Both were cooked to perfection and had lots of flavor. A nice thing was that they were not overly stuffed or too filling, just a nice size meal that is really fulfilling. The size salad was a nice touch as well and quite good.

Please do not forget dessert here! The nutella panini is fantastic! It may sound off putting but it is great, really creamy and quite decadent!

Add $5 wine or $4 draft (in a small pint glass) and you have a five star joint.

Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Quick/Tasty/Light/Good value.

Bunch of paninis on the menu...all came with a fennel/arugula salad. Most had a cool sounding meat + an Italian cheese + some veg. It was pretty varied so there's going to be at least 2 or 3 that sound good to you.

I had a veal meatloaf + tomato marinara + slow roasted onions (yes, they let you customize the sandwiches, as well!)


At first I was sort of ughhh about the IKEA patio tables and chairs, but they're quite comfy so maybe I should be less of a snob.


BRB @ NGRNI."}
{"text":"We both ordered a Panini, and we were both very pleased. Worth the trip. The place was not busy, just a few tables in use. We decided to sit outside (they don't have a license for drinking on outside/patio) so no wine during this stop. The bread on the panini was cooked just right, firm, crispy, but not over cooked. The best panini we ever had. We also ordered an olive appetizer, pretty good. The only downside to the visit was the waitress. Once the food arrived, she never came back to check the table. I would have liked more to drink, maybe desert,  but she didn't come back until my wife used the bathroom after we were completely done eating several minutes. I still left over 20% tip....I'm a generous tipper, up to 30%, but she didn't deserve 20% to be honest. I think I left the 20% being the food was so good. The brunette waitress is lucky to be working at a place with such good food."}
{"text":"I cannot say how amazing Negroni is. 

I arranged a birthday party (for a group of 16) and the staff were very accommodating - they held the best table in the house and were extraordinarily attentive. The service went off without a hitch - food was delivered on time, as a group and piping hot! Add the great value of the menu and it was a winning event! 

Negroni is a gem - fantastic concept and great staff make it one of those places you will frequent."}
{"text":"After an amazing intro to the world of Negroni Panini at the Yelp Elite event, I have come back a number of times. The regular panini's are so filling, I haven't had room in my belly for more nutella and strawberries.  At the elite event, I tasted the salted cod puree. I haven't been able to get this out of my head. On the menu, they serve the cod with polenta. But, the other best thing at Negroni is the bread. So, last time, I asked, politely, for the cod on crispy bread. The wonderful waitress made me a salad on the side so it was more like a meal. The lemon peel in the cod rocks my world. I hadn't noticed it the first time I tasted this spread.  
The mozzerella, pesto sandwich is decadent, as well. 
Great wine selection by the glass- forego anything special, though the House red is amazing."}
{"text":"There doesn't seem to be a new entry on the now renamed and redesigned Carpano.

The name may have changed but the food is still fantastic; however, I don't think paninis are offered for dinner anymore (I didn't ask, so can't confirm this). 

Instead of paninis, Carpano now offers a more extensive Secondi, and it looks like they've changed up their appetizers as well. I had the rigatoni with beef cheeks, and a bit of gnocchi. The gnocchi isn't listed on their website, so it may have been a daily special. 

Both dishes were very tasty. The gnocchi was freshly made, and topped with a delicious tomato sauce and olive oil. The gnocchi was light and fluffy, not starchy. The only downside was that it wasn't very filling. On the other hand, the rigatone plate was a hearty dish of tender beef cheek and al dente cooked rigatone. The pasta is topped with a bit of fontina and served with what I think is the braising liquid from the beef cheek . The beef cheek is so tender, you can easily pull it apart with your fork. 

Fortunately, Capapno still offers their wonderful homemade ice cream for dessert. We had half chocolate, half peanut butter ice cream, and it was fantastic. 

Definitely check out this place and their new menu. They still serve a ton of paninis for lunch according to the website (http://carpano.ca/dinner.html), and their new secondis look mighty fine. Also, the prices here are still very affordable."}
{"text":"Have been hearing a lot of great things about this place on yelp and decided to try it with friends last weekend. All the great ratings are true and the biggest surprise of all -  I called on friday for reservations and they had a table available at 7:30 on a saturday. I love the low key atmosphere and the great service. 
The food was top notch. I had the mushroom soup with truffle oil and then the mushroom risotto (what can i say - I heart mushrooms). Loved both the dishes although the risotto was a bit heavy and I had to get most of it to go and had it for lunch the next day - not a bad thing at all. 
We lingered over great coffee and delicious desserts - a perfect evening. Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night bite after a large pub crawl that included Mullins and Toby's. The small plates and cocktails were very good and the service was ... Very enthusiastic. 

I don't think I would have picked the place on my own but I have some friends with more opulent tastes."}
{"text":"I have to echo all of the comments already posted and say that the food here is excellent. 

I work right around the corner and had passed by Negroni on many occasions. Strangely, though, the place was entirely empty when we arrived (which was 1pm on a Monday afternoon). My parents were visiting from out of town, and decided that this would be a good opportunity to check out Negroni.

I had the chicken panini (it came with a side salad). It was filling and totally hit the spot. It was just the right size portion (I didn't feel too sleepy going back to work after lunch ;-)). For around $10, what you get is totally reasonable. For dessert my table shared the peanut butter ice cream, which just like everyone else says here, is totally to die for. 

As far as service and ambiance is concerned, there were no complaints from my table. Our waitress was very attentive and took great care of us."}
{"text":"My most recent visit to Negroni was a 3.5-star experience. The menu options for vegetarians were surprisingly limited -- ALL of the risottos and the soup of the day are made with chicken stock, the vegan panino wasn't on the menu anymore, and the kitchen was out of mozzarella di bufala that day. I felt we'd been lured in on false pretenses, expecting the many vegetarian-sounding dishes like mushroom risotto to actually be vegetarian. Ultimately the three vegetarians in my party ordered the three vegetarian entree choices on the menu: one panino (which was delicious - I'd recommend Negroni diners stick with the panini in general), and two kinds of pasta (the spaghetti pomodoro was nothing special, and the lemon pecorino fettuccine was nice but so simple you could easily make it at home). Our waiter was excellent (5-star service) and very accommodating, offering the vegetarians mix-and-match panini from the various roasted vegetables and cheeses on the menu. The desserts (a Nutella strawberry and mascarpone panino, and a peanut butter ice cream) were stellar, as usual. I'll go back, but expecting to eat whatever sole vegetarian panino is on the next menu."}
{"text":"Everyone loves this place and I'm no different.  Ever since they diversified their new menu it's cemented as one of my favourites.  As other's have stated, Neil is awesome and always super friendly.

The pastas are delicious and well made, which is impressive considering how little space they have to work with.  I always try their soup de jour as they are always extremely flavourful - the last one being an earthy cream of mushroom soup lightly drizzled with truffle oil.  Perfect for dunking my sandwich in.

If you've got a sweet tooth, try the dessert panini, it's messy as hell and lolgood.  Having chocolate all over your face is very becoming."}
{"text":"There are places that astound you with their traffic of customers despite the mediocrity in their food and service departments. Spring rolls and the Pickle Barrel come to mind. And there are the unsung heroes of the local dining scene that leave you amazed in wonderment as to why they aren't mobbed with patrons more often. Thankfully Negroni falls into the latter category. Folks, this resto is a gem and deserves to supported. Excellent, thoughtful service-check. Casual yet chic decor and low key atmosphere-check. Quality ingredients and fantastically priced menu-checkity check check. 

Seriously, this place is worth a look they do many things here with endearing charm and earnestness. I came here a couple times this week after striving to make it out here all summer. Apparently my feet think that a short walk west of college and bathurst is far even though I've wandered off further. Anyways, I was able to check out Negroni's this week with my fellow friend Christine C. and we had a grand old time. The house specialty here are the panini's, several different kinds involving meat, cheese and vegetables, alas we went another route but maybe next time! 

We sampled their cheese and meat plates as well as a caprese type salad. The cheese plate had piave, taleggio, gorgonzoloa, and the name escapes me now but rughetta? a wonderful soft goat's cheese blend that Chris knew inside and out. Our meat plate featured wild boar cacciatore, smokey chorizo, bresaola, house liver pate, porchetta and cured duck's breast. Both the meat and cheese selections were delicious, I really enjoyed the smokey chorizo and porchetta being a smoke fiend. The caprese type salad was the star of the evening for me. A simply composed dish but the fine ingredients elevated it to an extraordinary salad. To start you have a few thick rounds of rich and creamy buffalo mozzarella topped with a homemade pesto that was not excessively oily but still retained a good body. Add to that some homemade oven dried tomatoes which were savoury and bursting with sweet, acidic goodness. Yummy. 

Desserts don't take a back seat either for their homemade peanut butter ice cream is killer. Paired off with some berry coulis and fresh berries, you have a flavour profile unlike a PBJ sammy. Creamy, robust and sweet. I could come here again and again to satisfy my sweet tooth. We were also very fortunate to sample a dessert panini-a toasted concoction of nutella and get this-marscapone cheese. Woowee, very filling for a dessert but decadent nonetheless. 

In the booze department, they feature several wines by the glass all cheaply priced under $10 and several microbrews. And nothing on the menu exceeds the $15 mark, a reasonably priced menu for night out not unlike their sister restaurant-Sidecar! 

In short, this place is swoonworthy, impressive and reasonable. It deserves a look. Go. Soon."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about Negroni from fellow Yelpers, I was pleasently surprised that it was quiet during Taste of Little Italy. It was the perfect place to sit and have a meal and escape the crowds. The big windows were open and we could enjoy the live music outside, and the soccer game and air con inside. 

We both got paninis. The pancetta, with cheese, tomato and lemon caper mayo was delcious. I think it was the best panini I've ever had. My goat arugula and mushrooms were good too. The bread is toasted to a perfect 10. Crunchy but not hard. 
Served just as other reviewers describe. With the fennel and arugula salad, shaved parm, olives and coucous. I love it because it doesn't change, I get exactly what I expect.

I love this place and want to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Located at the northeast edge of Little Italy, Negroni is quite possibly the only place on the Italian strip to offer delicious, and cheap paninis. If you're lucky, you'll snag a seat on their small patio. 

Green friendly, the owners (who double as chefs & servers!) wrapped my panini to-go on one of their own plates. Try the Buffalo/Pesto/Oven-dried tomatoes or the spicy Italian sausage, and definitely finish with their homemade peanut butter or vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"Best damn Panini I've ever had in my life. Get the roasted chicken. Everyone I was with got a different and everyone was quite satisfied. Appetizers are great too though the beef carpaccio had a bit too much oil added to it. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Why is just place so often empty? It doesn't make any sense! I tried out a salad and panini here and it was AMAZING! Not only is the food here really good, the place is in a nice area and has great decor. Toronto, we have to go here more and make sure this place doesn't fail due to poor attendance when it has such good affordable food!

Support Negroni please!"}
{"text":"What a cute place! Stopped in here while running errands and had a great lunch. The herbed bufala ricotta definitely lives up to the hype, and is perfect for a steamy summer day: cool, lightly herby, much fluffier than your typical ricotta cheese, and served with an ample portion of perfectly toasted bread. Yum. I had the pork loin with their Italian barbecue sauce, which was good though the pork was slightly dry. It could have used a little cheese, but really, what couldn't use a little cheese? ;)

The biggest drawback to Negroni is the noise. It really carries in there. Even though the restaurant was barely full, there was group of 6 women with two infants, and between the babies squealing and the loud squawking of housewife chatter, it became too cacophonous in the restaurant for me. I can only imagine what the noise is like when the restaurant is full! It'd be great if they could do something with the acoustics to not make the noise bounce so much. 

Regardless, it's a damn fine sandwich. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Decent interior setting. Service was excellent. I had a roasted chicken panini, and it was good. All the panini's are served with arugula and fennel salad."}
{"text":"Almost empty on a Thursday night? How is this possible. Negroni - where are your line ups? Your regulars? Your panini lovers? 

Perhaps they had just painted, but I swear, I kept smelling a lacquer... but that didn't stop me from enjoying a table full of plates of \"plates.\" 

Full of assorted cheeses and charcuterie, ample enough for a party of two (that would be Toronto's own Vivek S and me), and served with a well appointed glass of full bodied red, this feast was festive. 

The chicken pate was a favourite on the cured side, while the Gorgonzola, ricotta spread and the brie (I do believe it was a brie) took my simple senses to a euphoria, I haven't experienced since the last time I sat down with a big plate of cheeses in my presence. The crostini was plentiful and refilled, for the perfect amount. And if you're feeling soupful, do order their soup of the day, if it's anything like the tomato soup I had last night, you won't be disappointed!

I would however, give the chicken salad a pass. The chicken, while tender, was awkwardly placed in a carpaccio style beneath a dose of greens, leaving me feeling meh about it."}
{"text":"With days and counting until my FARC buddy Deanna relocates to NYC the girls who love the meat were on the loose again this evening trying to squeeze in a few last restos until we have to say adieu. Tonight we hit up Negroni, one of the latest additions to the trough of the College street eateries. I'm writing this review in intervals because I'm busy chowing down the leftovers of what I refer to as the Holy Trinity of panini's. This was a dessert panini filled with mascarpone, Nutella and fresh sliced strawberries, grilled to piping hot crunchy perfection and finally dusted off with powered sugar. Even cold this panini still delivers an orgasm factor of flavour and lip smacking goodness. Forgive me Father for I have sinned. Pass me the panini, I'm going to hell. 

Negroni is a comfy, laid back spot which was described by a previous Yelper as doing one thing good and doing it very, very well and that is grilling up panini's. Oddly enough dessert, which was comped to us by the manager was the only panini we tried. We opted for a meat plate and a cheese plate and were very pleased with both. 

The cheese plate consisted of Tallegio, Piave, Gorgonzola and one of my most personal favorite Italian cheeses, Rochetta, which is goat's milk, sheep's milk and cow's milk combined. The meat plate was made up of smoked duck breast, a porcetta that had a maple smoked glazed on its crust, a Niagara proscuitto, some tasty smoked Chorizo sausage and little bowl of the house pate. There were side condiments such as a spicy red current jelly and a carmelized onion spread. 

To compliment this we also ordered some oven roasted tomatoes, intermixed with some Buffalo mozzarella, fresh basil and a really delicious fresh pesto that had a beautiful body and consistency to it. I often find pesto to be over processed and oil laden, this was not the case. Our server brought us an additional plate of stacked pieces of grilled toasts that had been lightly drizzled with some olive oil. He thought with all the nibbling we were doing that we'd want the extra bread. Throughout the evening the service was excellent and I really like when the staff genuinely engage you in talking about the food. 

All this delicious cheese and meat got washed down by a couple of glasses of a very light but delightful Sangiovese. I must say the pour on the wine was uber generous and our waiter poured right at our table. 

Dea dragged me in to Negroni mostly because of the peanut butter ice cream which has jelly drizzled over it. It's a PB&J in a bowl and for some odd reason it works. 

I would most definitely return to Negroni and to be candid they are breath of fresh air in the clutter of the College street restos. The place is spotlessly clean, there is not a pretentious bone in the place, the price point is so reasonable for both food and drink and the quality of the food is excellent. The chef is a young woman who is a grad of George Brown College and I like her style. The combinations of panini's that Negroni is offering is adventurous.  How about asparagus with Asiago and oven roasted tomatoes?  Sure beats the hell outta of the standard panini \"sangwiches\" we are usually subjected to.  

Got a few mouthfuls left to chow down so later peeps.  The Holy Trinity is whispering my name.....eat me....eat me.....eat me...."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand what the hype is about. Have been here a few times and have never been blown away by the food. The paninis are competent but just not great. The ingredient combinations never have any magic in them; they aren't even very complementary most of the time. Often, a single ingredient or sauce will be the overpowering flavour and the rest of the ingredients in the panini don't do anything except add texture."}
{"text":"This place is quickly becoming a favorite.    

The message here is subtle and clear.   \"We do one thing, but we do it very very very well.\"

Everything on the menu is delicious.  Wonderful grilled sandwiches.  Small, simple decor.   A pleasant degree of much-appreciated sacrilege with the way that they use old synagogue benches.

But it seems as though their peanut butter ice cream is the hidden gem in the neighborhood...   IT IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST ICE CREAM IN THE CITY.   You can taste the angels that they've clearly deep-froze and ground up and sprinkled all over the mix.   I have no idea how they do it.

I really want this place to succeed.   Check it out."}
{"text":"Finally got to check out this place this week and was quite impressed. Tiny but nice little patio overlooking College, attentive service, and a helluva panini! Minus one star because I seemed to catch them on a day that they were running out of stuff... No arugula pesto:( So I had the mushroom and goat mozarella panini ($11) with basil pesto instead, still tasty and served with a delicious salad. The mixed greens came with these tiny couscous-like pasta-ball things. What a great idea! 
My friend had already eaten dinner so just wanted dessert. She was dying to try the famous peanut butter ice cream, but our waiter told us apologetically that the ice cream that day was \"runny\" so they took it off the menu. She had the panna cotta instead and said it was very good. 
I'll definitely be back to try the dessert panini!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant. My husband and I had a full meal, appetizers, panini, pasta, dessert, coffee and drinks. Everything was delicious, you could tell the ingredients were fresh and of good quality. Very friendly service and great ambiance. The bread used for the panini is amazing! They are about to expand their patio area, so we will definitely be back when the weather is warmer."}
{"text":"I'm trying to convince my sister to move to Toronto.  Every time she comes for a visit, I take her on a whirlwind tour of my favourite places to try convince her to sublet some student's dump of a bedroom for July & August.  She loves Negroni and Neil (our favourite waiter) may have sealed the (moving) deal with her last week.

The good:
- I love panini.  I usually get the porcetta with BBQ sauce and add the slow roasted onions (note: this sandwich should just COME with onions. Any onions.)
- I sampled some of Beth's prosciutto sandwich last time and it was also delicious
- Negroni introduced me to a vegetable called fennel;  wow, do I ever love fennel
- It's very reasonable - it was $40 for 2 of us with tax and tip (only 1 alcoholic drink)
- Top notch staff
- GREAT music that the cooks get to pick

The bad:
- There could be more beers available
- The aforementioned lack of onions on the porcetta (they are happy to add some though)
- It's always less busy than I want it to be and the sound carries and echoes when it's empty

Would I ever eat here again?
Yes.  I will take my sister here once a week when she moves to town.  We will sample every panini they have to offer and she will stay in Toronto for forever because she won't be able to live without Negroni panini."}
{"text":"Named after the Negroni cocktail, I'm assuming. They don't serve it with a giant ice cube like at their sister resto Sidecar, but it's still delicious. Paninis (or panini if we want to be grammatically correct in Italian) are delicious. A nice sit-down restaurant experience that is accessible to everyone. The side salad was pretty tasty but the panini were the highlight! I got the steak one. Very delicious. Service is quick, friendly and attentive (though there were only two tables). Still though! It's close by and I can't wait to go back. I'm liking the Sidecar/Negroni people's work, and would be interested in trying fancy cocktails at the Toronto Temperance Society if I can get in without paying for a membership."}
{"text":"This is definitely a spot to go at the start of a good bar crawl or at the end of a good bar crawl. 

The food is great, served tapas style for most dishes. Everything else is priced by the piece as it's more a snack bar and drinks locale than a full restaurant. Wouldn't even call it a gastropub. Our favorite was the grilled octopus which was cooked to perfection and harmonized with the right amount of olive oil and tart. 

Of course they're known for their Negronis which are very well made. I would recommend they're one absynthe mix drink (which I forget the name) but it was out of this world!

Service was really great, and the atmosphere is trendy,casual and very chill and relaxed. Definitely start your night off here!"}
{"text":"Shared 2 desserts: flourless chocolate cake & house made peanut butter ice cream... after a few bites, I came in my pants."}
{"text":"After 2 failed attempts at eating here (they were closing both times) i found myself hungry (well my friend was really hungry) and decided to take the plunge after much fanfare. Was it good? Yes. Awesome? Kinda close. I will attest that the crowd there was not fan of my rantings on capitalism and free markets (nor was the watier) but screw them (hippies). Now. Lets deconstruct the sandwich (if you get anything other then the sandwich, i think you are stupid). 

Bread - Amazing? No, it was OK. 
Condiments - Really F*NG good, the red pepper aioli was a knock out, the goat cheese mozzarrell (say it like a bronx-living italian) was nectar.
Meat- good, but kinda chincy, they should have had the option to double the meat, (ANDREW NEED MEAT).
Side: nice little side of green and some kind of bean assortment, nice and light and complemented the sannie really well. 

All in all, I would definitely come back, its great for a quick meal on a hot summer night, or a quick fix on a cold winter day. Price was very reasonable ( $15/person tip incl.)"}
{"text":"Finally got  around to grabbing lunch at Negroni. After a brief chat with the waitress about my cardigan (a show-stopping piece of attire for sure), I jumped into a potato and leek soup and a mushroom risotto. 

I was non-plussed by the risotto. It was starchy and didn't really have a compelling flavour. Was I expecting too much? Perhaps. The soup on the other hand, was a knock out. So, so good. Service, as usual, is top drawer."}
{"text":"Good spot! Cute decor and nice open feeling. The staff is great too. Unfortunate that it is now closed."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years and it was time to write a review. This place has gone from GREAT to just alright... They used to have fantastic paninis, now they've somewhat narrowed their menu and their selection is not as special...

A bit on the pricier side - time to look for an alternative for me..."}
{"text":"You know, I never thought I'd fall in love with another man named Neil, but here we are. Negroni Neil (server) is terrific and when I visit and see that he's working, I'm downright thrilled. He's attentive, courteous and instantly likable, and the kind of server that others would do well to emulate. 

The food here is outstanding. This is not cafeteria counter panini - these are gourmet delights created and assembled with care. I find it impossible to tear myself away from the Italian tuna, hard-boiled egg and caper panini because it's such a perfect, carefully thought out combination of flavours. It was at Negroni that I first discovered my love for fennel - each panini comes with a side salad of arugula, shaved fennel and fresh sheets of parmagiano reggiano, with a dollop of Israeli couscous, cannellini beans and olives. Really inventive pairing here. I've also sampled the dessert panini, which is less overwhelming than you think, so don't hesitate to cap off your meal with it. Fresh strawberries, nutella, mascarpone cheese and confectioner's sugar...how, pray tell, can you go wrong?? Lest you think I was satisfied with sampling only one dessert, I can promise you that the rotation of homemade ice creams is also rock solid - I've tried peanut butter as well as chocolate and they're heavenly.

Music is a delight - hand selected by the chefs themselves and including selections from Radiohead, Junior Boys, Yeasayer and the like. Everyone that works here seems to be truly happy. Down to earth owner Bill Sweete can often be found making the rounds, interacting with diners and topping up wine glasses. 

Bonus points for using OpenTable for reservations, making it a cinch to secure a table even on busy nights. Bring a date, sibling or group of friends here to impress!"}
