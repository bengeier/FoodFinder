{"text":"We just went to this place tonight, got there and it was closed. An interesting gentleman was outside and asked us where we were headed and we answer \"here! We'd like to have dinner...\" He said it's been closed for almost 2 years now!  We ended up just down the block and had an amazing dinner! Not sure how Yelp is still listing this..."}
{"text":"If you're in the Pointe and you feel the need for chicken O Bico is an a-ok spot to stop for a bite. You will be disappointed if you set your expectations based on the type of Portuguese chicken that you'd find on the Plateau, this is not Romados.  O Bico has some good diversity on the menu which includes Calamari, Chorizo Poutine (what gluttony) and even a Vegetarian Sandwich. I had the vege sandwich and fries which I enjoyed and my friends both had a quarter chicken. We all missed out on the spicy sauce which we didn't see sitting on the counter until it was too late, but I'm sure that this would have improved the chicken a notch. Overall there was nothing to rave about, but certainly nothing to complain about either.  I wouldn't make a special out of your way trip to eat here. But, if you're in the hood it is certainly a good spot to stop in to grab an affordable bite to eat. Oh and they have Sumol, a fruit flavoured Portuguese soft drink. be sure to order one with your meal."}

{"text":"We live in Pointe St-Charles and each time there is an interesting restaurant opening here it quite a welcome event!  O Bico is the first \"Portuguese Chicken\" in the area and in such a most welcome addition! We watched the place being built during the summer and we wanted to try it since then... well tonight was the night and we decide to opt for the take out, not that the place doesn't look nice, it does, but we felt more like having a meal in the warmth of our home.  The staff is very nice and professional. We ordered the whole chicken (available only for take out) that comes with two coleslaw and a choice of two sides (we went with the fries). We were a bit surprised by how generous the portions were (including the chicken which was bigger than usually in portuguese chicken places)! A very good value for the $23 that we paid (including taxes).  The chicken itself was very good, maybe not spicy enough for my taste but I should have specified it.  All in all, maybe not the best portuguese chicken that I have ever tasted but quite good and certainly the best in the area!"}
{"text":"O bico est un petit restaurant portugais sympa dans Pointe Saint-Charles. Une autre belle addition dans ce quartier en plein changement.  C'était ma fête et j'ai commandé sur place un poulet entier pour emporter. Le poulet vient avec deux salades de chou et le choix de deux accompagnements: frites juliennes, pommes de terre rôties ou salade du chef. Le poulet était vraiment bon, tendre et bien cuit. La salade de chou était crémeuse et bien croquante et les frites étaient bonnes également. J'ai aussi pris deux Sumol, une boisson gazeuse fruitée typiquement portugaise, car mon fils en raffole!  Le service est hyper rapide; je me suis à peine assise que la commande était déjà prête! Le propriétaire est vraiment très gentil et les portions sont énormes!  Que demander de plus? Moi, qui raffole de poulet à la portugaise, j'y retourne, c'est certain!  Ah oui! Il y a aussi des 4 à 7 avec spécial 5 dollars sur les entrées avec achat d'une consommation (bière ou vin). On peut aussi réserver le restaurant pour les partys de Noël."}
