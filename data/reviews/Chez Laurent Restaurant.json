{"text":"Sh*t i just was going to order and now its permanently closed there was so much love made with there food i will miss them i always ordered when i wanted home cooked excellent food now yonge and sheppard is screwed cause there was nothing comparable now"}
{"text":"I went to this place for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend. We had never been before but based on general reviews online, it seemed decent. How cute was this place?! It's right at Yonge & Sheppard but is in an old house seemingly surrounded by new condos. It had a very home-y feel to it and the owner clearly puts a lot of love into her restaurant. We started out with beers and mussels in garlic and tomato sauce to start. I may just be biased to seafood but we devoured the mussels and dipped all our bread in the tomato garlic sauce. I got the house lasanga as my main and it was pure cheesy and creamy goodness. It was also moderately priced under $15. My boyfriend got the steak dinner which was good although the sides were sub-par.   Cute spot for dinner with lots of soul going into the food!"}
{"text":"Chez Laurent is a nice little Italian restaurant in an old house on Yonge Street. There is street parking on many of the side roads nearby and Green P parking lots as well.  The hostess and waitress were very welcoming and we did not need our reservation (weekday around 8pm), though with fairly limited seating you would want to play it safe and call ahead.   We were given ample time to order, talk, and eat, without being left unattended or pestered - a talent not had by many in the restaurant industry.   I had the escargot and the fettuccine carbonera, both of which were average or better. The ambiance and hospitality made the visit well worthwhile."}
{"text":"The place was dirty and run down. The waitress was like Casper the Ghost, can't even remember her.   As we walked in Louise screamed \"You need a reservation,\" which we had but I think she was intimidated because we looked too upscale for the place.   The food was awful. A menu item called \"the best Lasagna\" was horrible. Our dishes  arrived separately and they threw our salad forks back to be used for our main meal.   Water was scarce as we had to beg for a refill and Louise seemed irritated the whole time. Worst dinning experience in my whole life."}
{"text":"We are new to the neighbourhood and tried Chez Laurent on a recommendation. A cozy little war home on Yonge Street (we are told, the only house on this section of Yonge), it really feels like walking into somebody's house. Not a great place for big gatherings, but perfect to share an intimate meal.  The service was reasonably good, and the owner was present and attended the table often. We ordered wine at the beginning of the meal, but it never came and we felt bad about demanding it and were largely indifferent to having it. I brought it to the owner's attention at the end of the meal and she was extremely apologetic and accommodating.  As for the food, it was spectacular. I had the french onion soup, which was unusually sweet, easily had a whole spanish onion sliced into it, and lots of melted cheese. It was delicious, but was nearly a meal in and of itself. I had the veal cannelloni, which was the pasta dish of the day. It was very good, but a bit dry inside. The pasta was homemade and fantastic though, and the sauce complemented the dish very well, but I had just enough for one of the two pieces.  For dessert, we shared the lemon ice cream, which was light, but substantial, and entirely refreshing, with a crispy, crumbly crust. I would highly recommend closing the meal with this refreshing treat!  I will definitely return, but would try a different dish, and likely pass on the overly filling appetizer."}
{"text":"Since this is so close to home and was highly rated, I was ecstatic to try this little French-Italian eatery on my Dad's birthday dinner...and guess I should have tuned down my excitement. We went on a week-night, and contrary to the massive warnings about \"having to reserve a table\", we had no problem getting a table on the day of, and there were an ample amount of seatings.   ----- Food: Moderate ----- Bread   --  Gotta give credit for the bread, it was nicely done; crusty, thick and warm.   Mussels   --  Had to double check if we ordered the right thing, this being tasteless and lean. Surprisingly, the sauce was good though.   Onion Soup  --   Was sweet? Is that how the French do it? Whatever happened to the ionic bowl?  Carbonara  --  Butter overload. Period.  Lasagna  --  They lied. It definitely wasn't \"North American\" best.  Veal  --   Can be compared to a morning minute steak or the steak on a HK sizzling plate.  Creme Brulee  --  Now this is FINALLY something to brag about! This is seriously recommended.   Creme Caramel  --   Meh. No surprises here.   ----- Service: Mediocre ----- -   Louise wasn't as helpful as expected -   food came out real slow for a casual-family restaurant -   limited water refills (Almost felt like we were experiencing a water famine) -   male waiter tossed a fork at us (Sorry, didn't know we were disturbing your blooming juggling career.)   ----- Atmosphere : Mediocre----- -   very warm (Don't get me wrong, there were indivudal AC units in every room, but they didn't bother turning it on, probably because they were huge eco supporters. But I gotta give them credit for opening the main doors wide open to let a little of the city breeze in...) -   plates (shaky, granny floral plates) -   dim -   cracked vinyl chairs   Food: 3/5 Service: 2/5 Atmosphere: 2/5"}
{"text":"So sad that this place has now closed.  The food was always excellent.  It also had a feel of eating with a big family.  There were so many regulars who came in to eat, you just felt like you knew most people.    We will miss Louise and Leanne very much.  We may have to take their cooking classes to make their amazing lasagna."}
{"text":"It feels like walking into a good friend's house for dinner.    Atmosphere is warm and inviting, with old hardwood floors and wood trim around the windows.    Service is gracious, kind, friendly and helpful.  It's a family-run operation, and they are all nice and inviting.  We lingered after paying our bill, and they still checked on us to ask if we wanted water or anything.  Food tastes like mom's home cooking.  Even the flatware and china are what you would find in a family kitchen.  The staff seem to enjoy chatting about the items on the menu.  I had veal milanese with veg, and shared escargot for an appetizer.   Both were delicious.    An absolutely wonderful dining experience.  I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"The recommendation from other post on Lasagna is not what I expected, the lasagna turned out is only mediocre. Mussel has nothing special, the special recommendation of carppacio and lamb shank from the owner are not up to my expectation for a normal dinner place. It was a disappointment for the night."}
{"text":"This was one of my favourite places to go to in the past and found out theis place has been closed for a while now. Louise and Leanne were great and they do offer cooking classes where you can learn how to make some of their amazing dishes. Her lamb shank was one of my favourite dishes here."}
{"text":"hot bread was served before real food, very soft inside and crusty outside. We loved it. We ordered mussels as appetizers, which were in tomato sauce and were good.Then we had a fettuccine in cream sauce and with peas, also a chicken with tomato pasta. Both pastas were fantastic, we especially loved the fettuccine, couldn't help clearing out all food at once!! Very good food, you cannot miss this if you simply want good food in nice environment.  cozy little family house style, very friendly owner and server. We felt so welcome for every single request that we made, even it was just asking for water! Perfect for families and also couples for dinner :)"}
{"text":"Thats the best family restaurant I have ever been in Toronto! + Great service + Louise provides a personalized service, even remembering names, etc + Authentic food + Everything is organic and home made"}
{"text":"Although welcoming, there's a certain oddness to Chez Laurent. Still, it is a place you can take both a 4-year-old and a 90-year-old at the same time (which we did).   3 adults ordered French Onion Soup. I like it salty, which meant my wife loved this seemingly low-sodium soup. It was served in a regular soup bowl with grated mozzarella and some chunks of bread. It was alright. I then had the Carbonara ($12.99), which was delicious. Wife had Canelloni ($13.99) and daughter had Lasagna ($13.99). Also really good. Grandma had Salmon ($17.99) and was in love with it. Boy, did she clean her plate! The servers were nice. For dessert, Creme Brûlée, Raspberry Tartuffo and Raspberry Pie (or something like that) were also very good. Not great, but good.   I think the price/value give this a solid 3.5 but it isn't sure whether to be French or Italian so marks are deducted for style. But I'd still return."}
{"text":"As buildings get bulldozed for condo towers around it, one wonders how long Chez Laurent will keep it's precious corner of coziness in North York.    The food is simple and lovely.  I love the understated vibe of both the food and the decor.    The crusty bread they service was fresh and warm.  We ordered the mussels as an appetizer upon the suggestion of the spunky brit gal who hosts and serves.  The sauce was a perfect complement to the bread, and the mussels were very fresh as promised by our server.  The pasta was al-dente and not overly sauced (something I hate about most North American Italian restaurants).  Those who ordered veal at the table were also very pleased with their selection.  Of course, I couldn't leave without getting dessert, in this case Tartufo, which was a nice end to the meal.  Make sure you call ahead to make reservations - it can be difficult to get a seat sometimes."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very close to my house and I've been wanting to try it out forever. Stopped by on a rainy day with my bf and try it out. The restaurant doesn't look like your typical restaurant, it looks like a little house from the outside and when you walk in, it's cozy, perfect for families or a night out with a close friend. When we got there, there was an elderly women, we guessed it was the owner, greeted us and took us to our table. She was very friendly and made us feel welcomed. We order an entree each, I got the lasagna. The lasagna was homemade, the sauce spiced not too sour or too sweet but it had a slight creamy taste and it was delicious. When you sliced it, there was a good amount of meat with a tasty white filling, the pasta was not soggy but a nice firmness, overall it was amazing, best lasagna I've ever had.   My bf got the lorenzo tortellini, I took a bite out of it. It was tortellini in a cream sauce with porcini mushrooms. The cream sauce was fantastic, I highly recommend to people who like cream sauces. My bf doesn't really like creams or cheeses due to the smell but he absolutely loved the dish. The total came out to ~$33 before tip which we thought was fair for the quality and taste of the food. The only reason this is 4 stars and not 5 stars is because the portion are slightly small, however I would highly recommend this restaurant for pasta lovers and I am looking forward to go back and trying the carbonara :)"}
{"text":"Chez Laurent is quickly becoming me and Mike's favorite restaurant.  It is in a little house, and 4 out of 5 times we have been there we got a little seat right next to a window with a lace curtain, in our own little room with very little people eating around us, which is nice.  The waiter-- we always get the same guy-- didn't come off as overly friendly when we first started going here, but he did everything right and we never had to beg too hard to get his attention.  He was a very good waiter, just not very fuzzy.  But as we kept coming back, eventually he warmed up a lot, as did this other lady (the owner maybe?) who is cooking in the kitchen and also helping to bring out plates and such.  My man and I don't eat meat except for fish-- which we like to do once a week as a somewhat special occaions-- so we always get the \"catch of the day\", and it is always amazing.  It comes with some past on the side which is also amazing, and then I order a simple salad and share some of the fish and a few bites of pasta with my man.  We have also had the muscles-- also amazing-- and this one time we had a fennel cauliflower soup that the lady made us try---really, MADE US EAT It, which was a bit awkward at first but turn out to be totally worth the experience.  So being on a (somewhat) strict diet I can't really vouge for anything else on the menu; all I can say is everything I have eaten there has been honestly, amazing.    The place is comfy and homey-- you can show up fancy or go in jeans (I always do-- jeans and a nice shirt and bracely to class it up a little)-- it's really your choice.  It is a no attitude kind of place-- feels natural to us so we keep going back.    So definitely give Chez Laurent a try-- it might not seem that special at first, but just hang in there and you'll find out for yourself how this could easily be your new favorite restaurant!  Actually I shouldn't be telling you this because it's going to get too busy and I'm going to need to find a new place soon.  Shoot!"}
{"text":"A cute little family-run restaurant (a renovated house) with a super friendly owner and delicious food.   I went here with my brother on a weeknight, and had no problem getting a table without reservations. But the place was pretty full, so if you have a larger group, then it may be difficult to just walk-in.  We ordered the mussels as appetizers, and they were really good. The tomato-based sauce was perfect. I wish I had saved some of the fresh bread to soak up some of that sauce, but, alas, I had already inhaled it. And then we ended up ordering a couple of the daily specials - braised veal with fettuccine and giant pasta shells baked with ricotta cheese and asparagus. Both were excellent. My brother especially enjoyed the bone marrow from the veal.  The only downside to this place is the service was a little slow (At one point, I think the owner forgot about us - she said she would be right with us and then just never returned), but I wasn't in any hurry, so it didn't really bother me.  Overall, I really enjoyed the meal and the prices were reasonable. I'll definitely be coming back to try out some more daily specials and dishes from the menu!"}
{"text":"What a mishmash of different influences.  Staff seemed confused. Took forever for them to figure out how to make a martini. If you go stick to something simple to drink. Like wine. Food was alright. No attempt was made on decoration. Kind of looks trashy. Staff was nice. It was very warm in the dinning room."}
{"text":"This is an odd little house with some great food. Kind of a hodge podge of different rooms- everything will taste and look home cooked but with some expertise and extra deliciousness. This is a great alternative to the restos on the strip with no character.  If you come here you are GUARANTEED a ton of character.  This is a nice place to come with friends pre-theatre or just if you have friends that live (lord forbid...) uptown... (I realize this is midtown but when you're a s.o.b. (south of bloor) creature it REALLY is quite the trek : )  I almost want to give you NO description of the food and the rest of the experience because it's such a nice quaint discovery... it would ruin the experience."}
{"text":"Love this place!! This is our go to spot at yonge & sheppard. Everything is homemade and absolutely delicious! It's closed for renovations until April 21 - can't wait to see what they have in store with the new look!"}
{"text":"This is a quirky restaurant unlike any other. I think the food is delightful but the decor is ... well ... yard-sale. The owner-manager, whom I believe to be a South African expat from the sound of her accent, takes care of customers in a kind of funny, clucking-hen, maternal way. It all feels very familiar, like a long lost relative decided to go ahead and open a restaurant in their own living room. And the cast of characters working and dining there make it seem like you've stepped into a scene from Coronation Street.  I suspect all the food on the menu is good from the moans of pleasure from tables around us, along with the lineup of customers arriving without reservations, but there are gems throughout the menu that will become your favorites. My guy loves the dressing on the oh-so-deceivingly simple bean salad. It is so unremarkable looking, it's like your aunt Millie poured the can of unico beans onto your plate. Yet the tangy flavour is absolutely, simply, DIVINE. How is that possible? And the mussels are scrumptious. We make mussels at home all the time but will still order them at Chez Laurent because the broth is 10X better. As a non-Italian lasagna aficionado, I can assure you the lasagna at CL is up there among the best Canadian-style lasagnas around. Oh, and the freshly-baked bread is downright dangerous to the appetite you'll need ... so be careful ... but if you ask for a doggie-bag (not for your Pug or Rottweiler but for yourself) they make a little basket out of tin foil so you can take your leftover meal home."}
{"text":"I love the pasta here. Fettuccine Alfredo is wonderful.The owner and her family are lovely. Sometimes they screw up the pacing and will serve you something ridiculously late (like forgetting your drink, and bringing it after you've finished your meal). But the food is wonderful."}
{"text":"Nice place with great food  The food here is great everything freshly made with love and tender care. I started off with the Tomato e Bocceoncini and a nice Italian salad. The tomatoes were nice and juicy and the cheese was very tasty, the salad was perfect with just the right amount of sauce to salad ratio. For my main I ordered the Zurichioise Fettucine. The dinner was wonderful, nice creamy sauce with delicious chicken. The people here really know how to cook and I can't wait to try the rest of the menu.  The place is a really small area but the food makes up for it. It has a very homey feel to it, mostly because it looks like the place was just a regular house before, but it adds character to the place. The seating seems very cramped and you can hear other peoples conversations across the room but it didn't really bother me. Other then that the place had an ok atmosphere to it.   The service was really good always checking in on you and always showing a nice smile on their faces. The environment doesn't really stand out too much the food definitely makes up for it."}
{"text":"If you want to talk about a family-run business that has stood the test of time, Chez Laurent is one of the first places that come to mind. In fact, the quaint little house that it occupies must be some kind of historical landmark because all of the buildings around it are being demolished for brand new condo developments.  The head chef opens her house on some Saturday mornings for a cooking school of which I have attended a few classes. I think their familiarity with me lends to a welcome feeling everything I go their restaurant. I can say that when I am seated, I can see that they share the same level of warmth with the other restaurant patrons.  They have quite an extensive menu but what impresses me most is that most of their pasta dishes are around $11-13. The portions are not huge but they measure up to other Italian eateries that would charge up to $20 for a similar plate.  And of course, the taste and authenticity is there to match.  I highly recommend this place and it is worth checking out.  Just make sure that if you plan to go at a peak time, make a reservation."}
{"text":"Amazing food, extremely quaint and cozy. Only complaint is the presentation of the food, but the flavors and and freshness of the food more than outweigh that negative!"}
{"text":"Best Veal Milanese in the city. Period. End of story. It's my \"go to\" place for comfort food, yet I can't get myself to try anything else on the menu as a main (except for the appetizers, of course).  Based on what my wife and kids (21 & 16) order, it's obvious that their dishes are prepared with the same love and attention as my VM.  The whole experience is like eating at your favourite aunt's home. The aunt who knew how to cook better than your mom, but you would never tell your mom that.  Oh! The price is very fair for the quality and service you receive.   Chez Laurent is a definite keeper!!!"}
{"text":"We've always wanted to try this place since we live in the neighbourhood. Almonst all the high rises, this restaurant is in a little house along Yonge St. It's a very cozy restaurant with one wait staff and the owner who takes your order. Apparently they've been in business for 27 years. We ordered some apps (mussels, escargot, onion soup and soup of the day), pasta for our mains and skipped dessert. The thought the food was average but my husband enjoyed all his dishes. Would I go again? Maybe."}
{"text":"When friends mentioned that they wanted to meet us for dinner in North York, we struggled to find an excuse not to go.     With so few Saturday nights in our lives, we dreaded spending one of them splurging on chain-resto vomit amongst the suburban condo-dweller set.  But they were good friends... and we hadn't seen them in almost a year... so we trekked up to North York and prepared for the worst.  It never came.  What a wonderful surprise they'd found.    As we were waiting to get in, we were alongside someone who left North York for the west coast 15 years ago... it's still his favorite restaurant and he comes every single time he's in town.  A beautifully small and intimate space.   Outstandingly prepared food and warm personalized service.  I had something involving veal.  It was extraordinary.  We're already planning on coming back."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  Very home-like feel including the decor, cutlery, etc.  Food is unbelievably good and they run a cooking school as well, so you know that they know their stuff.  Been many times and will go many more!"}
{"text":"Love this place...always get the caesar salad, escargots and a veal dish..I just read that it is now closed. I am very P.O'd."}
{"text":"Quite an intriguing find - a French-Italian restaurant that's nestled in a very old house reflective of how this bustling area used to be a sleepy suburban ages ago.  Its really charming like in the animated movie \"Up\" and one could only imagine how an old man would have pulled out his shotgun to the black suit developers.  But this venue will never be torn down, to my opinion, and is a landmark amidst the metropolitan & business sophistication of the area not because of its probable Heritage status but because of the love of the people who keep coming back.  My first visit to this place brought forth a river of prose & poetry with the unexpected yet soothing simplicity of the place.  The feel, the aroma, the quaint architecture - filled with cottage coziness.  With a log burning with real fire in the fireplace (these things still exist? cool!!!) the laced window table overlooking the street where we were escorted to became a bit more romantic.  This is not a fancy, sophisticated, nor contemporary place, shabby for some, but Chez Laurent is a quiet authority on experience.    Great for family dining, social or group get-together, and romantic dates.  I was surprised and amused that one of their patrons held a Labrador Retriever as guide dog and was welcomed by the staff who apparently knows him (or them) too well.  My husband has been here on several occasions with his co-workers and they would usually reserve one of the inner rooms of the house. Tells me this place really gets PACKED so calling ahead for RESERVATIONS is a must.  And you cannot stay too long because they're fully booked by the hour.  It's a wonderful place for a quiet dinner before a show at the nearby Toronto Center for the Arts or to see an event at the Mel Lastman Square.  Mature crowd, probably in their thirties until retirement years  The service is one of the best.  Greeted warmly at the door with old school warmth and hospitality, led to our seat with sweet politeness, thorough, unimposing, no-rush accommodation on the menu and service, and we didn't have to call them for anything during the meal.  Always good timing and its lovely.  They have Specials for the day which were articulated to us in luscious detail.  Enough to whet our appetite, listening and making the choice were pretty tough.  The food is great, not spectacular but utterly satisfying.  If I had a third thumb I would raise it.  No ego, no sophistication but real home style cooking filled with luscious and wholesome goodness served on traditional gold lined flower painted and scalloped rim plates and bowls.  Main dishes range from $9.95-$21.95.   We had Escargots for starters.  Sweet balls of snail meat served hot, delicately buttered and generously garnished with herbs.  It was like the seafood French truffles.  Then the first sip of the \"soup of the day\" I had, that's carrot based sans meat, I was swirled into my childhood in my old gramma's kitchen - the all too familiar sweet aroma and rich flavor, oh-my-gawwwd! - too nostalgic.  Kinda freaky but... \"amazing\" is an understatement. My husband had the freshest French onion soup he ever had with croutons and cheese and he was filled almost instantly.  No, he didn't have that back to the future episode.  That's just me.  We shared it and it was so delish.  For the main course, I had Villetto alla Marsala (veal scaloppine in a sweet marsala wine sauce) and this dish pushed a mute button on my chatty mouth for a full minute (kinda made me nervous) as I chewed on the delectable juicy meat with this really mouthwatering sauce. I chose the vegetables for the siding instead of the pasta and those were nicely buttered & herbed.  And this other sweet mashed siding - I can't remember exactly what it was called but it was rich with flavor and meltingly enjoyable (mute button again).  My husband had this chicken dish with rose sauce and black olives, bathing in mushrooms too.  I had a couple of slice from his plate and it was good.  But my veal was better to my bias.  The meal for the two of us came to about $58 plus tax.  Serving portions are just right for a very satisfying dinner giving us a bit more room for coffee and desserts.  But we preferred to go somewhere else that night to explore the area a bit more.  Its seldom that we come to this part of town.  But in our next visit, we would definitely have some of their crème brule and cakes. Their wine menu was really tempting but we were too fickle so, yeah, next time.  They open from 5pm from Monday to Saturday only."}
