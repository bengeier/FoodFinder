{"text":"Great price great burgers. Had the gold and green burger and some wings and it was great."}
{"text":"Dotty's has a reputation for good burgers. They have some pretty good burgers, but it never really blew my mind. Dotty's was just a little too packed when I went and it was hard to get a conversation going or even hear myself think. I would recommend trying to get to Dotty's at an odd dinner hour or earlier in the evening."}
{"text":"As noted by many other reviewers, the wait staff at DDD is nothing to write home about.  I would go one step further and say that the bartender was the most unfriendly, rude person I've ever encountered with that particular job description.  Friendly bartenders get good tips--just a thought.  I will say, though, that my burger (Melting Pot--a complete heart attack on a plate) was delectable and perfectly cooked.  The cheese curds were also fantastic.  So I will be back, fully expecting not to recieve stellar service.

UPDATE, July 2013:  I haven't been back!  There are so many other great places in Madison that offer fantastic food and friendly service!  I've also become attached to my thinner waistline.  Why would I go back to Triple-D?"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers. Plenty of cold drinks. Little place that really can move people through. Great spot if you're looking for more than just a plain burger but still nothing to fancy or weird."}
{"text":"I love Dottys.  I had the chance to eat at the original once before it was torn down, and I know many are faithful to it, but I really think the new one hits the spot just as well.  First off, don't leave without some cheese curds.  It's worth the calories...to...die...for.  Then, order up a burger (or other sandwich)...with so many options to choose from, it's almost impossible, but no matter which you decide on, it's good.  I stick with the basic cheese burger, lil lettuce/tomato/fried onions, and it hits the spot.  My boyfriend claims the ostrich burger is out of this world, but I'm not brave enough for that.  Top it off with a cold one (I prefer spotted cow), and I consider it a great meal if you're in the mood for casual night out.  Little bit pricey for a burger, but definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"We ordered  burgers , onion rings , cheese curds and chili fries.
Most the burgers were good (the burger ordered well done was medium ).

Waitress was inattentive until she delivered the bill then offered to refill our drinks."}
{"text":"Dotty's is known around town as the place to go for burgers. And rightfully so, I would say: they've got a great selection and they do them well. But the thing I really love about this place is the atmosphere. It's completely old-school Wisconsin - dim but comfortable lighting, lots of polished wood, years and years of local memorabilia decorating the walls. I would almost give it 5 stars for the interior alone. But the thing that sealed it for me is not their burgers, but the Friday fish fry, which was probably the best I've had in a town that worships the FFF. Dotty's gives you 2 huge, delicious pieces of walleye, along with fries, slaw, etc. I never knew fish could taste so good."}
{"text":"Dotty's is famous for their burgers in Madison, Wisconsin. A simple recipe burger consisting of a beef patty, crispy bacon, cheddar, and a sesame bun focuses on the trifecta of meat, carbs, and cheese. The burger will definitely satisfy a burger craving (or the college appetite), however it lacks the polish to make it famous too much further than Madison. A softer bun, juicier beef, and a more mouthwatering combination of flavors with some punch from sauce/salt/vinegar could put this simple burger on the national map."}
{"text":"Dotty's is a college-y burger place that's right off of state street. This would be a good place to take your parents if they're visiting from out of town.  It's an actual restaurant where you sit down, are waited on, get cutlery and dishes (although it might be just baskets).  Dress is very causal, but you won't stick out if you're not wearing college kid clothes too bad.  

As far the menu, it's like slightly fancy burgers and fries.  

Fancy = more than just ketchup for sauces.  

Burger and fries = lots of burger variations and stuff from the deep fryer."}
{"text":"When I order a burger, I want a burger.  If I wanted tasty bacon, lovely cheese, and other fixins... well, I would probably go to a store, buy them, and eat at home.  DDD does great fixins, but I've never enjoyed their burgers.

To elaborate, I like my burgers to be burger-y.  I want the bun to be fresh, and a good balance to the patty, I want the patty to be cooked as I ask for it (medium-rare) and nice and juicy.  I want the patty to be the *star* of the burger.  

In 3 visits to DDD, the burger patty has ranged from cardboard-y to slightly less cardboard-y.  The only reason I finished each burger was because of the dump-truck sized amounts of bacon, cheese, jalapenos, and delicious tasting sauce.  Baconcheesejalapeno makes everything taste OK - even shite meat.

So, if you want a burger loaded with fixins (the combinations, admittedly, are quite creative and well made) then this is your place.  If you want a BURGER, then keep on walking.

Also, the cheese curds are good, the beer is refreshingly intoxicating, and the location and general \"vibe\" of the place are nice.  One caveat, when sporting events are occurring, good luck getting a table and when you get one, be prepared for plenty of sozzled undergrads and bros."}
{"text":"One of the best burger places in Madison, WI. THere are so many combinations that you could make and each burger is cooked to perfection. The side items are also well made and filling in themselves. Great beer selection as well and great place with booths to hang out in."}
{"text":"Service was very prompt. I got the Lamb Burger (outstanding) wife got the Runnelstone burger. We ordered the Appetizer sampler (the cheese curds and mac and cheese wedges are incredible) they have a great selection of micro brews. And fairly priced as well"}
{"text":"Dotty's has the best burger I've had in Madison. Like bacon? Like cheese? Like good beef? Look no further.

Make sure to check if there is a sporting event in the Kohl Center (time will be limited to 1 hour at a table if so) before you come. They are pretty strict about it and will remind you about your time limit. I don't like that kind of stress when eating, and I know others feel the same, so be warned.

I ordered the Melting Pot (their most popular burger), and I was not disappointed. There was a plethora of cheese, a substantial amount of beef (cooked medium), and delicious sauce (English Garlic). The size of the burger was actually quite perfect. I ordered an appetizer of fried cheese curds with my buddies, and a side order of fries, and I couldn't finish my fries. The price of fries is also not unreasonable (1.99). 

Most of the specialty burgers have bacon, so if you're not feeling it, I would recommend building your own burger. There's a starting price of 5.99, and there are many options to customize it to your own liking. You honestly don't need much if you are a beef patty purist. Their beef is great and cooked to perfection.

Get the burger cooked medium (or it becomes pretty runny, as my friends found out). I would also recommend asking for a special sauce if you order the cheese curds instead of the typical ranch. Their curds are on par with The Old Fashioned's, and the sauce definitely gives them a leg up.

Though the Dowry gets a little crowded, and parking is difficult to find if there is an event at the Kohl Center, I would recommend making your way out; writing about the burgers here is making me crave them again."}
{"text":"Went to Dotty's before the UW hockey game on Saturday night because the line at the Gritty was out the door. At least we were able to get into Dotty's, and while our quoted 45-minute was turned into over an hour, we were able to drink some beers and peruse a menu while we waited. When Karl-with-a-K, our waiter, came to the table, we told him that we were going to the game, were in a hurry, and placed our order, and he made sure that we got served fast and only missed 5 minutes of the game. The burgers were good, particularly the buns, but I wish they came with fries - I mean, seriously, who serves burgers WITHOUT fries (or any side, for that matter) these days? The cheese curds were tasty, although not as good as State Street Brats, and the fries that we ordered separately were excellent, especially because they had malt vinegar on the table, which I happily doused mine with. I'd go back to Dotty's the next time we're in Madison, but only AFTER I get my Ian's Pizza!"}
{"text":"The prices are awesome for a college town. The jumbo fries are good to share and are just 2.99 .
My friend got the the gladiator burger and really liked it and I did the build your own burger and also enjoyed it.
The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because we both had really cold buns which was irritating.
Also great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice assortment of appetizers and burgers. The best thing was the service. Super nice waitress and manager. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"5 star Burgers, Fries don't get any better, soups, all that, except I never had a salad there. A boatload of beers on tap, tap root beer, walls of TVs, close to campus, Kohl center and Camp Randall or if you prefer, \"The House Barry Built\""}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience at Dotty's - the burgers are consistently fantastic. It's really easy to build your own burger if you're not feeling any of the house menu options.
I also have to say that this is my favorite interior space in any Madison bar/restaurant - very old school. Dark wood, interesting bar, vintage collegiate/UW decor. There's usually an interesting film playing on a number of the TV's, too. Makes for an interesting yet inviting vibe.

Important to note if you're thinking about going - this place gets BUSY before any Kohl Center event. It's not enormous inside and can get pretty packed... not the best choice if you're in search of a leisurely meal before an event/game."}
{"text":"Food was ok to decent, non-beer drinks choices are a little limited. Burgers are gluten free but no gluten free buns (not a big deal though - presentation was nice on a plate instead). We might be back although we have gotten better burgers and service elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went to Dotty Dumpling's Dowry as part of my research into burgers in Madison on a recent trip. I'd have to say that the burger here was perfectly cooked, well-seasoned and constructed of high quality meat.

I got the Rolls Royce burger which is basically a fancy bacon cheeseburger. I thought the Belgian ale cream sauce might have been a kind of gimmick, but it really assisted the burger in a good way. Also, as previously mentioned, the burger was cooked to a perfect medium.

The atmosphere of Dotty Dumpling's is also really quite pleasant and good for groups of four or five to sit at a booth."}
{"text":"Great food, even greater staff. I ordered a veggie burger, and it began to fall apart. Immediately the kitchen made me a completely new one. I cannot empathize how kind and understanding the staff was. The manager even came out and offered me a free slice of pie. This staff is truly the kindest and the food was amazing. Definitely did not leave hungry or unsatisfied. To the Dotty's Dumplings Dowry staff- thank you."}
{"text":"Best burger in Madison, excellent service. Great fresh ingredients. The patty is perfectly prepared and the toppings don't overwhelm the flavor of the beef. I don't hear this place mentioned in discussions of great burgers but it should be. The hot fries with blue cheese are also a staple."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had and amazing fried cheese curds! A little dark when you walk in, but it's fine when your eyes adjust to the low light!"}
{"text":"The food was good. There was plenty of burger choices, but not much else in the way of variety. That earns four stars. 

Subtract one star because they do not split checks, although we were advised if we had sat at the bar, the checks could be individualized.

The server was certainly not on top of her game. Subtract another star. Getting things was like pulling teeth. When ice tea was delivered, one guest asked for a straw. Instead of bringing back additional straws for the table, she brought one. Another guest asked for silverware since none is provided to start with. Same thing. She brought one set. Catching on to her skill set, the next time she appeared each guest in our party asked for silverware individually.

We have had excellent meal experiences while in Madison. Unfortunately, this was not one of them."}
{"text":"I had the California Burger. It was good but not excellent, and certainly not the best burger in Madison. I went with three other people and they agreed. We should have went to Five Guys."}
{"text":"The best burger I've eaten. I've only been here once, but I tried the \"melting pot\" burger and it was scrumptious! A must try restaurant for burger lovers."}
{"text":"I love visiting Dotty Dumpling's Dowry! Their rosemary chicken is to die for! On Fridays they have one of the best fish frys in Madison and the portion is quite large. It's a great place to go and relax BUT don't forget to order the fried mushrooms with the english garlic sauce."}
{"text":"I was in town, passing through on vacation, and saw a review somewhere else that this spot had the best beer & burgers in town.  I was really happy with my meal, and the service too!

We stopped for lunch on a weekday, so not too many people were there. We tried the chili (spicy), which is more like a spicy beef stew - too spicy for him (I didn't mind), but I was missing a chili flavor and consistency I am used to with chili.  He had the mushroom & swiss, which he adored.  I had a burger with tomato, onion, and a special sauce made of fresh minced jalapenos, garlic and cilantro - very HOT, but good with some sour creme on top. The burgers are juicy and done perfectly, they have lots of options for toppings, plus buffalo, ostrich, chicken and veggie burgers. AND YOU MUST have the fries with the garlic mayo dip - quite delic!

Beer choices seemed good, and I love a place that features local brews - we had some New Glarus and Ale Asylum styles, and bought a couple New Glarus/Dollys pint glasses too. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. We had a great time!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers and an excellent beer selection. What more could one ask for? How about a very friendly staff, chill atmosphere and cool decor (including the creepy dolls above the bar)."}
{"text":"Good burgers and beer. Great atmosphere and friendly environment. Try the bison burger and ask them to put blue cheese on it."}
{"text":"There on a weeknight at 9 pm.  After being seated we waited 20 minutes for service which I flagged down.   Service is one star. Burgers three stars; bun cold.  Onion rings burnt.   Too bad they are resting on their laurels."}
{"text":"Now that I'm on Yelp, I can finally review this place like it deserves.  Dotty's burgers are one of the few things I crave and miss about Madison, WI.  A friend brought me here when I first arrived in Wisconsin, and I consistently went back over the next six years.  All friends that I have brought there absolutely love it.  The setting is ambient, it has a very traditional bar feel to it with wooden seats and high tables.  The atmosphere fits into a variety of styles, which is probably why it is such a popular place to go for a large demographic of people.  I have had friends who had their first date here, which is strange considering you're trying to carry a conversation while chomping down on a messy burger.

The food is phenomenal.  I always split an appetizer sampler with a friend and got a Melting Pot burger, though I pretty much have had all the burgers on their menu at one point or another.  The burgers tend to be cooked more than what you ask, so if you want an actual medium burger, I would ask for a medium-rare.  I like my burgers medium-well, so it wasn't a huge problem for me.  The Melting Pot is edible without any additional condiments, as the English garlic sauce is pretty much heaven in a bun.  The burger patties are tender.  If you want to be a little more fancy, I'd highly recommend getting a bison burger.  You can sub the regular beef patty with a bison patty in any of their signature burgers for a slight fee.  All their burgers are top-notch and are among the best burgers I have ever had, but they tend to get messy since the buns are fluffy and soft.  I loved their buns, but I know some prefer their burgers to be in buns that are a little more firm.

The sampler is hit or miss depending on who is frying them, but that only means it varies in degrees of deliciousness.  The cheese curds are some of the best bar curds I've ever had in Madison.  The fried mushrooms are great with the garlic sauce, though they might not be for some because they're very hot and filled with grease.  The mac and cheese wedges are probably my favorite, and you can dip them in just about anything to add some flavor.  The fries are fairly average, and the onion rings tend to be the most unpopular thing there since they have thick breading and are huge.

They have a decent beer list for a diner-pub.  I would not recommend going when there are events around campus, as this place tends to be packed.  They also only serve a limited menu for Kohl Center events, and it is much better to be able to choose something special off their regular menu instead."}
{"text":"I won't say that these are the best burgers I've EVER had (for that, Kuma's Corner in Chicago is still my go-to) but they really are quite good.  And messy...which I think is important with any good burger.  I ordered the Runnelstone per the waitresses suggestion and was not disappointed with my burger.   I don't remember what all everyone else ordered but there were no burgers left on the table at the end of the meal.  

We also ordered the sample basket to share between the 4 of us.  I was with 3 other guys who, after the basket arrived, insisted that the basket wasn't big enough.  I was actually really glad we got the basket because I didn't think their fries were anything great but I LOVED the fried macaroni and cheese.  Plus there were fried mushrooms and fried cheese curds.  I mean, why choose one fried thing when you can have FOUR different kinds in one great basket!  I have to think that the others agreed with me because I don't actually remember people finishing the fries.  Also, I really liked the English Garlic sauce.  This sauce is on quite a few burgers so maybe this isn't the prime place to eat on a Friday night before you go out to meet a bunch of people you've never met before but we went for it anyway.

Another fun thing about this place is that they have a decent selection of beers --some Wisconsin ones and some otherwise.  I would recommend the Wisconsinite if they have that when you go.  Quite tasty! 

If I was rating the food alone, I would probably give the place 5 stars but our waitress wasn't that great which was why I knocked off a star.   Even though she provided burger suggestions, any requests for sauces or frosty glasses (even though she ASKED if we wanted a frosty glass) took a while for her to get to.  I'm more forgiving if the restaurant is packed...but it wasn't."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you. There is not a dumpling in sight at Dotty's Dumpling Dowry. Came here for a late late lunch or super early dinner on a Sunday after flying into town and the waitress was helpful and friendly, although she couldn't explain the origins of the name.  However, that didn't matter after a shared order of cheese curds and a mushroom cheeseburger were consumed with the local brewed root beer. The cheese curds were not overly battered and had a lovely texture. The root beer was better than any national chain can offer. I always fall for a local brewed soda."}
{"text":"Dotty's is one of my favorite places in Madison. Their Rolls Royce and Lamburgers are one of my favorite foods!"}
{"text":"DDD is a mainstay of Madison and you can't go wrong stopping for a bite to eat or just a drink. They wait staff is friendly and service impeccable. Its a bit dark on the inside for me, but if you are going for dinner it has a nice intimate atmosphere. You can eat at the bar or in a booth which is wonderful.

The burgers are good because they have a variety of toppings, but in my opinion the Old Fashioned Burger surpasses anything that DDD serves. You also do not get fries with your burger here, and will tack on an unnecessary expense. On the other hand the Sampler Platter is a basket of deep fried goodness and WILL take more than one person to finish.

They serve boots here so if you are looking to have a communal drinking experience you can find it at DDD. Its also close to the rest of downtown if you don't feel like walking to capitol square."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place is known for \"The Best Burgers in Madison\" gross. Worst burger of my life. So sloppy and greasy. I took one bite of the burger and I couldn't/wouldn't eat the rest of it. The best part of this experience was the eye-candy (the guy that looks like Clarence Greenwood of Citizen Cope)  Bottom line....the burgers here are gross."}
{"text":"For some reason between the yelp reviews and the website, I thought this place would be more... dumpy. The interior is very inviting, with high wooden booths and low lights. I just wanted cheese curds ($5.50) and a cup of soup ($2.95) (I got the jambalaya), and he ordered the ostrich burger ($7.25). As mentioned previously, the burgers don't come with any sides, so the two of us rang up $20 including tax/tip for our light dinner. The curds were good (though I think the Old Fashioned wins this battle), and the jambalaya was nicely seasoned with large chunks of tomatoes and peppers. The ostrich burger was overcooked and dry. I think my curiosity is sated for now."}
{"text":"If 10 stars was an option, I'd give them 20. The burgers were amazing. I'd venture to say best I've had. Cooked to perfection with fresh meat (bison med rare). My mouth wanted to keep eating but my belly had no more room.  Also great draft list and prices. Don't hesitate, go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Madison!  Always good and always fast service!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I am in town for work and in the taxi from the airport, the driver recommended several local spots to try. After seeing this was high on the list here, I went with a coworker for dinner.  It is fairly dark inside. There are TVs that were playing older shows or movies (black and white era... Maybe 50s?) The music was all from the same era, the 4 seasons, etc. The booth was all wood, no padding, but not really uncomfortable. There was a small light at the end of the booth opposite the entry point that we both had to use to read the menu. We both ordered the Heart Throb which is spicy, but tasty. It had pepper jack cheese, bacon and a jalapeño cream cheese spread.  The burger was perfectly cooked and the bun was very soft. The burgers come alone and we ordered one side of fries to share. The fries were plain, just a little salt. We did order the garlic mayo sauce to dip the fries, which was tasty as well. Neither of us had alcohol, but I had an unsweetened iced tea which was as expected. The total bill for both of us was about $24 which is a good price, in my opinion, for a downtown meal.

Was this the best burger of my life (as advertised)? No. But it was tasty and perfectly cooked. They definitely know what they are doing over there. If I'm in town again, I would go back."}
{"text":"Melting pot and cheese curds are the shit. No kidding. 
Great location and environment. Servers are very friendly. Just wish they could serve a little more efficiently."}
{"text":"Maybe not the best burgers ANYWHERE, but definitely the best I've had in Madison.  My only problem with this place is that I haven't gone here enough!

The burgers were messy, glorious tributes to the meat Gods.  The appetizers (we plowed through two sampler baskets and an extra basket of fries) were good -- especially the amazing cheese curds.  They also have good vegetarian options and can make any burger on their menu with a veggie patty.  They also have buffalo and \"Kobe\" beef options available (though I call BS on the Kobe beef since it's not actually legal to sell REAL Kobe beef in the US -- go google it!)

Service was attentive, but not annoying, and any problems (one burger was missing guacamole) were quickly taken care of.  We had a larger party and yet there were no major snafus, which seems to be a minor miracle these days.  We brought our own dessert (my birthday cake!) and they were completely accomodating about it.

Definitely, one of my top places to eat in Madison."}
{"text":"Dottys had quit a bit of mixed reviews but i think it hands down deserves a four.  the reason i gave it a four and not a five is that i felt like the beef was not very tender or seasoned.  even considering that, the generous amount of cheese and delicious bun, sauce, and pickles are top notch!  It was one of the best burgers. ever.  i just had one bite of pure beef and didnt feel like it was great.  to be fair im not really into the charbroiled flavor so if you are this place will rock your socks off!  Atmosphere is also amazing."}
{"text":"Onion rings are average but if you want your mind blown, get the mac n' cheese wedges.  Life changing."}
{"text":"This place is great. Great atmosphere, great food, and the service was prompt and friendly. Can't go wrong with any of the fried cheese items on the menu, and the burger was excellent. The chili was nothing special, but the root beer float was outstanding. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"If the rating were based solely on food and beer selection, I'd give them five stars. But since the service is generally pretty poor, especially at the bar, I'm knocking it down to four. 
I love to build my own burger, but also enjoy the California from time to time. The potato salad is my favorite EVER! I can't walk in the door of that place without drooling at the simple thought of it. It would be nice if sides were included with the sandwiches, but they're certainly worth the extra few bucks. Love the heartthrob sauce, especially with the deep fried mushrooms.
As I said before, they have a great beer selection. Both on tap and bottled. Any place with a hefty tap beer selection is awesome in my book. 
Love the dark, cozy atmosphere of the booths and the restaurant in general. 
I do wish the servers were slightly more attentive and the bartenders friendlier, but I have a feeling they simply don't give a shit. They know you're gonna like the food.
**Update: We continue to visit Dotty's because we love the food and the beer selection. However, the service just keeps getting worse. Condescending, eye-rolling, fake nice=not cool. We won't return for awhile."}
{"text":"if you are a vegetarian, do not go here. Don't be fooled by the \"vegan, vegetarian\" tag. It's a burger joint with a black bean burger option, which was served COLD.  i had to eat my burger with a fork because the patty fell apart immediately and the service was so slow it took forever to even get silverware."}
{"text":"Yay!  I'm so glad that after not visiting a couple years Dotty's is still the excellent burger joint that I remember.  For about $7 bucks you can get a perfectly cooked medium rare beefy burgers with some gourmet ingredients.  I had their goat burger with goat cheese and basil.  Nice combination.  Their cheese curds are awesome.  Fries are a pass - they're the frozen kind.  Overall a great cheap eats place that I'll visit every time I'm in Madison"}
{"text":"Owned by one of the most stubborn business owners ever to ruffle the feathers of a city council, Dotty Dumpling's Dowry serves a pretty good meal.  You gotta love their moxie for sticking around after getting forced out of two locations (so far).  

Be prepared for the complimentary heart attack that comes with every fifth meal.

You can order their specialty burgers or build your own.  The fried sides are shamelessly bad for you and the service is good enough.  Stop in for a bite before the \"big game,\" or if you're looking for a tall burger to start your night off right."}
{"text":"The burgers are absolutely delicious. Only downfall is the burgers do not include a side of fries."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  The burgers were so good.  The Melting Pot Burger is as good as it sounds.  I was a big fan of the cheese curds as well.  Very lightly breaded and fried fresh.  When they got to the table, they just melted in your mouth.  The decor is a lot of fun.  There is a little bit of everything and you should wander (it's not too large of a place) to check out all the things the owner has collected.  It is a mixture of sports, local flair, and cool memorabilia.  I will definitely be going back again next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Five of us went here Saturday night before the hockey game.  I had only been to the old location one other time.  The new location is very nice, but it's very small.  Our burgers were very good, but the cheese curds were awesome.  I was unhappy I had to share the curds w/ everyone else.  The only kind of annoying thing was as we were waiting for our last round before heading over to the Kohl Center, the hostess came over to \"remind\" us about the 1 hr. table policy on game nights.  Um, usually a reminder implies someone previously informed you of something.   And I totally understand the reason for it, but considering how slow our service was, I didn't think we should have to inhale our food and run.  Not that I'm blaming our waitress.  She was clearly busy, but accordingly, we should get a few minutes to enjoy ourselves!  

Overall we all really enjoyed ourselves.  It's a great option if you've been to the Gritty a few too many times before heading over to the hockey game.  Oh, and I drove my car 140 miles to see the hockey game so you know I was hungry!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to write a review on Yelp, but never had the motivation. I found it tonight.

Visiting Dotty's for a burger or a beer is one of my favorite things to do. Tonight, I switched things up and ordered their Lemon & Herb Chicken. After two bites of the sandwich, I noticed it was extremely salty. My wife took a bite and confirmed it.

I flagged down our waitress and politely explained the sandwich was too salty and asked to have a new one without the herbs and less salt. She was pleasant and without hesitation took the sandwich away with the promise of replacing it. Less than a minute later she returned with the SAME sandwich and informed me that the manager had instructed her that they wouldn't replace it, but that I could BUY a second sandwich because half of it was consumed. 

I responded by asking to speak with said manager. Moments later, Rachael Stanley, the general manager, appeared at our table and repeated that she couldn't replace the sandwich because half of it was eaten, but could sell me another one. I was dumbfounded and dismayed, but didn't relent. 

She soon offered to replace it for no charge. 

As I see it, there is no way to justify what happened. I'm confident when I write that I've never been treated so unfairly. Even if I was a jerk, which I wasn't; and even if I ate half, which I hadn't; no customer should ever be told they can buy a replacement for an item that was unsatisfactory. 

The final insult was that Rachael and the waitress didn't acknowledge their error with an apology after the fact. But I take solace in knowing that when they reads this, cringing, they'll resolve never to treat a customer so poorly again."}
{"text":"I've loved Dotty's since my first visit when it was on Regent Street.  Always excellent burgers and perfect fries.  Their cheese curds are also some of the best.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I came into the experience with a very high expectation, as nearly everyone that had recommended the restaurant gave rave reviews. The burger selection seemed to be quite extensive, and as a fairly selective eater, I opted for the safe-bet honey mustard burger. I also ordered the sampler platter to get a good feel for their deep-fried selections. Overall the burger was ok. It was fairly soggy, but the sauce was good. It definitely didn't leave me pining for more. The cheese curds were good (but they seem to be delicious no matter where you are), and the fries were fairly soggy. Overall, it was a fairly pedestrian experience at a premium price. I wouldn't avoid the restaurant if friends demanded it, but at the same time, I wouldn't seek it out either."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Excellent assortment of draft beer. Hopalious, beer made in Madison, was delicious   I love burgers,  and their burger may be the best I ever had."}
{"text":"This has become a family ritual for me and my son when he stays with me over the summer.  We eat here the day he arrives so that he can get his first hit of the BEST cheese curds and deep fried mac and cheese EVER and then we have lunch on the day he leaves to help him make it to December before he can get his curds fix again!"}
{"text":"We were in town for the weekend and were looking for a solid cheeseburger to get the afternoon started.  Kicked things off with the cheese curds - absolutely a must.  The GF and I are sluts for the salty, pillowy deliciousness that is a fine, fried curd.
I went with the \"Alumni\" which is basically a cheeseburger with a special sauce on it (guessing A1, mayo, and a little something else).  The burger itself was done perfectly medium and overall it was a nice combination of flavors.  Definitely steaky.
The lady built her own cheeseburger with onions and mushrooms.  Also very solid.  
Overall, You probably cant go wrong with any of the burger options.  They definitely live up to their reputation."}
{"text":"Ein sehr gutes Restaurant.
Es ist bekannt für die besten Burger in ganz Madison und dem ist auch so!

Der beste Burger, den ich jemals gegessen habe.
Hier komme ich sehr gerne wieder hin.

Die Preise waren durchschnittlich."}
{"text":"Had an awesome Lamb Burger there last weekend. The whole family enjoyed their meals as well!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place doesn't have 5!!  Best burgers of my life Ahmahgahsogood for realz, the meat is the best, the cheese on the burger is the best, the mayo is the best and I don't usually even like mayo bc it grosses me out as a concept.  The fries are just fries get the cheese curds!!! We got there close to when it opened for lunch and it was packed out by the time we were leaving..,now I know why.  Mmmmm burgers !!!  Seriously the best, if you are visiting Madison make this a stop on your list."}
{"text":"I've known Jeff and his creation most of my adult life...fantastic use of the grill-a true representation of the iconic burger/bar combination...I have traveled the world and found no equal.  Thank you Jeff for a little American dream with fries!"}
{"text":"I actually like the new location better than the classic. I know, blasphemy, but I find the new place easier to navigate and there's more seating; so it's easier to get seated. And at least they kept some of the most fun decorations, like the model plane.

The burgers are pricey, but worth it since they are heads and tails above most local places. Service is a bit slow, but they all look like undergrads struggling with what is a popular burger joint."}
{"text":"Dotty's has a great atmosphere with cozy wooden booths, but they weren't much to write home about on this visit. I arrived at around 6 pm and they had just filled up. We only waited about 2 minutes to be seated, so busy enough, but not crazy. I ordered the melting pot hamburger, which they have listed as their #1 selling burger. My date ordered the green and gold. The food came out pretty quickly, which would have been great except that it meant my burger was under cooked. I asked for medium, but it came out rare. Blood was dripping from it and the cheese wasn't even melted at all. I could tell that it was probably a great sandwich if it had been cooked long enough to melt the cheese. Unfortunately our waiter didn't come back to check how the food was until after my boyfriend was already finished eating, so we were ready to go and not willing to wait for them to make something else.  He very much enjoyed his burger, though. All told it was a so so visit."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch and it was great. I had melting pot burger and it was fantastic.  F [d was a little pricy but excellently prepared so not such a problem. Very good service and excellent atmosphere"}
{"text":"So, I went here hoping to enjoy a juicy burger bursting with the flavor of a nicely seasoned patty whose toppings complete an unforgettable meal. At least that's what I thought I would get after reading some reviews... But alas the burger was very disappointing. The condiments on the burger were nice. The bun was good. Fries and curds decent though State Street are still the best curds I have tried in town. The fried mac and cheese was fun and yummy. Atmosphere was fun and the service was good. But the BURGER!!!  AWHWH. Disappointing to say the least. There was absolutely no flavor what so every in the meat. It was as if they just formed the patty, grilled, and served. No salt, garlic, pepper, secret something, ANYTHING! 

I know, so dramatic huh. It's just I rarely have the opportunity to go out do to a tight budget and you hate to be let down. So if your looking for a nice beef burger stick to mcdonalds. At least you get what you pay for there. As for any of the other food. Give it a shot, maybe the buffalo burgers or other things are yummy. Will I go back? Probably just to try something else but the beef burgers aren't good. Go to vintage brewery. That was a much better burger.

Have a nice day!"}
{"text":"A visit to Dotty's is best made from 4 to 6 pm weekdays to take advantage of their $2 draft beer happy hour special (be aware that one must sit *at* the bar to get this deal).  Once you grab a seat, you can choose from a variety of beers, including a selection of local Wisconsin brews.

I've mostly come to Dotty for drinks, but Dotty's is known for its burgers and has a diverse menu of the meaty treats, including ostrich, turkey, and veggie burgers.  My burger was good, not necessarily memorable or mindblowing.  Service was adequate, not overly quick, not super slow. Overall, I would recommend Dotty's for whenever the burger, beer, and fries urge descends."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the 1/2 pound cheeseburger with 3 cheeses, bacon, and garlic butter (the secret ingredient). I washed it down with a spotted cow beer which tasted creamy and delicious. Wish I could visit this bar every week. The service was great too."}
{"text":"If you near the university, this is a MUST stop for lunch. Burgers are great, but the deep fried mac n cheese is awesome! I had a bison burger and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I love dotty Dumplings!! Let's start of with a great atmosphere and ambience!! The service was good overall, the food was really good I love there burgers and fries!! It's a great place to hang out with there friends and have a great time!!"}
{"text":"I lived in Madison from 1986 to 1991 and ate at Dotty's maybe 2x a month back then first on Regent  then on Fairchild.  Loved it then, love it now.  Now we live in Cincinnati and make it to Madison once a year.  On our last visit he burgers were great.  The fries were great.  The beer list was better than ever.  But why did they change the chili?  I remember asking Jeff about his chili back in 1990 or so and he said the secret was beef tenderloin, pork tenderloin and NO beans.  The chili was THE best chili anywhere in the universe.  It was always a tough call:  burger or chili...or both?  The chili I got last week was full of beans and ground beef.  Don't get me wrong, it was pretty good chili.  But it was not Dotty's chili.  Anybody else know what I'm talking about?"}
{"text":"Man, what a bummer. My server was awesome - friendly, not fake, attentive without being annoying, and her recommendations were spot-on. My burger was exactly what I was expecting. All good so far...

Then my kids's food came. The corn dog was overlooked; the wiener  was shriveled and dry.  The grilled cheese that I ordered was blackened on the outside and the cheese was cold. When I tried to talk the women in charge of the grill, they were condescending, if not indifferent. After showing them the grill cheese, burnt on the inside, cold on the inside and suggesting that the flattop was too hot; I got an eye roll. BTW, I have spent hundreds of hours working a flattop. 

I didn't share my professional experience but to be blown off was not reassuring when they said they, \"Would keep an eye on them.\" 

Maybe Dotty's is resting on its laurels. Complacency in the food world is not a good thing."}
{"text":"The Melting Pot Burger was the best burger I've ever eaten.  The burger was cooked well and very filling.  The fries are good but are better when paired with thier dipping sauces, a must try.  I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Best burgers period. And best cheese curds. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Wood-paneled walls and booths, classy pub-style decorations, and the lively but cozy and clean atmosphere all make Dotty Dumpling's Dowry a great little hangout. Dotty's serves up ice cold beer and really great fare.  We agreed, in fact, that Dotty's is home to some of the best fried cheese curds in all of Madison.

Other than the cheese, I subbed in a tasty buffalo burger. We enjoyed two side sauces: the English Garlic and the Heart Throb; both delicious.

Warning: the Heart Throb sauce is *really* spicy...LOTS of jalepeño.

This place is consistently among Madison's \"voted best\"; it's clear why."}
{"text":"Looked for the best burgers in Madison, WI and Yelp Reviews highly recommended Dotty Dumpling's Dowry. Thanks, Yelp! 

This is hands-down the best burger place in town. The restaurant has a pleasant atmosphere. Service was great. I visited with a huge appetite with my SO, so we ordered a lot. The Homemade Chili with sour cream and cheese was delightful. It had a tangy flavor, which I'm guessing was a touch of vinegar in the recipe? The Homemade Cornbread was moist and light. No need to eat it with butter! Being from the South, I know good cornbread when it's in front of me.  I ordered the Grand Daddy burger. This definitely filled my burger-fix for the night. My SO ordered the Melting Pot burger, and that lived up to the Yelp reviews! Be prepared to have extra napkins on hand. We shared a jumbo order of fries and finished our journey with the yummy Homemade Fudge Bottom Pie. I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"The burgers are touted as \"world famous\" and I must agree that they are fantastic! I had the special with gouda, bacon and apple. It was outstanding. The bun was really good as well!

I also had the onion rings which were better than average.

My wife had soup which she enjoyed and said that the homemade potato salad was outstanding.

My son gave high marks to his mushroom and swiss  burger.

The atmosphere is very unique, the service was great and the pricing was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Tuesday evening. Out of towner. Close to the hotel with good reviews...awesome 10.99 bison burger. Complaint is this....got a \"side\" of cheese curds to go with said bison burger. That side of cheese curds cost 7.50...grrrrr! Would have been nice had the server mentioned that the side of curds was almost the same price as a bison burger with the fixings....and it was a small side definitely not worth the price paid. Nuf' said. Buyer beware. Burger and a beer. Don't fall for the \"sides\"! Paid my bill and left. Will return but won't be fooled by a server again at Dotty's (bartender)."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday night and sat at the bar.  I ordered a beer and pondered the menu.  Yes they have amazing burgers but I ordered the Cow Girl Salad.  Yes I understand the irony and perhaps the double entendres.  I digress.  My bartender Harris was fantasizing.  This guy was Johnny in the spot, informative, helpful, and just all around a cool cat.  So the next day I'm strolling down the street.  I see Harris and he recognizes me and stops to say hello and asked if I was enjoying my visit to Madison and whether I had any questions of where else to go while in town.  Seriously that was amazing and totally unexpected.  Who does that?  Clearly this guy cares about people and is just a genuinely good guy.  While at Dotty'sI also had the chance to interact with the manager (I think) she too was amazingly helpful and informative.  Good work Dotty's for hiring such great people."}
{"text":"So everyone raves about the burgers here...which are to die for but I must say...the daily soups beat all! I never order soup at a restaurant unless its at Dotty's.  They are all homemade and my personal favorite is the Brat and Beer Cheese soup...it's absolutely heavenly...should be a regular in the menu! Also had a beer flight with my soup which made it even better (which I didn't know was possible)!  

Let's just say I never have to buy soup at the grocery store again because I can just go to Dotty's for my daily soup fix!"}
{"text":"Completely delicious and horribly unhealthy!  A wonderful treat and my kids LOVE it!"}
{"text":"The melting pot burger is delicious and just perfect. Quite literally feels like it just melts in your mouth. My favorite burger joint in Madison. I'm not a fan of the interior design and dark lighting and usually order for pick up."}
{"text":"The burger here is consistently excellent and is one of my favorites (if not my favorite). I would always make a point of stopping here when I visited, and now that I live here, I plan to stop by more often.  However, as another reviewer pointed out, the place has lost some of it's ambiance since moving from it's original location. It seems more of a game day hang out than the more more family friendly spot it used to be before I had a family. Finally I am only giving 4-stars since they should probably start including a fly swatter with the utensils. The number of flies present on my last visit (back in June) was disturbing to say the least. Still I will overlook that for the time being and hope that they remediate this issue."}
{"text":"YUM! Those sauces are all really good. I got all of them on the side to dip my fries in and they were so so so good, I preferred all of them to the usual fry toppings.
Great ambience, friendly service, general good burger-and-fry-dom. What else is there to say?"}
{"text":"Stopped in during a trip back home to Madison. I remember Dotty's when it was on State Street...used to go as a kid for their amazing burgers and shakes. And waffle fries? Can't remember that far back but may have been my introduction to waffle fries. Anyhoo. Loved the old knick knacks and antiques displayed all over and hanging from the high ceilings.  Was disappointed when it moved to its new location, because I loved that old ambiance. But still has great food and awesome selection of local beer...the type I brag about to my friends who have not been fortunate enough to experience Wisconsin and its brewed offerings. The dark wood, semi private booths, old time music, and soft lighting make this a pleasant place for a meal or a beer. Highly recommend. Glad I stopped in to reminisce."}
{"text":"Cheese curds are great, highly recommend. 
Above average ranch sauce. 

I do not recommend the veggie  burger, I've had great veggie burgers before  and this is not one of them. It simply tasted like beans and nothing else."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed when I walked in to Dotty Dumpling's Dowry was the flat screens playing an old film noir, at that moment I was really hoping this would turn out to be a place I could love.  Sadly, it's not.  For starters the service was pretty poor.  For instance when the server asked if we'd like our appetizer with the meal or before hand we told her we'd like it well before the meal.  It came out 1 minute before the sandwiches.  And the end of the meal is the only time I was asked if I'd like a refill and we still had half of the appetizer basket left when we were done and the server never asked if we wanted a box to go.  Oh and we were never asked if everything was ok after the food arrived,  I could go on....
As far as the food goes the cheese curds were actually very good and prepared exactly how cheese curds really should be and the rest of the appetizer stuff was all pretty good as well.  Unfortunately though it appears they just use Gardenburgers for their veggie burger alternative, either that or they make very bland veggie burgers.  I'd prefer to go to Monty's and get a Trempealeau Walnut burger.  Also I'm sick of all the restaurants sharing the tired random antique shit thrown on the walls motif, half a dozen chains use look exactly the same so perhaps the small local restaurants could be a little more original.
I may try this place one more time in the future but I'm not so sure.
Ah one more thing, for the price why don't burgers and sandwiches come with friggin fries?!"}
{"text":"The burgers were great, and the servers let us customize the burger to our hearts content. They were also super patient with us as we took about 15 minutes to decide what to order.  The burger was cooked well, they added a generous helping of veggies to our burgers, and overall it tasted great!"}
{"text":"been eating and drinking at dotty's for many many years. it's not necessary the most comfortable space (pretty small, and can get pretty crowded depending on what events are going on nearby. BUT the food is good, the look is classy, and the students working there are nice And it's an easy place to get drinks and food before or after hitting up other spots downtown!

They have been around for a long long time well before I was born, so if they are still running strong... then they're doing something right.

This is definitely a popular landmark of the Madison downtown scene; in walking distance to everything downtown.

definitely recommended :)

oh, if they still have it... try the ostrich burger, scary sounding, but was yum"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is so cozy and cute and perfect. It was better than expected, frankly. And even though DDD has apparently moved several times since opening 45 years ago, the place looks old-school while not being worn out. Loved the bar and especially loved the array of great beers. Note: some of them are not on the menu, so ask if you don't see your favorite! I'm not a meat eater at all, but on occasion I do indulge in a bison burger (lived in Colorado for 10 years), so I was happy to see that DDD has one. I had been warned by family who live in Madison to order the burger well done, because they're received fairly raw burgers before there. Well, I normally get bison medium, which is how it's supposed to be cooked, but on their warning, I got medium well. Trust me, it was almost charred. So I didn't love that. It must vary with cooks or something but next time, I'll order it the way I like it and if it is raw, I'll send it back. In any case, despite the way it was cooked, it was very decent in every way, especially with the wild mushrooms. Their salads are huge and their fries kind of need salting, but overall, a very fun experience. The great ending to this meal was the strawberry milkshake, which was PERFECTLY executed and served in a classic DDD pint glass. This is definitely a fun, friendly and enjoyable Madison institution with something for everyone."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Dotty's in a long time, but not anymore!  I don't usually give 5's as perfection is needed, but I'm giving one here, it is just that good.

Love the comfortable wooden booths, and the music is just at the right volume; you can hear it and also talk over it.  Who wants a place where the music is so intrusive that you can't hear what you dinner companion is saying.  There are always 24 beers on tap, many of them microbrews. 

You can build your own burgers or pick a burger designed by Dottie's.  I chose The Bayou as I love Cajun food. The wife picked The Melting Pot, as she loves cheese and lots of it. Both of us loved our burgers.  The one downside was the bun, very good except wasn't quite up to the juicy meat and sort of disinigrated by the last couple of bites.  But no matter as plenty of napkins were available.

The regular size basket of fries were more than adequate for the two of us and they were cooked perfectly.

In no way can anyone put these burgers in the same league as \"5 Guys\", they are far and away superior.  The care in cooking, very nice seating and music, everything was totally superior to \"that other place\" which I made the mistake of going to a few weeks ago.

Dottie's is in the upper echelon of burger places in Southern Wisconsin.  I can see why year after year it wins \"Best of Madison\".  Wow! This is THE place for a good burger folks."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review of Dotty's yet!

We have bee coming here since we were students. Note that everything is a la cart but if you get a basket of jumbo fries ($3.99), you'll have enough for two plus leftovers.

Also, if you don't fancy any snazzy toppings, the Build Your Own Burger is a safe and affordable bet for you.

The only reason it doesn't have 5 stars in my book is the service can be spotty sometimes. But that's expected when the median age of the servers are in their 20s. 

Seating can be hard to come by during special sporting events and the wait can be as long as an hour since the place is far from expansive. If you are in a hurry and sport a seat at the bar, grab it and they'll serve you there. I've had some great service from the bartenders.

I have a fond memory of my Home Ec teacher reminiscing about the time she worked there. She said everything is made fresh daily, about how the buns and produces are sourced locally.

If you're not into beef, they have an \"Adventurous\" menu with veggie patties, chicken sandwiches, and burgers made with bison, lamb, or turkey.

Check their website for specials which COMES WITH fries and a fountain drink."}
{"text":"Very solid place to grab a burger. Portions are huge. Be prepared to wait on game days or weekends."}
{"text":"Just the name is ridiculous and awesome.  But the food is really good, too.

This was a fave among my husband's UW-Madison grad school friends.  And why not?  It's close to campus, it's a bar but is not ONLY a bar, they play sports and sometimes old movies with the sound turned off (why?), and the service isn't terrible.

It's THISCLOSE to being terrible sometimes.  But most of the time it's ok.  The burgers are delish and there are many to choose from, including veggie, turkey, and bison!  Salads are big, and the fact that they even exist in an establishment that features fried cheese curds and onion rings is a big plus.  Dotty's is like \"Madison-fare Plus.\"  They have all the standards but can make the women happy too.

Blue Mooooooon on tap.  Seals the deal."}
{"text":"Went here with my dad after some Badger Hockey, cool atmosphere with some really relaxed people in it. Our waitress could have been a little friendlier but maybe it was one of those nights... They have cool stuff on the ceilings and walls just some old school model planes and baseball cards and such. We had some burgers which were some good-ol-fashioned greasy burgers. We had the Build your Own which was great to see! Reasonably priced and seemed to have a good beer selection. OH! for reference haha, there are two blimps near the kitchen on in which is a replica of the Hindenburg I believe, anyways our family friend built both of them which I thought was pretty interesting. Anyways great place to go to grab some grub!"}
{"text":"Everyone I know would rate this as the number one burger place to go to in Madison (and I grew up in Madison).  You can clearly see that these are handmade patties that are cooked to order.  We've never been disappointed in the amount of cooking specified, either.  All sides are typically amazing.  We love the sausage jambalaya, and this recipe is pretty authentic, as I have a recipe that tastes the same from a friend who actually lives in a Louisiana bayou.  The only thing we haven't enjoyed is the shrimp jambalaya since the shrimp are usually mushy and fishy.  Only other complaint is that the buns for the chicken sandwich are different than what the serve with the burgers and are dry.  Otherwise, amazing place to eat if you're looking for a burger!"}
{"text":"Very good burger and fries. I am fine with a medium \"pink\" burger when it is quality beef, which this is, but I'd say mine was more like medium rare or even rare in spots. That's a little much for me when it comes to burgers. Thus I knocked a star off the rating. 

I like the ambiance and the booths felt private and cozy, which was nice for a rare lunch date with my husband. The sauces are yummy! I loved the English mayonnaise and my husband really liked an jalapeño cheddar sauce. We dipped our fries in them and they also come on many of the burgers. 

Prices are a bit high for burgers but they are very good, so, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome place for a premium burger, beer and fries! Black and blue burger medium rare is must.

Classic bar and grill layout. The server was incredible friendly and competent. 

Chatted with the owner and his daughter who manages the place. Both are very relaxed, funny and nice. Mr \"Dotty\" was a bit of a character.

Great location near the campus. Definitely a keeper on the Madison short list."}
{"text":"If you're in Madison, you cannot pass this great restaurant up.
As soon as we came in the door, we were greeted warmly, and seated immediately, then left to peruse the menu at our own pace. Our waitress, Becca, was friendly and cheerful the entire time, and complimented me on my burger choice! Their menu is diverse and interesting, with a build-your-own-burger option that I ordered (with Feta, Cheddar, and Mozzarella, and their pesto and garlic sauce, it's great, try it). The meal was not disappointing. The cheese curds were traditional Wisconsin curds (try again, Culver's), and the Mac and Cheese Wedges, although using Kraft, made an experience I won't forget soon. The pickles that came with the burger were refreshing, and I loved every bite.
The atmosphere was that of a family restaurant- the music was funk disco, the tables were wooden, the chatting was, well, chatty, and the overall experience was amazing.
The only drawbacks I experienced were my burger being undercooked- it was still pink in the middle, and I requested cooked through- and the lighting, which made the place fairly dark and small-looking. Besides that, amazing restaurant. Would come here again."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time tonight. It was my husband and me, our five year-old, and our 1 year-old. I would say that DDD is kid friendly but not really baby friendly. No high chair seemed to be available, and you can't eat a greasy, drippy burger while holding a wiggly toddler. However, the food was amazing. We started off with a strawberry shake that had a fabulous flavor and a deliciously smooth texture. Next we had a sampler basket. The fried mushrooms, onion rings, and mac 'n cheese wedges were fantastic. The fries were okay. The English garlic sauce was very flavorful. 

I had the Toadstool burger, and it was perfect. I would not change a thing. It was cooked exactly as I requested, and I was sorry when it was gone. My husband had the Melting Pot burger. He enjoyed it very much. 

Our food arrived fast, almost too fast. I would've liked more time to enjoy the appetizer before our main entrees, because you end up with the conundrum of not wanting your burger to get cold, but then the appetizer gets cold. Also, at the end of our meal, it took a bit long for the waitress to bring our check. 

Overall, I was very impressed. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was our first stop to try the famous cheese curds, totally happy with them!! The service was good and the first cocktail in the menu that I forgot the name of was amazing. It was a drink with bourbon and ginger beer, it was off the chain!! I will totally go back there for a snack and a drink next time."}
{"text":"Burgers and curds are killer! Turkey burger was juicy and the herbs/spices really jump out at you. The cheese curds...ohhh the curds! Crispy and dangerous haha. Fun, cozy atmosphere.

@couchtocafe (YouTube, Twitter, facebook, snapchat)."}
{"text":"I've lived in Madison for years but have never tried Dotties. I cannot believe what I have been missing! We started with poutine and 3 of us had burgers and one person had the fish fry. The burgers were so good. I had a make your own with blue cheese and onion straws. Seriously melt in your mouth good. Poutine was the best I've ever had. Something about the sausage gravy. Fish fry was good, not great, but the tartar sauce was excellent. Service was very good too. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I came in pretty late one weekday evening while in Madison for business. I tried one of the signature burgers and it was good. I don't eat burgers often, but when I do I want something special. This was a worthwhile burger. I had one of the local brews on draft, which paired really well with the burger.

The service left quite a bit to be desired, however. I was seated at the bar and the bartender/waitress was mostly interested in hanging out at the back end of the bar, flirting with a cook, and paid little attention to me or the couple other guests. If the burger/beer hadn't been so good, I'd give this a lower rating, but I guess a \"4\" meal and \"2\" service balances out at a rating of \"3.\" Overall, I guess I'll probably try another venue on my next Madison visit, but the burgers here are really tasty."}
{"text":"Outstanding burgers, beer and service!! We sat at the bar and we couldn't ask for a better time.  The Melting pot for our burgers and we did the 4 samplers for beer. Spotted Cow is a win win!"}
{"text":"The burgers were fantastic, the service was good and the prices were very reasonable.  I got the Melting Pot Burger with pickles and ranch and my hubby and I split the cheese curds (which were to die for).  They make their own Ranch, and boy can you tell.  It was delicious and I was practically licking the bottom of the bowl.  Their English garlic sauce might scare some people off, but you can barely taste the garlic; it doesn't overpower you at all.  It was a little dark, but we went for dinner, so it created a nice atmosphere.  The server was very friendly and the food came out fast.  They have a good beer selection, especially if you like micro-brews.  Overall, I would definitely come  again.  The one complaint I have is that the burgers don't come with fries."}
{"text":"Great burgers, and the fried mushrooms are truly amazing.  I was a fan of the pub's decor. When we went for lunch on Saturday it was relatively quiet and we got a seat at a window booth quite easily.  Our waitress was super helpful in giving recommendations and checking in on us, as part of our group arrived slightly late.

Took off a star because the burgers are a little unwieldy and I definitely had trouble finishing mine.  The bottom bun was on the soggy side, unfortunately.  The mushrooms my friend ordered made up for it though; since there were about 7 she insisted on sharing.

There's a parking garage across the street that's not too expensive, if you are driving in.

Overall, had a super fun lunch date with some friends here!  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Dotty's has a solid selection of burgers and beers.  I recommend the Heart Throb, which was pleasantly spicy.  If you can't find a burger that meets your fancy, the build-your-own selection should remedy that problem.  The burgers are cooked medium-rare, which, in my opinion, is the most delicious, but they will happily cook them well-done if you wish.  An order of fries is large enough to split between two people.  

Dotty's has interesting decor and the booths are dark and private.  On a Friday night, though, be prepared for a 20-30 minute wait.  Service was about average.  A must visit for any burger lovers who find themselves in Madison."}
{"text":"As others have said, great burgers! I was just here again and ordered the cheese curds as well, which are some of the best I have had. The biggest downside is their burgers don't come with sides. So for a Burger and a side you are in about $10. Kinda pricy for what you get. I enjoy the atmosphere, but it can be a little tight. But most places in that area are. They do a good job and if they included sides with their burgers they would get 5 stars."}
{"text":"Food poisoning.
Visiting Madison, WI where my girlfriend went to undergrad. After a community nonprofit event, we were both a little hungry so she suggested one of her old grease pits from her college days on campus. It was 9:55p, 5 minutes before the kitchen closes (even though they are open until 11p). We order quick, taking in the hipster scenery and Midwest history. Our food arrives and it's your typical bar food, but we are here more for the nostalgia.
Now it is the middle of the night, we are both up, stomach twisting out of our guts, while we fight wave after wave of nausea. 
It may be because we came in last minute before the kitchen closed? Regardless, this late night snack is putting a damper on our stay in WI."}
{"text":"Fiancée and I have been on a search for some good burgers lately and have been wanting to try Dotty's for a while now. Definitely need to get here wary as it fills up very quickly. We ordered take out and it was ready in under 15 minutes and the burgers were delicious!"}
{"text":"Dotty's is the best place to eat before Badger game at the Kohl Center! If you can find parking and get there early enough..
Whenever I've gone and been able to grab a seat, I've enjoyed my time. I usually go for a burger as it is their claim to fame. They have those normal, wonderful bar cheese curds that are a staple here in Madison.
This place is great for people who are looking to talk to strangers, (for both game & nongame days) because it's usually crowded and very loud, but that one of the best parts of game days right?"}
{"text":"Looking for a heart attack? Here's one deliciously unhealthy place to go to for an out-of-state person! My colleague and I decided to check this place out after a lot of people recommended it...known for its fried cheese curd and fried mac-n-cheese appetizer!

The service was fairly good and quick...Apparently this place is well known for its burgers but I was too enamoured by it's fried appetizers... fried mac-n-cheese wedges were absolutely out of the world...fried cheese curds was good too...as were the fried mushrooms! 

All in all, an AWESOME place to try the food unique to Wisconsin...I don't think I could go to this place on a regular basis though...it would just be a pre-cursor to a heart attack!!!"}
{"text":"Best Burgers in Madison Basil mozzarella is my all time favorite. The pesto is amazing. Fries are crispy and soft. Wonderful date night place."}
{"text":"An amazing place for burgers in Madison! I got the Gambler burger which was delicious, but I also head the Melting Pot is amazing. The atmosphere was perfect for a rainy day--it was lively, dimly lit, and cozy. I would definitely recommend taking visitors here!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong this place was yummy, but I ordered the special there, five cheeses on a burger, and my chest hurt.  It's really my fault.  It was just too much.  My husband had the toadstool which was to die for.  Have to love mushrooms that's all I have to say.  They were perfectly seasoned and I'm still drooling over it, and the cheese curds were absolutely delicious. The service was superb, she really wanted to help out as much as possible.  The bartender was really too accommodating, I wanted a shake with liquor.  They had the liquor, they had the shakes.  I was willing to pay.  It was a new form of lazy.  I actually felt bad for my server, because she was the messenger.  On a positive note, my husband got an awesome microbrew that he loved.  I'm sorry I can't remember the name, magic hat? Something in that sense.  All in all a-ok, try it out!"}
{"text":"Despite knowing of it's existence forever, had never made it to Dotty's - coming from Milwaukee to head to the Kohl, we usually make use of one of the establishments that will shuttle us over so we don't pay for parking. 

This evening we had to be in the neighborhood early, so we snagged close $5 parking and packed into Dotty's with the rest of the pre-hockey crowd. Despite the large crowd and hectic nature of the whole thing, loved how cool and collected the wait staff is. 

Burgers were really good - smokey with just a little char. Big and juicy. Was a little disappointed in my choice, but that was my fault, not the burgers. The patty itself was fine, but I should have gone with gooey cheese and bacon and om nom nom. 

Basket of fries to share was fine between three. Food came quickly, beers flowed and we made it in plenty of time for the game.

Great experience, would recommend and go back. What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Pros: 
Amazing burgers!
Great mayo-y sauces (English garlic is awesome)
Excellent fried cheese curds, with a nice light batter
OK salads for appetizer/meal options
Fast service
Brass badger doorknob is badass

Cons:
Egg not offered as a topping (this takes the place down to 4 stars in my book)
Most (all?) of the sides, though delicious, are fried; though of course this is to be expected at most burger joints"}
{"text":"If you're in Madison go. Great burgers and fried cheese curds. Mozzarella burger is my favorite. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Dotty's is not fantastic, but it is certainly good, as well as quirky and charming enough to separate it from the 1,383 other burger joints within a mile of the U. of Wisconsin. 

Like every other place in Madison, Dotty's claims to have the best fried cheese curds in town. They may all be right, of course, because deep-fried cheese is hardly a delicacy that lends itself to easy shades of distinction. But these are a fine representation of the genre.

To my legion of fans who all know that I have weird, not-quite-vegetarian views on animal treatment, I must confess: I got a burger. It was not made of vegetables. I was assured that the cow grazed on pasture land, that her name was Sandra, and that she thanked them for her kind life and good death in her own inimitable cow idiom. Her heroic sacrifice brought me a damn good sandwich, as all of Dotty's are, and some guilt that I will now drown with PBR. It is not my fault: there is nothing else to eat here, as you may suspect by the average star rating of the non-burger places on this list as given by me or anyone else. State Street is a food desert if you refuse to eat cow.

But I digress: in two visits to Dotty's, I saw solid food, friendly service, old woody pub ethos, a great beer selection,1950's live action Disney movies on the TV, many happy locals, a few happy tourists, and enough vintage sci-fi kitsch on the walls and shelves to fill a very nerdy old lady's antique shop. And that's more than enough, in the end, to say that I'm a fan."}
{"text":"We went here for New Years Eve. Luckily it was one of the few places that were open for the Holiday. We were seated right away, which is always a plus. The waitress was checked on us occasionally, a good balance of not continuously and not leaving us helpless. We started off with drinks. They had a pretty good list of different beers and a decent wine list. For an appetizer, we had cheese curds with ranch. The best thing about these cheese curds, they aren't super greasy. Nothing turns a stomach like excess grease. We ordered our burgers, I got the Runnelstone (with other options in mind) and my boyfriend got the Cali burger. I'm trying to get more adventurous with food, but I like my burgers simple. So the Runnelstone has cheddar, grilled onions and their signature English garlic sauce (basically a garlic aioli). The Cali Burger has guac, bacon, provolone cheese and spouts. My boyfriend loved this one and commented how the sprouts really brought out all the other flavors. We were too full for dessert, but we hear the shakes are to die for. We will definitely be back for more burgers and curds."}
{"text":"This place is a must see in Madison. The service is awesome - bartenders are attentive, knowledgable and friendly. And the food is even better. Grilled cheese with fried pickles in it? One thousand times yes."}
{"text":"Dotty's was highly rated on yelp so we had to come try it out while we were in town.  The main goal of being here was just for the cheese curds, but it was a nice bonus that there was a good amount of local beers.  While looking at the menu, we weren't sure we'd be able to eat that many cheese curds so we opted for the SAMPLE BASKET and had a little bit of everything.  In addition to the food, I ordered a beer sampler, of course.  

The sample came with all fried items such as curds, mushrooms, onion rings, mac-n-cheese wedges, etc.  The plate was meant to be shared and it was a lot for two people especially when it was all fried.  Definitely tasty within the first few bites, a good plate to order if you can't decide what to eat from the apps menu.  

Dotty's is a very spot for some quick bites, some good beer, and enjoy a game or 2 on TV, even if the TVs are outdated (who doesn't have HD?!?)."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, yummy beer. With a smile the waiter/waitress catered to my no gluten demands. (Beer's gluten free. Right? :)) Ok I admit coming here two days in a row. I wanted to try vintage next door but couldn't get anyone to seat me or serve me."}
{"text":"Mediocre appetizers.Uninterested \"bartender\". She, Julia, gave me and my co-workers the cold shoulder for some reason. This was my first time in Madison and the reception of the natives was as cold as the weather. I thought the place was good because of the thirty minute wait and the rave reviews from the hotel clerk, but I was sadly disappointed."}
{"text":"Since serve Strongbow (on tap), I am morally obligated to love them.  The burgers are great, although the wait to get a table can be endless.  What can I say - shove your way in and grab a stool at the bar and have your dinner there.  Feel free to mix and match condiments to your heart's content.  And save your dill pickle for me.  
Addendum 1/25/06 - They've taken Strongbow off tap but still have it in \"man-cans\" - good enough for me!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice, were seated quickly. It's a bit dark and sometimes can get loud. 

I ordered the black bean burger and it was really good. Black bean burgers can be really hard to eat bun-and-all so I kind of picked mine apart a bit. 

We ordered cheese curds to start, and fries later. If you're like me and have a hard time picking between one or the other - just go with the curds. Both are way too much food, and you can definitely find average fries anywhere else. 

This place has some nice vegan/vegetarian options too."}
{"text":"Cool place with a great vibe. Right in the heart of downtown Madison. The truffle fries were nothing short of heaven in a potato. I had a burger that wasn't memorable but their drinks. \"Down in Mexico\" was great!  Must try if you decided to go to Mad-town"}
{"text":"Comfort burger place. I love it! 

No dumplings here, but there's a lot of AMAZING food I LoVE. 

Mac & Cheese wedges in cute tight triangles. Fried Portabella mushrooms. Shakes which you can split with a friend for a $1 fee. 

California burger (comes with guacamole). Lamb burger. Mushroom burger (not vegetarian, just has mushrooms AND garlic sauce!)

It's a fun place - dim lights, quirky decorations, black and white movies. 

Come here with friends for a fun night! I just wish there wasn't as many people who knew of this gem! You might be in for a wait on the weekends.."}
{"text":"I had only heard great things about this place. 

I had the melting pot burger and split cheese curds with my girlfriend. This is easily one of the best cheeseburgers I've ever had. The garlic sauce is a great touch. 

The restaurant is dark but very friendly.  Great spot, great good. Great beer selection.  Cannot so much better in Madison."}
{"text":"Another Madison favorite and one of the best burgers ever. They have an expansive menu of burgers, sandwiches, salads, side dishes and beers. High-quality beef too.  There are a couple of real stand-out features here.  First, the condiments they offer are the freshest of any place in recent or distant memory.  I remember the dill pickle chips as being big, tangy and super crisp.  Second, there's malt vinegar at all the tables, which you can use on anything, but its best liberally splashed all over the fries for an awesomely english flavor.  Great place."}
{"text":"The Green Bay burger was outstanding - it was the special for this week, so it came with fries and a drink. I also got the onion rings that were a perfect balance of crispy and tender (and I'm not a huge fan of the thick-cut onion rings).

Definitely love this place for burgers and the atmosphere. Great beer selection, too."}
{"text":"Dotty's exceeded my expectation. The flavors of the hamburgers are so thoughtful! We had the fried pickles! Oh my, I could eat them all day! 

I ended my meal with a milkshake! So tasty! I liked the atmosphere. The wait staff was so kind and anticipated everything! I would highly recommend Dotty's!!!"}
{"text":"A favorite for the near-decade I've lived in Madison. Appies are all top notch, and the burgers are just generally worth the hype. 

You'll have to wait for a table or seat if you go during peak hours (or around any nighttime events at Kohl Center) so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Try the melting pot burger! Fun college town burger place. We had a server who made great suggestions. If you are new to Wisconsin, make sure you order something with cheese!"}
{"text":"Love the space with the dark lighting & cozy booths. Great beer selection of domestic & non-domestic drafts/bottles. Service was fine if unmemorable. Now to the food:

Awesome cheesecurds. No breading, just a delicious crispy skin, oozy inside without a nasty pool of oil to make you feel bad about yourself. Fries were great too, not too oily or heavy either. Burger was just okay. Ordered the heartthrob (bacon, cheddar and their special spiced up cream cheese sauce). Cooked well (ordered medium, came just slightly medium rare) with decent texture (nice little char, grilled bun), but needed more than a moderate amount of additional seasoning. Their special sauce didn't even register, should've known better since cream cheese is so mild, but you learn.

Would nonetheless go back, based on their fried foods alone."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 10 times. Every time it seems the burgers get a wee bit smaller and more expensive..."}
{"text":"I checked out this establishment while in Madison due to the good reviews online.  I found it to be a juicy burger but very bland.  I really did not see what all the hype was about.  The service was slow even though there was hardly anybody there.  The cheese curds and fried pickles were good."}
{"text":"Outstanding home made soups. Make your own burger with various condiments and vegetables-- best in Madison. Gets very crowded when there is a sporting event at the Kohl Center and on football weekends."}
{"text":"I came here with my family a few months ago and was actually pleasantly surprised. I don't normally like burgers but the one I got here was good! If you're looking for a good place to head after a game (in which case, good luck getting in here!), I would recommend this spot because of the atmosphere. Yet, if you're just looking to get something to eat or showing your friends/family around Madison, I would choose a different restaurant. While it was good, I wasn't blown away like I have been at other places here."}
{"text":"\"We're going here? Again?!?\"

Yeah, that's my typical line in response to the group I'm with that overrules me and decides to go here for the zillionth, trillonth time.   Maybe I'd give it 4 stars, but I got so bored with returning again and again to this place.  

Their melting pot burger is highly recommended. 3 cheeses and mushrooms. Yes! And there are triangles of  goodness with the fried mac and cheese. The restaurant knows how to use cheese to prepare food in its favor. 

But here's a typical experience: we wait, wait, wait for a table, I'm starving, and I get pissy. And the cold air from outside blasts me whenever another crowd comes in.  

Then the server comes to take my order and I am salivating. They are completely out of the Buffalo burger! Damn it!  Oh okay, I try to be pacified by the wilted fries that just got placed in front of me. 

Also, why do they have a Harvard flag hanging up with its eclectic, junky decor? This is Badger country, people! The only red and white that should show up is University of Wisconsin-Madison's!

Also, if they are going to be playing old, classic, or just plain quirky films, and not put the sound on, why not put up closed captioning?!? So when patrons look up, they have something to read while waiting and waiting and waiting for their food? 

Then Dotties has t-shirts available, but who is going to be interested in wearing them with fat babies with bibs plastered on them? Jeez! They have to potential to make them so much better, and then get free advertising from college students running around wearing them."}
{"text":"Second time I've been here and each time has been equally delicious. I see some reviews indicating poor service, but ours was great! 

Burgers are phenomenal. You can tell the beef is really great quality and that the cooks know what they are doing. Fries are great too, make sure to get the English Garlic sauce to dip them in. I indulged in a chocolate milkshake as well, which was perfectly thick and chocolately. The atmosphere is also very cozy and inviting.

I had their new Bayou Burger. Only complaint would be that it was quite hard to get the cajun flavor described on the menu through the burger. I couldn't find the \"Louisiana Hot Sauce\" anywhere on my burger. However the Cajun Mayo was very good, and I appreciate that it came on the side so you could decide how much or how little you wanted. Also, they should really invest in some gluten-free buns! Being gluten-free, I would definitely gravitate towards the Nitty Gritty or DLUX instead of Dotty's, simply for the gluten-free buns those places offer.

Overall, a great place to grab a bite!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, adorable menu, cute place. Don't even try to go there when there is an event at the Kohl Center though. It will not work."}
{"text":"I was in town for dinner and wanted a good burger, this place came highly recommended on Yelp. I ordered their cheese curds and yes they are fantastic yet for four people you probably want two orders I mean we got less than 15 total cheese curds and they come in a giant basket.  I ordered the burger their menu said was the best seller it had their homemade garlic sauce which was delicious and the burger was cooked perfectly. I also had fries and those there were a ton of which was a nice change. The service was fantastic my drink was never empty which I always appreciate. Overall it was a good place to get a burger with great prices."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go before a Badgers hoops game! Great beer selection and some of the best burgers I have had in my life! There are about 15 types of burgers on the menu so plenty to choose from. Also, very good service. We got seated at about 11:15 before a noon game and we were able to get our food, drinks and bill in time to make the start of the game."}
{"text":"I was seated in a corner booth facing all together four booths, filled with college students in happy conversations around their tumblers of soda. This was a neat place, a bit dark in a moody kind of way, but nice in the way that you can still see your food an your companions kind of way.
The service was great, a friendly waitress with a flower in her hair, big gleaming eyes and a biggest smile I have ever seen of someone recommending a local beer. She got me Hopalicious and it was delicious. An of course for the burger, I went for their famous The Melting Pot, and it was glorious. The best burger I have ever had. Really. 
I just wish that I have known of this place three days earlier. Well, next time in Madison.."}
{"text":"There's no better place in Madison for perfectly-done, sloppy hamburgers. The sheer variety of toppings is amazing (guacamole, English garlic sauce, etc., but no fried egg??). Atmosphere is distinctive, noisy (in a good way), super casual. I love the fact that although it's a \"sporty\" venue, being so close to the Kohl Center, they play Turner Classic Movies on the TVs! Tip: if dining with at least one other, it's cheaper to split the deluxe fries. Oh, and you have to have mayo on the side (for true \"Euro-fries\", pour the mayo over the fries)."}
{"text":"The first thing about this place - it's dark. I always walk by thinking it's closed. Second thing - the burgers don't come automatically with sides, so you need to remember to order fries or cheese curds or whatever.

I love the fried mushrooms. Cheese curds are quite good too. The rest of the sides are just so-so - I do not recommend the sampler.

I do like the burgers - and the fun names make it even better. The first time I came, I just got a normal cheeseburger - not exciting. Second time, I got the basil mozzarella - delicious and my favorite. The Melting Pot is also sooo good, but a little too heavy for me most of the time.

Service: always friendly, good with recommendations
Environment: typical bar/restaurant, usually sports on TV, booth seats. It's got a cozy feel that I like though."}
{"text":"I am going here tomorrow and I can't wait! Dotty's has the best cheese curds in Madison. Just thinking about them is making my mouth water.  

I love that you can get Buffalo or Ostritch burgers here, and there are numerous choices for toppings.

The wait before a hockey game can be redic, but if you get there early enough its not too big of a deal, but it will still be crowded as hell and inevitably you will have someone standing over you waiting for a table. On game days they aren't very good at estimating the wait, so beware, 30 minutes could possibly really be an hour and a half. If you have the time, the food is so worth it."}
{"text":"I actually give it 3.5 stars! We got two burgers: the California and the Stanley. I felt like the Stanley was delicious but way too much bbq sauce. However the California didn't have enough toppings. There was only a thin layer of guac and barely any sprouts. The cheese curds were delicious though! Yum!

Warning: fries are NOT included in your burger decision."}
{"text":"Great burgers, good service but a little pricy if you want any side other than french fries.  In other words you can not upgrade to sweet potato fries they make you order both which is kind of ridiculous.  So you end up with a burger, regular fries and sweet potato fries with a soft drink is about $20.  But zero complaints about the way the food tastes."}
{"text":"DOTTY'S DUMPLING DOWRY...YASSSS!!!!!

Okay, let me air my two minor grievances immediately as others have also stated:  Service can be dodgey on weekend nights and Badger game days/evenings. You're asking for it if you show up during these times. But it IS worth it!!! Also, you have to order burgers and fries separately. UGGHH!!

I have enjoyed casual drinks, a few Das Boots, cups of chili, so many burgers, and so many mac n' cheese bites  and sampler appetizer baskets over the years...it's ridiculous. 

If you can get over the wait time, Dotty's is just a fun atmosphere all around. Amazing bar/Americana food done well. I have nothing else to add or take away. It's DELICIOUS.

It's not an issue for me, but Dotty's staff does not split bills either. You have to itemize your receipts yourself or pony up and combine cash/cards. When I've dine in groups, thankfully there has been an ambitious math-whiz present to take care of this issue...I just ain't got time for that!

I'm having issues finishing this review now...I want to devour a few burgers, fries, and appetizers. Gosh, I'll have to pay another visit soon!"}
{"text":"Oh Dotty Dumpling's Dowry...how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways:

1.  Best burger ever.  Seriously.  I take back all the other times that I have thrown this out there and give you the crown.  The burger was perfectly cooked, the bacon was crispy and delicious, the Heart Throb sauce is divine, and the bleu cheese was perfect.
2.  BEAUTIFUL craft beer list.  There are plenty of awesome local brews on tap (I opted for some Ale Asylum beers), the list is organized by brewery (and state, OG reading, and IBUs are listed...swoon!), and there are also imports and domestics for the *other* drinkers as well.
3.  Fried Cheese Curds + English Garlic Sauce = HEAVEN.
4.  The actual restaurant is small and homey and inviting.  I love the speakeasy feel of the outside, the dark wood, the motorcycle paraphernalia, the old timey songs and music...But really? You had me at vintage betches with brews in the bathroom.

I don't think I can ever eat anywhere else in Madison ever again.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town! Nice low lighting atmosphere, atleast at night. Can't wait to go back again and again!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and was visiting family in Wisconsin.  There were ten of us on two tables.  To start, there was a basketball tournament in the area, so there was no place to park that was close.  My mom uses a walker... No worries, the owner found a space for us.  Before we were seated I looked around at thought that this was a place I would have chosen.. Nice little bar, comfortable seating, crooners in the  background. Sage, the server was absolute phenomenal.. All the orders and special orders all gotten right .  The entire staff was fun, friendly and professional... I tried the two of the  different specialty sauces. one was a garlic Aoli... and the other was jalepeno cilantro, garlic, maybe sour cream... yummy.... my burger was awesome! very happy... this is a must return when I'm in town"}
{"text":"I am usually not a big burger eater, but after checking out the menu online I was excited to go. I went with a group of girls I went to college with for our bi-annual reunions. The resturant is rather dark and the girl working at the hostess station looked like she would rather been walking over glass shards.... We were seated pretty quickly even though the resturant was busy. We ordered the combo basket which was great. The cheese curds and mushrooms are awesome. I ordered the Gladiator for my main meal. It was really really good. It has a thick slice of melted munster cheese, red onion, and an awesome sauce (the name escapes me). The sauce was a combo of mustard and mayo with black pepper corn and anchovie. Fantasic. I would go back again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"When you walk in, it's immediately dark.  It doesn't feel like a burger joint, it feels like a burger restaurant.  Nice booths and friendly but slow service.

I got pretty excited while looking at the menu.  There were so many options.  I opted for the Melting Pot burger with the patty done medium.  When the burger came out, it looked good - nicely stacked.  But the first bite into it it was cold, room temperature at best.  The patty was mostly rare and not how a medium burger should be cooked.  The flavors of the cheeses and bacon was good, but the meat patty itself was seriously lacking - I could hardly taste it at all.  

Pretty sorry burger, if you ask me.   I'm hoping my burger was just sitting out cold while they were making the fries, which I ordered chili cheese style.  They tasted good and were hot and piping.  Yum!

Burger was wack.  My friend and I said we could have gotten better burgers at Five Guys (go there instead!).  

There's no excuse for a cold burger."}
{"text":"A visit to Madison is not complete without a stop here!  The cozy atmosphere and down to earth, delicious food keeps me and my hubs coming back."}
{"text":"All I can say is the food sucks. I visited two other burger places recently in Madison based on recommendations and they were great!!! Dotty's was terrible. I honestly have no idea how the hell this place got a good review. A coworker of mine who went to Wisconsin, also thought the food was ok, while another (who I now question his taste and intelligence) thought the burgers were good. All I can say, is that the other burger places I went to, were much, much better. I don't give harsh reviews unless the place deserves it. Well Dotty's is just no good. 


Well, I visited Dotty's for the second time because the cooks at Dotty's promised they didn't wipe their asses with their hands before they made my burgers. Unfortunately, they lied. I got sick again. Screw you Dotty's. Your sucks balls and made me sick. Twice. I'm a tax attorney & was a former assistant DA in Milwaukee. I want to sue you clowns in small claims so bad right now. Shut done & go out of business. Jerks!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had great hope for this place based on reviews but was greatly disappointed. 

First problem was the beer. You do NOT serve quality micro-brews ice cold and in a frosty mug. With such a nice beer list, I figured they would know that but apparently not. It's great for the cheap mega-brews, but don't do that to my IPA. I was also quite surprised when my pint was $8!

The second problem was the burger. They had great potential but both burgers were nearly raw. I normally order my burgers medium, but these were rare."}
{"text":"I'm in heaven. A REAL burger, not tofu not vegan no gf bun but a REAL burger. I Ordered the Melting Pot with REAL CHEESE and REAL BACON. Lots of craft beers I washed mine down with a PBR baby!!!!!  I didnt order fries so I cant give a review on those. So if your looking for a non vegan burger on real bread this is the place to be!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers not the best ive ever had but 4stars is pretty legit!"}
{"text":"Such a cute name for a burger place! 

I'm not a native of Madison but this place screams \"Madison\" to me. It has a nice sized bar with lots of cozy booths for large groups of college students. I came here on  Friday night and it was pretty busy at the time but they were able to seat me and my boyfriend with no wait. Beer was amazing, but then again when is it not amazing in Madison? I had the lamb burger and it was topped off with a creamy feta cheese. My boyfriend had the buffalo burger. We split a large order of fries and shared a chocolate pie for dessert. All in all a great meal, except we were hungry an hour later. I'm not sure if that has to do with the food or the fact that me and my boyfriend are fatties.....it's probably the latter."}
{"text":"My burger, a vibrant blend of turkey, sage, and rosemary adorned by cranberry mustard and swiss, nestled within the boundaries of soft and sweet bun you need in a burger: transcendental. The cheese curds my fellow diners shared was all I had hoped for add a New Englander visiting beautiful Madison. The tap list... Wisconsin has some memorable and generally solid brews. Dotty's seems to be the sort of institution that locals can enjoy with visitors beside them. The wait staff is understanding and helpful. In the end it's the kind of place that you don't find often in a world of chains-dedicated to an experience and not a fad. A great meal and a must in Madison, namely if a burger is your immediate need."}
{"text":"Dotty Dumpling's Dowry supposedly has the best burger in Madison. I say it depends on what kind of burger you're in the mood for. The burger at Dotty's is maybe a half an inch thick, and drips with grease. I've had the bread completely fall apart under the weight of the patty. They're always cooked exactly right, but I suggest you get it a little more charred than normal if you don't want to get sick. It's just too much if your stomach isn't properly trained for it.

Now if you're looking for something that is thick and juicy, it is a pretty excellent burger. They have all sorts of varieties and special sauces that you can throw on the burger as well, but the standard cheese-lettuce-tomato-onion combination is probably the best one. The crazy sauces tend to get drowned out by the bloody meat sauce oozing out of the patty.

There's also a great beer selection to compliment your burger; the bar in here is way underrated. Amazing place to come just for a low-key drink.

One time, for a change of pace, I tried the jerk chicken sandwich. Terrible idea, it was completely dry and tasteless. Stick to ordering what Dotty's is good at - big burgers and fried comfort food."}
{"text":"Good food - Madison redefines bar food with such places. 

Beer, Chicken wings, milk shake. Life is good :)

A great plus that it is sooo close to campus and downtown - get both the student as well as the adult crowd. Always full, but that's a sign of a good place and what is the bar for??"}
{"text":"Where do I start? Their burger ( no surprise since they're known for their burgers) was absolutely insane good and their fries tasted like they were maybe cut fresh. My friend got the buffalo chicken sandwich which was also amazing! I've been craving the burger since I left I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were only in Madison for one night and wanted to get a good dinner while we were there. We jumped on yelp and found Dotty's was nearby and had great reviews so we ventured over. 
We got there probably around 730pm on a Wednesday night. It wasn't too busy and we were seated right away. Our server (who's name I forgot) came over right away to get our drink order. 
The menu isn't huge, but everything looked amazing. Especially the burgers, which is their specialty. We ordered a side of poutine, I had the Melting Pot, and my husband ordered the Gladiator. The poutine was amazing! Delicious gravy and a few fried cheese curds on top. SO GOOD. Big portion, too. The burgers are not HUGE... but they are good size. They both were AMAZING. The sauces were to die for! Especially the English Garlic. Just so good! 
The have a decent beer selection, too with local beers.. which we wanted to try. Our waiter was really good about helping with a beer recommendation, too. 
We are really happy we chose Dotty's as our one meal in Madison. It was awesome and I'd definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Hands down best spot for dinner or a date in Madison. The melting pot is the best hamburger in the whole world. And the macaroni and cheese wedges are the best appetizer in the whole universe."}
{"text":"Great place for a local burger thats juicy and done right. The fried wisconsin cheese curds are addicitvely good and gooey, perfect as a splurge to split with someone. Pretty affordable too"}
{"text":"Very, very solid, cheap enough to go over and over, and the fries and cheesecurds are great.
Good to have a chat and hang out for a good half-hour."}
{"text":"A fantastic burger with a great selection. Pulled into Madison after a long day of driving and grabbed a burger here. It hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Interesting design throughout. Food is very good, very messy, and certainly worth eating.

There's a Pokéstop right inside to keep geeks (like me) and kids entertained. Had the curds, the fries, and the vanilla shake alongside my Southwest burger. Be wary of the mustard dipping sauce, it's got kick.

Overall I'd recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Best burgers in America. For real. Plus, amazingly fresh curds, and solid local beer selection."}
{"text":"The food we ate was absolutely wonderful.  The server was very understanding that it was our first time there so she helped with suggestions and answered questions so we could order just enough food."}
{"text":"When we knew were going to be in town for a while I did some Yelp-Search to find a place to eat for lunch. Being particularly fond of the hamburger, we found a couple of locations that really looked good. In the interest of full disclosure the first place we went to was closed for renovations. I had actually planned on getting a burger at both places so we were going to go to Dotty's anyhow.
Dotty's was busy when we arrived and we have about a 20mn wait. Not bad at all and usually a good sign when a place is busy. We had already done our homework and knew what we wanted to order. I ordered the Pub burger with fries, my wife wanted to save herself for a special dinner and only went with the fried pickles. 
Our order arrived pretty quickly. I hit my burger right away. While my burger was cooked perfectly, the cheese was not melted. Munster cheese is usually a pretty good cheese to use for melting and this was not melted. My burger was supposed to have bacon and I don't recall seeing any bacon. Maybe it was cut up, just didn't stand out. While my burger was good, I felt it was missing some of the fat and goodness that I crave with a burger. The fries were good and I took every opportunity to dip them in what tasted like homemade ranch dipping sauce that came with my wife's fried pickles. The fried pickles by the way were very good. The pickles tasted homemade. They were crispy and the ranch dipping sauce was a perfect compliment. Dotty's has a lot of burgers and I would totally be up for trying some of their other burgers. Dotty's is an old school place and had I gone to school in Madison, I'd be there a few nights a week and on the weekends for a burger and a beer."}
{"text":"My goodness if Mary had a little lamb this place caught it and served it with onion rings ! The lamb burger was phenomenal!  Now the service is a flavor all it own and speaking of flavor my server saige is amazing she knows how to feed me and cayla is right there next to her too I eat these burgers daily and I work at a restaurant.  I love love love Dottys I'm on my way now"}
{"text":"This is an iconic place for anyone from the area or if you went to school at UW Madison.  I hadn't been for about 20 years. The location has changed but the food...ohhhh the food. The burgers were ammmaazzziinng everything was but the burgers stood out. I consider myself to be somewhat of a burger connoisseur and this place definitely makes my top five list. 

We shared the fried mushrooms which were good, not the best I've ever had but definitely up there. We had the green and gold burger,  the melting pot burger, and a bison burger with just tomatoes and lettuce. We shared a basket of fries. Out of all the burgers the bison and melting pot were the top picks.

The service was 4.5 stars all the way. She seemed really busy and there were times when the wait was a bit long feeling but what lacked in promotness was made up for with her kindness and she just seemed to really like/enjoy her job."}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to stop here for lunch after having been meaning to do so for years. The burgers have a great reputation, and I wanted to check them out myself.

On arrival, the hostess had us seated in a few short minutes, and she, like all the employees we encountered, was very warm and friendly. The decor is jam-packed with whimsical items to keep your eyes from focusing on any one thing. I doubt you'd have a productive working lunch here if your attention span is anything like mine.

I ordered the Heart Throb burger, which had a touch of heat to it. The fries were hot and satisfying. The default cook on burgers is medium, which is a welcome change from the norm. Other orders at my table included a build-a-burger, which turned out great.

The burger variety, interesting decor, and friendly staff make for a winning combination here. Check it out."}
{"text":"YUMMMMMMY!! I thoughly enjoyed my burger. Our whole group did.
We also shared a sampler basket of all things fried. All thing delicious! Cheese curds, mac and cheese, onion rings, fries and mushrooms. It's more like heart attack basket but hey, all things in moderation, right?

GREAT ATMOSPHERE! I loved the old vintage charm of Dotty Dumplings!

If and I mean IF I had to make a complaint, I'd say server was a tiny but aloof, not enough to annoy me, but she could have check on us more. NOT a big deal really.

I don't live in Madison but do visit once or twice a year and you bet I'll return!!
 I love Dotty's!"}
{"text":"I've had numerous burgers in my life from many locations across the world. The Melting Pot was one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life! Big statement right? 

I asked the sweet rental car lady where to go for a unique Madison meal...she came up with Cracker Barrel...ok, my fault, she was a waif, how would she know? So we went down to the little drag by UW and did a little tooling around. We went into a shop where we presented the same question, the kid behind the counter lit up and announced we needed to go to Dotty's. The other two associates chimed in with OMG, we have to get the Melting Pot. So we tried to keep as much of the directions in our heads as possible and were on our way. Couldn't find it..I said, ok, we need to ask someone that looked like they knew where good eats were. I picked a robust student with books and backpack if they knew where Dotty's burger place was. The sweet look of hardening arteries washed over the face and straightened me out. 

The place is indeed dark, the service is indeed slow. But the best burger and apps basket I've ever had. All the cheese curds, mac and cheese, mushrooms, etc. It was delicious. I enjoyed it soooo much that I decided to get a pint glass as a souvenir. The waitress charged me $5...and handed me a glass that had been well. I asked her if they had any new ones. She could not comprehend what \"new\" meant. I had to explain that for $5, I wanted a glass in a box, or at least without scratches and lipstick on it. So she did the next best thing. Washed it and put it in a brown paper bag. All I can say is, gotta love that midwestern charm."}
{"text":"I love the burgers at the DDD. I've been going to Madison for two weeks at a time for work. By far the best burgers I've come across and they're cooked to order. If you want a lighter lunch try the jambalaya and a side salad. Their cheese curds are delicious. They come with house made ranch and honey mustard for dipping. The employees have been cool about splitting up our group's tickets and also about splitting adult beverages onto additional tickets for those of us that can't put the drinks on corporate cards. If you're in Madison it's one of the places you must stop."}
{"text":"Dotty's burgers are great!. I like the build your own and this time I opted for a veggie patty. Lot's of cheese and topping options. The spicy veggie patty was pretty tasty. Made with black beans and it didn't crumble like veggie patties often do. My meat eating friends enjoyed their beef burgers. We also shared the fried mushrooms which were globs of crunchy goodness. Needless to say, my trip to Dotty's is not going into my fitness app! Good bar with a lots of beers with a good selection of local/Midwestern beers on tap. Half price pints at happy hour. Bartender was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable on the beer offerings."}
{"text":"Visited Madison WI for the New Year's holiday weekend and Dotty Dumpling's was on the list of top things to do within this very cool city.  Needless to say, my family and I were certainly glad that it was... this place is amazing!

The atmosphere of the restaurant is cool; very college town feel to it.  We have a booth with a great view of the TVs to watch some college football.  Our hostess was super prompt and attentive. 

We ordered the cheese curds (its Wisconsin baby!) and each of us ordered one of their fabulous burgers.  No joke - these burgers are super fresh and grilled as if you were in someone's backyard on a summer's day.  We loved them!  

Washing down these tasty burgers with a flight of local beers made Dotty a must stop for me anytime I come back to Madison."}
{"text":"So why did we go into a burger place and not eat a burger? I think it has a lot to do with the fact that we \"visited\" a cow farm a couple of hours earlier where the babies were all kept in complete darkness and the dead adults were just thrown out on the road for their friends to look at. The smell was seriously something I've never dealt with before and, as much as I wanted to eat the hell out of 99% of their burger menu, I couldn't do it.

The fish fry and sampler basket of fried stuff were both good (especially the mushrooms.) I'm pretty sure they use a 50 pound fish for that fry. I really liked the salad I had with cranberries, walnuts and tuna, too.

I still don't understand why it wasn't possible to split up a check. It's not like we rolled in there with 15 people and needed 25 different checks. Four people and 2 checks seems like a pretty basic thing for a restaurant to do. Eh, whatever."}
{"text":"This place is too small for so many chairs...The atmosphere is that of a bar, and they serve bar food(fried) along with baked fish and etc...

Our experience was pleasant, the waitress was great, the food was tasty and arrived in a timely manner, it was hot. 

Everything is a la carte. So that means there is no deal for combo( sandwich and fries with drink). That also means they can charge high prices for each item, which they do. The service and atmosphere isn't electrifying enough for the prices of food."}
{"text":"Excellent vegeterian and vegan burgers with a good selection of sides!"}
{"text":"Ordered wings as appetizer flavor was great and so was the value. Blue cheese had huge chunks super yum! Heartthrob burger I was expecting to have more of a punch of flavor. Fries were super crispy and fresh. Service was good! I would def recommend! I took off one star bc of the burger"}
{"text":"Five stars for ambience alone! Food, service, beer selection all worth five stars as well... Just so rare to find a place that really nails it on sound and creature comfort. Place was packed, but bar was still perfectly intimate setting thanks to great lighting, well thought out sound absorption, mindful staff & quiet evening music. Just perfect."}
{"text":"For the best burger place in Madison, I award it to Dotty Dumpling's.

In fact, they specialize in burgers and have a huge selection of them on their menu. Even if, in the extremely rare occasion, you blasphemously don't want one of Dotty Dumpling's original or alternative burgers, there is always the option to build your own. 

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend my favorite burger here; it's because I tried most of them and was not disappointed each time I went. If you're in the mood for a heart attack, however, I'd go for the Melting Pot burger. Sometimes I get the Aphrodite burger in an attempt to falsely trick myself into thinking it is a healthier option. 

Regardless, if you want a quality burger, head over to Dotty Dumpling's."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries with gourmet fixings.  Go early on a weekend.  It was quite full by 5:30 on a Saturday,"}
{"text":"The cheese curds here were delicious, definitely the best I have had in Madison! The burger, on the other hand, was so-so. I got the Runnelstone, which had english garlic sauce and grilled onions. The burger was juicy and good, but the bun was bad. It was so floppy and soggy that I wish I had used a fork and knife. Get some pretzel buns Dotty! Then I'd bump you up to a 5."}
{"text":"Great burger. I had a spicy number with their signature jalapeño-cilantro cream cheese. Good fries. Environment was good for a biz lunch, family, or friend outing. Tall wood booths. Comfortable lighting. TVs, but not a sports bar. $20 for two sandwiches, shared order of fries, and a soda. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Soggy bun killed the burger for me. Meat was actually quite good. Also like the cheese curds and the fries. Grilled onions not so great on the burger."}
{"text":"Dotty Dumpling's Dowry is a great place but you can't see that from the outside. Best thing to do is just go in, I assure you, Dotty's is charming. Wood booths, smaller but not boutique, cool decor, Marilyn Monroe movies playing with the sound turned down so you can hear the jazz music. And I am not into jazz but it suits this place so well.

We got a table right away. Service was good. Our server knew what was good on the food and beer menus and made a couple great recommendations. The food is mostly casual and that was alright by us. We started with an appetizer sampler basket which has fried cheese curds, fries and more along with dipping sauce. For dinner we had burgers. All were cooked as we had ordered them; medium, rare and medium rare.

Prices reasonable and we scored street parking."}
{"text":"If you wanted something that was healthy, you wouldn't be here. This may be the best burger in Madison, but even if it isn't, it's firmly among the first class. Eat local!"}
{"text":"Great bar food. The curds are yummy and burger was pretty good. Nothing mind blowing but totally worth visiting while in town!"}
{"text":"This is THE BEST hamburger I have EVER EVER EVER eaten in my life. The service was excellent, and the food...whilst presentation lacking, had the most rich flavor I have ever experienced in my life."}
{"text":"I had the lamb burger on special for lunch. Fantastic flavor!  Like that they keep malt vinegar on table. The green and gold burger was un-spectacular. We got seated right away because it was right when they opened. We stay frequently at fluno right across street and we always see a line out the door. Dark wooded decor. Fun memorabilia. Mac n cheese bites were the same as at Vintage except that Vintage has slightly better ranch."}
{"text":"As someone who is not necessarily crazy about burgers, I have to say I really enjoyed Dotty's. I also have several strange food allergies and am usually limited in what I can select from the menu. I was able to try something unique at Dotty's without fear of ending up in the hospital.

The burger I tried was delicious - definitely not a reheated frozen patty. The service was friendly and the appetizers and sides were just as good as the burgers. We get fried cheese curds wherever we go, and Dotty's are up there with the best."}
{"text":"It's awesome! Best part you can switch all burgers with chicken and/or vegetarian patties! Try the pesto mozzarella burger. Fresh and tasty"}
{"text":"In town yesterday for a job interview and we stopped in here on a suggestion from a friend and we are already planning a trip back! 

The atmosphere is fantastic, dimmed with pin up-esqe art and black and white films on the televisions(I'm sure this may change through the week, but this was early Monday afternoon). The namesake coming from a Sir Arthur Conan O'Doyle reference was a winner with me as well.

We were sat right away and our waitress came promptly for drinks. I wish I would've got her name, she was extremely pleasant, seemed to really enjoy her job, not pushy in the slightest and had fantastic sleeve tattoos.

Our food came quickly and was absolutely magnificent! 

Ordered: Heart throb and fries, the heart throb sauce is a jalapeno sauce so I was unable to try it to vouch(I would've been in tears!) But I was assured it was perfect.

I had the alumni and fries. The custom steak sauce was delicious and the burger itself was cooked to perfection! 

We wolfed our meals in less than 20 minutes and were pleasantly stuffed! 

The bill was not as painful as I feared for everything being ala carte, around $23 for two full meals(no booze this time). 

All in all, this was a very pleasant experience with the best burger I have ever had and I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"The burgers were decent, but they weren't worth the cost with how tiny they were.  I can think of a number of burger joints in Madison that are much better."}
{"text":"Good jambalaya and ok chili (the cheese is a slice just plopped on top) and cornbread... Great beer... But that's all I could eat. I have a severe fish allergy and it was that or a few of their salads (nothing with any meat though). Very disappointing that they hadn't thought about cross contamination with allergies. I'll go back for the soup and definitely the beer but it'll only be with friends... Not by myself. And only if other people suggest it. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Great burgers that you can customize! Seasoned and cooked the right way. Our server Tom was great and made us out of towners feel special . We would have went back twice but didn't have enough time. Bummer! You can't go wrong here,no way no how!"}
{"text":"Cheese Curds- 2 out of 5 curds
Tiny, bite-size cheese curds, pretty adorable in size. Nothing too special in terms of fried cheese curds, just average. Pile of good poppin fun to eat. 

Sweet Potato Fries- 4 out of 5 curds
Delicious! Not sure if it's because they are made from sweet potatoes or what, but these tasted far less greasy and guilty to eat than regular fries. Very skinny shoestring fries that don't make you feel fat eating them. 

Mac 'n Cheese Wedges- 5 out of 5 curds
Mmmmmm. This was the first place I had ever encountered this native Sconnie delicacy. I wasn't really sure what to expect when I bit into the light-colored wedge, but an explosion of warm, cheesy Mac n cheese filled my orifice. Would definitely do this again. 

Southwest burger (w/ bleu cheese & tomato) - 2 out of 5 curds
For claiming to be the best burgers in town I'd have to disagree. The Southwest burger is a medium rare beef patty topped with cheddar cheese, bacon, and a special BBQ sauce. I substituted for the pungent yet addictive bleu cheese. And added tomato. The burger presentation was poor, a bit sloppy and disappointing to the eyes. The buns look and taste pretty cheap and low quality. The burger was built in such a sloppy manner any chance at a civilized biting approach was shot. Bacon was good. Cheese was good. The tomato slice provided a nice fresh contrast. So we're the pickle slices that almost fooled our table into being cucumbers just by there appearance. Regardless of the presentation I inhaled the burger after the hour long wait to sit and another hour wait for food. 

Since the star of this review should have been the burger since Dotty's claims to have the best in town I was pretty disappointed. Would not return for a burger, but might for the Mac n cheese wedges if I can't find them somewhere else around town. 

Giant pickle is cool."}
{"text":"Big hype about this place, I suppose it's okay. Build your own burger spot. The burger that I asked to be medium was quite rare. Just felt like they were trying to rush us out of there. In fact, you can't stay longer than an hour per their policy. Dark and crowded with kitschy Wisconsin decor, it's better than your average pub."}
{"text":"YUM
YUM
YUM
Is there more to say? BEST place for a beer and burgers!! Brought friend who is a chef and he says HANDS DOWN the BEST burger he's ever had.  ALWAYS worth the mula and wait.  THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"Best burger in the state! They are also able to accommodate my son's peanut and tree nut allergies."}
{"text":"Sweet find, great brew selection, and loved my buffalo burger. Staff was friendly and the bar area comfortable. Couple cuties working their, one with a particular sweet smile, always a plus. This place deserves a place on State St."}
{"text":"Need something hearty after a day of perusing through Downtown Madison, or a late night bite after indulging into one too many adult beverages?  You've found the right place.  Dotty Dumpling's Dowry is an old fashioned bar/restaurant that provides just good ol' American, stick to the bones, comfort food.  

I ordered the special of the nice which was a truffle burger, and it did not disappoint.  The burger itself was cooked a perfect medium.  It was juicy, buttery, and unbelievably savory.  The condiments were also done well.  The truffle was not over done and it enhance the flavor of the beef.  

As for the sides, we ordered fried pickles, cheese curds, and chili cheese fries.  The fried pickles and cheese curds were what you would expect.  They were fried, battered, and delicious, but nothing out of the norm.  The chili fries though was far from the norm because it was coated with Dotty's famous chili.  The chili was hearty, full of spice, and had actual pieces of beef tips and pork tenderloin.  Using that chili with quality sharp cheddar on a bed of crispy fries was a perfect marriage.  

Dotty's is classic Americana, and if you are looking quality food and a welcoming atmosphere, you've found the right place."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my wife and son. We all got different chicken sandwiches. All had buns that fell apart and got very soggy, and nobody likes wet bread. On the bright side, we all liked the flavor. The truffle fries were a disappointment, though, because they were very stingy with the truffle aioli. Prices were a little steep for what you get. Service was good."}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Food came out piping hot. Yummy burger. I would definitely come back here for another burger!!"}
{"text":"I was let down by a lot of Hamburger America's suggestions, but this one might have been the best.  The burgers are grilled and delicious.  They also have fried cheese curds which are awesome and a good beer selection."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and came here based on the other Yelp reviews.  
Atmosphere - great!  We really enjoyed the decor and the obvious \"college town\" vibe.  
Food - awesome.  The burgers, the buns, fries, salads, cheese curds were perfect
Drinks - great beer selection with local brews
Service - was a problem.  I specifically told the server we wanted to take our time.  I asked for space between appetizer, salad, and entree so we could enjoy or beer and conversation.  Salads came out minutes after the appetizer and burgers within seconds of the salads.we were made to feel incredibly rushed. 

If I lived around here, I would definitely return for the great food and atmosphere.   I would just make sure to order one course at a time."}
{"text":"So my co worker and I were on a business trip and were staying downtown Madison. I got a really bad craving for Burgers, Cheese Curds, and Beer! 

Looked up a few places around the hotel and found this gem!

We came in and grabbed a seat at the bar and immediately ordered the spotted cow and some fried cheese curds. Both were amazing and I highly recommend them to anyone visiting the DDD. We then ordered the spinach salad and two burgers: The Pub Burger and the Classic Burger. We ended up splitting both burgers but after eating half of the Pub Burger, I regretted splitting it because IT WAS AMAZING! Honestly, the best burger I've ever had. It had an onion jam which was so delicious. Oh and the cheese sauce basically made the burger. I can't say enough about it! The staff were great, super helpful and so sweet! Can't wait to come back for
another work trip!"}
{"text":"Dotty's is the classic burger in Madison. I've been eating here for 25 years and the food continues to be solid. From the stadium, to the capital to its current location, I am just a little happier when I walk inside.  Great atmosphere, great location, great food. I do miss the Banana Creme Pie. Try a burger and shake; then have a beer, You'll feel like a new man. This is a must visit."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite burger places in town.  Usually it can be very crowded so plan accordingly.  I've tried many different burgers and they have all been great.  So far my only complaint is that sometimes when the burger makes it out the bun is already soggy.  The fries are great and a large size is a great sharing portion.  Don't forget about the milkshakes, which they will also split for you as well if asked."}
{"text":"I'm all about Dotty's.

The interior is nice and dark and full of random things on the walls, and seating is pretty secluded.

Love the menu, there are a lot of options, but I traditionally go for the Melting Pot Burger, which is pretty freaking amazing.

They have a lot of great choices for dipping sauces for fries and cheese curds.

It is a pretty popular place, and is located right by the Kohl's Center, so if you aren't careful about when you go, you might not get a table."}
{"text":"Not as good as the old Dotty's. You know the one. The one they had to tear down. Maybe it wasn't that good and I'm just being nostalgic, but the new one just feels more like an Applebee's. Although their cheese curds are slammin'."}
{"text":"Used to be great, now just okay. The burgers are the best in Madison conceptually but are not consistently prepared the best. Unique interior styling has given way to bring a poorly lit TGI Friday's. Malts are still great. More of a great nostalgia trip than a great restaurant at this point."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices and outstanding service. Out server Becka was very friendly and cheerful. The food came out very quickly. I had a chicken Cesar salad. My daughter had the fish fry and both were excellent"}
{"text":"Really disappointing takeout experience. I was quoted 15 minutes and it took 30. When my bag was given to me, I double checked and was missing an item. I got the bag back with all three items. When I got home, I saw that my \"rolls royce\" burger had no bacon. I also had a side of honey mustard, which made no sense for my order. I would not do takeout from them ever again."}
{"text":"Great food, great service; not to be missed in Madison. Our server was friendly with the kids and spoke knowledgeably about the food and beer. Two huge thumbs up for the burgers! The kids grilled cheese was basic, but that is a good thing with the tiny pallets of little ones. The server also asked on the sly if we wanted the ice cream sandwiches that comes with the kids meals. Thoughtful to ask on the down low.
Will come again."}
{"text":"This place rocks. 
It looks like a bar with tons of history.
Staff is super friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive.
The vibe is like a bar but intimate.

The food here is great.
The burgers are made to order the way you want, the garlic sauce goes perfect on the burgers to me. My favorite burger here is the kobe beef burger but even then compared to the other burgers  beef, bison,  chicken lamb etc etc it becomes a tough choice. Next time I'm in town I might just try one of each lol, yes they are that great and flavorful.

The cheese curds are awesome here.

Really can't say anything bad about this place.
I do wish it was a chain lol that is available all over the country. It beats shake shack etc etc. 

Give it a shot if you are in Madison"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I come here a lot for apps and drinks, and we always have a good time. I like the ambiance here, it is very warm and pub-like. We have sat both at the bar and at a high-top--both were nice. I recommend getting the sampler appetizer--it is has cheese curds, deep fried mushrooms, deep fried mac and cheese bites, and onion rings. The ranch sauce is amazing!

What keeps me coming back is the beer selection. I like trying new beers (with boyfriend's recommendation, of course) and I always find something I have never heard of here. 

This is a great place to take the family when they are in Madison visiting or a nice place for dinner/drinks with friends. Because of the warm, pub-like aura, I feel like this is a great place to go for dinner or a date in the winter months."}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend on a Monday night and thoroughly enjoyed Dotty's.  My biggest complaint was that the A/C was cranked and I was a little chilly during dinner.  Our server was nice and took good care of us.  The chocolate shake and root beer float were really good and the food was excellent and quickly served.  My green and gold burger was awesome with fried pickles and bacon mayo.  My boyfriend got the chili dog with cheese curds and they were both delicious as well.  Nothing fancy but the perfect burger :)"}
{"text":"Burger was good, a bit difficult holding it while eating, but well worth the effort. Enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere. Oh, and the winds were 20+ mph!"}
{"text":"Came here and sat at the bar. Atmosphere was cool, service was so-so. Ordered a burger (no fries) and cheese curds. The a la carte pricing made those two items together total almost $20.00. I'm definitely not cheap when it comes to food, but $ 12.00 for a so-so burger is expensive- especially in Madison, WI!"}
{"text":"Dotty's is probably the best place to grab a burger in Madison. I love their southwest burger and sweet potato fries. Don't miss their shakes, which are really good. Their \"sundae\" is disappointing: hard vanilla ice cream with cold syrup, not hot fudge. 

Every time I've eaten at Dotty's I've had to wait in their cramped lobby. Thankfully, I've always been seated quickly. Prices are average, which is nice for the student crowd."}
{"text":"As a visitor to Madison, I read a lot of reviews of places to gt burgers and curds. I selected DDD since it was within walking distance of my hotel and the reviewer notes that they have the best curds in town.

My party of 6 arrived around 3 on a Sunday, but the place was hopping, so we had to all sit in a booth (it was a little crowded, but we were so hungry that we did not care).  Our server took our drink and curd order and left us to peruse the various options.  The menu is pub food--very heavy on the burgers (which was fine, since that is what we wanted), but one companion did wonder...why does a place with dumpling in the name, not serve some sort of dumpling (I think she misunderstood what type of food would be available).

We all opted for local beers and burgers of a wide variety. Although the burgers do not come with fries, the 2 orders of curds were plenty to supplement the large burgers topped with delicious items (I had the green and gold with cheese and fried pickles). It was well cooked and totally hit the spot.  The curds were also delicious (although I would have to argue of the curds that i sampled on my trip, they were second to those at Graze--see my review of Graze for much more praise).

This is totally a bar that serves great bar food. Do not come here looking for anything else, but if you want that, you are in luck. They only thing that was slightly creepy were the figurines/dolls above the bar...I was not looking at them, but one of my dining companions could not stop looking at them (choose your seat wisely if dolls/clowns creep you out)."}
{"text":"Very nice place. I was there after the university had just let out so it was not packed at all. Super nice and attentive bartenders. Menu is mainly burgers, but there is something for everyone (even vegetarians). Was in town on business and ate here 2 of 3 nights because it was that good and relaxing. Met the owner and his son who were incredibly gracious."}
{"text":"Wow, amazing burgers go along with amazing service! Haris was probably the best server I've ever had, what a genuine guy! 
Thanks Dotty's!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, great beer selection, amazing burgers and the BEST fried pickles I've ever eaten- SO GOOD!! The service is really great, too."}
{"text":"This is it.  Go here when you are in Madison.  The burgers are good, but its the fried food with their GARLIC DIP  that is the best part.  Cheese Curds are a requirement or you didn't actually go to DDD."}
{"text":"Oh Dotty's....I knew ye when ye were a two story staple on State Street.  The new location isn't the same, but it is still wonderful.  Big wooden booths and the perfect dark brew-pub atmosphere.  My girlfriends and I hit it up when we are craving a big juicy burger...we love the Melting Pot Burger and the Swiss and Mushroom.  The fries are also fantastic, but you have to buy them seperately.  My mouth is watering thinking about those fantastic burgers....5 Stars."}
{"text":"Maybe I just hit Dotty's on a bad day. I found the burgers and the service just OK. The garlic mayo for the fries, that is another story, that would be a hands down 5 stars. :) When I bite into a burger I am looking for juice to start running down my chin. That didn't happen. My burger was overdone. Our server did not seem thrilled to be serving us. 

Reading all the other reviews, it does seem it was an off day. I will definitely be back to try it again."}
{"text":"Ok. So you normally have to wait awhile to sit, but it's always worth the wait. A+ burgers. I never leave here feeling anything less than fully satisfied. Thought about giving 4/5 but had to give 5/5 purely out of my experience always being great, regardless of how long I had to wait. Great food and memories at Dotties."}
{"text":"This isn't much I can say that the other yelpers haven't said already. This place is cool! The burger parties are terrific. I didn't get much info from the busy but helpful bartender but I learned they locally source as much as possible. I had the green and gold which was cooked just as I asked and it was dynamite on a brioche style bun. 
Big enough for any appetite but if I had a second chance I'd skip the fries and get 2 burgers. 
The fries were also excellent and the small portions was anything but \"small\" don't get the large unless you are a really hungry person. Don't pass up the opportunity to try the garlic mayo which went really well with the fries. 
This is a slightly divey pub with a comforting atmosphere and a friendly crowd. Lots of beers on tap and a well healed liquor selection. 
There is no parking except the street which has automated meters. 
Go try the burger I think it's a total hit!"}
{"text":"Burgers and fries. At their best. I dare say quite possibly the best burgers in Madison (in the old school burger category).

My favorite burger is probably the toadstool with swiss and wild mushrooms, but many other combinations look extremely appealing too. The runnelstone or the heartthrob or the bayou just to name a few.
They also have a variety of patties you can choose from: regular beef, bison, vegetarian, vegan, lamb, turkey... you name it. And they are delicious both medium rare and well done.

I like the fries and the onion rings too and I heard great things about the cheese curds, but I've always been here for lunch and cheese curds seem to be a bit on the heavy side if you're off to work afterwards.

The one problem with this place is service. It can be incredibly slow. Not always, but sometimes it can take 40 minutes to get a burger during lunch rush. Not fun. Also some of the servers are totally clueless.

Anyway, they do their burgers very well. And until that is true I will brave the service."}
{"text":"My mouth started watering when I typed in the name of this place to review it.  The burgers are so big, but not too big, with so many options that there's something to please everyone (except vegetarians, since half of the menu is burgers and the other half is chicken sandwiches).  Whether you want a burger dripping with multiple kinds of cheese, bursting with bacon, or piled high with veggies, this is the place to go.  Conveniently located just off of State Street to draw a slightly tamer crowd, the restaurant is large enough to handle even the largest Game Day crowds. 

Oh!  And get the cheddar munchers (deep fried mac 'n cheese bites) to start the meal- since the burgers don't come with fries, it's almost easy to justify the extra cheese :)"}
{"text":"Dotty's make great burgers, but the secret is in the various sauces. 

I shared the Heart Throb, with a creamy, jalepeno-like sauce and the Runnelstone, which is served with an English Garlic sauce. Both were delicious. As our waiter put it: \"I'd eat anything with the English garlic sauce on it.\" 

The fried cheese curds were classic Wisconsin, bready and salty and come with your choice of dipping sauces. Did I mention the sauces?

The place has an old-timey feel, and families seem to frequent the place despite being right next to one of the nation's largest university campuses. Howling college kids vs screaming children...it's a push. 

Overall, I'd recommend it for a great burger and a beer. Lots of New Glarus and Bells on tap."}
{"text":"Not a bad first stop in Madison.  Had the ginger beer and the ale asylum taster (not much pineapple in the hoppy beer, dark one was the best) to drink. 
Had the spinach salad which had decent dressing, Gorgonzola cheese, cranberries, walnuts. Pretty tasty. 
The burgers were tasty but almost too big for a single person.
Typical stop for a local Madison"}
{"text":"My all time favorite place to get a burger!

Just a scrumptious beef patty I can't feel I can compare to any other establishment!

Mustard is a must!

The malts are mighty tasty too!

I had the walleye on my most recent visit, which was pretty tasty!

All the antiques and such fixated throughout are legit!

I've been going ever since the last location on N Fairchild St!

Pretty sure I was at that location on their last day too!

Believe It!"}
{"text":"I only come here for one food: Jumbo Fries with Garlic Sauce. That's it, I'm one happy person after eating it."}
{"text":"Came in for the dumplings, sorry no dumplings you have to come in and read the story. Awesome bison burger and the onion rings where great. Will come again."}
{"text":"Let me preface: I use Yelp all the time to search for restaurants, but I basically never post reviews until now. Dotty dumplings is that good. 

I've lived in Madison for three years, and this place has the best burger I've tried in the city (I got the toadstool - delicious)! It was cooked perfectly, and the cheese, mushrooms and sauce complimented the beef beautifully.

The waitress was also incredibly friendly and prompt. I was there at 1:00 PM on a Monday afternoon, so there weren't many people there, but the food and check were very quick.

Would absolutely go back - the burger was de-freaking-licious."}
{"text":"I was told that this place has the best burgers in town and I am impressed.  I can't get over the name!

Very reasonable price ($5-7 burgers), especially given that it's a nice sit-down atmosphere, cozy, and with good service.  Other people seem to complain about the service but the one time I came here, it was very good.  The place was moderately busy when we were here, but the waitress was attentive and friendly and we received our food promptly.

I ordered the California burger, which had bacon, guacamole, tomato, and sprouts, and it was outstanding.  It could have easily been too greasy, but instead, it was light and the vegetables very fresh.  And, they do have a good beer selection too, which is an extra bonus!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service! Melting pot burger was awesome! Will be back again next time we're in town! The garlic mayo was delicious."}
{"text":"The Melting Pot Burger + Fried Cheese Curds = Heaven. It was soo good and filling that I almost didn't finish it!

This place competes for \"Best Burger in Madison\" with all the cheese + special sauce they put on their burger!"}
{"text":"A Craigslist Purchase landed us in the Madison area, so we thought we'd give this burger place a try.  My hubbie had found it previously on Yelp and had it on his wishlist of places to try.  While as you read in the other reviews, that the place is great... there are just a few things I would mention/share with those who would be interested.

- When they mean pink center for the bugers... they mean pink!  Yumminess!

- The Chili Cheese Fries are great, but they come with a ton of chili peppers and onions


Parent Notes:
- Great kids menu with burgers, grilled cheese, hot dog, corn dog & chicken fingers as the entree.  Apple sauce, fries are two of the side options.  Kiddie cocktails, soda, juice (no apple) or milk (choco too!)  are options for the drink.  All for $4.99

- The Booths are a little akward sized... there is no overlap between the table and the booth its self - so my toddler in a booster seat slipped a few times.  Luckily I had one of those handy table attached seats in the car, which worked great!

- Being in a campus town, there was enough noise from people talking that my toddler making lots of noises was not notices.  But enough families that we didn't feel like outsiders."}
{"text":"This burger was delicious and amazing as promised by the staff at the Masison Concourse! There was a game about to start when I tried to get a seat at this hot spot, so rsther then wait, it was suggested by the hostest to order to go at the bar, which I did. Sara the bar tender was such a sweet woman who made me an amazing Old Fashion for $7 as I awaited my food! Which was better then the one I've tried at Johnny Delmanacos. The staff were all very nice and friendly. Great establishment. Very Impressed."}
{"text":"Great cozy burger place.  Neat, eclectic decor.  Friendly and efficient wait staff.  

We had cheese curds as a starter, very tasty and done just right.  Also had the fried pickles, thought they were ok.  

Had a classic burger.  Wow that was terrific.  Very tasty sauce, nice toppings and great bun.  Great french fries.  

Paired with a spotted cow.  

Over all very tasty.

Would definitely come back again to this lovely establishment."}
{"text":"Menu says \"all burgers come medium-pink unless otherwise requested\" but our entire table received well done burgers. Plus they're about the size of McDonald's patties, not very impressive. At least they tasted good due to all the toppings!"}
{"text":"The cheese curds and the hamburgers are awesome! They also have a nice selection of cold and good beer!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Madison. Avoid ordering to-go but great for sitting down with a beer and some cheese curds. 

Maytag blue cheese and bacon burger gets my vote for best overall burger in the state. The \"melting pot\" with their English garlic sauce is rich, silky, and delicious. Good onion rings, fries, and fried mac and cheese squares, though cheese curds have declined in recent years. They used to have the best curds in town too.

Burgers, when prepared correctly, are wonderful. The big detraction is that their buns are infamously crumbly and stale. I've had some of the most delicious meals in town here, though they need to change their buns and make sure burgers are cooked to the requested temperature every time. I'm also surprised but happy to say that I think Dotty's has the best salads in town. Generous fresh portions of roughage and veggies.

Service is basically a rotating menagerie of soon-to-be-fired UW students. To-go orders always come home wrong. If you go in looking to chill and not worried about service, especially during off hours, this one of the great places to sit down with a Spotted Cow and Wisconsin junk food. A great place for tourists to get a feel for Madison too."}
{"text":"A restaurant to stand the test of time! I am a regular, my partner requests it to be ready at the bus stop whenever she visits Madison. 

Still one of the three best burgers in Madison, with Brothers Three and Weary Traveler. 

Very consistent quality, no disappointments with anything I or my companions have ever ordered. 

I particularly like the Heartthrob, Grand dad, Toadstool, Bison, Bayou, Melting Pot burger. The salmon salad is great. 

You MUST order the sample basket. 

You will not get a table on game day. Don't even try."}
{"text":"I like to come to Dotty's after work sometimes for an old-fashioned and a burger. The place is a little touristy, but I'd prefer that to a rowdy college fratboy scene. The drinks are reasonably priced, and the burgers are good if not rather messy (almost to the point of being annoying on several occasions). The one thing I will note is that the bar staff is at times somewhat inattentive. Towards the end of the night (they close at midnight) you might find them at the end of the bar near the grill chatting with coworkers while you wait to place an order or your glass is empty. Other than that, this place is worth checking out if you in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Delish. If you're in the mood for burgers, hot dogs, and chili fries, this is your place. I even got the bbq chicken salad and it was great. Super fun atmosphere and music, too."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was incredible and with the jazz and black and white tv shows playing and the food was some of the best I've had and is in my definite top 5 burgers."}
{"text":"This place had really good burgers. I have the granddaddy burger and it was really good my girlfriend had the pub burger and it was good as well but she had a hair on it. The waitress told us that she would have replaced it we would've told her but my girlfriend just ate it anyways. Overall the beers are really cold. Great atmosphere. Cheese curds french fries and then it rings were really really good. I would definitely go back. The granddaddy burger is the Kirby and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Great burger, and chili fries. The chili there was as described, with the chunks of meat. Good chili flavor, nice amount of chile on the fries. Loved it, and they put some nice hot peppers on. Had the bayou burger, wife and I both thought it was well covered with the onion strips, and the sauce was tasty, spicy (for her, I added extra hot sauce). Good burger to bun ratio I thought. Had a house salad to help the digestion ;-) can't say if it is best in town since I haven't been to all but it was better than our favorite place back home..."}
{"text":"Tasty, but very greasy burger. This is a great place for a quick unhealthy lunch, or to take out-of-state visitors for exactly the food they are expecting to eat in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever eaten was here: The Runnelstone. Juicy, sloppy, medium well goodness on a bun that was able to handle it and keep it all together, add cheddar cheese, their signature garlic sauce,  and fried onions to that mix and damn my mouth was in it for the long haul. The fries were decent, as well, our waitress attentive and quick to get our orders in and food to our table. The atmosphere was great, the lighting was dim and we were sat in a corner that hid us away from everyone with the high wooden backs to our booth. Twilight Zone was playing on the t.v. above our heads but it was close captioned so we could take it in or ignore it which made our experience enjoyable. 

You want a good burger you come here. They have at least four concoctions of their own making that have made them famous. They also serve lamb burgers, which I just have to try next time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in my home town. Staff is full of unbelievably engaging fun and attentive smoke shows. I recommend Stanley's blue ribbon w a veggie patty added on top and a side of sweet potatoe fries. If it's leg day add a vanilla malt with a slice of fudge bottom pie in it, or a Travis Haases Apple Pie Alamode Vanilla Malt."}
{"text":"Great wait staff...really nice.  stopped by for lunch yesterday.  food was ok, nothing special...had the chili. Yummy chocolate malt!"}
{"text":"We were tired after a long day and this place with its unique name definitely caught my eye.  As this is a straight food review (we ordered take out and brought it back to the hotel), I'll stick to my typical pro's and con's.

Pro: Good sourcing, good products, very good portion size (just got a burger, no side).  Cooked perfect (medium, woo!  Not overdone at all!) and nice crisp toppings.  I got the lamb burger.  Very tasty and hit the spot.

Con's: Well, I shouldn't say con's, but more 'suggestions'.  For Dotty's, when take out is ordered, it would be nice to mark which burger is which.  Sometimes it's hard to tell.  Luckily, my feta cheese is easy to catch.  For the take out patron, the food cools down quick.  Still good, but I know my burger would have tasted that much more awesome if it had been hotter.  Still really good, but next time, we'll eat in.  It's a la carte, folks, so just remember, fries are extra.

If you want a really good burger in Madison, be sure to check this place out."}
{"text":"Folks if you ever find yourself in Madison, Wi stop by. Someone call the food network they have obviously missed one of best burger places in America. 

We all have that nostalgic place from our hometown or college where we thought the food was the \"bomb\" ( that's right I'm dating myself). This place is where you take the parents for a good affordable fun meal before you hit them up for cash and leave until Thanksgiving. 

I had the a burger with three different takes of cheese and bacon with their house garlic sauce. It came with a side of fries that you dream about crisp, pillowy and hot. These were the best fries I've had in years. I actually given up on fries because no one does them right until now. 

I'm only in Madison for 3 days but I may have to break my rules and return to this place. It makes me wonder will I miss another really good place while I'm in town."}
{"text":"It's funny because six years ago, my review would have been 5 stars.  Not so much now.  I used to eat at Dotty's all the time at the old location.  Now that it's moved, I think I've been there once.

I love the burgers, cheese curds, and the fries, but now that it's a sit-down place with waiters and stuff, I feel like their kind-of-pricey-burgers should be like a meal thing.  

I guess what it really is, is that old place was a lot more fun.  The new location seems like it has more of a \"I just drove my SUV 40 miles to see a hockey game in Madison and now I'm hungry\" feel to it."}
{"text":"Wisconsin cheese belongs on Wisconsin burgers. A staple for the kids of UW Madison, this tavern-style restaurant offers a lot in the way of burger selection. I enjoyed the Runnelstone immensely and the garlic sauce, though very heavy in mayo, was darn tasty. I also enjoyed the basket of fried deliciousness that came as an appetizer. Fried Cheese Curds are better than any cheese in California."}
{"text":"Fantastic as always! You simply can't go wrong with your menu choice. We love the food, service and the atmosphere. My favorite for cheese curds! A real Madison gem."}
{"text":"Creatively named burgers adorn the menu at Dotty Dumpling's Dowry, like the Heart Throb, the Melting Pot, and the Billy Goat. We decided to stop in for lunch before getting our drive to Milwaukee underway, and we immediately set to work trying to choose from among the many char grilled sandwich options.

We started things off by ordering fried cheese curds from our friendly waitress, and they were excellent with a side of ranch, or particularly with the English Garlic sauce that also comes on some of the burgers. I ultimately decided on the Gladiator burger which, while it sounds imposing, was actually a quite manageable burger. Biting into the soft, buttery buns, the burger was charred at the edges yet pink and juicy in the middle, in this case stacked with Muenster cheese, bacon, red onions, and their special Boomerang sauce: a mustard blend that is sure to keep you coming back. One of my companions got what is perhaps Dotty's signature burger, Stanley's Blue Ribbon, and was duly impressed with the cream cheese, BBQ sauce, and onion ring topped burger. There are many other compelling \"adventurous alternatives\" on the menu, like the buffalo, turkey, or veggie burgers, or the tantalizing Mediterranean style lamb burger with feta cheese. I only wish we had more time in Madison to give them a whirl.

The name Dotty Dumpling's Dowry calls to mind some greasy spoon diner with a hair-netted waitress named Flo with a pencil tucked behind her ear. But in actuality, Dotty's is a nice place with dark wood, elegant fixtures, vintage aerospace models hanging from the ceiling, and old movies playing on several of the TV's. Dotty's is certainly Madison's hamburger headquarters."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The cheese curds were the best I've ever had. The melting pot burger is amazing everyone should try it. My boyfriend had the kobe beef burger and that was a whole different level. I can't believe I hadn't tried this place before. The service was amazing and the selection of beers was great."}
{"text":"Wonderful burgers and great sauces.  A bit pricey and most of the offerings are a la cart but it's worth going."}
{"text":"If Dotty's was in Chicago it would be a very popular spot and I'd be there all the time. Luckily, Madison is not too far from Chicago and when I come up for a Badgers game or just to visit, I take in Dotty's for their ridiculously good burgers and their selection of fine Wisconsin beers.  Where else can go get a pitcher of New Glarus Spotted Cow and a burger with English garlic sauce, swiss, cheddar and provolone, and bacon? This would be the melting pot burger and it would be delicious.

The meat is fresh ground chuck and it's juicy and always cooked to order. The Runnelstone and the Black and Blue are good bets and next time I'm in I'll try something else.  Burgers are priced about standard for the quality you get and extra toppings like bacon, jalapeno bacon, roasted red pepper or sauteed mushrooms are $0.75 extra.  The burgers don't come with fries but you get a lot for $2. Or, go for fried cheese curds, fried mushrooms, onion rings or other goodies.  

If cow meat is not your thing, you can get a variety of chicken sandwiches, a turkey burger, lamb burger, veggie or buffalo burger. Dotty's also has salads, chili and soup, ahi tuna steak, portabella mushroom sammy, fish sandwiches, brats, corn dogs, and did I mention Spotted Cow?

Friendly and attentive service is standard and be prepared to wait a long time on game days.  However, you can't miss going to Dotty's for a real Wisconsin bar experience. Beautiful wood paneling throughout, a great long wood bar and lots of Wisconsin memorabilia line the walls. The bar just has a great feel to it without being forced.  I am so glad Dotty's opened back up several years ago after closing for 3 years just after I started school in Madison. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Best burger I have had in a long time.  My wife gives two thumbs up for the vegetarian selections.  The service is top notch.  We came in with our two girls in the Burley stroller and they made every accommodation for us.  The waitress was very patient with the girls who had a ton of questions.  We can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"The best burger and cheese curds I have ever had. I was in town for the weekend and ate at this place twice. Can be a wait at certain times, but it is worth it. The food is fresh and prepared how you want it.  They have a good menu for pub food lovers. Staff is very friendly and  food comes out pretty quick. If you are in Madison this is a must try."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the name. Great burgers (the menu is a la carte). The place is charming with the wood booth seats. We had the toadstool and the Mediterranean lamb burgers. The lamb burger was great ;)"}
{"text":"one of the better places in madison. great beer selection. burger and onion rings were good"}
{"text":"From the rave reviews, I gave this place a try. I ordered a bison burger and truffle fries. The burger overall was quite bland. The meat and special sauce lacked flavor. The soft brioche-like buns were the only good thing about it. The truffle fries barely had any truffle taste and the cheese was just a sprinkle. Green onions and smoked bacon were a plus. Im not sure what the hype is. I come from the west coast known for great burgers. Overall disappointing."}
{"text":"People say best burgers around, totally misleading statement. Food was ok, nothing above and beyond."}
{"text":"We had the most wonderful experience at this authentic Wisconsin pub & restaurant. Rarely do you find a place where the atmosphere, the food  and the staff all are excellent! If you are ever in Madison, WI this place is worth a trip. The neighborhood is a little busy. But it is worth it. 

We had Sage as our server, she was very friendly and helpful.

Here is a little tip, there is a parking garage just North of the restaurant on Francis St."}
{"text":"Possibly the best burgers in Madison -- juicy, decadent, cheese-tastic.  Great service, huge baskets of fries, and obscure old movies on the TVs.  What's not to like?  Well, maybe the parking situation, but the parking garage across the street generally provides paid spots."}
{"text":"Mmmm, Dowry burgers.  These are some of the best burgers I've ever had.  The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that no sides are included in the price.  It's not like some fries or a side salad on a $6-8 burger would break the bank, guys.

Also, *excellent* drink special on Thursdays."}
{"text":"The BEST veggie burger I have ever had. Dottys is a must eat if you want a good American style restaurant! Curds are also amazing ;-)"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Dotty's since it was a hole in the wall where you could get a giant burger and fries for under $5.

It was ranked one of the top burgers 10 burgers in the country.  I have traveled extensively, Dotty's is my #1.  To the gentleman who said he had better burgers in DC, please tell me where?  I didnt find anything half this good when I lived there.

If you havent eaten here before, make your first burger the Melting Pot.  I get mine with lettuce, tomato, fried onions, and extra garlic sauce.  After that you may want to try some of the many other options, but make this one your first.

If you like cheese curds, or even if you dont, get the cheese curds, with garlic sauce for dipping.  Best cheese curds I've found outside of a state fair.

Fried Mac & Cheese Wedges are another favorite.  You can get a basket of fries to share with 2-4 people, and you can make them chilli cheese fries which are awesome.  The malteds are great.  I've heard the pie and drinks on tap are great, although I havent tried either.

The prices have steadily gone up in the decades I've been a patron, and it's harder and harder to find parking, or get quick takeout.  These days I only go when I plan to sit down.  The atmosphere is excellent and they almost always have really good music playing, often of very random genres.

If you're like me and are on a mission to know where all the good burgers are, here are my other local stops:  Player's Bar & Grill on Winnebago.  Not quite as much flavor as Dotty's, but damn it's an impressive hunk of meat.  Weary Traveler on Williamson.  Everything here is excellent and many swear by the burger.  Grumpy Troll in Mt Horeb, personally this isnt one of my favorites but their burgers are renowned and I will eat one if I'm there.  And Five Guys.  Chain nonwithstanding, if you dont love Five Guys, I dont trust you on burgers.

Oh I forgot to mention-- Village Bar on Mineral Point was picked by the Food Network as one of the top burgers in country.  I tried one and couldnt have been more disappointed.  It was tiny and flavorless, like a cafeteria burger.  I did enjoy their smoked sausage sandwich and it's a great little spot."}
{"text":"Two words: BISON BURGER.

I could just end my review there, to be honest. That's really all you need to know. However, if I must go on, let me say that the fries here are pretty banging too and I love the old timey movies playing (The Manchurian Candidate was on when my mom and I were there).

The new location is a bit dark and very pub-y, but has a good, casual ambiance full of wooden booths and friendly servers. Nothing fancy here - come for a casual dining experience and enjoy a plethora of burger options (including veggie burgers for all your vegan and vegetarians out there). For you carnivores, again: get the BISON BURGER and call it a day. You will thank me later!"}
{"text":"Have been to Dotty's a few times now and it is definitely the place I go when craving a burger.  It's rare to find a place that actually cooks your burger the way it's ordered, but Dotty's does just that every.single.time.  Great combinations too.  

Service... excellent every single time too."}
{"text":"AMAZING! My husband and I are here for a short visit from Alabama and we dropped into Dotty Dumpling's Dowry and I'm so incredibly glad we did! The cheese curds were to die for, my Green and Gold burger was perfection, and I want to take all their pickles home with me. 

Sage was our server and she is INCREDIBLE! If you go to Dotty's, ask to sit with Sage - I know I will when we come back on our next trip!"}
{"text":"Whoever married Dotty Dumpling better like burgers.  What is there not to like?  Judging from most reviews not a thing.  So I checked this place out and had one of the best tasting burgers I have ever had. 
Mine was the Melting Pot burger with an absolutely delicious garlic sauce.  No catsup or mustard needed unless you so desire.   The Grand Daddy burger was delicious too according to someone else in my group.
I would say the burger was better than a great burger.  It had something special due to its great combination of flavor, juiciness, delicious cheese and cooked perfectly.  Our service was perfect, not too little and not too much.  The place is a bit dark inside.  Might be nice for a date but to me it felt a bit too dingy.  Entire staff was professional.  The bathroom was very clean.  So nice to see this.  Open kitchen is nice.  Second time I saw this this week and I think it really gives people a sense of what goes on in the kitchen isn't being hidden behind the wall.
As I go back for more I suspect this place will move up to 5 stars.  Don't let me down Dotty."}
{"text":"The good:
1. My burger was delicious and there were lots of interesting options.  My burger was juicy, perfectly cooked to order and had great, fresh toppings. You can smell the charbroiled flavor the minute you walk in. My mouth was watering as soon as I stepped through the doorway. 

The bad:
1. I had the most popular burger- the Melting pot. It had three pieces of cheese that didn't totally melt and bacon which I didn't taste because the burger flavor was overpowering. 
2. I realize we were in Wisconsin,land of beer, but a more extensive wine list would have been nice. 

The verdict: keep it simple and go for a plain cheeseburger and beer. It won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Buffalo burger and the cheese curds were amazing. We had really great service as well. We were recommended this place by the hotel we were staying at, definitely a good place to stop by when you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Best burger in Madison hands down! I always get the Melting Pot. There's a reason it is their most sold burger. Oh, and it is topped with bacon, so there's that. The burgers are big. Call me a wimp, but I always ask for a knife so I can cut mine in half.

If you get fries, get a basket to share amongst yourselves. Unfortunately the burgers do not come with fries. There is malt vinegar on the table to make your fries English style...always a plus

Warning: Do not come here on a night that there is a sporting event at the Kohl Center. Or, if you do, be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Dotty's is home to the best burgers in Madison.  They also have a pretty solid selection of beers on tap and good sides."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Dotty's every time I've been there.  Love their Black and Bleu burger, and they've got decent beer selection.  Never had any problem with the service.  Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Oh, it's been a while, Triple D.

Before they moved, DDD was on State Street and there was a kayak that hung over your head.  It was hard to enjoy your burgers with that kayak there because I was so sure the rigging would snap and the kayak would hit me mid-burger bite.

Seems like the kayak was put into storage for the North Frances location.  We split Friday fish fry and the California burger, hold the sprouts.  Both were delicious and warm and made me forget about the cold that awaited outside.  There was lots of cool UW memorabilia inside and it made me swoon nostalgic for my college days.  There were lots of cozy booths and everyone seemed to be genuinely enjoying themselves for a late night dinner.  Really good, chill crowd.

On a sidenote, I needed to charge my phone while we were having dinner and the hostess complied with my request.  She seemed like a totally normal girl but was totally awkward with an adult speaking to her.  Ahhh, what it's like to be an awkward college student who can't fathom what 25 will look or feel like.  Ignorance really is bliss."}
{"text":"Still the same great food I remember from a decade plus ago. The curds are the best I have ever found and the burgers are right there as well. Service is always friendly and the prices are quite affordable. If you are looking to get yo drank on, you can do that here as well. Definitely recommend a stop if you find yourself in the area."}
{"text":"This place is purty damn good if you're looking for a tasty burger/ some mouthwatering fried goods! Cheese curds are out of this world and I'm adding them to my top 3 in Madison list (currently consisting of these, the Nitty and Roast, but very subject to change). I like the dark mood lighting and the old school UW feel here! Bring your fam, bring your friends, most importantly bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"One of the better burger places I've been to. I looked the ambiance with almost a speak easy feel."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Madison I have to eat at Dotty Dumplings Dowry!  There's usually a wait but, the wait is worth in.  Starting with the hostess, it was super busy today but, the hostess was calm and smiling.  She kept tellung us thank you for waiting and she was sorry for the wait.  She told us our wait would be 50mins and we was seated and had placed our order within that time.    We had the pleasure of having the lovely Nichole as our server.  Nichole was awesome!  She was friendly, smiling, and her food suggestions was a big help!  You want regret eating there!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Wow! The Bayou (turkey) burger was fantastic!! I don't know how they made the perfect balance of mayo, cheese, and other toppings, but they did. It was perfectly proportioned not overly filling and very satisfying meal. Great list of beers to boot!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. Our waitress was nice! Didn't think it was the best burger I had though. My sister loved their garlic mayo and it reminded her of the garlic mayo she was served with fish in Ireland. Cheese curds were great too! Strong drinks too :)"}
{"text":"awesome burgers,local craft beers, and good curds. if you want at least one of those you wont be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Great burgers -- strict rules. 

Check whether there is an event at the Kohl Center -- or a Wisconsin game on TV --  before trying to grab dinner at Dotty's. They enforce an hour-limit per table, which isn't that big of a deal (especially if you don't care about said game) except that they're pushy about it. The host will tell you. The server will tell you. There's a sign on the table. We get it - leave after an hour. 

Also, our server told us on our last visit: no split tickets. This is one of my restaurant pet peeves considering the computer system is almost always capable of doing this work automatically. And lest you forget, your 60 minutes are ticking away while you figure out the bill. 

Conclusion: You'll have great food at Dotty's, but go here for a quick bite with a small group (preferably  on the same ticket) on a non-game night."}
{"text":"Crazy good burgers! If yer not afraid of rich, cheesy-mayo decadence get yerself a melting pot."}
{"text":"Dotty's obviously doesn't need my review, but I'm adding it anyway! I recently visited during my first ever trip to Madison, and was instantly hooked. The fried cheese curds (a first for this East coast guy) were amazing, and the locals I was with mentioned that Dotty's were - in their opinion - the best in town. 

A great selection of burgers, including buffalo and vegetarian options. I had the California burger with sprouts and guacamole, and unlike a lot of burger joints, the darn thing was actually cooked properly! When they said pink through the middle, they meant it. Halfway through the meal I stopped caring how messy I was getting. Oh, and as an added bonus, the service was friendly and reasonably prompt. I hope to be back one day....!"}
{"text":"After living in the Bay Area for nearly four years, and visiting several delicious burger joints, I was a little skeptic of my fond memories of delicious burgers from Dotty Dumpling's. It turns out, however, that Dotty Dumpling's still serves up some of the best burgers I've ever had.

On my last visit a few days ago, I ordered the Californian, my boyfriend got the newest addition, the Heart Throb, and we both had a beer. My Californian was so, so delicious. The burger was perfectly cooked to medium, and it had the best beefy taste I've come across in awhile. I also liked how the cold ingredients were piled on the bottom, and the burger, bacon and cheese on top; I think it helps the cheese melt better.

I had a small taste of the spicy sauce from my boyfriend's Heart Throb. From the taste of it, the sauce had jalapeno, cilantro and lime. I'm sure when paired with the cheese (pepper-jack, I believe) and bacon, that made for one delicious burger...I kinda wish that I would have ordered that one!

If you're a fan of burgers, stop by Dotty Dumpling's. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great beer. Loved the Huron Brewing Company and the Cowgirl's salad. Cheese curds were phenomenal!! My Dad's burger was a bit overdone and on the menu, it specifically said they always keep a little pink in the middle and it was pretty cooked through. But overall, great atmosphere, friendly staff, little to no wait. Would come back!"}
{"text":"Nice burgers with options for everybody. Bun was soft, but held up nicely. I chose the Melting Pot and tasted great, but I've had better burgers in places like Five Guys.

They sell themselves as the Hamburguers HQ of the world, which is catchy.

The place is great to hangout with friends, have a couple of beers, etc.... expect long lines...."}
{"text":"Fun traditional burger joint to chow down at before a Badger basketball or hockey game! Their curds are excellent and have a tap beer menu that most Wisconsinites would be proud of. A slew of burgers and sandwich options to order from. Also, the atmosphere is a little darker with a lot of nick nacks and photos co wrong the walls."}
{"text":"I was blown away by the burgers! I got the Heart Throb  and my son got the Grand Daddy. I thought the Heart Throb was pretty amazing until my son let me try a bite of the Grand Daddy. I cannot proper explain how delicious, rich, and flavorful that burger was. Consider my mind blown! We also had the chili cheese fries and fried pickles. The chili on the fries was really good with big chunks of tender beef. Plan on sharing and it's a huge order!"}
{"text":"I was tricked into coming here.  This place serves burgers and pretty much nothing else.  They offer a home-made vegan patty on the menu, but it turns out there are no vegan buns.  The waitress was kind enough to offer to put the patty on top of a couple pieces of lettuce, which is slightly better than what we've experience some other places.  But, if you are serious about trying to cater to us dietary weirdos, please go the extra step and save a spot in your freezer for a couple frozen vegan buns from Whole Foods.  You can them pop in the oven for 8 minutes on the rare occasion a vegan actual tries to partake of your otherwise flavorful offerings."}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed by the food here. Everything will taste solid and they have a decent selection of interesting food for those who want to try something different."}
{"text":"Any place that has a charcoal grill will win me over! On top of that, Dottys has such a wide variety of burgers and toppings that there is something for everyone. The sides range from
fantastic to amazing, guaranteed to satisfy any craving! For dessert I love a good strawberry shake which they make with chocolate shoppe ice cream on an old fashion spindle so they are nice and thick! You can really tell that the staff enjoys working there and it's fun to see the open kitchen while your meal is prepared!!! 

A must eat place!"}
{"text":"Dotty's is excellent burger joint in Madison! I had the Melting Pot which is a burger with bacon, three types of cheese and a special sauce. It was delicious! I have only gone there before Badger Games at the Kohl Center and on those days, it is extremely crowded. They are not a huge restaurant so get there early because most people stay till just before game time. I also had a Bloody Mary but I wasn't a huge fan of the Tomato juice mix and the seasoning. Overall, I would and plan to go back for the food. If you are looking for some of the best burgers and other fried foods in Madison, try Dotty's!"}
{"text":"It kills me to give this place two stars, because I want to love it so, so badly.  WHY DO YOU MAKE IT SO HARD FOR ME TO LOVE YOU, DDD?  

Let's start with the good.  I love the beer selection here, I love that you can get Ale Asylum Pantheon consistently, and the fries are fantastic.  Burgers are good.  Good selection, generally good execution.  Cheese curds are above average.

However.

It seems like every time we come here, there's an issue, and it's usually with the burger buns.  Specifically, they come out partially frozen, and if you send them back, they come out partially frozen.  This has happened a number of times in a row, and seems to be more frequent with the veggie burger that my wife orders.  I think, of all the times we've come here, I've been able to eat at the same time as my wife exactly once due to some issue.  We're not relentless customizers or anything, it's just the same issue over and over.

I've been sticking to things with animal products in them, and the buns are mostly fine, though the frozen bun thing has happened once or twice to me as well.  That said, the non-burger sandwiches aren't anything special.

I usually give places a pretty long leash, but there are better options closer to home that don't require parking around campus, and are a safer bet in terms of consistency.  I can go to Vintage Brewing, it's a mile from my house, they have their own parking lot, and my food there is never frozen."}
{"text":"Just based on the name, who doesn't want to spend at least one of their evenings at Dotty Dumplings?

Not only was the name intriguing, but the great reviews on Yelp and its proximity to our hotel made it an easy choice for dinner on our last night in. That, and we hadn't *quite* met our quota of cheese curds and these were allegedly a delicious option.

They are, in fact, a delicious option. So try them. But when you do, keep in mind that the portions of everything are GIGANTIC. We made the mistake of order two sides in addition to our entrees, and let's just say there were some pissed off starving children in Africa that night. Two people could easily eat the (delicious) chili cheese fries as an entire meal. 

Bringing me, naturally, to the chili. Which had excellent flavor and spice. More importantly, the meat they use is obviously well cooked and a high quality--it's not your standard ground beef but rather a stew-type meat that falls apart in your mouth. You could put it on a grasshopper and I'd be willing to eat it. The burgers are juicy and delicious, and their caesar salad was huge, fresh, and really flavorful. Their beer list is, as in much of Madison, locally-based, quite large, and with a lot of delicious options.

The service was okay, and either our waitress was very forgetful or completely in the weeds. But at least she was friendly! 

So even if you can't say the name five times fast (or even really remember where it is you're eating), you should probably wander over here at some point. But, beware, if you order as much as we did you're going to have some seriously ticked starving children to answer to."}
{"text":"Have tried many burger places in town and this place has the best burgers! We love eating here. Their burgers that have cream cheese on them are delicious! Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Why is this called \"Dotty Dumpling's Dowry\" when pretty much all they have are burgers?  Well, they're good burgers.

I got a special which included Hook's Blue Cheese and caramelized onions.  While I personally would have liked to have had more cheese, they burger was good, overall.  The fries were nicely salted and the right crispiness for my liking.  They have a pretty great beer list too!"}
{"text":"Super tasty spot!  My fiancé and I were in Madison for a football game, and a lot of people recommended this place to us.  The wait was kind of long, but we got some drinks and chilled for about 45 minutes until our table was ready.  Once we were seated, we loved the cheese curds and the burgers we ordered.  The cheese on them was especially delicious--thanks, Wisconsin!"}
{"text":"very tasty and interesting burgers.  I like the basil burger the best.  Very nice for an intimate place with american style burgers.  Probably the classiest burger joint I've been to"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, sweet potato fries and chocolate shake.  We had the melting pot burger which is rated best burger and it lived up to the rating!  Service was prompt with our order."}
{"text":"I'm a longtime fan of Dotty's. The service is consistent, the decor is always interesting including old movies playing on the TVs, which is fun, and the food is just yummy, happy, satisfying goodness. The Melting Pot and the Runnelstone are my 2 top picks for burgers. The Melting Pot comes with 3 kinds of cheese (cheddar, Swiss  & provolone) and thick, gorgeous bacon. The Runnelstone has cheddar and caramelized onions. And the English garlic sauce on both is a mayo lovers dream - SO GOOD on pretty much anything! Oh and the cheese curds.........some of the best in the city with a nice ranch dipping sauce. I've always been curious about their Bloody Mary, but have yet to give that a try. Stop into Dotty's when you have a major burger hankering - you'll be super happy you did!"}
{"text":"The crowds here are a good sign. I've had the spicy black bean veggie burger, vegan burger, and fried cod sandwich. All are delicious.

I'm docking one star because I really think the burgers/sandwiches should come with at least a small side (a few fries? some steamed broccoli?). I've always found a burger/sandwich on its own leaves something to be desired, but ordering a side to go with it is too much food/too pricey. I usually split an order of cheese curds with whoever I'm with, and those usually hit the spot."}
{"text":"Food: 4
Service: 3
Uniqueness: 4

----------------------------------------------------------------
Being so close to the Kohl Center, this place can get really busy and the service can take a hit. If you're in the area, try it for lunch on a non-gameday.

Dotty's is a Madison legend. The food here isn't pretentious or super unique, it's just deliciously prepared with a lot of fried stuff. The fried mac and cheese bites and the fried mushrooms are must haves for me. They come with an excellent garlic dipping sauce that will blow your mind. The burgers are awesome because you can totally customize them to what you want. 

If you haven't tried bison before, definitely give it a shot here as it's one of the only places that offers it as a choice. It's got a different flavor and is leaner than beef but it's really tasty."}
{"text":"It had a large variety of burgers, good beer selection, crispy fries, and a fun atmosphere. The burgers did not come with a side of fries. It did NOT however have dumplings, instead mainly burgers. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Food: They have good beer flights if you want to sample a bunch of the local brews. I started things off with the Wisco Road Trip. Then for my meal, I ordered the Melting Pot Burger. It came with Cheddar, Swiss, and Provolone cheese, Jones Diary Farm smoked bacon, and their signature English garlic sauce. I can definitely see and taste why it's their number one selling burger! I finished things off with the Mad City Flight.

Service: I received excellent service. The waitress always checked up on me. Not once did I feel neglected. I even had a booth all to myself.

Overall: I've eaten my fair share of burgers and the one I had here easily ranks at the top. I would definitely want to come back here to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Food ok. Service consistently poor to awful. Lighting painfully low. 

Specialty burger restaurant whose burger patties are only ok - today dry, rubbery, fairly flavourless though previously better - and flavour combinations pretty mediocre. Assorted deep fried foods are pretty good including the very expensive cheese curds. I had the toadstool burger. The mushrooms and cheese faded away against the charred flavour of the patty which was slightly pink inside and black on the outside. The bun was soggy. The garlic sauce remarkably tasty. For $7.50 ish I felt ripped off. Would recommend getting a cheeseburger to go from five guys to be honest!

Service has been poor on previous visits and today was especially bad. \"Emily\" took her time before she finally came by our table. Then she asked us for our drink orders three times in the space of two minutes. Then a five minute gap... When I said we were ready to order she inexplicably turned around, walked off and disappeared for another five minutes. The rest of the service was adequate in a surly teenage kinda way though she also failed to mention that the cider on the menu was listed incorrectly. When it arrived it was actually peach flavoured and not to my taste at all. However I couldn't be bothered wrestling with her further so can't really blame the restaurant entirely for having suffered through an entire glass of the stuff. 

Overall, we will not be returning. Between the dingy lighting (I think meant to create atmosphere...?!!!), the mediocre, overpriced food and the appalling service I would recommend you go elsewhere too."}
{"text":"Time has not treated you well, Dotty.  Almost 20 years ago in college (god that sounds that a long time ago), I visited Dotty's when it was located on Regent St.  A small place that delivered an absolutely amazing burger.  I still remember it to this day.  Fast forward to today and Dotty's is not even close to what it once was.  Yes, it still carries a strong brand recognition in Madison but let's face it, the burger scene in Madison is hyper competitive and there are at least 7 other places that produce a superior sandwich.  Way too much sauce, the meat lacked flavor and didn't appear to be hand pattied the way they once were. What once was is now very pedestrian and unerwhelming.  Sure, they will attract the people that stroll by on their way to a Kohl Center event but won't be attracting me anytime soon."}
{"text":"Still the go to burger place in Madison!   Cooked to order and the sauces make the difference. Cheese curds are some of the best as well. Order the English garlic sauce as a side."}
{"text":"After browsing the Yelp reviews for the best lunch and burgers, I convinced my extended family to dine here for lunch. I was really excited and knew I would order the Melting Pot burger. 

The short review is that it just isn't that good. I'll confess to being a foodie and probably a borderline burger critic. So with that said, I'm not saying that Dotty's doesn't have great burgers or service. What I am saying is that I've had better tasting burgers. I think that their menu items have potential but that there are things they could do to elevate my taste buds.

Now, for the long review. We ordered cheese curds for the table. These were pretty good but over-cooked. The batter was tasty and not too heavy. But since they were overcooked we were left with a lot of cheesey batter bites rather than cheese curds. The ranch dressing/dip they were served with was delicious (and upon asking for more, we were notified we'd be charged for it). 

I ordered the Melting Pot burger (3 kinds of cheese, garlic mayo, bacon, I added tomato and lettuce). It was just fine (however the rest of my party was satisfied probably because they frequent WI burger places and I frequent DC burger places).  More details: Unless you otherwise specify, all burgers are served medium. My burger was medium, so hooray! The meat itself was good but was a bit bland. Spice it up a bit! (I'm guessing the oil or whatever they cook them in overwhelms the beef). The three cheeses were piled on each other and weren't melted entirely. The garlic mayo (called garlic sauce) was not that garlic-y. And as for the bacon, I could barely taste it and I'm not even kidding you! So maybe the bacon was under-cooked? Either way, it should stand out somewhat. The bun, was lovely!! Light, fluffy and the flavor was complimentary to the burger. However, if you order your burger and it sits for a while, it could get soggy.

So overall, it was fine. If this place is convenient, go there! Everything was reasonably priced and their beer menu features 89% locally brewed beer (super great!). Fries/sides are a la carte but you can easily eat a burger, add fries and have a beer for $15. The service we received was great!  But if you eat a lot of burgers, this place will just leave you searching for a better one with better ingredients. 

Also, if you drive here, there is street parking available and there are two parking ramps, on is on Francis and Johnson St, the other is across University, on Francis, past Wandos & the Red Barn. If the one on Francis and Johnson is full, try the other one and find it by passing Wandos, and turning left before you run into the dead end."}
{"text":"My only lament about Dotty Dumpling's is that they stopped serving the ostrich burger before I got to try it. Woe.

Other than that--I don't know what else I can say other than: Best. Burgers. Evar."}
{"text":"I got their \"famous\" multi cheese burger. From the description I expected it to be a bit more cheesy. Didn't appreciate that the up charge for sweet potato fries was almost 3 dollars. Their ranch dressing (I'm a ranchaholic) was off putting... It tasted like they had dumped massive amounts of rosemary in it. 
The buyer I ordered medium and came medium rare almost on the line of rare. I like that, but my father and mother were very unhappy. The decor is nice and the staff was friendly. The beer I had was delicious... But for the good we received... The prices were pretty unrealistic. Wouldn't recommend it or go back."}
{"text":"The good: Everything. Seriously though, from the delicious cheese curds to the vanilla and fudge pie we were practically licking the plates. My husband got the melting pot burger and it was incredible-the cheese was all melted and gooey and paired with the bacon and patty perfectly. I had the mozzarella basil and it was melt in your mouth-I especially loved the red pepper aioli. 

You need to ask for Nicole to be your waitress-she is exceptional. 

The bad: nothing-you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This place makes a mean burger.  There are a ton to choose from, too.  They put all kinds of different sauces on them, which I appreciate as a real sauce-guy.  You really can't go wrong, I've been here a few times and had a tasty burger every single time.  If you're in Madison and love burgers, you gotta go here.

If you don't love burgers... you may still want to go here.  I recently tried the wings and cheese curds - both of which are pretty dang good.  The curds have a light batter to them.  Not quite Old Fashioned good, but definitely tasty.  Also, their chili was excellent and so were the chicken wings.  This place can do no wrong!"}
{"text":"At first I was kinda pissed that fries weren't included with a burger but then I reminded myself that the burgers cost 8-10 bucks not 12-14 and the fries are only 2 dollars. It's actually kind of nice for people like my mother who have smaller appetites and would rather steal a few from everybody else than get all her own and not be able to finish them

The melting pot burger is a meme, try something else. The onion rings are a must for me

It's more like 1.5 $ because you can just get a burger and get out of there for 10 bucks, though I will concede I never do"}
{"text":"Probably the best cheese curds in Madison. Very small but the breading was perfect. I ordered a burger and so did my friend. We both enjoyed our meals and had a great time. Our server was friendly and checked up on us regularly. We asked some questions about the food and she was very knowledgeable and happy to answer us. Kind of an older-looking place but it is well kept and nice."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here for the first time. Ditto to all the other great reviews. Very friendly staff. Sad waited on me. She was very attentive, without being overly bothersome. She offered to assist me with the menu, since I said I had never been here before. While I love the interesting menus, I ordered a build your own burger and just had an old school burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and extra raw onions. It was perfectly cooked to medium. Regular fries were hot and crispy. I got a side of the garlic sauce to have with the fries. Delicious! Will definitely come back. Very casual and interesting decor. Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious! Best burgers around!! The cheesecurds are perfection! I used to love Old Fashioned cheesecurds, but they are way too greasy. Dotty's curds are my new fav!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you a little tale of glory and hamburgers. I was confronted with a decision this evening to have a great burger or to tailgate a little league game with Alec Baldwin. So I chose the burger. I looked up a good burger in Wisconsin and it showed me to this gaping hole in the wall \"Dotty Dumpling Dowry\" but it should be called the ice box. It was so cold I was served ice cream even though I ordered hot cocoa. My nips were on mega blast this evening. I had a hard time ordering because my waitress could stop staring at the baby carrots I was smuggling under my shirt. Pack a jacket or at least skin a yak before you walk in. Anyways, the cheese curds were squeaky and good. I had the Melting Pot burger. That was some quality slaughtered beef. I mean it was juicy and had a great meaty slaughtered taste. The bun was soft and was on a mission to transport that slaughtered meat patty to my tooth garage. 

Top sum it all up. I think that we need to look at cars differently. They are just the craziest things ever. I mean, are they even organic?"}
{"text":"Great burgers and ambiance, but let down by soggy French fries, though a later lunch there (OK, I admit it, ti was the very next day!) had OK fries. Not great, but OK.
Bratwurst was also well worth a try."}
{"text":"We were driving from Minneapolis home to Chicago and wanted some place to eat that wasn't some fast food place along the highway. A quick google search for \"good burgers in Madison\" led us to this place. We loved it. Best cheese curds I've ever had, and my burger was really, really good. I'll make a point of stopping in next time I'm within 50 miles."}
{"text":"Good food but service has been a problem for me consistently over the last ten or so years. My first experience involved me ordering a burger well done, being served a rare burger, sending it back and saying, \"I don't mind if you put it in the microwave\" and being brought back a medium-rare burger, then giving up after eating the outer edges and not coming back for almost a decade. 

More recent visits have improved on the kitchen front - I dig their fries and usually opt for their staff favorite Green & Gold burger - cheddar, deep fried pickles, and bacon mayonnaise. A heart attack on a plate to be sure, but what a way to go. 

The service, though, continues to be lackluster. We've been left for an entire meal without anyone checking on us and having to literally get up and walk to the host station to get someone to bring us a bill, we've had servers that seem distracted and like we're a burden for placing an order, and on one occasion had a server that couldn't be bothered to check on us but could stand next to our table talking to another server for a good ten minutes. Oy. 

We don't go often so when the mood strikes us I'm usually willing to overlook past service and hope for better. No luck so far, but I'm holding out hope we'll get someone who enjoys their job eventually."}
{"text":"Our daughters loved Dotty's so much they requested to eat here twice on our trip to Madison! Loved it! Can't wait to go back one day!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a weekday. The service was good. The burgers were huge and delicious. The fries were hot and fresh. I had an iced tea the server kept full. We didn't have a wait before being seated. The server was very friendly. I liked the decor and atmosphere."}
{"text":"First visit was last night.  Why did I wait so long to find this place?  Burgers are made the way the are supposed to be....truly.  Very good service and ambience."}
{"text":"I think this was the fastest I've ever ate a hamburger in my entire life. And was the greatest tasting, which begs the udder question:

HOW DO YOU RAISE YOUR COWS OUT THERE IN WISCONSIN?!"}
{"text":"Almost 5 stars, but the service was spotty. 

Ok our food was delicious from start to finish. As others have noted, the cheese curds are outstanding, not greasy like most places. The wings were also excellent, big and plump. 

The burgers of course were fantastic, each of the 4 of us tried a different one and they were all great, not a morsel left by the end of the meal, and we were stuffed and happy. 

Go here."}
{"text":"Great burgers. I feel like a great burger requires two things: for the actual patty to be tasty and cooked appropriately, and for the variations on the general burger to be interesting. The patties are fantastic at Dotty Dumplings-- theyre not too heaped up and the mediums are cooked pink and warm in the center. The variations are also fantastic: the Heart Throb is my favorite but there are a number of other interesting options as well. Fries are delicious, fried mac and cheese also great. Haven't tried the curds (I feel like I'm missing out).

And the ambiance is easy going and friendly. Overall, I'm a fan. A definitely solid spot to grab a burger when youre in the peri-downtown area."}
{"text":"I remember my burger being better. 

Picture this: it's 200x and my first visit to DDD. Old college classmate (she was like 2 years ahead of me) led me here. It was more impressive to find an alum from my school at this place, UW so I trusted she knew the what what. 

Well, then...the burger was everything I desired. SLOPPY, BIG, JUICY AND FLAVORFUL. 
Yesterday, the Melting Pot was just \"Eh\" ala  The Simpsons. 
The cheese hadn't really melted on top. 
The meat was prepared just right and I was scared to death that a WELL done patty would be burnt to a crisp. The server was a sweetheart that was just as nervous and offered to take it back if anything was wrong. NOPE! So those guys know what they're doing around the grill. 

The standard English Garlic was nuked in favor of my highly anticipated HEART THROB sauce. The man that came up with this ~ can come home with me :* Mwah!

We shared a fry. The deal of the day sound impressive which my colleague ordered and it's a FANTASTIC VALUE. A $10-12 burger+fries+drink for only $9.99. 

I forewarned him that I, as a lady, have proper dining manners BUT all would be foregone for this anticipated burger. He laughed and said he was about to tell me that because he was going to be embarrassed in front of me (then he blushed). ROTFL. 

Maybe I hyped this burger up too much. Maybe I couldn't recall that initial burger I had years ago - either way. It was fresh - kudos. 
Sauce was 4.25star worthy - would have gotten 5 stars if they glob it on there for me
Patty - 4 stars
Overall taste - 3 stars. 
Decor - remains the same but not a winning point to me - 2stars
Open Grill and visable to us all - 4 stars  ( I almost forgot that one)
Pricing + Comparison as soo many good burgers exist in madison and I don't mean Red Robin - 2 stars. 

My weighted overall response: 3 stars. This is a solid place. Decent appeal and service. Excellent possibilities but for this lady - yesterday was just \"ok.\""}
{"text":"This place a great burgers and their house made fried cheese curds were amazing. My only problem was that they forgot to put bacon on my friends chicken wrap. The server did go to the kitchen and get us a big handful after we told him, but the kitchen should not have made a mistake like that. Not when you're paying over $10 for a sandwich. 

I will still go back and give them another chance. Please just don't forget something next time."}
{"text":"I decided to try out Dotty Dumpling's Dowry because I was told they had good burgers and who am I kidding - I like good burgers.  I got the Melting Pot Burger.  Wasn't great as everyone raved....so I was a bit disappointed given the hype about this place and their burgers.  The only thing I enjoyed was a side of cheese curds. Not sure if I will be returning next time I am in Madison."}
{"text":"This is my second trip here...amazing burgers!   The quality and the toppings are so good.  I love my business trips to Madison. 

Outside you will find an ordinary building (nothing special) with a line waiting outside...but inside it is a beautiful bar and restuarant.  If you are by yourself, then go past the line and squeeze in at the bar.  Don't ask the last guy in line outside because he never knows anything.  Those are words to live by!!!

Today I built my own burger and I was so happy...perfectly cooked medium rare...if you serve burgers you need to make sure they are not over cooked and this place does an amazing job.  

Great micro brews on tap.  Happy Hour also rocks...half off all tap beer from 4-6pm but I've never had the chance to enjoy it because I'm usually working at that time.  Makes me sad I'm paying full price right now. 

When in Madison, I highly recommend this place for some burgers and Beer.  The Onion Rings are also good too!!!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, great curds and fried pickles, lots of retro and classic drink options. Close to the Kohl Center, so expect long waits and slow service after game days or for weekend dinners. Nonetheless, it's a good stop for a quick bite to eat for the family and a classic Wisconsin food experience."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Fun atmosphere.  Every time I have been here I have enjoyed it. I take guests from out of town here because it's consistently excellent and they always love it.  Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Tried the melting pot burger and coleslaw. Burger was amazing. Highly recommend .  The coleslaw was creamy and awesome. 
Inside of restaurant was pretty interesting also. All together a great place."}
{"text":"The food is always good. The service is rough. We had a group of 9 and one burger was completely forgotten. Two burgers were undercooked. A soup never came. When we told our server that the burger was undercook she took it to have it remade. The manager (I'm assuming) brought it back two minutes later with her phone and turned the flashlight on to show us that the cook on the burger was correct. My friend still asked for it to be recooked because she felt that it was under. The entire table felt that it was rude the way the manager approached that situation. In the end, burgers and other items were comped and free pie was given which was nice but it wasn't enough. We will definitely be taking a break from Dotty's after this experience."}
{"text":"Yummy food! Mac and Cheese wedges accompanied with the Moon Man beer is an amazing combo! Their green and gold and runnelstone burgers were cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"Despite having \"dumpling\" in their name, they do not have dumplings on their menu and it's really quite confusing for people who have never been there. However, they have a drool-worthy menu full of burgers.

Aside from the sign informing patrons that they are discouraged to stay for more than an hour when it's busy, I had a great time at DDD. The service was really on point because I went there with my boyfriend on Badger game day. I had the Runnelstone and he had the Toadstool. We also ordered a basket of fries. I wanted my burger medium rare with raw onions instead of grilled and that is exactly what I got. It was delicious and aside from the bun feeling a little flimsy was exactly everything I look for in a burger. Juicy, flavorful patty with slightly melted cheese and plenty of onion. The fries were also perfect. Slight crisp on the outside with just the right amount of salt. 

I am totally in love with their burgers and might try to eat my way through their menu. Wish me luck."}
{"text":"Last Saturday was the only time in my life when I used the word \"F**K\" and \"Dumplings\" in the same sentence(As in \"F**K no I do not want to go to Dotty Dumpling's\").  My ever observant companions  took that as a definite NO and fortunately we went elsewhere.

Is it just me? Do I not know what a good burger tastes like or what good service consists of? After reading the good reviews here  guess I don't but the two times I have been there in three years I have had the most greasy, overpriced burgers accompanied by slow, indifferent service I have ever had.  I ordered a medium-rare and got a bloody, greasy glob that pretty much dissolved the bun. The meat was tasteless and the only thing that saved it was the sauce. Oh, and it took a mere forty-five minutes to get to me. The first visit wasn't much better.
 I think though that it may have something to do with going there on Sunday nights which can be a crap-shoot at any restaurant in Madison. Maybe I'll try it again on a weekday but since I had one of  the worst meals of my LIFE at this place I'm not eager to test my luck again.
If you have to go, stick to the fried mushrooms."}
{"text":"Highlights of a weekday lunch were the delicious, house-made veggie burger, the offering of local brews and spirits and the quick service at the bar.  I hadn't been here in years and was a bit surprised at the high prices on the menu - especially since none of the burgers/sammies include a side; fries, etc are an extra cost. A regular order of fries is enough (but just barely) for two people.  And food is served in baskets which made eating kind of awkward."}
{"text":"Great burgers and tasty beers on the menu here. A Madison staple. Get the English Garlic sauce on the side for dipping those awesome cheese curds - they are the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This is an always busy burger joint.  They have almost every kind of burger (even something for vegetarians and vegans)  I've never had something that I haven't liked from here.  The atmosphere is great, the servers are wonderful, and they have the best cheese curds ever!  However, on game days they are extremely busy and will encourage you to leave as soon as you are done with your meal."}
{"text":"Well, at the risk of sounding average, I'm rating this place the average of all 375 reviews. I really enjoyed my meal. Greeted immediately when I walked in, and seated right away. Server very nice and attentive. Onion rings good, not great (I prefer very light breeding). Fries decent. Burger was terrific. Cooked just like menu described. Good micro-brew list on tap. I wouldn't hesitate to return when in Madison, or suggest to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is legit!  The burgers are fresh and perfectly grilled.  Add the cheese curds and a selection of their local beer you can't go wrong!   Kayla is a great bartender too! Defiantly a place you should check out if you're looking for a place to grab some dinner.  The staff was awesome and the food matched! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here, I didn't think it was anything special, but it really depends on the burger you buy.  I love the Melting Pot burger.  They also recently changed the menu so you can pick whatever toppings you want on the burger.  Burgers are cooked perfectly and are huge/filling.  Just know that the wait is really long whenever there's an event at the Kohl Center."}
{"text":"I had to check out a rumor which is why I chose this place.   Rumor was that this place had one of the best burgers in Winsconsin.  Being a burger affacionado, I had to put this claim to the test on my visit to Madison.  I will admit that the atmosphere is  a little weird.  Jazz standards and wooden booths say more steakhouse to me than burger joint.  Up until you see the menu, you almost feel underdressed in a T-Shirt and Jeans.

The food makes up for the confusion that goes on with the decor.   The cheese curds are a delightfully light and crisp.   The onion rings are thick and crisp and go nice with the slightly spicy sauce that accompaines them.  We even went so far as to try out a third side, the buffalo fries which is something so obvious of a  good idea that you wish you would have thought of it.  Of course you can put buffalo sauce on french fries.

The star of the show was the burger.   I went for the Melting Pot.  You can tell that tese people know what they're doing when it comes to burgers as the default cooking temperature for their burgers is a perfect medium.  This gives you a nice smoky char on the outside with a juicy interior.   The garlic sauce works with the three cheeses to create a perfect harmony.  Add in crispy bacon and you've got yourself a winner."}
{"text":"We went here after the Badger basketball game because of all of the good reviews on here and also because they were voted the 2nd best burgers in Madison, WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED!  Our party of 4 each ordered a different burger and a basket of fries and not one of us complained about the burger.  They were soooooooo messy and gooey and delicious!  We are fans and will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great burger!  We travel all over and love burgers. We rate them on  a scale of 1-10.  This place is a solid 9.  Can't really think of a place we've been with a better tasting burger.  Darn near perfect burger.  Fries were okay. Great atmosphere love the collection."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Cora was excellent behind the bar
Bison Burger could've been a bit thicker."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed by my first Dotty's experience. I ordered the California burger and while the burger itself was juicy and tasty, the toppings that came on it were bland. The guacamole tasted and looked  like it had been made days earlier, and it had almost a sour taste. The cheese on the burger also wasn't melted, and the bun was so-so. Sweet potato fries were amazing, and I'm hoping that maybe I just got a bad burger, which I'm sure happens every once in a while. I will definitely be back though in hopes that it will live up to the hype that EVERYONE I know raves about!"}
{"text":"Dotty Dumpling's has been getting better and better over the past few years. I didn't have a lot whole to complain about for my last review, and I have even less now. Dotty Dumplings' burgers are good stuff.

Their burgers are always flavorful, whether it's a Melting Pot, with their amazing English garlic sauce and three cheeses or a build-your-own, which my husband usually gets with cheddar and bacon. What I started to do on my last few visits was order a build-your-own with muenster cheese and then put into my burger cheese curds, onion rings, and English garlic sauce from the sampler basket. I love the combination of flavors and textures in their burgers: juicy beef patty; creamy cheese; garlicky bite of the sauce; crisp lettuce, tomato, and pickle; and a soft bun to absorb all of the juices and sauces. But you can get amazing textures and flavors from their signature burgers as well--if you want the cooks to do the burger assembling for you my favorite is the Boomerang, though I discovered the Toadstool on my last visit was crazy delicious. It's hard to beat the prices of their burgers for the quality that you get, too.

Dotty Dumpling's has been getting more and more kid friendly over the years, too. They added a kids menu 3-4 years ago and put their kids drinks in a plastic cup you can take home. On a few occasions when we've mentioned that our kids were splitting one kids meal they have split it for us and put their meals in separate baskets.

And let me say, I love the decor and feel of the place. My kids adore the model airplanes and I like the dark tavern-feel and the black and white movies--they provide a little entertainment but they aren't overstimulating like football games or even home improvement shows and don't take my attention away from my food nor my company.

Dotty Dumpling's continues to prove that they take pride in their burgers and in providing an excellent experience for their diners."}
{"text":"My first time here I wasn't blow away, but I was pleasantly content. After reading the reviews I was compelled to try it out. The atmosphere is like a dive bar with a touch of history, B&W programming on the TV, a plethora of beers on tap, and a selection of burgers that will make you scratch your head. 

I had the Grand Daddy burger with fries and it was cooked excellent and was actually a really big burger.  Basically coming out of the edges of the bun, slathered with gooey cheese and the garlic sauce added the perfect balance. The fries were good and there was an adequate quantity. 

Overall a good burger, not the best I have ever had, but maybe the 2nd best in Madison after Graze. Would like to try other burger options with a beer next I am there at night."}
{"text":"Amazing went here 2x in the span of two days. The staff was so nice and attentive, I'm big on customer service. The burgers are EVERYTHING, you can tell the beef is fresh, fun fact about this place is they have their own sauces and I tried one out and it was AMAZING. I also got the sampler under the appetizers, it included fried macaroni balls..... like what else do I need to say about those. they were next level. Really cute set up and you can tell it is a local favorite as it was packed when I arrived and the wait only got longer later into dinner time. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Finally went and was not disappointed.

The burgers are very good - juicy and flavorful. I got the one with all the different kinds of cheese (I forgot the name) and it was delicious. The cheese curds were also fantastic - gooey, not overly battered and up there with some of my faves.

The atmosphere was nice, kind of reminded me of Avenue Bar or something. Really nice waitress who knew we were in a rush and was very accommodating.

There are other interesting looking menu items but sadly I feel like it's sacrilegious to come and not get a burger, so I may never try one..."}
{"text":"My buddies and I were passing thru Madison on our way to the Dells and a friend recommended this place so we decided to stop for lunch in this awesome college town. This place is so cool, nice vintage woodworks throughout gives its a turn of the century, Prohibition era vibe. They were even playing old black and white movies on the TV which I thought was so cool, then they started showing girls Wisconsin volleyball which was hot too LOL... anyways we ordered some beers from the awesome tap selection, my friend had one of the $10 cocktails, it was good but he thought it was too much $ it was worth a $7-8 dollars, maybe...  The food was amazing. We had the sample basket with fried mushrooms, onion rings, cheese curds, french fries and fried mac n cheese bites. Good fried stuff for sure. Get the English garlic mayo or the boomerang sauce, great stuff! We all had burgers, I had the Pub burger it was awesome with like an onion bacon jam and cheese and pickles... so delicious. Had it medium rare and it was just delicious. My buddies had the kobe burger, forgot the name but that was excellent too. That burger was like $12 mine was $8... totally on point with price. But you have to pay extra for sides which is dumb. I mean they make a killing at bar do you really have to charge for fries?? We also has the chili... mine with cheese melted on top and sprinkled with onions and sour cream... sooooo goood! It was the best chili I had in a long time. Its got tri-tip meat, oh my sooo gooood. A few of us thought it could have a little more kick'n heat to it but if you enjoy chili, you will walk away saying you loved it. I highly recommend it, especially during the cold winter months! Being from Chicago, there are no shortage of great places to eat but being out in Madison - this place is a must try!! Highly recommended and we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Solid place to grab a burger and a beer.  The cheese curds are awesome, lightly fried, fresh tasting, crunch on the outside, melty on the inside....mmmmm....you can easily share a small order of fries because they serve it in a massive basket.  Burgers are definitely messy, so it's certainly not a first date kind of place.  The beer selection is also pretty good.....try out the moose drool, which is far tastier than it sounds.  The ambiance isn't too bad either, with some interesting plane props, old classic movies on the mounted screens, and dimly lit, low hanging lights.  Solid."}
{"text":"This bar is in the heart of Madison's college campus and was extremely accommodating. As a vegetarian, I'm always leery on the flavor and value for veggie options at a bar, especially in the Midwest but Dotty didn't disappoint. We shared the local beer flights, Wisconsin cheese curds and a veggie burger (you can customize any of the burgers with a veggie patty) and it was delicious!! The service was so friendly and allowed us to mix and match our tastings to our preferences. The ambiance and decor of this place was cozy and perfect for families, dates or some solo game viewing. I'll definitely be back for my next cheese curd and spotted cow craving!"}
{"text":"This is my favoritest place in Madison 2 get a burger....the choice of burgers they have is just awesome....and their chili cheese fries are just to die for.

The only flip side is the location.....i mean it's a great location...but that's just the problem! Parking can be hard to come by.....it's really close to the Kohl Center so if u r going there on a game-night...well, good luck getting a table...also, they have a limited menu on such nights...which sucks, given the great options they have on regular days.

But then the atmosphere is always great...game-night or not!"}
{"text":"While walking around Madison and checking yelp for nearby spots, I found this place.  Its a great old school pub with old school wood and charm.  Since I was in Wisconsin i ordered the cheese curds to start, and then I got the California burger. I decided I'm not a fan of cheese curds. They are basically deep fried white cheddar balls. My burger was great and came with provolone cheese, smoked bacon, and avocado. There were lots of fun burgers on the menu and I had a hard time choosing what to get.

I'd recommend this place to anyone and stop by again my next time in Madison."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place for burgers in Madison.  A bit pricier than most burger joints but the atmosphere is a little nicer considering it's still a downtown bar/burger joint.  

TVs are good for game day.  I love that they put malt vinegar at the tables.  My son loves their cheese curds."}
{"text":"Solid burgers and good cheese curds.  Better than expected.  Service was quick and friendly even though it was a busy night."}
{"text":"Don't question this burger joint, just drop in.

I spent a weekend in Madison hitting as many food spots possible and Dotty's was a fun stop. Just a cool little place with friendly service, great food, and excellent drinks. We had fried pickles and cheese curds for starters, I had the Heart Throb, a beer as well as a bloody mary with a beer back. Our waitress was really helpful in getting our bloodies the way we liked them and recommending good local brews.

I have high standards for burgers so if I rate this 4 stars and would return then it must be good."}
{"text":"Really good burgers. I had the Green and Gold. The bacon mayo on there was great. Hubby and I shared an order of cheese curds that were tasty. FYI, burgers do not come with fries except for the special. 

Good craft beer selection, some wines, and the cocktail menu looked good. Not a huge fan of frosty glasses for craft beer, but it wasn't so bad that there was an iceberg floating in my beer or anything. 

Atmosphere was great. Oldies playing. Singing in the Rain was on the TV. Cool decor. 

I would definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"Burgers were great - I had the basil & Mozarella with extra fried onions. The thing was greasy and tough to pick up but really tasty.

Atmosphere is great - a bit loud when sports are on. 

Beers: Oh my gosh - loads of beers from Europe and regionally on Tap."}
{"text":"Nice burgers! Good and sloppy the way it should be! A bit too dim for me, food's a tad expensive for sure, but I go back because it's still so good!

The service is always so nice, too, so I can't give this anything less than four stars! Please go on my behalf!"}
{"text":"Back in the 90's I heard so many good things about this restaurant, but had yet to try it. On the back wall (by the restrooms) are a plethora of awards touting this joint as the 'Best Burger Place'. 

I came back to Madison for a visit this past weekend and made a stop to finally check out the hullabaloo.
It was around 2 p.m. and the hostess didn't even give us a 'hello' or any type of a greeting except \"do you need a booster seat?\"...not even eye contact.....and I gave her a kind 'hello' to begin with. Not like one of us didn't put for the effort.

Service was marginal. Not slow, but not quick either considering it wasn't that busy. Felt like we were interrupting. Like perhaps we were already after the lunch rush and what were we doing here?...It's time for the wait staff to rest of course. 
Asked for what I thought was a basic topping on a burger and got a chuckle out of the server \"No, we don't serve THAT here'. 
Huh. okay. Glad I gave you a good laugh...but just an FYI Dotty, Great Dane does provide that topping. 

Had the minestrone soup, California burger and side of fries (you have to order fries separately.....they didn't come with the expensive burger). 

Soup was okay. Hearty and reasonably good flavor. Nothing special.
Burger was a HUGE disappointment. Flavorless and SMALL...looked like a kids burger. Unimpressive bun even.
Fries were basic. 
They actually charged us $.75 for a serving of ranch dressing! Everything was ala carte at this place I guess. Glad I didn't order extra napkins. I'd be broke!

As comparison, I recently had a Great Dane burger and let me tell you, now that is a GOOD burger!

Got a diet Sprite that needed 'changing'....waaay bitter. I realize that happens, but just was the icing on the cake of disappointment. 

I'd likely not return. Poor service, poorer burger."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. While there are a number of specialty burgers available, the \"build your burger\" option seems like a good one to me. A wide variety of toppings are free of charge (standard lettuce, tomato, pickles, condiments, but also things that other places charge extra for - raw onions, grilled onions, a couple of kind of peppers), and another set of toppings is $0.75 each (bacon, blue cheese, guacamole, their sauces), which I thought was pretty good. Most importantly, though, the hamburger itself was great - a little crisp on the outside and pink in the middle (we asked for medium). The beer selection was pretty good and they were fairly quick with refills. Knocking down a star because the fries were fine but nothing special. A regular size was enough to share. We came a little after noon which was the height of the lunch crowd on a weekday but were seated after about ten minutes, which didn't seem too bad."}
{"text":"Oh how inconsistent you are. Great service and food one month. Then complete opposite the next. Its OK to have lower service standards, but at least keep the food as great as you have for these so many years."}
{"text":"Burger heaven on earth! I had wanted to try Dotty's for years and finally made it this visit to Madison. The atmosphere was eclectic, with an interesting collection of varied memorabilia. Although our server was great, I wish he knew a bit about the various items on the walls and ceiling, as I was curious. 

But I digress, as the star of the show at Dotty's is clearly the burgers, and justifiably so. My Heart Throb burger was awesome and the Black and Blue burgers others had were equally good. Comments on the fried cheese curds were \"best ever\". The French fries were fine, but nothing special. They have an awesome list of local and regional craft beers, as well as cocktails. 

Prices are surprisingly moderate for such high quality, but keep in mind that burgers are served solo; add-ons are a la carte. Having been to Dotty's only once before, way back in the beginning, I'm once again hooked."}
{"text":"Best burger in Madison. I honestly don't think anywhere else even compares. Keep doing what you guys are doing, aka making superb burgers."}
{"text":"I can tell you right now that their deep fried macaroni and cheese is battered heaven.  I highly recommend getting the sampler basket that has a whole cornucopia of deep fried tasties. (cheese curds, onion rings, mushrooms, mac and cheese, and fries) This place (obviously) is known for it's burgers so it doesn't really work well with my anti-red meat stance.  The veggie burger is okay and the salads are always crisp and fresh. My tuna steak sandwich was so so.  Also, do not go to Dotty's if time is a factor in your dining decisions.  Even during lunch Dotty's service is notoriously slow, day jobbers will never make it back to work in 45 minutes or less. (I suggest calling in your food ahead of time.) The reason why I do keep coming back here is that my dining companions love it, their beer selection is WONDERFUL, and I do not even know how to begin to deep fry my own macaroni and cheese."}
{"text":"I visited this place with my GF recently. I live in the DC/Baltimore region and we have our fair share of hamburger beer type places (brewer's art in Baltimore is amazing for example) but this place blew them all away.

Despite it being busy we got GREAT service, attentive waitress. The hamburgers were mind-blowingly good, extremely fairly priced and with 30 beers on tap the choices for what to wash it down with were endless.

Don't forget to order fried cheese curds!"}
{"text":"Visited Dotty's for the first time yesterday. I had their Toadstool burger with a veggie patty and it was AMAZING. I always try to find local places when visiting other towns and I was not disappointed with this one! Our waitress (Paige) was extremely attentive and friendly. This is definitely a gem!"}
{"text":"The best hamburger and cheese curds I have had. Had the melting pot burger and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit here.  I have to say, the food is really good.  My friends ordered onion rings and they were delish!  EXACTLY how onion rings should be made!  I ordered the spicy black bean veggie burger and fries.  The veggie burger is a must to eat whether you are vegetarian or not.  Spicy but not too spicy.  The fries were good.  I ordered a side of ranch dressing and it was also exactly how ranch should taste.  Very fresh!

Any downsides?  The burger was messy.  Not just mine but 2 others at my table ordered the veggie burger and it was hard to handle and drippy.  One of my friends wound up asking for a fork to eat their sandwich.  And the service I found was a bit lacking.  I practically  had to send up flares to get a refill on my iced tea.    They weren't busy so she should have been more attentive.  

Will I be back?  Absolutely.  The food is good and so is the atmosphere.  I like the fact it is local and small in comparison to other restaurants.  I hate feeling like I am drowning in a sea of patrons.

What do I find a bit ironic about this place?  The name Dotty 'Dumpling's' Dowry.  There isn't anything related to a dumpling on the menu.  Maybe that is something the owner and/or head chef can think about in the future..."}
{"text":"Mediocre day at what is probably a good place, a pub with a really good menu.

I started with the Chili.. when you say it's \"award winning\" that sets up some expectations.. so I got a bowl.. topped it with cheese and some sour cream.

Horrified, I almost ran from the place screaming.. they put MUSHROOMS in the chili! Who does that and why don't they warn you? I despise the funghi! It's not my fault, I've tried. They took away my almost full bowl, I moaned about the shrooms (got a shrug and a \"sorry\") and I paid for it anyway. Yuck.

We also shared some Mac and Cheese wedge's that were good.

OK.. let's move on... Madison is the State Capitol of Wisconsin...but we stopped there because it's a college town and we were on our way back from visiting family in Minnesota.  College towns have cool stuff and Madison is certainly pretty cool. It's Saturday and we aren't really thinking about it... but red shirts are everywhere... Oh yeah.. the University of Wisconsin Badgers! They have a home game so most people are at the game and not at Dotty Dumpling's Dowry (whew!) But they were losing 14-0 to the Minnesota Golden Gopher's.. the mood at Dotty Dumpling's Dowry decidedly displayed dismay. (Badgers went on to win later) 

I think the cook was definitely distracted, I know the server was.

\"The burgers will be pink inside\" Says it on the menu and she repeated it to each of us... They came well done. When I say well done; I don't mean that they did them well.. they was no hint of pink anywhere. That kind of sucks when you've got an $11 Grand Daddy Kobe beef burger or a $9 Buffalo Burger (Bison). So while the burgers had potential... they lacked in execution.

To complete the picture.. the burgers max out at 6 oz of meat and are served ala carte, so the pricing is really stiff for less than perfect. We all ordered fries and my son Ian got the Garlic Mayo for his fries (.75 upgrade)

I will say that the Heart Throb Sauce that I got on my burger was delicious!

No stars taken away because of the mushrooms.. there are obviously some misguided souls that think that's OK."}
{"text":"Dottys is excellent.
Fantastic service (frosted water glass) and delicious burgers. Id give it five stars if I had tried more items from the menu.
Warm ambiance.
Easy menu.
Just a good solid burger. I had the Gold and Green on a bed of lettuce and John had the pesto-y hot one. Both delicious! 
Try the bacon mayo. 
To note: every butger can be on lettuce for $1 more.
We will be back!"}
{"text":"Very good burgers and cheese curds! Here for a weekend trip and absolutely loved this spot! The booths were very cozy. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant.  I've been there twice and it was great both times.  In fact, on my last visit we actually planned on eating at a different place down the road which I hear has a great burger.  We sat down, had a beer, and decided to head over to The Dowry to eat instead."}
{"text":"Great place with a great vibe. Food was just what I was looking for. If you have the chance to get Haris as your waiter you won't be disappointed! He helped me with choosing just what I was looking for and seemed happy to help! Definitely recommending to friends!"}
{"text":"A la carte 6 oz. burgers for $8-12 in WISCONSIN should pack a punch. At Dotty's, it didn't. The \"pink on inside unless otherwise requested\" is a joke. I ordered med well black and blue burger and it came well done. Also, aside from the blue cheese, the burger itself was flavorless. The shakes and malts are $6, which I believe is expensive. The shake was mediocre, not memorable. I wanted I love this place but couldn't. I'm surprised this place is known for their burgers."}
{"text":"Burgers are good.  Service is very slow.  Two for Tuesday burgers are very small - its almost not a deal.  Eh."}
{"text":"We were in search for some good burgers and cheese curds ,  and we found it here.  From the hostess to the manager,  the customer service was outstanding. The manager not only checked on us,  but handwrote a list of the best places to get cheeses locally. My husband had 2 beers, and loved them both.  They also give you samples of their beer if  you want it before you order.  The kids all got free ice cream sandwiches after the meal. 

The burgers were good, but the toppings are what made them fantastic.  And the cheese curds? OMG.  Wonderful. Served with homemade ranch. 

One order of family size fries can easily feed 4-6 people. 

Must eat here!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Madison!  

Have been here several times and have absolutely loved it every single time.  The waitstaff is friendly, the environment is relaxed and they have a great beer selection with staff who are knowledgable about the beers.  

Even though they don't take reservations the wait is never too long, even on the weekends.  If you truly want to avoid waiting, anytime after 8:30 is probably safe to get you seated right away.

High recommendations for anything with the English garlic sauce, but especially the Melting Pot Burger (you might need a fork & knife to tackle this one).  Cheese curds are also wonderful.  Also if you're not loading up on drinks the meal is cheap! Went with a friend recently -we both got burgers and split the cheese curds and it came out to $10 a person!

Have to limit myself to only eating here once every month or two because it is completely against my diet.  However, when I do break the diet and eat at Dotty's it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Madison. Be sure to ask for lettuce, tomato, and onion otherwise it'll be plain (but still delicious)"}
{"text":"Dotty's deserves all the hype that it receives. We enjoyed two of the best burgers you will ever find and equally delicious cheese curds - and this is coming from a guy who doesn't typically like curds.

The only cons I could ever offer are that the restaurant is small in size and in a prime location so the wait can be long (but worth it). Also, I love darker spaces when it comes to eating but I can see some finding it too dark.

If you haven't tried this gem, please do yourself a favor and do so soon."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and the food was good! 
I had the Cajun Chicken Sandwich (hold the tomato please haha) and my fiance did the build a burger. Both of us were totally satisfied with the food and the service.The menu has so many options, it was hard deciding what I wanted!  I would love to come back for dinner some time because it's a pretty cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Burgers are home cooked, ridiculous, beer choices are excellent,  not overly battered, awesome cheese curds.  Good background classic music, great staff.  Pure pleasure to visit.  In a downtown full of great choices, this is a laid back atmosphere standout that excels without trying hard.

{"text":"Sauces tasted great but burgers were burnt. Two in our party had stomach issues after eating there. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Nice rustic dark atmosphere, with good burgers and excellent chili. Prices are more than fair with adequate service."}
{"text":"Dotty's is the place I always go to when I'm craving a burger and I don't want to make it myself. I love Dotty's burgers, I love it they can make them exactly the way I would make it at home. The fries are outstanding and overall I just can't say enough about this burger. It truly is the best in the area."}
{"text":"Doty's is an excellent place for a burger and beer. This is not health food nor should it be! The burgers are the right ratio of fat to lean and cooked perfectly. The variety is amazing and I always find new things I want to try. 

The atmosphere is rich and Wisconsin with memorabilia from many WI cities. It can be hard to get a spot on the weekends but worth the wait. One of the best burgers in Madison without a doubt."}
{"text":"As always a great place for a burger. The food hasn't changed but the atmosphere isn't as good as their 2nd location."}
{"text":"Was passing through Madison when students were checking in for school and a young lady suggested this place for lunch. The burgers were fantastic. Tried cheese curds for the first time. The draft IPA was outstanding.  The waiter was terrific. But when I told one of the worlds foremost Sherlock Holmes scholars about this place and it's name, he couldn't find it. Don't know what that's about, but the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Solid burgers, good sides, and good service. Our server had great recommendations on beer and burgers, and she wasn't wrong. There are tons of options, and I sampled a little of everything our party ordered. I'd recommend ordering a burger medium, as specified on the menu, as it wasn't super thick, so it was still nice and juicy without being raw-ish. 
The Southwest is great, as is the Heart Throb. The cheese curds were great, even though they were served with boring ranch sauce (get one of their signature sauces instead), and the fried mushrooms were decent too.
I understand the place can get pretty busy, but we went on the night after Christmas and the entire downtown was dead. Lucky for us. Party of 8 seated immediately.
Next time I will order one of their shakes too."}
{"text":"The ability to cook a perfect burger is Dotty's.  I'm so tired of places that over-cook.  My medium rare bison burger was the epitome of perfection.   I cannot wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"This place has a great homey, family bar feel and to be honest, it exceeded my expectation. They had an extensive beer list and I was happy to see they had Spotted Cow on draft as I don't get it often as I live in Illinois. I ordered the Heart Throb burger which had pepperjack cheese, smoked bacon and the special heart throb sauce. It was spicy but oh so delicious. I love that there are so many burger options with different flavor combinations. The cheese curds were great as well, although there could have been more."}
{"text":"Not really into all the fried food, but the OSO Nitro is delicious and the service is pleasant. Would definitely go back with friends."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday at 12:30 with some friends and sat at the bar which was completely empty besides a few employees at the far end. Seemed like service would have been good but that was obviously too much to hope for. Bartender was female blondish hair early 20s and super rude, acted like she didn't have time for us. The food is always wonderful but I can get the same thing elsewhere and get good service on top of that. I won't be back and neither will my friends. I don't look for an obnoxious attitude when I go out to eat. In fact I avoid it at all cost."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Had the veggie burger, they hand make their patties and you can get the veggie patty on any original burger choice. I got the original veggie, but I'll definitely be going back to try their other options. The ranch was delicious, I dipped my fries. We also got another homemade honey mustard sauce with our cheese curds and that was delicious too! I saw a guy order an old fashioned down the bar from me and I thought that looks like a good old fashioned so of course I ordered one and I was not disappointed!! We were going to sit at a table, but because it was so busy we ended up getting seating  at the bar and sat there to eat instead and it was great! Will definitely go back! Cool atmosphere, definitely great wait staff and great WI bar and grill!"}
{"text":"The burgers live up to the hype, they are juicy and oh so delicious. The garlic sauce they put on them is also excellent, not too garlicky, but enough to taste. The have a great list of micro brewed beers on tap too."}
{"text":"We went up to Madison to see The Avengers with our daughter. It was the weekend they block off Mifflin for a (wait for it.....) .... yes... a BIG DRINKING PARTY! While it was fun to watch all the yunggins having a drunk-n-blast, it was nice to find a respite by dashing in to Dotty's for some quiet time, delicious burgers, and a beer.

Four of us got burgers... yum! The fifth, my daughter, is a veggie. She got a salad. Clearly she was not as excited as the rest of us. Her salad looked good, but typical. The burgers, on the other hand, are wonderful. You can pick from several toppings. All were sufficiently messy and dripped down our faces. They serve them in baskets which really doesn't work for a messy burger. 

They have a good beer selection (it is Madison, after all) and the staff was friendly. Maybe they just came from Mifflin?"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was delicious. Their mac and cheese bites were to die for! I wasn't a fan of the fried mushrooms but they weren't bad. Their burger was well cooked, juicy and flavorful. I had the sampler as an appetizer and it is A LOT of food! Definitely more food that's ACTUALLY shareable unlike a lot of places that give you like 4 pieces of it. Definitely will be going back in the future!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience at Dotty's.  Game day it can be tough to get seated but so is any other restaurant near the Kohl Center.  I usually go for one of their many tasty burgers.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Awesome burger place in downtown Madison. I had the Grand Daddy burger with house made English sauce. Very good and tasty burger made to perfection. Atmosphere was very crowded but it wasn't a problem for us. Kid friendly as well"}
{"text":"Best Burger in Madison.

When I'm in the mood for a real burger this is where I come. A basket do fries and one of their speciality burgers and I'm in food comatose.

If you're in downtown Madison and are going g to eat Bar food come here."}
{"text":"Just ate here for lunch and came away impressed. Had the Melting Pot burger which was cooked perfectly medium pink and was delicious.

We had cheese curds too which were also delicious but could have included a couple more curds for the price. 

I think the best thing about this place besides the delicious burger was the atmosphere. They keep the lights down and have a dim light at every table. They played great music on the speakers which included Michael Buble, Frank Sinatra, and other jazz music. Definitely felt cozy, especially on a cold day. I will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, so can't really speak for service. Amazed how busy this place was at 6:30 on a Monday night, but there was a constant stream of people. Enjoyed the wedge salad and would happily eat it again. Would choose a less busy time next time...whenever that is."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar to work and spend some free time on a weekday evening. The reason for the 5 stars is twofold: the cheese curds and the $2.50 Spotted Cow. That's all a Sconnie girl needs."}
{"text":"No news here, just a repeat of what everyone else has said.  On our way to Minneapolis for the 4th of July weekend, we noticed our route was putting us through Madison, WI.  The timing was perfect for dinner so we got off the highway and headed to downtown Madison.  Ashley found Dotty's (on Yelp of course!) and read me the reviews of other fellow Yelpers.  

Good burgers, huh?  We'll see about that.  Walking into Dotty's was like walking into a neighborhood bar.  UW sports memorabilia everywhere (which I didn't care for as I am a Hoosier alum), and friendly faces waiting to serve you.  

I had a tasty local beer and we ordered cheese curds for an appetizer.  Best curds I've ever had, and my wife said the same thing.  She is from WI so her opinion is worth more than mine!

The burger was legitimately one of the best I have ever eaten.  Chicago Yelpers: it reminded me of a Portillo's burger, but bigger and with higher quality beef.  So delicious.  I didn't want it to end...luckily, Ashley couldn't finish hers and I got a couple extra bites :)

The kids meal for our little one was good too.  It came with chicken fingers, fries, a Go-gurt, and a drink.  I wish there was a Dotty's closer to home, but if I'm ever in Madison again to watch IU kick UW's butt, I'll be sure to stop in for that ridiculously good burger again!"}
{"text":"Super amazing burgers. Lots of different specialty types. Sweet potato fries were amazing. The place was a little dark and had small tables but overall this is a great place to go if you love burgers"}
{"text":"This place can get busy. Especially before a game at the Kohl Center. Finally had a chance to visit Dotty's this past year on multiple occasions. We liked it that much to come back a few times.

Instead of coming before a game, we've tried to go right after or when it's not at busy. Great burger selection and you can share a side like a basket of fries. Definitely a place worth checking out if you like burgers."}
{"text":"This was one of our college hangouts when it was located on Regent Street, yeah, that was a long time ago.  We stopped for an early lunch while biking around town.

The great selection of burgers is a plus - I got the one with the english garlic sauce which was very good and it was perfectly medium rare.  I spotted the chili on the menu and remembered it was one of my favorite - I ordered a cup and the memories rushed back.  It was very good.

Our waitress was very friendly.  Will make sure to eat here again when we visit town next summer."}
{"text":"I just returned to Dotty's after a 15 year hiatus, and I'm happy to report that their burgers are still delicious as hell.

Great interior, great beer selection, and deliciously juicy burgers.  (My wife said hers was \"too juicy.\"  i think I may have to trade her in.)"}
{"text":"I love their burgers when you ask for them to be cooked medium well. Everything is home cooked. Great craft beer selection and a really nice down-to-earth feeling inside. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of Mad Town's oldest establishments, this is a go to before any Badger game at the Kohl Center.  Famous for their burgers, this dimly lit environment is full of warmth and great decor.  I really love all the fun stuff and Badger memorabilia they have on the walls.  

The bloody I had was delicious, check it out on instagram; #bloody_mad"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, friendly staff. Food and service were average. Not a place I would want to visit over and over again. We had heard so much about the place we were really excited to finally get there but it was nothing memorable. Just your regular run-of-the-mill Madison pub stuff."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST whenever I visit Madison. The burgers are amazing and I always get an order of cheese curds. I always rave to anyone I know about how much I love their food!"}
{"text":"25 micro brews on tap and the best burger I have ever had!  This is a must visit for anyone in Madison WI. Gotta luv college towns!"}
{"text":"\"Best burger in Madison:

HMMMMMMMMMMM

It was PACKED and crazy....but that was right AFTER we got seated! Make sure to come early if it's game day so you can get a seat. ;)

We have eaten enough in Madison to know that there are a few hidden gems that deserve to be recognized nationally. That being said when we heard that DDD's was voted the best like 100 years in a row we had to check it out. 

We ordered a burger each, jambalaya \"soup\" as an appetizer and a regular order of chili fries. 
First of all WOW the regular order of chili fries was humongous. That was really unexpected. It was also unexpected that it took so long to order and it  arrived ridiculously late. 
Secondly I had ordered the California burger and which was supposed to come with a whole bunch of toppings that sounded amazing on the menu but when I got it I literally had to remove the top bun to make sure that I got the right burger because I didn't taste half the toppings. 

I have been to \"gourmet\" burgers joints before and have loved every second of them. I however did not find justification in spending $8+ for a sliver of a burger with very dismal amount of toppings. (was that burger patty even 4 ounces??)"}
{"text":"When it's dinner time in Madison, your options are endless. My brother mentioned this place so we thought we would give it a try! Almost everything on their menu is made in house, including sauces and pickles.

Atmosphere:
The restaurant is very small with not much seating. It creates a very cozy, lively atmosphere but also not a great place for groups bigger than 4.

Food: 
We split an order of cheese curds, sweet potato fries, and regular fries.  The cheese curds were what you expect in Wisconsin. Gooey cheese and lightly battered. The French fries we average.  They didn't have much flavor to them. The sweet potato fries were my favorite. They were very crunchy and lightly fries. For the entree I split the wedge salad and the gambler burger with my dad. We paid extra for bacon on a wedge - which typically comes with bacon, and they were only a few crumbs. It was disappointing. Our gambler burger was tiny. The meat to bun ratio was basically only bun. The patty was the size of a culvers patty. Again our burger said it was \"loaded with bacon\" and there was only one strip. The burger didn't have much flavor and was very pricy given its size and the fact that it doesn't come with a side.

For dessert my brother had a vanilla malt. They use an old fashioned malt mixer when they make their malts. It was very good!"}
{"text":"Burgers Galore! Disclaimer: there are no dumplings here, but that's alright! They are the number one burger place for many reasons. My personal favorites are the Melting Pot and the Bayou. These perfectly pair with their deep fried cheese curds and their garlic ranch. If you're feeling adventurous, the Bison burger is the way to go! Awesome service, but if you're the impatient kind, give the Poutine a try while waiting. Pro tip: pair your burgers with a Wisco beer!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing Friday Fish Fry. Walleye was attractive and the fish itself satisfying but the breading was soggy and not particularly flavorful. Very good beer selection."}
{"text":"Best lamb burger ever, and definitely the best burger place in Madison. The cheese curds are amazing as well. Only two complains are that the restaurant is very dark and loud, and the drinks are a little overpriced. Still, I go there all the time because of the amazing food."}
{"text":"The host or the maybe she was the manager. When I walked in ask for table for 3. They were about to seat us on a high table. Then my mom walked behind me with her wallker and the manager came by talked to me asked me if I wont mind sitting in this half booth table. Which would work out better for my mom. There was a server that almost ran into my mom couple times. The manager or the host with the wonderful star wars shelve tattoo came by once my mom was seated. She asked if this table was better. We told her it was better. Then we told her about the waiter that almost ran into mom. She felt bad and she said she would talk to him and she offered free piece of pie. Thanks to the wonderful host or manager she help bring back loving this place. 
We order deep fried cheese curds. They were still squeaky. We also order Kobe beef upgrade. It was awesome suggestion to do. We are truly coming back this place. It was worth the trip to have a wonderful burger."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner during the Kentucky Derby. We've tried to go a few times only to be greeted by a 2 hour wait, so this time we went around 4pm.

The service is why you're losing 2 of the stars. First thing that was a red flag: I ordered a mint julep (in true Derby fashion), and the waitress said they couldn't make it unless I told them the ingredients. Really? A mint julep? I assured her that the bartender would know how to make a mint julep, but she was pretty curt, so I opted for a draft beer instead. Additionally, we only saw her every 10 minutes and couldn't find her when we needed something. Pretty poor overall.

The food and drinks were pretty good, but nothing like the other reviews claim. I got the spicy veggie burger (which WAS pretty spicy) and that was tasty. The fries were alright.

Dotty, you can do better. :-/"}
{"text":"I went to Madison last week and after reading good reviews on Yelp decided to stop at Dotty's for a burger. I ordered the Melting Pot and my boyfriend got the Heart Throb. Both burgers were absolutely delicious! The heart throb was spicy, but tolerable. And the melting pot was awesomely cheesey with a mayo-garlic sauce. I hate mayo, but this sauce was the boss. We also got cheese curds because of all the reviews about them on yelp, so yummy! The server was very sweet and the place had a great vibe.Overall  I loved it!
I will definitely go here again the next time I find myself in Madtown."}
{"text":"The burgers are great and cooked perfect. Good curds, average fries and wide beer selection. Chocolate milkshake was good, too. Must visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger in Madison. The food is complex yet simple. They start with a great base which is high quality meat. Then they get creative and add amazing flavor combinations to their burgers. There is nothing better than a burger from Dotty's on a game day, or on any other day of the week. The atmosphere is wonderful and you can't help but get into the Madison experience while eating there."}
{"text":"Came here in my search for the best fried cheese curds in Madison.  They did not disappoint, but weren't in my top thee places for cheese curds.  

The burgers were solid, though.  I'm dreaming about them at night.  

The service was good.  The decor was pleasant.  All in all, I will go back...but not with any urgency."}
{"text":"We chose the Aphrodite special and Rolls Royce burger. Blue Moon Belgium White Ale is delicious and Fat tire. Food was good. Service good. Ambiance here is always upbeat. Service is friendly and it's not too long to wait for the food. Usually busy here on game day!"}
{"text":"Simply some of the best burgers around. I have tried a number of the burgers on the menu, and they are always cooked as ordered and topped with all sorts of interesting toppings. You can always customize a burger with the various standard toppings (and the not-so-standard - garlic sauce? Yum!) or order one of the named concoctions right off the menu. The onion rings are better than average and don't usually fall apart on you (my pet peeve).

The staff is friendly, and the service prompt and relatively quick. You might have to wait a bit for a table and a slight bit for your food if the place is packed. That will happen before or after a Wisconsin Hockey or Basketball game or any other event held at the Kohl Center. Some friends and I always stop here before going to the State Basketball Championships, and we are usually glad we did."}
{"text":"Had a really good time at this place. The atmosphere was really cozy and inviting. The food was good but our server Haris was the best part! He was really attentive, always offering to move something out of our way or to get us another beer. His cheerful personality was really nice. He even gave us some good recommendations that worked out perfectly for both of us. 

Don't let these slightly unappetizing-looking burger fool you. This is a really nice spot!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love it here; it's one of our go-to date places! 

The first time we went, we both got \"Build Your Own Hamburgers,\" and shared sides of French fries and fried mushrooms. The burgers are pretty big, but really good, so it makes sense that it's what they're famous for. The sides were good, but it's worth noting that they aren't served with your burger or sandwich so you have to order them separately.

The second time I went I was with a couple girlfriends and I ordered the grilled cheese with deep fried pickles. In theory, the idea of that sounded amazing, but they also added a thick layer of some kind of tarter sauce which I wasn't expecting and wasn't a fan of. (Nothing against their tarter sauce, I just don't like it in general.) Luckily, I had also ordered a chocolate malt which was so incredible and totally saved the experience!

The third visit and all subsequent visits have been with my boyfriend. It was during the third visit that I tried the Deep Fried Cod Sandwich, and I have never turned back. It's so simple, but so delicious: just a piece of fried cod with lettuce and tomato on a light, fluffy bun. (I think it also comes with tarter sauce, but I ask them to leave that off.) My boyfriend continues to build his own burgers and we order a variety of sides to share, but usually the fries or cheese curds. (Or both!) And I usually try to find a way to justify getting their chocolate malt because it's just so amazing! I don't think I've had a better one anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Dote [doht]  
verb (used without object), dot*ed, dot*ing. Also, doat.
to bestow or express excessive love or fondness habitually (usually followed by on or upon): They dote on their youngest daughter. - thank you: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dote?s=t 

Yes. I dote on Dotty's. More specifically, I dote on the goodness that is Dotty's Melting Pot burger.

Maybe it's the trifecta of cheddar, swiss, and provolone cheese that I am infatuated with. 

Maybe it's the hefty slices of Jones Dairy Farm smoked bacon that I love.

But if I really must confess, I know that deep down, it's the signature, incredibly flavorful, English garlic sauce that I am unable to erase from my memory. The level of delicious already present in this great burger increases five-fold thanks to the mighty powers of this wonderful sauce. 

The burger is messy, but reasonably so. You'll be willing to get your hands (and face, and clothing) dirty in order to experience this #1 selling burger love."}
{"text":"YUM! My fiance and I stopped in Sunday afternoon to split a burger; we weren't that hungry, but wanted to try this place we had heard great things about before leaving Madison. We tried the #1 selling burger, The Melting Pot (3 cheeses with smoked bacon and garlic aioli) with fries and were not disappointed! The chef even cut our burger in half and sent it out in 2 baskets for us, what service! The burger was cooked a perfect medium and juicy - we loved it. I also enjoyed the malt vinegar at the table to add to my fries. Quick and friendly service, very affordable, and a playlist of mostly Beatles and Bowie, so it gets my seal of approval. We will definitely be back to try the Green and Gold burger next time we visit Madison."}
{"text":"Always a good atmosphere and especially good burgers at decent prices. Ask for their specials! The prices are decent too - typical of downtown Madison."}
{"text":"I won't ever get over the move from the old location, which I loved, but the new place is centrally located. I love Dotty's juicy burgers, and the numerous variations are really creative (my personal favorite is the Ceasar). My guy thinks they're too small. (He may have a point, but he could just get 2 of them). Anyway, they are grilled, not flame broiled, and are 6 oz, and I think that's pre-cooking (a warning in case like my guy you think all burgers should be in the 8+ oz range). The bun in unusual and not a traditional burger bun - it's that yellowish bread you sometimes see that can get a little soggy under the meat juices and sauces. 

The sides are great - I love any place with fried shrooms, and they have some of the best cheese curds I've had in Wisconsin - crisp, not at all greasy, and I think there's a touch of cornmeal in the batter. Fries are also good. I also appreciate a place that has malt vinegar on the tables, 'cause some of us really like that tang with our fried stuff. My kids LOVE the shakes, and they are really luscious. Waitstaff is always efficient, and even on the weekends, the wait for a table isn't forever. So it still is a favorite of mine - I just go without the boyfriend."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place.  I like the burger selections and they also have make your own as well.  Lamb burger is delicious as well.  The fries are fantastic and so are the fried mac & cheese bites.  Beer selection is solid.  If you want a burger in Madison, this is the place to go.  They cook all their burgers medium unless you tell them otherwise or a waitress asks."}
{"text":"This is a great place for no frills, just honest and SCRUMPTIOUS burgers! 
It's a dive in the true sense of the word (this should be on diners, drive-ins and dives!)

Super affordable (most burgers are under $9)

Great flavor profile (from traditional, to make your own and their premade combos- all are amazing! I had the hearthob- nice and spicy! Hubby had the English toadstool). they have really great sauces to accompany your burger and things to dip

Sides are all amazing and worth trying (onion rings are perfectly crunchy and panko crusted and their fries are prefectly crisp and skinny)

options for vegetarians and vegans (yay!)

This is a must do when in Madison (especially on a game day!)

I think the only thing I wasn't crazy about was the dessert- only one thing the homemade fudge bottom pie (I say skip it and go elsewhere) It's 75% whipped cream (unless you like whipped cream that much!)

Definitely would come back! This is great to go with other people and share a bunch of the sides

Service was great!"}
{"text":"Juicy burgers with a variety of different toppings. Impressive list of sauces for dipping their delicious French fries. My favorite burger joint in Madison!"}
{"text":"Busy place but still got a table relatively quickly, friendly service.  Tried the cheese curds since it is a Wisconsin specialty, super good with ranch sauce.  They are similar in concept to mozzarella sticks, except smaller, different batter, and cheese.  Had a customized burger (recommend skipping the cheese after having the curds) as well with their English garlic sauce, excellent."}
{"text":"Ideal lunch at Dotty's in downtown Madison: Spotted Cow with fried cheese curds (only in Wisconsin!) followed by English Garlic sauce burger with chili cheese fries.  After that, you might as well go home because you're certainly not getting anything done at the office anymore. Pretty good burgers (buns are too small), great tap beer selection, and fantastic chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"In a sea of red UW Madison t-shirt clad women servers DDD is as busy as can be and packed to the gills on a weekend night in Madison. Perfect mix of parents, visiting protesters, kids, and UW students. I have not been to Madison since I attended UW and all the giant tower private dorms crowd out the buildings near DDD so the neighborhood seems so odd these days. What's with these fancy \"private dorms\" .... really parents? Are you all totally nuts? What every happened to roughing it when in college? Rant rant. :) OK, my review.... 

So, Thank goodness this Madison institution still sells an amazing burger. I had the Heart Throb and my friend had the blue ribbon and what we got were two amazing burgers brought out quickly. The burgers were medium as we requested and the flavor and fries were perfect. All around an amazing burger, fun servers who were in a good mood and seemed to like to joke around with a couple of old geezers. There are some things that could be improved upon. 

Why not go a little more upscale and offer brie and blue cheese for a little more money? Also, I agree with Katy B that a fried egg on top option is now a must for a good burger place. Just a few tweaks and this place would be 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Any time we end up here, it's a result of desultoriness. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with this place. They have a great selection of burgers and other sandwiches, as well as fried offerings. It's just that somehow, we only go here when we don't know what else we should do. Had two beers on the Terrace? Getting out of a hockey game late? You're tired after a long day at school? Go to Dotty's! For all of these situations, this joint serves wonderfully. They could make it a bit brighter, though, I often feel like I'm about to pass out when I'm there!"}
{"text":"I got the Heart Throb burger with fries and cup of chili.  The chili wasn't my favorite, but wasn't that bad.  The burger was really good.  Cooked to medium with some pink the flavor was great."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great beer, and our waitress was cute..what more can you ask for??"}
