{"text":"I've only gone for lunch, which is very quiet at Olivor Twist.  Not many people in this place around noon.  My favorite dish there is the margherita pizza.  It is drizzled with balsamic vinegar, which I think is a nice touch.  Once in a while they will have a homemade peanut butter pie that is pretty delicious to top off your meal.  

The bar reminds me of an old-timey, very classy bar.  I have not had any drinks there since I have only gone on lunch breaks, but they seem to have a wide selection & fully stocked bar."}
{"text":"I went to Olivor Twist because I love to eat in downtown Willoughby, especially for Happy Hour.  I arrived at 5:15 pm on Friday evening and sat at the bar right across from the POS terminal.  There were several bartenders/servers in the area and one finally asked me if I would like a drink. I got a beer ($2.50 for Happy Hour) and asked if they had any food specials to which the waitress responded \"1/2 off pizza\" as she walked away.  

The beer was served cold and as expected. I then waited to get someone's attention for a food order.  Since no one wanted to take my order or offer me a menu, I looked on my phone at the online menu.  I decided to get the Pepperoni and Chorizo pizza ($5.00 for Happy Hour).  

As other online reviews have mentioned, the pizza is very disappointing.  They describe it as \"homemade\" on their website, but I am not sure if it is.  It really tasted like a frozen and reheated pizza, devoid of any real taste.

No one asked me if the pizza tasted good. No one offered me a menu or asked if I wanted to order more food. No one asked if I wanted another beer -- well, until i paid the check and was walking out the door. The staff stood around talking.  

My experience was really disappointing because I had heard good things about Olivor Twist.  Next time I want pizza and a beer, I will go to the Wild Goose down the street.  I will not return to Olivor Twist."}
{"text":"I had a quick lunch in here the other day. Burger with a side salad. The burger was cook very well and had a lot of flavor. The salad was also dressed really nicely. Think my meal was $10 with a $2 charge for the salad. In hindsight the salad may not have been worth the $2 up charge but it was a healthy choice at the time. 

It seem like they had a lot of nice specials going on during lunch and I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"We try and get out to Oliver Twist on a frequent basis. We have found the food to be very good and service very attentive.  We were out tonight and sat outside .  They had  entertainment  ( Steve Jochum) tonight who is wonderful to go listen to on a summer evening.  Our server Kristen was excellent.  The other server/bartender also checked on us, along with the manager.  My husband had the sausage stuffed peppers which were excellent.  I had the brisket burger which was cooked perfect.
We have never had a bad experience here, and if anyone has you need to give them another chance.."}
{"text":"I have been to O/T many time the food is excellent & the martini's even better.  It is my wife's and my favorite place.  In groups or with just to 2 of us.  It's not cheap, but you get more than what you pay for.  Thank you Olivor Twist for the special times my wife & I hae had there."}
{"text":"I am sad to have to write a bad review on Olivor Twist.  I have gone here for years.  The drinks are really good especially when Tim makes them, but alas, the food is poor to fair at best.  This is being said with many hits and misses over the years.  The icing on the cake was this past Wednesday when three of the four of us had to return our food, pizza-tasteless, mac and cheese-tasteless, well done hamburger, reddish pink...the EXACT SAME hamburger was returned to me, not even a fresh one was made...yuk!  \"Mr. Twist\" himself came to the table, we voiced our displeasure, he was flip and unapologetic.  We did get a free round of drinks, but come on...this was so substandard, it was laughable.  I will continue to come on some Wednesdays to see Steve Jochum but will definitely have eaten first.  What a shame!"}
{"text":"Came here on 'Ladies Night' not realizing it was and they had a 45 min wait for a table. It was cold and we didn't fancy prowling the streets of Willoughby looking for food so we propped ourselves at the bar, ordered a cocktail and a pizza for a starter. 

The pizzas aren't huge, but they come on a thick base. The pepperoni & italian sausage pizza was excellent (once we let it cool). When we were done, we didn't need a main (or a table) so stayed at the bar and ordered another cocktail and rather average cheese plate instead.  I'll need to go back to try the interesting looking entrees another time.

The food isn't bad, the ambiance is great, but it can get rowdy, but the best thing here are the martinis. Don't visit without trying them.

Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Have always loved Olivor Twist. Sat at the bar this time and enjoyed the sea scallops for dinner. This dish was seasoned, cooked, and presented perfectly. Compliments to the Chef. I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I cant say enough good things about this place! I have been coming here for well over  a year with my boyfriend. The first time we came was just to have a drink after we had  dinner across the street. As we sat at the bar we noticed all the lights go out at the restaurant we ate at. We realized our car keys were still there because we did valet. As we rushed to pay our tab and get to our car the server asked what was wrong. We explained our situation and before we knew it he was across the street knocking on the door! We got over and he was already in the restaurant explaining our situation! We got our keys and have been coming into Olivor Twist ever since. I actually called the management the next day to tell them how helpful he was, he really went out of his way. We love happy hour and the half price pizzas are awesome. By the way the servers name is Tim and he makes a mean martini!! All of the staff is friendly and I have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"It was a very great atmosphere. The food was great but the service was pretty slow. One of the better places in Downtown Willoughby."}
{"text":"Took my friend there to treat her and we ordered the Waldorf Salad, thinking fresh, crisp, filling. NOT.
The look of it was not what you would expect.  Gray soup mixture with cut up grapes, chicken. But the lettuce was BEAUTIFUL.

Food has to look good along with tasting good.  This salad misses the mark.


."}
{"text":"Excellent martinis. Always a favorite place. Unfortunately, they replaced their pepperoni and chorizo pizza with something less savory. Pizza was always ordered; sometimes a couple of them. Now, we won't be ordering it. Looking forward to them returning to the better pizza."}
{"text":"Olivor Twist (Olive or Twist!? - I love puns!) is a great little martini bar in Willoughby.  It's definitely a more sophisticated crowd, great for new dates or a girls martini night.  It is kind of a quiet atmosphere, but when I was there the Indian game was on the televisions.  
The martinis are actually really good and there was quite a long list available.  I probably would never find myself at Olivor Twist on a Friday or Saturday night because Willoughby has much more exciting venues, but a nice night-cap on a weekday will work!"}
{"text":"Any martini bar named so cleverly is a good place to go in my opinion.
and with a list that has enough to keep me happy, and it's little trendiness right smack dab in the middle of old fashioned \"main street usa\" kinda warms your heart.
and after a drink or two from these folks, the rest of you will be warm too."}
{"text":"We came here on a weeknight with a reservation. We were immediately met with some of the worst service I've ever experienced. The hostess was such a rude human being and definitely has no place in restaurants (if you must keep her, Olivor, send her to the kitchen to wash dishes or the basement to roll her eyes at the gremlins down there instead of your customers). I walked in and told her we had a reservation and gave her my last name. This was met with a deep sigh and \"OTHER name?!\" So I gave her my first name, she did a quick scan of the list and obviously didn't find what she was looking for. She then just rolled her eyes and marched us to a table--eye rolling?! Come on. Why would I MAKE UP a reservation in the not-so-crowded establishment in the first place? I would have gladly stood there and helped her figure out what the mix up was, but she wasn't having it. 

We waited a LONG time for our server and when he finally came, he mixed up a drink order. My dirty martini was pretty delicious, though, so I wasn't too upset. We then started seeing other tables around us getting bread baskets from the hostess and we did not. Our stomachs were growling audibly at this point, but luckily the whole place was pretty loud so we couldn't even hear them. When we finally got our drinks and food, we got a bread basket with it...I don't think that's how that is supposed to work, but oh well. 

Despite the horrible service and jerks working here, the food was amazing. The mussels were good, though not the best I've ever had. The scallop salad, though, was absolutely perfect. I wasn't expecting anything large, as those types of salads tend to come in dainty little packages, but the size was filling and the scallops were spot on. 

Lucky you, Olivor! The food alone brought the 1-star rating due to the crap service up to a 3 because I know I'll suffer through the humans here for another bite of the food. The whole front of the house needs restaffed and they'll be in much better shape."}
{"text":"I went to Olivor Twist merely to have a few drinks, and it is quite the classy joint.  I tried a few of the exotic martinis there, but there appears to be a pretty good beer and wine selection as well, and pretty attentive service while you're sitting at the bar.

It's a bit loud for conversation inside (might have just been where we were sitting and the crowdedness) and pricey for a night of bar hopping, but the bartenders keep the drinks flowing pretty well."}
{"text":"Came for lunch while here on business.  Very quiet at the time, and the interior was very nice.  Waitress was attentive and kept our drinks filled.  I was unimpressed by the sampling I had of my neighbor's special of the day (scallops with truffle aioli), but my french dip sandwich was stuffed with quality roast beef, and the herb butter and bread they give at the beginning was dangerously addicting.  Prices are a trifle high for lunch, but it was very nice experience."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Acoustic guy strumming guitar on a Wednesday night at a cool martini bar.  I'm in...  Impressive list of martinis and cheap!  Wow, only $8.50 for a martini with Van Gogh and a couple other good vodkas?  Pinch me.  The crab cake is absolutely DELICIOUS...best I've ever had.  It's prepared with a Sricha Honey Aioli and I don't know what it's sitting on but it's some time of perfectly seasoned slaw.  Wow, I just ate it last night and I'm still talking about it.  Cool bartenders.  A winner."}
{"text":"I come to Willoughby on business trips a couple times a year and this has to be my favorite restaurant on the strip. I've stayed in many of the surrounding communities (Mentor, Painesville, etc.) but nothing compares to the close proximity to great bars and restaurants that Willoughby has to offer.

I've eaten at Olivor Twist for the past 4 or 5 years and usually just sit at the bar. The bartenders have always been super friendly and attentive. They usually have specials on the menu and I've eaten everything from duck to pork chops to beef tartare. Being from LA, I'm obviously super picky when it comes to good quality food and Olivors has never failed to disappoint. They also have a great wine selection and great specials during the weeknights."}
{"text":"I like it.  I recently went here for happy hour (3-6 on weekdays).  Martinis were $5 each (regularly about $8).  I thought that was reasonably priced and I enjoyed the drinks.  The were not overpoweringly strong like most.  Food was good too.  We just got the apps."}
{"text":"The martinis are awesome! Best I ever had and a great place to come at night but wasn't that impressed with food. Pulled pork I've had much better the fries were perfect ally crispy though. We are on the patio which is small but a nice atmosphere. While we were out here though a man at the bar bonged a beer...."}
{"text":"Outstanding, such a great place
Service gets top marks. Martinis to die for, entrees that amaze
The owners ard nice too"}
{"text":"After a pre-Christmas dinner here, I left reminding myself that there are decent places to eat outside of the Tremont/Ohio City/Downtown hub.

This place has a very extensive martini list, and all priced at $9 (Where can you get one at that price on W. 25th or in Tremont? Seriously, if you know please respond). I had the Starburst (Vodka, watermelon liqueor, etc) which tasted like a Jolly Rancher in a good way; then the Raspbery Truffle (had four ingredients but the only one that mattered was chambord) which was amazing; and the Peanut Butter Cup (almost the same ingredients except peanut  butter sauce instead of chambord) which was decent.

While I would give the drinks 5 stars, I would probably give the food 3 stars. I had the lobster mac and cheese ($15) and it had a fair amount of lobster but overall was maybe a little too heavy, even for mac and cheese. Jeannene had the stuffed chicken ($18) which I tasted and thought it was OK but nothing to write home about (but enough to post in Yelp).

The atmosphere was very festive (i.e. loud) while the waitstaff came around often despite a packed room."}
{"text":"I came here all of the time. Most of the menu is delicious! I love the pizzas, about half of the salads, and the fillet minion is to die for! The desserts are so good and they always change so there's always something new to try.

The martinis are great. They aren't too strong or to weak- just right.

The servers are great. They're very attentive, friendly, happy, and overall wonderful.

The only issue I've ever had is that it gets packed on Saturday nights. The staff is still great, but it's too loud. It's not their fault that everyone loves them though."}
{"text":"Great place for a business lunch, dinner with friends or martinis! I recently had a business lunch here and was very impressed with the speed and quality of the dishes. They are obviously cognizant of the fact that many people only have an hour for lunch so getting the food to the table in a reasonable tim for the patron to enjoy is key, kudos! I enjoyed the scallop lunch with sweet potato hash and can safely safe it was one of the top 3 scallop dishes I have ever had. It was the perfect size for lunch and the perfect blend of well seasoned and perfectly cooked scallop with a bit of sweetness from the sweet potato hash. My dining companion had the soup of the day and Caesar salad, and complimented them on the fact that the romaine pieces were cut into perfect bite size pieces not the gigantic pieces that some places cut them into. The service was expedient and friendly, we never felt rushed but knew that when we wanted the check we wouldn't be waiting 10 minutes to flag down the server. I highly recommend the martinis as well, sadly I didn't have the luxury or enjoying one during my business lunch though. They used to have a Lychee-tini during the summertime that was out of this world refreshing and tropical tasting. The Peanut Butter Cuptini is the most amazing dessert martini I've ever had and the Pina Colada-tini is tropical, sweet and creamy! I will say that often times the bar can become quite busy on a Friday or Saturday night so don't expect to find seating at the bar anytime after 10pm unless your lucky!"}
{"text":"Seriously, if they would just do drinks, they'd be be better off. I've been here for drinks and they've been consistent. However, food is hit or miss.  I've been here where food has been good, but after tonight, they should really just stick to drinks.  I got the Almond Joy to drink, 2 thumbs up.  I got the fried calamari, and it had absolutely zero flavor.  I've had calamari at other places and it manages to be good without having to completely cover it in marinera sauce.  I also ordered the 4 cheese pizza and it reminded me of something I could have gotten from the store and made at home.  Wasn't really a fan.  The only reason 3 stars were given was because of the times I've gone for drinks."}
{"text":"My husband and I visit Oliver Twist on occasion for their happy hour- HAPPY indeed!  We usually aim for Thursday for their $5 pizza.  They DON'T skip simply because it is on special.  The staff is always very friendly and welcoming and the wine selection is respectable.   Certainly a nice place to go for a few drinks and a bite to eat.  :)"}
{"text":"Delicious ribs.  Both sweet and tangy at once. Only ribs better were my buddy Ricky's off his smoker. Went old school on drinks,  basic gin and vodka martinis - just wonderful.  First time here but definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Had a lunch meeting here yesterday and have a great experience.  The Pine Nut and Pear Salad was delicious and the service was quick.  We were in & out quickly."}
{"text":"We dined at Oliver Twist last night and really liked the new menu.  My husband got the duck and enjoyed it quite a bit and I got the scallop dinner.  My dinner tasted great but I was disappointed that there were only three scallops on the plate.  This seems quite skimpy for an entree.  I am also not a fan of cornbread when it is served in lieu of other breads before dinner.
All in all though, it seems to be going in the right direction."}
{"text":"The spelling of this business is actually OlivOR Twist. I lived across the street from it for about 4 years and looked at the sign daily. 

The food here is good. I've had a few things from the menu. What stood out to me were the pizzas. I went one night with some friends and we all got a different pizza and we liked all of them. There are some tasty appetizers too.

The drinks have always been decent. I'm not a huge fan of the girly types of martinis. If those are your thing, then this is your place. 

If you're not into large, OMGicannotmove, crowds then I'd say to visit during the week when it's quieter. Weekends are extremely crowded and this place has really bad acoustics - it gets REALLY loud in here and you cannot hear the person across the table from you - and it's not because the music is too loud. 

If it weren't for the acoustics and the crowds, I'd give this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"Reservations recommended on weekends.  We arrived early at about 5:30 on a Saturday and were surprised we would need reservations unless we sat outside on the back patio.  The patio was actually very nice and we had a great time.  Service was prompt and food was excellent.  The check was no more than I have paid many times at chain restaurants.  Overall a great local restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent place for martinis!  Big fan of the \"Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup\" Martini the most.  The \"Almond Joy\" is also very good."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while I was out of the office with a coworker. We were in the 'hood all day and she said that, a few miles over, Willoughby had a nice little downtown area. I'm not sure how all of the antique shops stay in business but Olivor Twist is an unexpected find in the area.

The food was good and the atmosphere was nice. Nice modern interior and service was pleasant. The food was above average but not 5 star.

They have a lunch menu but the portions are still very large and have prices to go with it.

I would definitely come back here again but I wouldn't drive all the way from Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is a great place for meeting, and dining right in beautiful downtown Willoughby Ohio. My business travels bring me to Willoughby which is a very nice quaint town east of Cleveland.
Been here a few times for business occasions and once or twice on my own. 
I really like the Martini situation here, obviously one might guess by their name (a neat play on words we have seen before) that they have a special play in that vein. Last I was there, they had somewhere around 40 or so on their Martini Time menu. They also feature Sangria, Mojitos and Margaritas. I stick with the less complicated and more classic style myself.

I see many folks, and regulars who congregate here, filling the bar high-tops and booths after work to socialize over a drink or two. 


But beyond the libations, I also enjoy dinner here. Last time there I enjoyed a meal of Grilled Salmon --white cheddar risotto, asparagus and a blackberry port wine reduction..... This was just Delicious. The Salmon was cooked just perfect medium rare to medium. This was melt in your mouth tender and juicy with superb salmon taste. The cheddar risotto was incredibly rich and perfectly done. With the blackberry reductions the complexity of flavors in the mouth was very rewarding. Also I cannot fail to mention how outstanding the asparagus was. Again just perfectly cooked to allow the flavors to breakout in you mouth. Boy, I would get meal this again.

Flavor, atmosphere, and price are all winners here."}
{"text":"Pot roast. French fries.  Dear Lord...

What a great start.  Server was attentive but could tell when we were chatting.   

We were a few drinks in and got sat...busy Saturday night   had a few apps and then the server went MIA.  We had filets on our mind...full meals..and *poof* in one fell swoop all hopes and aspirations for a meal vanished.

By the time she showed to take our order it was 10pm.  Yeah we were chatting but damn...and we were no longer wanting a full meal.

So we shared another app (pizzas),further dashing  our hopes for a steak and tater meal.  So out tab dropped from potentially $150 to half that due to server inattention.

So our pizza get delivered and our server extraordinaire neglected to bring utensils therefore the pizza toppings and crust immediately separate...and I have not a fricking fork.  

My review started as a five and is quickly nosediving...

It really depresses me that a table health check completely escapes some servers...and when they are behind a bar they seem to get a full pass on maintaining a section. 

Completely disappointed.  We even flagged down the manager to explain that our server has been less than attentive and instead of asking us what the problem was he just ran over and got her brought her over to us then skittered off. All I wanted was a steak. Complete failure."}
{"text":"I love going for a drink on the PATIO... Excellent service, great drinks, nice atmosphere OUTSIDE......I stress outside because I can't sit inside because of the absolutely horrible smell!! It smells like a litter box! Gross!! Will not be returning until the patio is open!

I've only had food there one time and it was bland and way overpriced."}
{"text":"Went for a mixer in the private room. Appetizers were mediocre at best. They lacked flavor. We were promised $5 martinis as per the mixer invite, but our final bill didn't reflect this. When I asked, the server was very rude and said they don't do discounted drinks anymore."}
{"text":"Lunch meeting and I have to say it is very well appointed on the inside!
Our server was STELLAR and my compatriot LOVED his dish, what did I get?
C'mon it's like you don't even know me....
Of course burger and fries!!!!  Burger came out between medium and medium rare...
PERFECT!
Fries were a cut between shoestring and standard cut...Hot, fresh and again...Perfectly done!
Delish!!!
Odd thing? around 4p just as the day(thankfully) was winding down I got a really bad stomach ache that  I can pretty much attribute to an overdose of monosodium glutimate...As a preservative....thats why I dinged down at least a star....

But still very enjoyable...But get away from the chemicals!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of our favorites in DTW!  Great Martini's , ahi tuna, salmon I could go on and on.  A must stop if in the area.  Thank goodness we live close."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here because the time we came for just drinks, the food looked good. Extensive martini list- full of fruity choices if you're into that. Me, not so much. I was more interested in trying the food. 

We ordered stuffed banana peppers, calamari, and 2 pizzas to share. Pizzas were crab meat and marguerita. Stuffed banana peppers were good, but nothing exciting to note. Nice and spicy, for sure. The calamari was just ok as well. Kind of overcooked. 

The pizzas were majorly disappointing. Maybe I was expecting too much? Kind of tastes like something I could easily make at home. Nothing special about it. The marguerita pizza was, in my opinion, a major fail. This classic pizza was ruined with beefsteak, flavorless tomatoes and some sort of cheap mozzarella. Usually these are supposed to have a really good buffalo mozzarella. On top of that, the basil was cooked into it...so it came out to us a brownish color, not fresh and green. 

So the bottom line is, food is decent, but nothing out of this world and nothing to rave about. It's a nice restaurant with beautiful decor and nice atmosphere. Service is friendly also, so I give it one star just for that. 

Oh and P.S. I happened to overhear the table next to us complaining to the waitress about their flourless cake being very dry. One of the ladies at the table was asking if these came frozen, and if the waitress herself has tried this cake. Of course, the waitress said that the cake is made fresh in the restaurant."}
{"text":"On Friday morning I used the restaurant's web site to request a reservation for 8:00 p.m. I received confirmation of the reservation the next day on Saturday, followed by a second email saying, \"My bad. I hope you had a good time.\"

Unfortunately, that wasn't the only issue.

My group arrived at 8:00 and with no reservation we had to wait for a table. At the bar we couldn't get a drink. My wife asked someone for help and she said she'd send someone right over. That didn't go well either.

After finally being seated, the service was very slow and the food was not good, especially the calamari. One member of our party was satisfied with the mussels she ordered.

Fortunately the martinis were good.

Upon finishing our meal we waited about 25 minutes for our bill and finally had to ask someone to send over our server.

Poor service. Underwhelming food. Good martinis. That about sums it up."}
{"text":"I'm still a fan. 

I dropped in this weekend after Olivor Twist reopened after a week long remodel. I was never a regular, so I asked the hostess what had been updated. And the answer is, a lot, actually. New paint, carpet, lots of decor...if anything, the changes made an already place a little bit nicer.

Important to note is that the martini list seems to have been condensed. (or waitress said the list was cut in half) But there are still options for everyone. 

Still my favorite place to grab a martini in DTW. Worth checking out especially if you come for half-priced martinis on Wednesdays or Thursdays!"}
{"text":"This is my 4th or 5th time. It is very disappointing. Pumpkin ravioli filling was tasty but the pasta was undercooked. Even after I sent it back. Not worth it"}
{"text":"I haven't had the food here but we've been for after-dinner martinis a few times with friends who live locally. 

Wow. Huge martini list, not too strong, not too weak. Just right flavorings. My favorite (of course) is the Bloody Boru. Somehow, it's a bloody mary and a martini at the same time. Perfectly flavorful, perfect saltiness. Yum. We go there every time we're eating in Willoughby for an after-dinner drink."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have lunch, dinner, and/or drinks.  The martinis are fun, the servers are pleasant and knowledgeable, and the food is very good.  The patio is THE place to sit in downtown Willoughby in the summer.  Oh, yeah, and the name is a hoot.  Good job, whoever thought it up!"}
{"text":"They have a nice happy hour here. Half price pizzas and of course drink specials. Stylized decor and good service. Downtown Willoughby has a few places that get pretty raucous with the freshly 21 crowd in the evenings. Olivor Twist is more of an adult scene with proper attire required (not sure what that means exactly but it's posted on the door, no hats on sideways, no crocs, I can't wear my swim trunks?)"}
{"text":"What is up with the attitude of the server's and bartender outside tonight. Shame on you for your behavior.

It helps to smile once in awhile!"}
{"text":"This consistently continues to be one of my favorite locations to dine and grab a couple drinks. I cannot talk up the staff enough! They are so kind and genuinely want you to have a good experience at their restaurant. Be forewarned though, their martinis are delicious, but strong! The menu does not have a plethora of items, but everything I have tried is great and the prices are reasonable. My favorite dish is the chorizo mac n' cheese. If you are looking for a classy yet casual place to eat and grab drinks in Downtown Willoughby I would highly suggest Oliver Twist."}
{"text":"Service was great, from a prompt and polite greeting at the door to our sweetheart waitress. Food was excellent and decently priced. Drinks were strong and average priced. Great patio, noisy inside. I will be back."}
{"text":"Hands down, best food on the East side. Chef Rocky has been there over 10 years. You can never go wrong with the steak, but some of my other go-tos are the brisket and gouda pierogies, lobster mac n cheese, and crab ravioli. The sea scallops are always incredible.

I've ordered all the apps and they are good. I mostly get the stuffed peppers and mussels. The meat and cheese board is huge and worth every penny.  Sometimes I'll come in just for that with some wine. 

The patio is great. I love the half off pizza for happy hour.

Plus they have $6 martini Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Fun bar ....BIG menu of martinis but it drives me completely bonkers that I get zero cell phone signals!"}
{"text":"We came for my mother-in-law's birthday.   When we arrived, the bar service was very good.   

After our other guests arrived we were escorted to the front room, which was less full than the larger room.  From this point forward, my impression of this place disintegrated.   

First off, our server appeared to also be the bartender.  When she greeted us, her first words were \"we don't have any specials tonight, but...\"   Really?

After our first round of drinks and an appetizer order, we didn't see her for twenty minutes; everyone had empty beverages.  

When the food did arrive, some dishes were decent, others were mediocre.   She stopped by once more, and then later some other girl, who also appeared to be a bartender, came over and asked if we needed anything else.   

So, the service was a 1.5 of ten, the food a 3.9 and the ambiance in the front room was a 5.  Overall, disappointing."}
{"text":"I have yet to visit for dinner but they have what I'd consider the best lunches in Willoughby and that is what I'm basing the 5 stars off of.  Working in Willoughby and going out to eat for lunch every so often I've tried just about every place with in a 5 miles radius of my office.  This place has the best priced entrees and salads for what you get.  Very good sized lunch portions and excellent fresh food.  Plenty of healthy options too or you can at least make adjustments to anything they offer if you want it cooked differently.  Great place, check it out."}
{"text":"Another gem of a place in Downtown Willoughby.

I went on a Friday night and it was crowded (to be expected) but wasn't so crowded you couldn't move, which I found nice.

I sat up at the bar with a friend and watched the all-girl bar staff buzz about. Needless to say they have some pretty gals working in there who were nice and quick on the drinks. Naturally that put a grin to my face. Ha!

Neither my friend nor I tried the food but I intend to come back again.

Short review - will write more when I return. Definitely hit it up for a shot."}
{"text":"Having not been out in Willoughby before, I'd still heard of Olivor Twist.  It's obviously a staple and has a good reputation.  I just don't think that reputation is keeping up with the times.

We arrived as a large party, and I'll be honest-service was good.  The drinks were fine too.  What wasn't fine was the food.  My crab pizza was actually \"gross\".  I've never said that about pizza before!  It was frozen crab meat on an oily crust and laid in a bed of more oil?!???  I honestly think they were trying to mask the point that it didn't even taste like crab with olive oil.  (See my photo-I'm not exaggerating!) Some other reviews on the table were \"average\", \"overpriced\", \"just ok\", \"not worth my $70 bill\", and \"obviously a frozen ravioli from CostCo\".  

There are plenty of better options nearby.  Don't bother with Olivor Twist unless you're just there for drinks."}
{"text":"I really tried to like this place. I've been here a few times over the years. However, the food is WAY overpriced and mediocre at best. 8 dollars for salsa and chips? Seriously? All 3 of my dining companions were underwhelmed with their selections as well. I gave them 2 stars because at least the martinis were strong."}
{"text":"Overall: It was my first time here. I really liked the decor and the intimiate atmosphere. Our server was very friendly and attentive. Great selection of drinks. 

Food: I ordered calamari, goat cheese and roasted red peppers wrapped in prosciutto, and a pepperoni/sausage pizza for appetizers. Calamari was good but the quanitity was kind of small. The prosciutto and goat cheese was delicious! I thought the pizza was overpriced and was just ok. Saw some great reviews on the pizza but I left disappointed on that. We also ordered a burger and pork chops with mashed potatoes. My friend thought the burger was good but I thought my pork chops were extrememly dry. Not a big fan of the food. Might come back just for some drinks in the future."}
{"text":"Good drinks -- could use with less of the 'thick, sweet syrup' martinis and more of the craft cocktail martinis.  But good environment and nice servers.  Appetizers were good and the atmosphere is subtle and not too loud.  A good alternative to the loud, boisterous Brewing Company next door."}
{"text":"This is a fun place and you can't beat the drink prices!!! I haven't tried the food but the drinks are very good!"}
