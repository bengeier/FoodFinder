{"text":"excellent indian. thanks for existing! cheap, consistent, excellent thalis, quick service, BYOW, great butter chicken. what more can you ask for!!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent and service is really fast.
The place is really small and gets crowded super quickly. Staff will rush you to leave when you are finished to let people in and will not bring you desert if you ask for it when there are people in the line."}
{"text":"Bad food found hair in it .. and they went in nd addrd water to make it look new and brought back the same dish! !"}
{"text":"1 star for everything we ordered being tasty (chicken madrasi, aloo gobi, masoor masala dosa, samosas, garlic naan, rice...properly cooked rice is important).

1 star for spending $32 on a meal for two people that required us to move to a table for four.

1 star for super nice wait staff that a) told me what I ordered was spicy and then didn't make it mild when I said I like (love) spice and b) were awesome to us during dinner rush, great service.

1 star for having both the standards and a section of South Indian dishes to explore.

1 star for the masoor masala dosa.  You know when you try something new and it just makes your day?  It was like that.  This was on par with the first time I ate a giant barnacle.

I'm on a run of 5 star reviews this week, but lately I've just felt that budget places with great food and service need to be recognized to survive since it's tough to run a successful restaurant.  This place was packed when we went and not only was obvious why, they handled it cheerfully and everyone got a great experience.  I've paid $150 for dinner and been less satisfied."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Indian, but this place rocks...

Cheap, bring your own wine, butter chicken is a bit on the sweet side but it kills. The naan is so good soft and melts in your mouth.

The onion badjis were crispy and tender so good. Must go back so many dishes I gotta try :)"}
{"text":"We couldn't be bothered to wait 30-45 minutes for either Maison and Punjab, but our lack of patience and growling stomachs took us to Chand Palace. 

We saw a dude waiting in front of us carrying a bottle so we were like AWEEESOOOME!!! And we were the second group to be seated so we were like SCOOORE!!!  We were afraid that the food was gonna be gringo-fied, but it wasn't so we were like HAIL YEAAA!!!  You get the picture.

We got three mains all delicious - palak paneer, chicken tikka masala, lamb biryani and garlic naan - all for $35 inc tax and tips. Pretty amazing! We got super jealous when everyone at the table next to us had the little lunch box tray. Aw well next time! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've gone to most of the Indian places huddled around this corner (and believe me-- there are a lot!) but this is the one I come back to over and over again. 

This is definitely the place to go with a group of friends to eat family style and try a little of everything. The staff here is absolutely lovely and the place is immaculately kept. 

I adore their channa samosa; a crispy samosa heaped with spices chickpeas, fresh tomato and onions and spicy goodness. (and it *is* spicy). Other usual suspects at the table: shrimp vindaloo, palak paneer, bhangan bharta, onion baji, fish pakora and butter chicken (and of course, buttery naan). 

If, by chance you still have room after all that heavy goodness-- wash it down with a rich mango lassi and you're good to waddle out the door (without having blown your budget!) 

PS: This place is also bring your own booze."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this Indian greasy spoon. It's definitely a hole in the wall so not the fanciest restaurant. However, what Chand lacks in fanciness, it makes up in their delicious food. The naan is cooked to perfection, and the butter chicken is to die for. Whatever you order, you really can't go wrong! If it wouldn't for the nasty health effects of such delicious food, I would frequent this place more often."}
{"text":"I mean... Super Tiny.. It was packed!!! BUT the food was amazing, waitress was super friendly and did I say the FOOD WAS AMAZING... Tasty, spicy and it tasted like a homecooked meal... I will never again go to Bombay Mahal... Fancy people it's not for you!!!"}
{"text":"This cosy family restaurant, located on Jean Talon conveniently near l'Acadie is my favourite Indian place. Family run, the service is professional and efficient. They didn't mind making food specially to my taste preference as I am sensitive to spicy food. Every time I've gone to Chand Palace I've been greeted by the same quality of delicious food and affordable prices. They even do takeout! Although they do not have an alcohol license, it is BYOB making an even more affordable option."}
{"text":"This place is hands down my favorite place for Indian food in Montreal. The food is delicious and manages to be both wonderfully spiced, texturally perfect, and never greasy. I have a special fondness for the Butter Chicken lunch Thali, with its generous portions, its perfect creamy chicken, and its fluffy yet chewy nans. Finally, the place has great service, the waitresses here are always very efficient, bringing your food in record times, and a plate of padadums and chutney while you wait."}
{"text":"Real taste of indian food, a charming spice with naan it was great. The service was good. We had butter shrimp and curry shrimp."}
{"text":"BYOBooze and delicious Indian food. The food is portioned, which is a necessity for Indian food. No one had to roll me out from over-eating. Props to this place."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that Indian is my favorite cuisine, and I have eaten at probably 10 different Indian restaurants in Montreal alone. That being said, this one is by far my favorite. The food is super cheap, with lamb dishes coming to just 8.99. That means that two people can eat there with rice and naan and even two drinks for under $30. Without drinks it can be under $25 depending on the dishes you choose. Other than being cheap, the food is very good. The sauces are well seasoned and the ones that are listed as being spicy are actually spicy. The staff seems to all be part of an extended family, which is probably one of the reasons that everyone is so nice. The place is pretty small, so when it fills up it can be a bit loud, but if you are in the mood for Indian and you are on a budget this is absolutely the place to go. 

PS: This place is BYOB, and there are plenty of depanneurs in the area"}
{"text":"We were really impressed by the taste and quality of our food until the last few minutes of our meal. As the waitress was walking away with the scraps of our food, we saw another waitress walk by and grab our ALREADY USED sauce and serve it to another table. Very off putting and made us question what of our meal may have been already used by other customers. I don't know about you, but to me that brings down an entire meal. Would recommend one of the places nearby. Just as good."}
{"text":"The best Indian food in Montreal hands down!

Beware, the portions here are humongous. My girlfriend and I had the Aloo Tikki and the Chana Bhatura for starters, and we were almost full halfway through each of the dishes. We also ordered a Butter Chicken Thali and a Lamb Curry Thali.

They don't joke around with their spices, oh no. Each single dish was so well seasoned that \"every mouthful of food was an acute positive pleasure\" (Orwell 1945). They're serious, they're mean, they're furious with those seasonings, I could picture the chef throwing them spices at the uncooked meat and veggies screaming \"oh I'm gonna season you so bad!\"

However, the dishes are not overwhelming or difficult to eat, they're not too greasy or too salty and go perfectly with the naan and the rice. The Butter Chicken tasted really nice with a rich, savoury coconut cream-based sauce (although the chicken itself was really dry). The Lamb Curry had a melt-in-your-mouth texture and a hearty, rich taste with a hint of cumin.

The service was caring, personal, and very efficient; somehow one waitress was able to serve a fully booked restaurant without leaving anyone a bad experience. Apparently you can bring your own wine, which makes it great for groups.

The price of the dishes varies between 4~7$, really good value since you can get lots of food. The only downside is that they charge taxes but do not give any receipts..."}
{"text":"Chand Palace has yummy affordable food. I've eaten there three times and ordered take out once.

On a mid week evening or during the day its totally chill. But it is VERY crowded and noisy on busy weekend evenings. My boyfriend and I were seated at one of the higher and larger three person tables, beside the cash. Because of the seating arrangement and crammed nature of the restaurant our server asked us to sit across from each other. We basically had to yell to hear each other. Not good for a date.

The servers were working hard, but interactions with them were rushed. We also had people basically sitting at our table as they waited for take out.

The other bonus is its byob. My suggestion is get take out and eat it in Park Jarry or go earlier in the week. After 3 varied experiences we will likely try a different place for our next date night."}
{"text":"Affordable and close to metro.

Butter 'chicken' with tofu AKA Vegetarian butter chicken AKA possibly vegan AKA my life is made. The sauce was bomb, thick and oh so buttery. Naan bread was also some of the best I've had.

Service was quick and pleasant - lots of smiles.

Lost one point for serving what seemed like a day ( or longer ) old samosa.

Overall good indian food and will go back!"}
{"text":"So I found Chand Palace by searching for \"Best Indian\" on Yelp and I agree 100%! I was looking for a place to go with a group of friends with whom I recently traveled to India. This was my first Indian meal since getting back from our trip about a month ago and it did not disappoint. 

The restaurant is cozy and full of great energy. Everything we ordered was very tasty, nicely spiced and well presented in nice serving bowls. The resto had the authentic feel of a typical hole in the wall Indian restaurant, but was a notch or two up the scale on presentation, cleanliness and decor. 

We all loved the food and as we were leaving decided that we would be back to Chand Palace again soon to reminisce some more about our travels to India. All this for $11/person and it is a BYOB!"}
{"text":"Great find. Simple authentic Indian food. Nothing fancy but definitely gives me my Indian fix. The restaurant is small but clean. Good service and consistently good.  Really good value, especially for lunch as their Thali plate is really good."}
{"text":"Best shahee paneer I have had in Montreal. Thick gravy, soft cheese curd, perfect level of spicy. Thinking of it is making me want to go back. Honestly, amazing amazing cheese dish, must try! We also tried their garlic naan which was crispy and light. Fluffiness amidst all the butter Is a measure of a good naan. Their madrasi chicken was also soft and had flavourful elements of curry leaf. Their aloo gobi was spicy but very very delicious. They also served paapar in the beginning which is always appreciated. The staff is very friendly; they let us order at 10:15 even though the kitchen was closed 15 minutes ago when we were really hungry and we had nowhere to go because all the other places in Park ex were already closed.One of the best Indian places in town hands-down."}
{"text":"The food was good. I loved their naan, and the samosas are to die for. We went there on a sunday night and it was pretty full. The only downside is that there was only one waitress for the whole restaurant, so getting her attention could be hard at times."}
{"text":"I loved the chicken curry and aloo ghobi as well as the shahi paneer. The food also comes at a reasonable price. I'll definitely visit this place again for their naan and chicken curry."}
{"text":"Good Indian food- I go for a place with authenticity, hole in the wall kinda places but popular by word of mouth- chand fits that description. Along with similar sites like Punjab palace. Very east coast feel, only groups of 3 or 4 at a time- no reservations or take away. Best part - Byow -no corkage fees!

I usally order a papdi chaat as a starter (good for 2) basically contains fried tortillas, garnished with yogurt, tamarind sauce, tomatoes, onions and various spices; followed by the Shahi paneer and the spicy mushroom dish! Soo good be warned the mushrooms are on the spicy side! Sides include naan or rice. All dishes are under 10$!

 I love the area because you can go grocery shopping, get your eyebrows done for 3$ and good food on the go!"}
{"text":"This is the corner of Birnam and Jean-Talon, where the top tier resto's duke it out.

My favorite in Parc Ex is India Beau Village on Jarry, but for Jean-Talon, this is the place to eat.
I remember this being Curry and Naan a while back, who were very good, but closed shop. This is taken over by new owners and staff.

The food is quite simply amazingly fresh. The place is small and you could hear them making the food ( which is rare in this day of prepackaged and re-heated).

I've had the Chicken Tikka, huge portion and deliciously spicy. 
I also had the Chicken 65,  very hard to find in Montreal ($6.50 is a great price).
The palau rice is about $3 and well worth it.

My friend had the thali with lamb curry and he said it was awesome, the potatoes ,rice and naan were great.

The service is very quick and friendly, they brought us complementary papadum and rice pudding at the end.

Last time i passed by the area and the place was packed, while other places that have disappointed me were practically empty, seems word of mouth moves fast."}
{"text":"Alright! I took my girlfriend up on her suggestion to try Chand Palace, and we visited on a Sunday morning. She had eaten here before, and wanted me to try their butter chicken plate. 

I ordered the butter chicken plate and my girlfriend ordered the Tikka masala lamb plate. We also ordered a dish of 2 vegetarian samosas ($1.50 for 2!!). The food was served in a stainless steel compartmentalized plate that was separated into the chicken, a potato curry, a small green salad and naan on a bed of rice. You are getting an incredible value for the price (below $10). The curry was a little spicy (although it wasn't specified as so in the menu), but it was manageable. Their naan bread is served warm and very soft.

Overall, I had a really enjoyable meal and would definitely come here again!!"}
{"text":"We were staying a couple minutes outside of downtown Montreal, and wanted some reliably good eats. So we walked to a particularly South Asian dining area, and stopped at Chand Palace.

As you step into the restaurant you quickly realize that you're going to be enjoying a close quarters meal. Space is a luxury in here.

For my meal, I chose the lamb curry. I've always been a fan of the texture of well cooked lamb served along side a distinct flavour sauce or gravy, and I wasn't disappointedd at Chand. The curry was well seasoned, appropriately spicy, and just overall comforting. I definitely would have appreciated a bigger serving.

We enjoyed it enough to come back later in the week, at which time I got my hands on their Thali Non-Vegi with Chicken, which is a platter that comes with chicken, chicken curry, a potato veggie dish, naan, rice, and so-so salad. Though there was nothing wrong with this dish, I would not jump to order it again, and would instead opt for that banging curry.
And by the way, this place is BYOB, so feel free to bring whatever you feel.

I think this place is swell, and I'm sure you would too. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Amazing thalis. My favourite Indian joint on Jean-Talon ever since Pushap down the street changed management a few years ago."}
{"text":"Got takeout from here since the restaurant itself was packed. 

The food here is amazing and I would highly recommend coming here to try everything."}
{"text":"This is one good authentic Indian BYOB in Parc-Ex that consistently delivers. They have the best naan in the neighborhood in my opinion: crisp outside, hot and chewy inside. The spinach-based dishes like Palak Paneer and Lamb Saag have an amazing creamy texture, spiced but not spicy. The Goat Curry had fall-off-the-bone meat. Chicken Tikka Masala was a great one as well. The Chicken Jalfraizie and Thali special were less impressive in comparison. None of the food was overly salty.

Service at Chand Palace is miles apart from the other Indian places in the neighborhood. It's consistently friendly and fast. One can afford to order again after finishing the first serving, and trust me, for such quality at the prices they charge, it will be hard to resist. I would not hesitate to bring a friend/date/my second stomach to Chand Palace. Debit or cash."}
{"text":"Deuxième visite à ce resto. Dernière fois, j'ai été quand il allait fermé donc je n'ai pris que 2 plats...Bref, cette fois-ci j'ai pu savouver comme il faut. J'ai pris trois entrées différentes, Samosas, oignons frit et les crevettes Pakora. Toutes les trois délicieuse. J'ai pris un Thali comme plat pricipal. Si vous voulez goûter à un peu de tout je vous le conseille. 7$ pour un Thali en souper et cela inclut le pain Naan, du riz blanc, un morceau de poulet Tandori, des legumes cuits et un morceau de tomate et concombre et un super bon poulet au beurre. Super repas pour moins de 15$ chacun :) (Nous étions 2) Je suis habitué à aller au Punjab Palace, mais je crois que je vais allet plus souvent là. Il y a beaucoup moins de monde (dans le sens que c'est intime), c'est un peu moins cher et  c'est délicieux et surtout le service est meilleur :) 

Ah oui! ET SURTOUT C'EST UN APPORTEZ VOTRE VIN :)

Bonne visite!"}
{"text":"We usually go to Dee's for our eyebrows threading. It's lunchtime, plus it's raining hard. So we took shelter at this restaurant. The restaurant was empty, we were the first customers, then slowly it the filled up for lunch.

Being an Indian, I know the food well, therefore I am sadly disappointed with most the food. My mango lassi was perfect. Pani Puri was a let down; not enough vegetables and the sauce was bland, not enough spices. Samosas another letdown, the filling was ok, so I just ate that but the pastry was absorbed by the oil so much. Paneer Pakora, I have no complaints. Parantas (plain))were over cooked and the taste was bitter. Aloo (potato) parantas tasted more ginger than the potato. 

In the other hand, the service was good and super quick.

Honestly, I don't really recommend this place. If you want to go to a small authentic Indian restaurant; I recommend Pushap and Thali (near Concordia)."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant in Parc extension.  It is BYOB but if you plan on getting dépanneur booze I suggest you get it before because the dépanneurs around tend to be a bit pricey for what they're selling. 

The food is served pretty quickly and they have great prices. The service is not the greatest but fits perfectly with what you get around in that area. The food is tasty and you can easily get doggy bags to take home. They always give a big pitcher of water to every table which is pretty neat."}
{"text":"There are plenty of Indian restaurants on Jean Talon street, so there are many options to choose from. I tried plenty and most were amazing except this restaurant, which forces me to write a review about it.

I stumbled upon this restaurant on yelp and got intrigued by the 4 Star rating. I was expecting so much, but as soon as I walked in, it was a tiny, cramp restaurant with no walking space for even the waitresses. Don't come here in groups! There's really not enough space for you all to fit without being bumped constantly by passersbyers.

The service was swift and friendly. The waitresses were very attentive and helped explain any questions about the menu. They were apologetic when they forgot about our dish.

The food however was very disappointing. I ordered a butter chicken and chilli mushroom and asked for both to be very spicy. First of all, the chilli mushroom is supposed to be served with Indian spices, but the dish resembled Chinese general tao chicken. The sauce was similar and had no traces of Indian taste. Very strange. Next was the butter chicken. It lacks flavour in general, but wasn't awful. I asked the waitress to bring it back to the kitchen to make it spicy like I requested. She told me that it already is very spicy. The spice level was a joke and tasted sweet. Even the person I went with tried it and said it wasn't spicy at all. The butter chicken and chilli mushroom costed the same price of $8.99, though the chilli mushroom was definitely not worth that price. The butter chicken was bland, yet stood out much more. 

In the end, I looked around and about two tables were Indian customers. The rest were Caucasians and foreigners like myself, which may explain why the food was watered down and weak in spice because of the targeted customers. Just an observation. 

If you want authentic Indian flavours, this is not the place."}
{"text":"Testé lors d'un Lunch Break  Yelp, j'ai vraiment adoré.

Vu de l'extérieur et même à l'intérieur ça ne paie pas de mine, mais il ne faut pas se fier aux apparences. 

La nourriture est excellente, j'adore l'indien et j'ai été gâté, ça goûté vraiment la cuisine traditionnel comme si c'était la grand-mère qui cuisinait pour nous. L'assiette est énorme il y a vraiment de quoi manger, et surtout ce n'est pas très cher.

Donc zéro hésitation il faut tester."}
{"text":"I loved the food and the price, the only problem you may have is with parking. The restaurant itself is a bit of a tight fit, but if you're there at a less busy time it's worth it. 

If you're on a budget - and who isn't at this time of year - then one of the thali plates is a must-have. I got the butter chicken thali which came with a veggie curry, rice, a naan bread, and a few salad vegetables (possibly something else...) and a mango lassi. The lassi was sweet and thick, perfect for cutting the spice, although I didn't have a problem with the heat level. For less than 13$ (including tax and tip) I was stuffed and left with a smile on my face."}
{"text":"Looking for indian food and following my trusted Yelp fellows, we decided to try Chand Palace.
Even though we got there rather early (a little bit after 6pm - yes I did forget that people eat early around here!), the place was already busy.
We managed to get a little table near the kitchen and near everyone else (expect to eat sitting very very close to people you don't know - good if you want to meet strangers, bad if you're on the asocial side like me!).
Being cold, we started with soups, a dhal and a Malcatani, both were quite good. We then followed with a veggie thali and a lamb one. Again, both were quite good. The naan was delicious, the rice maybe a little dry but overall quite good.
The reason I am not giving it a higher star-rating is that, thanks to the expeditive service, we were in and out of there in under 25 minutes. So, if you're looking for a place to take your time to enjoy the food and company, this might not be the place."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite Indian restaurant in park ex. It's BYOB and the food is always tasty and consistent. I almost always get the veggie thali. The mains vary so the thali is always a little different from the last. Everything else I've tried on the menu is great too (butter chicken, lamb curry, biriani, samosas). Service is fast and courteous. It's a small restaurant so expect it to be to packed on Friday and Saturday nights. Not the best looking one in terms of looks but I really don't mind as the food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Bon, propre, gentille serveuse,... Et vraiment abordable !!!! Malgré que c'est trop bruyant je laisse 5 étoiles car c'est une bonne place à connaître pour les gens qui aime manger indien dans un endroit propre !"}
{"text":"Chand Palace is by far one of the most affordable Indian food experiences in Montréal. While it certainly isn't the best I've ever had (hint hint Darbar), you will definitely get what you pay for.

The atmosphere isn't really anything to write home about, since it seems like your stereotypical clean dining room setting, so if you care about that sort of thing, then perhaps it wouldn't be ideal for you. But I believe restaurant reviews, as I have stated before, should focus on the food at heart. I ordered the mango lassi and the butter chicken thali, of which I have heard many good things. The mango lassi was cold, fruity, and creamy perfection that left me wanting more. The flavors provided a nice contrast to the contents of the thali, which included salad, a vegetable dish, tandoori chicken, butter chicken (obviously), and rice and naan. The vegetable dish was definitely the standout of the meal, as it was spiced quite nicely and complemented the naan quite nicely. In addition, I liked how the naan wasn't too thick, yet it was still chewy enough to soak up all of the flavors. The butter chicken melded sweet and savory together in a seamless fashion, and it was definitely one of the better chicken curry-like dishes I've had in my lifetime. The only thing I wish was better would have to be the tandoori chicken, for I felt it could have used some more flavoring, but it still tasted juicy and was well-cooked overall.

Come here if you want a satisfying Indian meal on a budget, and, if you're like me, willing to voluntarily take the metro to explore different areas culinary-wise. You won't regret it by any means."}
{"text":"3 etoiles c'est peu, je sais! La raison c'est que d'une fois a l'autre ca peut-etre bon ou ben ordinaire voir decevant. A l'ouverture c'etait tres bon et a ma derniere fois j'ai regretté de l'avoir choisis. 

Ca reste que ca peut etre bon, que le service est excellent pour pour un resto indien, c'est propre et les portions sont bonnes. 

+++Pas cher du tout, tres abordable!"}
{"text":"Bonne petite place pour manger indien dans un quartier où la concentration de cette cuisine est importante !
Les samousas végétariennes sont exquises, je pense que je n'ai jamais autant apprécié une samousa.
Mes crevettes étaient assez relevé mais très bonnes avec des légumes qui ont cuits tranquilement dans un poele et servis directement dans la poele.
Pour le prix je ne peux que recommander et en plus c'est juste à coté du métro Acadie donc accessible facilemtn ;)"}
{"text":"Very very very good, great service, and our food came out fast. Best Indian food in Montreal!"}
{"text":"L'endroit est microscopique et plutôt à l'écart de la portion très achalandée de Jean-Talon, mais il serait vraiment dommage de ne pas faire un petit détour pour y découvrir une cuisine pleine de saveurs. La toute petite salle est par contre particulièrement bruyante aux heures de pointe, mais vous pouvez prendre pour emporter"}
{"text":"Excellent food for the price and the staff is really nice. The butter chicken is of course amazing :)"}
{"text":"Pretty, cozy, and shining clean inside with a staff of just lovely, thoughtful, soft-spoken ladies. I was brought here by the ever-wise Krista M who never disappoints, so I just ordered one of whatever she was having. We kept it simple with the butter chicken thali and the flavours and textures were just perfect in both veg dishes and in the dreamy creamy butter chicken sauce. Perfect naan too, light and chewy and buttery and crispy all at the same time. Next time I'll come back for dosas and bring my own wine. Who's coming with me? =)"}
{"text":"All around tasty! Jumped in for a quick bite before running off to work after an appointment so I was the first client of the day. The food was well portioned and had a student level price tag.  Its a smaller place but now that I know its BYO I'll definitely go out of my way to stop in."}
{"text":"Excellent quality food and clean kitchen (I could see through the window cut-out) but the chicken biriyani was too saucy and didn't taste so authentic, but not bad by any means - it was better the next day after the rice absorbed the sauce more. But the portions are also small, which is not fun when wanting to share, in order to have leftovers you have to order more than one dish."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here. We ordered curry chicken, butter chicken, rice, and naan. Everything was good but the butter chicken was GREAT! We'd definitely eat here sg fin next time we're in Montreal."}
{"text":"We usually love going to Bombay Mahal, but the queue was quite big last night, like 25 ppl, and we noticed this place only had a queue of 4 ppl, and seemed like a similar deal, so we walked over.

It was really good. Really yummy, tasty, Indian food. Regular fare. And it's BYOW too. 

However, I do think I prefer the taste of the food at Bombay Mahal, even if minutely different. But that said, Bombay Mahal's food always leaves me feeling bloated. So I'd have to say I'm about equal with both place, and will just go wherever the shorter queue is."}
{"text":"Under new management and offering warm welcomes and delicious food, \"Chand Palace\" is a cozy 2nd floor walk-up formerly called \"Curry & Naan.\" In addition to mouth-watering thali the new menu includes a variety of dosas (mmmmm...), indian 'pizza' and is BYOB. It offers fresh, delicious fare at a very, very reasonable price. Shortly after moving to Park Ex I ate out frequently while settling in and the thali were SO good and cheap there ($5.99-$6.99 for dinner, one dollar cheaper for lunch!) that I brought different friends to \"Chand Palace\" six times in two weeks. (insert blush here) I tried to go to other places for variety but really, when you've found a great thing...

The veggie thali is consistently good but the spice level varies - always dal, sometimes paneer, always delicious. Fluffy naan, basmati rice and a few leaves of pale lettuce are included. I recommend ordering raita (cooling yogurt condiment) if you aren't used to too much spice. The butter and curry chicken thali are also delicious and although I didn't try it, a friend ordered the spicy goat and was over the moon. 

And if for some crazy reason you've got room for dessert a divine selectionof indian sweets await you right next door to Chand Palace. Get a gorgeous silver box to go..."}
{"text":"Amazing, affordable and authentic Indian food. I have tried my fair share of indian restruaunts in Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and here and I have to say that for Canadian standards this is one of the best on the affordable side of things. Highly recommended. It can be very busy but I have never had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"This place was very high rated and we wanted to try something new from our typical Punjab Palace so we thought we would try it out. My meal was fine, good so I give it average scores, but Jenviev wasn't at all happy with her meal. The lamb curry was what I had. The vegetarian thali was not very good, especially after Doaba Deli in New York that was mad good! I tried all the vege dishes and I would say the strength of the meat dishes. Good average Indian."}
{"text":"While craving Indian food in Montreal, we first went to Darbar, which seemed like you had to have a reservation to get in. Then, we wanted to try Maison, but there was also a huge line. We saw Chand Palace across the street from Maison, walked in, and though it was busy, got a table right away. Our server was very polite, (even though we made ordering food a complicated ordeal). The food came out fast, hot, and delicious. I especially loved the creamy sauce of the butter chicken and the soft naan. The prices? About $70 for 5 people, including apps and beverages. Not bad, I say, I'd definitely return if I lived in Montreal."}
{"text":"I went there a couple of time. Also ordered take out many times. Its not my favorite indian in montreal. I do prefer the one accross the street. Seems like the cooks put too much salt in everything.  Servicr is good. But nobody speak french."}
{"text":"J'ai essayé plusieurs restos indiens juste à côté de cet endroit. Je parle de Punjab Palace, Indian Curry House et Bombay Mahal. Je dois dire que celui-ci est vraiment bon, le meilleur même. Je suis allée avec mon amie, étant une fan finie de cuisine indienne elle-même, elle m'a dit \"Je juge le resto indien par le pain naan et celui-ci est parfait\". Quant à moi, je juge l'endroit par le poulet Tandoori et la qualité du Thali (le genre de plat en métal avec 3 différents compartiments). Le poulet était gros et pas du tout \"sec\" comme aux autres restos. Mon non-vege Thali était délicieux, varié et pas trop épicé."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. The staff are quick and kind, the food is consistently delicious, you can get a full meal for under 10$ AND it's BYOB. 

What else could a girl ask for??"}
{"text":"I had to get my indian fix yesterday so I decided to hit this small and cool spot in ParcEx. 15$ for all the variety and quantity of food I had. Pretty good deal.

I first ordered a mango lassi smoothie, which was excellent and perfect to dose the spicyness of my appetizer and main course. First, veggies samosas. Very good with tamarin sauce. Then I tried the butter chicken thali and the lamb thali. They were both all good and full of flavors. Garlic naan bread was soft and crispy. 

The waitress was pretty friendly.

THX CHAND!"}
{"text":"Having lived in Dubai and Bahrain, we fell in love with Indian cuisine and we were hopeful To find a replacement. We highly recommend this restaurant and the food tasted authentic Indian (10 years of eating Indian cuisine)."}
{"text":"Super  place  indienne. Beaucoup  a  manger  pour  le  prix! la  nouriture  etait  vraiment  bonne. Par compte  leur  poulet au  beurre  est une  petite  affaire  trop  sucré"}
{"text":"I got a butter chicken thali and I wanted so bad to be able to finish it but I was too full. Everything was delicious, but the highlight (it's going to sound crazy) was the Naan. It is the best Naan I have had in Montreal."}
{"text":"Small place with decent food. The staff is very helpful. Wasn't exactly authentic Indian food..

Light on the wallet - It is a bit cramped for space though."}
{"text":"Je suis allée au Chand Palace grâce à la gang de BYO Monday. Arrivée la dernière, je me suis assise alors que tout le monde était en train de discuter \"on partage\" versus \"chacun pour soi\" avec un consensus pour le partage. Puisque j'aime pas mal tout, et qu'en terme de cuisine indienne je n'ai jamais mangé quelque chose que je n'ai pas aimé, mais aux pires des endroits, j'ai laissé le reste de la table décidé. Et c'était bon! Il y avait un peu de tout et même quelques plats nouveau pour moi: des crevettes aux beurre...  mmm... j'en rêve encore!

En plus c'est un apportez votre vin et la majorité des tables semblaient en profiter. Ça n'est pas l,endroit le plus luxueux (c'est presque style cantine), mais l'éclairage et l'ambiance en général rend l'endroit quand même intime et chaleureux. J'en suis sortie le ventre plein ayant eu la chance de goûté à tous les plats et ça coûté seulement 15 $ taxes et un généreux pourboire inclus.

La rumeur veut aussi qu'ils ont des superbes assiettes végétarienne pour l'heure du lunch pour environ 5-6$ qui sont tellement généreuses que vous aurez des restants, garanti! Donc, je risque fort bien de ré-essayer le Chand Palace!"}
{"text":"Holy moly cheap Batman, plus it's BYOW. The shahi paneer and the butter shrimp were yummy but the naan wasn't my favourite to be quite honest. Chand Palace is super close to the Metro so it's easy to get to, and it's good for groups. Fast and friendly service and tons of choices on the menu: solid pick to get your Indian on."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken vindaloo with a na'an, a fried bread, and a garlic na'an.

Chicken vindaloo:
Good flavors but the hotness and the saltiness were a bit overwhelming. I had a hard time tasting the other flavours (spices) in a distinguishable manner.

Na'an: 
Very nice, partly because it was baked with oil. Makes me wanna come back just for this.

Fried bread: no, never again. Greasy and bland, tasted like fried dough. 

Garlic Na'an: Covered with finely chopped garlic but not much flavor coming out from them. Not as good as the simple na'an at 1.25$, cheapest item on the menu.

I usually don't talk about service, but I feel like I should say something about the lack of waiters in this place. The water was never filled, and the waiters never came to us unless we waved."}
{"text":"By now, it's no secret that Chand Palace is one of, if not the best spot in town for an affordable Indian thali. I've been going here for at least 5 years and I'll be the first person to tell you that the quality of the food has not diminished despite its newfound popularity among those outside of Parc Ex. I live in The Sud-Ouest and never regret making the commute out to indulge with my boyfriend or wow out-of-town guests who have never experienced the magic of a good thali.

Let's dig into a typical visit to Chand Palace: it doesn't matter what time of day it is, there will always be a crowd already inside. Don't let this dishearten you. I promise it is worth the wait (and the line always moves fast!). Once inside, you'll be greeted with menus and on the house papadum to snack on while you make your decision. I recommend indulging in an order of pakoras or onion bhajis along with your main meal. It's a lot of food, and you'll have leftovers to bring home, but their deliciously crispy apps are not to be missed.

The thali is always worth it, for lunch or for dinner (the price increases a bit at dinner time). You never know what dishes you'll get, but it makes every visit exciting -- and it's a great way to ensure you're always trying something new even if you fall into the habit of going to Chand for every occasion (guilty). My personal favourite is the shahi paneer. I've yet to find another Indian restaurant to make it so creamy and delightful!

Every time I leave Chand Palace, I'm amazed by the quality-to-price ratio. I'm not exaggerating when I say you can take a group of 5 out to a dinner for under $75. This makes for a great economical trick when you want to treat your out-of-town guests to a delicious meal on you!

Oh, and don't forget: Chand Palace is BYOB so make sure to stop in at an SAQ before making your way to Parc Ex (where the Depanneur wine is insanely overpriced)."}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday at 10:30am (right when they opened) in a group of 7. 

The service was nothing extraordinary. It was ok. Our waitress seemed a little lost and disorganized from time to time, but in her defence, they had literally just opened, so she might've also been busy with preparing the restaurant for the rest of the day. 

It was the first time for 4 of us, so we all got the butter chicken lunch special. It came with 2 pieces of naan bread, a portion of rice, some butter chicken, some cooked veggies (im sorry! I don't know what it's called!), a piece of chicken and a \"salad\". 

The more experienced people got a la carte things that I don't understand. 

The \"bread\" (pappadum) that was given while we waited for the food was so good! It was more like chips than bread. Super thin and crunchy. It was well seasoned and cooked to perfection. The green sauce (chutney) that came with it was also quite tasty. 

Only one of us got an entree (veggie samosa). It was huge! She split it into 4 pieces and we each got a big bite. It was quite bell seasoned. 

When my food came on a pretty unattractive platter, I was a little let down, since there didn't seem to be THAT much food. Well, I was wrong. I ended up being way too full! 

The butter chicken was delicious. The sauce was amazing. The chicken itself was meh and a little dry, but the sauce. Wow wow wow!

The cooked veggies were pretty good. A tiny bit spicy, but well seasoned. 

The single piece of chicken seemed a bit random to me, but I ate it. It was ok. Just slightly dry chicken. 

The salad was a let down. It was just a few sad pieces of lettuce, a slice of tomato and a slice of cucumber. Although, it was a welcomed change from the rest of the meal which was on heavier side. 

So, it seems that 4 stars might be a bit generous, since there are a few points that didn't totally meet my expectations. HOWEVER, I paid a total of 9$ for that meal. 9 dollars for a meal that made me so full that I couldn't even finish! That's pretty darn amazing to me. 

So head over there and feast!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent option and very attractively priced. I got a mixed plate of chicken curry, naan, pakora, tandoori, papadum, and a really great vegetarian curry. All for approximately $10 bucks with tax (plus tip).

Decor is not a strength of this place - but this doesn't seem to be the case for most Indian resto options in this area."}
