{"text":"Service was great. Food was awful. Shrimp and mushroom pasta had the strangest flavor I've ever tasted - literally inedible. Caesar side salad was good size, but lettuce was soggy and shredded Parmesan cheese was as hard as sticks. Truly the worst meal I've had, maybe ever"}
{"text":"Driving through town on a Friday evening and had dinner here.  I have to admit, I was not impressed.  Granted, we did not have reservations, but it took ages to get a table, and then when we did, the service was very slow.    Do NOT order the cheese pasta with smoked pork.  Don't give me wrong, I love a good cheesy pasta, and order it from many restaurants, but this was a disaster.  Cavatapi noodles simply drowning in cheese sauce.  (I literally picked the noodles out and what was left was, and I am not exaggerating, more than a cup of just cheese sauce swimming in the bottom of the bowl.)  Also the smoked pork seemed to be nothing more than sliced up deli ham.  Very disappointing.    The other meals at the table were adequate, but nothing to make up for the downfalls.    Pretty sure we would not try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere in a great location. Food and service were top notch. Can't wait to visit again. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great pizza with great service.  Here for EPIC training so good eats after a long day is always good. Going tomorrow to try the wings."}
{"text":"Great lunch or dinner spot. Their lunch salmon is beautifully presented and delicious. Great brewed iced tea. Sat out on their patio, which was lovely. Went with a group of 6 people and everyone greatly enjoyed their meals and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Terrible service, J.L.  was our server, she showed up two times at our table, once for our drinks and once for our bill. We actually wanted more than one drink and an appetizer or dessert clearly that was not our choice. The Perch had bones in it, and the tartar sauce was obviously from Cisco. Oh yeah, if you liked the fries from high school, you should enjoy the terrible crinkle cut fries they serve here."}
{"text":"I'm in Wisconsin for work this week and wanted to check out a local bar. I really liked this place, everyone was very nice and the beer was delicious (Hopalicious). Even better was the food, I had the cashew chicken pasta and it was amazing for bar food. It was sweet and creamy and came with a pretzel roll which matched perfect. I will be back just to eat this again.  Foodie scale: 4 Value scale: 5"}
{"text":"My favorite is the sweet potato soup. Cheeseburger was good too. Everyone was very friendly- service was great!"}
{"text":"A hidden little gem.... we always try to time our outings to Menards nearby, so that we can catch lunch in the bar.  Their soups are divine, I would guess made from scratch, and with a nice glass of wine, oh so yummy.  Sandwiches are good, too!  We've always had excellent, prompt service. I will second another reviewers review- a nice place with very good food in a quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"In town for the night and their menu was in my hotel. I ordered the blackened walleye, wild rice and corn chowder as a side. I travel quite a bit and this was by far the best \"takeout\" I have had. Can't say anything about the restaurant itself but as a take-out place I will order from there next time I am in town."}
{"text":"The Friday Nite Fish Fry was not that great.  First off, to get a booth you have to have reservations, otherwise they put you at a table.  The booths are reserved for those with reservations.  Next, the wait service was very slow.  We waited for about 10 minutes before we were asked for drinks, then waited another 10 minutes for 4 simple tap beers.  Next the food was very slow to get to the table and not very warm.  We ordered the baked fish and it was OK but nothing special.  I ordered the sweet potatoes and they were not hot enough to melt a pad of butter.  The wait staff did sense our disstifaction and comped us some cheese curds.  That raised our spirits just a little bit.    With so many choices for Friday Fish, I would not put this place very high on my list - look elsewhere. Maybe the burgers are better??"}
{"text":"Was in town at Epic and found this place! Enjoyed the chicken parmesan and a nice glass of Malbec. The food and service were both excellent!"}
{"text":"Truly disappointed.  The food was greasy, tasteless and expensive.  I felt like I was eating at an expensive dive."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Once for late night drinks in the bar, once for Friday fish fry with family, and once for happy hour appetizers and drink in the bar. All 3 visits were pleasant and met expectations. Both bar and dining area was clean and comfortable. Pricing was average. Food was tasty.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Walked over from my hotel for a late dinner, as there really isn't anything else adjacent. The place has the typical decor for those places that have names beginning with initials. The good: The SW BBQ pizza was very good, and came fairly quickly after my order. Local beers on tap (tried the Wisconsin Amber and something called Lake House). Bill was less than $25. The uneven: This appears to be a place favored by nearby professionals -- so much so that the bartenders spend much time in conversation with the regulars and not so much time with those who are unfamiliar. Spent a notable amount of time waiting to get a beer, then order food, even though the place wasn't overrun with people. Verdict: I'd go back if I was in the same situation and didn't want to drive anywhere else. But nothing made it a gotta-return place."}
{"text":"Nice place in a spot where there isn't much else.  Stopped for lunch the other day, sat at a bar table. The bar is very open and not very intimate.  But we had a burger with fries and chicken tenders, both were good.  In general Adlers seemed very standard, but worth coming back to. Clean, not rowdy, good service , good food."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! My mom and I went for margaritas, then shared the smoked salmon on cavatappi noodles in a white sauce. It was served with a pretzel bun and a garden salad. Sometimes when sharing meals we don't get a sufficient amount of food, however we were stuffed and satisfied when we left. Staff was warm and welcoming. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"So this little place is a great place to stop and get some after-work drinks! Reasonably priced and food is pretty good too. It's in a nice little place near Brenan's however it is a little generic but not too shabby. I LOVE the fact they have outdoor seating, it is nice to see it because I feel like more and more places are getting rid of outdoor seating which should be the opposite. Again pretty generic but not too shabby for a quick bite to eat and drink."}
{"text":"Had the Friday night fish fry, the food was good, the service from Courtney was flawless."}
{"text":"Adler's was one of my favorite places on this side of town when I lived in Madison, and it's a place that I wouldn't mind going back to the next time I visit.  It's true that it's in the fairly-common-in-Madison category of upscale bar food, but with its relaxed atmosphere and generally good quality, it's an enjoyable place to catch up with friends, and good for conversation since it usually doesn't get too loud.  The chicken tenders in particular deserve calling out, as they're what kept me coming back again and again.  Before discovering Adler's, I was in a chicken tender drought, as the place I used to go for them, where they were good enough that one of my vegetarian friends made an exception for them, had discontinued theirs.  Adler's, however, are fantastic, and a worthy replacement.  They deserve the \"tender\" in their name.  Sometimes they're just a bit too hot when the arrive, but if you can wait long enough that they wont burn your tongue, you'll be rewarded.  I'm hungry now just writing about them.  Otherwise, the food falls into the category of pretty good.  Their burgers?  Pretty good.  Not really better than the Great Dane's, but not really worse, either.  If I'm in the area of Adler's and don't feel like driving in to Fitchburg, I'm not going to feel like I'm missing anything by getting them here.  This goes for most of their other dishes, as well.  The only disappointment I've had was the BBQ Pork Mac and Cheese.  This was something like $17, and for the price, there was way too little pork, and barbecue for that matter.  I appreciate that Madison's in the middle of dairy country and the focus is probably going to be on the cheese, but there's still at least one legitimately good barbecue place in Madison (Smoky Jon's), and there needs to be more than a smidgen of pork to call it BBQ Pork Mac and Cheese.  But all in all, I'd definitely recommend checking it out.  It's probably not going to be your favorite restaurant ever, but if you live in the area, it's a pretty nice place to go to every once in awhile."}
{"text":"Great food, great local tap beers. Started with appetizers of Bistro steak bites and cheese curds. As soon as the waitress  asked how we wanted the bites cooked, we knew we had a winner, and so tender. They came out in a red wine and Brandy reduction with and a half order of Crimini mushrooms on the side. Mushrooms and curds were perfectly battered and deep fried in a tempura-like batter so we could soak up all the juice...yum freakin yum. Had the flat iron Korean pork for dinner and opted for a cup of the homemade cream of sweet potato with chicken and wild rice. One of the best soups I've ever had (and I am not a sweet potato affectionado). Perfect blend of sweet and savory with a great mouthfeel of the chicken and wild rice. This spot is now forever in our radar for all future trips to Madtown."}
{"text":"Great lunch place! This is our regular lunch spot at work. Today, i enjoyed their soup and salad combo. French onion soup was exactly what i expected and garden salad was huge. This lunch special is endless soup/salad for $9.99, but i only had the one serving of each. The salad came with olives, cucumber, mushroom, grape tomatoes on a bed of romaine. I requested the house made raspberry vinaigrette. Yum! This dish, also came with two pieces of garlic bread. The bread was nothing to brag about, but a nice touch. I have also heard their dinner/bar menu is great, but i have not experienced because i do not live on this side of town."}
{"text":"Good service and better than average bar food.  Good place to bring a kid."}
{"text":"Ultimate grilled cheese.... yeah not so ultimate.  Soggy with two slices of cheese that was not completely melted.  Got the chili for the side, had a layer of grease that made it very unappealing, so I didn't touch it.  I will say it was great to have the food delivered to my door at the Hampton.  That being said, I won't order again from here."}
{"text":"There are 12 people at the bar spending money and it's 11pm----last call was called.  I took the last sip out of my beer and put the empty glass in the rail. The bartender never came back to ask if I wanted another beer. He called last call and didn't give the option of having another beer. It was last call and here's your tab. Not to mention, as a previous bar owner and bartender for 15 years, he started counting tips while everyone was still at the bar. Customer service is crap at best from the bartender. I came in with 2 other people and we haven't been here 1-1/2 hours and we are getting routed out. You've got paying customers, keep the joint open. Just saying. Thanks Jared and have a Merry Christmas!!!!"}
{"text":"I usually test a restaurant by getting the chicken Alfredo pasta.  A restaurant can make a great dish with mediocre ingredients, or it can make a marginally acceptable dish.  I recieved a basic, normal chicken Alfredo. My mother got the prime rib and it was food.   This is all OK except the price seemed high. I won't be going back soon."}
{"text":"Sweet temptations (see my review of it.), this is good! Blue gill is awesome. I tried this first a while back in 2011, I think. It lives up to its upscale-casual reputation. Rosemary chicken was good. Come if you get the chance."}
{"text":"i tried the Prime Rib sandwich.  It was tasty but seemed to be lacking a bit of seasoning and the bread was a rather thick so it consumed the juices of the prime rib.  I did enjoy their fries (I'm not normally a fry person) and their soup of the day was good.  I would come back and try another one of their dishes."}
{"text":"This is a perfectly reasonable place to go on a Friday night. It's not the kind of restaurant that has a lot of \"wow\" factor going on, but it's fine.  Our service was fast and friendly, even though the restaurant was very busy.    I had a pizza, which was tasty-good. Thin crust, kind of crispy, not soggy at all in the middle. Plenty of toppings too. My wife said there's too much sauce - that's how I like it so I was more than happy to not share with her.  Everyone else had the fish fry. I had a couple bites of the perch.  Crispy outside, moist on the inside. Nothing wrong with it at all.  They were freshly breaded and fried, unlike the crap that comes from a bag at some places just so they can say they do fish fry.  We came hungry and left happy.  Can't ask for much more than that."}
{"text":"This nice little place had very good food in a quiet atmosphere. You can either sit in a bar area or a dining area. We chose to sit in the dining area which was very quiet most likely because we beat the dinner rush. The food was excellent and we even had dessert. The prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Madison is a city full of restaurants of this type.  You know, the brushed nickel, beer garden, a dozen or so beers on tap, burgers-and-wraps kind of place.  But this place isn't bad.  For a quiet lunch on a Thursday there was a decent crowd, but we still got good service and a quick delivery of our meal.    So the burgers and wraps are good.  So is the beer selection.    I guess I could summarize this place as the type you wouldn't necessary think of going to, but wouldn't object when someone wants to come here."}
{"text":"Good food but a bit pricey. Need to keep the bar open later."}
{"text":"Adler's is a little pricy. However, I love their Saturday soup special and the endless soup and salad for $9.99. I would defintely go to Adler's if I were in the area but I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been delicious from the burgers to the pasta to the fish.  My husband likes their steaks and my mom raves about their soup.  My dad got their steak sandwich and that looked like something that would definitely be worth trying next time.  The appetizers were definitely large enough to split among a group of 4."}
{"text":"Great grouper sandwich.  A small restaurant.  Avoid the nachos.  Staff is friendly and took care of my nacho issue.  Reasonable prices.  Given that it is close to several hotels catering to business people, it was busy on a weeknight."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short and honest: RP Adler's is overpriced, cheaply decorated, poorly staffed, and populated by a fairly douchey crowd. The food is poor and drinks are mediocre. Bartenders are surly men aged 40+ with no employment options at a legit establishment and the waitstaff 30 and under hired for \"looks\" and nothing else. Ladies -- you're not that cute, trust me.  Cocktails are adequate at best. The food is poor -- just order one of their $9 burgers made from a pre-frozen patty you could buy at Copps for a quarter. On the whole, the place is a joke.  There are many other bars in west Madison. Even going to Chili's should provide you with  a better experience. Stay away."}
{"text":"Not bad for a meal right before the kitchen closed at 10 p.m. Pretty good service, too. We ordered the bistro steak bites and the grouper sandwich.  The bistro steak bites were fairly tasty, but the real gem? The beer battered crimini mushrooms. The horseradish sauce that came on the side, though, didn't taste very horseradish-y and had no kick to it.  The grouper sandwich was pretty standard. We got a side of coleslaw, which was decent as well. Nothing that made my taste buds sing, but still hit the spot.  We also got some of the house made hot sauce, which was nice and smoky -- with a little heat at the end. A good addition to our food.  Also, if you're sitting in the bar area, you'll be privy to some interesting conversations by fellow patrons at the bar. So listen up for some fascinating views on women and marriage!"}
{"text":"Food - very good Value - fair Service - can be hit or miss but generally good   Recommended: Thurs/Fri fish fry, Sat prime rib, and you *must* get an Old Fashioned   Definitely more fun to sit in bar/lounge if you like a lively crowd! The dining room almost seems like you're in a totally different restaurant."}
{"text":"I had a grilled fish wrap with mango today and it was wonderful! The service was excellent and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Mac and cheese with smoked ham is bland, soupy and left me unsatisfied. Mash potatoes are boring and dense.   Wish I would have made food at home."}
{"text":"From out of town and could walk here from the motel. It was so good the first night that I came a second night. And it was just as good. The first night I had shrimp in mushrooms with pasta and second night was grilled Cajun cod sandwich Both were excellent. Ask for Jennifer if you dine in the dining room. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Adler's is as average as it gets, but the good kind of average. I went in with low expectations, and came out satisfied but not blown away. I ordered the beer battered chicken fingers, and the Rueben. The chicken fingers were the best I have ever had. This is saying a lot, because common were talking about chicken fingers. The only other chicken fingers I can remember having are either from McCdonalds, the freezer section at Woodmans, or the time that I whipped up some beer batter and fried some chicken breasts in my Wok on my ex-girlfriends electric stove late at night after some beers. If you are a chicken fingers enthusiast, look no further. On the other hand if you are a Reuben aficionado, then stay home. The Reuben sucked. Pure and simple. The corned beef was over cooked, and was obviously frozen from its consistency. It was drowning in oil, obviously to compensate for its dryness. This only made for a funky tasting Reuben. Also the coffee left something to be desired. If it weren't for the amazing service that I received, I would have given this place two stars. Adler's is not meant to drop foodie panties. For a west side grill and bar, it is adequate. I will have to come back and try some more selections from the menu, and review again."}
{"text":"A friend and I had lunch at Adler's and we had a good experience over all.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  My friend had a grilled chicken salad and potato soup and she liked both.  I had the grilled salmon salad and was pleased that the salmon was still warm from the grill.  The citrus vinaigrette was fantastic. There was no bread offered with either salad.  A pretzel roll would be great.  I thought the portion sizes were smallish for the price and meets our previous experiences here in that the food and service are great but the prices seem high for you what you get, particularly the Friday night fish fry.  The dining room is nicely decorated and away from the bar, which is appreciated.  We would go to Adler's again."}
{"text":"This was a great bar and restaurant. My first visit here and I was impressed. The menu had a variety of food, and great vegetarian options! I got the Swiss and mushroom smash burger (a sweet potato patty). It came with seasoned fries which were delicious. We sat at the bar and watched football. The bar area of the restaurant is spacious with a casual setting. The bartender was very nice and gave us great service. It is a little pricy depending on what you order, not your bar like prices. But the food was great and different from any other greasy bar food you can get somewhere else. I would definitely recommend it for a chill lunch or dinner and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Sweet Potato soup was too sweet, like they added waaay too much sugar. For some reason the medallions were also too sweet. The Mac and cheese was way too salty. I'm going to guess that whomever is seasoning the food, smokes cigarettes. Maybe this is a great restaurants for those that can't taste food"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on the recommendation of my sister.  We were pretty happy with our meals.  I had fish and it was wonderfully done.  The price was a little bit more than I expected but reasonable because of how well done our food was. There is a lesson to be learned here for anyone that cares.  People are willing to pay a little bit more for a meal that is done right.  We think there are a lot of restaurants out there that need to hire a good chef. Great job at Adlers.  We plan to go back and see how some of their other entrees are. Ordered take out on a friday night.  Ordered the fish fry based upon another review.   Ok fish done well enough but nothing spectacular and rather skimpy in portion.  They say half pound but well, I would have liked twice as much.   The price was about double what it was worth.   We were really quite disappointed. I lower by two stars for this lousy meal."}
{"text":"I have to drop my review....in the past 6 months a friend and I have been twice and the fried food has become too greasy for either of our tastes.  The chicken tenders have somehow changed and they are too greasy and smaller.  The mozzarella sticks and fried fish hit the same too greasy note very recently.  I may give it another shot at some point."}
{"text":"Great service!  Very comfortable atmosphere.  Food was fine.  Nothing over the top outstanding but good and it was priced appropriately."}
{"text":"We've been greeted by a super friendly employee both times as soon as we entered this place. They've got unlimited free popcorn! Kind of a daytime bar atmosphere - casual, well-lit, bar food and happy hour. The batter they use on chicken tenders, frickles (fried pickles), etc. is AWESOME! It's the main reason we came back. Good place for hanging out with friends. Outdoor patio seating for the warmer months, too."}
{"text":"After finding my wedding dress I was told to come here for lunch. I had never been here before so I decided to check it out. I did like how private the booths were in the maiming dinning area. And that they had drink specials written in a black board upon enter the bar area. The nachos were pretty good, I forgot to ask for no jalapeños or black olives and those were hard to take off. My Grandma enjoyed her Ruben sandwich and I think my mom liked her very berry chicken salad. I was not overly impressed with the service but the quiet dinning area was great for chatting and wedding plans. Not sure I'd venture back."}
{"text":"Adler's is a nice place to go when you're looking for traditional fare, with a bit of a kick. I liked that you can find the old standbys on the menu, but they always make it their own.   The service was friendly and prompt. We had a few questions about some of the entrees and our hostess took the time to answer them, without heavy sighs, or eye rolls(always refreshing).  With our fish, we had a choice of home or french fries, steamed baby reds, or mashed sweet potato. I liked that it wasn't your traditional Wisconsin hash brown-french fry-baked potato trifecta. The french onion soup was good, but a bit salty.   I've also heard that the ribs and vegetable puff pastry are delish!  The owner, Randy is always there making sure every customer is satisfied!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Adler's on a semi-regular basis since we moved to Madison six years ago. At first we thought it was good food, slightly overpriced, questionable service, but they've made HUGE strides the past couple of years.   The flat iron pork is one of my favorite dishes in Madison and my wife loves the filet medallions (though she misses the sweet potato pasta). It's always a nice bonus when they have the sweet potato chicken rice soup, because that's pretty fantastic as well.   The service has also gotten much, much better. The owner clearly cares about his restaurant and I've gotten a couple of emails asking for additional feedback (and with gift certificates) because I took the time to fill out a comment card.   They have a nice reward program and they send out lots of coupons, so even if it is still a touch on the pricy side (15-20 for an entrée, you can usually cut some of the cost off). The food is worth full price now, and I wouldn't have always said that.   The beer battered chicken tenders are really good too, even if I miss the sweet potato chicken tenders they had a few years ago...."}
{"text":"I'm completely addicted to the chicken tenders with honey mustard dressing and hot sauce with a side of fries. I got that twice in the last month. I dream about them at night and I think my wife is starting to get jealous. I tell her it's carnal; I will hunt down the tenders and attack them like the wild man-beast I am."}
{"text":"Well,  I have a nice surprise to share. I walked in to grab a quick burger since it was late and it was across from my hotel etc. anyway, rather than turn this into another exercise in creative writing...I'll just get to it.   I was told by the bartender that the cod sandwich was excellent. I noticed they didn't have \"fish and chips\" on their menu however and I did remember how I thought their fried walleye diner was just \"ok\". I love walleye but way they did it was just ok.  Over fried, thick batter etc.   Anyway... I asked if in could get the cod sandwich as a \"fish and chip\" dinner and They obliged.   WOW!  Jack pot!!  This was some of the best fish and chips I've had on the road in the Midwest in quite some time. Three nice sized pieces, thin but nicely seasoned batter with a subtle crunch. Mind you, a 10 Minute walk with the fish in a sealed container will leave some moisture in the batter and it will soften the crunch a bit - that's on me.   Anyway - their fried cod is spot on - seriously. I may go back tonight and get it again. Living now in NM so good fish a chips are a rare find.   Brian if you read this... Add it to your list the next time your in Madison!!!    I'll edit this review to five stars once they add \"Fish and Chips\" to their menu.   Ok... So much for keeping this short"}
{"text":"This place is nothing special, but I was told they made a good burger.  My only downfall was to ask for it to be cooked medium, which by their standards is still pretty raw.  I think medium well would have provided a much better experience.   The fries were pretty greasy too, so this would not be on top of my list of places to return.   They seem to cater to an older crowd and the decor needs an update."}
{"text":"So my lovely wife and I were staying at the  Hampton Inn up the hill where we had stopped for the night just passing through Madison. We were tired and hungry so the lady at the front desk recommended RP Adlers because we could get a free drink there if we showed our room keys...that's all she needed to say. We showed up and ordered a couple beers, a decent list of drafts and bottles, nothing too exciting and planned on what were going to have for the evening. We decided to just have a couple apps or whatever and just pick at a few thing.  We started with the beer battered chicken fingers which came recommended. They were tasty but didn't leave me yearning for more. Next we opted for a salad trying to make ourselves feel healthy or something which was the same, no jumping for joy here. Lastly we wanted something to bring it home so we opted for the smoked pork mac n cheese. What a great combo this has to be good right? When it came out I was already disappointed due to the fact the macaroni was swimming in this cheese sauce. Don't get me wrong the sauce was good but I want to be able to eat my mac n cheese with a fork not a fishing line. Lucky for us the waitress brought over some extra bread to soak up the goodness. It was a relaxing place to enjoy a few beers, some sports, and some decent bar food"}
{"text":"One of my favorite non-chain places. Good food, quiet, plenty of space, friendly."}
{"text":"Update- I've now had 5 burgers, in search of a bit of beef; since I live out in the country, this is closest.  Every single one was raw to the point of barely thawed.  Disgusting.  Especially when I order them well done every time.  Never, ever going back."}
{"text":"Nice place but was a little crowded when I was there. Decent pub food.I would come back again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were staying across the street at Homewood.  We decided to give Adlers a try and really enjoyed it.  He had the Mac & Cheese with Pork and I had the Chicken pasta.  We both really enjoyed our meals and the wait staff was extremely friendly.  Thank you Adlers for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"We went there once and would never go back. There are too many good restaurants in Madison to waste your time here. My wife got the salmon and it was disgusting, I'm fairly certain it was frozen and simply reheated."}
{"text":"Some of the reviews on this site are obviously done by those who have an axe to grind.  We have been \"regulars\" at Adler's since it opened.  The food is always well prepared, well presented and one the rare occasion that something wasn't to my liking, I was given the opportunity to order something different.  (rare in other restaurants).  The waitstaff are not \"under 30's\" as another post implied.  They are mostly long-term, loyal employees of Adlers (including some male servers).    On a recent visit (last week) I had Adlers \"Roast Chicken salad\" and it was excellent.  In fact, it was more than i could eat.  The drinks are always well made and portion sizes are generous.    This is a great restaurant, with an owner that takes great pride in the establishment.  We will continue to go there and look forward to continuing to introduce it to our friends as a great, reasonably prices and family-friendly restaurant"}
{"text":"Adler's is an excellent place to have a good first date or hang out with friends.  Their fish fry is awesome especially the baked cod."}
{"text":"As far as food quality goes, this isn't the best you'll get in Madison but overall it's a good place to stop in at if you're on the west side. My husband and I especially love coming here to grab a drink and cheese curds! The loaded nachos are some of our friends' favorites."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for lunch with my family.  Thought I'd give it another try.  The food is pretty typical of the trendy pub/bar fare you find around in Madison.  Our food was pretty tasty but, portion sizes seemed skimpy for the price.  I had the pork loin special and the meat didn't even go out to the edges of the sandwich bread - which was just regular loaf style bread.  My wife had a salad with added chicken.  The size was on the small to medium side but, the cost for a simple Cesar Salad plus $3 for some chicken...wasn't quite there.  Sorry.  My son's burger was actually quite large and generous, in comparison.  Service has been fine when I've been here but, it has always been SO EMPTY!  This time we went right at the peak of lunch, expecting a crowd on the weekend - the location seems very good, next to major shopping areas.  We were the ONLY people in the bar side, and there were only a couple tables with guests on the dining side.  I can't say it was for bad food quality or service.  Both were good for us.  Had the portions been a little more generous, I'd have given them 4 stars."}
{"text":"I've got to give it a really mixed review. There were parts I really enjoyed, and parts I wish I could forget.   The atmosphere is really nice and cozy. Host/ess are friendly as are the servers. We were in after lunch so the place only had one other table.   Started off with the cheese curds, which are good. Not the best in Madison or anything, but I'd say they're better than most in the area nearby. I'm a picky little princess about my ranch dressing, and theirs is very good.   I got a cup of French onion soup with my meal. It was good, but honestly it was surprisingly sweet for my tastes. Husband loved it, and was more than happy to take it off my hands. I will say the cheese on top was gloriously browned and bubbly.   He got the sweet potato chicken wrap, and I got the crispy chicken tender sandwich. So the positives are that the crispy chicken was amazing and the fries were nice and crisp which I love. The downside to this was their \"Cranberry dijon mayo\". Ya'll, it's terrifying. I was super excited. I was like, \"Oh, I really like all these things, it'll be so freaking good.\" I was about as wrong in my theory as they are in serving this abomination. It's got the consistency of yogurt and tastes like frosting. It was a smack in the face of \"Wow, this is ridiculously sweet, what's going on?\". The worse sin is that it doesn't really taste like any one of the things in its name. I couldn't discern dijon or mayonnaise, and the cranberry was so sweet that I honestly thought it was raspberry.   So, I think I'd like to try them again for dinner, but if you take any one thing from this review, avoid that sauce. It's scary."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place.  One star is for the appetizers and one star is for our waitress,  Jordan.  We had the beer battered green beans and cheese curds for our appetizers. OMG, they were DELICIOUS.  Our main dishes consisted of personalnpizza, blackened cod sandwich, and Rachel ruben sandwich. The pizza was very obviously frozen. The bottom of the crust has the typical circle indents that are consistent of frozen pizza/crust. It was meh. The Rachel was so soggy that it was like chewing on a wet, sweaty gym rag. Gross. My dish was the cod sandwish. It was like bitting into a block of rosemary and fennel. I COULD NOT detect a flavor of fish or anything  else. It was basically like doing the cinnamon challenge  with rosemary and fennel. It was so bad that I sent it back which I never do. I mean, I have probably done that less than 3 times EVER in my LIFE.   Jordan our server was very apologetic and took it off our check.   I'll never eat here again. The food was sub par to put it nicely."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and was served by Courtney, great attentive service without hovering. Ordered the smoked turkey and Swiss and a salad.  Fresh salad w generous portion. Smoked turkey was juicy and full of flavor. No complaints here."}
{"text":"If you order tacos you expect tacos, not a burrito and to not be told that they take liberties to whether they serve you tacos or burritos.  I have never heard of a restaurant doing this and it only perpetuates bad stereotypes of people from Wisconsin.  A taco is a taco and a burrito is a burrito and they should know the difference."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food. I had the shrimp with mushroom pasta, and the portion size and taste was amazing. We shared cheese curds for an appetizer, and they make the top three I've had in madison. The waitress was very friendly and attentive, but the food was a little bit slow to be served."}
{"text":"I used to really like Adler's, but this is far more a restaurant than a bar. The bartenders will kick you out promptly at 11.   The food is pretty good though if you're looking for big portions."}
{"text":"Salads and pizzas were very good.  Rosemary chicken was a bust. Sounded great on the menu, but not much taste and the chicken appeared to the pre-cooked/grill marked stuff lower end diners use.  Our server is the only reason I am giving this establishment as many stars as I am."}
{"text":"Yummy food. I really like the salmon sandwich and bistro Bistro Filet Medallions."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and lots of choices.  Cheese curds and hummus appetizers were also great.  We would definitely come back next time we are in town."}
