{"text":"This place pretty wack. Came here after a really long morning to relax and get something to eat. I ordered the mother-shucker burger or whatever it's called. SPECIFICALLY said I wanted it well done and the whole thing was pink and disgusting. I didn't send it back, I just didn't wanna deal with it. But biting into it made me just feel so disgusted. Picture is taken when I brought it back in the leftover box. Also, the waiter was really really annoying. Like he wouldn't stop being nosy and asking us about the food like \"are you going to want boxes later?\" \"Do you want dessert??\" Chill bro"}
{"text":"Do not ever go too crab corner...go only to shucks..best oysters for the money...incredible. ....omg and best service"}
{"text":"Not cool. I have been here several times now and decided to take my daughter here for breakfast. Apparently they don't allow kids in here before 4pm because of some health code?? That's a little concerning... So I guess the only time to bring my 4 year old here is later in the day when it's full of drunks and smokers? I've only came here for drinks because the one time I ordered food, my burger didn't taste right and made me sick. Service has never impressed me, and I will Not be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Great spot, good price and daily specials. They make some of their own sauces; the house made dressing is good. The ceviche is better than most in Vegas... They do it with some honey Dijon  sauce and salsa; bomb, if ur down for different flavor combos."}
{"text":"If you don't go here,you are missing a real treat. They have many many customers, therefore fresh seafood. Oysters are small but seem to be fresh and delicious. Shrimp ceviche to die for. Crab fantastic, clams delicious, fish and chips great.
They won't honor gift cards from anyone, and must process you credit card twice for anything over $100.00 dollars. Manager is very belligerent. No help at all. Wrote Corporate they don't care either."}
{"text":"Whoa move over Joe's Crab Shack, Shuck's has been discovered. The first time I came here I wasn't sure about how the food would taste, but I am glad that I tried it anyway. I tried the lobster bites and the crab dip both delicious. 

The second time I came here I saw a couple that ordered this big shell of seafood which was the clam bake. So my bf and I ordered it since it seemed like it would be enough food to eat. Of course it was...it has clams, crab, corn, potatoes, and sausage! MmMmM just the sound of it makes my mouth water.  

Totally worth the place to go to eat some seafood and watch some games. Great location, clean, and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to try a new place and didn't want to travel far from flamingo and 215 area. We enlisted Yelp to help us find a place to dine at. Shucks came to mind. After reading all the reviews this seemed to be THE place the be! so we decided to give it at shot. 

When you walk in you see is the bar, we looked for a hostess but there's a sign to seat yourself. On the right hand side is the bar with some high top tables to sit at and on the left there are tables and booths restaurant style. We decided to sit at a booth with a large table because we were planning on eating a lot of food. We were greeted by the waiter and he gave us some time to look at the menu. 

There is a pretty good selection of seafood and other items such as sandwiches and pasta to choose from. My friend and I went for the seafood. We ordered 1/2 a dozen raw oysters on the shell, 1/2 lb of black mussels, 1/2 lb of manila clams, 1 lb of snow crab legs, garlic french fries, and a crab and spinach dip. seasonings for the seafood we choose lemon and garlic. 

The food didn't take too long to come out except for our garlic fries. First, came the crab and spinach dip. Consistency was different than what I'm used to. It was a little runny and had a strong sea food taste from the crab. I'm used to this dip being a little thicker and more creamy.  We had to add some hot sauce, salt and pepper to the appetizer so it wouldn't taste as bland. The chips that came with it were almost a cross between a tortilla and a pita bread. 
Next came the oysters. Those were delicious. White meat not cloudy and didn't smell fishy. Then the rest of our food arrived.

 Everything smelled so GOOD and mouth watering but when we started slurping and eating everything our noses deceived us. The food smelled so tasty and aromatic but it did not taste the same way. Weird right? I guess we are so used to eating at Hot 'n' Juicy. We finished our meal and I totally didn't even notice that our garlic fries never came out. We flagged down the waiter and asked them if they forgot it? He went to check and said the cooks forgot but it seemed like he forgot to ring it in. 

The fries came out about 5 minutes later super oily and shiny with some sort of garlic white powder on top of them. I didn't even want to eat it. I tried one and the moment I bit into it I felt like an oil bubble bursted into my mouth.

This place is nice and clean but the service was a little poor. They only had 2 table sitting in that area with 2 servers serving as well.  The price is good for what you get especially since it is seafood. 

So if you are looking for something close in the area with mediocore seafood. This will be the spot."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would, I have lived in Vegas for over a decade and never received service like this. Went in on June 14, 2017 @ 5:30 pm the male bartender on shift should be fired. He ignored me and my GF and attended to only regulars after ordering a beer, and not once asking for refills. After ordering dinner we didn't receive our order untill 45 min later (which was a salad, a wrap, a French fries) and in \"to-go\" bags when we never requested it. By that time a kind females bartender came on and asked him about us and our order seeing why it was \"to-go\" since we were at the bar where we ordered. The male bartender lied and said he never took our order. How a 50 year old bartender lies and acts like  a child is still beyond my belief. 
He did comp my beer because I gambled a little but his attitude and demeanor was atrocious and will be going on ever social media platform to complain about this experience. I have worked in customer service for years and don't expect red carpet service but to lie and be ignored for nothing is beyond my belief. I am more upset taking my time to write this but I could not bare this horrible service be unnoticed, I'd expect this from MC Donald's. Sorry but this place can go SHUCK itself."}
{"text":"I love this on saturday mornings with a hangover. The food is good and the crowd is family. I wish the oysters were bigger"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great breakfast for $4.99. I always get the crescent breakfast sandwich which is delicious."}
{"text":"Cheap quality bar food at a high price.  Service is hit or miss.  Place is ugly.  Will suffice if you are in a late night munchie bind. 2.3 stars"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I'm not a HUGE seafood fan, but the wife is, so we went to Shuck's (conveniently located about a minute or so from our house). 

At first it looks like most of the 24 hour gaming/dining establishments in the area, but I wasn't really expected a fancy sit-down place, so I don't mark it down for appearance. 

It should also be noted that this is a Chicago Bears bar for the Sunday NFL games, so any of our Chicago implants here in Vegas might find some joy in hanging out with other Chicagoans.

I got the Chicken Club and some waffle fries which was very good and very filling and pretty cheap (about $8.95). My wife got the 2 and a half pound bucket of Snow Crab Legs which seems expensive ($32) but the meat was pletinful and very good and like I said, I don't eat too much seafood. 

They bring out all the proper equipment for breaking your legs and wet-naps for cleaning up afterward. So points there for being thorough. 

The waitress was not super attentive, and it seemed like they had just one woman working the entire restaurant and bar area. I know it was a Tuesday night, but there were a lot of people in there, you'd think they'd have a second server. 

All in all, Shuck's is who I thought they were (that's a Bears/Dennis Green reference for you football fans). 

It's a good place to go if you're looking for a better than average meal at a reasonable price (with the exception of the crab bucket). We'll go again, just probably not every night."}
{"text":"Shucks..a bit disappointed, last night I took family for the first time hoping to have the same experience as we did for about 10 times. The Clam Bake was the reason we always go on a Sat to have the $5 off, found that it wasn't anymore...crabs was an added option and you had to pay extra for it. It was still tasty but we should have gone to a buffet for the price we paid...It was still tasty though...Sadly..Shucks is now not on the top of my list..for value as the prices went up immensely..."}
{"text":"For a restaurant/bar type dive, I think this place is great! I always have great and friendly service whether I'm sitting at the bar or in the restaurant side. I personally am not a huge fan of seafood but I enjoyed most of what they have to offer. The bacon wrapped shrimp was good just not very much for an appetizer! The prices are very cheap in my opinion. This is my favorite dive in the area based on food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place today. Haven't had oysters since leaving Washington state. Food was great, oysters were fresh, oyster shooters were delicious. Only downside was the service. Waiter was pretty slow."}
{"text":"We love this place for BREAKFAST of all things.  They have a great menu and the food and service are always impeccable.  By far one of the best sit-down breakfast spots in Vegas.  There's never a line, even on Sundays, most likely because it's still a best-kept secret.  When a friend told me what great breakfasts they served, I was shocked because it's definitely not the first place I would think of for Sunday breakfast.  Chicken fried steak and eggs for $4.99....simply awesome!!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a bar near home that serves food. I checked Yelp for this non-descript looking place with a cute name that I'd seen whenever I'd been to the shopping sector across the street. I was surprised to see all the good reviews, so we gave it a whirl. I just had a few beers (nice selection on tap) and the fried oysters. Delicious! Even the cole slaw was great. Everything about the place was SO much better than the boring old big chain corporate places with homogeneously stodgy fare. Everything except, that is, the smoking. I recently quit smoking so can appreciate that smokers enjoy smoking indoors, but I now find it rather unpleasant and have no idea how my friends put up with my stinkiness for so long (I must be really, really cool or something). Anyhow (I think I've just digressed...sorry!), the smoking is the only drawback I've found to this place. 
Excellent quality food at a very reasonable price with good service, good atmosphere, and plenty of booze...what more could a cool girl like me ask for?! Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Well, I dine out tree to four times a week, this place is alright, quality of food is ok,  and so is the menu.  If you are looking for an enironment to hang out with friends this place will be ideal not for a quiet night out.  Place is clean, and the food quality is your tipical tavern food for the most part.  I ordered some Rockerfeller oysters they never arrived."}
{"text":"OMG... Ok. ... so if you love oysters this is definitely the place to eat at. I ordered 2 dozen Oysters. ..an order of garlic fries...that were so delicious they were to die for. If you like to drink... the bartender definitely hooks it up with a very generous amount of liquor...so this place hands down is a MUST eat at. Jackie and Ashley were awesome with the customer service which is rare in Vegas. I will definitely become a regular because of the great customer friendly service both the girls gave and the awesome taste of the fresh quality of the oysters. By the way they serve em up 24 hours and on Thursday oysters are $1 each ....yes... one dollar each oyster on thursdays."}
{"text":"I really enjoy getting seafood here and watching games at the bar.  I usually order off of their \"special\" menu that presents a better deal than just ordering off their regular menu.  Shimp and crab legs.  Fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good sea food at good prices, this is NOT the place for you. This place was disappointing.  The clam bake lacked...everything and costs a lot. Had I not added crab, I'm not sure what I would've eaten. The waffle fries were good, but you can get very similar ones at your nearest fast food restaurant. The service was slow and awkward. I'll probably go home and have a bowl of cereal...if you have a hankering for sea food, going to this place will surely take it away from you. We will never go back."}
{"text":"A group of 5 of us tried this and we were pleasantly surprised. Nothing fancy to look at and a bit smokey in the bar area but in the restaurant not bad. The food was really good and in large servings. We had jambalaya that was pretty spicy but good, seafood tacos, steak and shrimp, linguini and clams and a shrimp, crab and lobster Louie. Not a complaint in this group of critical eaters. Even two of us went back for breakfast and enjoyed it completely. A definite do again. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This place....good as fuck. 

Well hell, the shit is open 24 Hours and late night like past 2am there aren't any Vegas weirdos being weird. The bar tender is cooooooool and make drinks all tasty n shit. He also doesn't try to talk your goddamn head off like some places. The man does his job and does it with awesomeness and that's it. Seafood be good as fuck man, like shit where else can you have oysters, catfish, gumbo and shit at that hour? No where. Plus it's on a good side of town so get that ass up in there and get me a drink, I'll be on the way."}
{"text":"Truly, this place is our favorite everyday local eatery! 
A little background for a moment: I DO NOT eat fish. In fact, I hate fish. Closest thing I'll eat is popcorn shrimp lol. While I must say the popcorn shrimp is fantastic at Shucks, if I didn't want that or chicken tenders-which are also some of the best I've had- I found the rest of the menu (non fish items) to be mediocre. My husband on the other hand LOVES fish and crab, especially crab. He fell in love with the prices, quality, and large options available on the menu immediately while I was- sad to say- a harder sell. 

Recently they added new menu items and seem to have revamped the current menu as well with it and now I'm asking him to go to Shucks! I'm addicted to the chicken mac and cheese. It's always so fresh and tastey. And I also am very fond of the fried chicken sandwich and BBQ chicken salad. We can go out to eat quite often sometimes and with the recent new menu we're finding ourselves here pretty regularly. The staff is beginning to know us (can't imagine why! Lol) and we always get great service despite coming in at various times of the day and night. Sitting at the bar or dining room has never hindered service or quality for us. 

The atmosphere is a little dive-y but comfortable, casual, and not intimidating. I can't say much regarding their cocktails as we have only tried two: the Adios Shucker and Crab Walk. We always order one or both of those so you can say we like them a lot. 

PS- DESSERT TRAY. That is all."}
{"text":"Place is a bar with seating on the side, typical dinner tables and booths. Seafood was definitely frozen, not fresh, but prepared fine. Lots of specials, cheap drafts, if you go mid week when its not busy it is a pleasant enough atmosphere. Service was on par, its also a bar so expect a waitress who is doing multiple things at once.
Gf loved her shrimp pasta.
Probably wouldn't return, try someplace better next time"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this location while searching for a late night restaurant for my after wedding dinner for 30 people! From the initial phone call they were so very accommodating, I was actually skeptical because they were so nice!! Everything was AMAZING - from the service to the food! This is definitely a place we will be frequenting, all of my guests were surprised at the quality of the food for the price. Thank you Shucks for making my special night that much better!"}
{"text":"I was huge fan of Shucks however, I was informed this morning that Shucks Tavern & Oyster Bar on N Durango is openly discriminating against military combat veterans and wounded warriors by denying them service and throwing them out of the establishment.  The Shucks management at this establishment openly calls out and accuses veteran customers as representing \"Stolen Valor\" and immediately kicks them out of the place while the veterans are enjoying their meals or beverages that they paid for.  This behavior will not be tolerated by Veterans and Military action groups in Las Vegas NV nor anywhere else around the country.  Believe me veterans actions groups are going to be outraged at this company.  So in my opinion, if you are a military family member, active duty, National Guard, Reserves, a veteran or a wonder warrior consider boycotting all Shucks Tavern & Oyster Bar establishments and I recommend you stay away from them!  Shucks Sucks!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic!.. We had so much to eat! Love my seafood.. Staff was friendly. The women's restroom are disgusting! There's vomit on the doors! Never will I ever return because of that reason."}
{"text":"The best place ever! The beer selection is awesome, the food is great, and the service is wonderful. It's close to my house and I go often. Nikki is my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place, but the service is so hit and miss. I've been there twice, when it's not even that busy, and my drink glass if empty forever. I'd have to go out of my way to ask for a refill. 

Likewise the food is pretty darn good for the price, but again the consistency is hit/miss. For instance I had a great sirloin on a prior visit, but on subsequent tries they never could cook it right. I ordered medium rare and it came out well done, as did the recook the second time. I just ate my vegetables and called it a night. (They did take it off my bill though.) 

Also noticed that the last time was very smokey, while the previous visits were not bothersome at all. This probably has something to do with the ventilation system at the time. 

They do have great hamburgers though, which are hard to screw up. So I might try them again."}
{"text":"This is the best late place I've been to for food in Vegas. My wife and I had just left The Ainsworth Lounge at Hard Rock Hotel and we were very hungry and it was around 1am. My wife and I really had a taste for some sushi but any kind of seafood would do. We started yelping trying to find the closest place to our home and low and behold Shucks had great reviews the only problem was that they didn't sell Sushi, we figured lets try it anyways because oysters would suffice.

We arrive at Shucks park there were more than 8 cars in the parking lot and they had a two sets of double doors. We'd walked through the first set of doors and found that we had to ring a doorbell to get into this establishment. That was a bummer because after ringing the doorbell and waiting literally waiting about a minute I told my wife lets go, I can be very impatient and I thought that at the Sedona the kitchen was open 24hrs but to my surprise it wasn't. After arriving at the Sedona finding out that the kitchen is no longer 24hrs the bartender at the Sedona suggested that we go back to Shucks. We gladly took his advice and returned. 

Arriving back at Shucks we rang the doorbell and we were in less than 10 seconds."}
{"text":"Worst experience of my life!! Wouldn't waste my TIME on these people or place that's been closed at other locations . 

Nuff said!?"}
{"text":"Kind of skeptical when I went here with the parents. The food was pretty good. Fried food done at its best and the Caesar dressing had a lot of lemon juice in it which is my favorite. Our order kind of lagged but I have nothing else to complain about...It's 24 hours and its not denny's"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant! Been here 3 times in the last two weeks and then never let us down will keep coming back! Fast service and delicious food at a great price!"}
{"text":"WTF ARE YALL SELLING???!!! Like seriously. Miss me with these under the ocean floor, rotten belly, steroid-like dungeon oysters. I cut these big ass things in half and the stomach oozed some nasty yellow and green 2 second later super unbearably funky smelling slime! Almost instantly threw up! Yeah, this ones a HELL TO THE NAH for me Randy!"}
{"text":"I went down to pick up an order to go, the food was not ready when expected so I took a seat at the bar and ordered a glass of wine. Very local atmosphere but customers and bartenders were telling dirty jokes with the language to match. It was enough to make me uncomfortable.....The food was OK but I will not return. Not a family friendly place."}
{"text":"A little smokey at times, but the food is good and service is great.  Definitely a neighborhood favorite!"}
{"text":"When I first moved to the area, my roommate and I decided to go out for dinner.  He prefers chains.  I don't.  We settled on Shuck's.  Shuck's is a local chain consisting of three restaurants.  They have tremendous seafood, as well as sandwiches and meat.  

I have been multiple times and I always am drawn to the clam chowder.  I also love the clam bake, and my favorite salad is the Shuck's Salad, consisting of Mesclun, a crableg, shrimp, and seared tuna.

Service is attentive and friendly.  If you are lucky enough to get Sonny, she is an amazing waitress."}
{"text":"Ive been here twice in the last 3 weeks and ordered catfish both times.  Love the cornmeal crust.  Light and crispy and perfectly seasoned.  Fries are solid, just not a lot of them and I didnt try the coleslaw.  Service was attentive and friendly.  I'll be back for more catfish!"}
{"text":"Been going here for the past year and it's always been a great time. I'm in the industry so I only show up on the graveyard shift. Larry is always attentive and offers great recomendations. Im a fan of his and the bar for sure!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Crab anytime of the day for a good price. They're menu items are delicious and drinks are pretty good. I go here more than anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Yummy chicken fingers and fries!! Good service and cheap prices. Can't go wrong for a late night meal :)"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would!! This was the worst experience EVER!! Being in the service industry I usually put up with a lot and give the bartender a break but he was seriously the worst bartender in the world!! As soon as we walked in we were completely ignored and treated like nothing. There were only 9 people in the bar including us, so not busy what so ever. We looked over the menu for a few minutes ordered a salad and sandwich and seriously waited over 40 minutes for our food!!!!! The couple that came in after us ate and left by time we received our food! Instead of telling us our food was taking awhile or checking in on us the bartender completely ignored us and wouldn't even refill our drink, he dodged us wouldn't make eye contact. When we received our food it was luke warm and tasteless but we decided to eat it cause we were starving. When I asked if the food usually takes 40 minutes he said yeah at night it always does if we're busy...THERE WERE 9 PEOPLE IN THE BAR!!!! YOU'RE NOT BUSY!! He rolled his eyes and acted like I was asking a stupid question. I asked for the check and he said he took care of it, but at this point I would of rather paid the check and stiffed him. Don't act like a douche bag and then expect the world cause you decided to take care of something because you should of at the beginning. You're graveyard bartender is a prick and shouldn't treat locals like shit in a local bar! Seriously I will tell everyone not to come here!!"}
{"text":"Centennial Hills is a gastronomical wasteland.As a result with few decent places to chose from, Shucks becomes a standout. Keep it simple and basic. Their soup especially the Lobster Bisque is quite good. So is the clam chowder. Burgers are good too. I also am fond of the quesadilla.Entrees are a bit pricey so I would not recommend them. Salads especially the black and bleu.This Salad with bleu cheese crumbles and plenty of slices of steak, prepared the way you like it, perhaps is the best menu choice."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. I been to this place a few tines and have always been treated like crap. Last night was it for me. The bartender/waiter was rude and cursing at us from across the way because we asked for hot butter. Dont know why a place wld want to turn away money. When we have done nothing wrong. And was completely ignored the whole time. He checked on everyone around us and just walked past us like we were not there at all from the moment we walked in the door."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite sea food place! Their new menu is just amazing. The crew is nice, the food is good! We love coming here!"}
{"text":"The food is okay. My biggest complaint is the fact that the restaurant and bar area are attached. There is supposed to be no smoking since its considered a family establishment. But I went there at around 8:00 for dinner people at the bar were smoking and the staff said nothing. It totally ruined my experience and I wreaked of cigarettes when I left. 
However, if you're a smoker you might really like the place."}
{"text":"Super high quality shellfish.  The oysters were fantastic, cold peel and eat shrimp was perfect (including the temp, not too cold), and the bacon wrapped shrimp with a glaze was out of this world.  The food comes out fast so order in waves so you have time to enjoy your cold beer!"}
{"text":"Food was horrible my husbands fish wasn't all the way done. Oryster shots was horrible for the price not worth it. This is my first and last time going to shucks tavern on Durango. Not to mention we kept having to wave down there server"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place. I go here every Tuesday night. The wait staff is pretty good. They have their on and off days (sometimes seem annoyed to serve you and other times they love you), but the food is CHEAP and SSUUPPEERR good! The buffalo chicken fingers and fires are to die for. I literally look forward to it ALL WEEK LONG. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great place for late night food. It's to only place in the area for good seafood & drinks after work. Larry the graveyard bartender makes us feel welcome we will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely great place!  Open 24 hours, so even when I'm working strange hours I can always stop in for a beer.  It's got video poker if that's your thing but I usually come with work friends to decompress.  Not only is it one of the very few 24/7 places out here in this neighborhood, it's FANTASTIC!  Usually have to choose one or the other.  Never knew it existed until a friend showed me, and I've been missing out!  Service is friendly and helpful, the barkeeps are familiar with even infrequent customers, and the food is bomb.  Try the seafood chowder!  It's incredibly delicious!"}
{"text":"We started of with the $5 apps. The crab dip was good  decent amount of crab flavor and creamy, the clam strips were bigger then the stuff you get at long john silver, and the calamari was solid.  The oyster po boy was alright about  4 oysters in a hoagie roll , lettuce ,tom and tartar sauce no wow factor just alright. I would come back prices reasonable."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here and both times have been great service. I'll keep it simple and only do this time's review. 

You seat yourself. And it is a bit dark here. (I like coming for breakfast though so its kinda funky being dark) 

Our waiter was the same both times. Super tall nice guy. 

He let us order breakfast (it was ending in ten minutes I believe)

He's very nice. My other half ordered steak and eggs. Our waiter asked how he would like it cooked and he said \"scrambled\" (not realizing he meant the steak) we all laughed. He's got a good sense of humor. Not afraid to joke. 


And the food is great and cheap! Two people we paid like $16 for two breakfasts! Yesterday at cracked egg (which I love) we paid $40"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night to have a bite to eat.  I guess the football game had just ended and this place was a ghost town.  I thought it would still be full of people having drinks and hanging out, but I guess I was wrong.  

We seated ourselves over by the bar area and it took a couple minutes for the server to come over and take our order.  We ordered a couple beers and the fish tacos, steak salad and a cup of seafood bisque.

The seafood bisque was super salty!  I wanted to take it home and mix it with canned soup to dilute it.  

The fried fish tacos were actually pretty large and filling, and the flavor was good being not too dry and not too fishy.

The steak salad was good except for having too much bleu cheese.  Luckily we asked for the dressing on the side or else the flavor would have been too overwhelming.  The steak was seared and cooked almost like tartare which we liked.  But the rest of the salad was unremarkable in my opinion.

Next time I will come back to try oysters in some form, be it raw or rockefellar.  Maybe during a football game where they have discounts on food and drinks."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I frequent this spot because I LOVE seafood, and it's a cool little place to unwind after a long day. I always bring a friend or two, sit at the bar, have some beer/ wine and order a bunch of oysters 

The great thing is that they also have a bunch of delicious crab, lobster, mussels, shrimp, etc. Yay! I always get to try something new when I'm here."}
{"text":"Great palce to come for Raw Oysters and a cold beer, especially on a Sunday for NFL games! The Clam bake is large and will surely satisify your craving for shell fish! 

Laid back atmosphere-- nothing too fancy, yet not a hole in the wall either."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love this place along with most of our family... peel and eat shrimp are awesome ...let alone the price ...we love to come for there breakfast when we are too lazy to cook... brought my niece for breakfast for her b day n she loved it !! We also love the fact that it's smoke free and kid friendly as a mater of fact me and my fiancé are heading there for dinner once she's off work :)"}
{"text":"Great menu and delicious food. Nice atmosphere. We like coming here for a relaxing meal. my wife LOVES the coconut shrimp, I love the fresh fish choices. All the food comes hot and tasty."}
{"text":"BEWARE THE GRAVEYARD MENU.  Typically I have a great meal and time at shucks. living close by I have been there quite a few times. Last night a buddy and I shared some fried clam strips and peel and eat shrimp. When the clams arrived the first thing I thought was \"what the hell is this?\" I have never seen clams that were almost 5 inches long. Was very unsettling, but I thought to myself, \"who am I? I don't know if maybe these are different from every other clam I've eaten, so what the heck\" tasted OK, were very chewy, I still wasn't convinced these were actual clams, but kept eating.  About 5 hours later I woke up with stomach cramps, proceeded to vomit all of the food I had eaten, and dry heaved for another hour or so while I began to become feverish. I lost a day of work and needless to say they have lost a customer.

The plus side of the story is that my buddy did not get sick, I checked with him but apparently he did some heavy drinking afterwards so not sure if that affected his toxicity levels."}
{"text":"Best bar food ever.
Reason for 4 and not 5 stars is it depends upon the staff.
If Darby is bartending, the drinks will never be empty and the food will not sit in the window drying out. The man knows his sh*t and cares about his patrons.
We all know this, so if the parking lot is packed he's probably working.. if it's empty you may wanna think twice lol.  I will sometimes call to see who's working.
Cooks vary from 4star restaurant awesome to \"dude really? did you even rinse these oysters before you shucked them?'... but for the most part food is awesome, low priced and I love coming here."}
{"text":"Best place to get your fix for crab, always friendly welcome"}
{"text":"The only reason I don't give them 1 star was because the food is decent (especially the breakfast) but as far a service goes for the dinning room it's terrible. The servers are not welcoming at all and act like we are impeding on their day. This place used to be a great place to bring the kids for meals, but not anymore. They only have 2 high chair for the entire restaurant and when you bring kids in somewhere its best to serve them first (drinks and all). Everyone at my table got drinks and my almost 2 year old was the last one served. Not happy with the experience at all!!"}
{"text":"Tough to review this place

The service has always been terrible. The food quality always amazing.

Dark and dingy is it a seafood place , a dive bar , late night hang out, or gaming spot.

The staff is always running around looking like it's their first day on the job. I have been seated and waited twenty minutes before acknowledged. And that was because i passed out from hunger

The waiter seemed stressed and didn't want our table or order. The manager seemed perplexed by it all and the ambiance was loud and fun. It's unfortunate that it always seemed like amateur hour because the food is so darn good

Don't think I have ever had a bad meal. The peel and eat shrimp is to die for. 

The happy hour seemed to change from my visits. One time I was allowed to order food Togo one time I wasn't on happy hour. The drinks are comped if your playing the machines which is nice and the bar staff had always been friendly. 

For the area and late night food it is some of the best around. If you can have a few beers ( if you can get them ) and not stress about service you will enjoy yourseld"}
{"text":"Recently moved to NW Las Vegas and have been checking out the neighborhood restaurants and taverns. Shucks quickly became a favorite after we had 2 dinners, a lunch, and several breakfasts. Joenna is our restaurant favorite server and ???our favorite bartender. (So sorry we don't know...gorgeous with long dark hair in ponytail..........worked until 3:30 or 4 pm today ( NCAA Gonzaga v S. Carolina [april 1]. 

Went to Shucks to see game and enjoy the atmosphere. So disappointing......the food and the later bar service. Food: ordered basic cheese nachos. Had to ask for guacamole and sour cream that came with them. $7.95 Nachos were soggy and stale. We just thought that was a lesson to us not to order appetizers. Later, ordered the $25.95 \"build your own order\". Being shrimp lovers, We ordered cocktail shrimp, popcorn shrimp, coconut shrimp and the peel and eat shrimp. (We had previously ordered the coconut shrimp and popcorn shrimp as entrees during another visit.)

Wow, how disappointing. 10 small popcorn shrimp supposedly equaled 1/2 pound. The cocktail shrimp were the same as the peel and eat.....mushy and miserable. We sent them back, requesting more coconut or popcorn shrimp. Frankly, I believe the cook peeled 4 of the shrimp we sent back and deep fried them...no resemblance to the first portion of coconut shrimp. Truly angered me. 

Additionally, we sat at the bar with empty glasses waiting for someone (of the 3 bar staff) to notice. We are well dressed, well behaved adults, and the bar was not very busy. 

We left. Will we go back? Can't tell you...we're home watching Oregon win, in comfort."}
{"text":"This place used to be good. Now quality is horrible. Let's go. Step it up. Went there excited left there disappointed. 1 star"}
{"text":"Great spot to just stop in and get some pretty good food at any time of the day. Beer is nice and cold and they have great specials.  If you sign up for their email listings they will send you the weekly specials with free play.  Great food, great service."}
{"text":"i expected a lot better food considering the other reviews. I ordered the fried oysters and the fish and chips. Both were bad, bad, bad. The oysters were not pan fried, rather deep fried and cooked so hard they literally broke into pieces under the fork. The color was way too dark meaning they were overcooked. The fish was cooked so hard I needed to work the knife hard to cut it open and it split in pieces. The breading was not fluffy like one expects from a beer bar. It was a rock hard shell. I believe they just took frozen factory  made fish planks and threw them into the oil. The fish was billed as cod but it was so dry and stringy I couldn't tell what it was. True, one could say, \"what would you expect from an oyster bar in the middle of a the Las Vegas desert?\"  Well. I'd expect at least to find good tarter sauce. Nope, it was like cheap mayonnaise with pickle relish thrown in. 

The mark of a good place is their pride in food and service. Insult was added to injury when I complained about the quality to my waiter, Gregory. I stated my dissatisfaction in an obtuse manner just to see what effect it would have. I told him that now I have something to write about. He said,\"what?\" I said, \"how bad the food is here.\" Without a comment, he turned to take my credit card to the register. I paid for the meal at full price. I was never asked any questions nor introduced to the manager. I will never go there again and recommend against this place to anyone else."}
{"text":"Went there with friends for lunch. Two of us ordered coconut shrimp. When it came the coconut was burned. It was a big disappoint. The others were not that happy with their food either. Shucks has been removed as a lunch spot for us."}
{"text":"Great chicken fingers and there 75 cents a piece  on Monday.  Loved them

The beer is great too"}
{"text":"The Oyster bake (Rockafeller)   is the ONLY way oysters should be ate. 100% perfection life will nvr be the same"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The wait staff is very attentive and friendly! The food is tasty and the prices are very reasonable! I have absolutely zero complaints!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for cheap, convenient shellfish.  I'd highly recommend one of the enormous clambakes that comes with snow and dungeness crab, corn, potatoes, and clams which are served in an embarassingly huge clam shell bowl.  Before going, make sure you print  coupons off their website for $5 off the clambake or 6 free oysters (if you spend $20).  

I'm also a fan because they're not stingy with the whiskey.  Their drink prices may be higher than some other nearby spots, but you can get some stroonnng drinks.

Beware: If you hate the Cowboys, this place is not for you."}
{"text":"Love this place. The lobster fingers are beyond good. The beer is cold and the drinks actually have alcohol. I'd say this place has delectable breakfast, lunch and dinner. The slots are lucky and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat at Shucks at least 1-2 times each week. We have had many breakfasts, lunches, and dinners at Shucks. The breakfast menu is not only fantastic, but it is no more expensive than having fast food. They are great about allowing substitutions such as egg whites for eggs and cottage cheese or tomatoes instead of potatoes. They even allow my husband to have seared ahi on his Eggs Benedict instead of ham for a small extra charge.

We love the ahi wraps and fish tacos for lunch! Also, pay attention to the daily specials as you walk in the door because there are some really great deals.

We also sometimes just order a selection of appetizers and share them. They have great appetizers and we really love the calamari.

Of course, the drinks are great too! I recently discovered their Maui Mosa and I am definitely a fan.

We have never had any issues with service and it is nice to see familiar staff every time we go.

We will continue to be regular customers at Shucks!"}
{"text":"My husband loves oysters. So we gave it a try. Not a ton of tables. So this can be tricky if going in with little ones and can't sit at the bar. The food was really good. It came out quickly and was yummy."}
{"text":"Nickolas was our server when we sat in the bar area a few nights ago! He was great! The food was good too, and very reasonably priced. Got a huge bowl of clam chowder for $3.99 and my friend got two giant glasses of vodka press for $10!! Can't beat that really!! The garbage salad with dill dressing was the bomb and clams in white wine sauce was super good too. Didn't care much for the tuna tartare but oh well everything else was great!!"}
{"text":"For $3.95 the breakfasts here can't be beaten.  There's around 12 selections... and they're all $3.95!

Everything arrives hot and cooked to order.  Coffee ($2.50) is good and not oily (a pet peeve of mine, I must admit)... although you'll smile that your drink cost more than half what your breakfast cost!

For lunch / dinner, the clam chowder and the fish and chips didn't disappoint.  Again, hot food prepared well.  It's hard to argue with simple dishes done well!

It's kinda smoky smelling when you first walk in through the door -- the lingering ghost of pre-ban times -- but don't let that put you off to trying this place out.  We used to be a fan of Joey's for FnC, but this place has really won us over by serving better tasting fare."}
{"text":"Great food. Horrible service.  The hostess is unfriendly and tonight we had the worst waiter.  I will be back but only for the food."}
{"text":"Great food great service. The shrimp nachos are phenomenal. The back and blue salad is also great."}
{"text":"We were kinda of skeptical since it's seafood in Vegas, but this place did not disappoint. We will be back soon for more. There is so many different options to choose from that 1 night of eating wasn't enough."}
{"text":"Went for the oysters--- weren't looking for a special---- they were great! 18 bucks for a dozen--- 
Sever cold l, good flavor, spicy horseradish! Will definitely return---- 
Bacon wrapped shrimp was so-so-- kinda chewy-- but now horrible-- probly won't get that next time--- but the oysters made up for it!"}
{"text":"We went to Shucks for the first time yesterday for breakfast.The food was delicious! My husband had the crab and lobster omelette and it was sooooo good! The prices are great and the service was great! We will definitely be going back :)"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas hands down. The service is consistent and friendly, the food is very reasonably priced, and the portions are neither overwhelming or leaving you wanting. We have breakfast at Shuck's 2-3 times a week and we LOVE it. It's the best way to start your day."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I discovered the little gem a few months ago.  We went the first time and it simply wasn't memorable.  The 2nd time with my parents was better.  But somehow the 3rd time we tried it we just fell in LOVE.  Its down the street from us so that makes it even better.  My man loves crab legs and theirs are amazing!  We come here about 2-3 times a month.  Yes its that good.  We simply order the same thing because hey if its not broken...(you know the rest)
Start off with the chips and salsa.  For the main course: 1 pound of crab legs seasoned with lemon pepper.  
The servers are awesome!  We pretty much have the same server each time.  Hey Vivian girl!

Other honorable mentions: crawfish, chicken tenders."}
{"text":"This is hands down the most underrated breakfast spot in town. I'm a regular customer and would highly recommend Shucks for breakfast. You can literally have a great meal for $5. Service is always good and quick which makes it even better."}
{"text":"Excellent food! It was our first time eating here last night. We sat in the dining area, so I cannot comment on the bar. The server was nice and kept checking on us, and filled my tea before it was even half empty. The place was nice and clean and smelled great! Our food didn't take too long to come out, and we tried lots of seafood! Between the scallops, clams, mussels, oysters, and calamari, we couldn't decide what was best! This is our new favorite place, and will definitely be back with our whole family!! Whoever the cook was last night is an excellent chef! Thank you Shucks!"}
{"text":"We used to go to Shucks pretty regular but the service got pretty iffy so we took a break. We decided to give it a try this past Tuesday night. We brought our 15 year old Grandson with us. We walked in, the sign said to seat yourself which we did. 1st a young girl walked out of the kitchen looked at us & giggled & went back in. a couple seconds later another young girl walked out of the kitchen looks at us giggles & goes back in. Now that we are a little weirded out another young lady walks to our table & tells us sorry we can't allow kids in here because they are having an issue with the health department because of smoking in their restaurant. Well it was nice of them  to embarrass us, would of been helpful if they either put a sign on the door or where you walk in near the sign that says seat your self. we could have done without the 2 immature girls giggling at us. Won't be going there or recommending this place anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed last Thursday night with my visit.  I hadnt been here for 4 years, use to come about 1 time a month late night.  Always quite but the food was a bit pricy for the quality.  I always ordered a steak - not a seafood lover like my ex.  Lately they have had a full lot quite a bit and thought why not try it again.  Really geared for sports and gaming with less expensive food gimics to bring you in.  Not impressed.  Service had gone down and clientle too.  Not anywhere to bring the family.   If you like gambling and sports its the place to go.  Shell fish my friend said is worth the price but not the drive."}
{"text":"Came here after an evening of ice skating. It was a Friday night and still relatively quiet. The place is pretty cute (themed) and the bar area is roomy so I imagine there would still be a good amount of space even if it had been crowded. My friend and I had gotten a coupon off the restaurant's site ($27.95 for dinner for two). The food was pretty good; however, our server was kind of a jerk (making sarcastic comments and being condescending). He was also a bit slow and forgetful even though there were only a handful of full tables and a few other servers working. So even with a good dinner, the uncomfortable service is making me question if I'd go back."}
{"text":"Great food, but the place is so dirty that I may not come back.  When they bus the tables, all they do is wipe down the tables.  The menus were sticky and filthy....the ketchup, malt vinegar and hot sauce bottles were filthy.  It's a hide turn off when the menu is so nasty.  It's too bad too, because the food is great.  Too bad the place is so dirty.  It wasn't just our table either.  I looked at other tables and they all had filthy condiment bottles.  It's an easy fix by management.  I hope they consider stepping up their cleanliness.

I appreciate the response from Schucks, and I will give it another shot. Like I said, the food was great.

{"text":"Everyone who comes here gets crabs!

Shuck's Tavern II on Flamingo is the perfect place to go for delicious crab legs and seafood.  The portions are generous, the service is quick, and the prices are very reasonable.  

I would give this place 5 stars if it were only a seafood restaurant, but it is not.  There are many other options on the menu, and most are forgettable.  The Chicken Caesar wrap was awful, and should not be ordered.  The wrap was soggy with a bland dressing, and chewy chicken. 

You wouldn't go to a pizza place and order a filet would you?  Stick to the delicious ocean fare at this tavern, and a few cold beers, and you can't go wrong.

This is a Dallas Cowboys bar, you have been warned."}
{"text":"I love this place and I come here all the time; excellent seafood!  It's open 24hrs, so its convenient when you want seafood at 3am!  They have a large selection of seafood here, everything from shrimp platters to crab legs, oysters, mussels, wraps tacos, clam bakes, gumbo and pastas.  The prices are very reasonable too.  The bartenders are awesome.  The atmosphere here is very chill/low key.  Great place to grab some beer and seafood with friends.  They also have great deals on breakfast; I think the breakfast is priced around $4.  Its definitely worth checking out!  Its kind of hidden though; its near the corner of elkhorn/durango; across from Smiths.  You'll have to drive around to the back to park."}
{"text":"I would not come back here. The service was friendly and timely, but other than that, this place is not notable.

-drinks were average and rather expensive for what was served ($6 for a well drink at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon?)
-oysters (we ordered a half dozen) smelled fishy and didn't taste fresh
-crab cakes were average and $10 for only 2 small ones"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to try Shucks the other night.  We pass by it all the time but had never been there before. Overall, it wasn't bad. The service was good, the beer was good, and the atmosphere was good. My fiancé had clams and New England clam chowder and she loved them both. As for me, I had the Texas oysters. There are supposed to be prepared with tequila, lime, and Tabasco. Sounds pretty awesome, right? Well they had no flavor. I also had the crawfish appetizer. They were pretty good and came in quite a big portion for an appetizer. Since we both like seafood, we'll probably be back. I'll stick to crab legs for next time"}
{"text":"Great place, good Oysters, and calamari, the lobster roll is decent, but the seafood louie salad dressing is awesome."}
{"text":"My family and I went here earlier today. My mom is allergic to my cat (oops) and can't stay in the apartment for over 30 mins, so I couldn't cook her the elaborate Thanksgiving meal we had hoped for. Thankfully, Shuck's was open and they even had a special menu for the day and $1 oyster specials. The waitresses were SO sweet and kind. I kind of felt like the devil for going to a restaurant on Thanksgiving day but if I had to, I think Shuck's was the best choice.

The Thanksgiving menu was pretty generous, for $11 you got a ton of food and a piece of pie (pecan or pumpkin). The food was solid/good, I'd say their seafood is better than their Thanksgiving fare. Regardless, the fact that they were even open made me super, super grateful, because I don't know what else we would have done!"}
{"text":"only gets one star because service was horrible. Food is fairly good. I walked in with my husband and sat at the bar. We were there for late night and we were asked by the guy bartender to move to the corner if we weren't drinking. I wanted to leave right away like who does that? Then he sat 2 girls in our spot and they didnt even have a drink!! none the less he completely ignored us and I swore I would not return to this place"}
{"text":"What a Big Disappointment today My husband and went to Shucks for lunch and we haven't been there for awhile I ordered a spicy Maria and for 9.00 give me a break. it wasn't anything special No celery like it was advertised three olives though and it wasn't spicy. My husband had gumbo it looked like gravy other than gumbo He did get two small crab legs and only two shrimp it was so soupy and it was bland and for him to put Tabasco I knew it wasn't good What a Bad lunch."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING with late night orders to go!! My hubby works late and I had him go by TWICE this past week on his way home. (I'm sending him again tonight!! ) A lot of times when you order to go (especially late at night)...you know your food isn't very fresh but this place cares about their food and you can tell!! 
Their Seafood Louis is so yummy! The lobster, crab meat and shrimp are fresh and the Louis Dressing is fantastic. The Coconut Shrimp was served with a coconut dipping sauce...it's delicious!
If you want yummy seafood late at night...you should check this place out!!"}
{"text":"This is just up the street where I live!  Went  to Thursday $1.00 Oysters and had 2 dozens!!!  What a great price, 2 dz for $24.00!  It was good oysters (not great but for the price you are paying for, it's a great deal!) and decided to order appetizer (the mussels) which was good and a great amount!  I ordered the 1/2lb Dungess crab and it was not lacking any meat and for the price of $8.95 for half pound, I think it's a great deal!  It's a lot less expensive then Joe's Crab Shack and it was gooooddddd!

Overall I will definitely go back as a regular.  It was very slow on a Thursday, given it was $1.00 Oyster night but I don't mind it not being bust because our food came out in a timely manner!  This will replace Joe's Crab Shack!  Price was great and food was good!"}
{"text":"My family and I always eat at the other shucks location and the food and service is great. We came here because we were on this side of town and I don't know if it has a different owner or what but the service was horrible and the food was worse then bad. I hate to leave such a negative review but I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}

{"text":"The wife and I have lived in this area for 2 years and never gave this place a chance.  Now we really wish we have come here before now.  There is a nice bar and the dining area is separate enough to really enjoy either side of the house.  I would not hesitate to bring my kid here.  I had the shrimp po boy and the wife had steamed crab and fried shrimp.  All of our food was very good and the service was great.  Good key lime pie too."}

We have had 3 times now the Spanish waiter with the glasses. He is fantastic and he's off sun Monday so we come in when he's there. I know I gave u a bad review before and that stuff really did happen maybe 4 years ago now but we came back and I swear, you have the best Dungeness I have ever had anywhere. We will keep coming back and I recommend u to anyone who will listen."}

{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars except for the graveyard bartender on SUNDAYs is by far the worst bartender I have ever encountered and I work in the industry.  Don't got there after midnight on Sundays unless you want to spend the rest of your night wondering if your food or drinks will ever come.. He does seem to be really good at avoiding you when you need him though.. It's too bad because we're regulars there and he's served us several times and we still haven't had a good experience with him..

Any other day this place is AWESOME the other bartenders are great! Food is great! Atmosphere is great as so are the prices!"}
{"text":"My 2nd favorite Shuck's.  Although, I like the feel of the Centennial location better, the crowd on Flamingo is a little more diverse.  You never know if there's a party, sports league, rowdy bunch, or whatever else makes for good people watching.

Still great fresh seafood and cold beers.  Gotta love locals joints!"}
{"text":"My favorite Shuck's location!
Sometimes you just need some raw oysters and a cold pale ale!  
I've eaten at all Shuck's and never had questionable freshness on the seafood.

Great little menu in a local bar."}
{"text":"First time here...having just moved to Nevada(vegas) it's still odd to see gaming in so many locations! What got me the most was the smoking in the bar...haven't seen that in a restaurant area in years. It wasn't too bad but noticeable.

The beer and mixed drinks were tasty. The beer was cheap at 2$ for a 16 oz special. We ordered tuna tartare to start and wanted 10 more...it was that good. Very fresh and big chunks of raw tuna with avocado and balsamic was amazing. 

We had 1 1/2 lbs of mixed crab legs which were flavorful and meaty. We had a side of onion rings and they were just ok. 

Overall I can see us heading back for more. On a side note it was very chilly inside. Take a jacket!"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd Shucks I've been to. The first one is the one located in Centennial area & I've had their breakfast croissant sandwich before which is my favorite!!! YUMMY! This location I went to, to meet a friend. I found that there are a lot of senior citizens that hang out @ this place. They chose to sit @ the bar drinking, gambling & eating dinner. Probably not a place for young people to hang out at. Bartenders were nice. Could have been a little more efficient of keeping the drinks filled & plates cleared away. It wasn't really that busy when I was there. Dinning area was dead, seems the bar area is the place to hang out. Ran into two weirdos while there. One guy who seemed to be a frequent flyer who appeared hyper on meth. & another odd old man asking for my permission & another lady's permission to sit at the bar...really? Odd.... I won a little money on the video poker machine but gave back my winnings....lol My sandwich was tasty."}
{"text":"Good Food, Good Drinks, Great Service!  It's not always easy to find a gaming bar that is smoke free - this is a great neighborhood spot where you won't leave smelling like smoke."}

{"text":"Went there last night to bring home a seafood bucket.... Had crab legs, Mussels and Shrimp.... Crab legs were of the smaller variety but really very tasty as were the Mussels and Shrimp... Good neighborhood place to go!"}
{"text":"Love this place!

It's a little over a mile from our house so when I feel like hanging out, getting some late night snackin and some beer, this is always my first choice. 

Their prices are cheap.
The oysters are fresh.

I have even gone to Big Al's at the Orleans and I was served with foamy oysters. Eww!"}

{"text":"I came in at 1am with my husband and there was no wait. We ordered 1 dozen oysters, a half pound of crab legs, an oyster shooter, and stuffed shrimp. Everything was delicious! I was really surprised lol I read some bad reviews and was soooo worried but we had a great experience. Our server and bartender had a great attitude and was super nice. I will definitely be back  we paid $44 for everything not including tip. What a great price!"}
{"text":"Got what we ordered, food was prepared correctly and delivered promptly. Nice to go somewhere with good food and good service. Oysters shooters are pretty good, really good. I ordered the Shucks Shooter, comes with a shot oh vodka."}
{"text":"Ever since we moved to Las Vegas, I have been meaning to try this place. We finally took the plunge and went in on a weeknight for some oysters and seafood. The place was packed which is always a good sign. 

They have a great menu selection and it was difficult to decide what to order. There were a number of options that I wanted to try. I settled on 6 oysters to start and was told that they were from Louisiana. I love oysters, but had never had any from Louisiana so my interests were peaked. They arrived and they were meaty and large. However, the taste was underwhelming. The last few almost tasted badly. Not sure if my taste-buds are just adverse for Lousiana oysters or if the quality was not there (the oysters were on special that night), either way, I will not be ordering next time I go back which is disapointing for an oyster bar. I wish they had a better selection for oysters.

I got a salad with crab meat, shrimp, and ahi tuna. The salad was great! The dressing was tasty and the quality of seafood was delicious. My husband ordered the salmon and he was pleased with his meal, as well.

Customer service could use some improvement. Everyone was friendly, but they were slow with greating us and getting us the check. I noticed other customers were frustrated with the slow service, as well. We will definitely be back and my review may go up depending on how the customer service is the next time we go to this spot."}
{"text":"Awesome Food and Great service always! The Buffalo Shrimp Wrap is super delicious! Try it or you're missing out!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. With friends or solo mission it's the place to be. Nice, clean and friendly environment. The food makes this cheat day worth every last calorie. Check them out ."}
{"text":"Came to happy hour with all of our family and I wasnt very impressed , the 3.00 margaritas were disgusting. The service was super slow. Im pretty sure my sister in laws mom got sick from eating the oysters there. She tried one and sent it back but was sick the rest of the evening. She told the waiter she could tell they werent fresh. I had the ceviche it was ok but nothing special. I definitely will not be recommending this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"It took them 1hr to cook our food. Mind you there were less than 10people in the place. They suck!"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times and really like the food. We took my husband's parents here Thursday night Jan. 23 2014 and the service was just AWFUL.! Despite there being several bartenders (we sat at the bar) we had to ask each time we wanted another drink as our glasses sat there empty. We ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell to split and when the guy brought them out and asked who wanted them we told them we were splitting them. His response was \"how are we going to do this?\" Seriously?!? Give us another plate dude! I hate telling people how to do their own job. We were left without napkins and had to get up to get our own from other tables more than once. Then we were charged for our Father's drink because he only bet $20 in the machine. 

The food was good (even though I ate a couple oysters without crackers because it took a long time to get the bartender's attention to ask for them.) The crab cakes were previously frozen so not so good. I'm giving more than one star because the food was pretty good but overall we were pretty shocks at how incompetent and bad the service was."}
{"text":"I've been to the Shucks on Flamingo on several occasions for breakfast.  On a recent visit visit I tried the baby Mother-Shucker burger.  It was delicious.  But enough about the other location

Stopped in at this location with the GF to grab a bite.  I found it to be pretty mellow given it was a football Sunday.  Some of the propaganda on the wall indicated this is a Bears bar.  I figure since the Bears played later in the day, this place was probably rocking.

This location is clean, spacious and everyone working was friendly enough.

Looking at the menu, I was reminded of the MOTHER-SHUCKER.  It was so delicious the last time I had it.  I asked myself several times, do I go big or do I go small?  I figured I was hungry enough to give the big one a shot.

According to the Sucks menu the Mother-Shucker is described as, \"a full one-pound patty stuffed with bacon bits and american cheese. topped with lettuce,tomato, pickle planks, grilled mushrooms, melted swiss cheese, fried onion straws and our secret \"mother shucken\" sauce. served on a giant toasted bun. cooked to order.\"

I was given a choice of fries, waffle fries, onion rings or garlic fries.  I picked the garlic fries.

When the meal arrived.  The burger looked outstanding.  I had ordered medium well, but it looked like it was cooked just plain old medium. I am not hating, I can do either.

So satisfying was the burger, I did not have to at all the rest of the day.  I may or may not have been on the verge of meat sweats.

The garlic fries were all garlic and a nice compliment to meal. As was the Honey Brown beer.  The beer came out super cold and remained cool as I devoured the burger.

Not sure if I will ever put my body through Mother-Shucker experience again, but I will absolutely pay Shucks another visit."}
{"text":"Shucks was the pick of a particular day about a week ago, with promises of a $3.95 breakfast after a good morning of training.  While en route, my buddy placed a call while on the move  to confirm the ever so tempting price of a less then $5.00 dollar breakfast.  The phone call confirmed that it was a dollar more BUT still under a finski.  Upon arrival, ST&OB was found to be very mellow at eleven something in the morning.  FYI...The breakfast special runs until 1:00PM.  I ordered up a chicken fried steak, with two eggs (over medium) served with home fries (wanted/ordered cheese, didn't get) with sourdough toast.  The food came out pipping hot  and tasted like a $8.00 breakfast.....Hell, it tasted like a $12.00 breakfast.  The service was friendly and the establishment was clean.  Absolutely an opton to vist again if in the area."}
{"text":"Very good food and great service, definitely my favorite little getaway :) didn't get the name of the waitress but she had a red bow ;)"}
{"text":"Coming from the Northeast, you learn what is and isn't a good a New England Clam Chowder. Shucks is near the top of my favorite list in clam chowder. It's thick, creamy, and most importantly, it's meaty and there's a good amount of potatoes. I can say that their $5.95 bowl of chowder beats all of the $8 to $12 bowls that some fancy seafood places might charge. 
I also had the Crab Alfredo. Creamy and a lot of crab meat. It was really filling. Looking at the menu, there are a lot of combos and other dishes too. I can not wait to come back and try more. 
Just a note before you pack the family in the car to come here: you must be 21 to enter and the bar allows smoking, the dining area is completely non-smoking."}
{"text":"Fridays is the best day to come here- they offer daily specials, but Friday's choices are by far the best value. You can pick orders of crawfish, mussels, crab cocktail, or crab & spinach dip for a flat $5 each. And did I mention martinis are half off ($10 each down to $5)? And they don't halve the portions for the specials, we're talking gigantic, full orders, for minimal money.

CRAB COCKTAIL: It's crab, the portion isn't huge but it's fresh and tasty, and you can't beat $5 (regularly ~$10?). Order one per person, or whoever gets their hands on it first is going to eat the whole thing.
MUSSELS: Large portion, white wine sauce. Not the best sauce, but again, you can't beat the value for the price/portion. Easily a meal for one, and sided with a piece of their addictively-good garlic cheese bread.
CRAWFISH: Available depending on the season, also sided with the bread. Not nearly as good as other places in town, though it isn't the easiest dish to find in the first place. Wouldn't get again, but it's not necessarily bad.
MARTINITS: The \"dirty shucker\" is a classic dirty martini, done well but the Chocolate Salted Pretzel is the stuff of legends. See Lisa H's review for more coverage, but it's something you have to try at least once. Fridays, for $5, is the best night to do so.

Service was friendly, and the bar is lined with TVs, making it a good spot to watch the game. Draft domestics were ~$4 while bottled specialty beers were about $5. In addition to all this money-saving awesomeness, Shucks is open 24/7!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! As a Bears fan I love havering a place to go and watch he game with other local bears fans!! The food is always awesome and they have the freshest oysters!!!"}
{"text":"We decided for shucks after searching happy hour places in our neighborhood and their happy hour menu sounded great.

So glad we have a 24 hour eatery just around the corner.  Don't know why we haven't become regulars.  

Little did we know that the happy hour only got better after midnight! Darn it!  So definitely ask for their midnight menu. You can order a burger and fries for under $4 and oysters are $1, as well as under $4 breakfast.

On this trip we ordered the clam strips ($5) the waffle fries ($1.95), peel and each shrimp($5) and the portions were good sized and very tasty. 

I will say the missing star is for the initial lack of service we received upon entering.  There is no signage of \"wait to be seated\" or \"seat yourself\" so we waited a bit and the bartenders just glanced at us a couple of times but still no direction. 

Our server was not the greatest but I guess its past everyone's bed time. He never offered to refill our drinks but the gentleman who took over was very pleasant so we had a great ending to our late night snack!"}
{"text":"Best champagne oyster shooters I've had. Karina at the bar was awesome! Service, drinks, and food were all great plus hey had our soccers games on! In a great location and easy access from the freeway."}
{"text":"I give them 2 stars for the great service and hospitality of the bartenders and servers, ON THE OTHER HAND THE FOOD it's mediocre whith no flavor what so ever . Ceviche was decent everything else insipid."}
{"text":"Delicious seafood. They offer a variety of things from seafood to burgers. Great place for a family dinner and reasonably priced. Service was great. I will be returning when visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The service as well as the food is very good. A little overpriced. However, they have daily specials that are a pretty good deal. I'm not sure where they get there oysters from but they are very tiny. I just spent 2 weeks in New Orleans and ate at Acme's Oyster house four times. The oysters were 3 to 4 times larger at Acme. I think that if Shucks is going to serve such small oysters they should either give you extra (like Acme does when there's are small) or discount them. Just my humble opinion."}
{"text":"Just gross. Went there for breakfast because it was near me. The food was very poor quality and the restaurant area smelled like cigarettes smoke. My boyfriend didn't like it either. Go to The Cracked Egg, The Egg & I or Jamm's instead. TRUST me!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here around 1 a.m. on a Thursday (Vegas hours, totally normal) to quench his newfound appetite for oysters. A quick search on Yelp brought us to Shucks just in time for the Thursday special - $1 oysters. They also had a late night menu available, with typical bar fare (burgers, wings, calamari, chicken strips) for about $5. We ordered a dozen oysters to share, and he had a half pound of peel and eat shrimp. As far as the oysters, I suppose you get what you pay for. Granted... it's July, we're smack dab in the middle of a desert, and they were a dollar; but these definitely weren't the freshest oysters I've ever had. Boyf mowed through his shrimp pretty quickly and seemed satisfied. 

This place is kind of a cross between a dive bar and a generic Applebee's-esque chain. It was open, clean, and not at all smoky; a big plus in my book. The bartender was prompt and to the point, but didn't go out of his way to make small talk. They had a great double IPA from Utah on tap, and he was nice enough to comp our drinks even though I was only sporadically playing 25 cent hands of video blackjack. 

Bottom line: for the price, it was decent, but I'll take Boiling Crab or Hot N Juicy any day."}
{"text":"Nothing screams great place to hang out more than good food, good beer and good friends. 

Since I'm somewhat new to town, I joined a Kickball league. Yeah, laugh all you want, but every week I get to hang out with cool people and play a \"sport\"....but afterwards, we all come to Shucks. 

The drink prices are very reasonable, the food is solid. Try the Cuban wrap. Fricking amazing. 

The servers are really great. I recommend Ashley. She is the coolest. 

Also , this is a BIG Cowboys bar, so if you actually like that team, come here and hang out. I'm a Jets fan, but who cares. I like a good time, and I know I can find it here. 

P.S. The booths are very comfortable. The bathrooms are clean. And again, try the Cuban Wrap."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!!! This place is a definite No Go!! I have been 3 times. I give them at least that, and every time it was something different. The first time the food was cold. Not only mine, but the guy next to me had a case of for sure food poisoning if he would eaten his. The second time, I was treated like crap,(ignored, talked down too) I guess-it was because I wasn't a (Regular). And tonight, I was humiliated by the bartender. I was looking for a machine, after eating in the restaurant, I circled the bar 3-4 times. I passed a lady that was not gambling but sitting in front of 3 machines with her friends, she said \"I'm leaving\" I said, I don't want to run you off\". She said I been here long enough, I lost a lot. So I sat down just putting my money in, and from across the bar the female bartender yelled \"We have a waiting list for these machines. I had no idea! I could not believe how rude she was!! I get it, people were waiting. But I didn't know. If I was her boss, I would have fired her on the spot. You don't treat people like that. Three strikes! Their out. Awful place!"}
{"text":"Generous portion...Seared ahi- tdf!!  Seafood bisque awesome too. Love this place.last time I had crab Louie salad, also awesome. Went here for st. Patricks and it was hoppin!!! Today, around 2pm not busy, a good time to drop in and check it out"}
{"text":"UPDATE:
Met some friends here for drinks and the drinks/food were great and the server was super nice! We gambled and guess what.. he comped a few of our drinks! Isn't that how it should be?! Thanks Brooks! 


LAST REVIEW:
Came here last night w a friend.  Ordered the \"create your own\" with 4!items.. got the calamari which was not good. No flavor and some pieces had undercooked breading on them. The oysters (he said were great! I don't eat them), coconut shrimp and ceviche that we both loved! Also got a bowl of poke to share (which was sooooo good! He got a French connection (courvoisier and grand marnier) and an energy drink. I got a michelada (good flavor) and a ginger ale. 
We Both lost $20 in the machine.. and didn't even get my soda comped.. hmmm. That's unheard of.
5 stars for the food. 
2 stars for the service. Although he was pleasant to us (minus not comping anything) the way he talked to some of the customers wasn't nice. \"You need menus?\" \"Then come get em\""}
{"text":"Went here for Thanksgiving dinner. It was empty of course but who eats seafood on Thanksgiving anyway, besides for my family? They had a special turkey dish to accomodate those who wanted a traditional meal.

I ordered & shared the clam bake which consisted of dungenous & snow crab, manila clams, sausage, potatoes, & corn for about $25. It was definitely worth it but I've tasted better clam bakes before.

Our waiter was pretty slow. He forgot to put in our order for oysters. Apparently this restaurant is known for their oysters so I wanted to try some atleast but that didn't happen. He also didn't give us utensils. We pretty much had to wave him down if we wanted something. Pretty bad considering we were basically the only table there."}
{"text":"Great place. Love the flat iron steak. For price for the quality, plus it's always tasty and cooked to the right temp. The scallop appetizer is a steal, especially the Asian one with rice and vegetables. It's really entrée sized.  The lamb chop t-bones are always my favorite. You get 3 per order."}
{"text":"We really liked coming here! My husband is a huge fan of seafood. He got the swordfish special and I got fish and chips. We also got mussels as an appetizer. The swordfish was amazing! I am jealous I didn't get it. The fish and chips were good. The mussels were very good and there were a ton of them! We will be returning. The service was a little slow when we were there, that's the reason for the four-star review."}
{"text":"Always great tunes playing...the 5 for $5 Friday is awesome! The bar always spins up a quality beve!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to come late at night, after work, for great food. Their oysters are amazing and I usually get those,  but this time I had their crab legs and you can't go wrong either way! My friend had one of the best burgers I've ever had, it had blue cheese on it, I forgot the name of it. Affordable drinks and great food at all hours, what more can you ask for!?"}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here after having not been here in years. Still how I remember it, and always wonderful. Has a strong cigarette smell though so if that bothers you maybe go elsewhere... but what do you expect. I recommend breakfast especially!"}
{"text":"Food was decent. Ordered shrimp combo platter which was great. What turned me off was the smoke from the bar. The bar wasn't separated from the eating area and we could smell all the smoke. Sorry, but that doesn't make any meal worth coming back."}
{"text":"We ordered a side of crab legs and I ordered a steak.  The waiter brought me steak and crab legs.  When I told him I only ordered the steak because we had gotten the crab legs on the side he said okay and grabbed the crab legs off my plate.  Is it just me or was that a little weird.  I have been plenty of other places that have said oh okay well just go ahead and have them but I will take them off your ticket.  I have never had anyone just reach over and take food off my plate that was not related to me or dating me.  And on top of it all not very good food.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I met with my trainer at Fitlabs down the street on Friday.  He told me I should eat oysters once a week.  I drove directly from the gym to Shucks Tavern and Oyster Bar to remedy the situation immediately.

I had the barbecued oysters.  They were good and served so hot the shells were kind of burning my fingers.  I loved the oysters but I thought I'd like to see a little less sauce so you can taste the oyster.  Next time I will try the regular oysters and compare.  Very good.  I am going to target Thursdays for the Oysters.

Fridays they have a happy hour and so I ordered fried calamari and some fries and some iced tea.  My bill with tip was right at $20.  

It was good food but it would be a lot more fun with the friends in tow!"}
{"text":"So I come into this place all the time. The bartenders are usually amazing but IVE had two bad experiences in a row now. Last night we stopped in late to grab a few drinks and some food. Sat around for 10 minutes before the rude bartender came over with her mouth full of food to ask what we wanted. 
The food was decent as usual but the bartender never refilled our cocktails and never even came back to see how the food was.
Then this morning, I was craving some breakfast and a Bloody Mary so I sat at the bar per usual and waited 15 minutes then left. The bartender never even came out... 
Really turned me off to this place!"}
{"text":"Tonight was not a great night at this Shucks as the Cigar smoke got to us as soon as we walked in the door. We went to a booth but still had to move farther back. The fish fry was not as good as a normal Friday as the fish was very Greasy and the cole slaw so dry that even the waiter agreed but did nothing to correct it. Going to stay away as this was our Friday nite fish spot but we are going to try some other places."}
{"text":"I am giving this place one star due to fact that on arriving there was a sign stating no one under 21 was allowed in the building despite the profile on Yelp stating the opposite."}
{"text":"Love everything about  the place!  Alway have the best service,food, and drinks. Special  thank u to brooke and all the staff members."}
{"text":"Great seafood. Love their fried oysters. Great food choices, casual, eat at the bar if you want. Classic rock plays, come as you are. Food served in paper lined baskets. Everything I've ever ordered was delicious. Sports on all the tv's, video poker machines at the bar. Casual ambiance, friendly staff."}
{"text":"I like this spot. It's real chill and reasonably priced. I've been on 2 occasions and I'm sure I'll be back. If I had to say something I don't like about this place is it would be so much better if they offered a happy hour on drinks instead of just on the gaming then it would certainly be one of my go to hang-outs. Still good spot however."}
{"text":"I love this place. This place is one of the rear why I moved back to Vegas from Philadelphia. You can get any kind of food at any time of the day. I live their fried shrimp and fried scallops."}
{"text":"So, this is a bar. For anyone that might be confused (we were). We thought we'd found a cool local seafood joint, but no. They even have a kids menu. But it's one small room, half is a bar and half is booths. The \"bar\" is smoking, dining area is non, but there's absolutely nothing dividing the two. So you'll be breathing in smoke while you eat. Not good for kids at all. This is not a family place."}
{"text":"Hmmm..I don't know why this place is so underrated.Went around 1am last night for the 1.00 oysters (Which are no longer $1.00 they are now $1.50)Anyways I was a little skeptical about the place due to the reviews but I'm so glad I went anyways.Oysters were on point super fresh didn't experience any sand or what not.They had half off draft beer which was even more awesome!!Didn't get the bartender name but he was awesome as well.Beer was super cold, oysters were fresh bartender never left us thirsty (And he's a raider fan)The bar/restaurant was very clean.Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I am really a fan of Shucks!
Came here on random occasions for some time and always enjoyed the food. 
Recently, I had some friends in town and after one breakfast at Shucks, they made it their home base. This years, I have been there 5 times for a meal and some drinks. Now, on a first name basis with several servers, my gf and I are trying every sandwich and breakfast item. If you a fan of Fries, you are in luck, they are among the best!! Waffle and regular!!

Check it out, it's a good join, neat specials and very, very awesome staff!!
(I don't work there, but I would)"}
{"text":"I was craving oysters on a Thursday night. Went to Shuck's because it was nearby my house and had dollar oysters special on Thursdays which is all they had going. Came in, sat down and I asked if they still had dollar oysters. Sadly, waitress informed us that it's $1.50 now. I looked at the menu and it's actually cheaper by 5 cents if you order a dozen from the menu. Had the oysters here before and it was hit or miss, some were way too small. Food price is overinflated. Food is just meh, for the price not worth it. Much rather go to seafood buffet or oyster bar at palace station at least you're getting your money's worth for way much more delicious seafood. Never again will I come here."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE by Trainai. I've been going there for years. Unfortunately, the service continues to get worse. It's as if no one is watching employees in the restaurant section! Dinner and bar service are good. I'm specifically referring to breakfast. Trainai doesn't seem to care about her tables/patrons at all! The only time you get a smile or a thank you as when she's dropping off the check because it's close to tip time. Last time we went we could see in to the kitchen and saw that our food sat there for over five minutes before she picked it up. The restaurant was not busy. She was near the beverage station joking with other employees and texting. They have a small table at the back of the restaurant where they wrap utensils in napkins. She spent a great deal of the time we were there sitting at that table, while ignoring us for the most part. She was talking to other employees, texting and even leaning ON the napkins. Gross! At one point she coughed on them and continued as if it was nothing. So disgusting!!!!! Another time she was leaning over it while she was texting and literally had her armpits on the napkins. Gross!! If it weren't for her lack of caring about her patrons, this place would be a four star or even a five star because of the value. 

The food is good and even the prices have gone up quite a bit in the last couple years, it is still a great value! Cool place to hang out and have drinks and watch games, especially if you're a Bears fan! Check out the specials posted on the wall as you walk in! Just do yourself a favor and don't sit in her section."}
{"text":"Went to try this place with my husband. First off the air conditioner was out on a 110 degree day. Not really their fault. But their bartender was serving drinks to everyone and never even offered water. I had to ask. We were gambling and ordered drinks. Had to pay for them. Unusual in Vegas but ok. What wasn't ok was the shots we ordered and waited 10 minutes for only to get water with a drop of liquor. This place cost way too much for the horrible service we received. Not going back."}
{"text":"Fresh seafood,,Tasty food,,Great Bloody Marys...Good prices...Clean place"}
{"text":"Although I've only checked in twice,  the boyfriend and I have dined here a few more times than that,  and we've never been disappointed.  We're always aware that during certain time of the year, certain seafood will not be in season. 

Friday's special: 1/2 price Martinis and $5 appetizers (crab cocktail,  crab spinach dip,  mussels,  calamari, & crawfish)

Tonight, the linings of my stomach was calling for seafood and beer, and Shucks had both! Once we arrived, there was a bit of a crowd, but it seemed everyone was enjoying their food that the noise level was amazingly low. 

We sat ourselves,  and our server,  Ash, immediately greeted us and started with our drinks.  She was super sweet and attentive!  I was craving everything on the menu that Ash let me order one thing at a time and was quick with the service!  Loved her for it! 

So we ended the night with two beers, two $5 specials (mussels and crab spinach dip),  Texas oysters (not spicy at all), and 1/2 lb snow crabs legs (not fully in season).  The mussels was Ahh-mazing! I wish the crab spinach dip came with more crab :/ and the Texas oysters was suppose to be topped with lemon,  tequila, and tabasco ... I didn't taste any of it :/ Shouldve just gone with the 1/2 dozen of oysters and asked for extra lemon and Tabasco. At least the will be a next time! :D"}
{"text":"I really don't get some of the low ratings that other users have posted. If you're looking for good quality Pub Food (Burgers, Sandwiches, Breakfasts, etc) served 24 hours a day, Shucks is Awesome. I haven't tried out their crab and oyster special nights but I've heard from friends they are pretty decent value.  I mostly go on the graveyard shift and they have some ridiculously low priced specials on Graveyard. Big Burger and Fries for $4, Omelets $4, and quite a few other options. The food is consistently good and high quality. The graveyard bartender ( I think his name is Larry) is super friendly, always has a menu ready for me, knows what I like to drink, and remembers my name and what I had eaten the time before even though it's sometimes a month or so between visits.

In Summary, Shucks is on my short list of places to stop for food late at night when I want something decent, I don't want to pay an arm and a leg, and just want to get in and out in a reasonable amount of time.

{"text":"This place is great BUT if the bartender Doug shows up, LEAVE! He is the rudest a$$hole I've ever seen and doesn't care about you or anything else!"}
{"text":"their breakfast rocks , cant beat the price , dont let the secret out !"}
{"text":"Newcastle on tap, of course I'm there!  My father loves this place so it is always in the plan to have dinner there when he is here.  We always start with oysters on the half shell which are always good and hot wings which are pretty good too.  For dinner I always get the crab cakes and side salad.   The crabcakes are yummy!  The side salad is top notch as well.  My hubby loves there alfredo and the kids like the food a lot too.  We have tried just about everything and it's all good.  Love the Clam Bake and Ahi tacos.  If you are a seafood lover, try this and you will not be disappointed!

Good sandwiches and steak and ribs....I just can't stop..they have it all and it's ALL GOOD!"}
{"text":"This is strictly a BREAKFAST review.  For the price, you can't beat it in the area (Centennial Hills).  The service is a little shoddy, but overall a great deal to recharge on a Sunday morning"}
{"text":"By the owner of Beanos comes... Shucks.  After being a regular at Beanos, I thought that I knew what to expect: Hole in the wall, decent food.

Wasn't expecting a large, regular late-night crowd, friendly crowd, and a varied, delicious sea-food menu available at all hours along with some very affordable breakfast deals!  

It's now high on my list of late-night dining simply for the quality of food: for example - excellent garden omelet for four bucks that comes with the usual toast and poattoes.  But the tomatoes are simmered, the spinach is plentiful, the mushrooms are roasted before being tossed into the eggs.  It's worth the ten minute drive up the 95 for me.  

The seafood is fresh and plentiful - they don't skimp on the portions!"}
{"text":"A new review- would love to give Shucks on Durango a 5 Star rating because the bartenders are awesome.  Unfortunately the clientele are cigarette smoking, foul mouth POS's. It's a shame when you can't sit at the bar with your wife and talk to your favorite bar tender without hearing blatant sex talk. Not appropriate ! I know it's a bar but use some common sense. And yes, Josh, you know who they are."}
{"text":"I would consider this place a dive. Bar is not stocked at all. No top shelf. Old timers and locals. Bad food. Place was dead. Would not return."}
{"text":"I really like this place. so calm with delicious dishes!"}
{"text":"Was here last night with my sister. We wanted a quick bite. I liked the decor of this place and definitely feeling the food here! We ordered the calamari which was cooked to perfection! And we ordered the Rockefeller oysters which were delicioso! And the mussels, reminded me of hot and juicy. We also ordered a couple drinks. And all of this was $50. I was very pleased with the pricing here. Well done. Definitely coming back here or bringing a friend !"}
{"text":"The New England Chowder was not too thick but deliciously flavored, so was the crab spinach dip w super thin tortillas, and the oyster PO boys were good too...albeit, more oysters wouldn't have hurt:)  my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Incredible seafood, FRESH!  Great Prices.  Crab Lovers this is the spot."}
{"text":"I was served a cold $8.95 seafood Benedict and it was served 10 minutes after my family's meals. When I spoke to the server and then manager, they were extremely disrespectful and defensive. I've been coming here for years and have never had such a terrible experience. How sad."}
{"text":"I live in the area and wanted somewhere different to get some food, drinks, and play a little keno. 
Reviews were not very good but, I was pleasantly surprised. Service was perfect. We were greeted as soon as we sat down, asked by numerous bartenders if we needed anything, and very friendly. We happen to go on $1 oyster night which was a plus. The oysters were very nice sized but, a bit gritty. I had the gumbo which was no compare to Oyster Bar quality but, still good. I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night. A bowl pf peel n eat shrimp was $5. Not bad. Good service, but the food was ok. Oysters were fresh but really small. The appetizer we ordered, spinach artichoke dip, was weirdly colored blue almost. The chips it came with tasted a bit burnt. The drinks we ordered weren't bad, but they weren't good either. Overall, we will come here for the small but fresh oysters. But most likely that would be it."}
{"text":"Shucks to me, as a Stand alone restaurant is one of the very few left in this great city of Las Vegas with quality and standards above the rest. 
Always amazing service and food.
The quality of food to price ratio is crazy. Really inexpensive for what you get.
I rather eat here than most places on the strip.
I'm very lucky too,that I live close to this spot..
Don't think of it as just gaming bar food . (Won't mention any names)If you just come for the food you won't be Disappointed.  
Specially the great sandwiches and burgers. 
Ohh...and keep your eye on the great specials on the door as you enter."}
{"text":"Great service awesome food shows the games on Sundays prices are average would recommend here forsure !"}
{"text":"Generous big plate with huge coconut shrimp is so worth it! I love Fresh crab meat Louie salad with toast. SoooOoo good. All the food is so good. Oysters so fresh too!"}
{"text":"I have been pissed at this place for a while but decided to give it a chance tonight.  Kind of let bygones be bygones.  The reason I was pissed is that during the football season I called them to see if they were showing the Chargers game.  They said yes.  So we drove there and before we parked I went in and asked them again and they said yes.  So we went in (in our Chargers shirts) and sat at the end of the sports bar next to someone else in a Chargers jersey and told the female bartender what we wanted to watch and she said no problem.  We ordered beers and after a while noticed that the Chargers game should have already started.  So we mentioned it to the bartender and she went to check and came back and told us the owner would only let her put the Bears game on (there are a milllion tv screens in there and it shouldn't have been a problem to have our little end of the bar watching the Chargers).  So by the time we fpund another sports bar we missed more than the first quarter of the game.  Seems to me I did enough checking and they should have stood by their promises.

Anyway.... we tried the place again for the food.  It was only OK.  We had calamari appitizer which was OK but I would have liked cocktail sauce instead of marinara for dipping.  Ordered the Shucks salad which had crab, a few shrimp and a decent size peice of seared tuna on it.  The tuna was only so-so but the crab and shrimp was good.  My guy had a bowl of the seafood bisque.  He asked if they had any sourdough bread to go with it and they brought him two pieces of sourdough toast like you would have with breakfast.  Seems to me a seafood place should have some good crusty bread, don't you think?  Do not order the ice tea.  It is not brewed, we had to send it back."}
{"text":"The food is great but I agree with the rest of these reviews, the service is awful. I got scallops which were great, but the service was not there, at all. If I go back I'll be sure to avoid the older filipino woman!"}
{"text":"Food was great,service was horrible! My fiancé and I went during a very slow. It was only us and one other table in there so there's no excuse for the way the service was I had to get up three times to ask for our check! The food was delicious just wish they would hire better servers!"}
{"text":"One star because they won't let you say no stars.  I'm usually a good fan of shucks but tonight when I had company in town we sent back three orders :fried oysters were burnt, fish n chips were not cooked completely and then the mussels were overcooked. We never saw a manager  and never received a proper apology waiter seemed to think it was funny with each plate that was sent back.  I was throughly disappointed and will not return"}
{"text":"I was kind of nervous about going to this place, but I love seafood. I had read a lot of bad reviews about the service. I was pleasantly surprised. It was seat yourself, but there was someone there right away to ask for a drink order. We were only there for a quick lunch, so it was just sodas. Good to know that they have $3 margaritas.  We just ordered the crab cake stuffed shrimp and the clam strips, a cup of clam chowder and a cup of seafood bisque.

The clam chowder was really good, being from MA, I'm kind of picky. My husband really liked the seafood bisque, not what I think of bisque, but tasty and had some seafood in it. The crab cake stuffed shrimp were kind of tiny, but the taste was good, and the clam strips were more like real clams than I have seen anywhere else on the west side of the country.

Overall, it was all really good. Anthony, our server, was excellent. I even knocked over my whole diet coke and didn't get an attitude. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"a seafood joint less than 2 minutes from my house in a neighborhood filled with chain restaurants and their kitchen is open 24/7 with daily and graveyard specials?
this pescetarian is as happy as a clam at high tide!  =D

i must admit, i had low expectations of shucks on my first visit.
i'd read all of the reviews, some by people i trust implicitly, so i was willing to give it a try, at the very least.
i was pleasantly surprised as the food was delicious and the service was friendly and accommodating.
i ordered the scallop sliders which are prepared on hawaiian sweet rolls!
imho, sliders should really only ever be served on hawaiian sweet rolls.
the scallops were tender and flavorful and the wasabi sauce has a nice little punch!
crunchy waffle fries on the side were yummy as well.

shucks has quickly become my neighborhood spot.
i've since ordered several different items and i've never been disappointed.
the mahi mahi is one of my favorite items on their menu.....prepared perfectly tender and flaky, served with wild rice and cooked veggies that are still crisp.

two of my biggest pet peeves: 
1. overcooked fish
2. soggy cooked vegetables
you won't find either of those here.

the prices are already extremely reasonable but the daily specials are where it's at.
tuesdays - $3 tacos
wednesdays - b1g1 sandwiches and wraps
thursdays - $1 oysters

i'm so glad i gave shucks a chance and even happier that they exceeded my expectations in every way.
i'm totally a fan!"}
{"text":"We went there for my dad's birthday (11 people) and it was the worst seafood we have ever had. It tasted like everything was previously frozen!

The calamari was overcooked, too chewy, the shrimp were slimy and smelly, and the crabcakes taste like they were previously frozen. The clams were overcooked and were sent back. 
The service was good but the food was terrible."}
{"text":"5 Stars! Not cause its a super duper fine dining place... but because it was great in food and experience. Yeah sure it's nothing to go Ape over, but I got everything I expected from this kind of place. Had some oyster shooters. Yum. Louisiana oysters... YUM YUM.

One thing I DO have to say is, they had the BEST snow crab I've ever had. The texture was good. Not mushy or cakey. Not super salty or watered down like the stuff you might find at buffets. And it had an awesome sweetness to it. I enjoyed it more than the lobster. And I love lobster over crab!

Great food. Check.
Good drinks... check...
...totally worth what you pay for.

I left the place like a fatty.

If you don't want crawfish but have a seafood craving.. go here.

It might not satisfy everyone... but this place now tops Hot & Juicy and Boiling Crab for me!"}
{"text":"Way back in the days when use to play my adult rec hockey games at the Las Vegas Ice Center over ten years ago or more.. Shucks was one of the team drinking spots after the games since literally right across the street. I only have found memories of the place. The beers reasonable price, laid back atmosphere, lots of televisions all around the bar area and dining area, and nice little diversity of food not just normal bar food. Since no longer play at the Las Vegas Ice Center not often drive around that area. Talk about bringing the throwback on St Patty Day. 

St Patty Day went out with my roommates for some drinks and food. We tried to do traditional Irish bar but really if looking for laid back atmosphere not the best idea. Shucks was close by our second miss. It wound up being ideal spot get our celebration on. The place was not crowded but few people in the spirit with full on green outfits and partying. Not crazy that we could have conversation without yelling at one another. 

Guess Friday they have this \"FIVE for $5\" from 8am-midnight on appetizers. So we got the calamari and crab & spinach dip start. The calamari was solid nothing that blow you away. It had nice breading, great seasoning, nice portion size (usually see specials make it smaller but our waiter told us normal size portion), and both dipping sauces was great. The crab and spinach was just ok for me. I could have done without. It great deal because we ordered two of the five items. 

My entree I ordered the oyster po boy. It was solid. The bread was on point. Nice crusty on the outside. The oysters they use nice size ones not huge or small. Just right cause last thing want small ones all dried out or big ones moist in the middle. The dressing along with the lettuce, tomato, and am sure missing couple other items. It all came together really nice. If looking for solid sandwich the po boy great choice."}
{"text":"Great price for the breakfast deal $4.99 chicken steak & eggs, friendly staff good food and price. Music is little loud. But it is a bar, what can you say right ??"}
{"text":"Wow seafood is great !oysters specials on thursday wonderfull .service was great found my new home!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years.  The food is delicious and reasonable, the atmosphere is relaxed, the service is above attentive and most importantly, it's a great family environmental including with small children. We went for breakfast AND dinner the recent thanksgiving as we were looking to maximize kid time.  There is a terrific kid menu and the portions for the whole menu are ample. The $5.00 appetizer menu is awesome.  Service always fast and cordial/warm, we have bought many friends along and they are grateful for the intro.  Its our regular place!  thanks to Victor and all the wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"Eh, not sure if I like this place or not. 

Thursday oysters for 1.50 were good. Large and cold. Too much cocktail sauce served with them. The other specials looked enticing but questionable. 

My drink was weak and pricy. 

No smoking in it. Bar or restaurant? Confusing.

Customer service was just ok. I like my bartenders  with a smile.. A little flirty too."}
{"text":"I liked the ambience of this place. It was very casual, but the food was terrible. I really dislike writing negative reviews, but this is a place I will never eat at again."}
{"text":"Feel duped by suspicious raving reviews.   Oysters were ok, prefer colder.  Atmosphere makes chili's or outback seem glamorous.  Service was mediocre at best.  Worst part was coincidently the most important, the food.  My wife ordered a bucket that cost around $20 and consisted of 9 counted shrimp and 12 clams that were drowned in butter and water.  I ordered a $25 dollar seafood platter that had seafood that rivaled long John silver's complete with store bought crab cakes.  Same price or more expensive than way better local joints with better seafood in town.  Other reviews must be friends of the owners.  For price, quality, and ambiance, giving two stars is fair, if not generous."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here strictly because it was rated 4 stars on Yelp and is right next to his house.   We all know when something is rated 4 stars on Yelp that it is truly trust worthy and this place is no different.  The clam strips that I shared with my friend were some of the best that I have had yet and I am from New England.  My taste for seafood is pretty hard to please.  The service was great from the 3 different people that approached our table and they genuinely seemed to care.  Thats always a plus.  My main meal that I enjoyed was Fish and Chips and it was prepared wonderfully.  The only downfall is that this place is a Chicago Bear's bar, but it can be overlooked to enjoy such good food.  :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! The food is great. The specials are wonderful. Haven't tried their drinks yet besides beer. Service is pretty good as well. This is going to become my new favorite spot.

Thursdays = $1 oysters! Other specials I remember:

Tuesdays = $3 tacos (the mahi mahi is the best! Chicken and steak was good as well)

Sundays = 1/2 off wine bottles

Those are the days I have gone so far. Ordered the clam bake on thursday and it was a decent portion. Flavor of it was great (picture posted) Also they have a burger special BOGO FREE with fries and $2 for draft - the burger was cooked perfectly with bacon, mushrooms, and cheese. Also had raw oysters and rockafeller (a bit small, but good flavor). Calamari was yummy. Shrimp ceviche was PHENOMENAL!

Reason for missing the 5th star.. well, parking was small and food takes a little while."}
{"text":"After reading such great reviews from you awesome yelpers, I knew I had to give this place a try. I looked at their menu and got so excited that I had to go that day. So I went to have a quick dinner with my bf last night around 9:30pm.

It wasn't too smokey or smelly inside, and it was a nice quiet day. We decided on the rockafeller oysters (6 per order) and they were delicious! Though the oysters were  bit small and it seemed there was way too much spinach for the amount of oyster, it somehow worked out! Great flavor.

And then we shared the ribs and shrimp combo. The ribs were great! Cooked perfectly and the sauce was yummy, it was a bit too saucy for me, but super yummy. And since I am a low-carber, I asked to sub the fries and slaw for a side salad. (Very fresh veggies). And we chose the garlic shrimp which was also delectable.

I must say, though, the server was a bit slow. He was the only one working the night shift and I guess he was tired, but there was only us and one other table...

I am going back Tuesday to try more yumminess. I will post pictures of the items I get! I'm excited to try their other stuff like the lobster fingers and clam bake and crab (which they ran out of when I was there)...

I highly recommend this place. I will probably make it a regular place to be."}
{"text":"Good quality Snow Crab Legs are hard to find outside of a Vegas buffet, and the ones on the buffets are usually knackered with pre-scored cuts to make eating 'easier' but take the fun out of cracking and pickin' the crab, which is half the fun IMO. I've been in the hunt for a non-buffet Snow Crab spot. Not even Costco sells Snow Crab (at least 11.5 months out of the year...)

Have eaten at Shucks twice in the past week, the first time I ordered a pound ($17.90/pound) of Snow Crab, it came out Grade A quality: color, size and taste. Impressive! Pressed my luck a few days later and was served a Grade B quality crab :( Still better than the crab available at the neighborhood Smiths/Kroger/Albertsons (Grade C: $6.99/pound) but disappointing that the 2nd visit wasn't consistent with the first. Also, the side of roasted red potatoes on the 2nd visit were slightly under-roasted. Just substitute for their Burger-King-style, twice-fried fries instead, and you'll be OK: these are delicious.

Love that Shucks is open 24 hours and non-smoking. A direct view of the televisions is a slight challenge from some of the seating areas, so get there early before the big game. Half-price draft beers on certain NFL nights is a solid deal ($2-$3 per pint)."}
{"text":"So this was the WORST  service I've ever had here. I live around the corner and this is my favorite place to go to. But I'm seriously considering goin to timbers next time. 
I usually order food and hang out with friends. Tonight we all  ordered appetizers and entrées, had a few drinks. Built up a pretty big bill. But still we were having a good time. Our server was nice and she was cute. Had a nice smile. She could have come around to check on us a bit more often but what ever that's ok with us. She got what ever we needed fast so that's all that counts. 
She ended up leaving before we were done and told us to go to the bar for anything we needed. Ok sounds easy. NOT!
The bartender wes a freaking asshole. We're trying to get our checks (my BF is trying to get them) and the bartender is giving him attitude about what's on what ticket. He doesn't know he was at the bar gambling most of the time. So I walk over and began to try and fix things. My BF turns around and walks away and the bartender throws his arms up and makes a face. (Like woah wtf) so I'm trying to work with the guy he prints up the ticket and throws it to the side then he walks of mumbling something and goes serves other tables. HELLO! I'm trying to get out and pay my bill. (Witch for the table was around $120) after he was done gave us a list of tickets we paid before he could even make drinks for other people. 

Needless to say leaving took way longer then it should. Service was shit at the end. Food was ok. Overall I haven't left a place this upset in a long time. Ugh. Good luck."}
{"text":"I will never go here again! The worst oyster Rockefeller ever! And I only went to order to go and it was as if I was an inconvenience! And the soup was a thick paste no way a bisque! I wasted my $40 for real"}
{"text":"Late night pick up for me and hubby, not super into seafood but he loves it, chicken finger and chicken wings Delish!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and my son and myself eat here about twice a month. We have tried several different things on the menu from Sandwiches to pasta to fish and seafood. The portions are good, and the food is always hot and fresh. The prices are very reasonable and your service will be prompt and friendly. If you have not eaten here you are missing out on the jewel of Flamingo Road."}
{"text":"Oh my Gosh! This place was so good! Oyster Rockefeller, Clam chowder, clam linguini, and now the the apple pie with a scoop of ice cream, all was sooo good! Definitely worth a 2nd or even a 3rd trip to come here. Pretty close to the house so that's good cause the Cucumber 'Chelda' is doing a number now. But was all so worth the price."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place until I found 4 hairs in my food...
The first couple times that I ate here, the food was really good and I was very impressed.  Then on the 3rd visit I ordered the fried shrimp basket to go and while eating I noticed not 1, but 4 black hairs in my food and one was even wrapped around the shrimp.  So I called the restaurant the next day to speak with a manager and left a detailed message as to what happened, and wouldn't you know... I never got a return call.  So its safe to say that this joint is officially off the list."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food, oyster rockafellas tasted warmed up and everything was slightly cold when it was suppose to be hot . Also the shrimp cocktail had no flavor it was gross, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great seafood! Great service! Good beer!
I love their Friday happy hour menu! $5 mussels! Can't beat that!!!! Also they have other happy hour menus for different days of the week. 
I do not recommend their lobster roll or cioppino. Too thick of a soup base. BUT everything else has been great! Even their steaks! 
The servers are always very knowledgable and friendly. Just don't expect exceptional service if their busy, just like any other busy place!!! Have patience when their busy and you will have a great experience. The highlight of all my dining experiences always comes down to the food! And their food is yummy!!!!!!!!!!
Oh and their oysters are fresh and delish!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place right next to my house and everyday they have a special !!!! Oysters crab legs whatever you're in the mood for this is the place to be very chill great environment super clean"}
{"text":"I love this place all the food is soo good and they have good prices and is a nice place to go with the family and friends"}
{"text":"This is the only place I have ever been to that charges a to go charge . Which is so totally absurd. I called in my order, went to pick up my order and I notice the charge. The girl told me it is a to go charge. They charge you 50 cents for every container they put your food. Then I got home and they gave me the wrong food. I will never go back. Fuck them bitches!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'd rate this place as decent.  Not great but not to bad.  The service was good but the quality of the food left me with more to desire."}
{"text":"Excellent Sevice, Delicious Food, cozy atmosphere and reasonable prices!:)AW"}
{"text":"This place used to be a go-to for late night food n drink, but dang, its slipped bigtime. Always dead, and bartender won't even honor their past daily specials anymore.  Not worth going to!!!"}
{"text":"Disgusting. Food and service was bad. Oysters were strange and not cold at all. A pitcher of beer here costs more than a dozen of their crappy oysters. I also found a dead fly in my beer cup which I should have taken a picture of as proof."}
{"text":"No Smoking anywhere! Love love love it. They offer $2 drafts on Monday and Wednesday and a different daily dining special all week. This location is also a Dallas Cowboys bar so they offer food and drink specials during all the games. Some of the specials include $8 pitchers, $5 Texas teas and $1 oysters. They offer a lot more food specials during the games and a Bloody Mary bar starting at $6 for the 10am games. You might want to get there a little early for good seats. In my experience, it doesn't fill up but the seats in the bar area around the tv's are always scooped up pretty quick. There are a few tv's in the dining area as well but the view is not as good.

The service is average and the food is a little better than typical tavern fare. I recommend the Crab Stuffed Tilapia with vegetables and wild rice. It's a pretty tasty entree for around $15. And did I mention that there is no smoking, even in the bar?"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time here and it was even more amazing than the first. We got crab and spinach dip and calamari to start for only $5 each! Both were amazing. We added on a bowl of soup which was a little salty but good. Then for meals we had the shrimp platter and crab stuffed tilapia. Both were amazing. The time it took to get our food was amazingly fast. We had numerous waiters and waitresses always checking in on us. This place is a must go!!! Only down side is its a little noisy."}
{"text":"Decent place, I don't know what all the bad reviews are for. Service was good. Food was good. We ordered seafood jambalaya which you can get with either rice or pasta, we ordered it with pasta. It was a huge amount. And tasted fine not great but fine. Also ordered Dungeness crab, fried oysters with a side of garlic fries, very good. The oysters came with a nice size helping of coleslaw, I'm not a huge fan of coleslaw but I tasted it and it was good. Crab legs came with red potatoes. All good."}
{"text":"I had the Tuesday Taco special. You can order any taco for $3. I had the Mahi Mahi, and shrimp. My fiance gave me a chunk of Tuna as well.

Get the Tuna first. It was cooked perfectly. The Mahi Mahi was also good, but you notice there isn't enough of the sauce on the taco.

The shrimp is the worst. It is chopped up pieces of shrimp that have almost no flavor. It is like chewy annoyances in a flour tortilla. 

Please give patrons a corn tortilla option and put a little more sauce in the taco."}
{"text":"Service here isn't what it was, but still a decent place. Prices are reasonable and the food is above average. Wednesday is buy one get one free on burgers and sandwiches ."}
{"text":"We came here at 2am after a night on the town because this place is 24 hours, but we would have been better off at IHOP or Denny's.  The overnight worker there was incredibly testy and rude.  We did nothing to provoke him other than walk through the door.  I mean I get it if he doesn't like working the night shift, but don't take it out on the customers.  The only reason I give this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because the food was good.  I ordered the fish and chips, which was crispy and not over-battered.  But the food did not make up for the terrible service.  Some of my friends felt so uncomfortable that they did not want to order anything.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I will not be going to this place again."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  Service was great!  Restaurant has a comfy relaxed vibe.  The food is phenomenal!  I got the oysters, clams and a black and bleu salad...everything was delicious!  First time, but not my last!"}
{"text":"My first visit here was a couple of years ago, I met a girlfriend for a late night snack. Sat at the bar and had some chicken wings which I enjoyed. 

Second visit was at the Durango location after leaving work at Centennial Hills Hospital. I was craving for country fried steak so I called ahead and ordered to go for the whole family. It was late and their doors were locked and you have to be buzzed in. I sat at the bar and waited for them to prepare 6 country fried steaks which didn't take very long. He even helped me to my car. I would order from here again if I get out early and hungry for breakfast. 

Third visit was at the Flamingo location. My boys and I came from Christmas Town and this was the closest I had bookmarked. Parked right in front and sat ourselves in a booth. It wasn't too busy, you guys know I like that :-) We all ordered a raspberry lemonade and ordered the crab spinach dip right away (too salty) while we decided our entrees.

I didn't enjoy the jambalaya I ordered, it wasn't spicy at all. The chicken alfredo, my 14yr old didn't finish so we took it home. Now the Schucks burger was very much liked. My 11yr old wanted to order another one! Hold on there tiger, that's enough for you today lol"}
{"text":"Expertly crafted late night and midnight menus still available!

One bartender is great, female, there is a bartender graveyard who cussed me out because I called him out in his rudeness. I even complained to management the following day. I still will frequent this joint because of their amazing 24hour deals."}
{"text":"Don't get the carry out cat fish. Under cooked not crispy at all. Cold frys. Big hunk of fish sitting in grease. 21 usd for that with 4 shrimp which were over cook. Sorry."}
{"text":"Just had the calamari, and it was dry and chewy. It tasted old, it seems like they changed the recipe to their calamari. Very disappointed, I will not be eating here in the near future."}
{"text":"Although I miss Ashley tremendously she was our server for more than 5 years. My family and I frequent Shucks at least once a week for either dinner or breakfast and the food is always excellent. I would highly recommend this establishment for dinning."}
{"text":"For years I have driven past Shuck's and wondered just what was going on inside the place.  From the outside it is certainly a curious structure with an almost abusive amount of signage and a corrugated metal sort of look.  You really don't even know what to expect inside.  Answer is, you shouldn't expect much.  On top of sporting the same decoration as likely slapped on in the early 1980s, this place is a Dallas Cowboys-devoted sports bar.  For some of us, that will hurt your appetite.  

So why did I only ding the rating one star for such an assault on a girl via ambiance?  Shuck's food is is really disturbingly good.  We were guessing it would either be super sketchy or really good.  Thank god it was the latter.  Their menu is a curious collection of laminated pages and their claim of oysters just lists them in quantity, not type.  No one should come in expecting a raw bar experience.

You should expect really good oyster shooters and lots of them.  There are three types, of which we chose the Barracho, essentially a traditional tequila shot complete with salt and lime.  Added to the happy hour order ($5) of peel-and-eat shrimp (NOTE: they give you a spot of very nice horseradish which was excellent and unexpected), this makes for an excellent start.  Also, the martinis are half price during happy hour and without a doubt it was one of the best shaken martinis i have had in recent memory.  I am often disappointed.

Our server was quick and on top of our table with the perfect combination of food/drink delivery, plate swipes and privacy.  It was impressive.

Lastly, our food could not have been better.  The cheeseburger was perfection.  The right amount of bun softness and practically perfect ratio of melted cheese to meat patty with right amount of doneness.  The thin-cut French fries were straight out of the handbook of how to make perfectly cooked potatoes. And my steak was done precisely to my order.  You would think this would be easy, but to get differing meats done correctly and delivered on time seems to be a problem for most places.  Shuck's nailed it.

I'm almost scared to go back.  Have you ever gone to a place and had such a good experience that you think it has to be a complete mistake?  However, the more I think about those tequila oyster shooters, the more I think I will be back sooner than later."}
{"text":"Well my dinner plans fell through somewhere else so my husband and I was driving around trying to figure out what to eat.....I didn't want TGIF or Chili's(you know...your typical chain restaurant) so I decided to
Look on Yelp for a spot that had seafood and this spot came up. The food was great and our waitress was really nice. I was little skeptical based off the reviews but decided to try it anyway! I wish it was a little brighter because it was too dark it other than that it was good....will go again!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but this is my opinion. I feel when you are working on tips, at least make a attempt to have customer service skills or a personality. When I have thousands of places to choose from in Las Vegas, please make me feel grateful I decided to spent my money here. What is sad is I left $5 tip and the server (Jonnae) doesn't even understand why.
My daughter and I ate here on March 1st and ordered the garlic fries, which were amazing. Tonight we ordered the garlic fries and it was missing the parsley. We mentioned this to Jonnae and her answer was, \"Oh it was just for decoration.\" Really, the pink flamingo in front yard is for decoration. How can you be inconsistent with the way you serve food in the same week?  Nothing like leaving a restaurant mad you spend your money there."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad at all, I just wish they had menu options that weren't sea food. Maybe some appetizers or something. The items are really limited if your like me and don't eat she'll fish"}
{"text":"Driven by many times but never Stopped until the Packers were playing the Seahawk's in the playoffs.  Felt odd since this is a Bears Bar but I knew it wouldn't be busy. 

I went for the Shrimp Platter which had fried popcorn, butterflied coconut, and plain ole fried shrimp.  The coconut milk dipping sauce was my favorite part.  Everything was delicious we had the spinach artichoke flat bread. Yummy!

The beer choice was pretty standard with your common big 3 Bud, Miller and Coors.

The burger looked huge. The Big Mother Shucker! No just kidding it had a different name but something along those lines. I will give that a try  next time.  As well as some oysters that they are know for."}
{"text":"I've been to this and the other location a few times. I've got to say that I'm surprised that I'm able to get good seafood from a bar. I love oysters so $1 oyster night on Thursdays is great to take advantage of. The service is decent enough. I mean it is a bar so I don't expect super tentative service or anything but the servers are always nice. The prices aren't too bad either. 

I had the lobster roll. Now it's not big chunks of lobster meat like I'm used to. It's a lobster salad (which it does state in the menu) with mayo and celery. However there is a good amount of meat in the roll and it is tasty. When given the option of fries I chose garlic. Those were very good as well. They use a fresh make garlic butter with minced garlic over the fries. As far as drinks go, my mother had a mandarin cosmo which was delicious. I've had good experiences with this place so far and will continue to come back."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I have experience eating here and got deathly ill. I kept giving this joint another chance and the food is so bad that food poisoning is always the result. Please check your expirations guys. This is not right!  Don't eat here unless of course you want to end up poisoned"}
{"text":"It's a really great place for seafood, especially late at night when all other options are closed.  It's nice to have a place like this in the Northwest area of Vegas, because it's still up and coming and the pickings on good restaurants aren't exactly numerous.

I had a daily special, and to be completely honest, I thought it was great.  The fried fish was soo good. Crispy on the outside, yet still tender and soft on the inside."}
{"text":"I come here a lot and I love it! The first time I came here, I hit my first 5 spot playing Keno (I'm not old... I swear)! The first time I came here was a little off though. We didn't get ID'd from a blond server. I would understand if we looked over 30 but I'm 21 and Chris is 24. The server with the red hair is amazing! She is great at recommending food, drinks, and just fun to talk to! I wasn't too fond of Doug at first, but he's really great to me now! 

There is smoking in this bar so don't come in here and complain about that. Most bars have smoking anyway. It's opened 24 hours too which is a huge plus being down the street! It's right across the street from Smiths on N. Durango and Elkhorn. I think it's cool that they have an ATM inside as well! 

Now for food. The bacon wrapped shrimp ($8.95) is to die for. The bacon is crispy and has this amazing smokey taste to it. The shrimp in this dish are huge as well! The Wild West burger ($10.95) is really good. Huge sized burger and extremely juicy. It comes with a side of fries! Their garlic fries are my favorite. It is extremely garlicey so just a heads up. If you don't like garlic, obviously it isn't meant for you. Their mashed potatoes are really good too but you need to add a lot of salt to it. Onion rings are the thicker cut ones (my favorite style) and it's extremely crispy. Their shrimp tacos were a little disappointing to be honest. If you're going to get tacos, get their chicken ones. Those ones were amazing! I love the fish n chips here! ($11.95) Again their portioning sizes for everything are huge. I just thought it was a little heavy on the stomach. My favorite food wise is their pasta dishes. The portions are huge! The scampi ($13.95) was amazing. It has so much flavor in it. Perfectly cooked noodles as well. The seafood fra diavolo plate (18.95) is all over the place, but in a good way. There's so much going into this dish. You get your shrimp, clams, scallops, and mussels in a huge plate. The sauce is a little spicy too, it adds such an amazing flavor. The scallops in that were my favorite! Their shrimp Alfredo (14.95) is my favorite dish here, but keep in mind that I haven't separately gotten oysters or clams yet. They actually put a good amount of shrimp in it, it's so cheesy and delicious. It's not as thick as most places make it but it's still a heavy dish. It comes with a piece of toast on it as well. Their french toast on their breakfast menu is amazing! You get that with ham, bacon, and sausage for just $5! It's well worth it and filling as well. I love their chicken fried steak and eggs. $6.95 for that. The steak is a little small but the gravy is perfectly seasoned. Honestly the prices are worth it for everything I've tried here.

All in all I love it here. The service is great no matter who it is, the food is definitely worth the prices! Has to be one of my favorite places to go."}
{"text":"Tried to give this bar another chance, and they found another way to make it even worse. We ordered two martinis other than taking a lot time to bring them they were a total joke, see picture. Never again, horrible service."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times, and the place has never let us down! Whether we have the crabs, a sandwich, or pasta, it has been delicious. We get the oysters On the Half-Shell every time we go! Good service, and decent prices"}
{"text":"Dude WTF Guys.  You let me down. This place officially sucks.  Your oysters made me vomit, and the crab made my ass piss.  In the past I've had many a great experience, but the last couple times this has simply not been the case.  I didn't want to believe it at first when I found myself spewing chunks of rotten oyster flesh in to the toilet.  I thought eh I just got a bad batch.  So I gave them a second chance,\"F*ck me right\" I live less than two miles away and I found myself clenching my butt cheeks for dear life half way home. As I sat their, my ass securely suctioned to the toilet seat i vowed to never have another ass pissing experience at Shucks.  F you Dude. F you."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite Friday night date place. Not so much anymore. 

Staffs speaks poorly about each other to the customers. 

Bread Bowls are ALWAYS burnt. ALWAYS. 
-Also happened to vomit mine back up 7 minutes after eating half of it. 

Calamari fell apart. It was not prepared before fried properly. 

Service is slower nowadays and the food overall has just gone WAY DOWNHILL. Very sad."}
{"text":"Always come here for late bite.  Service is super friendly all the time and foods great at a good price."}
{"text":"By far the best oysters ever.  They have great food and great dills.  The customer service is amazing and I would and have gone back plenty of times.  If your in the mood for a good sandwich or great oysters please visit this place.  It's a neighborhood place but so worth the visit."}
{"text":"Just not really my thing personally. 

Service is good, food is OK but nothing stellar. Price is about right. Came here a second time for their lamb but it tasted so-so this second go-around. 

The crab is alright, my sister-in-law seemed to enjoy it. 

The lunch size pastas is probably your best bet in terms of banging for your buck. Other than that, the fried shrimp platter -- not so much. Buffalo wings weren't bad, and neither is the tuna tartare...

Best part? Dessert.  Cookies and cream sandwich, Key lime pie, or the cheesecake eggroll.

I would come here again if I was asked to, but I don't think I'll ever be on the hunt for it. Again, just not my thing."}
{"text":"I just got done eating here and I was very impressed with the value.  They run a two for one hamburger special everyday Which is awesome.  
The burgers were good and not dry like at other places in town.
There beer and bar food selections were great also.  Would recommend to anyone on a budget"}
{"text":"Great place to meet friends, have a conversation and enjoy a great meal.  We had a top notch dinner that would've been 3 times the price on the Strip.  I had the jambalaya pasta and carrot cake...delicious.  It's an oyster place (with smokin' horseradish sauce) and very fresh oysters) but wish there was fresh fish on the menu too.  Great choice for us...we'll be back.  (Restroom was clean and the health dept gives them an \"A\" with zero demerits.)"}
{"text":"The food is gross. Probably a better sports bar--where you get wasted enough to eat their food. I gave it two stars because I went there hungry, so hungry I ate most of the lobster roll AKA imitation crab roll with a little sprinkle of lobster bits. It's an oyster bar that does not even have good oysters. I was hoping it would be a good small seafood restaurant, but no. But like I said, probably just a good sports bar."}
{"text":"Great bar, food is amazing for a seafood specialty bar. Pricing is great and their breakfast food / late night menu is great!!!"}
{"text":"Good crab legs and fried shrimp! Didn't like the cole slaw, but over all I will be returning l!"}
{"text":"Was not impress with this place. 

We were at Centennial Hospital awaiting for our sis in law to deliver our little bundle of joy, Rylan. We were all so famished I Yelped the area and found this place. seafood bar?! Uhh yaaaaas! 

Upon arriving I really had a good feeling about this place. Maybe I ordered wrong but I also had a taste of everyone's else dish and I wasn't impressed.

I ordered the Seafood pan roast. Okay, so I may be bias but I am IN LOVE with oyster bar pan roast so my exceptions were probably a little too high. But the flavors just didn't not go well. The soup had a sweet creamy taste to it that I didn't recognize. The seafood that was in it was just not up to par. Just basically lots of clams and a few fish chunks. The rice, I don't even know what kind of rice that was. It defiantly was not the typical rice I'm used to. 

My friend got the Gumbo. She never had gumbo before so she thought it was good. But the flavors just was really off. Even the waitress said she didn't really like the Gumbo. I agree with her. 

My other friend got the Philly cheesesteak and the meat came out extra dry. 

The beau got Steak and crabs. Now that was pretty good. I actually ate most of his crabs. I love crabs with extra lemon butter. That was amazing. The seasoning on the steak was different though, it had a Mexican feel to it kinda like carne asada. Wasn't bad just different. 

The drinks were ... Alright. My friend had to send her margarita back because it tasted like water. The 2nd margarita wasn't any better but she got it blended and didn't want to complain anymore. The waitress was pretty nice though very helpful. 

Reviews raved about the 1$ oysters... Unfortunately I don't eat oysters!"}
{"text":"Another tasty Seafood Louie.  Never disappoints.  I will keep coming back :)    The Seafood seems very fresh, even though we are in Las Vegas

One more picture of my favorite salad"}
{"text":"We've returned here for a good fish dinner many times, and we've never been disappointed.  I am a HUGE fan of their lobster sticks.  OMGawd, so tasy and perfectly cooked.  We also had the coconut shrimp skewers and calamari.  Equally delish!   The ambience is just perfect, no need to dress up or feel under dressed.  There is plenty of parking and always get seated right away.  On Tuesday nights, they have some sort of Painting Class on one half of the restaurant, which is a big draw for the ladies.  I've experienced this paint class thing at other restaurants, so it must be a trend."}
{"text":"All around good seafood well most times. Had a pound of crab but it was bits and pieces not happy tonight."}
{"text":"I will NEVER eat at Shucks again!

Arrived on a Saturday evening and took a seat at the side bar.

After being ignored or should I say not noticed for about ten minutes the bartender comes over and asked if I would like something to drink. I order a drink and take a look at the menu. I order my dinner, after the bartender takes my order she comes right back to verify she had it correct before it was entered into the computer. On one hand I appreciate that she wanted to input it correctly, but maybe she should have written it down. 

When my dinner is delivered it is delivered by someone from the kitchen who just puts a plate of food in front of me. No regard to if I would like anything else or if everything looks ok. The food was so, so. I had much better in the past. One step above Red Lobster.

After I finish, another fifteen minutes go by and I'm sitting with an empty plate and waiting for my check. My plate is removed and another ten minutes goes by before I'm given my check. Once my check arrives I pay in cash and have to wait another ten minutes before my change is returned. I was beginning to wonder if the bartender was going to assume that my change was a tip and never return it to me the customer. 

What upsets me the most is all the time I'm sitting at the bar area in front of the walk way in and out of the kitchen. People are constantly walking back and forth with no regard or level of service to their customers. From what I could observe, one bartender was on duty to service the entire main bar and side bar area alone. One wait person to service the restaurant and seating area solo again. One mediocre manager on duty who spent more time talking to a female customer than managing the operation. This so called manager did no managing, the tables are dirty, your customers are not being serviced in a timely manner. What do  you do other than flirt with female customers?

Their business must be suffering and trying to save money on payroll by understaffing the entire restaurant.  Your not saving money if your not servicing your customer properly and upsetting them to the point of not returning. 

Obviously, the only thing keeping this bar alive is the revenue from the video poker machines not the food or service."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Been eating here since 2010 but haven't been in about a year.  No special reason, just been busy.  Stopped by today on a whim and picked up seared tuna, crab stuffed tilapia, shrimp and rice and some raw oysters.

Wow, it was great.  All of it.  Especially the oysters, big and meaty.  Won't be a year before we go back! Thanks Shucks, good job."}
{"text":"This place is within walking distance to my new place so of course I had to give it a try :-) I'm so glad I did! The food is good...I mean I was shocked how yummy the bar food was! A million tv's to watch whatever sport game thats on....fyi it's all about the bears in here though. I kinda only really care about watching the SF Giants play baseball, niner fan by default...but football I really watch for kicks and giggles no real loyalty so I'm not offended at the all Bears stuff ;-) 

Anyways back to my point...the food is wonderful! The food is good, prices are great and well, they remembered us when we come back :-) and I have a soft spot for any place that remembers their repeat customers...as we left they even offered us a water bottle to go :-) Kudos people! Love the place, love I can walk to it, love I can chill have some drinks and walk my bum back home :-)"}
{"text":"We were craving for oysters and wanted to try them out at shucks. Not the kind of seafood restaurant I was looking for, but we still give it a shot. The place is kinda old and smell like rotten towel. The server was nice and friendly though. We went on a Sat and they were having a Sat deal on the clam bake for 21.95 (original price is 26.95). We also ordered a dozen of oysters and they were just okay.  The clam was huge, had at least 20 clams, 5 crab legs, spicy sausages, corn, and potatoes.  They were delicious, especially the clams. The clams were so juicy and meaty. We could hardly finish all the seafood they packed into the bowl. We left most of the potatoes and corn untouched. If we knew the clam bake is that big, we probably would not have ordered the oysters."}
{"text":"Good service Mickey and Larry are two of the best bartenders/servers in Las Vegas! If you like good seafood I recomend this place over Joe's Crab Shack anyday. Their fresh shrimp appetizers and sauce rule and the mahi mahi tacos are real delicious. Keep in mind they can blacken any food you like. I have literally seen people partyin and having a good time here then eat some nachos then fall into a food coma right after they finished their beer and meal. I travel for a living and this place is right off the freeway on my way home from McCarran Airport and it is the place I always stop for a good meal. Also like to mention a very mix class of people that go here. I have seen retired couples to biker groups and night club promoters at this place. It's nice check it out."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. We like tavern-like atmosphere and the bar area is pretty cool. Very good service tonight. We had the crab cake app and they seem like the frozen ones u can buy at the store, but they were fried nicely. Presentation was very nice. The crab cake sauce and the cole slaw were really good. I ordered a 1/2 dozen of raw oysters and had to ask for saltines because they had a strong, fishy taste. Tried them with the crackers but they were still way too fishy to enjoy. Like 'bad seafood' fishy. Tried my best but couldn't finish them. Got a little nervous. I've had my fair share of oysters for almost 30 years in Louisiana and I've never had a strong, 'not good' fishy flavor experience like that. I was let down. It could possibly be that they were frozen when they weren't fresh and defrosted, or the fact that they just might not have been fresh tonight. Not sure. Might have been an off night or just a fluke thing. Hubby had the fried shrimp basket with fries. The shrimp were ok. I guess we're spoiled with good gulf shrimp and authentic fried seafood platters. The french fries and cocktail sauce were really good. 

Going back to the other times we went.. 
The first time, I had the gumbo. It wasn't authentic or tasty and I didn't finish that either. Took a few bites and was done. It might be good to someone who hasn't had La. gumbo before or someone who likes the boxed/bagged gumbo mix flavor, but it's not for me. The second time we went, I had the fried oyster poboy and it was good. The poboy bread was nice from what I can remember. I'm pretty sure it was on french bread. I just remember liking it. Hubby had the shucks burger and he enjoyed it. It was filling and tasty. 

We'll probably be back for the atmosphere, drinks and maybe I'll try the Oysters Rockefeller or the baked New Orleans oysters. Might also try something recommended on Yelp. Won't have the jambalaya because we're used to authentic cajun jambalaya and authentic creole jambalaya.. but to some it might be really good. Overall, not bad. Just have to figure out what floats your boat at a place like this."}
{"text":"A trip back in time for me.  Nearly 10 years to the day my friend and I are back at Shucks.  We used to live up the street and this was our goto spot for some VP, beer and food.  Is it me or is this place now smoke-free?  If that is the case...THANK YOU !

I had the Mahi Mahi tacos and they were outstanding!  There must have been half a pound of mahi mahi in those two tacos...OK I'm likely exaggerating and clearly didn't have a scale with me but those things were stuffed full of nice quality fish. I'd venture back up here just for those tacos. Bar service was a little slow but once things got rolling with the food and the comp'd beers they had it all dialed in. Glad to see you guys are still around...keep up the good work and quality food."}
{"text":"Stopped by today for lunch after deciding against Krazy Sushi and I have to say it was a GREAT decision. It was a little pricey but everything was so good! Started with oysters on the half shell... They were perfect! The had the chose 4 and did x2 on the peel and eat shrimp, the Rockefeller oysters, and the calamari. Everything was great! The calamari had just the right amount of breading to not be overbearing and was fried perfectly! My lunch was so yummy!"}
{"text":"FUN SPOT!!!
Met some friends after work, and we had pretty good apps and food.
I could totally see going here and just having fresh seafood apps - Oysters, Crab Cocktail, peel & eat shrimp. MMMMMMMM

We did have a plate of oysters, and they were fresh and yummy. Also ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp. They were good, a TINY bit on the dry side. Fried Calamari was OK. The steamed garlic muscles were great, whish it had come with some toast points for the broth.

On the night we went, it was $3 taco night. I ordered 3 tacos. They were completely fine, definitely not amazing. My friends ordered pasta dishes (Vodka Scallops and Shrimp Scampi) and really liked them!

I discovered that Friday is $5 app night! I think next time I am going to hit it and just stick to the apps and fresh seafood. That seems to be the key here.

BUT- Saturdays is 2-for-$20 Pasta Night, so you may be inspired to go try the pastas that my friends loved!

Either way, the room is fun and rustic, the staff was super friendly, and we had a blast socializing! Just wish the food was a bit better."}
{"text":"Many years ago we were at this restaurant and did not find it good enough for a return visit. A few months ago we ate at the Shucks on Flamingo and it was delicious so when our friends suggesting having dinner here on Saturday we were really looking forward to it. Unfortunately this one on Durango is not as good as their other one.

We ordered the New Orleans Oysters which we had also had at their other restaurant but these were not nearly as good. My husband had blackened catfish and I had the clams appetizer and we both found our meals very bland. 

Our friends had the fish fry and they enjoyed their meals.

If we were to try it again we would go back to the one on Flamingo."}
{"text":"We were on vacation in New Orleans in November and this place has a very large and very varied menu including many of the things we had in The Big Easy.  We started with Orleans Style Oysters baked with garlic butter and parmesan cheese and they were almost as good as the ones we had in New Orleans.  Then my husband had New England clam chowder in a bread bowl while I just had a cup of soup.  It was very tasty but could have had a little more clams.  Then we shared linguini and clams in a white wine sauce which they split for us and each of our portions was tremendous.  My husband really enjoyed it as I did but I thought the pasta was a little to soft (I like my pasta al dente).

Will definitely be back here as I would like to try something from the Bucket List"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived at Shucks. I'm from New England, and it's certainly difficult to find decent seafood joints in Las Vegas. This place has a good feeling, local dive, but clean. The service has always been friendly. I usually go for cold oysters and beer/wine, but definitely enjoy other selections. The stuffed shrimp appetizer is very good, I often find myself scraping the dish for the last of the mushrooms and rice/butter. Crab legs are fun, and this is the first place I've ever eaten dungeness crab, pretty good! I only wish they had Alaskan King crab! The mix and match of cold/hot plates is always a great idea if you can't decide and feel like sharing, too. This is my go-to seafood bar :-)"}
{"text":"I love this place...even knowing that they're a Dallas Cowboys bar.

Their food is amazing, their prices are more than reasonable, their drinks are fresh and tasty and I've never had bad service from their staff.  I highly recommend this place as a seafood dive with a great bar and sports atmosphere."}
{"text":"Holy tamale batman.  Their combo plate is gargantuous.  You should have a few people to share it with.  The lobster fingers are melt in your mouth scrum-dilly-umptious.  The clam strips were pretty sandy and I coudn't really eat many of em.

Even though I'm reviewing the one on N Durango - my kickball team is sponsored by the one on Flamingo/215 and they have super yummy crab stuffed shrimp and good beer specials.  :)"}
{"text":"Still so good, we ate there twice in three days. Lobster roll with lots of lobster salad - light, not gooey - with a little lettuce on a great sub roll. Tater tots and garlic fries (ask for them; I didn't see them listed on the menu). Oysters rockefeller which all oyster lovers will appreciate. Snow crab sold by weight. Delicious seafood pasta. We could not have been happier!"}
{"text":"We've loved Shucks for a long time at the other location (and also the location that closed a few years back). About the Durango location, I can add they bend over backward to please the customers! 

We had a marvelous lunch. As starters, we shared a bowl of their fantastic, peppery, creamy clam chowder with lots of chunks of clam and a good clam flavor. Next, oysters Rockefeller -- a delicacy you can't get many places. Add a splash of lemon and enjoy. The shrimp cocktail contained seven huge, fresh, delectable shrimp with a very pleasant cocktail sauce. 

The Big Mothershucker (yes, you read that right) is perhaps the best burger you will ever eat. Share it unless you are insanely hungry -- it contains a full pound of hamburger plus much more. The combination of ingredients is so good! 

On top of all this deliciousness, the item that blew me away this time  was garlic fries. At last, a place that realizes garlic is not a word to be whispered delicately, but an elation to be freely enjoyed! The garlic was delicious even on its own. The fries were fantastic. How do they do it? What a meal. 

As if that were not enough, Monday is $2 domestic draft day. There are different special items every day. They've also got great pasta, crabcakes, all sorts of crab, shrimp, oh man. If seafood is your thing, this is the place. If seafood is not your thing, this is still the place!"}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday and everything was fantastic. Our server was Nicki and she was awesome. She was friendly, personable, and recommended items that turned out to be excellent. They have a really cheap priced kids menu (you have to ask about it). My son had chicken fingers and fries. They have like 4 different French fry options. My hubster loves oysters and she recommended we come back for the dollar oysters on Thursdays. I had the ginger soy scallops with baby bok choy and rice, hubby had 1/2 dozen Texas oysters (steamed with tequila, lime & Tabasco), the lobster roll with waffle fries and 2 oyster shooters.   We plan to go back kid free and sit at the bar once college and NFL sports season begins."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. 
We had the crab legs, ginger scallops and the crab spinach dip (mediocre) 

The late night bar tender was horrible. Inattentive, slow, unhelpful.

We went in and he was less than inviting. But I was stuck on getting my grub on. 

We spent about 2 hours or more at this location and I was able to get a complete observation of this bartender and the impact he's having on late night business. You should really consider hiring someone with more personality! It will go a long way! 

Also, I may be a little bias because we have our spots and they take care of us, but after 6 drinks and 2 shots you would think two good looking females could get SOMETHING comped. Like maybe a bottle of water? But he charged us for that too. I mean, I get it, we pay for what we order, but we had to order the water twice. So there's that. I don't care how that sounds.

Bottom line you need a friendly bartender because this guy is bad for business. He didn't chat to any of the customers, he left our food in front of us for a half hour after we were finished. He didn't ask us if we wanted refills. 

Nexxxxxxt bar!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I don't post unless I receive extraordinarily good service/food or extraordinarily bad service/ food or whatever it may be. Therefore I post very infrequently. Shucks is where I always go when I get a craving for seafood or any kind of fish. Their food has never disappointed. However tonight stands out and I have to post. I live approximately 10 miles away. When I arrived I told the bartender Brooke, that I wanted to get some food to go and a drink while I was waiting. And then I realized that I had forgotten my wallet. I informed Brooke of my dilemma. I have never met her before and I am probably more than twice her age. She told me to order what I wanted and she would cover me until I got home and called her back with my card info so I wouldn't have to drive all the way back to pay! Now who does that? Thank you Brooke! Great service, great food, five stars!"}
{"text":"Great seafood, inexpensive, with great service. Now to the down side, very smokey   even in the dining side, also very busy on the weekends. Will definitely still go back."}
{"text":"First time trying Shucks and unfortunately will never be returning. Now I can not speak for the bar service as my experience was in the sit down family portion. 

When we arrived it was seat yourself. We sat for about 5 minutes with many servers on the floor and no one came up to us. We were next to the hostesses table so we ended up grabbing our own menus after a couple more minutes of waiting. Finally someone came up after about 10 minutes to see if we had been helped. The first person we encountered asked if the \"two\" of us wanted to order our drinks. Never once asking about a drink for our 3 year old daughter (I guess she was invisible). Next we had a different server come take our order. No personality what so ever and very unpleasant. No smile, nothing. You could tell she was not in a good mood. Other than one other time it was the only time we saw her our whole meal. When done our meal we waited for the waitress to bring our check. There was not one person on the floor at this point (no clue where they all went). Finally after waiting some more we grabbed a bus boy and asked him to find our waitress so we could get the check. ** I will say the two bus boys we encountered during our meal were very nice! Too bad they were not waiters. They could teach that waitress a lesson in having a better personality. 

My boyfriend and daughter enjoyed their food. I got steak nachos, but something about the steak tasted weird so I ended up picking it all off. At that point I wasn't about to complain and wait for a new meal. While most the food we had was good it was nothing special to make me want to come back after the service I experienced. 

Now granted I know people have bad days, but unfortunately when your tip relies on giving your guests a good experience you need to learn to put that behind you. We did leave her a small tip as she did at least take our order, but that is all the tip covered.
 ** Just to be clear, per in the response below, as I don't think it was, we did not tip our waitress poorly due to slow service (that was just part of the review). It was her poor attitude and the experience she provided us that earned her her tip. Food and and food wait times are the restaurants doing, and we understand that. The experience and personality are all on the waiter/waitress."}
{"text":"Shucks is a solid place and always has been ( since i first went in 2007) I havent been to this location though, and to my surprise it was quality all around. Thursday happy hour 1$ oysters are a great deal although I must say, whoever shucked them, did so upside down... smh. Meaning the oyster was served on the flat (lid ) side of the oyster rather then the cup like side so there was no place for the oyster liquor (natural tasty broth) to go. Besides that I ordered a fried oyster po'boy and criss cut fries that were more then ample, served quickly and cooked to perfection. If you find yourself having an oyster fix one of these nights, i would for sure hit this place up. I mean, some times you just want a pint and some oysters after a late night, ya know? Well, i know I do."}
{"text":"I loved coming to shucks. Their food is amazing and drinks are strong. Well my friend and I spent three hours at Shucks eating and drinking. Had a great time the service was on point, our waiter was personable and funny,we had no problems. Well we went to go get our nails done and get boba. Before we left the plaza we thought well let's get our family some food to go, since the food was really good. We walked in and sat at the bar to get a quick to go order. We were handed a menu and told the server would be right with us. Then we waited and waited as a group of servers and management ignored us. No server ever came. Well as we were ready to storm out, pissed off from being ignored by the bar staff, victor came and saved the day. He took our order and apologized for the other staff. Who by the way were still ignoring us and walking by with out checking on us. I don't know if the staff was upset  because we had outside boba drinks with us or what. But being treated like second class citizens is not my thing. Victor the server is amazing and the only reason we stayed and placed a second order. But everyone else well they were jerks the second time around. I'll never  go back to Shucks or recommend this restaurant. And yes I got loud and made super snide comments and was still ignored. Bye forever lobster bites. Visit date 7/22/2016"}
{"text":"Service has a lot to be desired. If you like being ignored at the bar then you'll like it here. My boyfriend had crab cakes which he described as \"gross cakes\". Just ordered oysters Rockefeller one if my favorites! But at this \"oyster bar\" the oysters were the worst part I only ate 2 and finished the lackluster spinach due to extreme hunger just plain eww. 

I've been here before and ordered a spinach dip that was so cold in the middle I had to return it so they could heat it up, it wasn't any better warm though. This place has just been such a huge disappointment. It's walking distance from my house but I would rather drive to a bar that has better food and service. Sorry not sorry."}
{"text":"Gave this place another try and yet again was a huge BUST! Started with the appetizer Crab and Spinach Dip... TASTELESS is an understatement. Decided to try there \"Friday Fish Fry special\" and the fish was a total soggy mess. Literally falling apart and dripping with grease. I explained to the waiter my dissatisfaction and returned the plate. I was still charged for the meal even after returning the uneaten excuse for a meal. Never again"}
{"text":"Good place to get shucked up! The Shucks burger is great, crabs legs are just OK but the rest of the menu is legit. The atmosphere is pretty much standard for a bar, the lighting is just right for a relaxed atmosphere. Bartenders are always quick with an order and there is little to no waiting. This place is great!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to find this jewel in our backyard!  Had it not been for Yelp and all the reviews, we would still be looking for a good local fish house. The menu is terrific offering something for everyone!  Oysters, shrimp, halibut, cod, clams, crab, etc. All cooked as you like!  I had fish and chips, my husband had fried oysters, and we ordered an appetizer of fried clams. Oh, so good!  And, enough left over for lunch the next day!  Our server was so friendly and accommodating - she really made us feel welcome!  I can't wait to go back to our new \"regular\" fish house!"}
{"text":"Seriously, this place has an awesome cook! I try the fish and chips and my gosh orgasmic ;) so fresh and perfectly crispy. Also tried two tacos mahi and shrimp and guess what sooooo freakin bomb. I'm still craving that stuff in my mouth. And of course it's midnight and what do you do at midnight at shucks you may ask!!?? You attack the shit out of the $1 oysters raw or rocker fella oh em gee awesome !! 
Btw the steak is delish just saying steak n eggs babay! Lol"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is decent: however, everywhere you sit you can see right in to the kitchen.  The food portions were a good size and the food temperature was hot.  The taste was average.  The service was good and accommodating."}
{"text":"Yummy crab legs at great prices!! I thought the oysters were a little slimy but my hubs loved them!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent!!.  Oysters, not so.

We went there for oysters (table for 10).  One of my friends said they should drop the \"h\" out of their name.  The oyster's had zero \"oyster liquor\" in them.  Usaully a sign of not so fresh oysters.  They didn't have a \"mignonette\" sauce for the oysters or even know what it was when asked.  Other food was good to most of our party.  Below is a link to a simple mignotte recipe.

{"text":"The front of this restaurant faces a parking lot, with the back facing the road, so you have to be paying attention to find it. Once inside, it reads like a typical sports bar - smokey, lots of TVs, with half of the interior taken up by a dining area with some booths and low tables. The menu is EXTENSIVE. Usually not a great sign, but the food we got was acceptable. I had the Shuck's salad, which has a little piece of tuna, two shrimp, and a tiny scoop of crabmeat on a romaine salad with a vinaigrette dressing. It also came with a piece of cheesy texas toast on the salad which wasn't my thing. We also ordered the crab cakes, which in my opinion were small for the price. They tasted fine though, and the two came with a small salad of slaw in between them on the serving plate. No one got sick, extra point for that. My soda didn't ever get refilled though, so that was a minus. 

They have specials which are listed as you walk in, mostly things like X for half price on Tuesdays kind of thing. They also have rotating daily specials on a board inside the door. Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if I am in the area in the future and have deemed all other options less desirable, I might come back to try the crab legs since that seemed to be the most raved about menu item. Maybe I'm just not that used to eating in a bar where people are smoking and my server doesn't refill my drink, but given that, the food was just fine."}
{"text":"Solid performer. We find ourselves visiting for happy hour on Friday to take advantage of half-price martinis and $5 appetizers. The clam strips are 4-star or better, and the peel-and-eat shrimp are plump, firm, sweet and meaty. Perfect bar food. 

Wife loves the Lemon Drop martini and Mandarin Orange Cosmo. I made the mistake of ordering a 'real' vodka martini only to receive a glass full of well vodka, no detectable vermouth, and two olives. Had it been a decent vodka I would likely praise it, but it wasn't so I won't. .

The two problems I have with Shucks are the uninspired dining room (just an afterthought it appears) and the smokers in the bar.  Obviously a local hangout, and most are smokers. The ventilation cannot cope with the smoke; it's not like a haze hangs in the air but you can definitely smell cigarettes while anywhere at the bar.   You can move to the dining room to escape the smokers, but the dining room is the opposite of special or cozy and lacks ambiance of any variety."}
{"text":"Didn't go for their beer and didn't go for their oysters. 

After some strenuous exercise at the climbing gym, a few of us were hungry. But we're poor so we needed something cheap. And then my friend suggested Taco Tuesdays at Shucks! 

The place is pretty large with ample seating. It was pretty empty on a Tuesday night. Eerily quiet. We took our seats at a large table. Our server was quick to take our orders. 

A plate of two tacos usually run around $10. But each taco was $3 in which you can choose from shrimp, grilled mahi-mahi or your regular fried fish. We each got two tacos - the mahi-mahi and the regular fish taco. Food came out pretty quick. The tacos were pretty big, I thought they were going to be a lot smaller like the usual authentic 3-bite tacos. The plate also came with colorful chips and yummy salsa. Both tacos definitely hit the spot. Wasn't greasy or too heavy. 

I had to flag down our server for some more salsa and a refill for water. I was a tad disappointed because the place was so empty and I shouldn't be playing find-our-waiter when we were the only customers there. 

I took a peek at the rest of the menu. It seems a little bit on the pricey side. Maybe I'll come back next time to try their oysters. But for what they're charging, they better be amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is right next to my house. And I decided to try them. 
Pros: The service was good. They were willing to make me the drink off the menu, food was served fast. 
Cons: 
The raw oyster was not fresh at all, they smelled really bad and tasted fishy. This is kinda disappointing for a oyster bar. 
And Therefore, their oyster shooter wasn't good. 
The next thing we ordered was steamed clams. And again, they weren't great. I've had clams from different places and none of them were that fishy. 
For all reason above, I wouldn't recommend Shuck to nobody."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff. The crowd feels very neighbohood, as if they all know each other. Everyone is very welcoming and chatty. Not sure about the food, but bar atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Neighborhood bar with AMAZING food.  Don't go to the \"other\" fake freash seafood places.  This one is the real deal. Never had a bad meal here. The drinks are always perfect. Try the appletini. We even go here for breakfast since Vegas has a hard time figuring out a place for breakfast that stays consistant.   You won't be sorry. We love this bar."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Came here after work for some drinks, food and to watch some games. My friend and I both ordered a cup of clam chowder. It was really good. For food, I got the lobster salad sandwich with TATER TOTS. (Yay for tots!) My friend ordered the Philly cheesesteak sandwich with thin fries. The fries were regular sized, not 'thin'. Both sandwiches were good and  big in size. I took most of mine home with my friend's fries since we both ate my tater tots. 
The service was awesome. All the servers were cool. It was awesome I ran into a bunch of my friends here, all here for the same reason!"}
{"text":"My husband and I only come here for breakfast. It's inexpensive and the quality is pretty good. The ONLY issue is one of the waitresses, her attitude is awful! Not sure if she's just not a morning person or just not a people person. Not to mention she's super slow and forgetful even when no one else is in there.
We've tried to sit up at the bar when we go just to make sure we get helped by someone else. Other than her, everything else is pretty good!"}
{"text":"I love the food not only that, great service, and the bartender Sean dose a really great job, I do like that you have to buzz in after hours. Plus it is open 247."}
{"text":"Was here again during a Bear's game. I mentioned in my last review that I didn't care for their raw oysters--they didn't taste very fresh. Well, put those babies in a shooter with some vodka and bloody Mary mix and they are not bad at all. They are normally $5 but during Bear's games they're only $2."}
{"text":"The seafood here is very good, but the dish you really need to try is the black and blue salad. I'm not usually much for salad but this one blows me away. Romaine lettuce, grilled and sliced steak, blue cheese crumbles, onion straws and sun dried tomatoes make this one of the best salads I've ever had. Service is acceptable, food is very good."}
{"text":"Ehhh.  I checked out this place because several of my friends told me how great it was.  It was just okay.  Had the crab stuffed tallipia with wild rice and veggies.  A little greasy for my taste.  My husband had the pulled pork and waffle fries - he enjoyed his non-seafood better than I enjoyed mine.  The atmosphere was okay, the staff was friendly, prices were fair, but the food was not the best I've had."}
{"text":"I must say I was rather impressed. I talked this place up to a couple of co-workers and they were not disappointed at all. The breakfast specials are great on the wallet and good for the belly. Great eats at a great price. The service was top notch and the food was out in a flash. I got the chicken fried steak, complete with eggs, potatoes and just enough gravy. They've extended the time of their breakfast special, so you've got plenty of time to get there and enjoy. I will definitely return.  It's time for libations and oysters."}
{"text":"I first learned of Shuck's a couple of years ago after a friend told me about their fantastically inexpensive breakfast specials. Until now I had only visited the Flamingo/215 location and only for breakfast. When looking for place for the midday meal, the Mrs. and I opted for Shuck's. The only disappointment here is that I hadn't previously tried their lunch menu. They have a burger called the Mother Shucker that features a full pound of beef.  I opted for the smaller version or the \"Baby Mother.\" It came with fries (you can get garlic fries) and I added a side salad. The side salad was one the larger ones I've seen and featured red leaf lettuce, tomato and onion. Even the Baby Mother was huge and some kind of tasty. The waitress, Ashley, was very friendly and attentive, offering her advice on which fried fish the Mrs. should get. Good call on the Haddock Ashley. It was fresh and crisp, complete with garlic fries. I left stuffed like a Thanksgiving Turkey, with a smile on my face. Next time I'll attempt the Mother Shucker."}
{"text":"It's really dropped off here. I normally come in Thursday night for oysters. The last two times the food has made me sick. The little bartender has the worst customer service ever. The silver lining is the server Jose who always remembers what you like and is very attentive. They are barely even comping play now or maybe it's just this bartender. Unfortunately not sure I can come back after all this time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend keeps reminding me that you have to review a place for what it is.  Meaning, I can't review Shucks Tavern next to Sage restaurant.  

With that said, for a 24 hour gaming bar with an oyster bar attached this is top notch.  The seafood was all super fresh.  The boy ordered clam strips and a crab bucket.  Both were delicious and fresh.  I had the fish tacos, heavy on the cabbage, but I like cabbage.  It was a celebratory dinner so we had carrot cake and it was flavorful and moist.  The service was great and the drink specials were good for a Friday night (half price martinis?  Yes please!).  

We would definitely go back, especially since the boy often gets a craving for crab."}
{"text":"I'm updating this review because as of recent and since the general manager reached out I have received great service once again. 

Like I said my boyfriend and I come here a lot and I was super let down after an employee refused me the night's special because he was busy (there was one other person sitting at the bar) however, oscar, nick, anthony, and karina have always given good service and still continue to do so. 

It's refreshing to see them any time we come in. 
Thank you for reaching out!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently moved into the area and haven't had a chance to hit up the grocery store. She has been craving Clam Chowda ( east coasters :)  and i just happened to come across the menu for this place and saw they had it.  Wife yelled SOLD!  

Walking in , its the normal bar , tv screens tables and booths. 
It was a little grungy in there , but nothing i havent seen before. 

They have a decent amount of beers on tap , i ordered a New Castle , the wife had a Coors light ( EWWW ).

Ordered up a cup and bowl of clam chowda ! ,  it was very thick , had the right amount of clam to potato and veggie ratio and was very tasty.   

Out came the rest of the food.  My wife ordered the Boston Cod Sandwhich. Its basically a upscale McDonald fish fillet , but was outstanding.  Had alot of flavor and the fish , didn't taste fishy.  I ordered the Fish Fry .. and man was i in for a treat. I had a HUGE plate of fried haddock which was extremely flavorful and tender\moist.  I enjoyed it completely.   

They have alot of non fried light choices on the menu such as crab stuffed tilapia.  We will definitely be back to try these !. 

Try it , you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am a real oyster lover. Like, LOVE LOVE LOVE oysters. Ask my Yelp companion Tetsuro P. I can pack those suckers away. I can eat a bunch of them in one sitting. Often times, I have joked about how I should do a competitive eating contest. I think I could take the women's oyster trophy home. But that's a whole other review.

I have always called T.P. up and asked to join me for oysters. He usually says yes, so I guess that makes us \"oyster buddies.\" Mind you, I usually make this decision VERY late at night (or early in the morning, depending on how you view it). I think it's cool that even though he's not as big of an oyster fan as I am, he still comes along.

The main reason for this (besides the LOVELY company, lol) is the HAPPY HOUR here. It starts late at night (I think maybe 11 or midnight, not 100% sure), but it's worth it!! All the raw oysters are $1!!! Many appetizers are between $3 and $6!! I can eat my fill of oysters, and not go broke! It's heaven for me.

The bartender who is usually working late is a pretty cool guy, and both he and the older cook in the back now remember us. One time, the cook even came out to deliver my oysters! I guess he had  to see me for himself. He was probably expecting some huge, obese chick, based on how many I always order LOL!

I have never been here during the day, but they have a full menu and serve lots of other things besides oysters. So far, everything I have had here has been pretty decent."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. I went years ago and haven't been back since. It's gross food for the price you pay, it was dirty, and service was absolutely awful. I'm surprised the place hasn't closed down because it's been such a long time, and the experience sucks. Don't go here unless you went here when it was new and grew up on it, then I can't blame you. But definitely not a good spot in my books."}
{"text":"Really good place to enjoy some good eats that won't break the bank.  We got the Mother Shucker and it was freakin huge!!  The burger was a full pound stuffed with cheese,bacon, and mushroom.      Alps I on tap were the garlic ginger scallops that my wife said were tasty!  Our total bill for this feast was only $32.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great seafood Louie salad!  Happy hour 5 for $5 is solid.  Mussels portion was huge for$5. Service was attentive"}
{"text":"I ordered 1/2 lb of Crablegs with a bowl of clam chowder with calamari for an appetizer...and the food was awesome!  I should have came here a long time ago!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  Only thing I wish is that they wouldn't allow smoking, but that's every Vegas bar."}
{"text":"I am a local that works in the Vegas industry.  I come here after work to have oysters and great drinks with Larry (the best bartender).  He takes care of my friends and I all the time!  If you want great food and great service with awesome drinks, come see Larry!  Graveyard shift!  Oh ya baby!"}
{"text":"I stopped in around 11 pm on a Saturday for a bite to eat. I didn't realize that you had to be buzzed in. That's a bit creepy. Once inside I found the place dead with a cluster of waitresses and bartenders huddled off to the side joking around.

 I took a seat at the bar. After a few minutes the bartender tore herself away from her personal conversation to wait on me.  Even after that, the service was slow. The bartender seems miserable to there. She was equally as morose with the few other bar patrons. After going over the menu I asked her opinion on some choices I had narrowed down. Her menu knowledge left much to be desired. I settled on the oysters. They are terribly small and poorly shucked. 

The reason I have this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because it has potential but like many other Yelpers have stated, the service needs improved."}
{"text":"Alright, so I came here sometime around May of this year and it was alright. On my first visit, I had the rockafella oysters which I believe triggered my allergic reaction to shellfish. We sat at the bar and I had a lot of beer to drink... good times.

I ordered some chicken- type sandwich on my following visit which by the way was humongous and I was unable to finish it. Now this place is located in North Las Vegas so it's more of a hangout spot for the locals, there's nothing fancy or fantastic about it."}
{"text":"As a sports bar or a seafood joint, I'll admit Shucks is on the average side.

The only reason my family and I go here is for the breakfast deals (served until 1pm most days). You can truly high quality bar-food breakfasts here for $5. Pancakes, potatoes, chicken fried steak, benedicts...all really good. You will spend more on half the amount of food at any fast food chain.

I have older in-laws who wouldn't otherwise step foot in a bar, but love Shucks, and at the low price, you can take a bunch of folks out without breaking the bank and enjoy the Sunday morning NFL game while you munch away your hangover."}
{"text":"Hurry up and open Distill!!! I used to love the place. (see previous reviews) but they are starting to get weird with the regs. we used to play and play, be served drinks and served some more drinks, suddenly today we get Sh***y attitude from our ex fave bar tender and told we have to now pay for cognac. Meanwhile others at the bar yapping all afternoon served with no problem.  we play at least 100 + and are told we now have to pay $10.00 per shot? when did that crap start? oh it's been always. nope! we used to be comped food and drinks and now they are becoming Timbers. ok. well if I put $20 in the machine multiple times give me two shots a pop. they are starting to suck service wise and I'll lose my money elsewhere because the machines suck as well!"}
{"text":"took my mom to dinner, she wanted cab legs. have not been here in about 3 years.
I forgot how small the menu was, the portions were tiny, granted we ended up getting 2 appetizers; spinach & crab dip (no crab I could see or taste!) and stuffed shrimp (4) smallish shrimp stuffed with seasoned bread crumbs(and again not a hint of crab that I could discern). There also was a misunderstanding regarding a order of guacamole, for $ 2.95 I expected chips, not a side serving which was a good size. I was told by the waiter that people order it to add to their sandwiches, it was a lot of guac for that. the chips he brought were another $ 2.95 which I was surprised to see on the bill. I used to come here 4-5 times a year when I lived near by and was always satisfied but since moving back in the area, this was a huge disappointment. Small menu, small portions (except the guac!) bland taste very poor value. I hope this was just an off night for Shucks. (I did mention to the waiter about the guac and chips, I did tell him in the end not to worry but he was not very forth coming or apologetic a good waiter would gotten a manager or taken the chips off the bill, I deal with the public in the hotel industry and some thing of this nature would have been done regardless of my wishes)."}
{"text":"Decent food with a fair price, nice and roomy inside the tavern"}
{"text":"We love Shucks Tavern. The food is great, they are open late and it's never overly crowded. From salads and chicken fingers to big juicy burgers and lamb chops, Shucks never gets it wrong. Food and wait staff are fantastic. We highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Have been here many many times and we love this place as it open 24/7 great fresh and juicy food, great selection of liquors and pretty comfortable."}
{"text":"First off, the food is amazing and fresh.. Me being a seafood lover, almost everything on the menu is great!... But that's not even the half of it. I've come here a few times and always loved it; but tonight was THE WORST Customer Service I have ever had in my entire life. The Blonde female bartender was nice and personable. The male brunette older, grumpy heavy-set bartender, Sean, had no personality what-so-ever and came to check on us only to reply in an irritated tone. HE NEEDS TO BE FIRED ASAP! This is not a joke. He decided to scam our bill, as to hope we didn't notice, and charge us for extra drinks as we were already actively playing the machines. We decided to tell the gentleman the problem and he insisted he was right in his actions. Now me, being in the food and beverage industry, instantly noticed his lack of motivation and enthusiasm already, as he watched sports, but still gave him the benefit of the doubt... At first. As we argued about the bill he got very offensive and unprofessional yelling inside the restaurant trying to force us to leave. I will NEVER come back to this restaurant again because of the most terrible service I've ever had in my life. Do Not Come Here! SEAN IS THE RUDEST BARTENDER AND WILL GET IN YOUR FACE TO PROVE A POINT.... TO A CUSTOMER. Beware"}
{"text":"Made a return trip this weekend and wished I hadn't.  My complaint isn't for the food but the service.  Waitress took our order and disappeared.  Although she made stops at the table next to us, it  was like we didn't exist.   We flagged her down once and then luckily were able to get the attention of another server in the restaurant for drinks, etc.   It made for a very unpleasant dining experience especially since it was my suggestion. And I should add that in no way was this place busy at all."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. Had a clam bake, it was over cooked and not well seasoned. Soup was bad/too watery or salty. Calamari was over cooked. Oysters were ok, but that is hard to mess up. The server was nice, but the food needs some serious work."}
{"text":"I'm just not impressed with this place. The non smoking section smells like smoke and the oysters are sub par. I don't think we'll come again.  We've tried this place twice because it is so close. I'm not impressed with the cleanliness or the service for that matter.  I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Every month I get a ravenous craving for fish, especially oysters!!! My boyfriend and I were originally headed to the oyster bar inside palace station, but the wait was easily 2 hours... minimum! I certainly had no time for that, especially with my mood swings, so we decided to head to shucks.

Upon arrival, I was a bit concerned since the ambience was pretty dark and loud since there was a party of about 20 rowdy folks and about a few people at the bar. It's self seating so we sat by the bar since we'd probably get faster service and I was right. We had an awesome hostess that recommended specials and was prompt when we needed her. Here's what we ordered:    
   
2 dozen oysters
Fish n chips
Lobster roll
Bloody Mary
Blue moon

Oysters -were pretty fresh and had to stop myself before I ate all 24.
Fish and chips- beer battered cod was crispy, not oily, and perfect seasoning; the fries were on the flimsy side and skinny, but still nicely seasoned
Lobster roll- wasn't what I expected. I thought there'd be chunks of lobster, but instead looked like crab meat. The bun was nicely toasted and overall had a nice taste. My boyfriend doesn't like celery, and the roll had lots of it, but whether he was just too hungry or not, he still enjoyed the roll.
Bloody Mary- had the perfect amount of spice, and blue moon.. Well it's a blue moon.

Overall, I enjoyed the food and staff and will definitely return for the oysters and fish and chips. The prices are generous too, but will definitely return for those $1 oyster Thursday special!!!"}
{"text":"Came here since it was close to our house and pretty late...
Got our usual Lamb Lollipops with the Honey Basil Sauce, Clam Strips
and instead of Raw Oysters, I wanted to try Their Oysters Rockefeller....I should've read the description because they tasted like pizza with spinach and melted cheese on top, tasted okay, but I like my oysters with hollandaise instead of melted cheese. thats how I've eaten Oysters Rockefeller.....my bad for not reading the description thinking everyone else prepares it the same way.

we also got the fried cheesecake chimichanga and chocolate mousse cake which were okay. Next time I'll stick tothe raw oysters...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Guess I was wanting more. The service was great here, attentive, kind and he packaged our food that we couldn't finish with condiments and plastic utensils. Better than some fancy restaurants. 

The raw oysters were medium size but fresh. They came with all the right condiments, hot sauce, cocktail sauce, lemons and horseradish. 

The boiled crawfish were not good at all. They were way overcooked and looked old too. Maybe they were frozen but they were all shriveled up and the meat was a grayish color. I ate a few and decided not to test my stomach and eat anymore. 

The burger was good. Juicy and flavorful. The chicken tenders were pretty good as well. Love the fresh garlic that they used to season them."}
{"text":"Just wanted to start off and say the gaming at  this place is good got a four of a king And for the food it is awesome!!! seafood is hella  fresh and the bartenders are really nice  good place to kick it and watch the game or even go  to enjoy some great fresh seafood!!!"}
{"text":"If I could talk to John taffer from bar rescue I would tell him to go straight into this place. Let me tell you the service here ..... TERRIBLE. Sadly the owner is very cool and very nice took care of us once we couldn't stand this place but ..... He needs to fire EVERYONE. 
If you get the oysters and your have EVER eaten oysters you will immediately know these are NOT fresh and not even good enough to be edible. Gagging by the first bite we all moved to the clams. They were very good but very sandy. So a few crunches will not surprise you. Then we went on and received our main courses. I ordered the coconut shrimp and they arrived cold with fries even colder. My partner ordered the pasta which he said the chicken seemed rubbery and the pasta sauce was yet again, gagging. The burger my friend ordered looked like a joke. Deserts were great. Beer was good. And wine was watered down. I hate giving bad reviews but if this place isn't helped it should be reported to food services. I was blown away.


If you know food you will be disappointed beyond belief."}
{"text":"We had a great time watching Monday night football, food was great, I recommend the crab, it's awesome"}
{"text":"My friends and I have been going to Shucks for a very long time. I have been to all of them. I used to like going to the one on Serene and Eastern as well, but they are closed. We always look forward to late night specials and seafood 24hrs! 

Most of us work the nightshift at the Trauma Center. We are at Shuck's on all shifts. Days, swings, and nights. Most of the time we are there on graves. We know Larry, who my girlfriend, thought his name was Shuck...lol. We also know Mickey. We met most of the others as well  but Larry is the one we spend most of our time with. 

As with any establishment there are busy times, so we don't always get the attention we are accustomed to. We are there for the food and the friendly service is just a perk which we enjoy as well. Larry, Mickey and all the others, even the ones we don't really know have been pleasant. 

I'm a little disappointed to have read a previous review here on Yelp 02/12/2012. Somebody targeting one of the employees for their poor service. I find that hard to believe. My girlfriend and I were there just 2days ago. Sunday morning. We order our usual shrimp, hamburger and of course RICE for my Asian girlfriend lol. We had 2 drinks put some $$ in the machine, didn't win :( but as always pleased with our visit. Yes happy hour is happy hour, we often over tip but not always. The previous review not only attacked the service, but obviously attacked the quality of food being served. They are apparently unhappy and probably shouldn't go there. 

SHUCK's is awesome, has great 24hr seafood and we have always enjoyed the service as well!!!"}
{"text":"Was a little disappointed in my night at shucks... Went for crawfish since it's in season and was served frozen crawfish that was so over cooked it was rubbery and had no flavor... Barely any customer service with our server didn't even ask if everything was okay....."}
{"text":"I'd go back again, but it is just a place that is great to know that has something you're looking for if you crave it. I love that they're 24 hours and they also have a cheap breakfast special.

I tried their fish tacos that day since it was their special, and did the build your own for 22.95. My friend and I did the fried clams (which I recommend), the raw oysters which is four to this platter, the ceviche, and the cocktail shrimp. This platter is actually alot to eat, and good to share if you don't have a big appetite for seafood. Also, the tacos were good. The fish was tender and not dry. Flavorful, but predictable, and nothing unique as far as taste. The iceberg lettuce just makes it feel like any other fish taco."}
{"text":"Been a huge fan for years. Overall Shucks has always been a 4 star experience. Love the breakfast specials and my wife and I love the Seafood Louie. We have not been in for awhile but to cap off Mothers Day, we popped in for a couple of salads.

Something was different. In the past, the salad has included two pieces of lobster meat that came from the interior of the claw. In other words, it was really obvious the salad had lobster in it.

The menu description states:

\"Crab meat, shrimp and lobster served on a bed of mixed greens, tomatoes and a hard boiled egg. served with Louie dressing.\"

The crab meat is usually the glob of shredded meat in the middle of the salad. The two shrimp are on the side, along with the garlic bread, tomatoes and the sliced hard boiled egg.

No lobster to be seen unless the glob of finely shredded crab meat now has finely shredded lobster meet combined with it. And if that is the case because they changed the way the salad was made, they should probably change the menu description.

The worst part(and why you are getting three stars) was the defensiveness of the server speaking to me like I was an idiot and did not know what I was talking about.

We will still come back for the breakfasts but will never again be ordering a Seafood Louie salad."}
{"text":"I wouldn't know, sat ourselves with no one at the front door. Waited 20 minutes without anybody noticing our party of four at a 3/4 empty restaurant. I'll try again next time!"}
{"text":"Ok neighborhood-vibe restaurant. Food was typical of a greasy spoon. Or maybe I'm just from LA and have higher standards. The oysters were just ok. Even those felt somewhat...'greasy'."}
{"text":"I came here hoping to find great seafood near where I live. Unfortunately I didn't find it.  I started with some Oysters which were ok.  They weren't anything special and I wouldn't return.  I then had a combination platter to try several other dishes and was sorely disappointed.  The shrimp ceviche was bland and the only flavor that came out was the cilantro.  The calamari was overcooked so it was very chewy and the marinara it was served with was runny and odd tasting. The fried clam strips were over-battered and overcooked... the flavor itself wasn't bad but it was like chewing a tire.  The crab cakes didn't have any crab flavor, it was just an overpowering pepper flavor. All-in-all the service was fine and the people were nice so I have no complaints there.  Unfortunately most of the seafood is not fresh and I think this is the biggest reason why most of the food is bland and tough.  Granted its tougher to get fresh seafood in Vegas but the quality of the food is so low I won't be returning."}
{"text":"For a place called shucks, I'd expect an oyster that at the very least smelled better. I thought I was going to a seafood joint. As it happens I ended up at a sports bar that happened to serve sea food, and in a rather mediocre fashion at that."}
{"text":"I've been driving by this place for years, I keep telling myself that I should stop by one of these days. Well, that day finally came. The wife and I made an early dinner trip to check it out. Nice inside, spacious, a deceiving from the outside. Maybe because it's laid out kind of open like, with the bar on the right side, dinning area to the left, with some benches in the middle facing several large screen tv's. Good layout for sports watching. Food was good too. I have some smaller version of their huge burger. Good stuff, service was good. Not a place to hang out if you're under the age of, oh, 50...at least when we were there, more of an older crowd, maybe because we were so early. I'd go back, maybe later in the evening, see if any younger people show up, try some more of their menu and watch some games."}
{"text":"Not a long review. Ordered gumbo $13.95 . It was such a small portion a toddler could not have been filled by this portion . Setting that aside it tasted like it came from a can. Never going back and I would never recommend anyone eating there."}
{"text":"I literally walked in and out of this place. There was no one to help us be seated at the front to the point that we had to search for the host/waiter even though the place was dead.

Did I mention this place REEKS of cigarettes? Like, really bad?
I love seafood but I didn't feel like I'd be able to taste the quality of the food accurately here while inhaling clouds of smoke.
I lost my appetite immediately and left."}
{"text":"Bland, boring, and slow.  Oysters were okay but everything after that was fast food like, without the fast.  Not much lunch trade and still wasted an hour there."}
{"text":"well, the 1st time we went here, it was fabulous. so, we decided to go again & we ordered the same thing as before and what a disappointment, must've been a different cook the 2nd time. the coconut shrimp was under cooked & I had to send it back & when I did get my meal, it was greasy and they must've forgotten the coconut part...I ate 2 shrimp & took the rest to go. we might try this place again but it'll be a while before we do, if we do..."}
{"text":"The food was good loved the pancakes, next time trying seafood looks  yummy . Great service very. Friendly people ,I will be back"}
{"text":"Can't stop thinking about this place since I went two weeks ago. I know I was rather tipsy when I was there, but I do remember the food being great and the service being even better. Darvey (Sp?) was our amazing bartender!!!!! I woke up the next morning (afternoon) with my chicken wings by my side and they were still yummy. Thanks Darvey, Darby...you catch my drift..."}
{"text":"Service was attentive, ordered 6 oysters--fresh and clean; also ordered the clambake. Enjoyed both. Not many people  in the restaurant/bar, a couple of families. Didn't encounter any cigarette smoke. I'll return. Good value too."}
{"text":"The service was fabulous and the food was beyond delicious. With ample serving sizes. 
My flat iron steak and coconut shrimp was perfection. The steak was very tender and had terrific flavor.  The coconut shrimp was delicious, albeit almost burned----but didn't taste burned. Got out of oil just in the nick of time. 
All in all, for me and I think I speak for the rest of my party (3 others), Schucks was an exceptional dining experience. 
Thank you."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before and  it is always excellent.  Went in for a beer and a shot after work. The bartender was good, he described the specials that he had and served me quickly even though he had a full bar. Great customer service even to the two girls at the end of the bar that dident know what they wanted to drink (If you have ever worked behind a bar you know the type lol). This is a great place to grab food or just a quick drink."}
{"text":"This place is a awesome I am from so cal and have been looking for a local spot with great oysters at a good price. You can't beat Thursdays $1 raw $1.50 cooked or $2 shooters. Been here a couple times and the oysters have been consistently good. Victor has been our server every time and he is great. He's friendly and always makes sure our drinks are full and the oysters at flowing!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've liked Schucks food but the trip there tonight reminded me why I don't go there except to remind myself why I don't go there. 

The customer service is atrocious. I sat for over 5 minutes at the bar and not once did the brunette bartender acknowledge me in anyway. She got a couple of drinks, went into the kitchen, and then played with her phone cord on a strip outlet by the register. Never once looked up and said she'd be right with me or anything. This reminded me that this has happened to me before there. You basically have to be a regular to get anything resembling adequate service at Schucks. 

What is the dysfunction at this bar that they can't get employees to practice just adequate customer service?"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and as much as the seafood is good and a couple bartenders are great the machines are awful. I've never once won in my 3 years playing here. The best I have ever done is break even and the points from the player system are awful. If you stop playing for just around a minute it forgets your player card and doesn't count your points. You have to either keep playing which you rarely win or you have to keep reinserting your card every few minutes to try and take breaks and make your money last longer. The only reasons I continue to come here are because of Kara being the most amazing bartender in Vegas and because it's close but there's a pts, brewskies, and the Durango lodge within a couple blocks so I wonder why I bother if all I do is lose. They need to loosen up the slots just a little or I'm probably done gambling here. I've lost nearly a grand which to me is a lot and I not only don't have enough points to redeem anything but the points don't even go to food. I really shouldn't play here anymore. I usually don't mention anything when I start to dislike a place and change my hangout but I'm hoping the owner will see this and maybe change at least how tight the machines are.,I don't care about winning I just want to break even or be able to tip my bartender well without getting bent over the bar every time I gamble. I doubt anything will change though."}
{"text":"Went here 3 times now, and it has NEVER been good! This will definitely be the last time I try...
The freaking crab was hollow, wings were soggy and sandwiches were awful. They brought out three different clusters and none of them had more than one or two legs with meat in them...they said it was because of a bad order??? Whatever. On top of that, only one that was even hot...and it was the very LAST one, and by then I was over it! 
Gaming is also terrible. We both played hundreds at the bar EACH time and never saw anyone else hit anything either, which is so crazy. To sum it up? Mediocre food that they WILL comp when you lose at least 600.00, lol. No thanks!!!"}
{"text":"I normally go to Shucks for my Saturday breakfast. $3.95 any breakfast and $2.50 for soft drink... Ive made it my treat someone to breakfast place for the last 2 months... Last night my husband and I decided to go try their hamburgers and omgoodness, please know I am hard to please when it come to certain foods and burgers being one. This burger was just amazing, I was full after eating half the burger but it was sooooo good I almost ate all of it. Surprised they didn't have to call a tow truck to take my out to my car.... But seriously this is a wonderful place if your looking for a awesome burger or breakfast. Also Brit or Brad I think his name is, is a wonderful host... 2 shucks burgers with fries and 2 lemonades $24.00... And it was so worth it... They have Red Robin beat by a long shot"}
{"text":"Disappointed With the service. However Gus has saved this review from recieving 0 stars. 

Heres the story on how my Partner and I spent an Hour and a Half in this establishment feeling unacknowledged.
 
Our Waitress Sherri, was very unwelcoming and Unsociable. We sat ourselves as the sign in the entrance says too do so, She noticed us right away and still took 10 minutes to bring out our menu's. Keep in mind the Restaurant and bar was not busy. We were very hungry and Just wanted to order our food but it took an additional 15 minutes for her to come and take our order, where she made us feel as if we were wrong for ordering food.... She was very unfriendly and described the Food as okay... after she took the food order she stormed off where we didn't see her for a very long time and we wanted to order a few cocktails, Once our food was ready Gus brought it out and we finally were able to Order our Drinks since sherri never even asked for our drink order...  Gus was very Friendly and Prompt, And pretty much for the rest of our evening he took care of us and was extremely Hospitable. 5 stars for Gus!!!  Unfortunately Gus was not our server, it was not his responsibility to take care of our table, But he did, When we finally saw sherri Gus had already bussed our table and removed our plates and glasses, we asked her for the bill thinking she would bring it right out.... Here we are waiting without Drinks for our bill to come, Restaurant was not busy, Gus walks by and I inform him, \"hey whats up with our Waitress she hasnt took care of us at all tonight and now wont even bring out the check\", Very respectably Gus apologized and brought us out our bill right away. 

This experience took over an Hour for 2 plates of food, and 2 drinks.... Very not cool ;/"}
{"text":"I give this review with a full stomach of perfectly cooked steak and excellently prepared mussels! The service was exquisite with their wording, friendliness, and helpfulness. My mother has trouble deciding what she wants and the waiter was very helpful in helping her decide. The shrimp was perfectly fried and the mahi mahi was very light and fresh with scrumptious seasoning!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here all the time and know a lot of the staff. The food is always great and the waiters are always friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent service!! Very good prices on the raw oysters. Plus there is no line to wait in!! Love the seafood selection along with their specials."}
{"text":"Shrimp po boy had very few shrimp which was not tasty.  Fries not very good and the cole slaw was sour and not edible. 
Wife's fried oysters were terrible, bad tasting. Iced tea lousy.
We moved here from Dallas and Aw Shucks restaurants there were awesome!
Terrible waste of 30 plus dollars."}
{"text":"I've never been anywhere else where you can receive poor service, say something about it just to later be punished with an erroneous charge. To top it off, God forbid they make it right..... Instead, I was advised to dispute the charge with my bank. What a joke, it's a shame considering their food is really good."}
{"text":"It's like that meal you eat when you're really hungry and all of a sudden your full and grossed out.  The crab and spinach dip was runny and simply not good.  It came with toasted flour tortillas cut in triangles.  The crab cakes were salty and full of flavors that shouldn't go together.  The Rockefeller oysters and fried shrimp weren't bad.  Garlic fries were greasy and salty.  Ceviche was plain.  Snow crab and peel and eat shrimp was ok.  My advice is stick to the bar and have yourself a beer."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, but the service wasn't my favorite. We walked in and waited a good 10 minutes for someone to take our Order. WE even had to ask for a waiter. No one payed any attention to us throughout our time there. I hope next time the service is better to enjoy with the food."}
{"text":"Just moved nearby. 

As good as other top-notch Nevada-style pubs Steiners and Village Pub.

Specializing in seafood.

Had peel and eat shrimp- very fresh, and a Shrimp Buffalo Ranch Wrap- very good, not too spicy-not too bland.

Good service.

I will be back soon."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. . . and everything I had tasted awesome! A solid four stars if my boyfriend hadn't gotten food poisoning from this place. $60 meal turned into a $600 hospital visit. . . enough said."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. We eat here all the time and have never had a bad experience. Some of the best and freshest seafood in town."}
{"text":"So good and so simple.  I love their oysters.  The mothershucker burger is huge and always cooked medium rare when I order it this way and the jambalaya has just enough kick to it that keeps me coming back.

Shucks is faithful to me in the sense that they're open 24 hours and not that run down of a place. 

I think I've posted a years worth of pictures before writing this review but whenever I'm in the north west area of Las Vegas I know for sure Shucks is always a good option for me to fall back on.

Let me wrap this up by saying the Salmon entree is excellent, the pork chop appetizer is always good, and the black cod/catfish dishes are gravy too.  

Do not hesitate ever to walk in!"}
{"text":"My favorite is still the jambalaya but the only time I ever eat at Shucks is night or late night and the atmosphere is just not there for me at this location.  My favorite dishes have always been the jambalaya, lamb chops, big mother shucker, oysters!, and crab legs.  

The food is still good and the oysters are still one of the best in Las Vegas but it's just awkward sitting at the bar when drunk and stinky people are around you, a bartender isn't quite friendly and not even around as often, but I'll still come back.  Late night eats here is okay but it's one of the few that are open so I have to deal with it."}
{"text":"I have been 3 times over the last year or two. The first time my family met some friends for dinner. We ordered and one persons meal was completely wrong, and my husband giant burger was RAW on the inside. I mean not cooked at all!! Second time service was awful but the soup was good. Tonight and the last time I will attempt this place. My son ordered some chicken wings with onion rings and I stuck with the soup. We got fries instead, I told the runner we had ordered onion rings and he said he would bring them out. Our server, name never told to us, came out and said we didn't order onion rings. I told him I did while my son sat shaking his head yes. He then told me well I didn't hear you but he is going to bring some out. Ok, not that big of a deal, a little rude but whatever. As my son proceeds to eat his wings he realizes there is dark grimy something in his chicken. Idk what it is and it's in the last 5-6 of his wings. When the waiter comes back he asks if we want a box, absolutely not! One of the wings had what my son said looked like bloody eggs in it. The server looks at the food and says so it wasn't good? Really no! He leaves with the plate, so then I have to hunt down a runner to get my bill. I also ask for a manager. After waiting for a long time with no manager in sight I paid my bill and left. We will never return. Service was horrible, food was horrible. 3 strikes you're out!"}
{"text":"Oyster was bad !! Not fresh and not cold enough!!  Can not spend my money here !!! I know the happy hour is busy here but food is disappointed"}
{"text":"It was a Sunday afternoon with hubby and the in laws. We all were super hungry and felt like seafood. After searching for seafood restaurants on Yelp, I came across Shucks Tavern & Oyster Bar. I printed out a coupon ($10 off of a bill $50 or more) and we hit the road. 

At first, we were all very skeptical and the restaurant's building wouldn't reveal anything about what was expecting us inside. Finally we got over our fears and entered the restaurant. The atmosphere was very friendly, even though a little smoky, since the bar wasn't separated from the dinning area. 

For the first hour we were the only customers in the entire restaurant, which didn't bother us at all. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. We asked him about his favorite on the menu and he suggested the Clam Bakes for $26.95, which feeds up to 2 people and includes the following: 
   
    Manila Clams (1 lb)
    Snow Crab (1 lb)
    Dungeness Crab (1/2 lb)
    Andouille Sausage
    Red Potatoes
    Corn

We ordered 2 of it and WOW, it looked and tasted amazing. The clams were very fresh and tasteful, and so were the snow crabs and the rest of the goodies in that shell looking bowl. 

As we asked for the desert menu the waiter came back after about 10 minutes with a tray of different cakes and ice cream samples. We all thought that was very cute and the effort was what counted. We decided for a piece of chocolate cake and the fried cheesecake burritos. They both were very delicious. 

I would definitely go back to Shucks. The food was fresh and tasty and price value relationship was great."}
{"text":"Who says the food deals are dead in Vegas? Shucks' entire breakfast menu is $3.95 and you really can't do better than that.  I had Shucks Breakfast:  2 eggs, choice of ham, bacon, sausage, brunch potatoes and toast. My dining partner had the Chicken-fried steak breakfast.  I had a bite and it was really good.

As other reviews have mentioned, coffee is $2.50 which nearly doubles the cost of breakfast, but it's still cheaper than Denny's!  Highly recommend this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"I like this place it's close to my house and pretty low key, pretty good selection of beer and food."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating at Shucks for several years now. The food has always been great, but the service is so hit or miss. Lately more miss than hit. 

The kitchen is small and the wait staff is only marginal. It's fine as long as it's not busy. But if you go on a Friday night, expect to wait forever. Tonight, I had to ask for a waiter to take out order because we sat for almost 15 minutes without being greeted by our waiter. Then the table next to us, who was sat after us and waited on after us for their appetizers and entrees before we were served anything. I had to ask for a manager. 

Like I said, the food never disappoints. But I'm not sure we will be eating here anymore with the lack in service."}
{"text":"We usefully come for dinner but instead we came fire breakfast.  Good breakfast menu. They have several items just for  $5."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 5 stars for one reason; I love Florida style fried shrimp and this is the only place in Vegas I've found that has it like I like it. I would come just for the shrimp."}
{"text":"Awesome seafood in the middle of the desert!  Crab legs are on point, shrimp is amazing, lobster mac n cheese....yum.  I found this place late night after a night of partying.  The bar food is delicious too.  Service is solid but not wow worthy.  So that's a half star deduction.  And another half star deduction for being a Bears bar :). Go Broncos!"}
{"text":"I was watching a re-run of Bizzare Foods recenlty and saw Andrew Zimmern diggnig up clams in Rhode Island.  Suddenly I found myself with a strong craving for fried clam strips.  I used to share a basket with my mom at our favorite sea food place when I was a kid.  I had to have them again.  It had been too long.  After much searching a failed attempt at a restaurant that no longer exists, I found myself at Shucks Tavern.  

It was about 9:30 AM when I was in the area and I knew Shucks to be open 24/7.  So in I walked and was immediately handed a menu for breakafast items.  I gave the guy a funny look and asked if they were serving only breakfast or if I could order from the regular menu.  He said I could order anything and must have been confused by my request.  I mean who wouldn't be.  I'm sure most people don't tend to order fried clams at 9:30 in the morning.  But I've never been one for breakfast foods and I had a craving.  So I ordered my fried clams, a side salad with Italian dressing and an ice tea.  

What seemed like many minutes went by and were fewer than it seemed.  Soon I had my salad and a nice plate of fried clams.  They were impressive too.  Dark golden brown.  Big and meaty.  There was a large cup of cocktail sauce and a couple of lemon wedges on the side.  The salad was perfect for a side.  Mixed greens, tomato, onion.  The perfect amount of dressing.  The vinegar woke up my taste buds and got me ready for the good stuff, the clams.  And they were good.  Tender but still chewy to let me know they were the real deal.  None of this chopped formed garbage.  Perfectly fried and crispy.  The cocktail sauce was amazing.  There was enough horse radish to make me sweat.  A little extra lemon juice mixed in and it was perfect.  I ate down those crispy little bi-valves and felt this sense of euphoria wash over me.  My craving had been satisfied and I was ready to begin the rest of my day.  Everybody else can keep their Wheaties.  For me, fried clams first thing in the morning is the true breakfast of champions."}
{"text":"If you're in The Centennial Hills areaand you are looking for a great seafood restaurant with incredible burgers, soups, nachos or you want to stop in for an endless lunch for $8.95 this place is a must!

The restaurant itself is very large and very comfortable booths, tables and the bar stools are super cushy"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. It was great. The service was awesome!!! Had crab and spinach artichoke dip as appetizer....yummmy. The seafood bisque in sourdough bowl was great too. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"WOW! My new favorite place in the neighborhood. A little noisy during football games Sunday and Monday night but if you are a non-drinker this can also be very entertaining people watching. Now for the food, I have eaten there several times and there are no complaints the crab legs are fresh and cooked to perfection as is the fish, the cod is crispy and flakey the mahi mahi is as good as I have ever eaten on any fresh fish market. The service is friendly and they work their ¥%£%# off so we make sure they are rewarded well for the excellent service. I can't say enough about this local gem."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for a few years and have always been extremely happy with the food and the service. They have a nice bar area and then booths and tables. I usually always grab a booth because when I come here I'm so hungry I want to order a few things and it all doesn't fit comfortably on the bar. 
We have had the exact same server for over a year now and he's great. Brings us our waters and beers quickly and keep them refilled. All the staff is pretty awesome and friendly and makes sure to never forget you. 

My foodie date and I were starving so we started off with the crab and spinach dip. I personally do not like the pita chips it comes with so I had them switch it to tortilla chips instead. Always a favorite. Then we also ordered  the calamari this time. This was the first time ordering that appetizer here and I have to say that was some of the best calamari I have eaten anywhere in Vegas. It was so light and crispy that I savagely ate the entire plate by myself. If you come here definitely order that. 

Now on to the entrees! I think I have tried almost everything on their menu now but the Steak and Crab is by far my favorite. It's a flat iron steak( seasoned perfected) which is delicious and 1/2 pound of crab. The steak is always so tender you can cut it with a fork and my crab was exceptional. Huge pieces of meat that didn't even need any lemon or butter because it tasted so good on its own. They were out of my favorite sautéed summer squash side so I got broccoli instead. My date had the new Clam Bake( I think that's what it's called..?) which was amazing! It had a generous amount of clams, andouille sausage, corn, snow crab, and these deliciously seasoned potatoes. Not only did I eat all my food but I ate part of my dates as well. Haha it was just extra good. 

Even after all that food I had to have some desert. Their cheesecake and brownie is to die for but I decided on the fried cheesecake and let me tell you I wasn't disappointed! 

2 appetizer, 2 entrees, dessert and soda/beers our totally bill came to $85 which I thought was very reasonably for seafood and steak. Great place and if you are a sports fan they always have the games playing as well."}
{"text":"There bus boy although he resembled Ellen Degeneres was very helpful and polite. Food was amazing and service from them employees was phenomenal. Trevor well done son."}
{"text":"I like this place ~ it's a local place, it's comfortable, service and food are wonderful, what more could you want?! 

Let's start by saying, I don't do oysters . . . shrimp yes, crab legs, yes, but not oysters, so I can't review those. 

My all time favorite and what I always come back to is the blackened tuna tacos!!  Wow, yes please!!  And the shrimp tacos are also amaaaaazingly delicious!!  Blackened mahi is also very tasty, but tuna is my favorite!!  My husband always gets the fried shrimp and always raves about it, so I'm guessing they're pretty awesome too.  He orders fried shrimp everywhere we go so he's quite the expert by now. He says this place does it right!!

We've been here quite a few times and have never been disappointed, of course we'll be back!  The people are always friendly and that's a plus!  Try it out ~ great neighborhood eatery!!"}
{"text":"Half of my son's hockey team (plus parents) went here for lunch yesterday. Extremely good experience. The server was organized and kept all the kids' orders straight with each parent. The food came pretty fast, considering how many of us there were. And the food was pretty good too!  No downsides.  :-)"}
{"text":"Excellent Food and Outstanding Service!

I recently visited Las Vegas and was recommended by a friend to try this place out for their great 24 hour menu.  Late on a Saturday night, this seemed like a good option.

WOW!  The food at Shucks is amazing.  I went in with the intention of just having a dozen oysters, but the late night bartender recommended a couple of other dishes as well.  I decided on the garlic shrimp--in addition to the oysters.  Both dishes were amazing. The shrimp were fairly large and the garlic sauce was outstanding.  The oysters were fresh and very tasty!  

The bartender working that night was on top of everything.  Helping out others in addition to recommending great dishes.  He really made me feel welcome!

All I can say is that this will be a \"must-stop\" everytime I head out to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Well, to start, apparently on Tuesday nights they have a \"paintnite\" where they take up one side of the restaurant where all the booths and real tables are. They use a microphone to give painting directions that is way too loud!
The food we ordered, steamed clams, 2 half pound orders, one garlic and one Cajun, came out in the same bowl and had a bad taste, like mildew water.
The tacos were good. They were on sale, $3 each. 
We also had the New England Clam Chowder in a sourdough bread bowl, that was bland but good. Also a lobster roll sandwich, was good but still had to much mayo after we ordered it with very little mayo. 
The blackened cat fish was moist and tender but not blackened enough. 
I must say I don't write reviews all the time, but I felt I needed to warn the public."}
{"text":"Awesome seafood! Standard gaming bar, couple great bartenders but what really sets it aside is the great food and reasonable price. Best clams I have had, in Las Vegas that is. Great oysters and the crab legs are solid, not nearly as expensive as you might think either. This one is definitely worth a shot if you are tired of the same old Las Vegas style bar food that is on every corner."}
{"text":"We are so incredibly picky with seafood, my GF is from Maryland and only used I the best... This place is the ONLY place we truly love for seafood! We have been here several times and NEVER disappointed!!! The oyster Rockefeller, DIVINE! The peel and eat shrimp was perfect and the coconut shrimp was beyond amazing!!! Try this place for some legit seafood!!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Shuck's Thursday's specials for Oysters. $1 dollah oysters! They also have this special on Sunday and Monday for the NFL games. I came here on Thursday and it wasn't busy...just a steady stream of customers.  We decided to come here for the oysters since it is oyster season...supposedly any month ending in \"er\" is oyster season.  
We started off with 15 oysters and I decided on the Pear Martini. The Pear Martini was just ok, it just tasted like regular vodka with sprite. I decided to go with the shrimp tacos and a cup of the clam chowdah of course. The bf decided on a burger. Our oysters came out first....and it was love at first sight. They were so fresh and delicious...definitely in season! It left me wanting more....but I think 15 oysters is quite a bit for the two of us. The food came out shortly after we got our oysters...so between eating oysters and some soup (not at the same time), I felt like I was in heaven. However, I finally got to my shrimp tacos....I was so dissappointed. The shrimp was over cooked and just didn't taste like shrimp....and there was so much cabbage and dressing that it soaked through the tortillas.  The shrimp tacos were slightly redeemed by the french fries....those were crispy and tasty! I believe the bf loved his burger....but I'm sure that's not too hard to mess up.  
5 stars for the oysters, 4 stars for the service and 2.5 stars for my shrimp tacos. Lesson learned...no shrimp tacos from Shucks but plently of oysters! I will be back to get more oysters on Thursday!"}
{"text":"this place is cool. i've only been here once and enjoyed it very much. we ordered the Shuck's Clam Bake for two and got, clams, snow crab, dungeness crab, king crab, corn and red potatoes- all for under 25 bucks. i thought that was a great deal. the seafood was tasty and seemingly fresh. i left full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Shucks has a couple appetizing items on the menu, but for the most part the food is overpriced and far from authentic.

The service can be a crap-shoot in terms of speed and getting correct orders.  But I have nothing bad to say about the atmosphere of the place.

Not saying I wont be back, but its low on the list"}
{"text":"Bartenders are great, good food and good prices. All around just a solid place to go too especially for seafood or a burger."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks, my favorite local bar. The food is a lot better quality than most bars in town. Best fish n Chips I've had anywhere and they have very cold Lagunitas IPA on tap which is great. Prices are very reasonable too and they have no problem comping drinks if you're playing a little."}
{"text":"I used to love Shucks, and it was my go-to neighborhood bar. Back in the day, they had fantastic 2lb crab buckets for under $30. When people would ask me my favorite thing about Las Vegas, those affordable crab buckets would be part of my reply- mostly because you can order them 24 hrs a day. Crab at 3am? Why not?

Those  days are long gone now. The menu has changed, the late night specials have changed, the bar staff has changed. They used to offer a great late night menu after midnight (pics posted) but no more, now it's just breakfast. There's two bartenders who work there late night, one is a darling, the other who is newer is so rude.

The crab is now $9 for 1/2 a pound, which is  just kind of silly. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's only so-so. The tuna is previously frozen, which is what you would expect from a place like this and sometimes it's okay, sometimes it's inedible. The oysters seem to be popular but they're gulf oysters which really isn't my thing.

I used to love this place and would come at least a couple of times a week, but no longer. I'll still drop in once in a while if the bartender I like is working. And it's still a great place to get seafood late at night, but for your bar needs? You can do better."}
{"text":"My husband's co-worker raved about Shucks constantly, so we finally decided we'd give it a try last night.

What a horrible dining experience.  Granted, I wasn't expecting it to be a 5 star experience - but if I could leave a \"NO star\" rating, I would.

Being a Friday night, we anticipated that service may not be great...but it was awful.  Our waitress was clearly overwhelmed by handling the bar area and tables, so perhaps that's why she made us to feel like we were intruding, rather than attempting to muster a smile or be polite.  Not the way to ensure a decent tip.  Though we left the customary 15%, had she put just a small bit of effort in to being friendly, we would have tipped her higher regardless of the poor food.  I never knock the wait staff for poor food.

We started with the crab & spinach appetizer special.  One bite of a mixture of the crab and dip and we immediately knew the crab had passed its servable life expectancy, and the seasoned chip things were stale - not off to a good start.

Needless to say, we weren't taking another bite of that.  We'd also ordered calamari, and neither my husband or older son complained about that (I don't eat it so I have to assume it was OK...they both lived through the night).

Our youngest ordered the sliders from their children's menu, our older son the pulled pork, and my husband and I steamed snow crab.

What my husband and I got were cold steamed crab legs and half melted butter.  And who serves a pound of crab legs without the claw?  It was too late to bother going anywhere else by this time, so we just ate the cold crab.

The pulled pork was fine, but it wasn't until our youngest seemed to focus more on the french fries after only eating 3/4 of one slider did my husband realize the damn things were RAW through the center...not rare...RAW.  How is it possible to NOT cook 2 slider size burgers thoroughly?  Note that our waitress didn't ask how we'd like the burgers cooked - so I could understand had the sliders been done rare (which would have been acceptable) - but RAW????

A complete waste of our time & money - I'd rather go to a Red Lobster chain than ever eat at another Shucks."}
{"text":"GREAT food, GREAT service, (thank you Ashley), we will be back! Haddock almost as good as what we get on the East Coast. Killer drinks!!"}
{"text":"Shuuuuuuuucks!!! What happened? We came back for the seafood pan roast and it was good but not as great as I last remembered - 3 stars. 

Maybe because it was actually crowded and had a long wait to get the menu, the servers, and it was a Saturday night.

Jambalaya - was 2 stars. it did not look like one and didn't have any jambalaya spices. 

Oysters- mehhhhhhh they are a bit below average. 2 stars. 


Fried calamari - 2 stars. Didn't like the breading at all. Imagine Popeyes chicken breeding on the calamari and not the super light fluffy batter.

garlic bread- 4 stars. Love it here with the cheese on top.

Bacon wrapped shrimp- 2 stars. Good enough but nothing to write home about. My friend has a way better recipe than how it's done here so I'll skip it in the future. 

I'm a bit bummed out that it wasn't as good as I remembered. Seafood pan roast is still good enough to eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for years. The food is consistently great! Everything we have tried is just as good as the next. A big high-five to the staff all the way from the manager down are awesome. Check out the daily deals."}
{"text":"Burger was good. But bartender charged us for sodas... really sodas at a bar???!! Even with machine play???"}
{"text":"I've only been here once and hope to bump up my rating as I plan on coming back. Shucks is very appealing to me because its pretty close to my house, making it super convenient, AND they have a good mix of seafood as well as meat - very important factor for me because my sweetie hates seafood and I love it. Typically places that advertise seafood have either none or very few meat options. Shucks seems to have everything. Should be a match made in heaven, right? I thought so too but it did not go down that way.
Fist, they had $3 margaritas on Tuesday - yes please! Margaritas were pretty good, deliciously potent. I decided to try their crab and spinach dip appetizer and went with jambalaya as an entree. The the dip had something sprinkled on top, which I assume was crab.. there were no other signs of crab, it was basically a spinach dip. The cajun jambalaya was supposed to have cod, crawfish, and andouille sausage - it had one piece of overcooked cod, probably 3 x1 inches with tons of sausage and some crawfish. The clod looked like was a side order. I was super confused why it came in one piece on the side and why that was all the cod that was in there... The biggest problem I had with the jambalaya is that it was SUPER salty. I am a salt loving gal but this thing was all salt. I couldn't really eat it. 
My honey, however, enjoyed his wings and fries. He is a wing snob and is very particular about his wings. He only gets wings from two spots in Vegas. Well, he like the wings here! He got them medium. His french fries was delicious too, I can attest to that :)
Though I did not care for my food, I plan to come back and try other things off the menu to find what I like. I really have high hopes for Shucks!"}
{"text":"This is Chicago Bears bar. I am not a Bears fan, but I play one on TV. They have great game day specials, and as long as you don't causer trouble by be ing over zealous for another team, they are quite nice, as I have found Chicagoans in general. So stop in, behave yourself and enjoy the great Bloody Marry's and Chicago Dogs, cheap on game day! Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Been craving Oysters for awhile found this place and was super excited but left super disappointed. Ordered a dozen oysters which ended up costing $20 and they were SO small we couldn't even taste them it really ruined my meal. Biggest waste of money. Also ordered a chicken BLT wrap, it was good but really messy and fell apart so it was hard to eat. Other than that, service was great but doubt that I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Best fried clams I've had outside New England. Lightly breaded, full sized, and great clam flavor. Nice tasting homemade tartar sauce. The lobster roll was okay, but too over-processed. Lobster meat shredded (a huge no-go if you've had a REAL New England lobster roll) and way too much celery. Green onions and seasoning in the mix take away from the lobster flavor. They should keep it simple and let the lobster be lobster. It's hard to beat a real Maine lobster roll though."}
{"text":"Aww shucks... I was SO excited for your Thursday deal of $1 raw oysters, $1.50 cooked oysters, and $2 oyster shooters.  But as our party sat down, our server informed us that the special for tonight is $1.50 raw oysters and $2 oyster shooters (no more cooked oyster special.)  We thought, \"hey, 50 cents extra isn't too bad. Let's dooo it.\"  And off we went to oyster happy land.  

Thinking it was a great deal, each of us ordered a dozen oysters each.  As a part of their Thursday oyster special at $1.50 a pop, it comes down to $18 which is dun dun dun... the SAME price as the menu!!  What kind of deal is that?!  My friend and I put our order on the same tab to include 24 oysters, which would've been a better deal on the menu at $32 than at the $36 special we were charged.  

Don't get me wrong, the food was good!  Oysters were fresh, meaty, and sweet.  They provided ample amounts of lemon, horseradish, tobasco, and cocktail sauce.  We ordered some oyster shooters and man, those cups were a lot bigger than we imagined!  (We thought it would be like the tiny Japanese oyster shooters you get at the sushi restaurants, ha ha.)  At $16.95, the linguini and clams were alright.  The noodles were bland and lacked sauce.  The garlic parm fries ($2.95) was a good deal, pretty big sized basket that can be shared with a group.  It has a nice hint of garlic that wasn't overwhelming.  I found myself reaching for the fries more than my linguini.  My friend got 10 wings ($14.99) in soul sauce and he said it was alright.  We also ordered 2 pitchers of beer and I couldn't help but notice that my cup smelled like an old rag.  I didn't complain because, hey, I'm eating at a bar.  But it was just something I noticed. 

The service was pretty good. For a table of 12, we got our orders pretty quickly and they were able to split our bill without a problem.  The food is pretty good despite it being at the bar.  But because I'm eating at a bar, I expected food to be on the cheaper side and not in the $15+ range.  The not-so-special oyster special realllly killed my expectations."}
{"text":"Shucks has a hole in the wall vibe but has great food and a fun atmosphere. They have extremely reasonable pricing on fresh sea food and cheap drinks. They always have specials on oysters. Other than their oysters, their seared tuna and ceviche are my go-tos. Always friendly staff as well!"}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service. This is the third time I've gone in and have received poor service. It takes forever for the bartender/waitress to come over or even address you.Then once they finally do, they take your order, give you one drink and you basically have to hunt them down where you're ready to order a second drink, so plan to finish your food before someone even comes over to offer you another drink. It's unfortunate that the service is so poor because otherwise I would have given them 5 stars. Obviously if I come in to a restaurant/bar I'm looking to eat and drink, not just stare at the tv's empty handed. I will say the one time I came in and sat on the restaurant side, the waiter was super attentive and the experience was pleasant but that bar side ruins it for me."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, a pretty good seafood restaurant.  Lots of regular bar food, but also a lot of shellfish and seafood on the menu.  Staff was decent, friendly.

The menu is kid-friendly but the bar is not really separated from the eating area (it's all open, not separate rooms) so depending on how busy the bar is, it might be a little smoky for little ones.  

No military discount, but if you need seafood and don't want to brave a casino or downtown, then Shucks is a great alternative."}
{"text":"Really enjoy coming down to Shucks to chill, have a drink, and eat seafood.  It's really casual and a great place to have a late night bite.  The seafood is fresh and the drinks are strong.  The wait staff is always really friendly and this has become a regular hang out for us.  They have daily specials and is a great place to watch football."}
{"text":"After seeing all the reviews on this place and its late night specials I couldn't wait to try this place being that I love oysters and a great happy hour spot. OK so we went here late Saturday night around 1am! Walking in the bar came across as a Pretty friendly bar. It seemed as though everyone knew everyone. The bar staff was friendly, nice and attentive! He took our drink order and dropped off the late night menu... the menu everyone had been ranting and raving about, the menu That brought us to this bar only to find out.. the menu changed!! Yes changed! NO burger and fries deal, no calamari special the only the thing that was the same was the $1 oysters! When we asked the bartender what's up w the the menu he Told us it had changed.. So I ordered the Rockefeller oysters, fried oysters and a couple raw ones as well and they were delicious.  The cook brought them out which nice. Overall the place was nice and the food was good but I wouldn't go out of my way to drive that far for it.."}
{"text":"I just love this place! This time tried the sea tacos with grilled cod... SO GOOD. My son had their shucks burger and it was also great. Fries have been on point every time... And their cheesecake.. Damn good. Everyone was so nice. We had Nicolette as our main server and she was great :) I know I should try new places, but I really do enjoy shucks too much to branch out right now!"}
{"text":"I'm happy that Shucks offers Seafood Pan Roast! I usually go to Palace Station for it but there is usually a long line. Plus I feel pressure to finish because it is confined to a small bar area where people are lined up behind you. 

I chose to have the shrimp, scallop, and crab meat with mine. The seafood is mixed in a hot creamy tomato broth which I had over white rice. It so good especially on a cold day! I also had the shrimp ceviche which was also delicious. If you don't have anybody  to share the appetizer with like in my case I would suggest just getting the entree because it is filling enough. My husband doesn't eat seafood so I was stuffed eating both. 

We shared a apple tart with vanilla ice cream for dessert which was perfect! I think Shucks is a great place to go for seafood if you want to eat in a casual atmosphere. Plus it is opened 24 hours so whenever the craving strikes you can go!"}
{"text":"Interesting place with the tin shack look. Decent food that not too expensive mainly emphasizing the seafood options available like crab & crawfish boils. I had the fish and chips and they were OK but not quite sure if they were fresh or frozen. Some friends had burgers and they looked good."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and this place to me is just okay. Oysters aren't very fresh and the food is okay. Place could be a little cleaner too. Service was okay as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy bogo sandwiches and wraps Wednesday evenings. The food is always superb! I would give this review 5 stars if it was just based on food. The crab legs are fresh, sweet and juicy. Love the fries and buffalo chicken wrap. However the service here is horrible, if you're unfortunate enough to get one of the girl waitresses. Takes 10 min to even be greeted luckily by then you have already decided what to eat. The food is out pretty fast because the cook usually brings it. Then it takes 30 min to be able to pay and leave.. Anyway if you have extra time to wait and don't mind dinner taking two hours they have good food."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! Took 45 min to order, you need more employees? Hit me up, I'm free."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a great place!!!!  For us, it's our Cheers!!!!  We walk in and everybody knows our name, drinks, meals!!!!  A little crowded during Paint Night but we work around it.  They have great music, a good following of regular customers, the best salmon Caesar salad ever!  Not to mention bar tenders!!!  Thanks Carina!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to enjoy a lovely breakfast here this morning. Honestly I wasn't expecting much but it ended up being a really great meal the potatoes were nicely seasoned eggs and bacon cooked perfect. The pancakes came out nice and fluffy but I didn't like that they only had the heinz syrup in the packets yuck. But the decor was nice and warming even though it was a Bears based theme being a packers fan that was kinda rough lol all that aside I like this little place very cozy and welcoming. Lastly I would like to say the service could use a little help I'm sure that because it was early not all the servers were there and maybe they were stretched thin but 30 min to get our card processed was just too much and it's not like the place was packed full also I would not recommend a bloody Mary here very thick and concentrated was not a highlight of the meal at all."}
{"text":"Being from Seattle I know seafood! And if you have ever cooked lobster you know it turns WHITE! And this place serves translucent lobster! When getting a reply from the server he said that's how it is.....So gross, hoping my man and I don't end up sick!!"}
{"text":"They lose a star because the service is just OK....but for bar food I have ate at both the centennial and the flamingo location (for paint nite) and both are great, but I do think the portions at the centennial location are larger. I always get the scallops with ginger glaze and it is a HUGE portion and always very tasty. The garlic fries are AMAZING!! Family friendly also! I definitely choose Shucks over a PT's or Timbers for a good, reasonably priced meal."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow to get someone to take our order. My wife ordered the clam chowder, and said for a seafood place wasn't the greatest. I ordered the fish and chips were kinda small. And honestly it wasn't the greatest, the batter was so so. I was hoping for something more. My girl ordered the combination platter and not all the shrimp were battered, the bottoms were not battered at all. They needed to sit for a sec since all the batter came off. It took 6-7 minutes to get a beer. Ordered 2 kids quesadillas and that took almost 20 minutes. I didn't thank they were that busy, but ok. Sorry to say just not that impressed."}
{"text":"Good music and bar food. Service can be spotty at times. Still the selection of drinks and food make it worth coming back."}
{"text":"I just ordered to go and I am really dissatisfied with my order. I got the pan roasted seafood for $20 and it's so not worth it. It tastes good but I guess they want you to buy 3 orders per person."}
{"text":"The service was great. The lobster was like rubber, wasn't prepared right. Wasn't pleased with any of the dishes we had received."}
{"text":"AMAZING $3.95 BREAKFAST.

I am really not a fan of their lunch and dinner.  One time I got the king crab lebs and I had to send them back they were so nasty.  But breakfast is where this place really shines.   Monday - Friday 12am-11am.  Weekends 12am-1pm.  Huge portions and a slightly limited but good selection of entrees.  The omelettes, and chicken fried steak are a great and tasty value. I don't think anywhere can beat this breakfast, even the casinos.  Check it out and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes before a server acknowledged us. Foods ok but not good enough to make up for the crappy service..."}
{"text":"I'll get straight to the point.

Thursday Special $1.50 Oysters - they were not the worst oysters I have ever had, but they were not exactly plump and sweet. They were what you would expect from a bar.

Mussels- the absolute worst mussels I have ever been served. The mussels were so small they were not even worth eating. The shells were broken into small pieces. I was shocked that they served them to me.

Crab Cakes - definitely not lump crab and they were cold.

My expectations were not high to begin with, but com' on man. You can't serve people that kind of mess. That was a waste of $67.00. I was better off on my first trip when they were closed. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place has the best nachos in town! Steak or chicken. You also can't beat the cheap huge breakfast. Not only is it cheap food. It tastes like only something a king would eat. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Good service...horrible food.  I really don't know why it's almost 4 stars, and you'd think they would have great oysters since its specialty is oysters.  I ordered the dozen oysters, which smelled fishy once they laid the platter on the table.  The shells were yellowish green like it was bad.  I decided not to knock it unless I tried it, and yep I was right. The oyster was small and sour. Definitely not worthy of $13. I then ordered the clams, which were ok.  It was big & meaty, but the sauce was so bland--it killed it.   It came with corn and sausage which was basting in the same flavorless sauce.  I was really disappointed in how everything tasted after the long awaited anticipation.  There was nothing wrong with the service.  The staff was friendly and attentive,  but I would never recommend this place to friends because of the food.  Sorry, just being honest."}
{"text":"This is a very laid back bar, old looking decor, definitely not the hot spot in town however the food is great! I think is a really cool combination to have seafood at a bar! There are plenty of tvs to watch sports and they always have drinks specials! If you are craving some shrimp, crap legs or oyster then I would totally recommend for you to come here ..,"}
{"text":"We are originally from Wisconsin so finding a good fish fry in LV that meets our expectations has been a challenge. We've been to Shucks three times now and have to say that it the best we have found in town. They bread their haddock in house and the fillet is a generous portion. The house cole slaw is also very good. I've also tried the snow crab and was very pleased. 

The atmosphere is pleasant tavern, clean and efficient. It has a few TV's to fulfill the sports bar requirement but they are not intrusive. Staff is very friendly and the food comes promptly. We give it a solid recommendation and are putting it down as one of our regular spots."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are on a getaway date, staying at Mt. Charleston. Needless to say they messed up so we came back into town for dinner at Shucks. We sat in the dining room and Jeremy was our server, let me tell you I have never met a more friendly, courteous, outgoing server in my life and I work on the strip in the restaurant business! He definitely saved our date night, made amazing recommendations on what to order drink wise and food wise! Give this kid a raise and let him know you appreciate him. People like him are a rarity these day! Thank you thank you thank you Jeremy! We will be back just to see you!"}
{"text":"I came here around 12:40am. I forgot my id but had a picture of it on my phone. The guy that works at the bar said, no id you gotta leave. Basically he threw out customers he could have sold oysters to minus the alcohol. I do those this place already."}
{"text":"I was craving shrimp ceviche so I came to this bar, I got it to go and the portion was all right, could have been a little bit more. It was also overly salty, but I didn't hate it"}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and service. Always fresh seafood especially the oysters! Surprising for being in Vegas. Happy hour is nice too. Never disappointing"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. They have amazing service and amazing food. I'm from Florida, but I will have to say their crab is way better. They have a couple different options on how u want it seasoned. Cooked to perfection. I've never had a bad meal from here. I recommend this place to everyone. -5 stars-"}
{"text":"If you want seafood at 3 AM this is your place! I tried the crab legs they were fresh and prepared well. The flavored butter was a very nice touch. You can get the crab with different flavors- old bay is what I tried you can't go wrong with that. The bar has video poker, it's an average style vegas bar. It's nice to have someplace to go for late night seafood if your looking for something different."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great for those seafood cravings any time of day or night. I am from the east coast so if there is one thing I know, it's claim chowder and boy does this place do claim chowder right! It has great bar atmosphere and I love that you can seat yourself. My favorites are their crab buckets, popcorn shrimp, claim chowder (duh) ahi tuna, and po boys! .... and pretty much everything else. This is def. a must eat spot!"}
{"text":"Been here several times.  Love crab and oysters. Last visit was Friday the 7th the entire visit was a disappointment.  Service was slow, inattentive and rude.  Oysters smelled and were not fresh.  I ended up paying for eating 2 of the 6 for a few days. What a shame! I've been here before and loved it"}
{"text":"If you're from the south and looking for fried food, you'll be disappointed, but for the most part it wasn't a bad place. I got the fried shrimp and fried oysters and they were mediocre. If I were to go back I'd probably try something other than fried seafood. The staff was extremely professional, polite and tentative."}
{"text":"I'm here all the time great staff love it. The breakfast is possible the best breakfast in the area. Great deals nightly on food."}
{"text":"I've read a lot of the other reviews and will consider trying this place again one day based on those. They get two stars from me because they are open and serve food 24/7. I've worked restaurants all over this country and know 24/7 is a struggle itself. I personally didn't have a good experience at all. I walked in, all be it during their \"down time\" I'm sure. I was one of 5 people in the place. Two team members eating at a corner table(everyone has to eat and I'm in no way put off by this.) The dishwasher was sitting watching tv, again breaks happen and that's not bothersome to me. My issue is that there was one lady at the bar besides myself. She had maybe a sip of beer left for the 15 min I was there(would be my last ever here if I was her). I came in to grab a bite to eat and an application since I was new to the area then. Sadly I was never even offered a drink, much less would I EVER work here now. Maybe next time the bartender that I literally stared at the whole time I was there will realize she is in the customer service industry. Randomly tapping on her register but, really texting and on her phone the whole time is very obvious and frustrating. Especially to someone in the industry. I'll have to go in when they are slammed on a Friday night and see if the staff is ready and on point for service then or if they just have a great location and are only getting business because, this is Vegas and they are one of two bars in the immediate area. Which the other bar a couple doors down always seems to be busy no matter the hour and they have great food, drinks and service. Hopefully next time I will actually get served here and can rate the food, drinks and service instead of lack there of. I think I was extremely fair not just giving 0 stars. Not possible but, that's probably what this particular visit should have received."}
{"text":"Best crab in town!  Always fresh.  Wings are great as well.  Everything we order is excellent.  Been here several times.  Waiter Jeremy is awesome!  Couldnt ask for better service!!"}
{"text":"I was craving oysters for some odd reason, so I pulled this place up.  I'm glad I did!  Granted I lost money on Keno, but it was a great time nonetheless.  Not sure why some people have said they waited FIFTEEN minutes for a drink?!  Um, the bar isn't that big.  The bartender, Shawn, came right over to me when I sat down, as he did with every other patron. The bar is wayyyy too small to ignore someone for that long, so clearly their 15 minutes was like 45 seconds.  Anyway, I really enjoyed this place.  All the people were friendly and I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is so over priced! The thing that is disappointing is the food isn't that great for the price you pay. A funny note, it's supposed to be an oyster bar but they charge way more than if you go down the road to get oysters...hmmm. doesn't make sense. Menu is limited for a price point and for the amount you get and for the quality."}
{"text":"As The Great D-Barns Would Say \"Best Hidden Gem In Vegas\",  GREAT Prices/Food & Service..."}
{"text":"The oysters were sandy ! This is supposed to be an oyster bar why couldn't they have better oysters come on ! I ask for a to go drink and they poured the drinks in a cup with no cap and straw lol my friend ask the bartender what type of drinks do they have and he said almost every drink umm okay like we were supposed to know. Other than that he was nice just the place needs some work."}
{"text":"The service was good. My food was tasty. But my martini was a bit strong and foamy.  I shouldn't be buzzed after eating and having two drinks. Still like to come here. The blackened Mahi Mahi sandwich is my favorite."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time and it is one of our favorite seafood places in Vegas.  The portions are large, the food is fresh and the value is good.  Fridays have appetizer specials for $5 each and we usually chow down on all of those.  The crab is always well prepared and the oysters are tasty.  The service is generally prompt and professional."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast and found that their portions are plenty! They have great selections for right under $5 and I got a steak and egg breakfast for around $8! Amanda, our waitress was very attentive and was able to predict out needs. Great service. Great chill and cheap place for breakfast and it's beyond worth it. Can't wait to come in for dinner! Plenty of TVs for games, fun drinks, and a great seafood/ drink menu. We will be back."}
{"text":"Family friendly that's a plus! Fresh seafood. We had the cold peel and eat shrimp and the warm dunguness crab, cooked perfectly. Served with lemon and butter. Also shared the combo louie salad, crab was not fresh, it was canned but the shrimp was delicious. Lobster roll was devoured and full of lobster. For a tavern was shocked that the drink service was not that great but, we will see how it goes next time as we will be back. The best price for fresh seafood in our area."}
{"text":"$1 OYSTERS?!!??!!?! YES PLEASE~!!! (Thursday Special)

Came here a couple times to take advantage of this special along with some oyster shooters and surprisingly the Oysters have been consistently fresh! The service has always been fast and friendly! 
The only things I've also tried are the french fries and seafood bisque in a bread bowl.. fries are fries.. The soup was a bit on the salty side ... 

HOT TIP: They don't have Happy Hour here ;[[[ .. just daily specials ( Check the board right by the entrance) but on Thursdays it's definitely worth a trip coming to Shucks ;]]]"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in, you'll smell the cigarette smoke. We sat down and waited for our waiter, which took some time. The food was mediocre. I'll never go back again."}
{"text":"1st visit: Lunch on a Thursday. Oyster special (not so special) $1.50/raw oyster, $2/cooked oysters. If you get a half dozen or more it's basically the same as the regular pricing. Nice thing is they let you order less than a 1/2 dozen of each so you can mix & match without spending full order prices.
Ordered 2 fried oysters: crispy light breading, large, plump & juicy, best thing I had there.
2 raw oysters: small and not the freshest
2 oysters Rockefeller: small but good
2 grilled oysters: small, okay but a little dry
1/2 lobster roll ($5.95 special that day): more like lobster/seafood salad roll, looks like a mix of seafood or fake crab w maybe a little lobster thrown in, no chunks of lobster (this a bar that serves food, why would I think they would have a good lobster roll, especially at that price?)
The $6 check-in Guinness offer is of no value, that is the regular price of Guinness there. Deducted a star because the management knows this is of no value and won't offer anything else in exchange. Seems a bit deceptive to act like you're giving somebody a deal for checking in on Yelp when you're really not.
Waiter was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Went here with the family and I would have to say it was ok. I had the steak salad and the steak was not high quality but just ok. Not sure what I was expecting from a steak salad butttttt I still expected better. 
A few in our group had the seafood including my husband and he said it was ok as well. 
The atmosphere is ok and the waitstaff was ok. I guess if your looking for some bar type seafood this place is good for that. I cannot say that I will be rushing back anytime soon but I also cannot say that there was really anything wrong with it. I guess I just expected more out of my steak salad than I got."}
{"text":"Wow we went in to see our favorite graveyard bartender Larry and found out he is no longer there. The service wasnt good. We won't be back"}
{"text":"Great food! Terrible...terrible service. Fabian saw us twice within an hour. Same problem last time we were here unfortunately."}
{"text":"We called in for pick up and ordered the \"Build your own (you choose 4)\" which we choose (1) 2 order (1 lb) of peel & shrimp (2) Rockefeller oyster (3) calamari. We picked it up and when we got home they messed up our order. Instead of peel & shrimp we got fresh oyster . We called them back and they said come back and we will have your \"1 lb peel and shrimp.\" We thought they will make this right this time. We got there and we checked if they get it together but again, people that work there are naturally idiots! We got 8 pieces of cocktail shrimp . We told them that first that is NOT what we ordered!  We specifically told them 2 orders (1 lb) of \"peel & shrimp\" & the guy (he wasn't wearing any name tag) was arguing and totally unprofessional! They messed up on our order the first time and second time we are willing to come back and hoping they will make it right but instead they just ruin our night. It is inappropriate and no respect whatsoever. Don't ever try this place because people that work in this place does not care... I hope karma get to this people."}
{"text":"Would love it if you started offering Fanny Bay or Kumomoto oysters.  Dare I ask for Shibumis?

Doug, the guy who prepares the food latenight, makes the best crab legs.  Had to go for them three nights in a row.  The five stars are for the late night staff."}
{"text":"Two of us ordered their current crab special for two which is absolutely fabulous.  I would recommend they keep it.  The crab was succulent, it also came with crab and cheese topped bread and a crab bisque.  We also tried the oysters and they were quite wonderful also."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I like coming here for the clam chowder. You can get it in a bread bowl. And it's a lot cheaper than panera. It's open 24 hour and also serves breakfast. Great place to eat for cheap and works for hospitality hours."}
{"text":"$3.95 breakfast can't be beat. 

Got the chicken fried steak and though it' not Texas large, it's a decent size and good gravy. Better than some chicken fried steaks I've paid a lot more for. Eggs were cooked right, potatoes crisp outside and soft inside...

...basically comfort \"normalicious\" food (stealing that from Yelper Angela H's vocabulary). 

Yes, it's not the best breakfast I had- but it's solid and a much better alternative to a shitty night at a Denny's. It starts at 12am so stop by for your after drinking breakfast noms. Beats a lot of the graveyard specials in taste and price."}
{"text":"The customer service here is amazing. Tonight with a full house, we were taken care of by 3 different servers. All with polite manners. 

Only thing that's changed since my last review is the food. 

Ordered:
Mother Shucked with garlic fries
1 pound Dungeness crab

I have tried the Shuck burger and the mother shucker in the past and am quite familiar with the taste. Now, the flavor is just not the same. I've been giving them a go since I moved here in 2013, and there seems to be something different about the seasoning. 8 of 10 on the juicy rating, (well that's considering I get it medium rare). And for the Dungeness, tonight seemed a bit dry, maybe a bit over cooked. This has happened to us several times in the past 6 months. Not consistent,  so may just be different cooks. What I can say is, gotta try the garlic fries! 

Definitely love the way the crew treats their customers, and how attentive they were. But I'll give it another 6 months try before updating again, just to see if it's just me or a change in cooks that's making my tongue confused. Sorry shuck 3 stars for now, but I will be coming around."}
{"text":"I think this place is definitely a matter of opinion.  This place certainly is NOT great, but it's definitely NOT bad either.  It's very average.  The menu is definitely over priced, the portions were a decent size. I'm shocked for a seafood place that they don't have scallops.  I tried their lobster bisque and it was a bit thin, a little salty and it was just ok.  I would actually say that the same soup at red lobster was twice as good.  (and just fyi, there are plenty of things at red lobster that aren't that great either, but as far as soup goes, they win) 

The breading on everything wasn't too bad but a lot of the fried items were bland and definitely needed more seasoning in their breading/batter.  Their calamari was ok but I would've liked it to be crispier (just a matter of opinion is all)

All in all,     I probably won't be back, nothing here made me say yummm or oooh or wow etc.   and Hushpuppy is better and far cheaper

and I will give partial credit to our server, she was very nice from start to finish and made sure we were taken care of.  There was a small accident when our entrees came out though.  While setting them on the table, they were setting them down/moving so fast, that the ramekin of tarter sauce fell off upside down onto my dad.  Luckily my dad moved very quickly and caught it upside down in his hand.  No real harm done and she did apologize and got extra napkins and such, but a manager should always stop by just to apologize as well and or offer a dessert or take a drink or something off the check (nothing big but just a small peach offering so to speak, is always appreciated)  Again no real harm done though and all in all the dinner was good just not great and not for the price."}
{"text":"We drive by and there's a sign...oysters! Should we? Hmm it's open 24hr. Is it gonna be fresh? Is it busy enough? Yelp to the rescue!! 

As you enter through the double doors you see that they have a load of daily specials. Always love a deal but we're still not convinced. Once inside, we can see its a comfortable locals spot. We get chatting with the waitress, who was so welcoming, so we dove right in. 

Tried: tuna tartare, peel n eat shrimp, gumbo (amazing presentation), ceviche, clams, and oysters. 

Everything was great! Its smoke free with video gaming on a portion of the bar. They have full liquor, tv's, wine (1/2 price bottles that day) and a decent beer selection. 
I saw PBR on draft! Sold! 

It's definitely a very affordable and consistent seafood joint. Heard about their great breakfast, it's on the list....Glad I live so close, for my late night oyster crave..."}
{"text":"Eh, it had it's good and bad qualities. In the mist of my bar hopping I came across this place. Keep in mind that I've actually never eaten crab before. Oh yes, this gets stupid.

When I first walked in I wasn't given a greeting, I'm assuming cause they probably thought I was some middle school kid that wandered in lost. The spiderman backpack I had probably didn't help. Oh well, my problem. 

I pop a squat up at the bar, away from some obnoxious other patrons. That's right, I knew they were obnoxious the first 5 seconds I walked in. Kinda sat their awkwardly for four minutes. The other two bartenders ignored me. Thought I was waiting for mommy to finish her beer perhaps? Most likely. Could have asked though, you big jerks!

 Finally a young lady came out and greeted me with a menu, I already had my ID ready (good job following the law!) and after a few minutes I ordered a beer and the crab bucket with a mix of the two types. One, cause I don't know the difference and decided if I'm going to fuck this up, I'm going to completely 100% fuck everything up!

They brought me out all the wrecking tools used to annihilate the crab legs, and I had no idea what to do. I played creeper and watched the guy a few seats down from me work his magic and then just tried to copy him. Could have I asked the waitress? Don't boddle me with your logic!

While it was good, I must say crab is not my thing. I'm one lazy ass bitch and sitting there for half an hour to get a handful of meat is not on my to-do list, but might be a good way to starve off the fat bastards we have on our planet. Seafood for everyone!"}
{"text":"Best Tavern , food atmosphere friendly people Family oriented. Great staff. 
Ask for Victor. I love this place, like home."}
{"text":"Come here on Wednesdays when their sandwiches/wraps are BOGO. Friendly, attentive staff and wide variety of menu options. Their drink specials are a steal as well."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Great menu for people who dig seafood. 
$1.00 oyster night on Thursday :)"}
{"text":"Let me get you up to date -

They changed the menu. They are now giving less food and upped the prices. This is very sad. The food is still good, but I'm very disappointed on how they made the changes."}
{"text":"I like it, good costumer service, delicious food:) my Loui salad was perfect, my husband san which delicious!! The beers super cold."}
{"text":"The food was better than average. Would come back if I needed food late at night. The pieces were good and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"5 stars for the surprisingly good seafood, super CHEAP prices for graveyard/HH, and the very friendly staff!

Drinks were heavy handed and kept coming!  Toss a couple bucks in the machine to keep yourself busy as well as the drinks :P

BTW, I asked whether they were KID FRIENDLY...they said YES!  Just not after 11pm...

One of the best places to eat late...look at these prices!

Oysters on the Half Shell ($1 ea after midnight!). These were pretty good, but even better at a cheap $1 bill each! Can't even buy em on the east coast for that cheap! 

Oysters Rockefeller ($1 ea after midnight!): Garlic, Spinach and Monterey Jack Cheese. Again, can't beat the price on these! Overall pretty good.

Peel and Eat Shrimp ($4.99 after midnight!): 1/2 lb boiled in a seasoned stock. These were served hot, and had lots of flavor and Cajun seasoning. This HAD to be way more than 1/2 lb though...there were tons of shrimp!   Tasty :D

Fish Tacos ($9.95 not sure of HH price): Grilled or Battered Cod, Roasted Red Pepper Dressing, Pico de Gallo and Seared Cabbage. Not bad! 

Waffle Fries ($2.50?). Lightly seasoned...good!  We used these as a starter until midnight hit!

The food is probably only a 4, but at those prices, everything tastes better LOL

Pics!  :"}
{"text":"The hubby and I come here about once a week and we always leave happy and satisfied. The drinks are stiff and the food is good.  Really, what more can you ask for from a bar?  I usually order the crab Louie salad. The first time I ordered it, it was way too overdressed now I ask for the salad dressing on the side.  Problem solved. The seafood in the salad has always been really fresh and plentiful too! The last time we were there the hubby ordered the fish fry.  The fish was a very large portion and the batter was oh so yummy.  I have been recently ordering the snow crab and have never been disappointed in the freshness an quality of the crab."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to placed for some good crab legs. Service and food quality have gone down hill over the years."}

{"text":"So I came here with my parents while I'm visiting them in Vegas. The location is easy to find with plenty of parking, but I wasn't impressed with Shucks Tavern. When you walk in, it is DARK. There's a sign that says seat yourself, but it really isn't noticeable when you first walk in. We sat right off the bar area in what I guess is the dining room area. Being from LA, I can't get over people smoking inside bars. I guess Vegas' law says you can smoke in the bar but not in the dining room. Um... the dining room is the same room as the bar so I don't know how you'd escape the smoke. Whatever. I ordered a strawberry daiquiri off the menu only to be told that their blender is broken. For our meals, I ordered fried shrimp with fries w/ steak fries. My mom got a shrimp po'boy w/ regular fries, and my dad got a combo shrimp plate w/ steak fries. Mine came out as ordered but I had to ask twice for lemon. Mom's came with steak fries, which she doesn't like. She wanted regular fries. And dad's came out missing the coconut shrimp (which is part of the platter) because they were \"all out.\" Long story short, something was wrong with at least one thing on each of our plates. Hello?! The service here was really iffy. The food runner looked like he was scared of the customers and our server was full on eating a meal while we were waiting for our check. We probably won't be back because the food was nothing special and the service didn't impress."}
{"text":"I only come here for the alcohol. So I haven't really had the food here that is not the chicken tenders. Now the chicken tenders are top notch. Outside of that, the alcohol is a bit pricey unless it's happy hour. Even then, they need happy hour more often. Now back to the food part. 

I've been here a few times and mileage may vary. My first time, I was with co workers and we waited over an hour for our food. Granted we didn't leave because we were all drinking but if it wasn't for my co workers being there. I would of just left and get food elsewhere. The following times the service was much faster."}
{"text":"Great low price breakfast..

Friendly service and large plates go a long way here.. 

Never go back for dinner ever again..
The food was not good. We had 8 people and all ordered different and it was all bad.
Not happy.. we really wanted it to be good. 
Bummed."}
{"text":"Smoke-free equals lots of stars from me! That's the main idea of this paragraph. It can be hard to find an establishment that offers video-poker that is smoke-free and serves decent kibbles, but if that's what you're looking for, look no more. Shucks is the place for you.

(I don't play video poker, but I appreciate the plight of those that are trying to keep their health while doing a little gaming.)

Shucks is known for seafood, but I am not a huge seafood eater, so I will just say that my husband, who does, likes the snow crab legs, but did not like the oysters. The oysters are farm-raised. 

I have had two different entrees: mahi fish tacos and their Black and Bleu salad. I would definitely order the fish tacos again. The only minor complaint is that the tortillas are flour, and I love corn. The salad was not incredible. It is a good value because it comes with a nice portion of flat iron steak. However, the steak was dry and under seasoned, and the lettuce a bit wilted. If executed better, I am sure it would be delicious, but on the night I visited, it fell a bit short. 

The other great thing about Shucks is that they have some type of special every day of the week. Most notably, $2-3 drafts every Monday and Wednesday. Kids eat free on Sunday. There's more, but you'll just have to roll up to find out. It will be a fun surprise for you."}
{"text":"This is my local bar and could forever be my favorite bar no matter where life takes me here on out. All the bartenders and servers are excellent and they do not short change you on any of the pours. Food is excellent if you like seafood and they have generous food deals every day of the week. Bears fan? Look no further for Bears games -- I do not want to spoil the enjoyment for you, just check it out."}
{"text":"We love Shucks and the food, we used to like to go there and gamble while having dinner or lunch.  The reason i am giving only 3 stars is not because to the food.  We have attempted to go there 3 times in the last month, each time we go in the bar is full which is where we like to eat because we are big gamblers as well.  My problem is each time we have walked around the bar every machine is occupied and 5 out of 10 are with someone either talking to another person, playing on their cell phone, or eating and there is no money on the machine nor are they playing.  The bar tenders at most of the places we go to will not let us walk out and instead will ask someone not playing to please let us have the machine.  NOT SHUCKS they always watch is walk around then watch us walk out.  To bad you don't want the gamblers in i will not be attempting again their loss."}
{"text":"I recently craved oysters, so I hit up the neighborhood oyster bar just down the road.

The joint managed to achieve a casual ambiance that comes off as authentically relaxing and working-class, rather than hokey or contrived - an unusual feat both for an oyster bar and for Las Vegas.

We started with four appetizers: crawfish, crab & spinach dip, calamari, and mussels.
We ordered the crawfish out of season due purely to my friend's curiosity, and their presentation was in fact rather curious. I still don't understand why they served them in the hot water in which they were boiled. This only resulted in burning our fingers when we went to peel off the shells. The crawfish had an acceptable flavor and consistency though for being of Asian origin.

The crab & spinach dip is something I would order again. With plenty of Parmesan cheese, it was definitely a savory dish, and I could taste very little of the sweet crab flavor.
The calamari was passable, but barely so as the tempura batter lacked any seasoning, and they were fried at too low a temperature, which resulted in oily breading.

There was something wrong with the mussels, though I still can't put my finger on exactly what it was. They just smelled putrid, not unlike a rotting eggplant or tomato. They tasted perfectly fine though, and neither of us got sick, though it took a while for me to get that smell out of my nose.

Next, we moved on to what we came here for with an order of oysters Rockefeller (here known as \"oysters New Orleans style\" - there's another menu item here called \"Oysters Rockefeller\" made with spinach and pepper jack cheese). They were no match for Antoine's, but then again, they were pretty damned good. I'll be getting those again. Butter, lemon and Parmesan cheese were some of the main ingredients. They were perfectly seasoned and grilled.

My friend got the steak and crab, which was a flat iron cut with snow crab legs, mashed potatoes and vegetables. I got the lobster role. The steak was cooked perfectly medium as requested. It was a quality cut and not over-seasoned. The snow crab legs tasted fresh and had a rich sweet flavor. I'd definitely recommend getting crab legs here. The potatoes were well seasoned, good consistency, and had the skin in, as I prefer. The ratio of lobster meat to mayonnaise in my lobster roll definitely favored the lobster meat, but not so much that the sandwich ended up dry. I recommend it as well.

One of the best features of Shucks is its cost-value ratio. On Fridays at least, that appetizer special was unbeatable, even if we did strike out on a couple of them, and even the menu prices were a great value. For its ambiance, food quality and value, Shucks is definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Arrived around 6:10pm on a Saturday night, the hostess sat us down right away and promptly got our drinks. That was the best part of the experience.

Then, we waited for our server to order our dinner. And waited, and waited, and waited. 

15 minutes later, our server arrived so we could order. Crab cake appetizer to share, lobster Po Boy for the wife, and I ordered one of their signature burgers. Garlic fries with both of the sandwiches.

15 minutes later, the appetizer arrived.
Crab cakes were mediocre, at best. The presentation was nice, the Cole slaw was decent, but the crab cakes were over cooked.

15 minutes later, our dinners arrived.
The wife liked the bread of her Po Boy, but the sandwich was missing the tomatoes that should have been on it. She also liked the garlic fries. It was a good size serving, about half her plate, with a good ratio of garlic to fries.

My burger was supposed to have their \"Shucks\" sauce, but it was so dry, I couldn't tell if it had it or not. I got about half of the fries that my wife received, but, my fries had much more garlic. When I finished eating the fries that I could, there was a three inch mound of garlic left on the plate. Simply not edible, and I like garlic!

15 minutes later, we received our bill.
Of course it was wrong, the server had added an order of oysters from the table next to us, to our bill. 5 minutes later, we were able her about the error and she said that she was going to correct it. Then, they tried to deliver the order of oysters to us. 

Laughable at best. 

This is one of those combination gaming pubs/restaurants . Not crazy smokey, but noticeable when you walk in. 

The tell tale sign was there when we walked in; there were open seats at the bar, a little after 6 on a college football Saturday night.

It didn't seem to be too busy, but it took well over an hour to get some crab cakes, a sandwich and a burger. Might have been an off night, but I'm not willing to chance it again. This place deserves zero stars."}
{"text":"Great Service. Comfortably atmosphere. Was a little disappointed they didn't have clam chowder available, and the broccoli cheddar soup was kinda bland. The scallop sliders were delicious though."}
{"text":"Husband home from working in the PA woods for a few days and we have to hit his FAVORITE place for the best mussels known to man. 5.00 mussels Friday nights."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the 2 for 1 burgers with endless fries! ... The oyesters are not bad either but not worth the price... Service was ok and you'll probably spend $10-15 on a meal."}
{"text":"Great for the price and awesome staff. Never a disappointment. Great drinks. Thursday is oyster shooter  day 2 bucks for a oyester shot. Great location."}
{"text":"I was happier her in my first visit. The second time, not so much. Our server sucked the second time around. I'll still retire for the coconut shrimp! It was amazing."}
{"text":"I mostly go here because the bartenders are really cool.  They really take care of you when it comes to service and making you feel at home.  The atmosphere makes me feel like I'm sitting in a garage but I find it cool.  I usually go for the seared Tuna which is great...  I've gotten the crab buckets a few times, I didnt get the oysters b/c the waitress couldnt tell me where they were from, I'm from Florida so I kinda take seafood seriously...  For late night snacks and drinks with friends I would definately check it out, its tucked away in the corner across the street from Smiths by the way"}
{"text":"Great bar food here and small but decent selection of beer.  It's pretty smoky in here though. Not sure why they continue to allow children in even though they have a 21 and over sign. There are kids in there every time. They should remodel if they want to be a family friendly place and care about their guests."}
{"text":"Love their food and they have great bartenders!  We went in to have breakfast and sat at the bar to play, but wish they would not allow cigar smokers."}
{"text":"I was told this place had $1 oysters at midnight.  Since I'm allergic to shellfish, I don't really care, I came here for the company and not for the food.  For people like me, there are non-shellfish options such as fish, chicken wings, fries, burgers and alcohol!

We sat at the bar.  They have black jack/ keno machines, etc.  The bar tender was cool.

I got a Malibu Bay Breeze per Honny's recommendation as I perused through the menu. The waffle fries comes with ketchup and ranch dipping sauce...they were good.  It must have been the alcohol or I simply had a death wish because I ordered Rockefeller oysters when I didn't have Benadryl.  I remember liking them when I was little before I developed my allergies.  It seemed like a good idea at that moment until I ate 3 oysters and some of my friend's Cajun shrimps - and my arm, my face and my back started to itch and my stomach started to hurt...the only thing I was waiting on was the anaphylactic reaction.  Centennial Hills Hospital is only a few blocks away so I wasn't worried.  Good oysters though...spinach, cheese, oyster with a bit of hot sauce...mmmm...

In New England, you can get a dozen oysters for $12-13 at a very good restaurant.  Shucks' $1 oyster at midnight = $12 for a dozen from their Graveyard Menu...sounds like a good deal to me.  They're open 24/7 too and also on their Graveyard Menu: burger with fries for  $4, wings and fries for $4-8, chicken fingers and fries for $5-10, shrimps for $5 and clam strips for $4.  Late-night cheap eats!"}
{"text":"Schucks Burger is a thumps up
Shrimp Po Boy is a thumbs up
Flat Iron Steak is a thumbs up
Never seem to have clam chowder anymore

Machines get a bad rep in this place! Sing up for the club to spin the wheel."}
{"text":"Yummy! This is where I go when I crave American-style seafood. They have affordable prices and big portions for the money. I love their oven bakes the best which are usually good for two people and are basically seafood (mussles, clams, lobster etc.), potatoes, corn baked together. I love the intermingling of flavors and the freshness and the size!

The deserts are also great as are the drinks. The 24 hour part is definitely a plus just in case I am craving some lobster at midnight (has happened before). 

I like the decor. It's simple, but effective. This place is rarely crowded, and seeing how I hate crowds, it's a major plus for me. The wait staff is very good.

I miss this place since I moved to SW part of the valley. I'd like to try the other Shucks closer to me, but this one on N. Durango is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best late night oyster spot.

Food is always great, super awesome oysters along with friendly bar tenders. It bums me out we don't have a place like this here in So Cal, but then again that means i cant burn it out, right? 


I may be a little blind to what good oysters are, but it makes me smile and that's all that matters."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i went there and had a pretty good meal. We were waiting for 2 gaming machines to come available at the bar. There was an elderly couple playing then they got up and sat at a table to eat their dinner. We sat at the machines they were playing and i moved a napkin from the top of the machine. From behind me i heard, excuse me, we are playing that machine. There was no money in it. I asked the bartender about this, and this is what pissed me off, she said \"why did you want to play this certain machine?\" I said we just wanted to sit together and play. The bartender stuck up for the older couple. You should not be able to hold a machine while you go off and have your dinner. BAD Bartender-bad customer service. We are new to vegas, but we are still paying customers. We had a great waiter, but what followed left a really bad taste in our mouths. Shame on you Bartender. This happened on 12-4 in the afternoon. Bartender needs a lesson on customer service."}
{"text":"Great fresh oysters, lobster roll and shrimp ceviche were on the menu when we settled into our table in the bar.   Great service, great food, and a big menu..fresh seafood, burgers wings, entrees , and dessert.   Great prices on wine and beer."}
{"text":"I love Shucks-- $1 oysters on Thursdays!! I 'll take 30- so good. =)

The oysters are so fresh here. Actually all of their seafood is fresh and good. The gumbo is really rich and tasty. Every night of the week they have specials and their breakfast is 3.95 for all items. 

The service is always good and this is a Cowboys bar. If you come on game day, good luck, it will be jammed packed."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED!!! Management sucks and so does the bartender Sean if you get him. They have good breakfast specials and that is it, their oysters and seafood aren't even fresh. Use to be a fan of this place but after the last time I will NEVER be back again."}
{"text":"came here for some late munching (or more like pigging out) and ordered oysters, linguine with clams, lamb chops with salad, and jumbo shrimp.  i'm not an oyster eater but i was told it was pretty good.  the linguine was definitely very very yummy but if you're on a diet, i'd say stay away from this pool of butter.  the lamb chops were average, not nearly as good as the ones we has at texas de brazil the night before, but the salad that came with it was pretty good.  altho i'm sure you're not going to order some lamb chops just for the side salad.  last but definitely not least, the jumbo shrimps.  they are jumbo alright... these \"shrimps\" are more like lobsters!  they tasted so good.  great texture, lightly seasoned so it's not overpowering, and it comes with a little tub of butter.  i had them w/o butter and they were delicious.  would definitely come back again on our next vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Giving one star because the server was attentive and did remove the shrimp we sent back from our bill.
I read about this place on Buzzfeed, \"10 best places to get crab\". We ordered;
Snow crab, this was clearly frozen a long time. Very dried out with very little flavor
Dungeness crab, just meh.... Nothing special.
Peel & eat shrimp (hot). Way over cooked. 
Chicken tenders, fries and chowder. Tenders were over cooked as were fries. Chowder tasted like it came from a can and was so salty it couldn't be eaten.
I will never recommend this place, nor will I try it myself again."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here many times. The service can be hit or miss, but the food has always been good. My husband is especially fond of the lobster rolls. I have also been here a few times with friends to grab some drinks. Prices are pretty average for the city."}
{"text":"My family comes here on a regular basis when in the mood for seafood. It's a great neighborhood joint with a super cozy feel. The service is always top notch and the food is consistently fresh. My kids love the popcorn shrimp kids meals, and having to help them finish a few times i can attest to the fact that they are quite tasty. I can't bring myself to ever order anything besides the Clambake. It includes 1lb of snow crab legs, 1/2 lb of dungeness crab legs, 1lb clams, corn, potatoes and sausage. I have not yet been successful in actually finishing it but it never stops me from trying. My 10 year old shares it with me on most occasions. As a matter of fact, this was her restaurant of choice to celebrate her most recent birthday. We had 11 guests in all and the service was seamless. I called in advance and they set aside an area for our large party. My Dad raved about the fish fry platter, so I might have to try that at some point. I'm also curious about the breakfast specials!"}
{"text":"My bf and I were looking for a good place to go for breakfast besides Ihop and Denny's, this place fit the bill. They offered a decent selection of 10-12 meals with extra sides at the bottom of the menu for a couple dollars more. I had your typical breakfast meal (2 eggs, 3 slices of bacon, hash browns, and an english muffin)...  everything was cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful! Don't expect Claim Jumper portions but you will get a filling meal for only $3.95! The waitress was fantastic and had a great personality which is very rare these days! We will be coming back soon to try out the dinner menu and will definitely be recommending this place to people in the NW."}
{"text":"We are close enough to walk here.  It's been in the neighborhood for a long time.  Last year we came on Friday's several times for the $5 appetizers and really enjoyed them.  The same thing we are enjoying tonight!  The fried calamari was light and crispy, served with a pretty good dipping sauce, and the crab and artichoke dip was served pipping hot!  It had big chunks of crab inside.

I ordered the blackened Mahi Mahi fish taco's, it was a little disappointing, the fish had hardly any flavor and were small.  I have had better items from their menu.  The prices are good, the service is excellent, overall, it's a good place for some fairly decent seafood."}
{"text":"I can't even list any stars for this place tonight, but listed 1 since Yelp reviews require it. After ordering our first round of drinks (which a couple folks never even receiver theirs), we never saw our waiter again until someone from his staff went and got him an hour later.  I'm not really sure how you ignore s table of 12, but maybe he didn't like tips....just terrible service overall."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Had to search for our server to get a condoment.
The Tuna Wrap was great. Very fresh and large portion."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best seafood I've ever had! They had such a great variety and big portions! Great bang for your buck! Also They even brought my daughter out a piece of AMAZING chocolate cake for her birthday! It's a must try!!"}
{"text":"Music is always good - love the classic rock playlist.  Fish is mostly good for almost every dish on menu.  Most is fresh which is hard to filings in Vegas.  Marty bartender is awesome.  He came from Shucks on Eastern & Serene.  Tons of TVs.  Good local vibe.  My favorite dish is the blackened chicken tacos with their signature salsa."}
{"text":"Came here to meet up with friends. We just wanted to eat, drink and catch up. Sorry to say I don't know our servers name, but he knew we were there to talk and enjoy  the company.  We ordered round after round of appetizers over a three hour period and he was great.  The oysters were so good, we ending up getting three dozen by the end of the night. Most places like to turn tables quickly, but they were patient and courteous with us. We asked for tortilla chips for the dip because one of our group could not eat the flour chips, which have a great spice sprinkle, with the amazing crab dip, and their response was immediate.  The shrimp ceviche was fresh and flavorful. Mussels had a fantastic broth. Thank you for an amazing night."}
{"text":"The night staff is super friendly. My co-workers and I enjoy going after work. The breakfast is pretty average and so are the prices. The chicken fingers are average as well. The day staff is a little grumpy but It is our night time in the morning. There are several bars to choose from and this one is not on the top of the list."}
{"text":"I like the friendly and personable staff, their Menu, and the fact that Classic Rock and Roll is played as you enjoy your meal and company."}
{"text":"For a little offsite bar, I actually find their oyster and seafood selection to be excellent.  

Some odd years ago, I fell in love with the concept of oysters.  While Vegas is absolutely nowhere near the beach, their selection is pretty tasty and reasonably priced.  They also serve a great selection of seasoned seafood.  Their appetizer selection is solid, and their drinks are most definitely not watered down (their Bloody Marys are stout), but if you want to pretend that you're at some little seaside hole in the wall and just munch on shrimp and oysters, then this is most definitely your place.

I'm more surprised that I haven't reviewed this place already.  I go over there fairly regularly when I feel the need for some reasonable, off-Strip seafood that isn't sushi.  One of the nicer aspects is the fact that they really do have a wide variety of seasonings to cover your meal in, and I'm a sucker for Old Bay seasoning.  Their sandwich fare is also excellent.

Like I said, it's a little bar/restaurant place.  I like the fact that it isn't smoky, the menu is pretty diverse, and the staff are nice  My only real downside is that it is a little far from my side of town but really, if that's the worst thing, then I can manage.

If you are a shrimp and oyster fan, then go nuts here."}
{"text":"Okay place when you're in the mood for seafood and don't feel like driving to the strip. Although we've never hung out at the bar, it does look very enjoyable to have a nice conversation while sipping on a long island iced tea.

When we do visit, we enjoy the fish sandwich and anything crab they sell. And don't forget to get the criss-cut fries..."}
{"text":"One of the better seafood restaurants in the northwest part of town. It's was a buy busy and took about 15 minutes to receive our drink order, but the waitress was consistently checking in on us and was very polite. Great place we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pros:  The $3.95 breakfast
The selection is limited, but the options are good.  I really liked the sausage patty croissant sandwich that comes with hash browns.
The portions are not huge, but I like that.  It's a good breakfast for the price, and you don't walk out feeling so full that you can't move.

Cons:  We've been here half a dozen times, and have never run into any kind of a drink special.  For just a local, no frills, tavern kind of bar the drink prices are a little high.    

I might come back for some cheap country fried steak, but I don't think I'll be drinking here anymore.  There are just too many better options in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"Was my favorite place for years , now I'm beyond disappointed with their food and service . First .. I frequented a few times a week because I loved the iced tea . Fresh brewed and was so good . Now it's on the gun and doesn't even taste like tea. So gross ! So instead of saving money you are losing money from those of us who don't drink soda. Water is free . Portion sizes have gone down a lot . If I have to pay for 3 orders of chicken just to get a normal size amount on my nachos (and I'm not a huge eater ) then I think it's time to find a new place . 15 years of consistently being good to changing things monthly . Sad ! Oysters up in price and down in quality. whatever you are doing isn't working . Bring back your old service and products ."}
{"text":"Brought my son here to watch the NBA Finals and for the wings and tenders! We had wonderful service from Jonnae! Great food and cold beer! See you soon!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, they have always found us a place and the food has never been bad. OK we are in the desert and know that nothing is caught here, but that aside for a good value off strip meal they are hard to beat"}
{"text":"I had the Shucks fish fry. It was great! My only complaint was that I could have eaten more of the fish. I wasn't too find of the coleslaw, but Im not a fan of that in general. The service is also great, and my baby loved the clam chowder."}
{"text":"We love shucks. My husband and I come here every Wednesday morning for breakfast and sometimes my mom and I come for dinner. Their food is great. Joe is their best waiter by far. Great service and friendly."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious oysters and they have deals on their wine. YUM!"}
{"text":"Used to be a Cowboy Bar with a crazy atmosphere filled with knowledgable fans. I guess they couldn't survive through all the Romo injuries either, because the place has died out tremendously now. Hence the 3star rating. However if you want a local bar that has surprisingly good to very good seafood & gaming, this is your place."}
{"text":"Crab legs here are simply delicious. I love this place, it hasn't failed me. & they're 24 hours! If you want a crab legs and oysters and a nice beer this the place. They even have seafood benedicts! I always go for the raw oysters and dungeness king crab legs with potatoes and corn.  Making my mouth water writing this lol"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago which means it's hard to find a restaurant in a different state that'll meet your taste buds but this restaurant here is definitely the best seafood restaurant I've been to and the service is great!"}
{"text":"I love seafood therefore I love Shucks. Great fresh seafood priced non-Strip. To those negative reviewers here I offer them some sage advice. Don't go to a seafood joint for burgers or steaks. For god sakes this place is known for its great seafood. If you love seafood you'll love Shucks."}
{"text":"a good place to catch a Chicago Bears game and food and service is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Friendly staff and cheap prices with good portions."}
{"text":"I love clam chowder in the sourdough bowl ,they make very good food and doing good service,  we'll be back"}
{"text":"Went to Shucks for the express purpose of having oysters on the half shell. I ordered a half dozen. I lived in New Orleans and great Gulf oysters are available there year-round. What a disappointment at Shucks! The oysters were small and spindly and tasteless. One was so small I had trouble finding it in its half-shell.

I followed with the seafood bisque which was excellent but eat fast; it's best piping hot.

Realize that the two stars are for the quality of the oysters not the tavern. I first ordered a Heineken which was served in an ultra cold glass. It was most welcome. The bartender was very friendly and my waiter was attentive and friendly. The tavern itself was not smoky.

There are four TVs placed in such a way that only a few can see them well. There was only one broadcasting a live baseball game, the others, sports history  (I watched rerun of Super Bowl XVII, Balt (34) vs SF (31), still exciting). All-in-all, the tavern is a pleasant place (early Sunday evening) and well run. It was just the oysters that piqued me.

After going to Shucks I'm wondering whether a restaurant can advertise itself as an oyster bar year-round in a desert city. Oysters are mostly seasonal unless one lives close to the source (such as New Orleans or Houston) so we here in the middle of the desert may not be able to get quality oysters certain times of the year. Just thinkin' out loud here."}
{"text":"Love this place! Come here regularly with some buddies to catch up and get a few drinks at the bar. Food is bomb, staff is friendly, and prices are fair. Would recommend this place to anyone looking to relax at a great bar and grub on some delicious food."}
{"text":"Favorite oyster bar in town. Love the food and staff. Very convenient and a++ a Bears bar"}
{"text":"Agree with the John Taffer comment, I think we encountered the dumbest and laziest bar staff in Vegas. A crowded bar with a lot of unhappy people. So sad we just got up and left

Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Our whole family has been coming here for years.
Sometimes with the kids and sometimes without. We took our granddaughters there today for lunch because their mom is in the hospital across the street. We walked in, sat at a table, and after about 10 minutes of waiting for menus and the girls telling us how excited they were for their sliders, and happy to see them smile after such a stressful beginning to the New Year, a waitress walked up and said kids weren't allowed in there. Fine....you changed your rules. But someone could have approached us when we first came in and not 10 minutes later. Smooth move people. We are definitely former customers - there are about 12 of us that used to frequent there. The way we were treated on such a stressful day definitely proved that this establishment does not deserve our money. We will be talking about this to everyone we know."}
{"text":"Bad service, and so so food. 
Overpriced for what you are getting and I pay to have good service too which never happened"}
{"text":"I ordered a one pound burger It was the biggest burger I've ever seen
I ate the whole thing very yummy service was ok"}
{"text":"So our first time coming here was a pretty bad experience. My husband, and brother in law, and myself were in the mood for some seafood, and decided to give this place a try after seeing some of the good reviews on yelp. 
When we first walked in we werent really greeted, so we just found an open table (that wasn't covered in old dishes that hadn't been bussed yet). About 15 minutes later we had a servicer come take our drink orders. After about another 15 minutes we were able to order. My husband ordered a crab bucket, his brother a shrimp bucket, and I Ordered a shrimp poboy. We also got two appetizers the calamari and the clam strips. 
The calamari was burnt to a crisp, like crack your jaw and slice up the inside of your mouth burnt crisp. And the clam strips were more like fat little clam chunks, I've never seen them cut up that way. And they were very tough. Unlike the calamari they were at least edible, unfortunately there were only like 4 clam strips on the plate. All together the appetizers were very disappointing. 
By this time we've long been out of water. And couldn't seem to catch the attention of the 2 servers that were rushing around past our table. Finally when our food was brought to us (maybe other 15-20 minutes had passed) we asked the server who had brought the food for some refills, and tried to place an order for a drink. She kind of stared for a few seconds then repeated the drink order and said alright no problem and seemed to be off to put the drink order in and bring refills. We never saw her or our drinks the rest of the night. 
The food we ordered was ok. The portions for the shrimp and crab buckets were very small. Both meals came out in small bowls, with an empty bucket to throw the shells away in.. so I guess that's what the bucket part is about. Which is very misleading.
All in all it was not a good experience. I'm not sure if we'll be coming back here. It's a shame too because we really wanted to like it since it's so close to our house."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE. Stopped here on a friday morning between 2-3am, craving for some oysters, it was just in the neighborhood.. i have been here before (at an earlier time of the night) and i liked their food. Its not spectacular but it can still satisfy one's cravings. We were asking the bartender (only guy in there) what dishes do they have for oysters except for raw. He threw us the menu and said, \"thats why theres the menu\" i have never been treated rudely as a customer like that! Right then and there we left the place! Didnt get the guy's name but WOULD NOT recommend this place, very disrespectful and rude staff running this place someone like him shouldnt be working there or anywhere!"}
{"text":"Another night of Monday Night Football with friends and this night we decided to try Shuck's, a place I had been to 6-7 years ago on a late night and recall having enjoyed their food.  We settled in at a table that was not entirely satisfying because the view of the TV screens were a bit awkward.  Too small, too far, blind spots... eh, not great for MNF.  Nevertheless, we are hungry, games have started, and staff were nice so we decide to stick around.  Despite being a sub-par venue for game-watching this particular night, it was still an enjoyable evening.

I find Shuck's to be quite unique in its offerings.  It's not an uppity oyster bar, but it is an oyster bar.  The setting is casual, almost Joe's Crab Shack-ish, but more laid back and better menu.  It has a long list of seafood menu, including buckets of variety of steamed items such as crabs, clams, crawfish, etc.  Fried seafood entrees, variety of seafood soups, wide selection of seafood-based apps,  clam bakes, and pastas, not to mention the requisite variety of oyster dishes and even non-seafood sandwiches, make for an extensive menu.  Happy hour was over so there wasn't any great deals in place, but I find their prices to be quite a bargain to begin with so I think it's worthwhile anytime.  

I did not taste others' dishes, but myself had the crab & spinach dip and beer battered coconut shrimp basket.  The dip was especially good, with meaty chunks of crabs amply mixed in.  The shrimp was also very good, not too bready and full of sweet, coconut flavor.  Fries that came with it was pretty good, nothing spectacular.  I did try a bit of my brother's fish 'n chips, and that was quite good as well, with crispy and light breading.  Solid 4 stars for the food, especially considering the reasonable prices.

I'd like to come here more often and try to knock off a considerable amount of items on the menu that has some very interesting dishes.  Friendly service, casual atmosphere, and good prices make it a definite spot for having a few with your buddies, in spite of the TV ergonomics that could use some work.

Table-for-1 Factor:  There is a large, long bar where you can, and many did, sit by yourself and watch the game.  In fact, it might be preferable since the good TV screens are at the bar."}
{"text":"It was our first time here. I had the fish and chips, which were fantastic. Nice and crisp served with a house made tarter sauce - also very good. My husband had the shrimp combo platter. This platter comes with 4 coconut shrimp, 4 hand breaded shrimp and 4oz. Popcorn shrimp. He enjoyed the popcorn shrimp the most. The coconut shrimp was a little bland and the hand breaded was tough and very fishy tasting. On Sunday's they have a 2 for $20 deal on all of their seafood entrees and 1/2 price bottles of wine. Overall it's a great atmosphere and well definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"Truly the best seafood restaurant in Las Vegas.Fresh ,delectable and the price is reasonable!"}
{"text":"This place is great..it's clean and the food is amazing ...the best coconut shrimp I have ever had.. my boyfriend had the taco sampler and it was delicious.."}
{"text":"We waited at least 30 mints to get our appetizer and then when you came the food came right after. The stake was raw and the shrimp was really oily. Never going back"}
{"text":"Often we get poor service, but keep coming back for the fish fry. You get a HUGE fillet of fried fish with fries and slaw for $11. I never leave hungry or dissatisfied with my food."}
{"text":"I like this place. Both locations. All is good. ALWAYS. Not top quality fish but for what it's worth it's good. The staff is friendly and always happy to help. I go with friends, I go with family. No problem bringing the kids. It's always a pleasure."}
{"text":"Favorite night to go here is for the Monday night special buffalo Chicken strips and always order fries with them. It is a great place at night not a lot of people and you can get whatever table you want. Its a great locals place. 
The food we have tried here is good. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"The first time I went here about a year ago the food was ok. Had the lobster finger appetizer and they were pretty good. 
So, last night when I went I was so disappointed when I ordered the lobster fingers again and they weren't that great. Overlooked, over breaded, dry, and chewy. 
Then I got the pan roast with clams. On the menu it says that there is also shrimp, crab, scallops, and white fish in the bowl. There was 1, ONE, scallop, 2 shrimp, 2 tiny pieces of white fish and NO, crab!!!!  For $18.95!!!!  What a ripoff!!  
Also this place is a borderline dive bar. It reeks!!!  I mean literally the place smells disgusting!!  There is no barrier between the people smoking at the bar and the tables where you eat. And that smell hits you as soon as you walk in the door.  And this place is also so loud I was starting to get a headache!!  And I'm hard of hearing!!  Do not go if you want to speak to the person you are going with!!  It's that loud. Big screen TVs everywhere and I swear they had the volume turned up on every single one of them. They weren't all tuned to the same station but they were all tuned to some kind of sports!!!  
Oyster Bar?  No!!  This is a sports bar that you can get some substandard food that resembles seafood. 
I won't be back!!!"}
{"text":"Jaqueline is the best server. We first met her when she was a bus girl 2014 She was doing all the work while our server was tending to other quests. There was one time she did all the work and we gave her the tip because the server personality
was not on duty for us but it was to his other tables. I know I wrote about that incident. Nevertheless she became a server probably about 16 months ago. We have been coming in the day time and we look for her but I have not wrote about it because I could not remember her name.
I did call up there one time and told the Mgr. about her nd again I could not remember her name. However this time we got her name and looking forward to her serving us again. Her performance and personality is awesome. 
We ordered the Crab & Spinach dip always awesome. First time ordering the wings 
{Monday's  are  Wings and Chicken fingers} Special We got the Wings Hawaiian 
and they were extremely good. I thought the sauce was a little to spicy but my husband loved it. She let us taste the sauce before ordering it on the wings I opt to sauce on side. There blue cheese is soo good. I had the fried oysters {12} of them hubby had the Dungeness Crab and then he ordered the snow crab.
Everything was excellent. Nice service good food this was the perfect day.
Thank You Jaqueline 
Hope to see you soon"}
{"text":"I like Shucks a lot for the no smoking and Carina is an awesome bartender/ waitress always friendly and attentive.  Then there's the food primarily seafood but great pasta, burgers and fish and chips.  I'm glad there's no more paint night, couldn't get into the place before.  It's great for late night dinner."}
{"text":"Does this place ever disappoint?  Not so far for me!

This time I began with a dozen cold and very delicious oysters on the half shell and a side Caesar Salad that was fresh, cool, and enhanced by a surprisingly good zesty Caesar Dressing.  This was followed by a generous portion of nice and flaky fresh Parmesan Halibut with drinkable Lemon Butter Sauce that was paired with tasty moist Rice Pilaf.  Meanwhile my dining companions enjoyed Fish & Chips with colossal Onion Rings, and a Crab Bucket containing equal parts of Dungeness Crab and Snow Crab, along with great Roasted Red Potatoes.

We again enjoyed fine service and an overall five-star dining experience!"}
{"text":"This place is AWSOME!!!
The food is delicious!!! Next best thing then  Actually eating off at the wharf in San Francisco. This place I would recommend any day of the week.
Looking forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"What I usually order is the 2 1/2 lb snow crab bucket ($5 off on Saturdays), dozen half shell oysters ($1 oysters on Thursdays) and their borracho oyster shooters ($2 oyster shooters on Thursdays)... Oh sooooo good! The crab legs are lightly seasoned and always warm, the oysters are always fresh. You have to order the fried cheesecake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for dessert. Delicious! It is definitely one of my favorite spots to go to!"}
{"text":"Taste: -1
Creativity/Authenticity: 2

Bang for your buck: 3.5

Are you serious how is this place still open??!! what are you people eating here? Should have stuck with my first instincts and not stopped here; but i love oysters and never been to this spot so my curiosity spiked and went in... bad idea first off having only one type of oyster does not make you an oyster bar. Second got the clam chowder and the fish tacos Eeeek me thinks not is right!!! the clam chowder was ok but the fish taco WTF!! first off how do you mess up fish tacos? well other than the cooked cabbage and frozen fish this is the worst fish taco I have ever had. Break down the fish was def frozen and tasted like plastic, the shrimp taco was also frozen and tasted like plastic and to top it off why would you put the deep fried fish on top of the cabbage? im guessing they let my tacos sit for a while because when i got my tacos bam cooked cabbage nice and soggy just the way no one likes em. The only reason this place even got one star was the service the waiter offered to replace our tacos and when we said we didnt want anything he even took it off the bill, good job thank you"}
{"text":"I'm conflicted. Cigarette smoke, crap beer selection, ho hum atmosphere and great seafood... What?!? Wish the restaurant had better separation from the bar, so you don't walk out smelling like an ashtray. Half pound of Dungeness was great, though likely not enough to get me to come back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for seafood. They have really tasty $5 appetizers like crab cocktail and crab and spinach dip and calamari and the shrimp combo platter is outstanding with the pineapple dip it comes with. You can pretty much watch a game from any table you are at. They also have super cheap breakfasts although I've never been."}
{"text":"Worst Bears bar I've ever been to.
Place is filled with smoke.
Food is average.   Service was not friendly.
Neither were the bears fans."}
{"text":"Love this place... 

Great happy hour specials and the two guys running the bar and kitchen are awesome. They never try to push you to order anything extra, they don't force you to hurry.. They are very laid back , attentive.. Never charged me for any extras or messed up our food.

You cannot beat their $1 oysters and their burger combo ( fries, cheese and mushrooms included) for under 5 bucks. 

My brother tried the seafood omelette, and was impressed with the taste and the price. 

The only thing is that they don't have the best beer specials, however that is easy to overlook with all the other great things this place has to offer.

We are going to come back every chance we get.. I'm looking forward to trying their regular menu."}
{"text":"This has to one of the worst places I ever ate, gumbo has absolutely no flavor it taste like water. The oysters where obviously pre shucked and refrigerated with the worst seafood taste ever. The shrimp cocktail looked so dry we sent it back. Had the Fish n chips for first time in years and well I guess it's gonna be years again before I give them another shot. The fries are very small and pathetic. My friend said the shrimp po boy was ok but still couldn't get the second half down. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Love this place since seafood and Las Vegas are normally hard to combine. Since I am from the NW (part of the country) and near the ocean, I thought the portions were a bit small for the prices. Creative menu and drinks, some of them I have never heard of and enjoyed tremendously. We had the clam bake for two that was just enough for one of us (we love seafood and grew up with it) and I had a pasta seafood dish. Tasty. Atmosphere was nice although the occasional drunk from across the bar made conversation a bit rough at times. Seat yourself, you choose your booths! Would go back anytime but probably when I got paid again since we left after spending $130 for two."}
{"text":"I have been going to Shucks for quite some time now.  I am pretty dissappionted in the one star reviews on here.  There is a pretty big group of us that frequent the place, all of us being in F&B so we're pretty picky.  Being in the business we all get off pretty late and tend to get there near graveyard.  Mickey will start us off & Larry keeps us there.  The reason we still go there, after SEVERAL years, is the customer service.  Larry makes us feel at home & pays attention to the small details that make the difference.  I am the a manager of a restaurant in a hotel and Larry has always stood out as what I would want in a great employee.  AND we order the $3.95 breakfast specials....  Maybe the difference in our experience is we all know how to treat people that are serving us & working their butts off, with respect!  
Save your one star reviews...  This place is a gem!!"}
{"text":"The only 24 hour bar close to my house. The food here is great, prompt, clean, and great service."}
{"text":"I've been to Shuck's on three separate occasions in the last few weeks. Each time I have had a salad. 

The first time I had the shrimp Caesar. It was plentiful for the price, the dressing was delicious and the lettuce was fresh. The second and third time I stayed consistent with a black & bleu which is a steak salad wth Caesar dressing and bleu cheese. I would never think the flavors would go together but it's splendid combination. The steak was perfectly cooked as well. 

They have excellent drink specials and prices are on point. The atmosphere is like any other bar in town. Nondescript and dark, but the food more than makes up for that."}
{"text":"I came in on a Friday around 5:00 P.M.
We sat down in the bar area immediately. It was probably 10 minutes before we put in our drink orders and then another 10 before we got our first round and the wait times only got worse from there.
At one point there ran out of glasses."}
{"text":"My mother-in-law is visiting from Hong Kong and looooooves raw oysters.  When I saw that Shucks had $1 oysters on Thursdays, I knew that I had to take her here.  My husband and I had treated her to Joe's Stone Crab the weekend prior, where she devoured really expensive, albeit delicious, raw oysters.  So, obviously the $1 oysters weren't going to even compare.  

The oysters on the half shell were quite small, but perhaps I need to come on a non $1 each night, to see the true quality.  I also ordered a cup of the seafood bisque, and it was OK.  My in-laws ordered the clam chowder and they seemed to enjoy it.  By the end of lunch, the two of us ate 3 dozen raw oysters, and although they weren't the best I have ever tasted, it was nice knowing that we didn't break the bank to get our fill.  

The service is friendly, but it is a little too smoky for my asthmatic lungs. We sat in the non-smoking section, however that invisible wall does not prevent the smoke from seeping into my air space.  If I wasn't so sensitive to the cigarette smoke, I would definitely return.  It is a fun atmosphere, and a great neighborhood bar for sport lovers and seafood fans."}
{"text":"I love coming here for breakfast. I would like to consider myself a regular. It's inexpensive & never have to wait to be seated like most breakfast places. The staff is super friendly. It is a bar but I come here with my family on weekend mornings, totally don't even realize I am at a bar. It's decorated in Chicago sports gear! So today, I noticed a new menu & the churro waffle is to die for. You don't even need syrup! Love it."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a few years and this weekend I decided to stop in and check it out. I love oysters so I was pretty excited- I was a bit surprised by the inside but still excited. I grabbed a smaller table by the bar and anxiously looked through the menu. It was just a drink menu but I picked out my drink and was looking forward to the lunch menu but no one greeted me. No one came to my table. No one served me at all. They looked at me but didn't acknowledge me in any way. So I sat there. And sat there. And sat there some more. It wasn't busy there was several dirty tables that needed attending to but they weren't busy cleaning any of them. I saw at least 5 servers/bartenders and not one came to take my order. It was a major disappointment."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab some steamers and a brew.  They also have some standard seafood fare like fish and chips, and clam strips, but their soups are pretty above par as well.  I've never been disappointed coming here for eats and the 24/7 angle is great for night owls like me. Hoot!"}
