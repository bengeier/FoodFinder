{"text":"Finally a character store in Oakpark. Started with a \"Freakshake\" and was delicious. The store owner was friendly and seemed excited to prepare these shakes for her customers. They were expensive at $13 a pop but they are a lot of work and come with about $6 worth of candy in it, so kinda makes sense on price. Wish the shake itself was a little thicker.  I have been by a couple times in the morning to pick up coffee and they have been closed... guess coffee audience isn't their target."}
{"text":"Cute, clean place! They have some interesting things on the menu so it's fun to try out new things. Tried the saffron almond health milk and it was great. The staff are lovely and very engaging!"}
{"text":"Great new place in the neighbourhood ! Nice place to bring the kids for a crazy freakshake and ice cream / gelato. Their coffee is also organic and you can really taste the difference ! Will be coming back many many times, really nice find !"}
{"text":"Finally a place in the neighbourhood that is a fun place to visit with the family. Ice cream is delicious and great and not too expensive. The coffee could be better but it's not bad. But it's an enjoyable time, the food is good, and can walk with family! Have been visiting once a week since it opened."}
{"text":"Came for the freakshake stayed for the atmosphere.  There are so many options to try!  With summer around the corner you could come weekly and never have the same thing twice.  This shop is open late has great customer service.  The staff are genuinely trying to make your experience exceptional from beginning to end.  You should definitely stop by!"}
