{"text":"The male barista was incredibly rude and threatening to me when I dared to wait for a friend on the outside chairs before I ordered anything. I've never had anyone in any business speak to me so aggressively. I'm telling everyone I know to stay away."}
{"text":"Great ambience and love the purposeful lack of wifi. It actually makes you productive!  Their peanut butter brownie is delightfully sinful."}
{"text":"I tried to have brunch here with a couple of friends on a Sunday afternoon. We were all left with the strong impression that the staff really didn't want us there.   I was the first to arrive and as I sat and waited, I got zero customer service. No greeting from the staff and no offer of anything to drink. When my friends arrived, the staff person behind the counter watched them sit down and get comfortable, and then leaned over the counter and told us they don't do brunch anymore. Please note that none of us had told her yet we were looking for brunch. For all she knew, we could have been there just for coffee. She made no attempt to find out what we actually wanted, nor did she offer us anything. Not coffee, or tea, or pastries. Nothing. She just told us they didn't do brunch and then stared silently at us until we got up and left.   It's worth noting that at the time, their FB page and website advertised brunch offerings and they had just been named by BlogTO as a great brunch place. This article was also posted on their FB page. My friends and I left and had a great brunch elsewhere. A couple of us posted complaints to their FB page, and our comments were deleted with zero response from cafe staff or management. This cafe hosts a lot of musical and literary events that I would like to attend, but I refuse to patronize an establishment that treats its customers so poorly."}
{"text":"Not sure if it was some kind of bs hipster commentary but the wifi coffeeandbeer is non existent, not that it would matter anyway because there aren't any available plugs. Couple that with an unfriendly stink eye giving barista and you have got a 101 on how not to do business. The place has a lot of potential, it's beautifully decorated and has lots of cool stuff on the bookshelf, not to mention the best Americano I have ever had. It would be helpful to either declare it a wifi free zone on the outside board or to invest in actual wifi and punch some outlets into the wall. If the issue is the fear of lingering $3 paying cutomers for 6 hours or more, set a time limit on your wifi. I personally try to buy something every 2 hours because I know how hard it is for a small business to survive. I'm sure the owner knows some tech savvy hipsters who know how to set up a router. Or perhaps that's too much work?"}
{"text":"Best coffee, worst service.  Ive been here many times for coffee, which I think is consistently the best in the area. Unfortunately the sulky, tired, glum, unhelpful attitude of some staff is also consistent. Enjoy your coffee, tip accordingly."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite cafes in the city. I live in the east end of town but still trek out here. The look and feel of this place is awesome. The staff are so warm and friendly and the coffee is brilliant. I love coming here."}
{"text":"This cafe is a little gem squished between a row of ugly convenience stores, auto shops, hardware stores and chicken wing eateries. I visited on a quiet Sunday morning and just grabbed a cup of drip coffee, which was just $1.50.The service was fast and very friendly and the coffee was strong and fresh.   The inside is pretty big with plenty of tables and free wifi. There's a great metal bar that runs across the front window and a few comfortable lounge chairs in the back corner. In additon to coffee drinks, he also has a lot of baked goods and sandwiches. The sandwiches are pre-made, but looked quite fresh. One of the options was a turkey breast sandwich served on thick muesli loaf for around $5 or $6. Apparently the baked goods are from a few different bakeries in the area, including omg.   My biggest complaint is the cafe's hours. It isn't open on weeknights, closing at 4 p.m., so, it's not very convenient if you like an afternoon or evening coffee."}
{"text":"There's some serious potential here. It's well located, quite a big space, and everything shooould be just fine.  I need to give it another shot, but the one time I went it was underwhelming. I still reluctantly go to Starbucks whenever I'm passing through the area. Maybe they'll win me over next time."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday and it definitely surpassed my expectations. I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo and my girlfriend had the huevos roncheros waffle. Both were really flavourful and fresh. The coffee is always amazing. Portion size is pretty big. Love the laid back and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"No internet for customers, no plugs for computers. The decor is nice and blandly trendy; the menu is limited but decent. Bottom line is, if you're paying $5.00 for a double latte, there are other independent businesses to support and still get your work done. I  haven't been here in over a year; they used to have wifi -- and way better music playing. Not a fan. Won't return."}
{"text":"I can't condone anyone choosing Starbucks over this locally owned little gem.  Excellent espresso (unlike starbucks flat burny dreck), great atmo, yummy homestyle food (highlghts: gooey pecan tarts and the fantastic soups)...."}
{"text":"One of the best cafes I've been to in Toronto, or anywhere for that matter. The coffee is exquisite, the snacks are excellent and there is always something going on there. Seems to be a real culture nurturing ground for local musicians."}
{"text":"Had a delicious, creamy cappuccino here.   Overall the place is fresh and clean and gives off nice vibes. I always like when a cafe includes a bar area at the front where lots of light comes in, facing the street.  Minus one star for the small size vs. price, but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful and I've had a lovely americano there before but I went in today to get some work done and munch on a brie and apricot sandwich and I was told rather rudely that no, there was no wireless and if I wanted to pick up on the signal next door (the laundromat) I should go next door. I couldn't believe how rude the guy was. I overheard him saying to someone that he was the owner, apparently he doesn't care about getting business. I ended up riding over to the Holy Oak and getting a great sandwich, wireless and a much friendlier atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My friend and I found this place around the block after an event we attended to. We are not from the area and knew very little of the streets either. Looking up Yelp, we thought this place serves brunch eg. eggs benedict but when we arrived around 3pm on a weekend, it was not the case.  Nevertheless we were hungry, so we ordered food and enjoyed our stay. You would go up to the cashier, pick your food and pay. I got the Chorizo sausage burrito alongside an earl grey latte. The lady there toasted my burrito, which was nice. The burrito was unexpectedly good with flavour and tasty. It wasn't the spicy kind but dipping it in the side salsa helped too.  The cafe was petite but gives off a cozy feeling, although I found it slightly dark as you gradually sit and relax. The furniture and style is also quite interesting and weird at the same time - it combines various art styles in one place. Overall, it's a nice neighbourhood cafe to spend time with friends, but I wouldn't visit specifically out of my way."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Friday early afternoon It was quiet, calm and they had a sign saying bring your own vinyl Friday's, how cool ?  But out of no where my friend and I dared to ask the barista for a glass of water. She looked at us with utter disgust and then just pointed to a jar of water with cups near by.  Instantly we knew we had to run, but there was no way out. She quickly transformed into a three headed dragon and starred at us, her fresh new pray. We then proceeded to ask for an espresso to distract the dragon. We drank those shots like they we were our last and sprinted towards safety, which was anywhere but there.  So if you do find your self at this establishment, beware of the three headed dragon disguised as a short haired, trendy barista for she will stare into your soul and you will never be the same."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee AND friendly service.   Often hard-to-come-by in Toronto's cafe scene, and these guys get it right.  When I lived closer, and was there for coffee on the regular, the baristas would be getting my order ready when I walked in the door, and always with a smile.  One of my faves in TO!"}
{"text":"I was thrilled when this adorable cafe opened in my neighbourhood. The coffee is great, the pastries are fantastic and the service is wonderful.  A great addition to the Dundas West strip!"}
{"text":"Used to be my favourite, but now closes very early, depending on business -- 3 to 5pm. To make matters worse, they close the back half of the place an hour or two before that, leaving only the small front to sit in -- not very inviting. Especially when they start mopping the floor with chemicals in that small space they've left to sit in the front... and it's only 2 in the afternoon! When I have been in the front on days like that, numerous people walk by and look like they want to come in, but see the chairs stacked on the tables at the back and decide not to enter -- why go into sit for a coffee when it looks like they're about the close?  They could do with cheaper food options for the morning that are non sweet. Bagels or scones (which are only occasionally there) would do the trick. If you don't *KNOW* that something's going to be there, though, you'll probably just go where you do know what they'll have.   The coffee is still REALLY good, especially when the owner or the red-jeans hipster girl is working, but hopefully they will hire staff to try and BUILD a customer base. Or else, just make it like Cherry Bomb and make it clear you're supposed to buy and leave.   There is no wi-fi anymore, if you care about that."}
{"text":"Great cafe! Lisa is awesome and there is always something fun happening here. Check out open show Toronto to see work by talented artists. There is also live music here on a regular basis. The patio has some nice red heat lamps to keep you cozy on cool evenings. Good location with lovely people and atmosphere."}
{"text":"PATIO in back and DRINKIES in the evenings!! With this new addition, Belljar has it all, for everyone. Let's go through it:  The voyeurs sip tea at the lovely bar by the window. Those looking for breeze on their cheeks and a front row seat to the stream of streetcars adjusting up Howard Park Blvd, sit with cappucino in lap on the chairs outside the cafe.  Readers and recliners curl up with a latte in the sun-bathed sofa chairs. Writers and workerbees munch on croissantes at the tables along the wall. And now, lunchers can enjoy their sandwiches on the sun-dappled patio, and evening drinkers can revel in every space.   Every reason to go. This little jewel is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"The biggest turn-off at this place is the customer service. It's tough to get a smile from anyone working here. And while I come here for the coffee and a decent place to read/work, it wouldn't hurt to be welcoming to customers - regular or not. I'd visit more often if the attitude was friendlier."}
{"text":"Chill coffee spot to read a book or catch up with a friend. Personally, I'm not a fan of mainstream coffee (ahem, st*rbucks etc.) so I prefer local coffee shops with character such as thee.   This place has a chill ambiance with mellow music and inspiring decor. Lots of character, plus the coffee is rich. I got the butter pecan tart which was served straight from the fridge - but it's okay, the cute lil plate it was served on made up for it.   I would go again, great place to escape the fall chill and wind down with a cup of joe and people watch (lol)."}
{"text":"Very good FLAT WHITE. soup on the menu, none available the day I went, put a notice up.. Guy/employee was grumpy, but who hasn't been grumpy??"}
{"text":"I go here often, since it's right by my place and has great coffee. However, I've had an on-again off-again relationship with the Belljar, mostly due to the service. There are a couple of staff who are quite lovely but the behaviour of the guy who works here (maybe he's the owner? white guy with facial hair) is seriously off-putting, even to a \"regular\" like me. Two weeks ago I went there and when I reached the counter I said, \"Hey how's it going?\" He just stared at me and he seemed to be annoyed. I thought perhaps he didn't hear me so just let it go and ordered. But this week I went in with my sister who's here from out of town, and he was pretty rude to us, plus he messed up her order. She commented afterwards that he seemed really annoyed that we had interrupted his chat with his friends there. This guy has always given me a bad kind of creepy vibe but I tried to move past it so that I can chill at my local coffee shop. After these interactions I won't go in if he's there anymore. I sincerely hope he is not the owner; I would not want him to be my boss."}
{"text":"A friend had mentioned that this was a great quiet place to get things done, but she didn't mention the horrible barista that serves in the afternoon.   Yes, I know that traditional coffees are best served with full fat milk, but the look of disgust when I tried to order a skinny drink was ridiculous. Clearly my first time at the cafe, but there was no signs of good hospitality/service.   The spicy Italian sandwich I bought was yum though. Too bad about the service though. Coffee was better than Starbucks, but I've had better. Don't think I'd be back again."}
{"text":"Ummm, I love this place. I'm spending the week in Roncy dogsitting for friends and the Belljar came recommended for local coffee. From its name to the cozy vibe and decor, to the friendly barista that lets you decide how much water is enough for your americano to the excellent tasty baked goods and snacks. I come from a neighbourhood full of coffee places and this place is better than all of them.  Come on weekends for tasty freshly baked croissants to ease into your weekend and some much-needed java. Also, there is wifi and drannnks in the evenings."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Greater people. And love the Ravi soups and simple sandwiches.   So happy that this is in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"The best brewed coffee in the west end! Great muffins, great service. My workout buddies and I go here at 7am when the coffee's very fresh, but I have brought home a cup to reheat and it's just as good."}
{"text":"If you want to be treated like crap, or like you are inconveniencing someone by ordering something then this is the place for you. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night. The space itself is really cute, with lots of seating and fun decor. Great music playing. I hear they have shows on some nights and I think that the space would be great for that. My friend and I shared a piece of carrot cake (really good) and a ginger cookie (not so good), and each got a tea. Decent prices and not too loud. They were serving cocktails too and they looked pretty good. Anyways, this was a decent place to get a warm drink."}
{"text":"What a lovely little gem! The minimalist retro decor, the warm service, the eclectic tunes, and the tantalizing array of pastries and sandwiches make sipping a cup of warm beverage of your choice on a chilly day liken getting away to a new and far away place that you somehow already know and love.   On the weekday afternoon that I stopped in with a magazine and a couple of hours to kill, Belljar Cafe was packed. Almost every single seat from the window-facing stools and small two tops near the naturally lit front section to the cozy and dimmer back section was all taken. There were glowing silver Macs, strollers, newspapers, and chatty tea dates everywhere.  Luckily, as my order of a Chai \"latte\" was up, a seat at a low, round, coffee table opened up. I was soon joined by a couple of gentlemen who were also glad to be able to grab a seat. It was hard to ignore the booming speakers which were right beside my head, but I was glad I didn't as the owner's explanation of how it was built to reverberate off of the wooden floors to get that unique sound was fascinating.  The only thing I could wish was different at the Belljar would be a bigger selection of teas. Don't get me wrong, they have a few and they are of the usual and trusty variety. If you're a tea drinker though, you'll know what I mean."}
{"text":"Coffee is fine. Don't come here expecting to get work done though, they don't let you plug in!"}
{"text":"Was in the area on a Friday afternoon. My SO and I decided to try this place out instead of going to Starbucks down the street. The decor and atmosphere were nice, but service was quite poor.   I ordered a tea latte, they told me they didn't have tea. What kind of cafe doesn't have tea? How about a soup? No soup either. The barista looked so miserable and unhelpful as he stood there, unsmiling, unapologetic, telling me they basically didn't have anything I wanted to order.   We ended up paying $18 for a pre-made sandwich that had been refrigerated and reheated, a canned drink, and a pre-packaged yogurt parfait. Bottom line - the place is nice, food is okay but overpriced, and the staff are unfriendly and unhelpful."}
{"text":"It can't make up it's mind as to what it is - but they are a jack of all trades. Great coffee, interesting beers, more than your average fare of pastries and cookies with yogurt, salads, burritos, etcetera.  The patio is beautiful. It's a little loud if anything but don't hate, appreciate, dig the vibe."}
{"text":"Elegant, comfortable, inspiring. Beautiful and delicious food. Always a smile."}
