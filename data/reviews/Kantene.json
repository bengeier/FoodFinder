{"text":"On our way to Erindale park we decided to have a snack. Found Kantene in a little mini mall which has a diner on the corner, Italian deli, a Chinese place and this funky little joint which caught our eye for its nice lighting and sparkling clean white walls and turquoise accents. We had the lamb burger which was delectable. Perfectly cooked and perfectly paired with creamy feta, crunchy deep fried onions, homemade aioli on a fresh soft sesame bun.  We also shared a vegetable sandwich which is bursting with roasted zucchini, eggplant, peppers, mushrooms topped with fresh arugula and melted brie. Again the bun was fresh and tasty. The eggplant fries were crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. The chef gave us a sample of their rosemary onion rings - tasty deep fried goodness made with love. Friendly staff and great value for the price. Please go and enjoy this new hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Visited this newly opened spot over lunch and I was pleasantly surprised! The menu has a lot of clean ingredients, I had a tomato, cucumber & onion salad with cajun shrimp as well as fries which were all delicious! 

Bathrooms were in the basement, stairs are required. I also noticed there were no gluten free wraps although the wraps could be made in a bowl instead which was nice! 

It did get a little hot inside so we opted to eat back at home! 

Overall, very clean, great and friendly staff and we will return as the food was delicious and hit the spot!!!"}
{"text":"Drove by ... saw the sign... decided to go in.... I liked it ... small and simple but the food was on point ... grabbed the Mexican wrap and rosemary end-user rings ... so gooodddddd....."}
{"text":"Great little place with great food. Kids like the Mexican chicken wrap and the pizza. Husband loves the burgers. I tried the eggplant fries. Fantastic! Service was friendly and quick. Only reason I gave it 4 stars was the limited vegetarian options. Definitely will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place after driving by it many times. I ordered the shrimp wrap and my boyfriend got the surf and turf burger. Food was surprisingly amazing, very fresh and great sized portions. We got enough food to leave us stuffed for only $30! Most places cheap out when you order anything with shrimp or seafood but not this place. The man behind the counter who I am assuming was the owner/manager was so sweet and friendly and chatted away with us. He told us the food would be about a 20 minute wait but it was ready in 10. Overall, the food was delicious and well priced and the service was amazing and we will definitely be going back to try out their other menu items."}
{"text":"Neighbourhood-type spot for Burgers, Sandwiches, Wraps, Pizza, & Biryani??!!  Yup, they serve Biryani for dinner, every night.  I think this was an add-on as it doesn't appear on their menu and I just overheard a customer come in and request it.

Good:
-  good product, patties are made-to-order, fries are handcut.  Patty was not dry, but juicy, please see list below
-  buns are from a local bakery
-  portion.  I ate probably half burger/fries, so I did have leftovers
-  interior is freshly repainted and possibly renovated.  It is bright and clean!

Could Be Better:
-  in comparison to other non-chain burger places, prices are on the high side.  Basic burger is $7.50, while other places that come to mind are $5-6 for the same thing.  If you want to make it a combo, it is +$4 (drink/fries)!!!  Location is not high-end, so prices should reflect that
-  patty was thinner, flattened out as opposed to thicker
-  bun was a bit heavy/thick where the patty ratio is concerned.  Bun is more suitable for a thicker patty
-  fries were good, HANDCUT as per menu and speaking to the man at the cash, but they weren't seasoned.  I love that first bite of a fry when it's crispy, drained of oil, and a bit salty/with some seasoning.  I suppose I can add salt myself!

It wouldn't mind if they shrink their portions slightly and price in-line with similar burger places ESPECIALLY for their combos.  Like who goes to a burger place and doesn't want fries with that??

Definitely worth a try, if you like burgers & fries!  Tons of potential here as there aren't any business with the same product in that area.  I hope they find a niche here as this stripmall is somewhat cursed!"}
{"text":"Great burgers. I really enjoyed the lamb burger. I've had it a few times now, never over cooked, always taste great with good toppings that compliment the flavour nicely. The hand cut fries are done perfectly as well, really enjoyed them a couple times now. Eggplant fries are nice but a bit oily so I would suggest sharing them if anything, I wouldn't want the full serving. Onion rings are good but I wish the rosemary flavour was more pronounced."}
