{"text":"Sad that this place has such a poor rating because the breakfast sandwiches and coffee we got were delicious. Best meal we've got in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Service was ok but the food was absolutely horrible. I had the turkey omelette and it sounded good but it was disgusting and the french toast was dry and tasted like dried up bread. I really didn't think they deserved the 1 star to be honest. I'm surprised the Venetian Hotel would even have a place this disgusting in it especially since the hotel is so amazing. If you're staying in the Venetian avoid this place at all cost. It was absolutely disgusting. This place is worse than McDonald's. Do not waste your money here you will definitely regret it every bite of you meal."}
{"text":"Bad visit today  Their fryers are down so no chicken parm, no chicken Marsala, no fries with sandwiches, but you still have to pay full price for the sandwich even though you don't get the side item.  That's dumb af."}
{"text":"When we first approached the counter four people behind the counter and not one of them acknowledged us to take my order. Almost 2 minutes before they took my order  They were so busy gabbing with each other   We ordered two vegetarian omelette and that was the only good thing about the place. The hashbrowns were cold like the other reviews stated no butter on the toast and no grape jelly and no Salsa available for the omelettes"}
{"text":"stay away, manager was super rude and the food tested so bad I'll never come back here."}
{"text":"That was the worst breakfast and coldest coffee I've had in my life. And very rode disrespectful costumer service. What a luck."}
{"text":"Pretty pretty sad food, please spare yourself and don't go here. It would be total waste of money, time and most importantly your Vegas mood."}
{"text":"So for a stall located in a luxury hotel it kinda sucks. My spaghetti carbonara is supposed to consist of bacon, egg yolks, parmesan cheese and cream. I added shrimp to it. Seems that when I added shrimp they minus the bacon. The portion is also small considering it totaled 17 bucks. Also the cashier seemed to dislike her job so much she wanted to express it to everyone with her attitude and demeanor. If they don't fix what's going on I'm sure the Venetian can find something else to fill that spot pronto."}
{"text":"I ordered the Prosciutto panini and was given just plain ham not prociutto. Total bait and switch."}
{"text":"This is barely edible food and insulting to all Italian food court food everywhere !! I'm going to order room service.  Avoid this place !"}
{"text":"For a quick bite for a good price this place works..  great club sandwich,  good lasagna.   Good value for a hotel place"}
{"text":"I have to say this was the best carbonara I have ever had. I love carbonara I get it all the time and top notch Italian  restaurants don't even measure up to this. We also have the Penne vodka and it was one of the best vodka sauce I've had next to making my own. Food is fresh they make it just for you, allow a little bit of time because Great food takes time to prepare. i've eaten at this place for or five times and it's always been top notch."}
{"text":"Yep, first and last time I'm getting a vegetarian panini here. Dry dry dry the fires helped make it taste better."}
{"text":"I have been at the Venetian for 5 days. The rigatoni bolognese At Eats Italian was by far my favorite lowish cost meal. It was fresh, large portion, delicious sauce, and the noodles were perfectly al dente."}
{"text":"Ordered the meatball egg and cheese breakfast sandwich. Check out was quick. It took forever to get my food. The sandwich was good but nothing to write home about. The juice was fresh squeezed and absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"DONT EAT HERE. The most awful service and the food is terrible. Tried to ask if I could order something different and the manager was so mean and she talked about me and pointed for the 30 minutes I sat and ate. She should be fired and so should everyone else here. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"Certainly adequate but nothing special.  A food court Italian place in an Italian-themed casino should be better.  However, it is relatively cheap ($10-15) for a meal in a strip casino, and pretty fast.  Food is made in front of you, rather than reheated in a microwave.  Not sort a trip, but definitely a good choice near the hotel elevators if you don't want to spend $50 and wait an hour for room service."}
{"text":"If you are hungry after a long day of walking and seeing the sights, don't get the lobster ravioli. Mom ordered it after a long walk and she only received 5 ravioli .... nothing more ...not even a bread stick to dip in the sauce. I ended up sharing my dish with her. Felt so bad knowing if she was ask hungry as me that dish would have been a big (super small) tease."}
{"text":"I'm surprised there is a lack of options at the food court here. In my opinion, the Venetian is prestigious hotel. Eats Italian is a acceptable option. It's definitely better than the gas station sandwiches at the cafe down the hall. My advice for dining at a food court is to not get anything too fancy. Anything fancy usually sounds better than it taste. Stick with the easy to make items like the paninis or the caesar salads. That is exactly what I ordered. I got a panini and a side of caesar salad for around $11-$12.   The panini was actually not bad at all. It came with turkey, cheese and avocado. It could've been a little bit more toasty for a panini but it was acceptable. The caesar salad on the other hand came with more cheese than lettuce. I'm unsure if I should be disappointed because cheese is more expensive than lettuce so maybe I got the winning hand. Let's just say I got more calcium than fiber that day.   The food is acceptable here as long as you don't have Gordon Ramsey level expectations."}
{"text":"Food is ok but the wait staff are horrible.  The girl at the fondest on 9/2/16 ay 11 a.m. was so rude and also snapped at me.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"Not worth it! Pasta is not cooked well. Taste is bland. Overall very poor dish. Will not recommend this place"}
{"text":"Worst customer service! I ordered a create your own meal and the options were to add veggies, chicken or shrimp. I stated veggies to which the rude lady who took our order \"uhh, what kind of veggies?\" I asked \"well what kind do you have because all it states is 'veggies' and doesn't give me any other option.\" She sighed as if she was irritated with me so I said \"never mind, don't add veggies, leave it how it is.\" She said \"so no veggies then??\" She was irritated for whatever reason. I let my husband take over and I walked away. I don't care how good the food is, the lady was a completely rude and that was enough for me to never want to come here again. I'm sure I wasn't the only one who complained about her and hopefully the Venetian is aware of the people employed within their hotel."}
{"text":"I ordered breakfast here, which consisted of a veggie omelette, hash brown and toast. The omelette was good, the hash brown was still cold and nothing shy of a patty that comes in bulks in the freezer section at the grocery store. The toast had no butter on it, but was toasted just right. The cashier (Hispanic girl with glasses) that took my order seemed to be annoyed by anything that was asked for. Asked for a cup of water...she was annoyed by that....asked for condiments when I picked up the order.....she was annoyed by that as well. It was obvious that all she wanted to do was take orders, and NOTHING else!!"}
{"text":"Shouldn't even get a star worst Italian food ever and over priced for fastfood. Don't go here I ended up throwing it away and getting eggplant parmigiana at pizzeria da Enzo a couple stores down and it was good."}
{"text":"Man o man, I was excited to come here. But unfortunately the cashier made my experience horrible. Never again. And I also posted a photo of the cashier cleaning the counters while sitting in them. Hmmm!!! And management is unaware if it. How sad. This is how business go to s**t."}
{"text":"Horrible service, liars, crooks. Ordered a grilled cheese and the menu says it comes with fries. Received order with Caesar salad instead of fries because the workers failed to mention their fry machine was \"broken.\""}
