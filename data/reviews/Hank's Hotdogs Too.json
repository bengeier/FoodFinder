{"text":"Best chili dogs in town love this place if your in the mood for wiener shaped food this is your best bet!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Its exactly what I want when I think of having a hot dog. I've been coming here since it was on West Liberty and it has never disappointed. A couple times a year I crave a chili dog and I would never think of going anywhere else."}
{"text":"Hank's is a pretty decent eatery, but lacks any frills or excess, which exactly seems to be their goal. The hot dogs are definitely quality and compete with Dormont Dogs. Where they lack (and fail to Dormont Dogs) is the buns. While they are warm and steamed, they are just basic hot dog buns which do little to make the great dog become truly awesome. 

The price isn't bad ($2-2.50 each) for a basic hot dog. This isn't bad, but it's not much less than a more \"trendy\" hot dog shop in the city. With this being said, I will definitely be back. I only tried the hot dogs, and they were good, but there are many other options. You would think there would be several types of hot dogs, but there really only is 2-3 choices, surprisingly. 

Their hours could be better, too. I went there on a Saturday afternoon, but if I try to go enjoy a burger and fries after work, they are closed.

Check them out!"}
{"text":"While my kids and I really enjoy the food at Hank's, we are left wondering if it is still open. We were in Brookline on a Saturday and were really looking forward to stopping at Hank's for lunch. Unfortunately, the doors were locked. It was about 1 - 1 1/2 hour after the posted opening time. Did the hours change? Are they still in business? Does anyone know?"}
{"text":"Simply delicious. A very welcomed establishment on Brookline Blvd. Simple but satisfying menu. I got 2 natural casing dogs - one was the everything which was especially delicious and one was a custom. The buns were soft and sweet. The sauerkraut was perfect. Overall excellent taste and price. If you like a good dog, you'll like Hank's."}
{"text":"My 3 year old son loves coming here! The prices are good and the food is yummy. Very friendly service too"}
{"text":"Moved from Detroit and didn't think I could find a replacement for an Original Cony dog. While Hanks won't compare to the source, its a good dog with a natural casing."}
{"text":"Note: CASH ONLY!

Like Fiori's Pizza, I passed it a million times when it was Hank's Dog House on West Liberty Avenue before I finally visited and was underwhelmed. 

Well, with a better location (Which used to be the disastrous Il Padrino, before that the mediocre Big Mouth's, and before that the most excellent Uncle Al's. Yes I'm a neighborhood historian of sorts) must come improved food I guess. 

So I stopped in before work and ordered an Everything Dog. Get this: chili, onions, mustard, sauerkraut, and jalpenos. 

Any dog you ever got at a Uni-Mart cannot compare. It will run away when confronted with a Hank's Dog.

Steamed buns also. Oh yes, that matters. 

They have hamburgers and fries too, so I'll definitely try that combo next trip. 

I'm so glad to have a new place open on The Boulevard that isn't a pizza place for a change. 

Suggestion: Please draw up some takeaway menus."}
{"text":"Typical little hot dog shop.  
Stand up counter for eating that is looking out the front window.
Steamed buns are nice.  The buns came out of a Schwebel package.
Homemade chili that is pretty good, if you want a chili dog.  Or you can try the everything dog or have it ur way.
Fries are good and crisp. 
U can choose a natural cased dog as well.
The women that owns the place was very friendly and responsive."}
