{"text":"My favourite place close by.  I get chilli chicken weekly for myself. Generous portions for the price. I always have left overs for my lunch the next day"}
{"text":"Not a huge Chinese fan but it's pretty decent from here! I always call ahead and get pick up! Think they are closing earlier than they were before though called at 11 :20pm on a Friday they were closed :/"}
{"text":"Really not the best chinese food. You can do better. Noticed another reviewer said it was better at lunch. That was my experience as well."}
{"text":"Food was ok and ok prices.  Came out quick for eat-in but it wasn't anything special.  I did expect more since there is competition in the neighbourhood.  Likely won't return, didn't leave a great impression."}
{"text":"I seem to think that at lunch time during the week is the best time to get food here. I've ordered at night at various times like 5, 6, 7pm and the food is decent but when I come and order at lunch time it's better, fresher and tastier. Maybe it's who's cooking at these times. They have the usual chinese food items we are all accustomed to; ie sweet & sour pork, chicken balls, fried rice etc.; & some limited specialities that you would see at dim sum.  
Overall I like the food and there's a small eat in area with about 6 tables each holding 4-5 people. Casual fast food."}
{"text":"Empire Chef is a bit like a food court Chinese restaurant that is in a strip mall.  Order at the counter from a menu board, and select from a really wide array of combinations.

Lunch specials are huge, with lots of fried rice or noodles as the base.  I had a 3 choice combination with sesame chicken, veggie stir fry on a flavourful fried rice.  I gave up on trying to finish it, as much as I wanted to.  I would have meant a two hour nap if I had..."}
{"text":"Fast and cheap.  But blah.  Standard food court fare.  I give one extra star though because the meat was tender and the veggies varied. I asked for plain rice and received fried."}
