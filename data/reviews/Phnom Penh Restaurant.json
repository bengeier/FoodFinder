{"text":"This has been a favorite spot for my husband and I for years!  We got turned onto it by a co-worker and we've been fans ever since.  We love really HOT food, and they make it \"extra hot\" for us.  The Pad Thai is off the hook!  The Beef Hue Soup is killer.  The first time I tasted it I felt like it was the most wonderful thing I had ever tasted in my life!   The newer location on W. 25th street near the west side market has nicer digs than the original location on Lorain Rd and the food is just as good.  When I am in the mood for delicious, hot, viet vittles...there is only one place I can go and that's Phnom Penh!  This restaurant is one of the reasons why I'm so happy that I live in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Phnom Penh moved so 13124 Lorain Ave is now Cuisine du Cambodge, which is run by the original owners of Phnom Penh. The renamed restaurant has now been open just 3 weeks. 

Dinner tonight was fantastic. I had the Hue Beef soup, a soup with round rice noodles, sliced pork belly, beef brisket, and flavored with lemon grass and other spices. I'm not a Cambodian food specialist but am Asian myself and have had lots of other east and south Asian food, and this had terrific spice and depth of flavor. Similarly, the Phnom Penh stirred pan noodle, which seemed like a cambodian variant of Pad Thai, was delicious. Portion size was very generous too.

Waiter and rest of staff were extremely nice and attentive. Really enjoyed the experience. Decor is perhaps a bit sparse, but clean. It adds to the authenticity of the experience, and probably allows them to keep the prices so low."}
{"text":"Finally went here after living in area for years. Why, oh why was I so slow to go here???!!!
Had #94 with chicken and it was one of the most delicious dishes I have ever eaten.Flavorful, spicy, med heat, could taste everything Had to dust off my  Clean Plate Club award after this lunch. 
Daughter had Banh Sougnh, with chicken #83, so tasty!!
Had coconut and pineapple drink, and the Guanabana also. (guanabana is a fruit that tastes like strawberry, pineapple combo)Really refreshing, cooled the mouth, Yummy!! 
WILL be back soon
Inside looked better than I expected."}
{"text":"Dang! I can't believe Alex beat me to the first review of Phnom Penh! 

:) 

I LOVED this restaurant from its early beginnings as a tiny little Madison-Avenue hole in the wall in the Birdtown district of Lakewood. That was the early 90s, and I'm so pleased this restaurant has lasted. They moved over to their current location on Lorain Avenue in the late 90s and are still going strong! 

My favorite dishes are the Vietnamese Iced Coffee (OMG, YUM!), the pad-thai (best I've ever had), and some big noodly dish with chopped up fried spring rolls and coconut milk on top. Again ... OMG! YUM! (sorry I can't remember the name.) 

I miss this spot. It's a family run spot. It's cheap. And it's so good! I have great memories of fighting the rain, snow, and sleet just to get in there and get my grub on!"}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of eateries I find myself missing since I've made the move from Cleveland to NYC, at least not based on the food alone.  But I miss this place a lot.  The menu is amazing just to look at, almost like an educational pamphlet on eating, Cambodian-style.  Lots of pictures.  The prices are good and there's never any wait.  I miss Cleveland."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding.

I dream of reasons to go to Cleveland simply to visit this restaurant. I'm not kidding. This is simply the best SE Asian food I've ever eaten- and if you look at my reviews, I've eaten at many SE Asian food joints in many geographic areas. Other places may have one or two dishes that may be better, but overall this place is the standard by which all other Thai and Cambodian restaurants are judged (and found wanting).  

I always get their homemade Tofu in the dishes and it is outstanding whether in the Loath Chha or Kuy Tev Chha Khmer or just plain fried as an appetizer.  My husband swears by their Pad Thai.  It was the first thing he tried there and finds it so delicious (and our visits to Cleveland so rare) that he refuses to try anything else on the menu, as the torture of knowing such delicious food in one place exists is too much of an exquisite torture.

If you are in Cleveland, go to Phnom Penh.  If you've never had Cambodian or Thai, the servers are friendly and willing to talk you through the menu. The food isn't Americanized, which is absolutely a win in my book. 

When you go though, make sure you bring cash because Phnom Penh does NOT accept credit cards. Now, what are you waiting for- go try Phnom Penh!"}
{"text":"Good portions. The place is BYOB. Sop bring your own drinks.
For those of you that's daring you can get up to 10 spoon spicy on any dish. their typical spicy dish is 1/2 spoon. We got 7 spoon and it was very tasty and definitely had some kick. Definitely recommend to those that like spicy food."}
{"text":"New to Cleveland and went to Phnom Penh based on yelp reviews. It is, hands down, the best SE Asia cuisine I've had in the states.  No question.  I was sad to learn their Lorain location is closing down end of 2010 in favor of the  W25th St and the Olmstead Falls location.  Guess I'll just have to make a drive to it in the future."}
{"text":"Really great Cambodian food, which, to be honest, I don't think I've ever had before. The wonton soup was sweet and had really large tender chunks of pork in it. (By the way, I was laughing at how many items are on this menu - especially the soups! How many friggin' soups does one place have to have?!) 

I also had the Pad thai--my staple because I am boring. This was certainly different, and very good although a tiny bit dry. The flavors were present without being overpowering. (I ordered the regular - not spicy version of this dish.) I've heard rumors that this place can clear out your sinuses if you so let it. I might have preferred a BIT more spice, but was afraid to try because of Phnom Penh's reputation for setting one's mouth ablaze.

Everyone said the same thing about their food - \"Wow, this is different...not what I expected, and excellent.\" Sort of like what lots of out-of-towners say about Cleveland itself!"}
{"text":"Made the hike and drove past the place like 5 times.
It's no longer called \"phnom Penh\" it is now \"Cuisine du cambode\" or something like that.

Food was excellent
Service was wonderful.
Server had righteous tattoos all over his hands
Owner was very polite and service oriented."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic - a small & simple but clean restaurant serving Cambodian & Vietnamese food with appropriate background music to boot. To start with, the hot French coffee with condensed milk is exquisite (Starbuck's look out!) - so good I had 2 cups.
We each had soup, the Khmer chicken & seafood soup (excellent) and the spicy house special Hue beef soup with round rice noodles and beef brisket (also excellent).
We followed with Mikroolaa, a noodle dish (quite good) and original Khmer stirred pan noodles with chicken (excellent - medium spicy was still rather spicy and perfect for us).
I highly recommend this place, and when we're back ion the area we plan to return."}
{"text":"This place is now Cuisine Du Cambodge - a Southeast Asian Restaurant which specializes in Cambodian Cuisine.

This is a must visit place, with the same awesome food as before!
Stuffed Wings are amazing! Pad Thai is the best around! Very authentic cooking!"}
{"text":"back in the hometown with the girlfriend who loves SE asia cuisine, I figured there wouldn't be many options. Well, I found these reviews on yelp and it looked promising. 

they do serve thai and vietnamese as well, which at first seems weird. but really, it's probably because they tried just having Cambodian and people came in asking for Thai. 

I thought the serving sizes were appropriate and spicy (just enough for my sensitivity). I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"This is a Cambodian restaurant; it also serves Thai and Vietnamese dishes.  This is a hole-in-the-wall, and in my opinion it is one of the best and most overlooked restaurants in the Cleveland area.

The food is absolutely top-notch, and very cheap.  I especially love the noodle-soup dishes, but everything I have had here has been outstanding.  The flavors are vibrant, the dishes both complex and balanced.  The selection is large but not overwhelming.  I have no specific recommendations, as everything is good.

There's a tiny lot; sometimes you can park on the nearby side street if it is full.

I miss this place."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in Cleveland and are craving Thai, this hands down the best Southeast Asian food in the city....er possibly the region too.  Definitely divey, but don't be dettered!  This is as good as it's going to get out here.  It is recognized by Cleveland.com and is consistently praised in The Plain Dealer for a reason!

The menu is extensive and explanatory, but holy mary mother of god, please trust me when I say that ordering spicy is REALLY F-ING SPICY!
I recall one trip we could barely finish our meals.  

Also, the folks who own Phnom Penh are probably the nicest people alive and know the meaning of customer service.  Dishes provide heaping portions and are very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The food deserves 5 stars but the dining room had a funky odor- not nice. I think the roof leaked and the carpet mildewed. Anyway this restaurant is gone. Its now Cuisine du Cambodge and Phnom Penh has moved to North Olmsted. Haven't tried either new place."}
{"text":"Now that is some good noodles! I had the phnom pehn noodles which were like pad thai and drunken noodles in one. I got it spicy and it was decently spicy! So that was a great thing! My coworkers got the pad thai and loved it! So if you want pan fried rice noodle, this should be at the top of your list!!!"}
{"text":"Phnom Penh is a great little restaurant on W. 25th in Cleveland.  If you're into trying unique foods, this is a good place to go.  The noodles are really good and if you like spicy, they've got it.  The portions could have been bigger, but I'm a typical American and this is a Cambodian restaurant.

The food and the service was very good and the wall decor was beautiful.  Definitely recommend!
