{"text":"This place is the epitome of great service and excellent food. Me and my bf came in for breakfast and we were very happy with everything.   The place is clean and cool looking. Our server, Joseph, was attentive and spot on. And the breakfast meals looked fresh and beautifully plated. (Not the usual greasy looking breakfast you get at diners.)  Overall, our experience here was excellent and I would highly recommend this place to any of my friends."}
{"text":"Server was friendly and the food was not bad, but the long waiting time for drink was completely unacceptable, especially considering we were one of 3 tables there."}
{"text":"While the service was pretty good the food here was atrocious. The Indonesian shrimp was $12 for 4 pieces of over battered compost. The steak sandwich was literally the worst steak sandwich I've ever had, doused in mayo to compensate for it's lack of taste and general poor quality. Thank God for the cold beer to wash down what turned out to be a truly miserable meal."}
{"text":"Service was friendly though I think my server was new. Very polite and friendly but shy and unconfident.  Food took over 30 min for a sandwich and onion rings. Sandwich was tasty and onion rings were home made though you could tell they were fried in the same fryer used to fry fish since all you could taste was fish and they were SUPER greasy.  Don't think I'll be going back though they do have a great patio. A shame."}
{"text":"Fries were cold and no service. Dorian needs to find a new job.  They got a 2 only because the day before the server was good."}
{"text":"This place is great for summer patio drinks and food.  Tried it recently in the winter and it did not disappoint.  I honestly come back here because of the amazingly friendly servers.  Love the garage!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for a brunch one morning. We both had the eggs Benedict, the egg yolks were not runny at all, and there was barely any hollendaise sauce on them. Bland and not what I expected.... although it is just Garage. I'm all for having a drink on their patio, but don't expect much when it comes to food."}
{"text":"Tried breakfast when they first opened and it was just OK but recently I went back and had the Lamb Burger, which was one of the Best Burgers I've ever had. The burger was perfectly cooked, very juicy and full of flavour. It was served on a perfectly toasted soft bun and topped with Tzatziki sauce, Feta cheese, tomato slices, lettuce and sweet onion rings. The French Fries could have been cooked more and were cool but may have been the fact we concentrated on eating the Burger at first that we let the fries get cold. If you like Lamb or just Burgers this is a place to try."}
{"text":"First time in Toronto. After 5 years. Used to come to this place 7 years ago. I remember back in the day. The breakfast was amazing. It was 20 star breakfast. Now the breakfast is a five star. It's still amazing. Just not like it used to be. The place is clean. Waitress's. Don't look like sluts.  So I recommend to have a great meal here. I will come back."}
{"text":"really nice place to eat some great foods. great staffs, i have to mention this gay waiter working on Saturday morning shift! He was so funny, so nice so fabulous and real nice to talk to lol i accidentally lost my hair tie but he immediately offered me one! He really does have everything ready lol"}
{"text":"A place to be seen, but not to eat. 30 min to get breakfast and not busy. Eggs over cooked, potatoes undercooked, toast not toasted. Pulled pork was dry and they topped off my \"scrambler\" with unmelted shredded cheese. Not one good thing on the plate. At best a $5 breakfast. No garnish. Boooooorrrring. Its breakfast, not rocket science.  Service was friendly though. Overall dissapointing."}
{"text":"Great service. Food is great for pub food and much better than anything in this area. Selection of burgers, pasta, meat dishes and a risotto. Of course there are nachos, salads and typical pub fare. The waiters flirt with you and they have a great patio. The alcohol slushies are awesome. Blue lemonade was my favourite."}
{"text":"This building has been various incarnations over the last several years, the latest being the Church Street Garage. The food was good, but the server we had was about as personable as a used piece of chewing gum.   The place was less than half full at dinner time on Saturday night (we are here on August 22, 2015). There are similar establishments on the same intersection of Church Street. They were full. We had already dined at the others and thought we'd give this one a try. As I said before, the food was good, and probably as good as the other establishments. But I could see the reason why business was slower here: the wait staff, and the overall service and cleanliness.   Our table was dirty when we walked in, and we asked to have it cleaned before being seated. The server made excuses for it and although she did wipe the table, it was almost as if she were doing us a favor.  We ordered a pitcher of Sangria, which was good, but when we sent back one of the glasses because it was dirty, we got the same put-out reaction from the server. This really dampened our enthusiasm for the place.   We probably will not go back."}
{"text":"Now we're talking!  Great service, fantastic conversation, friendly people, outdoor seating, and karaoke until 2AM!  Exactly what could be better than this???  As I was walking past, some guests came out of Church St Garage for a smoke, and one of the people in the group said that it was his birthday.  Not being the rude sort, I slowed down enough to wish him happy birthday and started off again.  Then I heard the karaoke....not great karaoke, not awful karaoke....just karaoke.  I was sold, inside I went.  While here at Church St. Garage, I found interesting conversation with all type and walks of people, including the 70+ year old lady that was the Karaoke winner of the evening!  It was a seriously fun evening, I'd go back in a heartbeat.  The service was great, the atmosphere perfect for a place like this.    And....I won 3rd place in the Karaoke contest..so obviously they have taste in judging these type of things as well!"}
{"text":"Quick summary: Great service, cold beer but overpriced, disappointing food.  The Garage has one of the the best patios in the area. Their beer is always cold and the servers are always friendly and smiling. The patio has plenty of seating and they even have a live DJ sometimes!  Tonight was the first time that I've eaten there and I was a little disappointed. The server seemed very enthusiastic about their food so I tried the chicken wings. $12 for a pound - not bad, or so I thought. When my food arrived, the portion seemed very small and the wings were nothing special - very small with not a lot of meat, and the sauce was too watery.  My friend had the steak sandwich ($18) which was apparently very good, so perhaps their other selections are better.   Overall, a beer and a soda water along with two mains came to $50 PLUS tip which seemed expensive for what we got to be honest.  I will definitely be back for a beer but probably not to eat."}
{"text":"I love this place but the service use to be better and the frie portion are way smaller for the price."}
{"text":"I get the impression that this is more of a brunch or breakfast and beers joint than anything else because we arrived at noon and they weren't serving lunch yet.  Eventually we were able to order lunch, and I ordered the pulled pork pizza, but they gave me a pulled pork burger. The server was great and I did eventually get my pizza, but it was nothing too remarkable.  This gets two stars only because of the good service and decent patio. Even in these areas, there are better places nearby."}
{"text":"3.5 stars****This is a very casual, fun atmosphere. Very relaxed atmosphere and service  in all ways and the guy we had was super nice and conversationAl. We got lucky and went on a beautiful day, so we were able to enjoy the big patio facing the lovely side street (mainland). Price point was fair for the good sized portions. And we got refills on our coffees on the regular throughout our brunch. My corn beef hash was amazing and flavourful, very mouth watering."}
{"text":"I've walked past this lovely patio several times and had mentally added this cafe on my list of places to go. Today I finally got that chance when the restaurant I had intended to go was closed. Blessing in disguise! Service was friendly and attentive, the patio was spacious and comfortable, and generally a nice spot to hang out for a leisurely meal amongst the flowers. The menu has all your basic breakfast dishes covered and a few quirky additions like the breakfast pizza and pulled pork eggs benny. My friend ordered the peameal bacon eggs benny (which she loved) and I had the bacon and poached eggs with wholemeal toast. The bacon was amazing, slightly thicker cut and not as crispy as what you'd normally get at say Cora's, and ohhh so tasty. The eggs were done perfectly, too. It supposedly comes with hash browns but what came instead resembled home fries. I double checked with the waiter and indeed they were the hash browns, oh well they were delicious! I know there are plenty of other cafes in the area I want to check out, but I will definitely be back here. Probably sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"The patio is great. The prices are ok. The staff are friendly and funny!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service. It was busy and understandably, the food took a little longer. The waitress was kind enough to acknowledge and check on us. Got the peameal eggs benny -- it was okay, nothing special, pretty standard here."}
{"text":"This place has the best brunch on a Sunday. The owners are super friendly, and are willing to accomodate special requests. Would definitely come here every weekend if I could!"}
{"text":"Great waiter, big smile, accommodating (Hi Benjamin!). Pretty festive atmosphere for a Christmas week, solid selection of beer, three ciders. Weird unpleasant smell, perhaps a waiter, perhaps the nearby restrooms. Positive environment. Will return."}
{"text":"Located on the corner of Church and Maitland Streets, Church St. Garage is a typical watering hole in Toronto's Church & Wellesley Village that caters to the Happy Hour crowd. Don't get me wrong, the joint also serves food, but when the weekend arrives and the Happy Hour is in full effect, this place gets packed with many characters.  Great during warm months when the patio is open and active.  Highly recommended for people watching and also just getting together with the boys."}
{"text":"Calamari, Fish and chips, steak sandwich, two ciders, $68 bucks before tip.  Fish and chips good, my boyfriend had so many tendons in his steak he knocked half his fries on the ground trying to cut through it.  You can do better than this place, move on."}
{"text":"Fish n' chips (w/ $5 upcharge for poutine) were probably the worst I've ever experienced, on both accounts.  Can't comment on the rest, and the vibe is alright but.. def don't get the fish n' chips or poutine lol."}
{"text":"Another church street restaurant with so much potential but unfortunately misses the mark completely. Great chicken salad but with stems still in the strawberries. Service is hit and miss here. The music turns 80's too early and the clientele is a bit trashy - hello church street.  Get it together people. More effort required."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow on a Saturday night when it was partially empty. The waitress was very friendly and nice about it but it still left much to be desired."}
{"text":"Where does one find a suitable breakfast/brunch spot with a patio, that also happens to be open for business on the Monday of a long weekend?  Well, Church Street Garage obviously.  We stopped in here this morning for some brunch and we were not disappointed, unlike the disappointment we felt after discovering that the spot we wanted to brunch at was closed...seemed to be an ongoing theme for us over the long weekend.  Anyway, after we were seated on the patio, our server was quick to bring us our coffee, mugs are huge by the way.  Coffee was good, and that's always a good sign.  I ordered the peameal bacon eggs benedict for $9 and my friend had the Garage Classique Breakfast (2 eggs, with home fries and bacon for $10).  Both were cooked perfectly.  The poached eggs delicious and the Hollandaise sauce rocked.  Now, I don't normally like home fries, however, I was pleasantly surprised at how good they were.  Probably the best home fries I've had in a long time.  I know that my dinning companion enjoyed her poached eggs, and commented specifically that they were cooked perfectly and that the bacon was 'awesome'.   I love patio, there are plenty of umbrellas if you prefer the shade and the tables are not jammed together so it's quite roomy.  The flower boxes along the outside of the patio are also a nice touch.  Will definitely be returning.  This place will be on my regular brunch rotation from now on!"}
{"text":"Great service. Awesome staff!!  Food is fantastic. Nice interior design.  Great new addition to the area!"}
{"text":"2 stars for the license plates on the walls... The natural window light. 8 dollars for a pint... Come on!??  Toronto sucks for drink costs, this place is a buck more than the expensive places."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks and food on Memorial Day weekend. We ordered poutine and Alexander Keith's beers. The poutine was pretty good. The AK was pretty light and watered down. It's similar to Bud Lite or Miller Lite. The waitress was friendly, but there weren't a lot of beer options. It has a nice patio for people watching. I might be back if the mood strikes."}
{"text":"Horrible! Too bad I had to give it a star!   First of all, I did the Yelp check in for a free soup and the waiter claimed that the owner and manager have never seen it before and cannot honor it, despite another yelper redeeming it 4 days ago! Fail!        Service is terrible. We waited 5 mins and when no one came, I had to go up to the bar and asked to be served. The food took 1/2 hour to come. We ordered chicken and waffles and a Brie and pear burger. Both were overpriced and awful. The waffles and chicken was $15. The waffles were cold and chicken was dry. The burger was $14, but there was hardly any Brie and it wasn't even melted on as the menu claimed it would be. The pear slices looked old and tasted flavourless. The presentation of the food was nice, but it was deceiving because it tasted awful.  Honestly, we contemplated just leaving throughout the wait for our food. My regret is that we didn't and ended up paying $35 for a painful meal.   The only thing that was good was the music and we sat right near the window and people watched.  By the way, the table was dirty and the washroom was smelly. There was a track of the last time someone cleaned the bathroom and that was on August 27th, 2 days ago. I guess washrooms don't need to be cleaned on weekends.  This place is a disgrace. Never been so disappointed. Let's hope I don't get diarrhea tonight!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good with a decent selection. Depending on when you go the service isn't the greatest. The last time I went on Nov. 8th, 2013, the service was terrible and me and my friends got verbally assaulted by some drunk old dude who felt the need to just come and sit down at our table. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I would have loved to given it a 5 but after last nights dinner disappointed a bit with the food and the \"Pride Menu\".  First stopped by for dinner on a Friday night and had Fish and Chips. The fish was amazing tasted like it came from England the batter was crisp and cooked perfectly. The fries however ehhhhh soggy and limp comes to mind Chef needs to cook them a little more but my fault for not sending them back.  Went there again for drinks and appz really enjoyed them had a salad which was extremely good dressing was homemade and delicious. Wife had the strawberry daqueris which were a hit as well.  Service - Excellent as always  Now went there yesterday the place was not that busy being the start of Pride however went there on Thursday around 6pm lots of Patio drinkers not many eaters I come to understand why.  Sat down given the revised menu for pride disappointed no fish and chips on the menu pretty basic food selections burgers, sausages,  fries etc etc. The wife and i order the Chicken Caesar wrap with Fries and i went for the Veggie burger.   Noticed that the staff were waiting around the kitchen a lot seemed to have a problem getting the food out in good time they weren't even that busy this is problem come peak time.  Finally food arrived after 30 mins my veggie burger disappointed looked more like a puck the burger was sloppy the crappy parts of the iceberg lettuce shoved in a bun with a shriveled slice of tomato and a little bit of onion topped with a handful of soggy fries again ;( Wifes food was ehhhh at best again the crappy part of the lettuce with a sliver of bacon filled with chicken that seemed to come out a box of Janes chicken breast pieces definitely did not look fresh and smothered in Renees sauce.   Overall horrible pride experience place is trying to squeeze customers by dishing out terrible food at record slow times. You would think businesses would use Pride as a way of winning customers round to becoming regulars not chasing them away.  Definitely not worth the $40 bucks including tip."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  Will not recommend unless you want to ruin your evening and get insulted by staff who can get violent for no reason and would not even apologise . From security staff to manager no one knows how to treat customers."}
{"text":"very disappointing meal. after waiting 45 minutes for my food it was terrible. The waiter was nice and kept coming up with excuses as to why I had to wait so long but in the end it wasn't woth the wait. I ordered the country fried chicken and couldn't eat the batter on they had put on the chicken. I scraped the batter off the first of 2 pieces and couldn't be bothered on the second. just ate my fries. even though I ate less than half of the food on my plate and I had to wait over 45 minuted for it they still charged me full price for it. It will be a long time before I go back there and won't recommend the place to anybody. It won't bother them as they will always get street traffic. Too bad. it could be a nice place. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the waiter was great.   Avoid this place if you like food."}
{"text":"We ordered eggs florentine and belgium waffles. The food was average but it was nice and warm on the patio. The service was decent."}
{"text":"There are lots of reasons why I love The Garage. Here's a few: 1. It has the best patio on the street, the only one that gets sun most of the day. Hopefully they'll get music on the patio this summer.  2. The new menu is great - good call on the recent changes. The pizzas (BBQ chicken), burgers and Summer Salad are all especially good. 3. Draft is always cold - love the frosted glasses. Perfect for the patio. 4. Seems to be a lot of new servers. I've had amazing experiences recently with them.  5. It's an all around good place to hangout - very relaxed. Good music and atmosphere.   Thanks to Fatima and TJ, the owners. It's obvious they care about their restaurant, the village and the food they serve."}
{"text":"I had wanted to try this place before it closed and re-opened as the Garage but never got a chance to - so I took advantage of the beautiful sunny Victoria Day Monday we had and went for lunch with my sister. We got the last table on the patio (I love this patio!!) and ordered a couple drinks. Sis had some crazy caesar with bacon in it (she figured she had to try it but apparently cold/wet bacon isn't great) I had a couple of pints.  We shared the mussells and greek salad - decent portions, the salad was delicious, the mussells a little less so, but not bad.  Service was good, especially considering the place was jammed.  Some things on the menu seemed a little on the pricey side, but the dishes I saw being delivered to other tables all looked great so I'm definitely willing to go back and try something new!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a dinner break for a bite with some coworkers.  Atmosphere and service were great, but the food was sub par for me.  The soup tasted like it came from a powder mix, and the $15 salad came with rock hard/burnt to a crisp chicken nuggets on top instead of tenders and was served in a small cereal bowl.  Probably the place for cocktails and patio, but think twice about the food."}
{"text":"We stumbled into the Church St. Garage to escape the snow - fortunately they had room for us, considering we had completely forgotten that it was Katy Perry concert night - err, the Superbowl.   They have a great sized menu and I couldn't believe the deals they had for Superbowl Night - a pound of wings and a pint for $10?? It doesn't get better than that!  UNFORTUNATELY, I'm trying to be healthy and wings weren't going to cut it. There was a lot to choose from but I gave into my cravings and went with the classic Caesar salad, and started with nachos for the table (uh, that's healthy, right?).   It was a super busy night and I'd definitely be interested in going back on a non-major sporting event night. Since we weren't interested in the game, the sound was a little overwhelming, but really what else could we expect for the big game. Our server told us that one of the kitchen staff had not shown up and so things were a bit slower than usual. They did a great job of keeping us aware of our food situation and the server was really great. She was also the only server on that night (seems like a bad call on such a big pub night, but she still did well!).   I could definitely see myself going back here and trying a pasta (lobster mac n' cheese anyone?) a sandwich, or really quite a few of the mains - it's a good looking menu!"}
{"text":"Great patio. Keeps the sun through the evening. Food is quite expensive for what you get and the service offered. Service is hit and miss. More miss. Beer on tap selection is very limited. They promote Bud, Bud light and Blue...go for the patio. Not much else."}
{"text":"Garage has the best patio on Church Street.  Service is fantastic. Great place to meet up for drinks   Quality of food is poor. Spoke to management but they don't understand what the problem is.  This in itself is the problem.    Won't eat there again until the menu and food quality improves.    Look across the street and the Firkin is packed. Look at the Garage and its empty"}
{"text":"Service is usually hit or miss and can be slow. You'll need to be patient or order at the bar for a quick beer."}
{"text":"This place was so overpriced! I got the veggie wrap and it was so much pita and so little veg. Ingredient quality wasn't great and portions are fairly small. The leaves in my salad were definitely browning. The staff is pretty friendly and the patio is nice but it was definitely not worth the value, wouldn't return for sure."}
{"text":"I came here after a beer festival so my memory of the bar is hazy. I remember getting a free soup with the Yelp deal, which was awesome. The drinks were tasty and the food was pretty good too. The staff accommodated our large group and were kind and courteous. I thought the waitress was hitting on me, but my girlfriend insists she was just doing her job. I left the waitress a nice tip for making me feel wanted, if only for a second. Tip: waitresses don't want to sleep with you. My girlfriend made me write that. She may be right, but can't a man dream?"}
