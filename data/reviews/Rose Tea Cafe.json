{"text":"Just had a horrible experience here Saturday night. I've gone here several times because the food is good but I'll never go back now. The place is sort of dirty and the tables are always sort of sticky and grimy. I could overlook that and come back because the fish with basil is so good. This past Saturday I took my girlfriend here for dinner. We ordered a few plates of food and after eating ordered bubble tea. We were talking quietly having a good time (still in the restaurant a total time of less than an hour) and the waitress comes over and says \"You need to leave. We need the table\". I was shocked! There were several open tables and not many people waiting. I wish I could have taken my 20% tip back. I thought they're shitty service was based on me being some white guy but after reading others I feel better knowing there is no race or gender discrimination in their shitty service. Won't come back and spread the word to several friends and family members."}
{"text":"Bubble tea is good enough, but the service is definitely a weakness. The guy on the counter was so rude with me and other customers."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and very quick too. I recommend the beef chow fun. The service is ok."}
{"text":"The main chef left the restaurant. He opened up caf√© 33 which is just around the block. The food at this place now has gone down hill a bit last couple times we were there the dishes were very salty."}
{"text":"Chicken curry. Absolutely awful, tasteless, waste of time and money.  Worst meal I've had in Squirrel Hill in 10 years. The chicken and vegetables (celery, onion, carrot) come in some kind of unidentifiable goo that has absolutely no flavor and  seems to suck any flavor the chicken and vegetables maybe once had right out of them. Not curry in any sense. Horrid."}
{"text":"Are you guys serious?  My meal at Rose Tea Cafe was the saltiest thing I've ever had, and I've eaten a big heaping bowl of salt.  Greasy, too... I felt sick after eating here.  My bubble tea nearly gave me a headache from all the sugar, and I usually love sweet things.

Maybe this is authentic, but it isn't good."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea in the burgh. I have bought green tea from here so many times, me and the manager are on a first name basis and she even gives me a little discount. Family run and family friendly, this place has the only good taiwanese in the area. Truly authentic taste and style. Love the staff and I know I will always be greeted by a friendly face. Their scallion pancakes and chunk chicken are amazing. 

Cindy Yen, you will always have a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"I didn't get what the big deal was with this place or why my exchange student roommate would go there several times a week. It's my fifth year coming here and I get it now! I took my fob friend who did the ordering for me and I had one of the best Pittsburgh meals yet. The braised pork which is frighteningly fatty and delicious wowed me as did the special crispy pork roll thing and the chunk chicken. Their menu is overwhelming and I probably would never have tried these items if it weren't for my friend.

Oh my braised pork. 
tl;dr Take your super asian friend and make them order the good stuff and you shall be rewarded."}
{"text":"I've spent one year living around this area while I was in CMU. Back into the time, Rose Tea was my daily restaurant and my favorite. It was my daily routine to grab a togo order while chatting with the waitress lady here and then rush for the bus to school. I've realized how important this restaurant is to me only when I left Pittsburgh and found Rose tea became a part of my memory of student life, of Pittsburgh and of my life. Sitting in the Rose Tea again, I've seen young students passed by and they are just like me in the past, busy but dedicated to the goal. Hope you guys all good luck on the way to your dream goal and hope Rose Tea long live and prosperous."}
{"text":"Favorite chicken and broccoli ever. I seriously crave it. The taro bubble tea is perfection. Portions are huge, great value."}
{"text":"Only reason I'm giving a star is due to the nice man serving. Food is awful, taste and looks like prison food; I know this bc I've seen every season of Oz."}
{"text":"Rose Tea cafe is one of the places my best friend and I stop at after getting our nails done and running around Walnut Street. The food and atmostphere is very comforting. I always feel like I'm visiting the home of a friend. A staple for me is the kimchi fried rice (SO GOOD!) coupled with a bubble tea."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to eat here. The main reason I was excited was I could try their stinky tofu. I had stinky tofu years (maybe decades) ago and couldn't take it. I wanted to give it another try. 

So my friends and I ordered a lot of food, about 5 appetizers (stinky tofu, taro cake, scallion and egg pancakes, and some others). All of the appetizers were great. I loved the scallion pancakes with the egg and beef. Good stuff! 

The stinky tofu was what I was waiting for. I decided to smell it again to see if it would reignite any memories. Nothing came forward, but it was stinky. I ate one and I could taste the stink. Not as strong as I thought it would be. Now my Taiwanese friends tell me that the Rose Tea Cafe's version is definitely not as strong as what is produced in Taiwan, and I think I'm very thankful for this. But overall I enjoyed it and would have it again and even try a stronger version of it.

Really good Mango smoothy. And their main entree dishes were just as good. At the end of the feeding frenzy, I was pushing the limits of my belt. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I'm definitely stopping by here."}
{"text":"WOW!!!  This place is great.  I went with a Taiwanese friend of mine and I smartly let him order for me.  He ordered what he termed \"standard\" fare but to me it was new and absolutely delicious.  I even tried the \"stinky\" tofu.  The smell was odd but once you got past it, the tofu was tasty and had a nice kick.  He ordered for me some braised pork with rice dish and OMG, it was like butter.  So tasty.  Large portions too.  Bubble tea was great also.  Again, tried something different (taro?) and wasn't disappointed.  You know the place is excellent because the place was packed and there were Chinese families waiting patiently to get in."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews, but this place left me with no choice. I ordered a large green tea slush with red bean paste and a beef scallion pancake, they charged me $13.05, I checked the Manu, the beef scallion pancake was 5.5, the drink doesn't have price tag. That's my last visit to this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in there last night for a pickup order for the first time in a few months- the restaurant wasn't too busy.  I ordered the eggplant basil w/tofu, shredded pork with bamboo (extra spicy), and chinese watercress.  The food was delicious as usual and not over sugared/oily.

Two things that struck out with me:

1. I was pressured to use cash- to the point that it was uncomfortable when I repeatedly told them I didn't have cash.

2. The prices have been rising over the past year.  For those 3 items, I paid $39+, which seems exorbitantly high for 2 vegetarian dishes and a pork/bamboo dish.  I could easily have walked down the block for cheaper and just-as-tasty food.  

I left feeling somewhat ripped off and disrespected.  But then again, the food is tasty so I guess it depends how much you're willing to pay.  Probably won't go there again in a long while."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place - I miss good Chinese (or Taiwanese, I grew up with it all) food!  I am not as impressed with this restaurant as other people seem to be, but that may be because my mother cooks better food.  It's just ok."}
{"text":"one of the best chinese/taiwanese restaurant  in Pittsburgh. bubble tea is also good"}
{"text":"I haven't been disappointed by this place, and I've been here a few times. The complaints people make seem to be about the service and the prices - I must be lucky in that the servers I've experienced have always been good ones, and I only order stuff that's reasonably priced! The portions are huge and the stuff is really good.

I wasn't a massive fan of the bubble tea, but that's more to do with personal taste than anything else. The little chewy bubbles just felt too 'weird'. The peach flavour of the tea was pretty nice though - maybe if I was a little more open to it I would've enjoyed it but I don't think I'll be ordering bubble tea again!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The pan fried noodles are delicious as well as the bubble tea. I recommend the tea coffee! Try parking in the lot on Shady if you cannot find street parking. (Behind Color Me Mine, etc.)"}
{"text":"BEWARE!
If you enjoy FOOD POISONING, then yes, of course I would recommend the Shit Tea Cafe. If you enjoy RUDE SERVICE, then yes, of course I would recommend the Shit Tea Cafe.  If you enjoy having THE RUNS for 24 hours, then by all mean, go to the Shit Tea Cafe! The culprit? Coconut bubble tea. I lay here bed ridden after indulging in bubble tea I had yesterday. I mean really.... don't go here"}
{"text":"As many have said, this restaurant easily serves the best authentic Taiwanese food in the Pittsburgh area. I have many Taiwanese friends who drive 2 hours from Ohio just to come here! The food is great, although not absolutely amazing. On the hand, the bubble tea is wonderful. Definitely some of the best I've ever had. Their smoothies are really delicious as well."}
{"text":"When it opened a while ago, we were there pretty often.
However, after a few months, most of my classmates stopped coming to this place.

Reasons:

1. The fried chicken and fried pork are very greasy, and because of the limited menu, you will soon get tired.

2. The attitude from the owner and the server is terrible. Once I ordered a takeout, but suddenly saw my friends dine-in, so I went sitting with my friends. Then the mid-age lady and the male server started yelling at me, as if I was going to cheat their tips. I was like, wtf? I have never seen any restaurant on Craig treating frequent customers like this.

Since then, I never come to this place.

Note that I saw another reviewer having exactly the same experience, so I am not the only one here."}
{"text":"The food is decent, I would strongly recommend the fried chicken, fried pork chop or eggplants. However, as other reviewers have mentioned, the service is quite rude."}
{"text":"I have to say some items are overpriced. The bubble tea is nice. The food is ok for me."}
{"text":"Going to Rose Tea Cafe, a few things are certain. One, the bubble tea will always be delicious. It is not one of those powder, artificial flavors mixtures that most other places serve. It is definitely one of the best bubble teas in the city. Another thing that is a definite is great food. You can never go wrong with authentic food. The lunch menu do wonders for us, college students. 

So, why just 3 stars? Well, one last thing that is always certain is... poor service. You can be sure, you will always have to wait forever to get a table. When you do a get a table, you will have to wait forever to get your order taken because they are understaffed. Due to the small space and lack of waiting space, you will have to endure others waiting for a table glaring down at you as you enjoy your food. Because every second you are spending in bliss with the delicious food, is another second others must wait. Adding on the servers trying to get you out as soon as possible, you will feel rush throughout the meal. Let's just say, If you looking for a place with smiles and bright faces, this is not the place to go. But you are willing to sacrifice all that for some delicious bubble tea and food, then this is place for you."}
{"text":"The bubble tea is so so. If you order anything with flavor it's going to come from powder. They're not great about mixing it so you might have little chunks of powder in your drink. The food is very good! I had the eggplant,crispy salt and pepper calamari."}
{"text":"Visited a few times. Decent food, simple clean premises, reasonable prices, but an agro boss who's throwing ur utensils at you at times; the older lady server seems nice, but at times too eager to collect payment before we can even finish our food."}
{"text":"Love their fried chicken drumstick over rice. Best choice for a take out. But if you dine in, they have lots of decent dishes to choose from. I was there yesterday with some friends. My last visit was quite some time back and so yesterday I was shocked at how the portion of each dish we ordered had shrinked! They used to serve you much bigger portion! Times are really bad! However, there's still quality in their food. Just not the service level. The employees are not exactly making you feel welcome at all. They just want to chase you out right after you finish eating.
Well I can't really blame them cos the place is quite small. I won't stay long right after I eat especially when I know there's ppl queuing for tables. 

Another thing I don't like their one rice per dish thingy. We are a group of 4 adults ordering 3 dishes plus an appetizer so we will only get 3 bowls of rice and have to pay extra for one more. Who sets this stupid rule??? It really got me offended when I first learnt about it. 

Yes, their 3cup chicken may be good, but now I've learnt to cook my own after I found a really good recipe from online. Will not be visiting this place often..."}
{"text":"This place is hard to beat for noodle and kimchee dishes.  Excellent milk teas, good smoothies, good prices.  Decent service, in and out quick as can be.  It's not a 5 for me because there's a lot of stuff on the menu that is highly authentic, and I have to admit to ordering several dishes at Rose Tea that I could not believe how much I did not like them.  So unless you really dig the down home asian cooking, stick to the noodle, rice, and kimchee dishes."}
{"text":"A locally run shop with home-style Taiwanese dishes you won't find elsewhere. The chunk chicken is a personal favorite, with stir fried bok choy or watercress for veggie, and the kumquat lime juice with pearls, yum!  The combo specials on the back of the menu are a great meal deal for students on a budget. :)"}
{"text":"Terrible food. Not even close to Taiwanese food at all. Smelly environment. Sticky tables and doors."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I moved to the Pitts from Chicago about 3 months ago.  I've already had 3 terrible experiences with 3 different so-called Chinese restaurants.  They all told me (a Chinese-Vietnamese person) that 'chow mein' means 'stir fried vegetables'.  Correct me if I'm wrong (and I know I'm not), but chow mein is usually stir-fried egg noodles with meat and veggies.  I think they try to cheat people here because there aren't that many Asians.  But I'm pretty sure that most non-Asians know the same thing.  Even if that is what it meant, all I got everytime was a plate of stir-fried onions with a scrap here and there of a veggie.  I almost gave up hope....

Then someone told me about Rose Tea Cafe.  Finally....a menu that didn't have the same ole sh*t that every other Chinese AMERICAN menu offered.  I was so excited, I ordered 4 dishes on my first trip.  I know...kinda crazy.  But I was not disappointed.  I especially enjoyed the house special stir-fried noodles.  I finally got my noodles. :)

The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because I have had better and more authentic Chinese/Taiwanese food before.  But for Pittsburgh, this is certainly as close as you will get.  I will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Note that this place is mis-categorized--it is a full-fledged restaurant.  While they do serve bubble tea (excellent bubble tea at that), they also have a full menu.

So for the food...Rose Tea does not serve Americanized Chinese food.  There is no General Tso's or any other foe Chinese dishes.  This is Taiwanese, home style.  Much the same that my friends eat when they go to Taiwan (so I've heard).  So, here is a list of things you should try:

Taiwanese Chunk Chicken (San bei ji).  Chunked chicken is a sauce made from garlic, basil, ginger, dried red peppers, soy sauce, rice wine, and sesame oil. 

Scallion Pancake with Egg..  Think of an omlette.  Yea, sounds weird, just try it.

Taiwanese Sausage.  Its just sliced sausage, with garlic (raw).  Try it.

Taiwanese sausage fried rice.  The above in fried rice, enough said.

Beef with Chinese hot pepper.  Be prepared for the fire, but this is an excellent dish.

Pork with Bean Sprouts and Shrimp (i think that's the name)

That should give you a good starting point.  The service is not perfect, but better than you should expect from most Asian establishments.  I am giving this a 5-star rating because this is the best Taiwanese food you can find in Pittsburgh (and anywhere, and I've tried a few outside of Pittsburgh)."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh!  Very tasty, reasonable price, generous portion size."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer of this restaurant. The first time my husband and I visited was in 2006. As we were so excited to find the only one place in Pittsburgh that sold boba tea we headed there immediately. After that first visit we went as often as 3-4 times a week!
The waiters/waitresses are friendly with you after you start interacting with them. You can tell they are not really sincere.

Our second visit to Rose Tea was not that pleasant. After paying we left forgetting to leave a tip. Right after we walked out the door, a waitress came out running behind us yelling you forgot to leave a tip! I was like \"OMG...are you serious?!\" Like you'd rush out to catch up to a customer for tips! I was embarrassed that I had forgotten but more shocked to learn that they'd something like that!

Comes to my surprise that I wasn't the only being chased for forgetting to leave a tip...

Food is \"ok\" but there is great rooms for improvement on service."}
{"text":"One of the two Asian restaurants that I come back often where the cuisine is not altered to fit everyone's taste buds. The atmosphere is small and quaint, and it gets pretty packed around eating times. But the food is served very quickly. If you want some really good Taiwainese food, then just check out this place: 

Dishes that I recommend: 

Beef w. Chinese Watercress in Black Pepper Sauce
House Special Stir Fried Rice Cake

Also, the mango smoothie bubble tea is the best at Rose Tea :)"}
{"text":"Totally will not go there again. The woman and the waiters are so rude. We came first and waited in the line, but the woman asked a white guy behind us to have a seat first. And the waiter lied when he saw his boss. What a Fxxk dogs and bxxxch!"}
{"text":"I ate here tonight with my friends. I got the mango smoothie, delicious, and the house special noodle stir fry. The meal was delicious too. The noodles were thin and had chicken, beef, shrimp. The portion was large. I took half of it home. Only negative is that menu doesn't have descriptions of items. Food came fast and service was good."}
{"text":"The delivery driver yelled at me and told me not to order again because it was too far. I'm only two miles away. What kind of way is that to run a business? Also the food was very bland and flavorless but the bubble tea was fine."}
{"text":"It's a shame that a neighborhood with so many restaurants is held hostage to this restaurant group.  Rose Tea Cafe in itself provides, poor, rushed service, rude management, and the food has consistently gone down hill.  The same problem is evident in their sister restaurants, Sun Penang and Ramen Bar.  Perhaps they should consider focusing on doing one restaurant well, instead of three poorly. Squirrel Hill deserves better!"}
{"text":"Love the chunk chicken. Great stinky tofu for being in the states. Boba tea is overpriced but it's pretty authentic. This place is awesome if you want some real authentic Taiwanese food."}
{"text":"I have not been to every place on this strip of Forbes but I highly recommend this one.  Noodles in broth with beef is the way to go.  Deceptively simple; hard to find done right.  This place has it.  Support it."}
{"text":"Food was good the variety of tea was great and the mango tea that had gummybears in it was sweet!!!"}
{"text":"Terrific hotpots.  The short rib is really really good.  Get a hot pot.  

Also bubble tea.  

The scallion pancakes are a must order as well.  

They go a little intense on the garlic and ginger, so make sure yo're in the mood for it.  Also, I'm not a huge fan of the squid hotpot.  The squid seemed a little questionable to me."}
{"text":"This place is technically called \"Rose Tea Express\" and they currently have a limited menu (most items include rice or noodles and some sort of meat either fried pork, fried chicken or marinated pork.)  Noodle soups are excellent, wide variety of bubble tea.  Some sit-down space as well as takeout.  Different than Rose Tea in Squirrel Hill but I look forward to seeing how they expand their menu."}
{"text":"Bubble tea wasn't tea! Colored water. Tasted terrible. Extremely disappointed! Not at all like the squirrel hill location. Avoid and go to the original! Not very friendly service either."}
{"text":"If they kept up their quality from when they first opened, I would give it five stars for the braised chicken over rice. It was SERIOUSLY delicious. I actually had rose tea three days in a row. Unfortunately it seems like this location is declining in service and quality. 

First Time:
Braised Chicken over Rice.
The sauce was not too sweet, not too oily, overall delicious.
The vegetable was something similar to cucumber and complemented it nicely.
Boiled egg, also good. :)

Service: vibe: You are there to get food, not to talk about your day with the people serving you. 
I won't take one side over another because frankly it's kind of an American thing to expect someone to chat, and since the food was great, I thought, wow, that was rushed, but boy that was good.

Fourth time onward:
Braised Chicken over Rice.
The sauce was hot, but the skin on the chicken felt (soggy?) Like the chicken itself wasn't freshly cooked. Not saying that it wasn't, just commenting on the actual taste.
Also, it's becoming increasingly oily.
The vegetables were store brand frozen vegetables.
Boiled egg, same as before.

Service: Previously I felt like they were conspicuous in trying to get customers out to make room for the next batch, which was fine.I understand efficiency and the mentality of this place, so I'm used to having every single detail of the order thought out before going up to the counter, as well as having cash ready. 

 But the new girl at the counter is rude to the point that it wears on the customers. 
Somehow though, the new girl at the cashier doesn't understand that while she doesn't owe customers a smile, the impatience she has gets old. 


Where does that leave us? 

Rose Tea would retain more regular customers if the quality was consistently good over time. Also, the aggressive service would benefit from a little organization/toning down. If the cashier doesn't like taking orders, that's fine. But she would probably be happier if she wasn't antagonizing everyone that walks through the front door.

At the moment however, I would say take your money to the Porch. Or Salem's Market on penn ave. Or even kai mei (though that's cantonese). Just until Rose Tea gets the message that they won't be popular as long as the experience and food are declining."}
{"text":"The fried chicken with rice is fabulous! It's interesting that it comes with an egg and some pork. It's worth the money and probably is better than the pork.

They only accept CASH."}
{"text":"Not crazy about the atmosphere, and I've never had the bubble tea, but I got hooked on the first lunch special (some sort of ground pork thing, with pickled greens and preserved egg over rice) years ago and I never manage to order anything else.  From tasting other people's food, I can also say that the chunk chicken is awesome (overpoweringly gingery and garlicky, but good), and the appetizer of Taiwanese sausage with sliced garlic is greasy but delicious.  The Taiwanese sausage fried rice is good too.  Still, I'll never give up that mixture of savory pork, vinegary greens, perfectly cooked rice and egg, and I'm not usually a menu-rut kind of person."}
{"text":"Pros: convenient and better bubble tea than its nearby competitors, Lulu's, Orient Express, and Little Asia.

Cons: cash only, limited menu and even more limited seating. Service is meh.

I go here pretty frequently to get a quick meal, but the restaurant is always packed due to its tiny seating area. Students are always crammed like sardines, waiting for their takeout. However, its pretty much the best fast-food option on Craig.

There are about 10 food items and a drink menu. Don't forget to bring cash or the employees will be visibly upset with you!"}
{"text":"This is a smaller version of the restaurant in Squirrel Hill; its menu is consolidated and consists mostly of appetizers and lunch combo-type items (as in, meat over rice dishes). They also sell some Chinese bakery items at the counter. There are about five tables that seat two or four people and a counter seating area, and the shop is bright and cutesy--cartoon tapioca pearls are painted on the wall, and your check is delivered in a little pail. The owner is brusque, which doesn't really match the decor, but the waiter is nice.

I usually only get black milk bubble tea here; it's the best I've found in the Oakland area. It has the perfect amount of sugar--not overwhelmingly sweetened--so there's actually tea flavor, and the bubbles have a good texture. They also offer it both cold and hot, though the hot costs a little extra.

I've also tried the taro cake (???). It wasn't bad--nicely pan-fried--but the taro flavor wasn't strong.

I plan on trying some of the entrees sometime. Bubble tea is discounted with the purchase of an entree!"}
{"text":"I went with my mom. They gave us water in little jars with a straw. We ordered three dishes with an order of dumplings. We got Chinese spinach (???), three cup chicken (???), and pork ribs (??). Everything was delicious and really hit the spot. I just wish the chicken was less greasy. There was plenty of food left over (it lasted me quite a few more meals). 

The service here was pretty good; the waitress was happy to recommend some dishes for us."}
{"text":"Rose Tea has a lot of good meals, but if I had to pick one, I'd recommend the Taiwanese Chunk Chicken as simply out of this world.  It's a pot of steaming chicken with garlic and ginger bits, and God knows what else.

As for bubble tea, I'm a huge fan of taro, and you can request this hot during the bitter Pittsburgh winter.  Almond is also good.

It can get pretty crowded in there, but waits generally don't take too long.  It's a medium sized restaurant, and tables tend to flip pretty fast."}
{"text":"I'm pretty conflicted on how to rate Rose Tea Cafe.  The food is quite good and they come out quickly.  In addition the hot bubble tea is the only one in Pittsburgh that I've found (and it's good).  

That said the service by the waitress is fairly terrible.  The waiter they have is fine but the waitress has a terrible attitude both times I've been there and the second time they weren't that busy either so I know it wasn't just a \"bad day\".  

Two star service + four star food."}
{"text":"Great for when I want to have a Taiwanese/Hong Kong style dish and they do have great bubble tea. I've had better food elsewhere, but it's great for Pittsburgh. Some of the dishes can be inconsistent in qualify from time to time. However, the restaurant is in a great location in Squirrel Hill, and it definitely fulfilled my cravings for Taiwanese/Chinese food when I did go there! :)"}
{"text":"My kids wanted to go here for dinner.  I can't believe that our family has just been here twice!  Maybe because parking is a challenge and I am famously a parallel parking moron?  Who knows.  I need to suck it up and get here more often.  Both meals we've had here were great and did not break the bank.

On our last visit:
- Kim Chi combination fried rice.  Totally craveable.  The Kim Chi's spicyness is distributed throughout the dish and it's a great flavor along with beef, pork, chicken and shrimp.  My favorite item on the menu.
- Papaya Milkshake.  Awesome.  This was for me.
- Mango Bubble Tea.  My daughters split it and they loved it.  I had a sip and loved it too.
- Curry Chicken Special.  For my wife, this was just the right amount of food for about $8.00.  A total college kid item at the price that came with steamed rice, veggies and a pickled egg.  Very Taiwanese!

Easy going atmosphere with very attentive service.  Great for groups and families with kids.  I need to branch out more on their menu because it is a huge one and the other dishes going out to the other tables were very enticing on my next visit!"}
{"text":"There are some real gems on the menu at Rose Tea, and some things that are hard to find elsewhere. Sometimes the service isn't awesome, sometimes it's quite good. The food is good and consistant, and the portions are well worth the price."}
{"text":"Good place for Taiwanese/Chinese food in Pittsburgh.  The only decent one I've found so far, comparable to what I'm used to eating in Cali.

A little pricey though, prepare to spend like $15 for a drink, some rice, and a standard dish.

When I really want some chinese food, I come here."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but since I have become a vegetarian, I feel like it's difficult to determine what foods I can eat here."}
{"text":"Being raised in a Taiwanese family in L.A., I have been tasted a lot of great Chinese as well as great Taiwanese food. That being said, Rose Tea Cafe is the best and most authentic Chinese food restaurant in Pittsburgh.

Rose Tea Cafe started out mostly as a Bubble Tea store then became serving hot food after a few years.  I really believe Rose Tea has hit a home run with their food.  They are about as authentic as one can get.  From squid soup with rice noodles (100% Taiwanese) to Chinese Meatballs to Chunk Chicken to Watercress, their menu has more variety than any Chinese menu in Pittsburgh.  It also doesn't offer any Americanized menu.  The taste is heavenly, reminding several some of my Chinese classmates of their mothers' home cooking.  Their best dish is the Chunk Chicken, or as Chinese call it, \"Three Cup Chicken\".  The chicken is cooked with basil and garlic.  Its chicken is never dry like several LA places would make them and the basil and garlic add a great flavor and fragrance to the dish.  Other favorites include shredded pork cooked with bean curd, Taiwanese sausage and Pork Intestine.  Not everything at Rose Tea is great.  For example, the Chinese Meatballs are not very chewy and the squid soup may taste bland at times.  By Pittsburgh (and East Coast) standards, however, they are still quite good.

It would be a crime if the bubble tea is not reviewed.  Opinions vary a lot here.  Many people like the taro and almond bubble tea.  Personally, I feel the tapioca pearls are very chewy and not as unchewable as Orient Express'.  However, its milk tea is not that good; milk feels absent from its taste.  Overall, their bubble tea is nothing special.  I really expected a lot from them in the bubble tea department since it is a Taiwanese drink.

Now onto prices, service and parking.  Overall, Rose Tea prices are very reasonable.  However its appetizers can be quite pricey and come in unnecessarily big portions.  For example, a plate of bean curds or seaweed costs nearly $6.  Lunch specials cost just about the same.  Service is quite averge.  Don't expect your American-fare service.  One particular waitress I've had regularly would also keep suggesting food after I specifically mentioned that I've ordered enough.   They also rarely smile.  Parking is not bad if you know where to park.  Street parking or parking in the lot across from the restaurant costs a few quarters.  There's free parking at Giant Eagle, which requires a little bit of walking.  But I repeat: one's free and one's not.

Bottom line
Pros: Good authentic food, great variety
Cons: Service"}
{"text":"Was walking by yesterday to eat lunch (elsewhere), and was thinking to myself, told ya so!!
Roaches and gross hygiene!  Here's links to the health department advisory, and notice they gave them SIX inspections before the consumer advisory.."}
{"text":"CMU students know to come here for closer-to-authentic-than-other-Pittsburgh-restaurants Taiwanese food. My favorite dish is the Taiwanese chunk chicken (\"san bei ji\" or three cups chicken literally for the recipe that is used to make the sauce).

My parents, who are from Taiwan, like this place.

The service is not always great... it's leaning on the practical side. Don't be surprised if you get asked to leave because you're lounging around for too long after finishing your meal. Although it seems it has been getting better lately. They are nicer to people they are familiar with.

There is a wide selection of bubble teas, etc. My favorite is the yogurt smoothie. The yogurt is of the Asian Yakult yogurt drink variety and not the creamy yogurt you may imagine.

They have some standard specials, which are kind of like fast food. One of these is a fried chicken and rice plate. This is a safe thing to get if you have never tried Taiwanese food."}
{"text":"Completely bizarre to me that these guys aren't at 5 stars.

I'm Taiwanese and can vouch for the authenticity of their food.  Stinky tofu might turn off non-Asians, but dishes like their Beef Noodle Soup are phenomenal and should be universally adored.

If you're looking for General Tso's, keep looking, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"The Service is very awful!!!! Today was the first time I went to here cause I saw they have Taiwanese food. So I walked in and I ordered a pork rice. The man in cashier got my card and everything is good until another guy asked me if for here or to go when I sat on a chair. I said for here. He asked me have you paid? I was like yes I did. Then I got my rice that is in the box for take out in a plastic bag. Then I just sat there and begin to eat. The guy suddenly asked me to sit in the bar seats. I didn't asked anything but it doesn't mean I was not pissed off. Then I heard they talked about that something like I should not eat in their store at this time either cause mine was in take out box or the afternoon is not the time that people eat inside the store. Okay! The point is I don't know your store's rule! Though it's a small store for people who live around there but I'm not the one who should know anything about it. The whole thing is just made me very uncomfortable. They just don't know how to do business."}
{"text":"Their bubble teas are specially served and have amazing taste! Authentic Taiwanese flavor and dishes. I love the chunk chicken and chicken legs over rice!"}
{"text":"This is my first time in Pittsburgh and it's pretty difficult for me to get out here. However, if my friends let me, I would eat the next few meals at this very same place. That's how good it is! 

The first thing I noticed when walking in are the cute jar cups! I've wanted one for the longest time and believe me I had to really remind myself of my morals to resist the temptation to slip one into my bag...Anyways the decor is neat and the interior is clean. The only complaint I have is the cold draft that would penetrate the room each time someone opened the door. Hence, we had to eat with our jackets on. 

The choices are many. At first I wanted to order taiwanese chunk chicken but I was too full to get it so I ordered from the cheaper menu. I got beef stew over rice. The beef was tender and came with many vegetables in the stew along with a side of pickled veggies. I really liked the pickled veggies. I then remembered that I hated beef stew but I ate it anyways. I think that it's a great dish for someone who likes beef stew to start with. All the dishes on the special menu come with soy browned egg. YUMMY! 

Another favorite was the scallion rolled pancake with beef inside. THAT WAS SOOOOOOO GOOOOOOD. 

The Chow Fen had a lot of vegetables and tasted rather clean. I've definitely tasted better on the streets of China, though may not be the healthiest. 

I ordered bubble tea because I've heard people rave about it. I ordered a mango black bubble tea. The tapioca was a bit small for my standards but the tea was not bad. Could have been better, but probably the best they have around PIttsburgh. 

For the price, the quality, and choices given, I would come back to this place if I had more time."}
{"text":"Never come again! The new cashier has the bullshit attitude. I would like to dine in but didn't see the sign on the table that told me to tell them first. So I forgot to tell her. After she knew that she shouted to me \" U NEED TO TELL ME FIRST!!! DO U KNOW?\" I told her I did not see the sign and she shouted that's your responsibility. DON'T come here otherwise u also gonna be shouted to eat."}
{"text":"Nothing very special. Had lunch and the service was pretty bad and food was edible. The place was small and cramped, and true to all chinese restaurants some mexicans were preparing the food \"not authentic at all\". Would think twice abt going back."}
{"text":"Honestly, every time I eat at Rose Tea Cafe, I'm happy. They give rather large portions and are really authentic as I heard from my Taiwanese friends. Though the prices are a bit steep, especially for bubble tea( back in NY you can get it for much cheaper). However, their bubble tea is probably the best in Pittsburgh, at least of all the ones I had so far."}
{"text":"Centrally located, the food is pretty good but I come here for one reason. BUBBLE TEA. Lot's of flavors and so far in the Burgh it's the best place to get it. Plus when the weather's nice you can take it to go and suck up those tapioca balls on Forbes Ave."}
{"text":"The food is good, portions are small if you're doing family style. If you're looking for a place that serves chicken balls in pineapple sauce, DON'T come here. I only say that, bec. there was a family at the next table to me complaining about their food to the waiter. There was nothing wrong w/ their food, but I think they thought it was going to be something else. 

One caveat. When someone says that Rose Tea Cafe has the best bubble tea in Pittsburgh, that doesn't mean much. If you like the bubble teas made from powdered mixes, you might like it. However, I prefer fresh fruit juice bubble teas, which no one in Pittsburgh seems to do."}
{"text":"Bubble tea tastes absolutely terrible. If the restaurant is crowded, they kick you out the moment you have finished your meal. Don't ever eat in. Only upside to this is that ordering their chicken option gives you two massive drumsticks, an egg, and a small side of vegetables, which I feel is pretty value for money."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them no stars because that's how the quality we received. I have been there a couple times and the food is ok but the service was non-existent the last time. 
We walked in asking for a table for 3, they said to wait even though there was a couple open tables. A group of five with no reservation showed up after us and was immediately seated, then a group of two showed up with no reservation and took the last table. I told the person seating everyone \"you do realize you just seated two groups after us?\", he replied with \"you're gonna have to wait 5-10 minutes\".
We left and went to a 'Bangkok specific' restaurant a block away instead where we were immediately seated AND were entertained by authentic Thai dances while our food was made.
I definitely recommend this 'Bangkok' place waaay over rose tea."}
{"text":"3.0/5 - Spare Ribs with Spicy Sauce: A bit oily, but very tender and well cooked."}
{"text":"These people have terrible service and don't know how to treat customers.  I am disgusted. They don't even deserve one star."}
{"text":"Pork dumplings with soy sauce is really good, perfect college comfort food. All of their entrees are juicy and filling."}
{"text":"Cann't wait to try"}
{"text":"There are few times that two restaurants with same name and style can have such a significant difference. Compared with the other Rosetea Cafe on Murry St, it's like a terrible brother. Taste is not good, service is also always not good. It might be the worst on this street."}
{"text":"Hands down, favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh and probably favorite Taiwanese restaurant ever!

I love almost every single dish they have on the dinner menu.  I would stay away from the fried rice and fried noodles, etc though.

The intestine dish is perfectly spiced, perfectly flavored and perfect for a cold night.  Their three cup chicken is unmatched anywhere else! 

Even their milk tea is fantastic!  Perfect blend of milk and tea flavor with tasty sweet chewy tapioca balls.  

The wait is pretty bad since so many people know how fantastic of a restaurant this is so come prepared or come during off peak hours.  The place is small too so I wouldn't come in too big of a group unless you want to wait even longer. 


Sigh, Rose Tea, how I miss thee..."}
{"text":"I read that the Chunk Chicken was awesome, well it wasn't.  $13 for a bowl of chicken???  Yes it came out in less than 5 minutes but there was nothing special about it.  For $13 you think that you would get more than a bowl of rice and $2 worth of chicken.  It was a bunch of semi over cooked chicken.  Nothing visually appealing and the taste, well, it was just OK.  I'll go back to try something else, but this was not the greatest of food everyone on yelp was applauding."}
{"text":"Visits: Once, for dinner.

Food: I had the smelly bean curd, the shredded beef with hot pepper, the shrimp with peas, and the seafood with bean curd in hot pot. I usually have a lot to say about food, because I love food and I love tasting things, even if they're bad. Somehow, I don't actually have much of an opinion of their food. I guess that means it was okay. Not bad. Not good. Just standard tasting, generic Chinese food. That's not necessarily a bad thing - it kinda came off as \"comfortable\", I guess. The only thing worth noting is that the food is kind of bland. The smelly bean curd wasn't actually very smelly, and there was a very chicken bouillon kind of flavor for everything, save for the shredded beef (which was just soy sauce and pepper flavored). One point off here for generically bland food.

Atmosphere: It was pretty average in this regard, too. Your standard small restaurant. Could stand to be a little cleaner. There was also some live entertainment in the form of an incredibly dramatic (and loud) outburst from some woman (a customer, I guess?) who stormed out with a kid in tow after screaming in Chinese that she never wanted to see someone again. I'm guessing that's not a regular feature, though.

Service: Average, like above.

Cost/Benefit: Honestly, for the prices they charge, they could make something that doesn't taste like what I'd make if I were lazy at home. One point off for charging around $9 for the smallest Wal-mart frozen cooked shrimp + frozen peas + boullion + corn starch. It tasted good, but really, guys?

Overall, I'd say the most impressive thing about this place is just how average it manages to be."}
{"text":"This place won't disappoint you! Everything I tried so far has been flavorful.

My favorites here: Vegetable Lo Mein and eggplant with garlic sauce.

Portions are huge, two entrees will be enough for three people."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Asian restaurants in Pittsburgh. Most of their dishes taste very good. At the beginning, I went there for chunk chicken. But now, i usually order fish filet with basil or seafood with basil. Chow fun and pan fried noodles taste so good as well."}
{"text":"This place is lame!!! We came on a Sunday night and all we wanted after a chilly walk was a tea. BUT, when we ordered the lady told us we couldn't buy just one tea \"five dollar minimum per person!\" Needless to say we walked out. Freaking dumbest thing I've ever heard!!!!"}
{"text":"type: taiwanese

suggestions
- garlic cucumber
- 3 cup chicken casserole
- spicy fish w/ tofu

special meals for $6"}
{"text":"Really delicious and authentic menu, their chicken soup for two is most comforting food out there, and their napa cabbage has the perfect amount of spice.  Generally  you can be in and out in about 45 mins even if you have to wait, so it's a great spot before movie or something.  I love their bubble tea too.  My only bone to pick with them is that they don't take credit cards for bubble tea/they have a minimum.  

Any place that has minimum or doesn't take cards automatically loses a star because firstly that's illegal and secondly it's a very simple service to provide your customer and not doing so hurts the overall experience for many."}
{"text":"First time here in Pittsburgh, gotta say, I am thoroughly impressed. Despite the unavailability of my all time favorites (Taiwanese oyster vermicelli and omelette), the flavors of the Egg Drop Tomato and Spinach Soup, the Cucumbers Mixed in Minced Garlic, the Taiwanese Tempura, the Stinky Tofu were all spot on! The service of the waitress here was very personable and kind. She took the time to explain to me in detail why they don't serve any oyster dishes (the oysters here are just too big in size compared to the ones in Taiwan). I ordered the Chicken Leg Over Rice as well, now patiently waiting (the four dishes I initially ordered arrived super fast in 5 minutes). Since I sit by the restaurant's entrance I also noticed customers walk out of here smiling lol Great job Rose Tea Cafe!!"}
{"text":"Love Rose Tea Cafe.

Came for the bubble teas, stayed for the food.

Menu is gigantic, like others said Taiwanese chunk chicken is great, also had a beef dish and an eggplant dish. All were very very good.

Also, best bubble teas in town."}
{"text":"Best boba tea I've had in a LONG time (green tea with milk), even though I get boba from NYC's Chinatown often. =)"}
{"text":"Very good chinese food. My favorite dish is the tofu+shrimp. Also, the only place in Pittsburgh with pudding flavoured bubble tea (it might be off the menu at this point). It's fairly expensive, but I haven't found it anywhere else and it used to be a fav of mine in Mountain View..."}
{"text":"Bad service and bubble tea. There are better options in the area. Try going across the street"}
{"text":"One of the few nice Chinese restaurants!"}
{"text":"besides being the only bubble tea place in Squirrel HIll, It is also some of the most authentic asian food you will find. YOu say \"but mike, you are white, what do you know about asian food\" Good question. NOTHING. I do read a lot of blogs and an asian gentleman did write a blog saying this is the most authentic chinese food he has had since his mom made it for him. I trust that guy and so should you."}
{"text":"Pathetic, to say the very least.  I wish I could give this restaurant 0 stars. 
The food was horrible. For $8, I was given absolute scum. My \"curry chicken with rice\" consisted of semi-frozen chicken with curry powder frozen on top. The service was even worse - my friend wanted to eat with me but she got a falafel from Ali Baba's. A server came up to us and told us to leave if she's eating food from outside because \"we have our own food and don't want other inferior restaurants' food coming here\". 

Please do not visit this shitty restaurant. There are better places you can spend your money."}
{"text":"Good Eats for Cheap! Best Kimchi in the burg. For a good meal in a awesome neighborhood stop in and take a seat. This place use to strictly serve drinks - so the bubble tea is very good. But the food is great too. 
Menu Fav: Chicken Kimchi/Eggplant and Chicken"}
{"text":"I have basically been living here for the past week. Its a convenient place to go when I have to stay on campus late and its close.

 I am a vegan and I absolutely love their eggplant dishes. They're simple, filling, and good. They also give you a lot of food for the price. Yes they do have a limited menu and its not like the one in squirrel hill, but I still really enjoy the food. 

They also have great bubble tea, much better than lulus. The only aspect that I dislike is their sauces. They overwhelm the dishes with sauce, drench it even.

 Overall, in a pinch I would come here for the best eggplant in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I visited Pittsburgh for the weekend and strangely had a craving for beef noodle soup. I guess it really shows that I can't go without soup and noodles for more than a few days. My buddy told me about Rose Tea Cafe in Squirrel Hill and so I checked it out.

It was my mid-afternoon snack, so I stuck with the beef noodle soup and a jasmine bubble tea. Both were surprisingly good. Being from Toronto, I am spoiled with high-quality Chinese food. Compared to my favorite Toronto restaurants, the dish was just average. However compared to where I am situated now, in Rochester, it was good.

$8.50 gets you a generous portion of soup and noodles. While other reviewers found the beef portions to be small, I thought otherwise (see attached pictures). There were 5-6 generously sized pieces. They were well-tenderized, but still slightly chewy. 

The broth was flavorful without being overly salty. However, it lacked spice and I was eager to get my hands on some hot sauce. I also thought the soup could be a bit more \"beefy\". 
The noodles were al dente and cooked well. It was served with suan cai (Chinese sauerkraut) and Chinese Kai-lan vegetables. The one vegetable that I missed from dish was Chinese Bok Cho. 

The bubble tea was good. The tapioca was not excessively chewy or hard. The ambiance and service were pretty average. If this place were in Toronto, I would give it a 3/5. But compared to Rochester, NY and most likely other places in Pittsburgh, I will give it a 4/5."}
{"text":"I would love to give Rose Tea Cafe a better rating, and if I were rating the food alone, it would certainly be a four or five... I love the food. The homestyle tofu is great, as is the pan-fried noodles. By far, my favorite dish is the scallion pancake with egg; amazing and soft and just the way I wish I could make them at home!

But the worst part is the attitude. Why do I always feel like I'm imposing on them whenever I go in? After being seriously and shamelessly bullied into paying in cash (I understand that credit cards are expensive for businesses, especially the small ones), I try to have cash with me whenever I go now. Still, I get dirty looks from the women behind the counter, from the servers, and from the cashier. 

Service is slow, which isn't a problem in its own right, but if it weren't for the fact that everyone else seems to get waited on very quickly and have speedy food preparation, I'd let it go.

I went recently with a friend of mine from out of town after raving about the food and she felt really uncomfortable, too. She said she felt like she was being stared at, she felt like the server was laughing at us (I speak some Chinese, but not enough it seems), and that he was really ungracious. I don't expect a red carpet reception, but if you could keep the xenophobic judgment off your faces until after I've paid the bill and left, that would be great. 

So if you don't mind being made to feel like an intruder, the food is good. But be prepared to pay in cash, or else face the death stare (if you're even allowed to pay that way)."}
{"text":"Best Three Cups Chicken (Taiwanese Chunk Chicken) and Beef Stew Noodle Soup in the city.  They also have stinky tofu! Though it could be quite a bit stinkier.  Protip:  get the hot bubble teas."}
{"text":"Pretty chill place with above average bubble tea, and food. With the overwhelming amount of students frequenting the establishment, you could probably tell the place is student friendly. 

Food was relatively inexpensive, and portions were good. 

Fun fact: the owners/servers speak mandarin/canto"}
{"text":"I ordered a hot classic boba and marinated pork. I was pleasantly surprised by the marinated pork. The location of the place is good to. There are neat shops nearby like the Caliban Book and the Carnegie Library and Museum are also near. I love Rose Tea Caf√© on both Craig and Forbes. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Decent food! I wouldn't come here expecting super authentic kick ass Chinese cuisine, but given what it is it's not bad. 
The portions are on the small side for their prices for the specialty dishes though. 

Food comes quickly. They fill up quickly during prime meal times, and it's a small place so get there quick."}
{"text":"Ok.  I loved it when I first started going, but now:  not so much.  My last two orders have included food prepared so poorly that I either didn't eat it at all or tossed it out after a couple of bites.  I'm just not into handing my money over to people who don't give a shit anymore."}
{"text":"good taste and original taiwanese flavor! Three Cup Chicken is definitely recommended. The size of each dish is a little bit larger than other Chinese Restaurant in Pittsburgh. So if a few friends go together it would be better so each get to taste different dishes :)"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????rose tea! Please try it! Authentic Taiwanese food! Try three sauces chicken! It won't let you down!?"}
{"text":"The stir fried rice cakes dish is my go-to but I tried the Shredded Beef with Green Peppers and it was literally fire in my mouth and later in my stomach. I'm usually good with spicy food but I was definitely challenged with this dish. I recommend ordering this with another dish to even out the spice levels and allow you to enjoy your meal without constantly drinking water to calm your palate. A recent favorite of mine is the Taiwanese Sausage Fried Rice! It's so good and it complements the Shredded Beef with Green Peppers really well. I wouldn't recommend the bubble tea here though because I think they use powder and you can taste it in the drink. 

Okay UPDATE on the Shredded Beef with Green Peppers. It's no longer extremely spicy... I think they might have changed it so that it is less spicy because when I got it recently it was not spicy at all and my friend who ordered it weeks after I did said the same thing.

Service is okay and the interior can be a bit dim."}
{"text":"Delicious. Comparable to LA and SF standards for Chinese food. Actually correction Taiwanese food.

The beef noodle soup had flavor and the beef was tender. No chewy beef here! The fried pork and rice was good as well. All the dishes were yummy! The beef onion cake rolls were a great appetizer!

Lack of one star goes to the drinks. Those can be better. The almond milk tea was powdery. I think if the girl was not on her phone so much it might have tasted better with some more effort.

I think Pittsburgh needs a Tapex or a Fantasia!!!"}
{"text":"Having just moved to Pittsburgh, I was apprehensive about trying \"Chinese\" food in a city where steel and blue collar worked reigned supreme for so many years.  However, I happened upon this little restaurant and heard from another Chinese guy that this place was actually decent.

I was surprised to find that they are actually a Taiwanese establishment.  So, going back to my younger days eating authentic Taiwanese food in socal, I decided on the Pork Chops with Rice.  When the food came, the plate contained 2 nicely fried pieces of Taiwanese-style pork chop that were actually really tasty - a  little hint of sweetness, well seasoned, and not dry.  A portion of rice, preserved vegetables, and a soy-sauce hard boiled egg topped it off. 

Also ordered the passion fruit tea with tapioca.  Pretty damn tasty.   AT $6.25 for the plate and another $2.50 for the drink, it was actually quite a deal.  

I've yet to try their black bean sauce noodle (which the waiter said was excellent), but for now I'm pretty surprised at how good the food was.  As a newly transplanted San Franciscan in Pittsburgh, I'm super hesitant to try any form of Asian food, but this dish was legit."}
{"text":"We ordered the eggplant with pork, green beans with shrimp, and the pan noodles with pork. We really enjoyed the combinations on the menu and would say that we would order from here again, the eggplant dish was a bit oily, the shrimp were over cooked, and the pan noodles were monotone. But we were pleased with the meat to vegetable ratios and had no complaints about flavor."}
{"text":"I am sad to say that I feel this place has gone down a bit.  I remember eating here for the first time a few years ago and I loved it - everything was so fresh and the prices were good.  They made simple dishes such as fried rice and lo mein stand out as they were fresh and flavorful.  This last visit left me feeling sad and disappointed.  We were the only people in the restaurant, yet we were sat next to a big wall of plastic (I think they are expanding) that had a freezing cold breeze blowing on my legs the entire meal.  We ordered a bubble drink and requested two flavors (strawberry/passion fruit) and was told \"No.  You can only have one flavor.\" After offering to pay extra for the second flavor, we were still told \"No.\"  We got scallion pancake with egg as an appetizer and I ordered egg drop soup in an attempt to warm myself up.  Both were good.  In fact, the scallion pancake with egg was probably the highlight of our meal.   We had the kids with us and got Pork Lo Mein, Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken Curry.  I couldn't even eat the chicken curry.  It did not taste good to me at all.  The lo mein was okay, it tasted very starchy to me, but the kids liked it. The fried rice tasted like it had been sitting for a while.  In closing, I hope this was just a fluke as it was during the Holiday Season.  It would be sad to see a place that I really loved go down the tubes."}
{"text":"Bubble-tea only review...
I'm an avid bubble tea drinker, and this place passes the test :).
Definitely in the top 5% I've ever tried...  Wow - you can even taste the tea!  I got to try their regular milk tea and the jasmine green milk tea - pleased with both.
In comparison, about 60% of the boba I have tried taste like straight up high-fructose corn syrup and ice...

Would like to go back for some of the most appetizing looking dishes I saw people chowing down, if I'm ever in the area again..."}
{"text":"I've been here in Pittsburgh for two weeks and finally found the time to try this place. First of all, I am Chinese and I live in LA, where there's no shortage of amazing authentic Chinese cuisine. Secondly, I brought my parents with, both very particular with their Chinese food. So needless to say, the bar was set very high. 

The restaurant itself is cut and cozy. We had to wait about 15 minutes, but the staff was very friendly and kept us posted. While we were waiting we looked at the menu, and it looked promising. It's a pretty expansive menu, most items looked authentic. 

We ordered:
-small intestine, tofu and sour cabbage soup
-eggplant with garlic sauce
-napa cabbage with dried shrimp
-beef noodle

I would say hands down the best dish was the eggplant. It's all in the sauce and the texture of the eggplant, both were spot on. Perfect amount of sour and sweet, i wanted to lick the plate clean afterwards. 

Everything else was equally delicious, we were all very impressed. 

I highly recommend this place to everyone. Don't just order a boba, try something new and different, you might surprise yourself."}
{"text":"Just no. I've seen these people throw customers out and throw their tips back at them. It doesn't matter how good the food is, no restaurant this unprofessional deserves customers."}
{"text":"I can only write this review based on their bubble tea, but it's one if not the best bubble tea I've had in Pittsburgh.

They get it right in all the flavors with my favorite being their milk coffee."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm surprised that this place is rated 2.5 stars. I would give it a 4 star. But I eat the same stuff every time...and it's pretty good, the marinated pork with rice I guess"}
{"text":"Had lunch here while visiting my buddy in Pittsburgh. Food is good and authentic but nothing spectacular to rave about. I love their extensive menu with all the Taiwanese dishes that i love growing up. Bubble tea here is awesome as i can tell the bubbles are not left overs from previous night on the few occasions i stopped by. Price is reasonable with pretty good portion. 

Only complaint i have is the staff. We got there 5mins before they open but they refuse to let us wait inside. Then the staff was a little reluctant at first but did warmed up eventually and got friendlier."}
{"text":"To stay consistent with the other reviews I have... this place is one of the three best places in Pittsburgh that I miss with all my heart. I went to school there, and Rose Tea has quite grown on me. Somehow it has wonderful and quite possibly the best Taiwanese food I've ever had. But this could be because I only really started digging Taiwanese a year or two ago.

I used to stick with the shredded beef with Chinese hot peppers because my Korean American friends used to tell me that it was the closest dish to Korean food, and I tend to agree. However, once I discovered the wondrous Taiwanese Chuck Chicken (\"San Bei Ji\") and the Taiwanese Meatball (in Chinese it said something like Lion's Head on the menu) the flame was on. There's something oddly addicting to Taiwanese food that sets itself apart from other Chinese cuisines. Cantonese has a splash of meaty, greasy flavor, Beijing is crisp and dry, Sichuan kicks you in the mouth with the spices, Guizhou is surprisingly refreshing and clean despite the full-scale flavor, and on and on... But Taiwanese cuisine has some common ingredient in it that this Americanized-but-still-broadly-appreciative-Korean-boy got hooked to. I have yet to figure that out yet.

Oh, and they have great bubble teas too. Almost forgot. I miss you Rose!"}
{"text":"The food isn't too bad but the service definitely worth only one star. The man in his middle age is impatient and almost looks angry most of the times"}
{"text":"Very delighted to find bubble tea in Pittsburgh AND DONG PO PORK!!! If you haven't had dong po pork, it's really fatty pork with sauce that is a regional food in China that I can never. They also had peanut milk tea, which I've never had before but was great, similar to my favorite flavor, sesame. The tapioca bubbles were also very delicious. My last gushing is about the Taiwanese sausage, which had great flavor.

My family didn't like the red bean milkshake or consistency of the milk tea (too thin) as much. They also prefer you pay with cash. Be careful of the stair, that doesn't look different from the floor, that separates the left and right side! Not a ton of seating either. Or soap in the bathroom."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Whenever I come back to town, I make it a priority to eat here.

This is one of the ony restaurants I've ever been to in the United States that serves such a large variety of Taiwanese specialties.  Outside of Taiwan, this is the best I've eaten.

I really like the special plates they serve that come with a choice of meat and then some rice, veggies, and a boiled egg.  Man, I love those eggs.
I also highly recommend the appetizers.  The Chinese style sausage with garlic and the crispy fried tofu are my favorites.

Overall, the food is excellent and the prices are very reasonable.  They also make some of the best bubble tea around."}
{"text":"Pretty good place, one of the few decent chinese food places in Pittsburgh.  Good bubble teas, a bit expensive though.  Can be crowded and is very cramped"}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food I have found in Pittsburgh. Conveniently located right on Forbes. Only complaint, no fried noodles with the egg-drop soup."}
{"text":"The food is good and pretty worth the money, but the bubble tea is nothing to shout home about."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spot in Pittsburgh serves authentic Taiwanese food if you know what to order.  They have a very reasonably priced lunch menu.  My favorite is the three cup chick (you can ask for fish instead as well, it's not on the menu) and fish in bean sauce."}
{"text":"Can't say I agree with the \"authentic\" claims that other people have made for this place.  While it has some of the more palatable Chinese food I've had in Pittsburgh so far, it was not a meal that I felt satisfied the unbearable ache I've been feeling in my stomach for good Chinese food that I've had since moving here from California.

For one thing, no authentic Taiwanese breakfast.  

For another thing, ma po tofu, in my recollection, involves not only tofu but also minced pork.  We got some tofu floating in a sea of thick sauce that was... not... ma po... tofu...

Curry over rice was pretty good.  Again, I'm not saying that place is bad.  But seriously folks.  This isn't authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"The best Taiwanese noodles in Pittsburgh ! Comfortable sitting and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"i was considering giving this place 3 stars b/c of how ridiculously overpriced i thought it was, especially for chinese food, but then i thought again about how there are no other options in pittsburgh for good taiwanese food so why wouldn't these greedy/cheap asian owners milk their restaurant for all that it's worth?? that's just good business sense. so the food isn't bad, just overpriced but since i don't live here i am ok w/ it since i can go elsewhere for my chinese-food fix."}
{"text":"If you want to try something here, try the short rib with peppers.  It is one of their best dish.  However, if you come here be prepared for shitty customer service.  

It took a while for us to get any service.  From ordering to asking for a box.  The waiter took his sweet time to take our orders even after us catching his attention.  Another employee came out to serve another table and saw I needed service but still didn't say anything to anyone else.  Why the hate?  I'm Asian too.  Aren't we suppose to stick together or something?

I wouldn't recommend their drinks.  They mainly use powder and artificial BS.  I tried their red bean milkshake and it came out blasting an hour later.

The family that owns this place owns several restaurant around the area.  The other places seems like a joy except for when you come here and the life drains out of you.

Try at your own risk."}
{"text":"The tofu basil was amazing. Pounds of wilted basil- the most i have  ever seen in one dish before. SOSOSOS GOOD.  I have not tired anything else, but that was worth coming back for."}
{"text":"** MORE LIKE 2.5 ** 

Definitely NOT great. More like a take out sort of deal. We decided to eat in and got charged 18% tip. How Asian. If it was a fancier/nicer/anything but Rose Tea Cafe, okay MAYBE 18%. But it's a run-down joint with a bar of 5 seats and two/three tables of 4 - why are you charging 18% ??

Also, the food is eh. Their fried chicken is literally fried chicken - nothing Asian about it at all and doesn't seem like they're trying very hard to emulate true Taiwanese food. 

In any other city, I dare say this place would have closed already. But it seems to be hanging on just fine, so keep doing you, Rose Tea. Clearly my expectations were too high."}
{"text":"I like this place as a fast lunch option, but the lady at the cashier is SO MEAN. She gets FRUSTRATED FOR NO REASON every time I order. If she's not happy about this job, she should go do something else rather than ruining people's day."}
{"text":"We had jasmin green tea with bubbles and it was refreshing. They originally wanted us to pay with cash but later accepted our credit card as we had no cash."}
{"text":"Tried different dishes over the years.  In general, they have been good.  One of a few good Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh area.  Price is reasonable for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I used to go here back when I went to Carnegie Mellon.  This is probably the best Taiwanese food I've had so far -- better than what I find in NY.  It's probably my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  

Restaurant / Service - Pretty casual restaurant.  Not that big at all and you can see them making bubble tea all the time at their bubble tea to go bar.  Sometimes it can be hard to get a table during lunch time or dinner time but if you go at 1pm or at 6pm vs. at 12 or 7pm then you're more likely to get a table. They are closed once a week so make sure to call em and see if they are open (usually it's a Monday or Tuesday that they are closed--kinda random but I know another chinese restaurant that does the same).  The service is pretty fast. You just go in, order and they bring it to you as quickly as possible.  

Food - AWESOME! The end.  hahah jk.  They have great lunch specials (6.25).  My favorites are the beef stew over rice, taiwanese fried chicken with sauteed pork and vegetables over rice with a boiled egg, taiwanese pork chop over rice and curry over rice (tastes like my dad's).  Everything's so well made there that you can't go wrong with anything really.  I once got kimchi chigae (korean @ a taiwanese rest?!) but it was really good and my friend Jay who's korean liked it as well.  Taiwanese chunk chicken, fried fish cake, dumplings, and salt n' pepper porkchops are also my staples here.  The bubble tea is also really good here.  I always get a bubble tea with my meal.  I think this place introduced me to bubble tea actually.  Wow special times.  

Price - Lunch specials 6.25?!  This is why I went here at least once a week back in college :) 

If you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh and craving asian food, go here and then if you want dessert afterwards, go to dozen cupcake shop around the corner :)"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times now, mainly because I was really excited about being close to a place that had good reviews and boba tea.  I've been disappointed each time I've given them business. 

Both times, the boba tea is just sad. Powdered mixes, hardly any boba, wayyyy expensive for the size of the drink, and it's usually mostly giant chunks of ice instead of beverage.  I have tried the green tea mint milk tea, and the peanut milk tea. Meh. I've had way better. I will have to find a different place to have my fix met. 

The servers seemed disinterested and unfriendly. When coming in, if you just want boba, go up to the counter.  They were a little dismissive when I asked for clarification on one of the other flavors. Informing me that most of their stuff was powdered mixes, which was a bummer to hear. 

The food, when we had it, were dinner specials. The food seemed overly salty, sad, and unauthentic.  

Unless this place completely changes the way it does boba, I won't be back."}
{"text":"The delivery was fine, and mostly correct besides a smoothie that was ordered with tapioca (of course at an additional charge) that came without tapioca. The rest of what I ordered was largely unimpressive. The pork rice noodle soup was bland, the seafood chow fun (that cost $8.95) had 2 pieces of shrimp, 2 mussels, 2 tiny fake scallop disks (I think? Definitely not a real fish product, whatever it was, and definitely not tasty) and about 4 or 5 pieces of unidentifiable faux-fish spirals that squeak when you bite into them (definitely not imitation krab, which I actually love). The chow fun was also very bland, not much flavor to be found in any of the items that were ordered besides the smoothie and egg roll. The smelling crispy tofu was very smelly, and very soggy. No complaints about the egg roll, it was your run of the mill egg roll, but everything else was very disappointing. The smoothie actually tasted really good, just disappointing that for $5.45, there was no tapioca. The last time I ordered from here, I also recall being thoroughly unimpressed but was craving a drink with tapioca so figured I'd try again, and that will be the last time I choose convenience of delivery vs this places uninspired, untasty, expensive (for what it is) food."}
{"text":"This is not a typical fast food American-Chinese place. If you treat it like one, you will be disappointed. Don't order those dishes. What this is, however, is homestyle Taiwanese Chinese cuisine. In fact, it's so homestyle that my friends who grew up in Taiwan found the place quite boring--\"This is basically what my mom would make.\"

For me, however, the food was wonderful. I love the Taiwanese Sausage, the shredded pancakes, the marinated beef. If you order something that's actually from the Taiwanese Chinese cuisine, I think you'll be impressed. Pay particular attention to the front page meal deals.

The \"cafe\" in the name comes from its origins--it was originally just a small cafe that served bubble tea and some random Taiwanese snacks. Several years ago they renovated and turned into a tiny restaurant. The decor improved dramatically and I do enjoy sitting there to eat. Their bubble tea is still some of the best in Pittsburgh, so be sure to give that a try."}
{"text":"Having been in Pittsburgh for 4 years of college, I can honestly say this place has the best Chinese/Taiwanese food around in the greater Pittsburgh area and handsdown top 10 I've had.

I frequented the place regularly and the dishes and bubble tea are both top notch while being reasonably priced. 

Just about anything on the menu tastes great and there are even some delicacies like pig intestines for the more adventurous people.

definitely make a trip to Squirrel Hill if you want good Chinese food!"}
{"text":"I have ordered red bean bubble milk tea. It is great, not too sweat, but the bubble is not as good as the fuke tea."}
{"text":"Food here was terrible. The eggplant and short rib hot pot was super tough and fatty. The pork, cabbage noodle soup was very bland and tried eating the leftovers were inedible. The server was friendly but inattentive and we had to ask several time for water. Also, didn't tell us until after she opened the wine bottle that there was a 5 dollar corkage fee. Overall: Would not recommend this place at all!"}
{"text":"great specials.  portion size is large.  also, if you order a special, you get like a buck off your bubbletea.  They have an extensive selection of bubbletea; and they happen to have my favorite: almond milk tea."}
{"text":"Wow - the mediocrity here is impressive! I got the marinated pork on rice. This is not a pork chop, rather, its chopped pork - bummer. Also, so, so much MSG and oil, I'm drinking a lot of water with this one. Feeling huge. The food left a lot to be desired.

Here's the thing - Rose Tea, since you are what, the 4th Asian restaurant within 100m (Little Asia,. Lulu, Oriental Express), you need to do things different and better. I've heard the boba is good - awesome there. But why would I decide to go there for a meal? I'll probably try the chicken, which my friends like, but other than that, I don't have a compelling reason to return."}
{"text":"Decent but nothing spectacular about this mom and pop restaurant that serves Taiwanese style cafe food. The menu is a little bit too long for my liking, but it does provide a wide selection of everything (you can even get stinky tofu here). Every time I come here I just stare blankly at the menu and then get a headache though.

The dishes here are okay. Pretty decent comfort food to me. The best thing about this restaurant is the fact that you cant get this type of food anywhere else"}
{"text":"Went to the Rose Tea Cafe for some bubble tea and a bite with my fella and had a great experience! 

We both thoroughly enjoyed our bubble tea (I recommend the coconut black milk - yum!) and the food was FANTASTIC. We started with the marinated egg and scallion egg pancakes which were good (and quickly devoured by my egg-loving other half) then he had the Taiwanese chunk chicken and I got the black pepper chicken with broccoli. They were both delicious!

I recommend this joint for a quick, reasonably-priced and tasty meal!"}
{"text":"It's so hard to decide what to rate Rose Tea. I want to give them 3.5 stars but I can't. So until Yelp fixes this feature, I guess I'll round down to three stars.
 
Here are the reasons I want to rate Rose Tea four (or sometimes five stars):
-Best bubble tea I've had in Pittsburgh. Hands down the most options and all have been great. My favorite is the passion fruit green tea.
-Good service. The people are usually polite and fast (for both takeout and dine-in).
-To-go orders are always right. 
-Food can be really good. 

The reason I want to rate Rose Tea three stars (and sometimes less):
-Food is not consistent and can be disappointing. This is my main concern about Rose Tea. I usually order one of two dishes and they have delicious, inedible, and everything in between. My boyfriend has not had the same kind of experience with the dishes he typically orders, but he had tried mine and agrees that they are inconsistent."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Rose Tea Cafe once (when I first moved here) and haven't been back here for the food, but have come back several times for the boba. It's not the best bubble tea I have had, but it is the best I have found in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times -- my husband really likes it but for me, I have yet to order an entree that I would order again.  There are only titles on the menu, no descriptions so you kind of have to guess what's in the dish from the titile and sometimes it is just wrong.  I do like the scallion pancake with egg appetizer but the noodle soup that I had the last time we were there was not good at all.  Very bland and with an overabundance of white, wide over-cooked noodles.  I think I'm giving up on the entrees.  If we go again, I'll stick to the scallion pancake and bubble tea."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's a small hole in the wall type restaurant but they always put out amazing food. Love the rice noodles, chicken with hot peppers, lo mein, chunk chicken, and bubble tea. Best bubble tea in the area."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place!  I went here on a weeknight at nine, an hour before closing, and the place only had a few customers in it.  The staff was nice while we looked over the menu.

I ordered the Chicken Fried Rice, and I thought the portion was massive!  We also ordered the Sweet and Sour Pork, which came with white rice, and was also a decent sized meal.  Both were delicious.  For me, this is the best Asian cuisine I've had in Pittsburgh.  Not super greasy, it felt very authentic.

The inside is pretty basic, but pleasant.

Next time I'm there, I definitely plan on trying the bubble tea and some other item off the menu."}
{"text":"Coming here for a quick ketchup flavored pork is actually good. I love ketchup but doesn't deviate much from the flavor. I personally enjoy it because it is quick and I dont have to cook but I wouldnt say it's above and beyond amazing"}
{"text":"I love their salt and pepper squid! And their Pan fried noodle and mapo tofu! Their bubble tea is great because I dont like sugar in my tea and make it like that and I add wheat germ."}
{"text":"Sometimes I just get a hankerin for some three cup chicken (or in this case, Taiwanese Chopped Chicken.\"  ugh it's so good, and then I end up eating it all in one sitting and having remorse.  But this isn't about my personal problems.

Rose Tea is great.  The service is friendly and fast.  The only thing that gives me pause is they claim to sometimes have a $15 credit card limit, and will kind of pressure you to get cash.  However, I've found if you're 'close enough' to $15, they'll let it slide."}
{"text":"Dumplings were burnt, beef chow fun had great chunks of veggies but was tasteless, however the spring rolls were fantastic."}
{"text":"Extremely unprofessional. Two of the workers (a woman who was setting the schedule and a man, who is a manager of some of the branch) were arguing extremely loudly about the man's schedule. It went on the whole time we were there. The man was gesturing angrily at the woman."}
{"text":"Best home style Taiwanese food I have found in Pittsburgh (and perhaps the only).

Homey and comforting atmosphere- usually easy to find a table for two. Water and bubble tea are served in cute mason jars. My favorite is the almond milk tea, hands down!

Vegetarians- definetly have options here. I enjoy the home style tofu, the eggplant with garlic sauce (best in the city), and the saut√©ed green beans the best. For an appetizer I love the scallion pancake with egg.

Service is efficient tho sometimes can be poor. We once had the poor old chinese waiter dump all our leftovers instead of bagging them. So try to communicate clearly. This is a dash and eat type of place. Also great for take out."}
{"text":"Authentic Taiwanese cuisine. Fast. Friendly. The BEST Bubble tea in town (and I should know). We try to experience something new each time we come. Today we tried House Stir Fry with rice cakes. Interesting and good. We have honestly tried at least half the menu. The only item we didn't like was the Smelly tofu. Otherwise, Taiwanese chunk chicken, pan fired noidles, sauteed green beans, Chinese pepper and beef, fried bean curd and beef....all delicious. Oh, did I mention they have bubble tea???"}
{"text":"As for the Bubble Teas-there is no place better! And trust me, I've been trying to find places all over the US-but, no one can beat Rose Tea!

As for the food-everything we've tried we love. Good portions. Good spices. Good selections. Authentic!

I am there A LOT!! I see many familiar faces when I'm there-and that says a lot for a restaurant. Everyone I've taken there for the first time loves it too!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in Squirrel Hill.  Really good, seemingly authentic Chinese food.  Not the typical General Tso's Chicken, but lots of interesting, fresh dishes.  Prices are reasonable.  Don't forget to order some sweet milk tea, with or without tapioca bubbles."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that the Rose Tea location in Squirrel Hill is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh and is consistently good.

Although I was excited when Rose Tea Express opened on Craig Street, I have not been nearly as impressed as with the other location. The food quality seems lower - I may be imagining things, but dishes have seemed greasy and have come with too much sauce. Additionally, the menu is a small subset of the menu at the other location, and is unfortunately missing most of my favorite dishes.

I hold out hope that this will improve, but for now the small menu and subpar food as compared with the other location makes this a solid meh."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've been to in the Pittsburgh area. Friendly service, nice atmosphere, excellent food, and reasonable prices. Their chicken noodle soup is hands down the best I've ever had (great when you have a cold!), and the shrimp lo mein is to die for. Rose Tea also has a huge selection of bubble tea drinks which have been (mostly) to my liking."}
{"text":"Decent Taiwanese food, we ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce and shredded pork with dried bean curd. The staff are friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Strangely the best Fried Chicken in the city. Not to be expected at a Taiwanese place. The appetizers are good as well. Not of the charts but for $9 to $13 a dish it's really impressive."}
{"text":"Great authentic Taiwanese food, nice bubble tea, minus one point for hard to find parking and the place is usually very packed during dinner. Good for small groups!"}
{"text":"Excellent bubble tea. Good service, and very good food. I have tried all the bubble tea places in the area, and Rose Tea is the best. Very authentic Taiwanese cuisine."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place a lot & it's always packed with Asians (a good sign if you like really good food). Slid in on Memorial Day for a quick lunch & had the beef scallion pancake, fried dumplings & a lemon tapioca smoothie. There was only one server there taking care of everything (host, server, & busser) & she was very attentive, polite, patient, & helpful to a newbie like me. Smoothie came quickly followed by food & all were excellent. Scallions & dumplings were crisp & delicious, & drinking lemon tapioca ice through a big straw is a very cool experience. It was a small meal & I left feeling not thoroughly satisfied but vowed to return.

A week later, I ordered 3 vegetable spring rolls, spicy short ribs w/ rice & a kiwi smoothie, & this time left with a belly about to burst. Spring rolls were fresh & hot (but not too hot) & just hit the spot. Ribs, I abandoned the chopsticks with, & ate them like I was at KFC #FingerLickinGood, & I experienced brain freeze on my Kiwi ice. 

I haven't been back since but will never forget the experience."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but selection is limited and not as plentiful as that of its main hub in Squirrel Hill. From the dishes that I sampled, including the friend pork chops and fish over rice, the dishes tend to lean toward the more oily side with definite traces of MSG. To be honest, I'm still surprised that it's still in soft opening mode seeing as it's been open for quite some time now ... which really puzzles me. Frequently busy especially during weekdays in the afternoons/early evenings due to its nearby proximity to Pitt and CMU campus so it may take a while to receive takeout orders if you go that route instead of sitting in. While they offer bubble tea, it really quite lacks the consistency that great bubble tea has and the bubbles in general are a hit or miss, either just right or more so than not, way too hard."}
{"text":"I've never been a worse restaurant before. My gf and I went there for dinner last night. After we entered, there wasn't a person who welcome us until we stood for more than 15 min. The service in Rose Tea Cafe is horrible. It seems that they don't care about their customers at all. I strongly don't recommand Rose Tea. If you don't wana waste your money and get unhappy there, keep away from it."}
{"text":"I usually go there when I want a bowl of hot Beef noodle soup. The beef noodle soup is not the best I have had in Pittsburgh but it is cheap (compared to other places) and the portion is huge, perfect for winter or when I am feeling a little homesick. I would recommend adding a little bit of chili oil (ask the waiter to get you some) to the broth, it really enhances the flavor. 

The service is ok sometimes, depending on which waiter you get. 

They do also have some appetizers that are very commonly seen in Taiwan like the cucumber dish, marinated seaweeds and so on. All the appetizers are decent.  I have ordered some Entrees other than beef noodles on the menu before, but most of them are a little oily and just meh for me."}
{"text":"Powdered milk tea..  Had the almond milk tea here... Not bad... Make sure you've got some cash on hand. Might try the food here some time."}
{"text":"Pretty popular place for good Taiwanese food and boba. The food is cheap relative to other similar restaurants and the service is generally really fast. Definitely my favorite spot on Craig street."}
{"text":"Much smaller than the Rose Tea Cafe in Squirrel Hill, this place has a much more limited menu. There's a small selection of appetizers and entrees (mostly rice and noodle soups).

This place is more of a drink counter to order bubble teas, green or black teas, smoothies or milk shakes.

The passionfruit green tea was good. Just sweet enough."}
{"text":"Pretty good Taiwanese Cafe, especially for Pittsburgh!
(I think this place could do reasonably well in NYC too!)

I had a milk black tea with boba, the milk tea was pretty good, though a bit too sweet. The boba was a great consistency, soft, chewy, and just right. (They use the smaller medium sized boba here.)

The braised intestines in a spicy sauce were good. I loved the texture of the intestines, the big pieces, and there were plenty of them. The sauce was okay enough, not great, but there were plenty of ingredients - pickled mustard greens chopped up, soft tofu etc.

The stinky tofu was mildly stinky, and a good deep fried texture. The picked vegetables it came with could use some work, as could the sauce under the tofu, otherwise the tofu was too dry by itself.

It's good to see other Asians in here eating too.

I would come back here to try the extensive menu if I was in Pittsburgh - alot of Chinese dishes on the menu (some Taiwanese dishes) and choices of teas, milk teas, and cold drinks.

Try it!"}
{"text":"Boba (aka Bubble Tea (aka Tapioca)) is fantastic here.

Back in California, we have a boba chain called Tea Station and Ten Ren's.  Theirs is the best I've ever tasted and Rose Tea Cafe is comparable.  

Their Green Milk Tea (or jasmine milk tea in other places) was the perfect hint of tea.  The consistency was not too thin or thick.  Their actual tapioca balls... I don't recall whether they were exceptional but they weren't bad.  

The food is pretty good and comes in healthy portions.

Now, the BAD...  the wait is absolutely ridiculous.  If you come around dinnertime- 6p or 7p, you really have to wait an hour for two people.  It's also a very narrow room so the waitresses are constantly tripping around people waiting by the door.

I just advise that you come around 8 or 9p or a lot earlier in the day."}
{"text":"I like the chicken noodle soup for $7.95. Bubble tea whoop whoop (but pricey and lots of ice). For Pittsburgh it's good and worth trying if you haven't had Taiwanese."}
{"text":"The food has gotten better over the years, but the service remains one of the rudest in the city. For some reason, the people who work here could care less about their customers, and it shows. The food is decent, but there are other just as solid choices when it comes to Asian food not just in Pittsburgh, but in Squirrel Hill as well."}
{"text":"Easy access bubble tea from CMU's campus, but the environment is not good for eating. The food is alright. Nothing I've had there has been at all notable."}
{"text":"The food here is okay, not bad. Boba tea is average, I've had much better in California :(. Their service is terrible, especially when you order take-out.  The waiters/servers who give you your order is so rude!"}
{"text":"Great variety of drink and price is great too. Parking can be a problem and u need to look for street parking. I order braised pork rice and found there is a lot of bamboo shoot mix together. Is not my favorite bamboo shot but some people my love it. Overall is fast and serve quick"}
{"text":"After months of waiting, Rose Tea Express on Craig is finally open! 
I'm quite impressed by the competitive price, huge portion size of meat, and convenient location. The Taiwanese drinks here is of the same quality as at original Squirrel Hill location.
The meal menu is very limited now; there's are only a dozen of foods to choose from, including appetizers. But I've heard that they do plan to expand the menu.
Also note there's no way to find a seat at meal time, so be prepared to order meal to go or wait for 15 minutes in a tiny space with a bunch of people."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The beef and spicy peppers, the Jerk chicken, and the chicken and broccoli with black pepper sauce were delicious. Service was faster than average for food of this quality. Around 10 minutes after we placed our order, we were enjoying our meals. I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I used to just come in for the bubble tea years ago because I remember this place is so small and always seem so crowded.. or maybe it was the time of the day that my friends and I always come in. Now I tend to go to RTC for a quick bite/late dinner kinda thing 

We always order their salt and pepper shrimp (YUMMY), chunk chicken, sweet & sour pork chop here is pretty decent as well. Do try their bubble tea as well it's actually better than some places I've tried. Don't expect anything like you'll find in NY, VA or Cali but for Pittsburghers, it's pretty decent"}
{"text":"excellent selection of boba drinks, better than I've gotten from random joints in San Francisco, and yet here it is in Pittsburgh

the Royal Ruby is delicious!"}
{"text":"We always get bubble tea from here! We walk from chinese school on certain days. Their bubbles are very good. I approve !
I usually get the passion fruit green tea or the black milk tea 

We've been here several times to eat, all times have been great! 

I also get takeout every once in awhile before I have to go to rehearsals 
I usually get 
Bubble tea
String beans and chicken (pretty American choice, but it's good!!!)

Their Chinese menu is very authentic. But they also have an Americanized menu
We usually get : 
H√© fen
Shi ji dou (string beans)
Ma po dou fu"}
{"text":"We can't stop going back to Rose Tea Cafe! The service is great and love the feel of the cafe setting. I religiously order a spring roll and chicken lo mein. It is the best I have ever had and nothing else compares to it! The prices are amazing for the portion sizes you receive!"}
{"text":"I love rose tea cafe in squirrel hill so I had high expectations when this place opened up. However, considering how limited the space and menu is, I find this one to be disappointing. 
I do like their salty crispy chicken, but the quality is not consistent: sometimes it's great but sometimes it's dry and not very flavorful. Their bubble tea is not as good as I Tea Cafe's. As for entries, the fried chick thigh with rice and another noodle dish were decent. Oh and their egg rolls are good.
But that's really about it. It's a place for you to grab some quick bites. If you wanna enjoy some well-prepared dish my suggestion is to go to the one in squirrel hill (that one doesn't have salty crispy chicken tho)."}
{"text":"Filthy.  Sticky tables.  Dirty walls.  Dirty glasses. Lots of bugs. Delicious food. Delicious"}
{"text":"We order take out from here frequently.  I am obsessed with their food. I order something different almost every time and I love it every time! 

Some highlights?  Kimchi fried rice, Chicken rice noodle soup, pot roast soup

But seriously, anything you order, you can't go wrong.  Now I want to go there again just writing about it."}
{"text":"Rose Tea does Taiwanese food very, very well.

FYI, Taiwanese cuisine is different from typical Chinese cuisine in that it tends to be milder and lighter with some Japanese influence (there are exceptions, of course, such as beef noodle soup).  So Rose Tea is a perfect alternative if you're tired of greasy Chinese food drowning in sauce, but don't come in expecting classic Taiwanese dishes to be bursting with a gazillion different flavors and spices.  You may even find it bland or boring, but then you'd probably be the type who mixes all the flavors and toppings at Razzy Fresh and enjoys Panda Express.  For me, though, Rose Tea hits the spot.

The place is always cramped and service tends to be rushed and impersonal, but it doesn't really detract from enjoying a casual meal."}
{"text":"I love the Rose Tea Cafe! I was a little leery about trying this place because some of the reviews were not the greatest but I decided to go for it. I got the pan friend shrimp and it was amazing!! The food seemed so authentic and nothing like I've ever tried before. My dad has tried almost everything on the specials menu and goes back once a week. I will definitely be going back to try more"}
{"text":"I'm very impatient when it comes to ordering food and ordering at Rose Tea Cafe was no exception. I mean, it was the only reason I overlooked an entire page of great lunch deals and ordered dinner entrees instead. 

But I digress. Bottomline: RTC delivers lip smackin' good Taiwanese cooking. 

The Taiwanese chunk chicken was solid in taste and in presentation. Though it was saltier than the version I'm used to in Columbus, it was delicious nonetheless (although skimpier on portion size.) The salt and pepper fish was unique in its own ways -- the most notable being the absence of peppercorn, which boded well. It wasn't until I was perusing the extensive bubble tea menu that I saw the lunch specials along with the accompanying bubble tea specials. The pork chop over rice sounded promising and tasted just as good as the previous two entrees. The pork chop itself was fried to the right amount of crisp, and the rice itself could have easily made for a meal as it was the infamous Taiwanese braised pork rice.

A good way of ending a meal here -- especially on days when scalding temperatures are reached -- is with a bubble tea. The lychee with extra jelly did the trick for me.

As for service, every server and employee were polite and courteous. No encounters with any surly owners were had."}
{"text":"The food was Ok. But the service was poor and ugly. The women cashier and server are bitches. Will not go there again."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here! Delicious eggplant dishes, especially the eggplant basil. Lunch deals are the best on Forbes hand down. 

Also the Boba teas are delicious."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this place for quite a while now. This is THE place for bubble tea.  No comparison. I always come here for their famous chunk chicken or their fried chicken cutlet. Rose tea offers quick service BUT they tend to squeeze customers into their tiny spaces. If you're unlucky enough, you get seated in the hallway right next to their bathroom entrance and the kitchen. I just wish they would extend their place just a little bit..."}
{"text":"Lunch for two. We Ordered egg pancakes for appetizer, and then stir fried bamboo sprouts with pork & sour kraut with pig intestines (yeah yeah I eat everything). The food was mediocre at best. Pig intestines can be yummy if done right, but this was not the situation. It just tasted salty. If you have never try it, don't try it here. You are not going to be impressed. The bamboo sprouts dish was slightly better. Egg pancake was dry. We also had bubble tea, which was the best of the meal actually. If you order them hot, they'll serve them with a mug and a tea pot for you to pour the tea yourself. That was pretty interesting."}
{"text":"Rose Tea is the go-to place if you're craving authentic Chinese/Taiwanese food in Pittsburgh. The prices are ok, the menu is extensive, and the service is good. The bubble tea/smoothie selection is excellent! You haven't experienced Rose Tea if you haven't had one of their bubble teas!

I've never had anything bad here, but they do have their cheaper options on the front of their menu. They have certain meals for $6.25, plus a discount on your bubbly tea if you choose to get one with the meal."}
{"text":"Excellent food most of the time.  I would come here fairly often during undergrad, once I realized LuLu's was not that great.  

Really, you should go here for the bubble tea which is quite tasty. I am a fan of the dumpling, pan fried noodles, and braised pork.  The other reviewers are correct in saying it is not as good as it was, but it is still decent."}
{"text":"The food is below average and tea is also not that great. What's even worse is service from this particular lady who is rude. I asked \"can you make hot tea as hot as possible?\" And cashier lady got pissed off saying \"it's already hot. How can i make it hotter?\" 
I asked this because last couple of times the \"hot\" tea was lukewarm. They use stove to heat it up and i simply wanted them to make it hotter. 
I guess it's too much to ask for hot tea to be hot."}
{"text":"I wouldn't give this place 4 stars if I just went once or twice, but since my friends and I go here every so often since it's nearby, I have to give it 4 stars. The bubble tea is just okay - I prefer to get it elsewhere. I've gotten lavender bubble tea before and it sort of tastes soapy. 

We usually get pork & baby bamboo shoots, eggplant with garlic sauce, short ribs with black pepper, kimchi fried rice, or seafood rice cakes. I would say that their food is pretty greasy/oily and sometimes I feel like I just ate a huge tub of oil, but the flavor is always on point. For the occasional Asian meal, this place is great."}
{"text":"Jack Dawson was planning to make Rose Tea. But then he froze to death and it never transpired. Still it was a nice idea. And this idea was finally brought to fruition by the owners of this Bubble Tea and Taiwanese Food place in the heart of posh, fancy, adorable Squirrel Hill in the hoity toity part of Pittsburgh - one of the most underrated cities in America.

What to get: Chunk Chicken is omg good, Bubble Tea is excellent (but very sweet), especially the Passionate Temptation special with Lychee Jelly.
What else: There's another kind of Passionate Temptation here, but only when I'm inside.

I get rather excited in the nether regions when I come here, hence the name \"Grows Tea Cafe.\"

So in terms of food, my favourite is what they recommended to me the first time. It's slightly pricey, a huge portion and very filling, but their Chunk Chicken is a Taiwanese specialty, juicy and moist (ahem), steaming hot and full of delicious flavour. I highly recommend anyone that likes Asian dishes and enjoys trying new things, give this one a try. It's as good as the Chunk Chickens I've had in NYC, and that is a very high compliment.

They always talk me into ordering things I don't want. I shrug and give in. Which is why I call it \"I Suppose Tea Cafe.\"

Even better, perhaps, are their astounding selections of inventive bubble teas. The Milk Teas are good, the Fruity Teas are great, but perhaps best of all are their magnificent specials, including the Blue one (I forgot what it's called, but it's very blue and very good), and my favourite - the Passionate Temptation, which I get pretty much every time I come here. I didn't enjoy it as much the last time, perhaps because I'd already had too much Bubble Tea for one day, and it is rather sweet. You could, I suppose, order it with less sweetness. But the little Passion Fruit seeds inside really take it over the edge. And if you get it with Lychee Jelly instead of bubbles, it's even sexier.

If the music is being played too loud, that'll be because it's known as BOSE Tea Cafe.

Service is hit or miss. The woman is okay, a little abrupt. The guy is quiet. Some of the other employees can be lacking in customer service. But then some of the employees are super helpful, like the awesome girl who helped me pick out my order the first time I came here. I've been here many times since and will visit mostly every time I come to Pitt, including last week when I grabbed myself another Passionate Temptation, and yes I mean the drink.

If your order smells bad, then it's better to call it Nose Tea Cafe.

Having had so many great Bubble Teas now, it's not at the very top of the list, but RTC easily earns 5 stars. The other location in Oakland is not as good, and even less friendly, so my advice is to stick to this one.

And this review is so long, the place should be renamed Prose Tea Cafe."}
{"text":"I used to visit Rose Tea a whole lot when I was in college, and when I came back to visit Pittsburgh it was nice to get my fix of Taiwanese food.  The bubble teas here are great - the tapioca is consistently good, and the flavors are great.  I would usually get a basic fruit tea here, but they have a bunch of fancy ones too.

My favorite dish here is the Taiwanese Chunk Chicken, which is chicken with basil, peppers and other spices.  I ordered it on my visit and it was just as good as before - the seasoning was great, the chicken was tender, and the portion was even larger than I remembered.  Other dishes I would recommend are the Eggplant (with basil or garlic), the House Special Stir Fried Rice Cakes, and the Beef and Chinese Watercress with Sa-Cha sauce (though that last one can be pricey).  The meal specials (on the back page) aren't bad either, and come with a decent amount of food for the price.

It was great to visit here again, and I would strongly recommend Rose Tea to anyone looking for good Taiwanese, or bubble tea."}
{"text":"Quite dissatisfied. My fianc√©e and I were looking to get some good bubble tea after a long day of looking At wedding venues. When we got there, we asked the waitress if we could do any flavor milk tea. The waitress said yes, so we ordered. However when our drinks came out, it was obvious it wasn't milk tea. We asked the owner about it and said it wasn't doable. The waitress flat out misled us, nor did the owner seem to care. I ended up paying for us, and that was that. Quite a shame. The place could have potential, but with that kind of service? No thanks."}
{"text":"I just ordered lunch from here and found some insect inside it when i was eating. It's really gross...."}
{"text":"The daily specials are good, but my favorite is the Kim Chi fried rice.  It's much better if you request it with less salt.  The bubble tea selection is without equal in the area.  They have one with a mix of black tea and coffee.  Delicious...who would have thought?  haha

The seating is like that of a nice quick-service eatery: clean, crowded and comfy.  It's not ideal for large groups."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a lunch and the food is very authentic! I would recommend the rice with pork chop and their Taiwanese style dishes. The Passion Fruit bubble tea would be a good choice to go along. 

Great place, great food, and good price - a 5 star for me!"}
{"text":"The only quality Chinese food I've been able to find in Squirrell Hill - they lose a star only for not delivering (which is perhaps unfair since not a lot of places here do), but it's worth it to pick up a to-go order."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh for what it is.  There are others which seem more authentic and popular with people who are Chinese (e.g., Tasty restaurant on S. Highland), and others yet which are super upscale (Richard Chen's in Eastside --also off of S. Highland).   This place has a great chicken with green chili peppers and a number of other dishes.  The bubble teas are also wonderful.   A couple of dishes are kind of goofy, like a chinese version of chicken fried chicken steak.  I am not sure if this is actually a modified authentic recipe or a pander to American palates in the worst possible way.  In any case the chili chicken makes up for most transgressions."}
{"text":"So I got a spring roll, a mango bubble tea, dumplings, and marinated pork over bed of rice. 

Spring roll was good, oddly small from previous I've ate. 
Mango bubble tea was amongst the best I've ever had. 
Dumplings, steamed, also great but oddly small with little filling or the few that had none. 
Marinated pork was awful. I ended up throwing the entire dish away, which was about $10. I tried 1 bite and had no idea what protein substance was in it. Definitely tasted more like beef. Whatever it was marinated in was awful. Had random vegetables like corn and lettuce which I would assume the corn was from a can and the lettuce was passed ripe. I wouldn't say the place was awful, I just think the food needs more of a touch up"}
{"text":"A OK extension of Ros√© Tea at squirrel hill. I had asked people at squirrel hill what this new express place would be like before it even opened and I guess it brought my expectations down a bit to begin with. This place has a limited menu, most likely cash only, and has very limited seating. Price is ok for the most part, favors are passable on the two dishes that I've tried. It's meant to be a grab n go kind of place and that's about it. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place a mediocre review but...here's why.

I used to love this place.  My parents, straight from asia, love this place.  In fact, every time they come to visit, the request we go here.  Pamela's for pancakes, and Rose Tea for dinner.  

It had great Taiwanese/chinese dishes, very authentic, very delicious.  Probably one of the BEST chinese food places in Pgh.  Clean, happy, bright restaurant, with friendly staff.  Oh so slightly expensive for chinese food (most dishes are $10+) but a) its family style so you all share, and b) its way better food than the little shack around the corner.

However, in the past few times I've come, its been...different.  I don't know if its because it's gotten so busy, or if it's changed ownership, or whatnot, the food hasn't been as amazing as it's been before.  Frequently, we get told \"Oh that's run out.\" Um...you ran out of cucumbers at 6pm?  Really?
The food hasn't been as hot, or flavorful, and I found myself more often then not disappointed at the meal. 

So, it's definitely still my go-to place for chinese food in the burgh, but...it's not as amazing as it once was."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of bubble tea. I had the black tea and milk, it was over ice. I like iced versions of bubble tea much better than frozen versions. My cousin got a mango bubble tea which was nice and sweet and also over ice. I liked mine so much, I got a second one to go. 

The menu was a little overwhelming. If you are unfamiliar with more authentic thai food, then much of the menu will not make any sense to you. The meals are listed in one line with the name and protein of what the dish it. There is no description to what you are about to order, so it's a little bit of a gamble. 

I ordered chicken over pan-fried noodles. It was very good. The sauce it was in was very tasty, the meat, veggies, and noodles were all cooked very well. Again I wish the menu gave better clues as to the contents of the dishes, and I would have ventured a little further out of the safe zone. 

I would love to go again, but it would be nice to take someone who knows the food so I can get a better recommendation. If nothing else, I will fill up on bubble tea."}
{"text":"Is it just me or is portion size now smaller at Rose Tea? I paid $9 for the he-fun noodles to go and was expecting it for both lunch and leftover for dinner, instead I got an incredibly small portion that left me feel ripped off.   The food is decent but it is not deserving of the four stars that everyone seem to give."}
{"text":"I really love the cafe bar, especially for the friend chicken set!!! It's both yum and worthwhile! And I've also tried the special dish from my hometown, it does not go too far, fairly good!!"}
{"text":"I have stopped in Rose Tea Cafe a few times, all for takeout.  While the interior is fairly small, they do a mean takeout.  I don't think the wait time has ever been more than ten minutes for takeout, which is awesome.

The bubble tea is pretty good, although once I ordered the strawberry milkshake ($3.50), which is just strawberry milk.  It was too sweet and fake tasting for me.  The shrimp lo mein ($8.50) is pretty good and makes 1.5 meals.  They use the cute little shrimp too, which I like.  I am more inclined to head to Everyday Noodles for my noodle needs, though.  

My biggest complaint is that I have tried to get lunch here twice at 11:30, and the doors are locked but the staff is inside.  Their door says that they open at 11.  This issue has stopped me from returning recently."}
{"text":"What make it great

Good service
Awesome people
Good beef dish

What make it bad

Sticky table and door knob( maybe just too old)
The shrimp dish wasn't good
Soup wasn't good either"}
{"text":"Yes. Doing Taiwanese food justice in Pittsburgh. It was pretty delicious and I would say that the food is very shareable. In fact, I feel like it should be mandatory! I joke, but really, the portions are generous without the food lacking in flavor. The food isn't heavy at all and I would say it's seasoned quite well. The downfall of a lot of Taiwanese food places is when the food tastes heavy and just makes you want to sleep right afterwards.

I would have to say that this place is busy almost all the time, but hopefully you are willing to wait for it because it's definitely a place I would go more than once. The boba is pretty good for Pittsburgh and I would say if you do want to try boba, you should get it here."}
{"text":"As someone who had been to the Squirrel Hill location of the same name a few times I was excited to hear one closer to my campus was opening up. They have a much smaller menu than the other location though, and seem to be more catered towards selling bubble tea. I have come here to eat a few times. The service is like your average Chinese restaurant, they take your order, bring you your food, and bring the bill and nothing extra, but personally I have never cared much about anything beyond the basics of service.

The food here is pretty good, although options are rather limited. I have had the noodles with a pork chop and noodles with chicken and they were both decent. My favorite dish here is the salt and pepper chicken. It's more expensive for the amount you get than the nearby Orient Express but is slightly better in quality. You have to pay extra for the rice to eat it with. I've also had the scallion pancake with egg which is also decent but probably not enough for a meal, but good to get if you come with friends and aren't that hungry. Not the best option for Taiwanese food around, but decent and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I think this place has it easy cause there's little/no competition at all to compare it to in Pittsburgh. With that said, the boba is decent, and the food is pretty good.. one of the few places you can get good Taiwanese food.

In Pitt, it's probably one of the best for what it is. Compared to other cities (LA, NY, etc), it's only average. Thus minus 1 star"}
{"text":"This place is very convenient for having a quick dinner or lunch! I love their noodles, but one disadvantage of this place is that they do not have lots of vegetables for most dishes :-/ the bubble tea is not good as that in Rose tea cafe in squirrel hill. It's not easy to find a seat here also."}
{"text":"service was fast, direct, and efficient.  Great options for bubble tea and a large food menu that can be intimidating.  Chunk Chicken, Beef and hot peppers, and sausage fried rice were all very good.  Beef was SPICY!!!!!! 
Can't wait to come back and try something new.....Fried chicken looked popular and delish."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were both very impressed with the meat entrees we ordered. I had the fried chicken which was perfectly crispy and flavorful and my boyfriend said the same about his porkchops. The service was great and I loved my Jasmine bubble tea!

My one disappointment is the sides that are served with the meals. The mixed vegetables they serve are clearly either frozen or from a can. The rice was ok, but again, nothing special. If this place stepped up their sides, it would make such a difference!!"}
{"text":"Came here to try the super Taiwanesey dishes, since it seems to be Pittsburgh's longest-standing Taiwanese joint, and was not disappointed!  In the winter, I want nothing but comforting soups and stews, so the BEEF STEW NOODLE SOUP definitely hit the spot.  The super flavorful, rich broth was satisfyingly beefy without being greasy, and the noodles were, as the Taiwanese would say very \"Q\"--that is, wonderfully al dente and chewy.  We asked--the noodles aren't made in house, but purchased fresh from a carefully selected vendor.  The water spinach in the soup was a nice touch, as was the pickled mustard--if I had a least favorite component, it was the beef.  Although perfectly tender, it had given up the majority of its flavor to the soup.  It would be great if Rose Tea would offer other versions of this Taiwanese staple, with tendon or offal...maybe someday, Pittsburgh.  Either way though, the dish was lovely, and my Los Angeles-derived friend of Cantonese heritage (2 distinct meccas of Taiwanese cuisine) approved as well.
BNS Score: 3.5/5

The other regional staple we sampled, the TAIWANESE CHUNK CHICKEN, or 3 Cup Chicken, was satisfying as well--super flavorful and not overpowered by the basil, though the chicken was diced a bit small for my discriminating eye.  My SO went with the SHREDDED BEEF WITH CHINESE HOT PEPPER--a nice home style flavor that reminded me of my dad's Tu Dou Si (stir-fried shredded potatoes with hot peppers, a Chinese staple).  Not crazy exciting though, I'll steer him towards something else next time, as he found himself lusting after my soup. ;)

While our party of 5 had our taste buds delighted by the meal, the service was much to be desired.  Our lacto-vegetarian Indian friend ordered the KIMCHI FRIED RICE veg-style to serve his culinary restrictions but forgot to mention he does not eat egg.  When the dish came and we sent it back, the owner harshly berated him, saying it was his fault he hadn't mentioned it and that he should have spoken up earlier.  ...While this might have been technically correct, I'll let you be the judge of whether it was kosher of her to yell, over a dish that likely costs cents to make in an empty restaurant, at a customer who doesn't frequent Chinese eateries and wouldn't know any better that a standard fried rice dish basically always includes egg.  They remade his dish, but while our jovial group didn't let the experience ruin our meal, I can't say this didn't ding my perception of this experience, which otherwise would have been wholly positive.  It is my hope that someday, Chinese restaurants can transcend the often very apt stereotype of delicious food but terrible service."}
{"text":"I've had nearly everything on their menu. I don't find their food that great, nevertheless I've been here hundreds of times because it's close to my workplace and they serve food fast. Their bubble teas are nice. 

They have fairly big portions, but the good is greasy. I end up getting their braised chicken over rice, which comes with two large pieces of chicken, and egg, and some rice. Their fish fillet over rice is also among the nicer dishes. I try to avoid their pork dishes since I don't think they are of very good quality. I ended up having tummy issues after eating those twice. 

They have some of the rudest service I have ever seen. I have seen their cashiers and servers change over time, but the one things that hasn't changed is their attitude."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place in Pittsburgh to find boba.  And to top if off, the food is incredible.  It's a little on the pricey side, but I feel like it's worth it.  I haven't left dissatisfied.  Their lunch specials are really good so if you can go during the day, it's a deal.  The place is super tiny and seems to get pretty crowded almost every night for dinner, so go early and don't go in huge groups.  The service is really fast and everyone is friendly...probably my favorite place in the burgh to get Taiwanese/Chinese food."}
{"text":"Cute little Taiwanese place in Squirrel Hill, Rose Tea Cafe offers bubble tea plus some great authentic Taiwanese fare."}
{"text":"I love this place. At first, I would have to agree that the waitress is, not really rude, but...I think there is just a culture gap. There are things on the menu that are very authentic, that most General Tso chowing American's would probably turn their nose up at. When a Sicilian-Welsh white girl walks in and orders salt and pepper shrimp, they lean close and whisper, \"you know they are whole right? Still have eyes?\"
Yes. I know. It's cool. 
I think we get a little spoiled, and forget that different cultures are just that: different. That doesn't make them rude. That's all I'm going to say. Take that as you like it. I've never been treated badly here, but it is different. It took the waitress awhile to warm up to me, but she now greets me with a smile, and even makes small talk. 

The food is great. The shredded beef with chinese hot pepper will ruin your life but it is soooooo delicious. The salt and pepper anything is great. Think sea salt and cracked pepper potato chip. I've had the shrimp, squid, and fish this way and it's all good. Ask for a few lemon wedges, it cuts through the salty taste (it IS called sea salt and pepper...whatever...it's supposed to be salty. Very salty.) And, speaking of squid, they nail it. It is always perfectly tender and never overcooked. The squid with basil is amazing. The seafood noodle soup is another favorite of mine. The lunch specials, which I believe are served until 3pm, (maybe 2pm?) are generous and delicious. I don't know what the marinated egg is marinated in but it was served hot, and it was killer. The fried pork cutlet is delicious too, and 2 of them with a marinated egg and side of veggies for 6.95 is a fantastic deal. 

And the bubble tea? Forget going anywhere else. Best boba in the city to be sure. 

Check it out with an open mind and remember it's a very small place. Take it for what it's worth. You come in to eat, not to hang out. Get in and get out. There isn't exactly ambiance ya' know? And don't go too far off the map food-wise if you aren't familiar with the more authentic dishes or if you aren't an adventurous eater. Just because you got brave and didn't like what you tried doesn't make it bad food."}
{"text":"A great option for authentic Taiwanese food in Pittsburgh. I've come here several times for the past few years since moving here for college. I'm a big fan of their Shredded Pork with Baby Bamboo Shoots, Kimchi Fried Rice, Eggplant with Garlic Sauce, Curry Beef over Rice, and their Green Tea with Milk! Their special meals (ex. Curry Beef over Rice) are a great deal if you're a bubble tea fanatic like me and would like a special drink alongside your meal. In my opinion, their bubble milk tea is the best in the Pittsburgh region. However if you're looking for a richer, milkier milk tea you might like Everyday Noodle better. 

The only qualms I have for Rose Tea Cafe is that on busy days the staff can get quite frazzled and act in a rushed, brash manner. However, I've had good service most of the times that I have been. My favorite waiter is the lovely old man who works there. He always makes me smile!"}
{"text":"A tad pricy, average portions, but it's the best chinese food I've had in the states of Pennsylvania and Michigan"}
{"text":"I keep coming back to this place.  Taiwanese cuisine. The tastes are fantastic and I find myself eating smaller portions because the food is so satisfying. The staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is casual but charming. I recommend the salt and pepper squid."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 4 years and it is my favorite Taiwanese restaurant. I would go as far to say it's the most authentic Taiwanese cuisine around this area.

The environment is slightly crowded, and it can get a bit hectic during peak hours but the food is worth the wait. My favorite dishes are the shredded beef with hot peppers, the chunk chicken, scallion pancakes with beef, and the beef noodle soup.

Some of the noodle dishes can be a bit oily and sometimes the portion sizes can be a little bit off. 

Overall, a solid place to eat if you can't decide where to eat."}
{"text":"Just a disclaimer: I have only been here once for the food, and I'm not an expert on Taiwanese cuisine by any means. I'll have to try again and update!

So for some reason, I have a lot of Taiwanese friends, and I found myself eating at the only Taiwanese restaurant in State College quite often when I went to Penn State. Rose Tea Cafe, for me, didn't exactly measure up to that. I know I'm super lame, but I wish they had more noodle-based dishes, so that was a little disappointing for me. I ended up ordering the spicy short ribs. I really, really loved the sauce on them, a little sweet almost like a General Tso's but spicier and and the portion size was huge! However, when I think short ribs, I think of tender meat and delicious, soft fat. These were rather tough and the fat was chewy and inedible. But like I said, the sauce was amazing, so I'm definitely going to give this place another shot. All the weird things like intestines and smelly tofu and cuttlefish balls on the menu make me want to love it for authenticity's sake. Also, dinner service was extremely fast!

I do come here often for the boba tea, which is probably the best in the city. The first time I went, I decided to be \"adventurous\" and get something that consisted of non-dairy creamer, egg, boba, and green apple syrup. Bad idea, but that was my fault. I should've taken the facial expression of the woman at the counter when I ordered as a warning.  Next time I just did the black milk tea. Much better!"}
{"text":"The food is decent. The Service is quick and attentive. Though sometimes the food can be heavy because it is DROWNED in oil. Rose Tea does have very authentic Tawainese food, just cooked in too much oil.

Some Dishes I would recommend:
Egg Pancake
Chunk Chicken 
Rice Cakes
Any of their lunch specials"}
{"text":"Decent food quality, inexpensive. I come here when I crave for Taiwanese food. I usually get takeouts instead of dine-in. Service highly depends on the waiter/waitress. Some are pretty good, but some can be downright rude (that's the main reason why I get takeouts, haha). Will recommend this place."}
{"text":"There is one thing that makes Rose Tea Caf√© heads and shoulders above all Asian competition in the Burgh: quality. The quality of their food is off the charts. We've frequented this place a few times and the freshness and flavors of their various dishes are uniquely different than the average Asian cuisine joint. The place is small but you can usually grab a table for two or three. It's five star."}
{"text":"One of the few places to get bubble (boba) tea, and they make it well.  Also, the service was excellent.  I just wasn't very thrilled with the food. I may have just ordered the wrong dish for me (lilly chicken), so I'll give it a second chance."}
{"text":"The waitress was adorable with her jokes. We ordered beef stew noodle soup and seafood kimchee hotpot. It was delicious. Beef in the soup was tender and soft as butter! The seafood hotpot was fantastic. They definitely know the American palate is spicy averse and they played up to  it. The boba tea is also very good. Nothing  but good words from a fellow local pittsburgher."}
{"text":"It's been months since this extension of Rose Tea in Squirrel Hill has opened--and still there has been no update or improvement to this place whatsoever. The 2 stars are for the few items that are worth eating on the menu, and maybe the overpriced bubble teas, but not much else is worth praising. 

Their food in general tastes better than the likes of OE and definitely Lulu's, but the amount of selection is abysmal. If you're looking for a meal, you only have a choice from around 10 rice dishes or noodle dishes; and of course the fried chicken leg and pork chop are greasy and accompanied by a tiny bit of vegetables in their attempt to recreate an authentic Taiwanese rice dish. It appears as though they are catering more to American tastes, though to their credit the dishes also come with a tea egg.

At least you get quantity over quality. One of the better choices is the zhajiangmian (Peking sauce noodles). While this is actually quite different from the Beijing version of the noodles (their name has nothing to do with the Beijing version of the noodles), their Taiwanese version is not too bad and also comes with a decent amount of vegetables on the sauce and noodles.

Their milk tea is of the same quality as the Rose Tea in Squirrel Hill, pretty decent but pricey as compared to Taiwanese enclaves on the west and east coasts (and hence not really worth it imho). You get a discount on them if you order them with a meal.

My last gripe is that they don't accept card. It was understandable when they first opened, but after half a year now it's just annoying. When every single place around you accepts card in place of cash, you're not going to attract a lot of people if you demand that they carry cash with them."}
{"text":"As hard as good Chinese food is to find in Pittsburgh, good Taiwanese food is even harder. This is the best you can get in the area, with a variety of different ethnic dishes. While most of their Taiwanese specials are a bit on the pricey side, there is usually enough such that 2 dishes can feed 3 people (or 3 dishes for 4). Definitely recommend the more exotic dishes--three cups chicken, pork strips with bamboo shoots, braised beef, Wuxi pork ribs, and even pork intestine!

My only gripe about their specialty dishes is that they are too big and pricey. While okay for a party of 3 or more, their portions are not ideal for a party of 2 (unless at least one has a limitless stomach). It'd be nicer if they could offer smaller portions for cheaper. One dish and one appetizer is also an option, but you wouldn't get as much variety in your meal. 

Avoid the Americanized dishes if you can--fried rice, fried noodles, and the like. Tried the pan fried noodles once and it was a disaster: completely overladen with sodium-rich sauce, weird combinations of vegetables (broccoli and canned baby corn, wtf?), and just way oversized portions.

Their bubble tea is okay. Probably one of the better ones in Pittsburgh, but still pretty expensive. Hop on a Megabus to NYC from time to time to get your bubble tea fix: way more variety, way cheaper, way better. Their service is also so-so, pretty much hit or miss depending on how many customers are present."}
{"text":"This place was OK. We just came for the tea, but we wanted to sit at a table to take a break from the heat outside. The place was empty except for us. The server kept hovering over us and rushing us to make our order and pay our bill, and there was another old dude, likely from the kitchen, sitting in the back eyeballing the shit out of us the whole time. Like we were inconveniencing their entire staff for just ordering drinks.

Besides that, the black milk tea I had was really good, and the honeydew smoothie I got to taste was also good. Would like to come back to try some food, as long they promise not to give me the stinkeye."}
{"text":"Just as I remembered it in college, filling and satisfying. I love the chicken with 3 spices and most of their clay pot items. It's very comfort food. That being said, it is very greasy and oily. You'll want some tea or boba to help wash it down.
I also got the short ribs with eggplant in clay pot and I loved how soft and flavor absorbing the eggplant was.

Service is very fast and efficient. We came here after waiting at our table for 20 minutes at the dim sum place across the street."}
{"text":"I would give it -5 starts if I could. I asked for a cup of taro bubble tea without ice. They gave me a cup of purple water with bubble. Like literally a cup of flavorless purple powder water. And it costed me $5. Nope, never again."}
{"text":"Been here couple of times based on recommendations given by Taiwanese friends. I especially love their iced teas. Usually end up getting the Taiwanese chunk chicken or the hot pot. Service is usually fast and appropriate. Stopped there one day for lunch , but they got really few items on that menu. Good place to go for a dinner where you want to have complete entrees."}
{"text":"Okay, the winter holidays brought me back from Asia to Stateside... and to more Asian food? Yeah, hazards of visiting an Asian family. It's been a while, but I'll venture a crack at my typical Chinese mother and her needs to eat the food of her people regardless of where she's at (yes, we did dine on Chinese near the Spanish Steps of Rome).

Surprisingly though, the Taiwanese food here is better than what you can find in Singapore. Weird. I know. 

This time around we found some better options to pick at this joint... faves stand as follows:  
- beef noodle soup 
- three cup squid (think of the three cup chicken but with squid)
- pig's blood spicy hot blood -- okay this is not for the faint of heart, or the non-adventurous, but I found it delicious, esp. ladled over a bowl of rice
- and to throw in some green (you know, for digestion), their simple stir-fried veg is nice and tasty

But you can pass over some of the other mediocre dishes, like the lu rou fan (the minced meat over rice) and their curry seafood dishes. 

Service isn't stellar, but when you compare to the likings of China and Singapore, it's bloody fantastic. Not to mention you can order take out as well. Oh, and we didn't meet the boss lady from hell, so that must of colored my review more favorably.

What can I say? My standards seem to have dropped. Asia's making me jaded."}
{"text":"Serves reasonably authentic[*] Taiwanese food. No, it's not the best I've had in the U.S. (it cannot be compared to even the most average place in San Gabriel Valley (of LA)), and yes, it's a bit over-priced (for Pittsburgh), but when you're in the mood for some Taiwanese sausages or taro cakes or cuttlefish balls or \"three cups chicken,\" they're the only game in town.  Personally, I enjoy the ambiance (crowds of Asian college students having a good time over bubble teas while the radio blares out J-pop tunes) though I imagine it's not for everyone.

[*] Re: authenticity -- by this I simply mean that they serve dishes that resemble some dishes known to people from Taiwan, and that their focus is not American-Chinese food. An earlier reviewer didn't find Rose Tea authentic enough because they don't serve Taiwanese styled breakfast and because their rendition of ma-po tofu doesn't match her recollection of the canon. I think that is too stringent a requirement for a mom-and-pop shop in Pittsburgh. Moreover, authenticity should not be confused with quality. There are plenty of terrible restaurants in Taiwan that are, by definition, authentic. There are also restaurants that serve delicious dishes that are unapologetically Americanized."}
{"text":"Love this place, the bubble tea is like none other and the eggplant with garlic sauce is stellar"}
{"text":"I post this review based on previous experiences as well as my most recent experience. I do so in hopes that they can change their operations and general attitude. If so, I will pay another visit when I visit back to the city. If not, they lost a great customer.

My previous experiences have been generally good. You can come in with a big group of people and cram in to enjoy a few different plates while enjoying the company of some good people. The servers are quick and get you food hot. The bubble teas are fantastic. Also, warm yourself up with the spicy pork roll with the delicious sauce. Noodles are good as well and, even though you may have ordered an Americanized dish, it's fresh, hot, and generous. As for my favorite, of course, you have to go with the black pepper chicken and broccoli!

Lately, the service has gotten rude and they'll take an Asian group over yours if they speak in Chinese. Food just doesn't arrive quickly enough and it's salty. Finally, dealing with the server was a pain as she didn't want to take the extra minute to hear my order.

So, Rose Tea, please wise up. The next time that I visit Pittsburgh, I would like to visit you. Don't disappoint me again."}
{"text":"Crispy chicken with salt is my favorite. I'll always choose it along with my entree. Although nothing special here, but the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"My absolute go-to bubble tea spot. They were the first, and they are the best. Variety of flavors and sizes, and the tapioca pearls are soft but not mushy. Just the right amount of bounce! They do not have the tendency to be occasionally hard and undercooked like other tea places. I usually get the Jasmine green tea, no milk, with tapioca. It isn't as sweet as some of the flavored teas and there is a fresh jasmine tea flavor. Flavored milk teas are excellent but more like a dessert drink than an iced tea. 

I was waiting until I tried their food to review them, and that was fantastic too! I ordered the tofu with chinese pepper. Had a really wonderful taste! Not too oily or too spicy. Perfectly seasoned. Tofu was chewy with crunchy exterior. It was really excellent. I can't wait to try more food from here!"}
{"text":"Pretty big portions, food tastes soooo good, decent customer service.  The short ribs with peppers is very good and also the pork intestine house style is good too, and also the braised pork chops!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite chinese/taiwanese restaurants around pittsburgh.  It has the best bubble tea, and the chunk chicken is equally amazing.  However, the food is somewhat expensive for a chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This review is for their bubble tea only...

First, they offer to types: Black or Green.  They also offer Milk Tea along with the standard Tea.  The drinks are prepared quickly and I enjoyed the Lychee Black Tea very much.  At $3.50 for 16 ounces, the price ain't all that bad either.  So, if I were to find myself in Squirrel Hill again, I'd return for another Tea, and probably give their food a shot too!"}
{"text":"I love Rose Tea Caf√©. Every time I visit, I order the chicken and broccoli in pepper sauce and and shrimp Lo mean and eat half of eat. The food tastes so fresh and flavorful. They cook it really quickly as well. I have never had a bad experience here. The only thing i would say wasn't as great my last visit is that it was so cold at my table by the window. We moved to another table and was still experiencing a cold draft every time someone entered. I get that it's winter, but I don't want to have to eat with my coat on."}
{"text":"It's been over a year since last time I came to Rose Tea, and I'm happy to report that it is just as delicious as always! They just expanded last week, and the old entrance is under construction. Now, you enter slightly to the right. The menu is the same.

I got a curry chicken special meal and my partner got marinated pork special meal. Both were $7.75 and came with veggies, rice, and an egg. I also got jasmine green tea with bubbles - my favorite thing here.

It's a great lunch spot, with large portions. We came at 2pm on a Tuesday and were the only ones here. Service is quick and friendly. The food is yummy, though pretty average. Come here for a dependable lunch."}
{"text":"Small location with limited seating. It only accepts cash, and the menu is slightly limited. But the few things I tried, the fried pork over rice, and curry chicken are both delicious and cheap. The fried pork was juicy with a crunch fried outside. The curry was also quite satisfying. The food is slightly on the oilier side, and wouldn't be suprised if there is a bit of MSG in it. In general I would prefer it over the nearby asian competitors: Little Asia, Lulu's Noodles, Oriental Express. But because of the limited menu, I'll visit Little Asia occasionally."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Nice little honey hole. The kao pao chicken is excellent."}
{"text":"Food is great! No matter if you're sitting in or ordering takeout, they are FAST! Usually if there's a line, you'll have to wait quite a bit but it's worth the wait! Recommend the 3 cup chicken, stir fried watercress with garlic, their pork chops are amazing, and their bubble teas are the best in all of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Rose Tea Cafe is always a \"must\" when I got back to Pittsburgh, not because it's filled with memories, but because the bubble tea and food are legit.

The bubble tea here is still probably one of the best I've had...ever. I'm talking more about the green tea/fruit concoctions then have. The milk teas are OK. The bubbles are chewy and sweet. love, love, love! 

My favorite dishes were the House Special Stir Fried Rice Cake and the Taiwanese Chunk Chicken. Sadly the chicken dish was pretty bad when I had it on Friday. I'm hoping that it was an off day. The rice cake dish was still great! The Beef with Baby Bamboo Shoots is also good, as is their Beef Noodle Soup. I always get their Egg Drop Soup as well.  I haven't really had anything not good at that place.

They are opening a new location on Craig St., next to the Bagel Factory."}
{"text":"Great place to go to if you're craving Taiwanese food in Pittsburgh. Not as good or as cheap as food you can get in Flushing but that's expected.

Scallion Pancake W. Beef - Beef rolled in a Crispy scallion pancake with a sauce that tastes like Hoisin Sauce or Tian Mian Jiang. one of my favorites here.

Beef W. Chinese Water Spinach In Sa-cha Sauce - Don't get this. Tasted good but was overcharged. Paid $17 when Chinese Water Spinach costs less than $3 and the beef probably cost like $2. 

San Bei Ji - decent. had lots of basil but could be more salty.

Stir Fried Smelled Bean Curd W. Basil - I love Stinky tofu so I thought this was really good. The leftovers really stunk up my mini-fridge afterwards though.

Fish w/ Black Bean Sauce - One of my favorites

Sauteed Sliced Pork W. Leeks - It's not actually leeks but the green garlic or garlic shoots. Always like this dish but probably unhealthy because the sliced pork is fatty pork.

Pork Chop Over Rice - One of the specials here I always get. The fried pork cutlet is well marinated and comes with Minced pork over rice and pickled vegetables.

Fried Chicken Cutlet Over Rice - Also one of their specials. Comes with the same things as the Pork chop over rice. The chicken is well marinated and the skin is crispy.

Curry Beef Over Rice - Japanese curry. Has a lot of onions.

Sauteed Sliced Pork W. Kim Chi - Kimchi with fatty pork. Delicious.

The bubble tea here is good if a little sweet. I always get their Lychee Green Tea with jelly."}
{"text":"Authentic asian foods. It can get a little greasy, depending on what you order. But it is nice that you can get bubble or (boba) tea there. The cheap budget meals are pretty good too. lol. I love getting those."}
{"text":"Came here once while staying in Pittsburgh for a tournament to get bubble tea. The peach green tea was good, but a little on the sweet side. The tapioca was perfect in quantity and quality! The price of the tea was amazing for the fast service and quality of the tea. I was in and out of the cafe in about 3 minutes. Remember to bring cash!! Would definitely visit again for the quick service, cheap prices, and great tea!"}
{"text":"The Rose Tea Cafe is probably the most \"Chinese\" Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh, offering authentic food that most nearby delivery Chinese joints wouldn't even know how to cook.

What does that mean?  If you've grown up eating Chinese food from American restaurants, some of Rose Tea's more eclectic fare may take some getting used to and some of the standard dishes (you know, the Sesame Chicken, the General Tso's) may taste a bit different.

My advice?  Be adventurous.  Try something that sounds weird.  If you like it, yay!  Otherwise...uh...try something else next time.

The lunch specials (that cover the front of the menu) are an excellent deal - especially if you enjoy their egg and vegetables or order a bubble tea to go along with it - and the dishes aren't too weird.

The atmosphere of the place is also nice.  It's small and cozy, with the tables far enough apart that eating doesn't feel cramped.  It can get quite loud inside, but that just another way Rose Tea makes it feel like a little piece of Chinatown in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Rose Tea Cafe has truly gone down the tubes since the days I was in college, when it first opened. I remember the hype of \"the first GOOD bubble tea place in Pittsburgh\" and it really did live up to being just that. Then I would come here and get my fix of beef noodle soup, rice with braised pork, rice with pork chops, sausage fried rice, etc. and leave pretty happy. 

But no longer. I came here this past week (nov 2008) and was very much disappointed. Perhaps if I came without the expectation of it being pretty good, I might have given this place 3 stars. But, the let down is not forgivable and I fear that I will opt never to come back here again. And to think, I used to rave about this place to other people?!! The food was excessively oily, with no distinguishable flavors except salt and soy sauce. The service was pretty pathetic too. Besides the employees, I think I only saw one other table of Chinese people out of a pretty full restaurant. That should've tipped me off in the first place!

So, please do NOT call this place authentic Taiwanese food. Ugh, the good ratings for this place kind of makes me wanna puke."}
{"text":"I love Rose Tea cafe. They have the best milk teas and their tapioca pearls are always properly cooked. I will routinely stop in to order my Almond Milk Tea with Tapioca Pearls and light sweetener. So much, in fact, that most of the people that work here recognize me and/or know what I am going to order.

I came in many times for my milk tea yet never stopped to try the food for the longest time. I did get to see the food pass by as I waited for my bubble tea to be made. It always looked and smelled so great that I finally decided to stop in before a movie one night.  Since that first dinner, I have stopped by several more times for dinner. We always get the Yeung Chow fried rice and fried dumplings. The fried rice is some of the best in the area, while the dumplings are passable.

I have tried several of the dinners on the menu: pork belly with kimchee, stewed pork belly, spicy chicken in a casserole, and spicy short ribs. I have really enjoyed all of them. The flavors are all rather wonderful. I am still looking for that dinner entree that I crave, but I know I will continue to return due to my craving for the Almond Milk Tea with Pearls."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I wrote this once before, but somehow the review got removed. Anyway, given that I'm adamantly against this place, here we go again.

Like many of the other reviewers have said, the middle aged guy behind the counter is pretty rude. The older lady that works at Rose Tea is also really rude - seems like she lives with a constant chip on her shoulder. I remember that during the first time I came to Rose Tea, the older lady basically *told* us we need to tip them. Excuse me?

I only come here when there's nothing else around for lunch. Normally I get the eggplant in garlic sauce, but the most recent time I got that dish it tasted absolutely disgusting. The eggplant was only barely cooked, meaning it wasn't at the right mushy texture. I had to stir fry it again for dinner in order for it to taste somewhat decent.

I used to come here for bubble tea, but ever since Fuku Tea opened down the street near Pitt campus I've basically avoided Rose Tea at all costs. Fuku Tea has the best bubble tea, and the service is much better. Also, they take credit cards with no minimums. Why risk raising your cortisol levels by going to Rose Tea at Craig when you can have better food and service somewhere else? A silly question, if you ask me."}
{"text":"Seeing that there is a cute hole in the wall Taiwanese place in Pittsburgh really got me excited so last night I decided to meet a friend for dinner here. 

Coming into the place I saw an immediate great sign- the place was packed! My friend and I only waited a few minutes for a table and were greeted immediately. I ordered the peach green bubble tea and she ordered the passion green bubble tea- they were both sweet, smooth and fresh tasting! 
The only problem we experienced with the service was the rush we both felt to make a decision but we quickly made up our minds. I went against my gut of getting the chunk chicken and decided to play it safe w chicken lo mien my friend, who is a vegetarian went with the saut√©ed eggplant which looked awesome.

Quickly after ordering our food was brought to us in giant sized portions and was piping hot. The food tasted authentic but was a little on the greasy side but nonetheless I really enjoyed rose tea and would definitely go there again soon."}
{"text":"Advance warning: the rose tea cafe is not a pretentious foody place. If you're looking for nicely decorated place with a classy atmosphere and the latest molecular gastronomy concoction this place is not it. Instead, at this rose tea cafe you'll get some hearty food (read at least double fried if not deep fried) sometimes served in bento boxes with rice and pickled eggs (and about  3 green peas for decor). You can also get a nicely wrapped bubble tea!"}
{"text":"I can never bring myself to eat here. Ever since I was taking the trash out in the alley behind the cafe, I saw the line cooks shaving each others heads out back in their aprons. Just grossed me out."}
{"text":"I'm currently living in Cleveland, and no joke...this place is worth the two hour drive! The place is always busy, so if you have a big party you should definitely call and make a reservation. 

Food=

Scallion pancake with beef- Inside a crispy pancake roll is beef that's been marinated with some sort of sauce...maybe Hoisin? A good starter for the meal

Taiwanese sausage- If you've never had asian sausages, you should know that we like our sausages sweet, not salty. A simple dish, served with slices of garlic and very good. 

Shredded pork with baby bamboo- I love bamboo, and mixed in with pork was a good side dish. 

Three cup chicken- A very popular dish, and one I definitely love to order when I come here. The chicken is very tender and marinated in sauce so it's never dry. The sauce is made primarily of soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar and with ginger and basil. 

Stinky tofu- Although I've tried it multiple times, I'm still not a fan of stinky tofu. Surprisingly when my friends ordered it here, it wasn't as stinky as it usually is when cooked at other places. I wonder if that's a good or bad thing though haha. 

Kimchi seafood hotpot- Since one of our friends doesn't eat red meat, she got the kimchi seafood hotpot. It was hot and spicy, and over some rice it was very good. It's a good alternative for those that are in the mood for some seafood or something spicy. However, I can't say it's the best kimchi seafood hotpot I've ever had. 

Boba- I've had the milk tea and taro boba flavors before. I have to say, every time I get boba here I'm NEVER disappointed. It's always very fresh with just the right amount of sugar. Some boba places can pack on the sugar, and you feel wired and just gross when you get to the bottom of the cup. But Rose Tea boba is one of the best I've had since moving to the Midwest!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here a few Saturday nights ago with my girlfriend for dinner.  I have been coming here for the past five years or so, more often than not for their bubble tea and have only ever eaten here once before.  The inside of the restaurant is fairly small but not overly crowded which is nice.  On one side of the restaurant is an enclosed counter where you can order food to go or watch them make the bubble tea and the rest of the restaurant is made up of tables and chairs.

For my dinner entr√©e I decided to have something a little different than my normal selections and went with the chicken and broccoli in a black pepper sauce.  Whenever the dish came out it looked exactly as I would have expected with some broccoli and chicken in a dark brown sauce that had visible pepper in it and side of rice.  The sauce was good but not nearly as spicy as I was expecting based upon the little chili pepper that was next to it on the menu.  It paired well with the chicken and broccoli and I ended up thoroughly enjoying my meal.  I especially enjoyed that my broccoli was cooked just right and was crispy instead of being overcooked and mushy.  My girlfriend also enjoyed her meal which was the eggplant in garlic sauce.  Her eggplant was also cooked nicely and the sauce was very similar to the one that I had except instead of the pepper it seemed to have a nice garlic flavor.  Before we left I also ordered a Large Green Lemon Bubble tea which I enjoyed on the way home.  They always seem to make it perfectly with a not too sweet flavor that goes well with the citrus and ample amounts of tapioca pearls at the bottom which get you through the entire drink.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely head back here in the future.  With how good my food tasted I can see myself coming here more often and not just because I love the bubble tea."}
{"text":"Food is huge part of Taiwanese culture.  I travelled to there a couple years ago.  I was far outside Taipei for the better part of a month and was able to find (with help) several local, non-touristy places to eat.  Absolutely some of the best meals I have ever eaten - and sometimes the most exciting.

This is why I was thrilled to find the Rose Tea Cafe.  I don't think dining here will ever duplicate my Taiwan experiences because there are certain things that just will not translate well as ingredients may not be accessible or customers may not provide the demand.  However, the basics are here, the food if fresh and exciting, and every meal had left me remembering that great month in Taiwan.

Xie xie, RTC."}
{"text":"Been going here for years and outside of the fact that the chairs are not comfy and the table layout is bad, I always love the food.  Last night I tried to go to the New How Lee- too crowded so I walked down the street to Rose Tea and I am glad-  I had Tofu with Basil and a house special call Fish Fillet with cellaphane noodles- both were great- This place likes to liberally throw in the garlic, basil and hot peppers and the taste is not overwhelming but constantly good.  They have a huge selection of teas and serve tall glasses of water."}
{"text":"This place is actually underrated. The food here is actually quite decent and authentic. Too bad they don't take credit card though."}
{"text":"Bubble tea--on the go!

I've only ever been here for the bubble tea, but this place is an awesome (and quick) stop if you're looking for bubble tea after a meal in Squirrel Hill, or just in general.

I've tried both the Lemon Green Tea and Mango and haven't been disappointed yet. I definitely recommend the green teas versus the milk versions!"}
{"text":"So this is an update to my lasts review of rose tea, so after I ate there I got really nauseous I guess because the sauce on the food I order which was the traditional beef with broccoli was reallllyyyy thick and heavy!! I had to make and late night run some anti emetic so I wouldn't vomit, how ever I'd go back and give this place a second try.."}
{"text":"Fxxk the service here. Food is nice but service is garbage. I gave them just 5% tip cuz the service was horrible and they tried to serve me rice that wasn't properly cooked, they ended up chasing me onto the street asking for more tips... The dude said something like \"our policy is 18% tip at least.\"

F this place. Disgrace to Taiwan."}
{"text":"Of all the places in Pittsburgh where I have tried bubble tea, Rose Tea Cafe definitely has the most extensive selection. They also seem to have the most authentic setup, complete with a bubble tea shaker machine. 

I had the black tea milk tea. It wasn't overly sweet, but it had a bit of a chalky texture from the mix they use. Their boba are okay, I like them to be somewhat sweeter, these were on the bland side. I did like the smaller size of their boba, some places use large ones that easily get stuck in the straw. All in all I liked the flavor of it overall, other than the chalkiness that is left behind in the cup. I am eager to try some of the other flavors.

The service was fine and we got our drinks quickly. We have not yet tried the food, but it definitely smelled good in there, so we'll give it a go next time."}
{"text":"I really like the food here. We ordered lots of food and it all taste really good and the price is definitely worth it. As I check the review about this restaurant, there are lots of review about the service but the service I got that day was actually pretty good. 

We have hot and sour soup, fried rice, scallion pancake with egg, beef with chinese watercress in Sa-cha sauce and home style tofu. The food taste just like the food that you would get in Taiwan."}
{"text":"They picked up on my ABC (American Born Chinese) accent right away!  That and the \"QQ\"ness of the boba speak to the authenticity of this place!  Bustling little place located in what I like to think of as the \"chinatown of pittsburgh\".

Veer away from the smoothie drinks--my \"strawberry smoothie\" boba was a hot pink color that was nowhere near natural.  You judge a boba place by its plain milk tea anyways and it was thumbs up in my opinion.  Ask for the BIG BOBA or else they give you the little ones and then your big straw is just useless.

Some favorites:  home style tofu, sweet and sour pork chop, my favorite veggie dish \"si gua\" with scallops.  Everything we've had from here has been yummy and I already know what I want next.  Next time--beef noodle soup, you are mine!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with a couple friends to have some bubble tea. Almond milk is my favorite and it was delicious.
Second time I came here, we were seated to order more drinks. A young waitress looked unhappy that we weren't going to order food. Just as we were about to order, the young waitress tells us to leave the table because they have to seat a group who will order food. Yikes. It wasn't a question, it was a demand. Didn't offer to seat us somewhere else. Wasn't happy about that kind of service at all. 

Drinks are good. Service is bad. 1 star and not coming back."}
{"text":"Authentic - maybe - In not one that would know this. 

Good - Not to me.  

Portion size was small (had carry out - not sure if it matters), think there was 1/2 of oil in the container after i finished eating it.   Have had way better noodle dishes for 1/2 the price of this place.  

Guess the other reviews on the downfall of this place are spot on!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food but the service could be better.  Even when picking up take out they are rude.  Its like they are doing me a favor.  That being said, their food is fresh and flavorful.  Great vegetarian selection.  Price is not cheap but reasonable for the quality.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Used to come here often while I was going to school nearby. For its proximity to campus, I would say it was very good. They have a lot of menu options to choose from, and the food tastes great. By far my favorite dish is the chunk chicken (or three cup chicken if you take the literal translation).  You can also get bubble tea here.

My biggest complaint is the small amount of rice they give you for the amount of food you get. I tried to eat as little amount of rice as I could with each bite, but still there wasn't nearly enough. So I had to ask for more. Most good Chinese restaurants will not charge you for additional rice because it costs very little. So I was surprised when I got my bill that there was an extra charge, especially since I was given no warning or heads up about it at all. If they're going to charge extra for rice, it's polite to inform the client of the charge and ask if they still want it. On top of that, they try to hide the charge by writing it in Chinese so you can't tell unless you really look hard at your check. I don't know if it was just coincidence or another sneaky move, but somehow the extra charge for rice EXACTLY matched the amount of tax. So it was very confusing to determine if it was an extra charge, or them simply doing some weird math on the bill. Fortunately I caught it and had to ask the waiter what that additional charge was, and he confirmed that it was indeed the rice.

It's a shame because outside of that, I would've been very happy with my meal and experience here. But I feel I should give everyone a fair warning in case they make the same mistake."}
{"text":"I know the critical reviews about this place are usually positive so I tried to go in with an open mind every time. This place is loved and a quick go to when trying to pick a proper Chinese restaurant. 

However, no matter how hard I try, I don't think that it's all it has been cracked up to be. Their food is okay and sometimes too salty. I think that while the dishes are authentic, it isn't done well enough for the price you pay for it. I am usually a bit disappointed after leaving this place. The place is small and cramped and you can tell that they didn't put much effort into making it be aesthetically pleasing."}
{"text":"Looooooove it!  this is exactly what my mom would make.  Aint nothing wrong with eating some seriously home made food.  Especially when mommy's not there to cook it for you!  Seriously, this was my HAVEN in college.  I have not found a single place anywhere (within PGH and outside of PGH) that serves better authentic Taiwanese cuisine.  

Also, great bubble tea which also happens to be taiwanese.  kinda fits the whole taiwanese theme."}
{"text":"Rose Tea Cafe, I had really high hopes for you. After the mediocre (nicely putting it) service in the Squirrel Hill location, I was really hoping you'd become more people friendly so costumers would actually want to go to your restaurant.

I rarely give out one stars, but the service was so poor that I feel obligated to. When me and my friend went into Rose Tea, there was a huge clump of people at the door waiting for their food. There were also no seats available. With no clear signs stating that there was a difference between the takeout section, and the sitdown section, when the person serving asked us hurriedly if we were ready to order, we did. 

When we tried to sit down, we got yelled at by the waitress. She accused us of trying to cheat them out of tips by ordering take-out and sitting down to eat it. She also told us \"not to speak Chinese\" when we tried to clarify.

Excuse me? If you guys had clearly marked what costumers were supposed to do, or if the waiter had even asked if we wanted to sit down, or order out instead of expecting us to know what to do, we would've been more than happy to accommodate. 

Needless to say, this whole experience left a bitter taste in my mouth, and the greasy food couldn't chase that down either.

This restaurant is definitely entering my list of never-to-return places."}
{"text":"Rose Tea Cafe has pretty good food (I recommend the fried shrimp rice), and good pearl milk tea. However, it doesn't have legit 'Taiwanese' food like it claims. Instead, it is very basic normal Chinese food. There is a $15 minimum requirement for credit card usage, and the staff can be rather rude at times, especially with tipping. 

Overall, I think Rose Tea Cafe is a-okay for every once in a while, but it's definitely not a place I will be frequenting all the time."}
{"text":"After Yelp searching, we suggested this Taiwanese restaurant to my friend during our recent visit to Pittsburgh.  Her response: oh my gosh, that's exactly where I was planning to take you!

The bubble here was very good - not overwhelmingly sweet like in Cleveland, and the boba had the right texture.  Even my girlfriend (who is from LA) enjoyed it, though she was bothered by the price ($3.75).

The food here was very tasty as well.  We had xiang gan rou si (beef with tofu) and a beef noodle soup that were both excellent.  In fact, they were so good that we came back to this restaurant the next day for take out food for the drive home.  According to my girlfriend, the xiang gan rou si was prepared how it was supposed to be done :)  We were very pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Yeah, I know it's Taiwanese, but I'd regard this as the best Chinese food in Pittsburgh. The stuff actually tastes and has flavor. Love the Stinky Tofu. Food's authentic, yo. 

Based on all the Chinese food I've had in the states, my opinion of this place sits at three stars. But by Pittsburgh standards? Four."}
{"text":"I had heard this was a good place to eat and finally decided to give a try a few days ago. What a huge disappointment it was. The atmosphere was below average, with big blasts of cold air washing over the middle of the dining room every time someone came and went. We had to get up and move to a different table. The food was nothing special, to say the least. The portions were small and when we asked for more rice, we were charged extra! I do not recommend this place, especially since there are so many excellent Asian food spots within a short walk."}
{"text":"Service sucks here. It's almost like they're mad you come in, and then proceed to talk about whatever they were so consumed by."}
{"text":"An hour to delivery less than a mile. And the broth of the House Noodle Soup was so weak it was inedible."}
{"text":"I've gotten takeout from here once, and also came in for lunch one day, so I think I can safely call this four-star food.  When we got take out, the only thing I can remember for sure that we ordered was the Shredded Beef with Chinese Hot Pepper, and it was SPICY!  I remember we needed a lot of beverage along with that one.  We really liked it though, and I remember it was fresh-tasting compared to most take-out.

When I came in for lunch, I arrived right when they open for the day (I want to say 1130 am on a Monday).  I was really excited to have bubble tea, but they said it wasn't available yet - they have to make the tapioca pearls, or let them cool, or something like that.  Bummer!  But I can't argue with that, I don't want hot, malformed bubbles in my tea.  So wait an hour after they open if you want boba.

The menu was HUGE, and descriptionless, so it's pretty hard to figure out what you want.  Just take a guess.  I went for the Ma Po Spicy Bean Curd, which is vegetarian (although I think, traditionally, there is also meat in the dish).  The portion was massive, both hot in temperature and spice level.  The beautiful steaming bowl was filled with soft, almost creamy tofu, and vegetables (frozen ones) swimming in sauce.  I have to say, it was pretty darn good.  I didn't even miss the meat or wish that the vegetables hadn't come from a bag.  There was so much food, I ate Ma Po Tofu for nearly three meals.  It's a bargain.  The server was very nice too, prompt and helpful.

Can't wait to come back, try more things on the menu, and get bubble tea!"}
{"text":"This was my second time dining at Rose Tea Cafe. We decided to try their rice meals this time, since they looked really good when I saw people eating them the week before, when a friend and I stopped by for some bubble tea. 

My husband had the fried chicken cutlet over rice and I had the beef stew over rice. Both were delicious, but I thought the fried chicken cutlet was sooooooo much more delicious in comparison. I am definitely getting it next time we come back."}
{"text":"Really good mango green tea!!

-1 star bc the place looks and smells dirty. (Especially smells - the scent hits you hard.) and their boba is in an open, uncovered bowl, which kind of worries me. Other than that, the tea is good. Glad we found this gem. :)"}
{"text":"I'm familiar with the Squirrel Hill location so I was excited to see this location open.  The bubble tea menu is still extensive, but the food menu is considerably smaller with only a few options in the appetizer and entrees section.  They said they may be expanding their menu later though.  I got the egg scallion pancakes and cold noodles and both were good though a little pricey for being appetizer sizes.  I spent $15 in total for a bubble tea and 2 appetizers.  The green tea bubble tea I got was also good.  The atmosphere is interesting since the way the countertop and cabinets are setup makes this look like a kitchen inside a home rather than a restaurant which is kind of cool.  All the staff were very friendly.  Seating area is pretty limited so I got mine to go and it came out quickly.

UPDATE:
I went a 2nd time and got the pork noodle soup to go.  It tasted good, but was really hard to eat as a to go item because they give it to you with the soup base, noodles, and pork all in separate containers!  The soup base container was almost filled to the top so it was impossible to mix in the noodles and pork into it.  Also the pork came as a whole gigantic piece bones and all so it was really difficult to eat (especially with no knife).  I would have preferred to have the pork chopped up and to either put it all in one container or use a bigger container for the soup base so it's possible to mix it all together.  Since this place doesn't have a lot of seating it seems important to have the to go items packaged in a convenient matter."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for dinner so far and the first time I ordered a typical Chinese dish which I think was a lo mein but it was pretty bland and the sauce was too thick.  The second time I came I ordered from the spicy beef kim chi soup from the Chef's specialties section of the menu and it was amazing.  It came out simmering on an individual hot pot and the beef was really tasty and it was flavored perfectly.  They do have a really extensive menu, also with some interesting authentic Taiwanese options I'd like to go back and try.  I wanted to get just a simple hot tea with my meal but I was informed they didn't have a \"house tea\" and directed to the special tea section of the menu which only included bubble teas and other fancy teas for over $3 each.  Would be nice to just be able to get a simple cup of hot tea, which many asian restaurants provide included with your meal.  Service is hit or miss, perhaps depending on how busy they are.  Seating area is pretty small with tables close together."}
{"text":"I love the Taiwanese food here. It is a relatively good place to come here with your friends. However, I would not recommend coming with your parents. The restaurant is between of a fast food and Taiwanese restaurant (really nice for college students who wants a relatively fast and good meal). However, it is a bit pricey. 

Food I recommend: Bubble Tea, Dinner combos, and San Bei Ji (Three Cup Chicken)"}
{"text":"Rose Tea is as good as it gets for Chinese food in Pittsburgh, especially for Taiwanese people, so I give it 5 stars for fitting its niche. It doesn't have the fanciest dishes, but it's got good homestyle comfort food. I especially liked coming here for their soups which are light and flavorful, not like those excessively starch thickened soups at other  places."}
{"text":"Normally I would give this establishment a 4 or 5-star review.  I've already done so for their sister shop Pink Box Bakery Cafe.  The bubble tea was pretty tasty, and I'm just really excited to see bubble tea smoothies being offered in the 'Burgh!  

BUT.... but.... we were asked to leave because we did not order food. Both my friend and I ordered bubble tea smoothies with boba and jelly and, along with tip, our bill came to around $14.  We sat down to drink our shakes, and were asked to leave 5 minutes later to make room for other customers who may be purchasing food.  Not even asked really.  More like shooed out.

I totally understand that this is a small place.  Still, when I enter a business that is advertised as a bubble tea bar (note the giant bubble tea on the sign), I expect to be able to sit down and leisurely enjoy my $6 to $7 purchase without being rudely asked to vacate my table.  At least put some benches outside if you cannot accommodate your customers."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get bubble tea in Pittsburgh.  The food is good too.  Today I tried and enjoyed the marinated pork special.  But what really sticks out to me about Rose Tea Cafe is the service.  It has always been fast, friendly, and very accommodating.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for bubble tea, a meal, or both in the Squirrel Hill area."}
{"text":"I had Sunday lunch with a bunch of Taiwanese that go there frequently. Apparently as authentic Taiwanese as you get.

That much said I personally thought the food was just good and not great. We shared a variety of dishes family style including pepper beef. Nothing really stood out. Service is pretty average.

If you like Taiwanese food, this is probably the place for you. If you are ambivalent then I doubt anything will really wow you and it will be just another moderately priced Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I must say, despite of the so called Taiwanese cuisine they say, the place is not somewhere I would ever recommend someone to go to.

I went with friends to this place 3 times while being a student, which was not long ago. Every time, the place never provided great service. The owner, who is behind the counter, was not very welcoming. The waiters had done a much better job than she did.

We ordered several dishes, and tried them out. I can firmly say, being of Taiwanese descent, that the food was not Taiwanese food as they say they are. The strong flavorings covered the soggy meat and vegetables, which made the food taste very cheap. The portions were quite small, and truly I'm not amazed.

The bubble tea was not really bubble tea either. It's just tea with powdered flavoring, with milk covering the overall taste. It does not taste like tea.

Most of my friends who loves food agrees that they would not visit the place again in the future. In fact, if you talk to various people, some might give you stories on how mistreated they were when they dine there.

Oh, and make sure you bring cash too. The place requires $15 or more for use of credit card. Honestly, I've never seen a place that required such high minimum for the use of plastic. It's not student friendly also as many of them use plastic as their main payment."}
{"text":"The food is good but I would give it 0 star if I could. The guy cashier who I believe owns the restaurant gives me an attitude EVERY SINGLE TIME I visit and he works everyday so if you ever visit this place you will meet him. I have never heard a thank you from his mouth; the way he takes money from customers is rude, he doesn't look at you into your eyes(matter of fact he doesn't even look at you); when giving back my card he just puts/throws it on the table and I have to pick it up; and he pushes the receipt that I need to sign to me on the table without saying a word (nope he didn't say anything like \"please sign ur name\")."}
{"text":"Beef noodle soup is awesome!!! Even comes with pickled cabbage!

Taiwanese sausage fried rice is also very good. GOt it at a different time, and it was also good.

Pork chop over rice was very good.

Taro cake, boo.

Small, but very good restaurant. Def will be returning!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find authentic Taiwanese food. I was pleased to come across Rose Tea Cafe. Being in a rush, I got the beef stew noodles to go. The soup is well spiced and authentically flavored. Although the beef chunks are well cooked, there were only a few pieces. I was a bit peeved when I found a piece of hair in the noodles. The noodles themselves also gave off a strange odor. Total cost: just over $9. 

Parking is side- street parking. 

I would go there again to give the bubble tea and the rest of the menu another shot.

UPDATE: went back recently, and had the salt and pepper fish with rice. Lovely. I'm still not a fan of the service, just very curt and not friendly. They always seem like they're in a rush to push you to finish which I suppose makes sense since the space is so small."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave two stars is because of the food. The service was good, and the servers were nice and friendly. But the food I ordered was nothing like what I would get in restaurants in Taiwan. 
I ordered a stir-fried vegetable and fried beef with scallion. Both the dishes were thickened with cornstarch (?? in Chinese). Um... I know it is common to do this in Chinese restaurants in America but no one really does it in Taiwan, or at least I have never saw anyone does this to these two dishes in Taiwan. Also the food is a bit too salty, at least in my opinion. Every Taiwanese people I know in Pittsburgh loves their bubble milk tea, but I'm not a fan of it so I don't know if it is really good."}
{"text":"Rose Tea is our go-to for Taiwanese food in Pittsburgh. Been here too many times to count while in college, and it definitely caters to the college crowd. I believe they've cut down a little bit on portion sizing since 8 years ago, but hey, the economy is different. 

Anyway, the food here is excellent. Basically anything you get will be a good representation of true Taiwanese food, as long as you pick something from the Taiwanese side of the menu. The one-plate meals are always excellent value, and I'd recommend going for the fried chicken or pork chop. The braised fatty pork is also really good. The San-Bei-Ji is well done here. I also really like the pig intestine hot \"stew\" here as well. Mmmm.... The Beef Noodle Soup is pretty good as well. Of course, bubble tea from Rose Tea is one big reason to visit, and prices are on par for the area.

Service is usually a bit spotty, but they're always busy with the small dining area. Bring your A-game when looking for a seat, because you'll be sniping them. Not gonna lie, it does help if you are Taiwanese."}
{"text":"Good food by any standard.  Fresh, tasty, amazing soups on a cold Pittsburgh day.  Just don't go too late."}
{"text":"Came here for some bubble tea after lunch. Their black tea isn't bad. It's a bit sweet and a little milky, but it's not too too bad. It's a nice place to come and just chill with a milk tea."}
{"text":"These are one of my favorite restaurants to eat because they have good service and they have bubble tea. If you don't know what bubble tea is, try it! The food is amazing with the Taiwanese touch."}
{"text":"I have been to Pittsburgh twice and some how I have been to this place both times. It's probably because I am with people who used to live in the area but I am not opposed to going back here.

The food is pretty good and it comes out fast and tastes pretty good.

I would recommend it if you are looking for something good, fast and affordable."}
{"text":"There is a lot to say about this restaurant and many will give you mixed responses.

First off, I'll say (boldly) that this restaurant serves the best and most authentic Chinese/Taiwanese food in Pittsburgh. The dishes are so flavorful and well-done that your taste buds will relish in happiness. Dishes of note are the Kimchi Seafood Hotpot, Taiwanese Chunk Chicken (aka three cup chicken), and Beef Noodle Soup.

Now for some cons. The restaurant staff will try to shoo you away during peak hours, often cleaning up your food and drink without asking for your permission. While this may seem rude, I can understand because the place is really small and they want to make sure people who are waiting for a table are seated. You need to accept that this will happen during peak hours. If you don't like it, come at off-peak hours.

Some of the really good dishes are quite pricey, but it's well worth it. You're stomach and taste buds won't complain one bit."}
{"text":"The food was really really good and the bubble tea was great. We got the seafood Kim chi hot pot which was presented really well and VERY hot. It was delicious. I got the jasmine green tea bubble tea and that was great, not too sweet and the boba was cooked perfectly. A great place to go if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've been in Pittsburgh for so long, and just tried this place. It's really really good Chinese/Taiwanese food (authentic too!). If it's your first time, definitely get the Taiwanese chunk chicken. The service is also pretty good. There's also a rose tea on Craig street - it's not very good at all. Squirell hill is waaaaaaay better."}
{"text":"I always judge Taiwanese cafes by how good their pork chop + rice is.  Here, the pork chop was good and the ground beef on top of the rice was okay.  I was bummed the vegetables were mixed vegetables that probably came out of a bag.

The bubble tea was okay.  I was slightly disappointed because I had heightened expectations after reading all the Yelp reviews, but it wasn't bad.

Service was so sweet and accommodating, though."}
{"text":"I m bummed out, maybe they changed owners because I used to eat here all the time in college five years ago. If you'd ask any college dude at the time what the best thing was for the money, they'd say it's the fried chicken cutlet over rice. I had it tonight and I think they changed the batter and quality of chicken. It was awful, I stopped eating it after one bite and then spiked it in the trash like a football. What a shame, but all good things have to end I guess. I did have Italian village after that, which is a good thing that still hasn't changed. 

I'm not writing a yelp post because of that, that's sort of trivial or I don't really have time to care about it. BUT when the lady there gave me her slight, it sort of hatched very presumptuous thoughts and I wanted to know if I'm wrong about them. So I ordered the cutlets and two bubble teas and for some reason it cost 30 bucks, when it used to be near 20. Anyways she started putting the bubble teas in the bag with hot food, I was like 'hey pleas don't do that can I have another bag for those? She looked at me as if I fked up somehow, like how dare me.. then she pulled out these individual bags made for the bubble tea, got one, then stacked both of them in there. I don't know what to say to that sequence of events, other than it's not worth it..

Maybe the owners switched? Or maybe since they got allot of business using delivery, they don't care about quality, as what happens with allot of Chinese places. Anyways, it's allot of stuff to write. This place sucks now. I hope my friends see this and take note."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Taiwanese food. Try the Taiwanese Chunk Chicken (often called 3 cups basil chicken) which is the most famous Taiwanese dish. Full of flavor and they do it well here. Also I love the Taiwanese Sausage Fried Rice. Simple dish but very interesting flavors.
Also tried the Beef with Chinese Watercress. Was a decent dish worth trying if you like watercress.

One warning is that they use MSG in a lot of their dishes but you can request for them to leave it out."}
{"text":"The food at this place is good. I don't have any complaints in regards to the food. I used to come here pretty often in college to get the fried chicken cutlet over rice. I started bringing my wife here when I met her 11 years ago and she and I both enjoy the food. We don't come very often anymore since we moved but when we are on this side of town we try to eat here. The bubble tea is good but sometimes the pearls aren't done right."}
{"text":"While the restaurant was empty, my kids and i stopped in to enjoy bubble teas for all of us.  Waiter was rude and kicked us out telling us they are not a coffee shop.

I have previously enjoyed their food but this will be my last time."}
{"text":"Ok, just visited the Rose Tea for the first time specifically to try their Bubble Tea.  It was so good and different from anything...  ever!  Thoroughly enjoyed a beverage that you chew.  Great flavor, interesting textures - will definitely need more Bubble Tea!

We shared their House Dish and Chunk Chicken.  Both were very good, excellent flavors, served hot and very quickly.  I would not hesitate to try anything on the menu, and will, for sure.

Now for service, which cost a star...  Not friendly.  When I told them how much I enjoyed my first Bubble Tea experience there was no response.  Isn't that weird?  And when they took the plates I again complimented the food.  Same response.  Kind of a downer.  So be adaptable:  next time, I'll direct all of my enthusiasm to my companion and not expect interaction.  Great food + fabulous bubble tea Vs stoic-but-effective service?  FOOD WINS!"}
{"text":"We stopped in quickly to get some bubble tea, and it's a cute little shop with a few tables, but probably not somewhere you'd stay too long. More like a place to get a quick bite and go. I did see what some people were eating, and it looked and smelled pretty good.

On to our bubble tea, though - I ordered a black tea and coffee milk bubble tea, hot. It was really good; maybe not to the level that they serve up at those special places in HK, but I thought it was pretty tasty.

My wife ordered taro tea, and it had pretty good taro flavor without being too sweet, but there was hardly any tea flavor to it. It basically just tasted like taro powder, so she didn't end up finishing it.

Overall OK, I might try another flavor if I'm in the area again"}
{"text":"Anytime I am craving my grandmother's cooking, I grab something from Rose Tea to take home. I highly recommend the beef pancake roll and their house special rice cakes. You can't go wrong with anything on their menu and their bubble tea is the best I've had in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Food is legit - stopped in for a snack and got the Pork with Leeks. Good balance of soy and sugar. Service may be lacking but that's not a deal breaker for a space this small."}
{"text":"Rose Tea Cafe has fantastic Bubble Tea. The food is good, but not extraordinary, but portions are generous, and service is fast.

In sum, while there are better Taiwanese restaurants in Pittsburgh, Rose Tea Cafe is worth the trip for the bubble tea alone."}
{"text":"Most of their dishes are pretty mediocre....characterized by thick sauces lacking in flavor or dominated by saltiness, characteristics of americanized chinese food.

But, sadly, this is one of the better places to find chinese food in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"OMG. SAN BEI JI is pure awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"How could I not love Rose Tea Cafe?! This was the first place that served up bubble tea and the food is not half bad either!  I love the shaved ice dessert above all else.. This place does not disapoint with the choice of dishes on the menu.. I usually order the three cup chicken - delish! a must go for great taiwanese food.. I'm not sure if they have expanded the restaurant but if I remember, the place is small and it does get crowded during busy hours.. still not too bad of a wait tho."}
{"text":"First time ordered for delivery here and probably my last. The food is very good I have nothing to complain about it but the service was off putting. The delivery guy called that he has arrived and said \"You pay tip\" in a demanding way. I usually cash tip but that was just rude. Mind you I was literally 2 minutes from the restaurant and I could of just picked it up myself if I knew this was to happen. I checked my food when I got upstairs to the apartment and one of my dishes were wrong. I immediately called the restaurant to let them know that it was wrong and the lady on the phone told me they would redo the dish they messed up. She rudely told me to make sure to give the delivery guy the wrong dish back. Cmon lady don't be upset with me that YOU GUYS messed up my order in the first place!  .... oh they btw they added additional top on my credit card that I did not approve"}
{"text":"The place is casual, and quite noisy, but not in a disturbing way.

The food is good, but one MUST TRY is the Taiwanese Chunk Chicken. Amazing!!

Not exactly cheap, compared to the looks of the place, but their portions are big."}
{"text":"Bubble Tea!!!

Tarro root bubble tea is a must on a hot summer day....or any other day.  Rose Tea makes a really good cup of it.

Good food too, though it's been years since I've actually eaten there."}
{"text":"Not great, but also not bad. The food is very greasy and not the best Asian food around, but I don't hate it for some reason. I ordered the eggplant and chicken on rice and it was a good portion for a pretty cheap price. I would not suggest this place if I were eating out with friends (the interior is pretty small), but if I ever once again find myself on Craig or on CMU campus hungry and craving Chinese food, I will probably drop by for takeout."}
{"text":"The place looks a little jenky (as most hole-in-the wall places do) but my drink was pretty darn good. I wish I had had more stomach space and time to try more of the food but for the little bit I had it was A-OK. Would have given the place a 4 for the drink but the food brought it down a bit.

VENUE: Typical Taiwanese cafe vibe. Very casual. Good for a quick grabbing of a beverage to quench your thirst.

FOOD/DRINK:  Ordered the PASSIONATE TEMPTATION. Delicious! It had just the right amount of sweetness and tartness. Eventhough they make their drinks with syrup, there were passionate fruit seeds in my drink! Loved it. Maybe they use real juice for that. I'm not sure. I wasn't crazy about the tapioca boba as they weren't that sweet/flavorful. But they were chewy and were not hard so that's always nice.

My friends and I split the GREEN ONION PANCAKE. I don't know if I'm just spoiled and have had sensational Taiwanese food, but this wasn't all that great for me. I feel like this dish should be jam packed with green onions. Instead it was mostly thinly friend batter and a slightly too greasy for my liking. Maybe we just got a poorly made one but either way that kind of made me sad. The taste was okay and I appreciate that they serve it with soy saucy sauce and chili sauce.

SERVICE: Our server was very kind and friendly. He did his best to put up with our loud group of gigglers and I appreciate that."}
{"text":"Just not the same taste as the Rose Tea in Squirrel Hill. We always get the fried pork chop rice, but the one on Craig st is less crispy and the seasoning is a bit lacking. The rice is different too (sort of like a friend rice but not really), and instead of pickled cabbage and carrots, you get a mix of frozen/canned corn and peas or something. 

Will stick with the one in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"Still so so good. We almost always bring out-of-town guests here, since Taiwanese food is hard to find sometimes. 

It's become very popular lately though, so sometimes there is a long wait for a table. 

Food comes out really fast though, especially if you get the fried pork chop rice, which I might add to my \"last meal on earth\" list. 

Boba Tea is still good; I tried the lemon tea with boba recently and it's pretty good too, but on the tarter side."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love bubble tea!"}
{"text":"This review is for the boba milk tea drinks only:

The jasmine green milk tea and (black) milk tea were pretty good! Asked for mine 75% sweet because usually boba makes the drink sweeter, but no, not here. The boba balls at Rose Tea aren't sweet at all. They don't taste like anything, just chewy. They gave us generous portions of boba (thank you) but that ended up feeling like undigested little balls of (expanding) rubber in my tummy :(

The ladies behind the counter are sweet and service was great, though!"}
{"text":"Great portion of food. Awesome food, cheap price. You should give a try. The bubble teas are also good."}
{"text":"The best bubble tea in Pittsburgh!  I like how the bubble teas have just the right amount of sugar (some places tend to make it so sweet that I'm dizzy afterwards)."}
{"text":"The food is tasty, but so much MSG!  I'm usually not very sensitive to MSG, but man you can really feel it after you eat here!"}
{"text":"I've been to Rose Tea several times in the last three years, tried a variety of the food on the menu, but I've never been a huge fan. Came back here again last night because the boyfriend sprained his toe so we are eating whatever he wants to eat. After giving Rose Tea another chance, I'll admit I'm glad I did. It's a small, busy Taiwanese restaurant. We went for dinner on a Sunday night at 6:30pm and had to wait 10 minutes before being seated. Ordered the deep fried salt & pepper squid (a bit too salty, but still good that we ate most of it) and the short ribs w eggplant (very good, although I didn't try the eggplant). He got the lychee green tea (which he loved but I thought was too sweet) and I got the black milk tea w wheat germ (which I loved but he thought was just good, not great). Portions are great; these two dishes were more than enough for two people. The lady who took our order was friendly and adorable. She tried to squeeze behind me a couple times during the meal and joked in Mandarin that she needed to lose weight (she doesn't!). This was probably my best experience here in terms of food. Their bubble teas have always been good. 

Given my precious experiences here, I'm not sure if I would give it an overall rating of 3 or 4; 3.5 seems about right. This experience alone though was probably a 4. 

Taste | 4
Atmosphere | 3
Presentation | 3
Service | 3.5
OVERALL | 3.5"}
{"text":"To echo some of the previous reviews, the service here is horrible. I still cringe thinking about my interaction with the elderly male waiter. I came in around 1:30p to the empty restaurant/cafe and was insulted for wanting to order bubble tea (seems that other costumers have been chased away for not wanting food). The waiter told me \"this is a business\" as if to suggest that boba shops and coffee shops aren't businesses if they don't serve food. The server's arrogance was truly appalling and I am shocked that the food here is good enough to compensate for the awful service. Customers should not feel embarrassed for ordering what they want off the menu. Shut it down."}
{"text":"Stopped in here spur of the moment on a Saturday afternoon. It was crowded & tables are limited, but she said \"5 minute wait\" & she was right. It's a good sign in any Asian restaurant that the food is good if the clientele is 95% Asian. In fact aside from myself, the only non-Asian people coming in were grabbing bubble tea to go. And, their mango bubble milk tea was delicious! I had seafood chow fun & the sauce was light & tasty. The noodles were perfect & it was packed with mussels, shrimp, scallops & squid. The others in my party all enjoyed their dishes as well. Veggies were fresh & meats were tender. Not to mention none of our dishes cost over $8.95 and they were HUGE portions. I was the only non-Asian in my party of 4, and my relatives were in from Chicago & we all agreed we would definitely eat here again. The food here is Taiwanese, not Cantonese so dishes vary slightly. Their beef stew over rice with gravy looked fantastic, it's on their $7.95 specials menu & comes with tons of tender beef, veggies & an egg and a double serving of white rice. Try it if you're strolling down Forbes Ave in Squirrel Hill, especially if Everyday Noodles across the street is too crowded."}
{"text":"Meh is the best way to describe my experience. Maybe I've just been too spoiled with all the Taiwanese choices in the Washington D.C. area...

My bubble tea was bland, the beef noodle soup wasn't very flavorful, parking was a pain, my boyfriend ordered something supposedly pretty authentic and it didn't come out as expected, and our waiter seemed just a tad rude. On top of all that, this place has got to have the longest menu I've ever seen, and I've seen endless ones at other Asian-restaurants.

Points though for serving hard-to-find fried, stinky tofu and generous portions. Nothing tasted completely satisfying but I was definitely full."}
{"text":"I happened upon this place when I was out shopping in the area. The sign said they opened at eleven, so I went in around 11:15 to get some boba.

I walked in and the guy behind the counter ignored me. Everyone ignored me. I looked over the menu but he just pretended like I didn't exist and went about his business. Finally I told him I was ready and he said they didn't have any tapioca ready. I asked how long. \"Long time. At least 45 minutes.\"

What? How can you say you are open at eleven if you can't serve your primary product until an hour later? Either prep earlier or open later. What a joke."}
{"text":"Since our last visit, we have been back twice. One time was ok but another time was very good. We took a friend from CA and he really likes the place."}
{"text":"We really like the food at this place, and my Chinese friends tell me that the food is closer to authentic than many. I'm a fan of their chicken and veggie dishes. The prices are right, and the portions are large.

However, it is really small so at busy times it feels crowded like they've jammed about 4 too many tables in there. Also, the uneven service during peak times can add to the feelings of chaos."}
{"text":"The food is good. The milk tea is also very good. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place when I was growing up. It was always such a great place to grab a family-style, Taiwanese meal with friends. Unfortunately, I think their business has gone down considerably since when I used to go 5-6 years ago. I went the other night and ordered one of their quick dinner combo plates (lobster and shrimp) that came with a side of vegetables and rice. The lobster and shrimp portion was a confusing stew that tasted like MSG. I'm exaggerating, but I wasn't impressed. And the vegetable part was this really sad portion of canned corn. The food was NOT okay. Of course, I definitely did not order the right dish - my parents used to order their special dishes, but at the time, I was eating on-the-go by myself, and did not have time to sit down and eat several dishes. Also, I didn't know this, but they don't accept card for purchases under $15, and my dish was less than $10. Luckily, the manager let me slide, but that policy is pretty annoying, especially considering that they are located right next to a college campus (which college kid who wants to grab a meal on-the-go carries cash anymore?)."}
{"text":"I haven't been able to find a replacement for Taiwanese food here in the city as of yet (maybe I'm not trying hard enough?). I remember Rose Tea back when it was just a bubble tea and small plates place with tacky decorations in bright primary colors. Thank goodness for the improvement in decor and expansion of the menu! Every time I came to Rose Tea I'd leave on the verge of exploding (and then of course I'd head over to Rita's or Coldstone). My favorite dishes: their fried rice, lo mein, shredded beef with hot peppers, pork with baby bamboo shoots, and taiwanese stir fried rice cake. Fantastic bubble tea as well, especially the green tea with milk. Only complaint is that I'm not a big fan of the owner lady - she was always very rude and curt (see review for Lulu's)."}
{"text":"I've heard of this place before but haven't really frequented Squirrel Hill until recently. Never had Taiwanese food so I unfortunately don't have much to compare it to. 

The gentleman waiter was friendly enough when we first got there. Helped my friend pick out a new dish and it was fantastic. We split the vegetable rice noodles and the chicken with Chinese hot pepper. I'm glad he ordered what he did because my noodles were just okay. But together, they made a great meal. The chicken was incredibly flavorful. 

After our meal was finished a woman, I'm assuming the owner? stopped by to chat. She was so friendly and appreciated our positive feedback. 

Definitely give this place a try. Had my friend not been a fan I may not have ever stopped in. It's an unassuming place, simple and plain interior."}
{"text":"My sons and I eat here about 3 times a month.  Love the food and love the consistency. The assortment of fun drinks to choose from and the service make it special as well. We are amazed at the quick service. I have tried allot of items on the menu and agree with what the other reviewers said about their choices."}
{"text":"This is one of the very few places I would take my parents to eat if they came to visit me in Pittsburgh.  The food is authentic Taiwanese fare and sooo delicious.  Honestly, it is one of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever had a meal at (and coming from someone who has lived in Seattle and visited Vancouver B.C., this is quite a compliment).  Please do yourself a favor and do not order any of the of typical American-Chinese food (I'm not even sure if they have it because I did not go looking for it) and instead try the Basil Squid or Garlic Eggplant.  The portions are decent and the prices are very reasonable.  Last time my sister and I went we paid around 40 bucks total, which included soup, a seafood dish, a veggie dish, and a generous tip.  Unfortunately the restaurant is on the small side so on a Friday or Saturday night it can get crowded, but don't get discouraged!  Your tastebuds will thank you."}
{"text":"I only come here when I'm closer to this one than the other Rose Tea Cafe in Squirrel Hill. If it was not for the location, I would never come here. 

The service is awful even when there are barely any other customers. The main owner, a middle aged man who is always there during the day, will take his sweet time to wash dishes when there is a line of people waiting to go. I understand you need to get to the dishes and other tasks but where are your priorities? I've worked in the food and retail industry before and if I saw a customer waiting, I would take off my gloves and go help her. The owner even had the audacity to snatch the money out of my hand and throw my change on the counter. Oh, did I mention he will obviously glare at you if you ask one of his servers to help you since he's taking freaking forever! This isn't the first time it has happened. I've been here three times and on all occasions the same guy had the nastiest attitude. 

Second, we ran into a couple of my boyfriend's colleagues at this cafe and they were not allowed to dine in because the only table available was a three-seater not a two-seater even though it was super tiny. The owner was planning on squeezing three people at that tiny table? how? I'm petite and I even felt uncomfortable thinking about how cramped I would be with two other people. After some haggling, they were able to sit down. How cheap and transparent can they be? 

The only good thing about this place is the boba/pearl drinks are consistent with their other location."}
{"text":"Just moved to Pittsburgh from SoCal and was in desperate need of some Boba (pearl tea, bubbles, whatever they call it here) and Rose Tea Cafe is close by so why not.

I've tried all the tea spots in Pittsburgh so far and Rose Tea Cafe is the best. The best here, I mean. Definitely not comparable to California and Taiwan. Their drinks are average and taste a little powdery, but will do for now until I move back to Boba heaven. Also, they have a lot of variety. I am able to order peach green tea, which I cannot easily find at other boba establishments here.
 
Service is below average. After going here about five times now, I have to agree with other reviews that they do not acknowledge you and sometimes you can catch the stink eye. This might be confusing if it's your first time there because you don't know if you should stand at the door or go all the way to the counter. I don't take it personally since I'm desperate for that boba. Just walk to the counter, wait for the ladies to stop ignoring you, order your drink, and go.They make the drinks pretty quick so that's nice. I've never dined in but the menu looks great and the place does get packed so will have to do one day. 

All in all, if you're in need of a boba/pearl fix in Pittsburgh and are not too snobbish about how the tea is made, Rose Tea Cafe is for you.

++ Nothing to do with the cafe, but street parking can become a little difficult during the day and during normal rush hours. Also, there's a small parking lot for all the establishments behind the Dunkin Donuts. Remember to pay at the parking meters."}
{"text":"Superb! 

Placed a delivery order for shrimp lo mein and chicken fried rice for my boyfriend. The lo mein was awesome! So flavorful, and they give you large portions. My boyfriend liked his fried rice. Will definitely order or go to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I want to give Rose Tea Cafe a 5 but the service really really stinks. I felt uncomfortable even ordering bubble teas to go because I got the stinkeye from the staff. I've been here twice now and can confirm that the elderly man who serves as the waiter is not only unfriendly, but downright rude and intimidating. A small eatery who serves bubble teas should allow their customers to order them to go and display their drink menu someone visible...like, on the wall, maybe. 

No, here is what they do. You walk into the cramped (otherwise cozy) restaurant. Said grumpy waiter shoves you a menu wordlessly and you end up sitting down at a table. Then I'm handed a mason jar of water and the grumpy waiter impatiently asks what I'm ordering. I'm dazed because I just want to order a bubble tea and be on my way. I awkwardly stand up and explain that I just want to order a drink to go. He has the NERVE to appear angry at me and snatches the menus out of the way. When I go up to the counter to order, there are no menus! WTF, Rose Tea Cafe? 

Now, I did go here to eat as well on another trip and that was a lot less awkward but still had the same exact horrible service. The food here is great. The prices for the specials and bubble tea is very reasonable too. The prices for the regular dishes is pretty high for such a small eatery and lack of nicer plates/silverware though. I recognized many authentic Taiwanese meals and the flavors were superb. The marinated egg is excellent. It's such a shame because I would come here quite often if it were not for that one mean, mean man! Can he just work in the back so he doesn't have to talk to customers? Yeesh! Not even a smile or acknowledgement as you enter or leave the place! My friend asked him a question about the curry chicken and he just stared at her. He is just awful."}
{"text":"I came back here last Friday and tried their Taiwanese Chunk Chicken. Sure, alot of dishes out there have basils and chili peppers, but this dish really shows that it's all about the cooking technique and what time and degrees does to an ingredient. The chicken has incredible flavor in its brown sauce without being overly salty. The soft garlic morsels are caramalized and delicious. The chicken is not tossed in anything but is thinly crunchy on the outside and are bursting juices when you bite into it. I highly recommend an all vegetable dish with this one because it is a large load of salty meat that needs to be counteracted with healthy greens. This is definitely a dish I haven't had anywhere else in the city. Most of the chinese/panasian restaurants seem to cater to american flavor by pouring ingredients, salts, and fats carelessly onto the stove to come up with a generic, likable taste. But in the food, special ingredients, and presentation of all their dishes, the slight nuances of Taiwanese cooking really shows through at Rose Tea."}
{"text":"Great drinks, tasty food, fast delivery. A few of my faves include the scallion pancake with egg, fried dumplings and the taro milk tea"}
{"text":"Great food. Probably the best Taiwanese cuisine in the birth!!! Employees are great except this one lady at the cashier. I think she might be the owner."}
{"text":"if you REALLY want some chinese food and REALLY got no escape to chinatown.. then rose tea is your place...  i've def had better chinese food than here.. but it'll do for pittsburgh esp since its close to campus.  i wish they put more veggies in their platters tho.. like the taiwanese chunk chicken is literally just chicken.. and of course paying an extra 10 bucks for veggies is just not worth it.. so yea... it will do, it will do ---- the sad part is that for what you're gonna pay at rose tea... you might as well just treat yourself to like mccormicks and schmicks or something.. i think it's pricey for chinese food"}
{"text":"We needed a place to eat before heading back on a Sunday morning coming down. All of the breakfast places in Squirrel Hill were at capacity. We walked down the street and stumbled into Rose Tea Cafe. The server was a friendly guy who was able to point us in the right direction. The chunk chicken that my buddy ordered was delicious. It was very similar to a Thai basil chicken dish but with chunked up chicken instead of ground up. I appreciate the word \"chunk\" so that was an added bonus. It also made me think of the Houston, TX slang of \"chunk up the deuce\" which means to throw a peace sign to somebody. I ordered a bone in pork chop over rice. It had a sweet BBQ-like sauce that was not bad. I was trying to keep my cost low at around $9 because there is a $15 credit card minimum."}
{"text":"I might have an addiction to the beef and broccoli w/ black pepper sauce...."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in all of Pittsburgh!

My favorite is their string beans with garlic sauce and on the last time I was there, it was sold out (I blatantly stared at the table who got the last of it). I also like their sauteed sliced pork with leeks and filet fish with black bean sauce (very tender fish).

Tawainese food is different from typical Chinese food if you ever eat more than just delivery/takeout Chinese food. I really liked the taste of it and we always finished every last morsel of our food. 

The place is a little small so you may have to wait a bit to get a spot but it's worth it.

We usually parked in a lot behind Dunkin Donuts, which cost a small fee but I am horrible at parallel parking so it worked for me."}
{"text":"The food was great! We had the steamed dumplings, scallion pancake with beef, and the shrimp lo mein."}
{"text":"Very good cooking.  I'm not familiar with Taiwanese fare but from the two times I've been there the chef does a good job with both meats and vegetables.  The menu is 75% hot/spicy for those faint of heart, flavors are strong but balanced.  I've eaten many styles of Chinese foods in the past and this style is very different but still very good.  My reservation of giving them a 5th star is not knowing the menu but I have time to tour the other items and then I'll update this review.  I had the Country Spare Ribs (because the \"motherland\" couple next to me ordered it) it was terrific."}
{"text":"They usually have amazing bubble tea but my last experience there the tapioca pearls were kind of hard recently they got a consumer alert from the health department see link below.

{"text":"Note: this 5-star review is for the bubble tea only


Okay listen up Yelpers. The bubble tea you will be lucky enough to encounter at this establishment is the tried-and-true BEST bubble tea in this entire damn city. The tea itself is a bit sweet, be prepared, but nothing over the top (I always go for the leechee green tea), but the real kicker is the bubbles, which are not only always cooked to perfection, but are also given to you in the appropriate quantity so that you don't run out of tea/bubbles.

The only other thing I have had at Rose Tea is the egg drop soup, which has pieces of corn and is decently delicious.

But mostly...BUBBLE TEA"}
{"text":"My lady friend and I were excited to try this place as some feel it is one of the best spots in the Squirrel. Unfortunately, there were very few bright spots in our meal. The prices bordered on outrageous and although the portions were adequate, the flavor of everything we ate just seemed slightly off.  The Taiwanese Chunk Chicken was texturally pleasing but after the first few bites, it tasted like the chef had used far too much fennel or anise (maybe both).  My date ordered the seafood kimchi and although the dish came with its own flaming mini-sterno, the seafood did not taste fresh and was mixed awkwardly with  bland tofu.  The server was charming to a degree but overall, we both left dissapointed with the meal, the bubble tea, and the number at the bottom of our bill."}
{"text":"Its been over 2 years since I have been at this place. I bragged about this place all the time to people visiting in Pittsburgh. I was craving the stinky tofu here and of course since boba runs in my veins, I had to come back and visit. The food was even better than i remembered but I removed stars for the service. 

I decided to go with stinky tofu appetizer, the shredded pork and bamboo shoots stir fry, hollow stem vegetable with garlic, and a hot black milk tea with boba. He asked me if I wanted hot or cold and I specifically said \"hot.\" The server also called hollow stem vegetable as watercress, which i then asked him in chinese just to make sure I had ordered the right vegetable. In hind sight, I should have corrected him and let him know that watercress is NOT hollow stem. Perhaps he needed more training, but thank goodness I spoke Chinese and knew what I wanted. 

A few things wrong, the server brought my bubble tea and it was cold. She said the server was new and didn't write if I wanted hot or cold. I said I had ordered hot. But then I told her that I would still take the cold drink since its already made, I had been waiting and was super thirsty anyways. The food came out in good timing. The stinky tofu changed slightly from what I remembered. Last time the sauce was sweet. This time, the sauce and fermented cabbage was spicy, which is better this way! I liked this change of flavor. The pork and bamboo was delicious, with very tender bamboo. Lastly, the hollow stem vegetable was non-greasy and lightly seasoned to my liking. After a few sips of my milk tea, it was quite cold at the table by the window so I asked my server if I could swap my cold milk tea back to a hot milk tea since I realized me accepting their mistake was a mistake of my own. He comes back and says that I couldn't since I had already taken a few sips. At this time, I was a bit disappointed with the service so I said I will just pay for a hot one then. 

At time of payment, I expressed my disappointment and what happened with the front lady but nothing was done. I packed the rest of my food and left. While my tummy was full and satisfied, I left with a slight bitterness."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY.

Didn't like the place. The service is either rude or friendly depending on your server. The food costs too much for mediocre quality; the real Rose Tea Cafe in Squirrel Hill is much better. 

I had the marinated pork over rice;  it is essentially chopped pork, rice, and a boiled egg. The meal was far too salty and I didn't like it very much.

The server recommended the Taro bubble tea, which was \"very very popular.\" They are supposed to have a rich, creamy texture but the one I had was very watery and not sweet. I'll regard this as a anomaly, but overall the experience wasn't worth the cost."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. 

I have a very hard time veering away from my old standbys the stir fried rice cakes and the sweet and sour pork, but I have to try new things and this past weekend that was the Taiwanese chunk chicken which was out of this world delicious! I loved it and is taking the second ranking in favorites, though I do have to say that the stir fried rice cakes are number one!

I also love their bubble tea especially the kumquat lime which is a favorite of my future brother in laws and the one that he turned me on to and is now my favorite! 

Go here and go often because the menu is huge and it is all delicious!"}
{"text":"Portions for the main dishes are a little on the small end but one of the best Asian restaurants in Pittsburgh. I ordered the special pork chop dish off the Chinese menu

The eggplant beef, salt and pepper fried squid, ong choy, and king oyster mushroom were all good but the star of the night was the special pork chop dish ordered off the Chinese menu on the white board. It was authentic crispy Taiwanese \"jiao ma pai gu\" ?? with some chopped spicy pepper and cilantro on top. It's not traditional fried pork because it's breaded with a crunchy exterior that resembles crushed almond texture. 

The main dishes all come with rice and the service was great!"}
{"text":"The last time I went there they had a minimum order for occupying their seats, which meant that we had to find somewhere else to drink the bubble tea. Not too wild about that. In fact, that's why it's also the 'last' time I'll go there. I can get the same thing at their Squirrel Hill location, which is better in every conceivable way."}
{"text":"The good news is that the boba tea is still quite tasty. The bad news is that the food was fairly mediocre, and for what you get, a bit pricey. I'd still recommend it for bubble tea though. The service could be a bit better."}
{"text":"I don't know if I should owe my friend for taking me here or be mad at him. I'm addicted now. Addicted to bubble tea!!

Can you believe I've never had it before? I've had Thai iced tea, which I absolutely love, but never Bubble Tea. Dear Lord was I missing out! All this time... wasted.

I haven't even eaten here yet, but I'll be stopping back for their delicious tea. I ordered the coconut one, but I spied many many other flavors I wanted to try. There's even smoothies and milkshakes. I could spend months going through their drink menu alone.

Maybe I'll even eat here next time... stay tuned!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Rose Tea Caf√©, I went with my friend after finals to just get bubble tea. We sat down and the old man came over to us and put warm water in jars on the table without saying anything to us. He then came over 15 minutes later and asked us what we would like. We ordered our tea and he told us there was a 5 dollar minimum (which was stated on the very back of the menu). We decided to not leave and go to the place across the street and ordered food. I ordered marinated \"pork\" over rice and instead got sloppy joe meat, mixed frozen vegetables, and poorly cooked rice. Instead of complaining about the food, I paid for it. We walked out without leaving tip due to terrible food, service, and drinks. As we were walking  out, one lady chased us out and told us we had to leave a tip. Keep in mind that our server was sitting in the back, never talked to us, and never came to check on us. This was disappointing overall, and the people were so rude. Never again."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I crave pan-fried noodles! The portions are large enough that we can easily share the noodles and dumplings and still take food home!  The dumplings are made in-house and are a great value--last time, we got eleven dumplings in our order! 

For take-out, the fried noodles were packaged separately from the sauce, veggies, and meat, so they stay crispy!"}
{"text":"Pork chop plate: YUM! Comes with a mound of rice with some sort of sauce on top, a hard boiled egg, and tasty pickled cabbage and carrots. $8 cheapest thing we ordered and best thing we had

Taiwanese chunk chicken: gingery, star anise-y, Chinese 5-spice-ish. Not spicy at all. Decent. Comes out sizzling. Not worth $13 IMO.

Mapo Bean Curd: this is my usual pick for Chinese/Taiwanese restos. Huge portion but meh. This is usually spicy! Why y'all holdin out on spice??? Cost $10 I think.

The last page of the menu has a list of personal dishes and are super cheap for the amount of food you get.

FAST and friendly service. Tiny restaurant, hard to find parking."}
{"text":"My Chinese friend (a CMU student) recommended this place for it's bubble tea and noodles, after I told her that I'll spend July 4th weekend in Pittsburgh. Awesome place, they serve a variety of dishes to satisfy everyone. For my meat lover boyfriend, they have Shredded Beef (a lot of meat), and I love noodles so I got Seafood Noodle Soup. Service is nice and fast, and the original bubble tea is great!


My Order:
Vegetable Spring Roll
Marinated Eggs
Seafood Noodle Soup
Shredded Beef W. Chinese Hot Pepper
Original Bubble Tea"}
{"text":"Very good bubble milk tea. I would like to see Thai ice tea and sesame bubble milk added to the menu, but still VERY good!"}
{"text":"I have been here one time ad was in a hurry. I only ordered bubble tea. Superior to Lu Lu's Noodles. I grabbed a menu and definately plan on returning so long as I can find a place to park."}
{"text":"Very reasonable prices.  Fast friendly service.  Huge menu.  Home made noodles and fresh, well prepared ingredients.  Absolutely delicious asian food, one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Rose Tea's gone even more downhill since the last time I've reviewed it (is that even possible?)  my last visit to Rose Tea was around two weeks ago and it was only because Chaya was closed for the week (we found out AFTER we got to Chaya's front steps).

Food just isn't good anymore.  I got their braised pork belly b/c well, I love pork belly and it's pretty damn hard to mess up.  It tasted as if the pork belly was boiled in water and then topped with the \"braising liquid\".  Come to think of it, everything kinda tastes like the ingredients are all precooked and then thrown together like they do at Orient Express.

My expectations as a whole weren't high to begin with after the years of quality deterioration, but come on Rose Tea, don't break my heart like that, I bruise like a peach..."}
{"text":"The beef chow fun is supposed to be dry but the way they made it had some gravy on it.  It wasn't a lot of gravvy but it's more than the way it should be.  Their mango bubble tea flavor was weak.  All the dishes we ordered  tasted good, nothing wrong with eating here.  However, it isn't a place that I would want to come back soon because in Pittsburgh, there are a lot of other places to eat."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE Rose Tea Cafe.  The best dumplings and bobo tea in the 'burgh!  I've been searching high and low for the perfect iced bobo tea and dumplings and Rose Tea comes the closest yet.

The tea:
Pros:  REAL brewed black tea, consistently good bobo, good flavor, not too sweet.

Cons:  A bit pricely ($3.50 for a small)

I'm a little bit obsessed with finding the perfect iced bobo tea.  I look for 4 things:
1) Real brewed black tea
2) Properly cooked Bobo (firm, but not hard center)
3) Good flavoring
4) Balance (right amount of ice, Bobo, milk/tea)

1)  Tea is consistently delicious.
2)  Usually perfect- a bit firm in the center!
3)  Liquid flavors
4)  Good amount of ice, tea, milk (powdered), bobo.  They use a shaker which really makes all the difference.  Very consistent product!

The dumplings are SUPER fresh, with hand-made wrappers. Also, the portion is great for the price - 8 for $4.50!

My fiance and I got to Rose Tea a lot.  The only major disappointments are the specials on the front of the menu, which are consistently bad.  They also like to rush people out.

Highlights - Taiwanese chunk chicken, sauteed string beans, pan-fried noodles!"}
{"text":"Lets face it - Pittsburgh does not have much in the way of Asian food, in general, minus the very generic, run of the mill cheap Chinese joints that all serve the same tasting, grease laden junk. Rose Tea Cafe serves great homemade tasting food, that really stands out here. I am very fond of their hotpots - a true delight, especially on a cold day. All the ingredients/vegetables that I have had from here have been fresh and of good quality. They have a large menu, with plenty of standard fare from typical American Asian restaurants. Be careful of the stinky tofu, though, if you are brave enough to try it. The smells is truly...stinky...."}
{"text":"Living in New York City, it's actually quite difficult to get good Taiwanese food. There are only a few select spots and and most of them are in Flushing or in New Jersey. Yikes. Rose Tea Cafe blows most of these spots out of the water. Most of the Taiwanese specialty dishes here are done very well, like the Taiwanese Chunk Chicken (Three Cup Chicken) which comes out sizzling in a clay pot and with tons of garlic and basil. The shredded pork with bamboo, salt and pepper pork, and the ganbian string beans are also my go-to dishes here too. The portions are great, and I usually always end up bringing extra food home.

I'm a fan of the lunch specials as well, and at those prices ($5-7), definitely a steal. My favorite is the pork chop over rice with a hard boiled tea egg. Pretty much everything is better with that tea egg. Definitely a good value if you want a hearty, high-quality meal on a college student's budget. 

The milk teas and the smoothies are always better here, definitely better than Orient Express or Lulu's Noodles, likely because the ingredients are fresher and I just feel that they have more experience making these great drinks. I never really drink bubble tea anymore, but in all the years I've been going to Rose Tea, it has never disappointed.

Service is actually pretty good here, minus the actual seating part. The host/hostess always struggles with seating people efficiently, but the actual waitstaff is always pretty friendly and attentive, something that isn't common among some Asian restaurants. Service can become a little spotty when it's super busy, but it's never been enough to ruin our experience.

Overall, Rose Tea is a place that you'll see a lot of Taiwanese students/patrons at, and I think that's a testament to their authenticity and quality. The food, drinks, and better-than-average service should keep you coming back for more."}
{"text":"I have ate in here twice and to go once. Bubble tea and food were pricey yet decent. Staff was very off-putting both times and down right mean when I called back because they forgot something in my Togo order. Might not be back."}
{"text":"The service speed is normal and the waiters are very friendly. The food is a little more expensive than usual Chinese food, but the taste is pretty good. I would most likely come here again."}
{"text":"I was in search of some Asian food while walking around the campus.  So I saw an Asian walking towards me with a bento box and a boba tea... So I thought to myself; \"I think there must be some Taiwanese food straight ahead.\"  Short moment later, I saw another one in the same attire.  That confirmed my intuition that I must be in the right path towards some Asian food.  As I continue to walk; two more Asian with boba tea!  That confirmed there must be some Taiwanese/Asian food close by. Surely enough, I found the restaurant! 

I ordered black pepper beef with noodles.  For $10.00... I'm not sure it's exactly worth the money.  There's literally 6 pieces of meat and one piece of green onion tossed with spaghetti in a pre made black pepper sauce.  Come on... If you're going to claim yourself as Taiwanese food; at least toss it with Taiwanese type of noodles.  

The bowl surely fills your tummy, but can probably get better food elsewhere for the same price"}
{"text":"I just signed up for yelp solely so that I could warn you all. I hate to do this but honestly- what is going on there? Has management changed? Maybe I ordered wrong- and so did my friend- and so did we both with the app- but everything tasted like a chopped challenge where the task was to make a \"fancy dinner\" with cafeteria food. 

Started with corn chicken soup for two-not even terrible, but bland af and honestly not even as flavorful as the straight up chicken broth I sometimes have for dinner when I plan to wear something skintight but accidentally ate a whole pizza and twelve beers for lunch. 

Both of us ordered off the back page of the menu which I would imagine is similar to backpage the website in terms of quality. I ordered shrimp in lobster sauce which is like ordering a stripper named Chanel. Cheap and ends in remorse. This beauty came with canned, prob microwaved cafeteria veg medley, bland warmed up baby shrimp and \"lobster sauce\" less aptly named than Apple Jacks. And way less nutritious. Probably a cream of something(?) can of soup I swear to god.

Friend had pork belly- also off ironically located and named backpage of the menu. He didn't eat it. He eats anything. For example, he dated me.  Rice was edible because it was rice and probably the only thing not canned and microwaved.

In their defense the menu is HUGE (yuge) so maybe there are some things that are not so cheap and bad. We just didn't order them.

Anyway I came here starving. Anything should have tasted good. But instead I left angry that I wasted money and calories on canned cafeteria food I could have made better at home. We got a frozen pizza and obvs stopped at the liquor store on the way home. 

Nice waiter good luck to him!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a take away but had to wait for full 30 mins before I got it. Apparently, 2 batches of customers came and went away during that time. Very slow service, crude employees and I wasted a lot of time. Don't even wanna review the dish..."}
