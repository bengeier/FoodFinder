{"text":"Service is good 6 oz steak plain and tiny the size of a golf ball not worth the 23 bucks"}
{"text":"One of our go to spots. Love Cajun chicken, hunan and the dynamite rolls.  Good value choice when going out."}
{"text":"Nice addition to 130th they have a decent sized patio that's covered with heaters. The waiting area also has a good amount of comfy seating. It can get pretty busy because of the amount of people in the area so be prepared to wait. Large bar though which if you're not dining with kids is your better bet. Staff are friendly each time I've been in."}
