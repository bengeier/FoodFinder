{"text":"This place is legit ! I've had the sesame chicken , lemon chicken which is made different , sweet n sour pork , and egg rolls all delicious"}
{"text":"I liked the original crew that worked here when the place first opened.  The food is satisfactory but nothing compares to the chinese food joint I frequented in college.  The texture and taste of the beef is off.  I would go here again because of convenience but not my first choice since I found another place with better meat texture and taste."}
{"text":"I have ordered multiple meals, and the food is delicious and fairly inexpensive. Delivery is convenient and always delivered in a timely manner. The fried rice is as good as any where else and the lettuce wraps are delicious. My one complaint is that they do not give you enough lettuce with the wraps. This has been an issue every time that I have gotten them. The wraps always comes with an order of rice, which makes for a nice substitute when you run out of lettuce. I love their boba Thai milk tea. It is always cool and refreshing. And I appreciate the free egg rolls that are included in pretty much every order."}
{"text":"This is my second time going to this place in a week. It is really good... The best Chinese food in Henderson. I used to go to China go go because it was closer to my house but the quality has gone so down hill. I am so glad that I have found this place. Their lunch special is really reasonably priced. I am excited to try more on their menu!"}
{"text":"Done with this place! We used to love it and ordered quite often both for carry-out and delivery. The quality has gone down and delivery takes forever. Every time we order, no matter what time of day it is, it takes 50min. We live 2 min away!

I am allergic to onions, especially green onions, and every time I order beef with broccoli by delivery they get it wrong. Just now I called and asked 2 separate people if I could get wonton soup with Dinner A. I am not feeling well and that is all I want, I don't care if I have to pay extra. Both people told me yes I could get it. I finalize my order and 40 min later I get a call telling me that wonton is not available with Dinner A unless I pay more. I explained to the guy that I asked that over the phone, was told it was OK, and was not charged extra. He told me I had pay the driver $2 extra..... I don't have cash on me. I told him to cancel my order and he told me NO you pay $2 to driver. 60 minutes after my call my food arrived and I had to give him $2 in pennies and nickels. 

Next time I want Chinese I will find a new place or just stick it up and go to Panda."}
{"text":"Very delicious, I had veggie Fried rice and they made it to order which I love because I dint like all the veggies  overall a great place to stop and grab some food in the way home or after a night of being out late"}
{"text":"First thing I noticed was the restaurant was very clean and the staff was very attentive. I got the #19 Combination Chow Mein which tasted great.  I also tried their Mango Bobs which was delicious. Definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"I have been driving by this place for weeks now and finally I got to try this place out last night! I am so happy there's finally a great Chinese restaurant close by me. I ordered the salt and pepper chicken, shrimp pad Thai, and their Szechwan beef! It was delicious! The pad Thai was not as good as real pad Thai, but it was good enough to fill my expectations.  The place was very small but intimate. I like how you can see the chefs cooking your food and they have boba's!!! They also have lunch specials which is priced very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Decent Chinese place. I suggest the lunch special, you honestly can't go wrong with the price & amount. One thing, they always forget the sweet and sour sauce with the spring rolls !!"}
{"text":"Love the food and service! Addicted to the orange chicken and fried rice but also enjoy the Hong Kong Crispy Noodles, General Tao's.  We enjoy the quality and the price. Especially the lunch specials!"}
{"text":"The food is okay, but the service really is disappointing, so disappointing I'll just give the food back and I got it delivered. Why does it takes 15 minutes, asking the gate code to my house? That's like getting lost in a dead in? Then food was cold and they fuck up on my order and I ordered online. First time and last time very disappointed"}
{"text":"Small Place but nice and clean they have an extensive menu with good variety first time here and not disappointed prices are accessible so def will come back"}
{"text":"The food is good, and they actually pay attention when you ask for something different or a special order. We have been here several times were never disappointed. The staff is super friendly. Great Neighborhood Place."}
{"text":"My family loves eating at China Wan Wan.  Whether we are getting to-go, delivery or eating in they always remember us and are very nice.  We love the food, the war won ton soup is the best we have ever had!!  Just love the freshness and they definitely don't skimp on the veggies! A must eat when we have Chinese."}
{"text":"I was sick for 2 days after eating from this restaurant. Never again. The food was delivered about an hour after I ordered it and it was barely warm.  I ordered a chicken entree, a noodle entree and egg rolls. The egg rolls were good. The rest of the food was average and they use a lot of large pieces of garlic in their dishes. Not even an hour later I was very sick with stomach problems. It took me 2 days to feel better after I ate from here. I'll stick with my usual Chinese spot from now on."}
{"text":"Super fast, big portions, great food!  And they even have pad Thai...yummy pad Thai.  Also tried the sesame chicken, crab Rangoon, beef and broccoli - all good!!"}
{"text":"The lunch specials are the best! Good amount of everything: chow mein, fried rice, main dish (of your choice) all for less than $7"}
{"text":"This place is great. I choose to review this business for what it is, not what it isn't. 
Everytime I've ordered food for the family I've always been pleased and thankful for the large portions so I can have good leftovers later.  I pickup because the food comes out fast and by the time I leave it's ready when I'm there. Good food, good prices, very friendly staff. 


Reading the reviews I can't help but think how snowflakey and stuckup all y'alls expectations are for any fast food Chinese joint, since when is everything on styrofoam a bad thing. Since when do those places seat you and send a wait staff over. Since when was it EVER expected to be healthy and not greasy, fast food. You people need to get real writing 3 paragraphs about your rich expectations... only to be disappointed there was no valet. I know what to expect from a place like this so I don't have stupid responses like 'where's my pampering?..... 2stars for you then'.  ?

I can't believe I felt compelled to write this long crap but I juuuust caaaant staaaaand idiots that go to a place with high expectations knowing they probably won't be met and then bitch about how regular and normal that business is."}
{"text":"Love the food and service!  Generous portions and so close to my house.  My kids love their fried rice and orange chicken."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had. Everything is fresh made, even pot stickers made fresh. Everything I've eaten here has been fantastic. General tsos chicken is my favorite, Mongolian Beef, noodles, rice, pepper steak, I could go on and on. I won't go anywhere where else again. And great lunch specials."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese restaurant I have ever been to! Everything is always piping hot and super fresh. The staff is so friendly and they remember you when you come in! They can speak Spanish too  we love this place!"}
{"text":"I *LOVE* this place!  It's the best Chinese food in this area/side of town. Seriously.  The food is *always* fresh, hot, and delicious.  Plus side: all their staff are extremely friendly people."}
{"text":"Great food except anything with beef.. the beef is cheap.  But the crispy duck is the best ever and the fried rice and crab Rangoon is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all. There was only one ding.. the drink. The guy filled my cup up with soda and there was tiny things inside the drinks so I just got another. All in all tho it was a good experience. Really good tasting food. I had the black bean fish or something like that and oh boy I would come back for another my daughter has the beef broccoli lunch special she wow! Really good. It's another version of panda express but I'd rather come to this one only because it's freshly made. Oh and the portions oh boy.. what can I say. They fill the whole plate up not leaving any empty spaces like panda express does. The staffs are really friendly as well. Helped me with my choices I wanted to order and prices are on point! I paid 13 for 2 big plates."}
{"text":"I'm really glad this place is just around the corner! Yummy, quality Chinese food ready and fresh in no time. My favorite dishes include: house fried rice, salt and pepper pork chop, and the flat noodles."}
{"text":"Great soup... love there soup. A bit pricey and not sure how authentic the food is... But I got a grub hub discount and that was xool.. .worth it with coupons or codes for sure. Overall good service...jusy s bit pricey."}
{"text":"Finally. A good Chinese place near me!  This reminds me of the Chinese food back east. Def a must go!"}
{"text":"Love that they deliver!  Food is freshly made and good!  Love that they are super friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"I recommend this this place as we really enjoyed it. We placed a large order for delivery, it arrived in the time-frame given, the order was accurate and the food was delicious. Portions were large. We had coupons so they threw in some complimentary items, and didn't even take our coupons. Our out-of-town guests were happy with this dinner choice, we will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"Had an order delivered.  It came as ordered and was hot and very good!  Glad I live in their delivery area for sure!"}
{"text":"Make sure you bring a fan because this place obviously lacks AC. Its almost 90 degrees in here."}
{"text":"Will definitely be back! We stopped in yesterday for lunch and we were not disappointed. 3 of us ate lunch for $23! The food was delicious and flavorful! I think they have the best fried rice in town too! I ordered the lemon chicken, my son ordered the orange chicken and his girlfriend ordered the Mongolian beef. We all loved our food but couldn't finish so we each got 2 meals out of our lunch specials, can't beat that! Very clean, excellent service, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Sit down or carry out Chinese Food. Average taste, pricing and portions. We got Mongo Beef and got Egg rolls comped. Owner had their young  children playing in a booth. Orders were processed quickly. Decor is inviting but nothing here would bring me back every time..."}
{"text":"Yuck. What was that I just ordered. I think this is the worst Chinese food I ever had. The fried rice was very dry and bland. The won ton soup was also bland. The chow mein had a strange orange color and didn't look appetizing. I never saw that before. The pot stickers were overcooked and were a dark brown color and dried out. After a few bites of everything, I threw it out, which was a first for me. What a waste of money. I don't see how this place got four stars unless the people that rated it so never had good Chinese food before, which is hard to find in this area."}
{"text":"This place is not so bad. One of the only places near Sam Boyd with good orange beef. Service was par, But they have delivery, so I suggest eating in. Rice tasted burned the first time. I still drive and pick up little dumplings."}
{"text":"I love their chicken chowmein. Me and my boyfriend went to eat here today. We decided to dine in for the lunch special which includes soup if you dine on only. I didn't recieve my soup. Another party of customers ordered their lunch special as well and they recieved their soup. Saddest part about it is i tipped them. I'll be finding a new chinese place to eat from now on."}
{"text":"This place is great. I haven't eaten there yet as i always have it delivered. we always get the dinner special and they don't disappoint, My wife's favorite is the hot and sour soup which is great but she likes it spicy (im not huge on spicy) the curry noodles are AMAZING! i highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and absolutely outstanding customer service. I ordered food from here today on Christmas day and they delivered. We were missing soup and I called them and they sent it right away, no questions asked. They were so happy in doing so as well. Christmas is really a tough time for us and they made our day with how sweet they were. 

Not to mention the food was absolutely wonderful. I will be ordering from them for now on. Thank you and Merry Christmas!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and most of the time the service is good but it sucks that they don't allow u to buy lunch specials after hours....yes I know its LUNCH specials but one time they said I could buy after hours but the price went up a cpl dollars which was fine. Then next time I ordered they said they don't sell those meals after hours and when I said they did last time they basically said I was lying. So now I go thru China kitchen!"}
{"text":"I order the meal to dine in they made it to go the guy insisted I  order my meal to go which I didn't. They were getting people order confuse. I'm coming back to this place"}
{"text":"Food was ok and the service was HORRIBLE. I went during lunch time. Wasn't busy at all two men were standing at the register and just stared at me as I walked up to them. No greeting no nothing. I felt awkward so I said hi. Still no response so I said ok so no hi. Then one of the guy says order or take out. It wasn't a question... more like a statement. So I say hi again then ordered. It was such a turn off. I probably won't return for the pure simple fact I didn't feel like a valued customer."}
{"text":"This place is 50/50. Some dishes are amazing and some are not really good. Fried wantons and crab rangoons are so good. The black bean fish fillet lunch special is really good to. I was expecting one or two pieces nd I opened it nd there were about 10 pieces. Really good deal. The chow mien nd fried rice is really generic though. It feels like it was frozen. Doesn't taste really good. The hot garlic chicken is also generic, the sauce is really watery nd that's what has the flavor and the chicken and vegetables and drenched into it . I'm guessing other dishes might taste amazing and it was a 50/50 experience. But overall for the price I was satisfied. Definately get the crab rangoons and fried wantons though. I'm going to go back after work just to buy some."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"family dinner A\" with orange chicken and sweet and sour pork as the entrees plus an order of Mongolian beef for delivery through grub hub. It was delivered before expected which is where the good part of this review ends.  The egg rolls and crab rangoon never made it here.  The orange chicken was extremely dry and chewy.  The sweet and sour pork was more fried than it was pork. The Mongolian beef had good flavor but was unfortunately doused in grease and made of chewy meat that seemed like it was all leftover scraps being used up. We don't eat out very often and my family was very let down tonight, especially me, as now I've not only wasted $50 but I have to cook on what should've been a rare night off. DON'T waste your time or money here!!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed and SUPER upset!

FIRST TIME experience an hour ago today. Placed my order for pick-up via GrubHub at 5:19 PM, because their restaurant is available for services through this website, as well as Eat24 apparently.

My husband went to pick up the order at 5:50, since the time stated it would be ready by between 5:45 - 5:55 PM. The food was NOT ready, and they state they never received the order at all, and that this has happened many times in the past with other orders placed with GrubHub, and that he suggested he contact GrubHub at the time and just cancel it so that we can reorder everything at the restaurant and pay with cash. This is irritating, as much as it is an inconvenience. 

If this keeps happening before, FIX it! Had to go to the local Panda Express because we had no time to spend with each other for dinner before my husband leaves for work til 4am if we decided for them to cook our food, and being irritated with them does not help with us patronizing them."}
{"text":"I won't order from them again.  I ordered takeout and got the Moo Goo Gai Pan, some Thai teas, and crab rangoons .  My Moo Goo gain pan was extremely slimy I could not even eat it.  I've had this dish before and it's not supposed to look slimy and taste squishy.  The crab rangoons were good.  Thai tea they used hazelnut creamer."}
{"text":"I just got a delivery from there using YELP EAT for the 1st time.....Both deserve 5 stars.
 I got the War Wonton soup that is a must..
The Pork Chop Suey was EXCELLENT  
2 egg rolls (they taste like egg rolls) 
I will definitely try them again. 
The delivery was insanely fast, I'm not sure how it was even possible? 
I know it's new so I hope they stay consistent because I liked everything about it so far."}
{"text":"Delicious! Finally found a great Chinese food place near my house! I've ordered the last 2 times via YelpEat and they've always delivered earlier than scheduled. Cashew chicken is delicious as well as their fried rice. We've definitely become big fans and will continue returning!"}
{"text":"It was dinner time and I was really hungry. I live literally across the street from it and was always skeptical about this place. But I was craving noodles and this place was open ! I ordered honey walnut shrimp, chow mein and crab Ragoon. I can definitely say that the honey walnut shrimp and crab ragoon was so much better than panda. The noodles are okay. I would definitely be trying more things from the menu. Their price is really good for the price you pay more and that to me is a big factor. They also made our food quite fast, I was shocked at how fast and I thought that it was going to be poorly made but not at all!! More people should give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Sadly, will not return to this restaurant.....

We have frequented this restaurant for a long time (2-3 times a week sometimes). Placed one of our regular orders (salt and pepper chicken wings and singapore style rice noodles). Picked up the order, in a hurry to go watch the olympics. Got home, found the wrong item in the bag, called the restaurant, employee told us to bring it back. Got there and all of a sudden they can't exchange the item even though we told them it was a food allergy on the phone, otherwise we would have just kept the wrong item (which they got wrong).

Disappointed in the customer service, no refund, no food, wasting our time, not good!!!!"}
{"text":"Too much styrofoam. They have no real dishes. Hot soup is in a styrofoam bowl. Egg roll are all doughy"}
{"text":"Very good Chinese food. I love the egg rolls! There is a large variety of food on the menu. The only criticism I have is there were not many combination options. There are lunch plates that are a good deal, but for dinner there are only family meals which are a good value but are very large. They definitely feed 4. Overall an awesome place that I would recommend."}
{"text":"Been ordering delivery from these guys for a while now, and they never disappoint. Always fast delivery, and food always satisfies my cravings."}
{"text":"Visited his place on Sunday 04-15-18, if you're out by the old Henderson side of town you must try this place. Food was really delicious and served in good portions. Really clean location and friendly service. They have a really good lunch special! Will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"I'm a hair stylist in the same Plaza at aqua salon so I have lunch here often.  The prices are very reasonable. I usually get the pad Thai and fried rice lunch special.  It's always been very good.  I'm looking forward to trying something new next time.  The service is always very good also.  Only complaint I have is the crying baby that was there crying though my entire lunch.  Very annoying when people just sit there and let them cry without taking them outside. I would have ordered to go but wanted the soup with lunch special and you only get that if you dine in. I guess I would suggest you either put up a sign no crying children or give the soup to go ha. Anyway, over all I like the place."}
{"text":"When placing our order, I felt like the person who took our order was new because be kept asking us to repeat things repeatedly,  but it embed up right and the food was spectacular!"}
{"text":"Today we ordered the corn egg flower soup and orange chicken.  The order was taken to go. The prices are reasonable with lunch size portions for $6.95.  The orange chicken was soggy and very sweet.  The eggrolls are more like spring rolls but taste good.   Fried rice was very oily.   The staff are friendly.

Update:   After a return trip I decided to increase my # of stars as this is above average.  The portions are huge.  Someone could split a lunch portion.  The general saos is delish."}
{"text":"Was hungry and didn't want to eat the same old thing so I started looking for a new place to try. This was listed as hot and new and a friend of mine and my husband told us this place was good. I stopped at a different place earlier today to try and get some phad Thai but it was closed. This place also offered phad Thai so I gave it a try. It did not disappoint! It was super good, large portion, and great price. Def coming back here again."}
{"text":"China wan wan is a great place to eat if you're craving some awesome Chinese that will actually \"fill\" you up instead of being hungry 20 minutes after you eat  Mongolian beef is great, the king pao chicken is the best I've ever had! You can tell they use high quality ingredients. The pork fried rice has got ACTUAL pork in there...big chunks not baby shreds. All around a great Chinese restaurant with fresh quality yummy ingredients!"}
{"text":"I recommend this place for a quick lunch and accessibility when you might be on a time crunch. Don't expect to be served with proper plates or cutlery, everything is served on to-boxes and styrofoam. Do expect this place to be more of a stop and go kind of place.
But I didn't mind all of that because it made taking my leftovers with me that much easier with a time limited lunch.
One thing I like is that the food portion is big, or at the very least, \"very\" decent. I highly recommend the lunch specials, which are under 7 bucks. You get a choice of a entree, rice or noodles, and the soup of the day.
They have boba here too, but I didn't try it.
Food wise,  there was a variety of choices from chinese style, and thai cuisine. So if you're craving for some fast asian food, but don't want panda, give this place a try. It might be right up your alley."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with coworkers. Located on Boulder highway and Russell. Restaurant was clean and just spacious enough. Food  was alright. We all ordered off their lunch special menu. I got the shrimp chop suey which came with rice, noodles, and egg drop soup. Taste was the typical Americanized Chinese fast food to go. Price just under $7.00. I think I prefer Panda Express just a bit more. Nothing bad but not a memorable visit either."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and ordered delivery, all times were quick, easy and pleasant.
Family oriented, friendly staff and decent food! Lots to choose from - few items my family and I have tried and liked are : Szechuan Beef, Vegetable Egg Foo Yung, Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings, Crispy Duck and Eggplant Tofu!
Some items need work but glad this place is really close by, if there's ever a need for delivery and/or Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Good food, only complain is that they over do it w garlic. Every bite was at least 5 pieces of sliced garlic. Other than that food is great . Busy so place a call in for pick up ."}
{"text":"We're new to the area and ordered pretty late (close to closing) but was very pleased. Food was fresh, pipping hot and delicious. I ordered the string bean beef and Mongolian beef and loved both. Very small rice portions though. I look forward to trying other dishes."}
{"text":"I'm seriously addicted. Their delivery times are quick and the food is great. I order from them at least once a week."}
{"text":"Made my ankles swell with all the Sodium that they added to our food! It swelled for three days even after I ran for three days straight. We also did not like that they use Paper plates & glasses and plastic forks and spoons for patrons who dine in. We saw the cook throw five spoon-full of white stuff, either Sodium or MSG to the food that he was preparing. Geeze! I will NOT BE COMING BACK OR ELSE MY WHOLE FACE WILL SWELL UP!!!!"}
{"text":"So I tried this place tonight after a long drive from Arizona,it was superbowl Sunday and we were hungry after a long drive.So my family and I agreed on this place veggie teriyaki bowls,wor wonton soup and chow mein ....Everything was great! Chow mein was ok ! But other then that we enjoyed our food !"}
{"text":"My most favourite chinese place!! I come here everyday for lunch without fail. Even on my days off! Lovely family owned business!"}
{"text":"So my family and I have moved back to the Henderson area from the north side of town and have been here since July. We are constantly looking for the good eats in every area of our great valley that we live in and I must say that we have found a little jem in the form of an  amazing asian restaurant known as China Wan Wan. Located off of horizan and the 95, this is by far one of the best Chinese food restaurants I have ever experienced. With great dishes like salt and pepper... well everything and sesame beef, to old favorites like Kung Pao and general tao. They even have a fantastic roast duck for a very nominal price, 13.95. I would say that if you live in either Henderson or Boulder City this is a must visit. They even sent me coupons for free apps. Go China Wan Wan!!!"}
{"text":"Good place! Moved down here from New York and it's been hard finding a Chinese good place like back home to compare. The salt and pepper chicken is something I would love to recommend. !"}
{"text":"2 hours for delivery and all I got from eat 24 is 10 percent back . The restaurant was not apologetic at all . The food was cold and nasty . Time to find a new place to go . And I will never order with eat 24 again either ."}
{"text":"I like the food i order like the combination fried rice and also the seafood delight is good. The only thing i didnt like is the BBQ spare ribs because its hard and not soft to eat. The walnut with shrimp is good but its expensive so i beg you guys to lower the price a little bit."}
{"text":"my favorite place of all time!! Fresh delicious food! I also catered food from here too"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and the staff is very nice. One thing that would make it a 5 star is if you could get a small soup to go. I don't need a huge soup for myself and if I want it to come with a lunch plate (which is on the menu) you have to eat in the restaurant. The garlic chicken is my favorite and my husband loves the seasame chicken. We love grabbing it every few weeks for a night in."}
{"text":"For good service , good food , good portions , and good prices,  China Wan Wan is what you're  looking for.  It is a small amd CLEAN dine-in and take out restaurant . As soon as you walk in , they  are ready to serve you. The staff is very  friendly and stay attentive  should you need anything while  you're  eating. If you have lunch  from 11am-4pm , you can enjoy any of their 17 LUNCH SPECIALS ! The lunch specials  are served with fried rice , chow mein , and soup of the day (usually corn egg flower soup), and of course your choice of entree for $5.95-$6.55 (no drink included) .  The food is really good and it keeps me coming back. I will definitely recommend this place  to friends and family when they are in this area."}
{"text":"Ohh! So a family member bought some of China Wan Wan's combination fried rice...I asked for a spoonful and OMG! My mouth went bananas!! I truly was in love!! It was love at first taste!! It is one of the very best tasting chinese rice I've had in my life...I am eating some as I write this review...It is so good...Like one's body needs fresh air to breathe...Delicious is an understatement...I tried their chow mein but it was not my favorite...The real winner here is the combination rice and it is very affordable at about a lil over $7 and (can feed three to four people) I'm looking forward to trying their duck and other dishes and will update my review...In the meantime I say run don't walk! So delish you've got to try!!*"}
{"text":"This place should be called China 9 Wan Wan. This place was awful. After reading all the reviews I thought I would give them a try. Bad mistake, we ordered the Pad Thai and Egg Foo Young both were absolutely awful. We have eaten many Chinese places and Thai places, this place is just terrible. The chicken didn't taste like chicken, not going to say it was dog but it wouldn't surprise me. When you go in, one of the chefs just stands there as if this is a Bruce Lee flick and he is waiting for his next opponent to fight. Not friendly and the food was disgusting. DO NOT GO THERE... save yourself the trip and go to Bangkok 9 or china one. This is my first review and probably my last, I just had to warn my fellow citizens."}
{"text":"Ok so i tried this place because of yelp and feedback from all of you good people telling your experiences.  I had the orange chicken lunch combo and egg drop soup. Was very good food and will come back when in this area ."}
{"text":"Really good Chinese food, made quickly, and comparable prices to their (essentially fast food) competitors just a block away?? Count me in!! I have officially unboarded the \"Express\" and will be getting my Chinese food from China Wan Wan as long as I'm in this area! Ordering through the Yelp app made it that much more of an easy and reliable option, rather than risking standing in a scary long line...or hot routing to another option entirely because of the \"Express\" line. 

They have all the usual suspects for a standard American Chinese restaurant, but what stood out most to me on their menu is all their entrees are still served family size but come with a side of regular rice included. You can upgrade the side (which is basically another family size portion) for a few bucks to fried rice or chow mein, making it more than enough for one or the perfect amount for two.

The orange chicken sauce was full of flavor with hints of savory spices and also included broccoli, a great addition! Orange chicken is never really my \"go-to\", but it's my man's fave so we tried it and I was so impressed- it will definitely be a go-to now! The chow mein was well seasoned and full of fresh veggies, but the noodle was a little thick for my personal taste in chow mein which is usually made with a thin noodle, it was more similar in thickness/density to an udon noodle."}
{"text":"Amazing food, so damn delicious! Fresh, almost home cooked. Great service, family vibes and comfort food all in one cute little restaurant. Good comes out fast and is perfectly made! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten there food a few times and every time it's been very good. Food is fresh and made very well. We will continue to eat there and I love that they are close to my location"}
{"text":"Well, I dont like to give anyone a bad review unless I have had a bad experience more than once. 
They have delivered the wrong items twice now, had us waiting almost a full 45 min longer then they said it would be delivered, but worse of all was getting luke warm food, and soggy rubbery fried food. 

Gave them a chance, but refused to refund at all. Our last time eating here, as I have better things to do with my hard earned money than waste it with someone who cares nothing about customer service.

 Thanks,"}
{"text":"Been living in Henderson for 3 years now and I'm a huge fan of Chinese food. This is now my go to place, everything I've tried is really good! Plus everyone is very friendly when you go in. :)"}
{"text":"Finally a Chinese restaurant that does NOT disappoint me....I'm from New England and been living in Vegas for 2 1/2 years now and nothing even comes close to our food back east but I can finally say I was very pleased by this place, I'm actually very happy I can finally enjoy some Chinese food!!!! (and its only a minute from home)"}
{"text":"I saw this place was officially open after a not so pleasant experience at Pizza Hut next door.  I decided to give them a try for lunch since I work from home and need something quick. I ordered the lunch special with orange chicken, fried rice and noodles.  I also added egg rolls and everything was superb!  Huge portions as always, and everything tasted great. Service was remarkable and the place was really clean.  I'll definitely be back since I live around the corner."}
{"text":"Great food actually use quality ingredients good pricing ! Order the kung pao chicken and the duck ! Fried rice is good too !"}
{"text":"DO NOT!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY FOOD FROM THIS \"ESTABLISHMENT\"!!!!!!!!! I ordered delivery through Eat 24. I gave the restaurant over an hour to make and deliver the food. They did not show up on time. I called the restaurant and was told that the driver was 2 minutes away. 20 minutes later I contacted support at Eat24 to either 1) delete the tip, 2) figure out where the heck the driver was, 3) cancel the order. Eat24 was assured by the restaurant that the driver was on the way. 10 minutes later I called the restaurant to find out where the hell my food was. They were extremely unapologetic. In the meantime Eat24 had deleted the tip and given me a discount. 

When the food FINALLY arrived I asked the driver if had gotten lost in Narnia or something. He didn't care- hd nothing to say. The food was COLD, CONGEALED, and GREASY. I THREW IT THE EFF OUT and will be eating top ramen tonight. Thanks, China Wan Wan!!!!! You guys seriously suck eggs!!!!

Do yourself a favor and patronize ANY OTHER BUSINESS over this one. You guys freaking SUCK!!

P.S.- the people at Eat24 are awesome and took care of me- got me a full refund on the GARBAGE that was unapologetically delivered to my door."}
{"text":"I will never, ever, go back to this place. I went to pick-up my food and realized that I didn't have my debit card and, to make it worse,my Apple Pay was not working. This is when the woman at the register got extremely rude, inflexible and condescending. Yes, it was my fault I forgot method of payment. However, she would not run my card as I had my partner on the phone. Customer service is a lost art and they lost me as a customer. Spread the word this place doesn't know how to treat people."}
{"text":"Always sketchy trying new chinese restaurants, but so glad I found this place.    Great food,  fast delivery,  and friendly service."}
{"text":"Been to many Chinese style restaurants here in Vegas since 1990. I will never come back here again. Ordered the combination chow mein. The meat is marinated in baking soda? That's the explanation I got when I called and asked them why the meat was so squishy and flavorless. Second time here giving it a chance. This will be my last."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place since they just opened close to my house and delivered ! I ordered online which was easy and arrived in about 30 mins. Delivery man was extremely rude he did not bring any of the condiments I requested (forks knives plates fortune cookies soy sauce sweet and sour sauce) and when asked to come back with it he said OK but never did ! He refused to give me a copy of my receipt also! Tried calling the restaurant to speak to manager but they HUNG UP on me!! Food was bland and tasteless ! Crab rangoons were burnt .. Eggplant was ok but certainly not the best .. Chicken with broccoli was disgusting my kids spit it out ... Hong Kong style noodles absolutely gross .. All in all  super disappointed with this place ! Horrible service and gross food .. Never coming back here unless management changes and new cooks are hired"}
{"text":"Really surprised with the quality and portion size from this place. Ordered lunch specials 2 at a time and it's all been solid so far. I think I might order some tomorrow actually....yea i'm doing that."}
{"text":"I have ordered from them many times and tonight they claim to have attempted delivery and call, neither of which was true. To top it off, they said they will redeliver and then 90 minutes later on a three hour delay claim to refuse to deliver or resolve anything. I've ordered dozens of times will be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"The service was friendly and food was quick. I was the only one in the place the whole time which should tell you something. But after eating my stomach was upset and I had frequent trips to the bathroom if you get my meaning. No doubt what caused it. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The fact that they are the only Chinese place in this neighborhood and they deliver kept me going back trying new things.  I was here opening day and have been back several times, each time hoping to find something better.  It is average at best and I am not a picky Chinese food eater.  I just thought nothing was great.  I keep trying new things but nothing has impressed me.  I am really surprised by all the good reviews.  I'm sure I will try them again and will update if the food gets better."}
{"text":"China wan wan is quick and fast service.  Our family favorite is dinner B with wide variety selection of our favorites.  Also boba desert for kids."}
{"text":"No atmosphere, but very CLEAN!
Food is surprisingly good, but portioning could be a little more generous.
Ordered take-out as a walk in.
Service was prompt and food was hot enough to enjoy when we arrived home.
Stingy on the \"packaged\" hot mustard, duck and sweet and sour sauces.
Cashier \"BOSS\" (male) has fingernails to die for, according to my Wife.
A real find, especially in this neighborhood. Well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Ribs broke in half they were so old. They should be ashamed to serve food like that and I called back and I was offered 15%off my next order. What next order never again will I eat here and I will tell everyone about there or customer service and lack of appreciation for there customers that pay there bills. 1 star is to much"}
{"text":"Ive eaten here a few times for dinner with my family and the food is always fresh and comes to you hot off the wok. The waitress there that works there is very friendly. My favorite dish is the Mongolian beef, and the crab rangoons are my favorite too.Their thai tea boba is great as well. Overall really good chinese food, not greasy at all"}
{"text":"I don't know of any other Chinese food place in Henderson that can compare.. I'm from New York and I'd say this place is pretty comparable to the authentic Chinese restaurants from back home.. I ordered the sesame beef, orange chicken and crab rangoon. Portions were generous but most importantly the quality of the food is what hit the spot.. definitely a fan of this place and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Greasy. Diarrhea. Need I say more. I guess I do. It's just not good food. I've had much better grin the frozen section at Walmart"}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food for the price. My family ordered the family deal. It fed all 4 of us. The wonton soup is delicious. I recommend China Wan wan"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Close to my house AND they deliver! I got the Singapore rice noodles, I was pleasantly surprised with the taste and slow heat as you eat! I am a VERY picky person and I ate everything in my box! I think this will be my new Chinese restaurant! I'm thoroughly impressed! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! My family and I loved it. They even delivered it quickly. Very happy, planning on ordering again soon."}
{"text":"I made my order online and it was super easy to navigate through the menu. I ordered egg rolls, beef and broccoli and shrimp chowmein and Thai tea. They gave me 5 free crab rangoons and white rice. The website said 45-1 hour which is normal for delivery.  I was shocked when the doorbell rang and it was only 30 minutes.  Amazing food at a great price with super fast delivery. It's now my only place for take out Chinese."}
{"text":"I've already order twice from here and I'm very happy with what I ordered. Hot Garlic Chicken is super tasty. I ended up eating it in one sitting. Their service is fast too. I don't have to wait long for my food. They have boba! Not too many options on this but it's still fantastic that they have the basic flavors. Prices are reasonable too. It's a great alternative to the down the street. The cashier is super nice, so this is another reason I'll come back."}
{"text":"It was lack luster, not my favorite. The delivery guy rang our door bell literally 5 times! We ordered Pad Thai (it was disgusting) the Pot Stickers were great, the free egg rolls were good, the vegetable fried rice is not what i was expecting... It was vegetarian not vegetable same with the vegetable chow mien. all in all to sum it up, I don't recommend this place it isnt worth the $40 bucks I spent."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far, thank god there's finally a decent Chinese place in this part of town. Their walnut shrimp & crab wontons were probly the best I've ever had.  Also tried the pot stickers, sesame chicken, sweet & sour pork and beef & broccoli, all were pretty good.  Their service has been great, friendly, quick takeout & really clean inside, they also have pretty big portions considering they're also kinda cheap. It may not be the greatest Chinese food I've ever had in my life, but it's definitely the best I've been able to find around this side of town."}
{"text":"Found this little place hidden on a way I sometimes take to get home. The food was really good actually. Had their walnut shrimp, chow mein, fried rice, spicy garlic shrimp and the boyfriend had spicy season chickens wings which he said were really good. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Food is amazing!! Delivery is fast as hell! Customer service is wonderful. Love this restaurant and highly recommend"}
{"text":"Tall Asian guy was very rude and unprofessional . Food was ok. I'll never come back to this place again."}
{"text":"There are times when we are in the mood to try new restaurants around the neighborhood, and this was one of those times, this was also a bad decision!

We ordered our meal on Yelp and chose to pick it up so it would be hot when we got it home. They are only a couple miles away from us, so this wasn't a big deal. 

When we got home with our food, the egg rolls and cream cheese wontons were barely warm. The sesame chicken and garlic chicken were both swimming in sauce. The only thing that was good was the white and fried rice. My husband ordered soup and took one bite and throw it out. That's saying something.

No second chances Won Won, sorry!"}
{"text":"Great price, decent food and they deliver the lunch menu! Whaaaaat?!?! We were starved after traveling and hadn't gotten our rental car, orange chicken and cashew chicken hit the spot. Both were fresh and came with rice and noodles for the lunch price."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Order ALL the food. Seriously, this place is top notch.

China Wan Wan is where I go when my soul needs some healing. The soups are absolutely amazing for when you come down with a cold, I felt better after the first couple of spoonfuls! 

Seriously though: cheap, great quality food with amazing flavor. Their lunch specials come with generous portions of food. I'm a huge fan of the shrimp chop suey, so good. Hot garlic chicken is also really good. I don't really know what else to say besides try out the place, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the lunch special. The food was really good! The restaurant was very clean and the staff was super friendly! The prices are also reasonable. We will definitely be a back!"}
{"text":"We have ordered from this establishment many times and today I just happened to mistakenly order from their lunch menu on eat24 and selected a pickup time of 4:45 PM.  I immediately get a call from the restaurant that I can't order from the lunch menu and pickup at 4:45 PM and when I asked him how can I fix it so I order from the correct menu, the jerk on the phone said the only way was for them to cook the food now and let it sit until 4:45 PM.  Instead of saying we'll charge you extra for the regular menu items when you get here his only answer was we'll cook your food now and let it sit for an hour.  Seriously learn some customer service skills.  So much for loyalty."}
{"text":"I have eaten here often and have found the food quality not consistent. My recent trip my order was very lacking in taste and quality of vegetables. I can't go back anymore not knowing what I will get to eat. All I can say at night I had more problems than afternoons this was food to go. I hope this will help others. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Tried this placed based on a email yelp sent. I had the lunch special of General Tso's chicken. It was very good lots of chicken, you may have leftovers .  Waitress wasn't very friendly but then again it was just take out chinese."}
{"text":"Ordered a few deliveries and they always forget something. Food doesn't taste as good as when I first ate here."}
{"text":"I have placed exactly 30 delivery orders with you. I have spent, as a single person, well over $700 with you in the last several months. That is a good customer. 

Because I voiced a complaint in my yelp review after two very bad deliveries, your delivery driver who I recognize from coming to my front door over and over because his picture is on his yelp profile is sending me nasty comments and remarks. 

I suggest you simply run your business better and keep good customers like me then let petty delivery boys ruin relationships and lose customers because at least four of my friends who also order from you weekly will never order from you again. And I will review you all over the Internet."}
{"text":"This place has great variety on their menu. I've ordered delivery and they are always very professional. My favorites are the beef with brocoli and won ton soup!"}
{"text":"The food was good over all how ever everything was given on styrofoam plates and bowls and it was very hard to eat and pick up the food with plastic forks. If your going with your family to eat I recommend the family dinner A."}
{"text":"I put in a to-go order here about a week ago, but I have dined-in in the past so this review covers both. Service has been quick and friendly. The food tastes amazing, and they have a great variety. It's not close to me at all (and I wish it was) but when I'm in the area I'll be sure to order again. This is my new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Found this wonderful place on my maps! Had decent reviews and we decided to try it. We are so glad we did!!! My husband got the sweet n sour chicken and loved it. I got veggie pad Thai and it was soooooo tasty! My mother in law got the string bean and had way more than she could handle! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"China Wan Wan is a weird name for a Chinese place, but don't let the name fool ya. The food here is actually decent.

The location is still fairly new, and you can see all the way to the back of the kitchen. Every time I have peeked, things always look clean and nice. Service is good, and if you dine in, they do check on you to make sure you are enjoying your meal.

The main thing I can tell you about Wan Wan is their product can be a little spotty. Hit-or-miss, if you will. For example, a few dishes like their Hot and Sour Soup, Pad Thai, Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings and Combination Chow Mein are great. Balanced flavors, fresh and filling. 

But then I will order something else and it won't be what I was expecting. Like, the Mu Shu Pork, Sesame Beef and the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce were all misses. Somewhat inconsistent.

Another inconsistency was the Boba Smoothies. I used to rave about them all the time, because short of driving all the way to Chinatown, these were a gem! They were actually close enough to me to not have to make that annoying trip. But the last time I visited, I ordered my usual fave, a Taro, and it was watered down to hell! I was like, \"What the frick?!\" 

But hey, if you are chillin' on the Eastside, then this is about the best you are gonna find."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp. Quick delivery on a Sunday afternoon. Good was good! Especially enjoyed the Hot Garlic Chicken, Duck and Potstickers."}
{"text":"Was very clean food was tasty service was professional and courteous pricing was reasonable."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place that delivers to my house and decided to try China Wan Wan out. Pro: lunch special on a Saturday!!!  I ordered online via yelp: fish fillet with black bean sauce lunch special, crab Rangoon, and a taro Boba. They have a $15 minimum to deliver and a $2 delivery charge. My total came out to $18.93. A bit pricy, but for the convenience of not having to step out into 113 degree weather, it was worth it. 

After I placed the order a lady called to confirm the order. (that was nice) she notified me that the driver will be here in 50 minutes.. (thought that SAS really long but I really didn't want to go outside and I was starving) so I said ok and waited. Driver came in 30 minutes! Wahoo. Food came hot and Boba cup was super big! Not gourmet, but yummy. (I didn't have huge expectations for a takeout place).. Def better than panda though :) 

5 stars for easy order process, fast delivery, and good food. 

Will order from them again when I'm craving takeout."}
{"text":"After hearing awesome things about this place, gave them two chances and it's safe to say I won't be back. It's a bummer, because it is so close to my house and we lack good food around here, and I wanted SO BADLY to like this place.

The first time, I ordered through the Yelp app and got the General Tso's chicken (I was excited to have a place near me serve that after Panda Express discontinued theirs) with white rice. You have the option to upgrade it to fried rice or noodles for $3 more. $3??? I understand maybe a dollar but $3 is ridiculous. I stuck with the white rice. I picked it up and it was ready as soon as I arrived. I came home and was pleased at first. The flavor was amazing on the chicken, but as I got a few pieces of chicken in, it started to become difficult to eat. I don't know if it was dry or overcooked or what, but there were multiple pieces I couldn't even chew because it felt like plastic so a lot ended up in the trash which was a bummer. 

I decided to try again yesterday and got the teriyaki bowl with half beef and half chicken. As soon as I looked at it, I realized instantly that I should've just gone to Teriyaki Madness up the road. The only edible thing about this dish was the rice and veggies, and the sauce was pretty good. The chicken and beef was hard to look at, let alone eat. There were so many fatty pieces in the chicken, and I had to pull full blown tendons or veins or something out of some of the pieces of chicken. Now I get that it's an animal so those things exist but I like to eat my food without random chewy blobs. And the pieces I was actually able to eat had a really strange taste to them. The beef was seriously undercooked, I feel like it would've been much better if it wasn't limp and soggy. I don't even know what to compare it to, but it definitely felt like I was eating something sketchy that wasn't beef.

If you're not picky about the meat you eat, I say give it a shot because that's the only thing that made this place unbearable for me. I have half the bowl in my fridge still but honestly I probably will just throw it out and not bother to attempt to eat it again."}
{"text":"I would give negative stars if possible. There was a bug in my food and they wanted me to drive it to the store for a partial refund. Terrible service and I am disgusted!"}
{"text":"I was hoping this place would knock it out of the park. There are not many options like this that are as close to mi casa. Wife and I walked in and sat to read the menu. Nobody came over to us or greeted us so after a few minutes I went to the counter. The girl working took our order and was very nice. The food was ready in about 10 mins and we were given free \"egg rolls\". That was a nice gesture and I was grateful but they were not good at all. They have plenty of options so I will be back for some other types of dishes.

-Chicken and Broccoli-not bad. I ordered extra chicken and there was plenty of broccoli. I would order again
-Sweet and Sour Chicken- your average dish you would get anywhere. It was a nice portion
-Crab Rangon- these were my favorite. Very creamy and not a lot of onions
-Fried Rice- just mediocre, on the bland side"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Shrimp moo shu is too die for! Order delivery and it was quick and the food was hot when we got it. Chow mein noodles were perfect!"}
{"text":"Finally another good Chinese restaurant in town! The orange chicken, egg drop soup, and chow mien were amazing I recommend coming here. It's great local food."}
{"text":"I have been eating at China Wan Wan since they first opened. The food is okay most of the time, and is usually ready very quickly. My issue is... I recently started ordering online with EAT24 (a great app) however China Wan Wan, did not honor my order twice. The first time, they refused my coupon from EAT24 that China Wan Wan gave me on a previous order. The second time, my coupon was added by EAT24, and charged. However, China Wan Wan, said they didn't do business with that company (EAT24). Yet, they called to confirm my order place online. They also said my order wasn't paid for online, and when I showed them the confirmation email, they  (the cashier) made a big scene in the restaurant and I was so embarrassed. Of course, I refused to pay twice, and even verified with my credit card company to confirm the order was already paid. I don't understand why this happened. I WILL NEVER EAT AT CHINA WAN WAN AGAIN.  They lost a good customer, for poor customer service. 

By the way EAT24 is a great app, and easy to use. They also confirmed my order was paid for and couldn't understand why the China Wan Wan would not honor the coupons, payment, or order. They cancelled my order, and will return my payment in 3 days.  I would recommend the EAT24 app to everyone, but China Wan Wan should train their employees on customer service as well as let them know what companies they do business with."}
{"text":"Just ordered from China wan wan for the first time last night and I was not dissapointed at all. The prices are reasonable and the have a great selection of apps, mains and sides. I got the honey walnut shrimp, which was freaking amazing!! I devoured it quickly...I also got the sesame chicken which was pretty tasty but I was full by the time I got to it. I also ordered the duck, pot stickers and chow mien. Everything tasted really good and the delivery time was pretty fast considering I ordered at 9:30 pm and they were closing at 10 pm. I definitely see myself ordering from here again, the only thing is that I never got the free large order of combo fried rice (with qualifying purchases) but other than that everything was great( ^o^)b"}
{"text":"My fiancee and I ordered  food from wan wan and had mixed reviews. The fried rice was delicious. The noodles (chow mein) had great flavor but were so soft and mushy I could not eat it. The texture was very unappealing. The pepper steak was extremely flavorful. The sauce ,peppers and onions were bursting with flavor. BUT once again the texture of the beef was almost slimy. It was so rubbery I could not eat it. So, I just ate the vegetables. My fiancee ordered the sweet and sour pork. He said it was the best he had eaten in a long while. The egg rolls while different than I had anticipated were crunchy and tasty. The dumplings were nice but if you can believe it , there was just a  too much meat in them,and not  enough vegetables.  The food was delvered timely and hot. All in all it was ok. We will probably order food from wan wan again but next time   I will not get beef. And, I will request fresher noodles."}
{"text":"Newly moved here; I  wanted something good. Other yelp reviews are on point, everything was good. Salt and pepper chicken wings were great without being overly salty, everything was very balanced. Pre ordered and my food was waiting for me (still warm too) when I got there."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out. I came here for dinner and it was grand opening. When we enter the staff was just sitting and one of them got up to assist up.  This place is clean and the staff was friendly. Very patient as we decided on what to order. I'm a huge fan of chow fun (fried thick rice noodles) so I went ahead and order that. My friend order sweet and sour chicken. Our food came out and timely manner. My noodles were very tough are hard to chew.  Which is not good start. They're suppose to be soft. Ugh I never had a bad chow fun. But I will go back and try it again. Might be their first day so well see. Beside that it was good. My friend like the sweet and sour chicken but he didn't like how it was prepared. They serve it with the sauce on the side. He preferred it came already sauced up. The price was great about $10 and under. They had a few dishes that were $10 and above. They also do lunch specials until 4pm. I will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Been here many time!!! Mu shu chicken is the bomb, always do the take out for this. Price is reasonable and Trina remembers my name lol. Chicken broccoli is also my favorite, been ordering many times. They have family dinner great for  holiday when every buddy closed. Their mango slush is tasty, good drink order."}
{"text":"Arrived late morning, business was still light, just before lunch rush. Kitchen was very well staffed, with everyone having a job to do. I saw supervision; however, everyone knew what needed to be done. The persons working the front were the MOST POLITE! I had a take-out order, and it was delicious. I hope to return very soon. 

Sorry Panda, no more!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here a few nights ago, and I'm addicted. By far the best affordable Chinese food I've had, and it was absolutely delicious. Everything came in larger portion sizes than I expected, and the delivery driver was very kind and polite. Definitely would recommend this to any people who can't decide where to order from!"}
{"text":"Very clean, funny staff, and excellent food I will definitely be back. Hard to find Chinese restaurant that isn't greasy or has MSG in the food."}
{"text":"Like coming here for the lunch specials, good service. I enjoyed many of there items. Lunch portions are huge same as dinner. The price is reasonable for such portions for lunch."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times in 2 weeks!  I love the hot and spicy chicken and sesame beef. Try the potstickers and crab Rangoon. Small small, but busy. Try it, you will love it"}
{"text":"Love the food...honey walnut shrimp is delicious! !! I am a repeat customer for a reason...prompt deliveries and delicious food..i recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"Note: I only give out 5 stars to surprisingly EXCEPTIONAL, best-in-class establishments.  

After driving about 5 hours from the LA area to my in-laws' home in Vegas, I placed a pick-up order since my wife & baby were tired from travel.  (I only say this because it might affect the taste/quality of the food since it took me time to get to the restaurant & about 15 mins. to drive back.)

We ordered the General Tso's Chicken, Salt & Pepper Pork Chops & an order of sauteed bok choy (at least, that's what I ordered).  I would have given this place 4 stars since the food was surprisingly good, but I have to subtract a star since I experienced something that annoys me about many Chinese restaurants: you don't get what you ordered.  When I placed the phone order, I had a convo with the order taker that led me to believe I was ordering sauteed bok choi--I received sauteed cabbage (NOT bok choi, more like napa).  Chinese cabbage can refer to both types, but bok choi is only one type of the two.  If you don't have bok choi, say so, and I'll order something else! 

Nonetheless, the food was surprisingly tasty, with a decent amount of spiciness and not too much sauce.  Despite the bok choi issue, I would order food from China Wan Wan again.  The servers are very friendly and courteous, which is a very nice plus."}
{"text":"I order the chicken and shrimp pad Thai, the quality of chicken is no good, food is way to sweet. String bean and chicken is soggy"}
{"text":"great value and fast service. we got lunch specials and the price was good with more than enough food. the noodles here are great and staff was friendly! we got sweet and sour chicken, lemon chicken, pot stickers, and strawberry and mango slushes."}
{"text":"My son and I heard about all the reviews about this new establishment opened on the corner of Arrowhead and Horizon.  Nice, very nice.  Food was delicious,  hot, fast to serve extremely clean and very  customer service oriented. Great prices for the amount of food you  receive. Definitely worth the money.  You won't be disappointed. Now if the OTHER CHINESE FOOD RESTAURANTS in the area would just get their  shit together as well  clean up their establishments they wouldn't end up on Dirty  Dining  (EWWWW)"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a chance. We are now ditching the other Chinese places. Everything we ordered was delicious (egg rolls, fried shrimp, cream cheese rangoon, potstickers, combination fried rice, won ton soup, sweet and sour pork, Mongolian beef, and my all time favorite eggplant tofu). 
I will be going back for the eggplant tofu and ditching Panda Expresses dinky serving of it. You get an entire tub of it for $8. 
Can't beat the prices and the flavors."}
{"text":"Oh man!!! Oh man!!! Their shrimp chow mein IS MEANNNN so good!!! And service is great , I wasn't expecting their chicken wings to be so delicious!! But they are so tasty and have this different seasoning on them , me n my bf absolutely love it! Must try!"}
{"text":"We've lived in the area for 3.5 years now and this is def the best Chinese fast food we've had. The delivery was fast and the food was great! Will def be ordering again."}
{"text":"Went to check this place out because it got great reviews and is new to my area. Small family style place that seems pretty busy. Ordered Paper Wrapped Chicken and Pot stickers for Apps. Pot stickers were delish. Paper wrapped chicken was pretty bland. No competition with Grand China (other local spot) on those. Ordered Kung Pao Combo and my girl got the Eggplant Tofu. Entrees were great. Shrimp was cooked perfectly in my Kung Pao. Unfortunately, they really shorted me on rice for my entree. No matter, I can make my own at home. My biggest peeve of the place is that everything we had came on/in Styrofoam plates and cups. Plasticware as well... Understandable for to-go orders. But dine -in? Really cheapened the place up a lot. Not to mention, not very ECO-FRIENDLY. As busy as they were, you'd think they could afford dishes. If I eat there again, it will be take out........."}
{"text":"Definitely happy I found this place on Yelp.

The restaurant is nice and clean, the service was good, and the menu is big enough to satisfy anyone's Chinese food craving. I should point out that this is an American Chinese restaurant in a strip mall on Boulder Highway in Hendertucky, those craving \"authentic\" should head into Chinatown. 

The food was prepared very well, came out very quick, not oily at all and I was happy that my 1 1/2 year old found somethings to enjoy :)

Ordered:
Cashew Chicken - I always order this extra spicy and they delivered as promised. Really enjoyed the flavor and the chicken/veggie ration was excellent. Could of use some more cashews.

Shrimp Mu Shu - If you like fried egg, then this Mu Shu will be right up your alley. Yes, there was plenty of shrimp, but instead of the rest being veggie filler there was a real good amount of stir fried egg.

Beef w/string beans - served in a black bean sauce which was nice and garlicky. Again, good meat/veggie ratio and this was one of the dished my little boy loved.

Hot & Sour soup: More flavor than some of the other places, the only way it could of been better is if it had a bit more seafood in it.

Egg rolls - A free bonus. They call them egg rolls, but if anything they were closer to spring rolls as they didn't seem to contain any meat. A little oily by nature, but they kept their crunch through the night, this was the other item my little boy really enjoyed.

We are definitely giving this place another shot, their half roast duck looks good and we really want to try their fried tofu dishes."}
{"text":"China wan wan has the best vegetable soup. It's crazy simple, but so tasty. Lasts for dinner and lunch the next day because the portion is so big. I definitely recommend it. Get a Thai tea boba as well and you're eating good!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Chinese food! It is super cheap and delicious. You can eat right in the restaurant! The staff is excellent. I am so happy to have stumbled upon this place. The staff is so nice! I highly recommend the fried shrimp and chow mein... simply delicious and great quality for the price!! I'm definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"I am so impressed with how good their food is. So far ive tried the orange beef, shrimp w/lobster sauce, combination fried rice, hot & spicy chicken, and hong kong style crispy noodles...everything i mentioned was DELICIOUS! And best part of all is they deliver to my house:)"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked In I knew their was BIG TROUBLE IN CHINA WAN WAN, It was VERY warm inside!

But hey I give the owner credit he let me know that the air conditioning was broken and he profusely apologized. 

Just because he did that I gained a lot of respect for him. It's kind of like EVERYONE see's the Pink Elephant in the room and nobody says anything about it!

So I ordered the Kung Pao Shrimp and my wife ordered the Sweet & Sour Chicken lunch special which was because it was still considered lunch time.

I got a Thai tea with boba and it was really tasty, we decided to get the food to go and if you order the lunch special they don't serve it with soup to go because the containers they serve it in are not very sturdy so I opted for an order of egg flower soup which came with a better container. 

The owner said it was more of liability  issue which I could see after he showed me the cup they serve it in.i wanted some and was willing to pay more to take some with me.

The food was still pretty hot since we live relatively close 2.5 miles away, I liked my Kung Pao Shrimp. My wife didn't like that their was too much tempura on the Sweet & Sour Chicken and the rice didn't really have no flavor to it and the noodles were too thick. I have to agree with her on the rice and noodles.

We ordered crab ragoons as well as egg rolls, both of which we enjoyed."}
{"text":"China Wan Wan isn't a bad place to stop in for some quick Chinese take out. I've been here twice now. Both times, coincidentally, have been when I wasn't feeling so well. I happen to like Chinese when I'm sick. 

The first time I stopped in I ordered spicy garlic chicken and a bowl of hot and sour soup. I had a cold and was looking for something to clear my sinuses. This lunch did the trick though my appetite at the time was not up to my regular standards so I didn't start out eating much more than the soup and a few bites of my garlic chicken. I took the rest home and ate it later. As before, the spice did its job in helping me to breathe again. Not that it is actually so hot. Just enough. Overall, good flavor and a fair portion. A lot of chicken and vegetables.

Second visit was last night. Again, not feeling so well, I was craving some Chinese. Chow fun noodles to be exact. If you follow my reviews you know that I love chow fun. Especially when my stomach is iffy. The noodles tend to calm the beasts within. Chow fun is not overly seasoned and fairly easy to digest. This is no exception. Maybe a little more salty than I am accustomed to (soy sauce I assume) bit still not harsh or off putting. The chicken was a little over cooked and the noodles were a bit clumped together but this was a pretty good dinner. Like the garlic chicken before it, the chow fun did the trick and I felt pretty good when I was done eating.

China Wan Wan is not exactly one of my go-to's when I want Chinese food but it is on the way home and pretty well convenient. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good food!

We had the lunch special Mongolian Beef. It was ready very quickly. It was flavorful, with a bit of heat to it. I used to be wimpy when it came to heat, but I've become more tolerant lately. So this had just the right amount of heat for me. 

This place is very clean, and the staff very friendly and polite. I like that you can see right into the kitchen as well. 

This location is close to home, so I am sure that we will be back."}
{"text":"Just when you think they finally bring some good eats in the neighborhood :(  
 Service was good and fast.  We ordered multiple items from their menu and have to say they were all TERRIBLE...Panda Express Quality- if not worse.   Seemed items were prepared hours-weeks ago or even months ago...who the heck knows??? Everything we ordered lacked freshness, noodles seemed flat tasting-soggy , veggies not fresh, combo fried rice was like glue all stuck together with something that appeared to be shrimp.  Overall food lacked flavor, but our biggest complaint was nothing seemed 'fresh.  One would think with Chinese food things would be much more crisp and fresh...Oh well we tried...hope u don't waste your money ...
Come on now China WanWan...your spanking new....step it up !!!"}
{"text":"Family owned and operated. We all need to support small businesses like this. The food is good, the people are friendly and I'm coming here again and again. Granted it helps that I live less than a mile away from it. But I enjoy a yummy Boba too."}
{"text":"Quick friendly and inexpensive service. The place is very clean and the staff treats you like a friend of the family.  It's not gourmet (nor is it meant to be) but is a good value for the money."}
{"text":"We have order now three times it always takes the full time to get here but on time:) but the food is worth it always hot and delicious and not to grease taste fresh! We recommend this place and the prices are good:)"}
{"text":"Worst customer service. My wife ordered from here for a pickup delivery because they charge $6(SIX) dollars for delivery in the same zip code. When I got to the restaurant they didn't even have the order in the system and I had to wait an additional 30 minutes. When I asked for some sort freebie for the inconvenience, pointing at a cheap slushee drink, the guy at the front played stupid and said that they're not allowed to give anything out and started getting snappy, as I still kept my cool, \"if you're thirsty you drink water.\"

I've never owned a restaurant but if I messed up somebody's order that they ordered and didn't have it ready when we said we would BECAUSE WE DIDNT EVEN START IT I would probably try and give them something for their patronage. Also we had an order over $40 and when I asked if there was any specials he responds \"nope only for lunch\"

Never coming here again, neither should you."}
{"text":"My family and I ordered the family meal and it was great! For 27 bucks you get so much,you have a lot to choose from,and we had a lot of left overs too. Hands down the best chicken chowmein I've ever had as well. This place is also very small,cute,and cozy. Super family oriented and I love it. I also love and appreciate the take out packaging. Makes it feel like real take out!!!! I love this place."}
{"text":"Wow, cooked fresh to order. So many of these hole in the wall places try to cover up the flavor by adding lots of soy sauce, BUT this place lets the flavor of the ingredients through which makes it so delicious."}
{"text":"We found the food tasty and plentiful. 4 stars for that! However, we were a bit startled to be served on styrofoam with plastic utensils for eating and a serving spoon only in the soup. We had the B Family meal which could have easily have served 3 or a family of 4 if some in your party are okay with dividing up pieces of the appetizers. The Kung pao combination had both jalapeño and the traditional red peppers which made it eye-wateringly spicy hot! Servers were attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"Price is amazing
Food delicious 
People always kind and humble 

I am from Miami and this is the best Chinese people I met so far 

Must go and taste the sure ways of Chinese food

And the staff is friendly the owner cooks so that's a plus 

The kids are grown and support the business even the guy name Leo is very nice 

Transformer guy"}
{"text":"They opened maybe less than 2 weeks ago, and as I write this I am waiting to go pick up my 4th meal I've had from China Wan Wan. My boyfriend and I are hooked. The sesame chicken is crispy and delicious, the chow fun is awesome, potstickers are to die for. Not to mention, customer service has been well above par. So happy I've found a new favorite!"}
{"text":"On a day where I didn't feel like preparing anything in the kitchen we ordered out. We bought a load of food including Singapore noodles, orange chicken, honey walnut shrimp etc. the food itself was outstanding! Very good and a lot for the price which was about $40 including delivery. However the wait to get the food was ridiculous. Very disappointing. I had my fiancé listen out for the door and while he did so I had fallen asleep. Took a 1.5 hour nap and when I woke up I expected the food to be there but it wasn't. I waited an additional 30 min so a little past two hours and still no food. I called the restaurant and they said the delivery guy left about 20 min prior. Ok that's nice but still took 80 min to send out food? She said she would give him a call which she did on another line and he didn't answer. She hopped back on the phone and said that he didn't answer and she didn't know where he was...ok this is our delivery driver? She told me she's sorry and call back in about 15 min of he still hadn't arrived. So about 10 more min go by so this is almost 2.5 HOURS and then while my fiancé was walking my dog the delivery driver finally came. I mean come on. Almost three hours later after I ordered my food. Seriously. I really want to give this place 1 or 2 stars because of that. But because of the quality of food somehow it managed to become a 3 star. Just fix your delivery times in the future and you may keep business."}
{"text":"So hard to find good Chow Fun and this is my new favorite place for it. Not a lot of places in Vegas, let alone Henderson, with good Chinese food. Great food and friendly staff. Definitely recommend for GREAT Chinese food!"}
{"text":"We love the food at China Wan Wan. They are very friendly and did I mention the food is really good. I love the chicken Pad Thai."}
{"text":"First and last visit.

The food we got was cold and looked like it had been under a heat lamp for two days. The portion sizes were much smaller than other Chinese restaurants in the area. No napkins or utensils were provided in our to go order. Will not be coming back. We will stick with China a  go go."}
{"text":"Really awesome. Great food. Great prices. Such a great addition to the area
 No even OK Chinese food before. Now off the charts. Everything we have tried is the best. Large portions and priced so reasonably."}
{"text":"Wow this place is so daaam good first time trying it to day some saucy dam good stuff !!! U gotta try the Mongolian beef wooord ;)"}
{"text":"In Yelp friends I trust. It was in Yelp friend Momo. B's pics, check-in comments, and review that created a mental balloon that said \"You have to China Wan Wan.\"  In the near future I'd pop that mental balloon when I stepped inside China Wan Wan. I'd end up liking it so much that I would return a couple of more times. 

   China Wan Wan is in a small strip mall at the southwest corner of Boulder Highway and Russell Road. It is not a stand alone Chinese restaurant. It is a small Chinese restaurant in back of the Popeyes Chicken. 

   The lunch specials are a fantastic deal. They start out at $5.95 and top off at $6.55. The shrimp based entrees are the highest priced ones. A Coke beverage brings the price up to around $8. The lunch specials include a cup of soup. They are served in a styrofoam  plate with the entree, fried rice, and soft chow me in noodles. Before they serve the food to your table, you can look into the open kitchen to watch them make the food. To the left of the counter and open kitchen is the Coke soda fountain. 

     China Wan Wan is more of the take out environment than a full service casual dining Chinese restaurant like The Lotus or China Bistro for example. Here, there is no visual candy like a Buddha statue, pictures of China,  or place mats of the Chinese New Year. It is a take out atmosphere with sufficient seating. Anyways, the food is the eye candy. 

    On my visits,  I had ordered the peppersteak and shrimp chop suey. The peppersteak was really good. The meat was juicy and tasty. They interspersed it with the right amount of onions and pepper. The shrimp chop suey was also delicious. The shrimp were sufficient in size and portions. The representation of vegetables, mushrooms, sauce, and ingredients complimented the mushrooms. The fried rice was of good quality. The soft chow mein noodles were tasty and far better than what I have tasted at some Chinese restaurants where they are filler food. The choice of the soup that comes with the meal is either egg drop or hot and sour soup. Both are good, however, wonton soup would be great. 

    Friendly people take the orders and bring the food to the table. Everything I have been here, they greeted me right away and were friendly. 

    China Wan Wan is China Win Win. When you dine here before 4 pm, you come up winning with delicious Chinese food and Coke for less than Panda Express. I am sending you the reader a mental balloon that says \"If your in the mood for a good Chinese lunch special when your in the vicinity of Boulder Highway and Russell Road give China Wan Wan a try.\" I think it will be worth popping that mental balloon and experiencing China Wan."}
{"text":"One of my dining goals is try all the Chinese restaurants excluding the touristy ones in Las Vegas. When it seems that I came very close to this goal in Henderson, a Chinese restaurant opens. Recently, the second China Wan Wan opened. It had been a mental bookmark. This past Tuesday and Wednesday after morning hikes near Boulder City, I had the opportunity to pop the mental bookmark two times. I have been familiar with the original China Wan Wan at the southwest corner of Boulder Highway at Russell Road. I had dined there on six occasions and bestowed it with a four star review.

  This China Wan Wan is located in the Hammer's strip mall off Horizon Drive between the signalized intersections of College Road and Boulder Highway. It is on the westbound side prior to the railroad crossing. Here is a heads up from yours truly to the hiking and bicycling community. The railroad is parallel to the Union Pacific Railroad Trail. From my experiences hiking the trail, this midway spot is a suitable spot for a trailhead. The nearby China Wan Wan makes for a rewarding post hiking or cycling lunch.

  As I stated in previous reviews, \"I am a fan of the Chinese restaurant lunch special.\" In my opinion, they are the best deals. The average lunch special with a drink costs less than $10. From 11 am to 4 pm seven days a week, China Wan features a lunch special menu with 18 entrees. The price is between $6.55 and $6.95. Interestingly this is more money than the original location that charges between $5.95 and $6.55. There is a possibility that their prices could of gone up. The to-go orders exclude soup. For the record, it seems that one of the few Chinese restaurants that include soup with their to-go lunch special is the New York Chinese Restaurants.

   On Tuesday, May 22; I ordered the shrimp chop suey lunch special. At $6.95, it included fried rice and soft chow mein noodles with crunchy noodles and a bowl of egg drop or hot and sour soup. I opted for the later which tasted good. For an additional $1.50, I ordered a bottomless fountain beverage. The shrimp chop suey was solid. It included seven shrimp that blended in with the warm vegetables. Regardless of how agreeable it was to my taste buds, in my opinion the China Go Go in the Boulder Highway at Lake Mead Parkway Albertson's shopping center serves the best shrimp chop suey in Henderson. As far as the soft chow mein noodles, I poured on Sriracha sauce to give it some flavor. 

  The next day on Wednesday, May 23; I ordered the pepper steak lunch special. It costed $6.55. In place of the soft chow mein noodles, I ordered all fried rice. With it I ordered egg drop soup. For the additional $1.50, I ordered the bottomless fountain beverage. The pepper steak was appetizing and succulent. This was hours later after I microwaved it. Let me explain. On my second visit, I came to the conclusion after eating the egg drop soup that I'd bring home the pepper steak and fried rice where it would hit the spot at supper. One of the dining tips that my dad taught me when I was a kid was that Chinese food tastes just as good warmed up.

  The two entrees that I ordered were thin on the grease and thick on the portions. In other words quantity equaled quality. The fried rice was also good. For the record, my favorite fried rice at this time in the valley is XO in Mountains Edge.

 From years of dining in Chinese restaurants, I have come to the conclusion that the local ones fall into two categories: 1. Casual and 2. Take out environment. China Wan Wan is take out style. Out of the five Chinese restaurants that I have reviewed in Southeast Henderson, it is the only take out style Chinese restaurant. There are eight tables. They serve the food in Styrofoam bowls with plastic utensils. There is limited interaction with the staff that starts from ordering at the counter. A few minutes later, they bring the soup before the entree. The customer pours the drink and dumps the Styrofoam plates. Because of the limited interaction, I did not feel an obligation to tip. If I did, there is a tip jar at the register.

  China Wan Wan is unquestionably mom and pop. The family children hung around the restaurant. Being children they were slightly noisy. The generally well mannered children were very slightly placing the ambiance in the noisy catagory. 

  With two visits to China Wan Wan under my belt during the lunch special, I have something to say: \"I am a fan of their lunch special!\" If I lived nearby I could see myself as a regular. I could also see myself abiding by the advice that I earlier gave the hiking and biking community to stop by China Wan Wan after hiking on the Union Pacific Railroad Trail."}
{"text":"After driving 15 minutes one way to get take out from the original China Wan Wan location at Russell Road and Boulder Highway I was happy to find out they opened a second location closer to me. Where I live there's not a lot of food choices, and delivery options were pizza, pizza, and more pizza. But while they offer fast delivery, that's about the only positive thing I can say about this location. 

We've ordered several times from China Wan Wan on Horizon now, and while the delivery times were fast...the food...well...I don't know how else to say it besides it sucked. We've had overcooked food, food swimming in grease and excessive sauces, and to be honest all but one of our orders has ended up in the trash. It might be the same name as the original, but the quality of the food is not the same. It's very disappointing. So much so that when my family is hungry and we start rattling off places to order from when I mention China Wan Wan my wife and my son both say NO. 

I hate giving one star reviews, especially to a place that opened in an area where there is a need for more food choices. But unless China Wan Wan improves the quality of their food and especially how it's prepared, we just can't see the point on wasting $45 on food that will likely end up in the Apex landfill."}
{"text":"I have now come back a couple of more time and I have to say the staff is so friendly.  The food is really good.  I have had some food delivered and it came quick and was still really hot.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  Thanks China Wan Wan!"}
{"text":"For only being open for 7 months you guys are great! Manager is nice and the food is great! And I'm picky with food. :D"}
{"text":"Weird version of I ordered general Tso' chicken and it wasn't like the normal dish I'm used to. Sure it had the worst cuts of chicken and some the batter was empty or had a lump of batter just like always. However the one vegetable should be steamed broccoli. This dish had stir fried onions, carrots, pineapple, green peppers and broccoli which all seemed liked misplaced food. The flavor of the veggies permeated the dish. The overcooked soggy veggies made me think of La Choy. In summary, if you are craving this dish and steamed broccoli, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Hands down favorite place to go for Chinese food it is SOOO GOOD, the war won ton soup is the best I have had in vegas , very clean pretty fast an the flavor is great I found my self 3 times a week sometimes... definitely worth going if you like Chinese food.."}
{"text":"1 st visit dine in 
Paper wrapped chicken was just okay.
potstickers very good. Definitely would order those again.
I ordered eggplant tofu, almost a bit too much sauce for me & was a little bit oily, but overall very good. Spicy? Not so much.
I definitely plan on going there again carryout or delivery.
I DID NOT LIKE THAT EVERY SINGLE THING WAS ON STYROFOAM
I will update as I explore the menu and try different items."}
{"text":"My wife and I get together for lunch once a week and decided to try this place yesterday.

We love going to local places and supporting them.

First impressions, very small and quaint. Then it went downhill from there.
They don't greet you with a menu. There is a of pile pamphlet style paper menus on top of one of those garbage cans that you put trays on.

The server came to greet us and asked us if we wanted something to drink. We asked for iced teas. She served them in styrofoam cups. Personally, I think styrofoam brings the restaurant down five notches or more. They tasted terrible and we couldn't figure out why. It was fountain iced tea not brewed. I asked for a soda instead and my wife watched her dump out the ice tea and use the same cup for my soda without rinsing the tea out. My wife said \"let's go\". I said let's give it a chance.

We ordered lunch and mine came with a cup of egg drop soup and fried wonton noodles. As the server brought the soup out in a styrofoam cup, she spilled it right in front of the table. Instead of taking it back, she just dropped it off in front of me with soup dripping off the sides.  And walked away. The wontons they gave weren't in a bowl, they were in a bag made out of wax paper which was unbelievable.

The wife looked at me again. \"Let's go\"
We already ordered or else I might have.

We ordered our lunch at the same time yet mine came out first and it was in a styrofoam to-go box. I looked at the server and she just kind of shrugged her shoulders and walked away.  \"Let's pay and go\", she lamented

Then hers came out after on a styrofoam plate.
She ordered Pad Thai with no peanuts and it had eggs in it which was not described on the menu. She cannot have eggs.
So she sent it back and decided she was done and didn't want to have lunch here.

Since mine already came in a to-go container I just closed the lid, we paid the bill and left.

My career is in the restaurant business and I have never seen service like this in my life. She must be related to the owners because she was absolutely horrible.

From now on, we will stick to China go go on Boulder Highway. It's Food Service is much better.

Sorry to be negative but Dang!"}
{"text":"I went in to order dinner for myself and it was very busy--I ordered chicken and shrimp pad Thai. Staff was very nice which is why the two starts, but my meal was terrible. First off, there were only two pieces of shrimp which they displayed in front as to try and trick you. Secondly the chicken was some weird breaded chicken that tasted like egg, and even worse is there were huge chunks of egg as well that made everything else taste weird, too. And lastly, the sprouts were all black on the end like the didn't clean them or weren't good. I ended up just throwing it away. A waste of money and time."}
{"text":"Well did order food for the first time last night. It was good just not great but we will order again cause it was okay. Not sure why they served ribs in their appetizer section and they were definitely not fresh, a couple of them were actually hard, won't order them again. Only order stuff you know they have to make FRESH  that's my advise"}
{"text":"Some things are really tasty some are really bad. Really is hit or miss. The fried items are soggy by the time you get home, might be better if you ate on premise. 
The lo mein is basically spaghetti with soy sauce."}
{"text":"We came right when they opened. We were seated and drinks brought to us promptly. The man who helped us was very courteous and knowledgeable about the menu and what would be good. The egg soup was really good. It was my first time tying it and I loved it! I ordered the combination fried rice, the bbq pork inside of the was my favorite. My wife ordered the beef brocolli lunch special. She's very picky and she loved it as well. We will come again."}
{"text":"I love the food! Their crispy duck tastes authentic. Their fried rice is really good. Go there for their lunch special. The only drawback is during summer it can get hot inside."}
{"text":"Got the shrimp and vegetable chow mein. Very tasty! Great chinese in henderson! Nice little spot!!"}
{"text":"We visited this establishment as it was on Yelps \" Hot & New\" and it is definitely HOT and NEW! Upon arriving we were greeted by the staff who were super duper friendly. Ordered off the lunch menu, and it was priced great! Great portions, great flavor, great food! 

We will definitely be coming back here to try different menu items, and the delivery service they offer! 

Welcome to the neighborhood China Wan Wan! We are excited to have you !"}
{"text":"Food is always good at good prices. Haven't had a bad experience with the food yet, so far everything we have tried from the menu has been good . Tried a different place today and wish I had just ordered from here again."}
{"text":"Great lunch special! 

I was excited for the opening of this place, and was not let down. All in all it really is just a very standard chinese restaurant, but it is very tasty. I have tried the orange chicken and lemon chicken for the lunch special and both were good. I requested Orange beef on the special , but they would not do it. Which to me is confusing because they have beef plates, and orange chicken on the special. Why not combine them? That so far has been my only disappointment. I also really enjoy the chow-mein.

The staff has been very nice so far. I will say that there is an older gentleman who worked there that has been there both times that I have visited that was very awkward. He just sat across the room from us with his head in his hands looking angry. SOO I dont know whats up with that, but ohwell. 

They are not quite 5 star. Nothing out of the ordinary for a chinese place. It is still a great place to get lunch or dinner though."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Everyone is so nice. Great delivery service and fast. Large portions. Better than panda. I love the lunch specials."}
{"text":"Every time I've eaten here the food is very fresh and very hot and very quick. Everything tastes great deliveries quick pick ups quick. These guys know how to run a restaurant.very possibly the best Chinese food I've ever had!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out. Food was Tasty and quick. Very personable children. Nothing fancy."}
{"text":"Nice to have a Chinese takeout place in the area. The place itself is very clean every time I've been in and the owners are very nice. I've ordered here a handful of times and I've never had anything bad. Lunch specials are a no brainier because for $6 they'll fill a take out box to the brim and stuff it with carb of your choice (noodles or fried rice or half half) and the meat of your choice. You will have plenty of leftover as well. Solid Chinese option close to home so that makes it very convenient. Just stay away from the smoothies. Comes from a machine and it's very icy. Everything else here is pretty solid."}
{"text":"In a restaurant wasteland this place is a godsend. There are restaurants in the area just not many good ones.. 
 Everyone liked the food here. Portions are well worth the money , I'd venture to say large or fairly generous. The staff were pretty friendly. Clean and quick. Not amazing but good and reliable. Cheap eats... Worth a go."}
{"text":"If I could give a 0 star Iwould give them a zero star. Had lunch there today ordered Kung pao chicken and it was super hot. Also ordered the $10 beef noodle soup, literally that is all is in that soup. After eating we ordered a lunch special to go of sweet-and-sour chicken with plain white rice.Fact that accepted that soup is not included in the to go orders.  While we wait I requested for a little bit more of the chips they served in the beginning of our meal. Lady refused to give me any, and said I will have to pay a dollar for them. And so I said but it's included in your lunch special, her response is that we cannot give it to you for free because you don't have any soup to go with it. So what is the use of ordering special lunch paying full price and not getting the full meal. I will never go back to the stinking place."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars for the chicken wing appetizer alone!!!!!!!!!!  Stopped here for a light dinner.  BF ordered the wonton soup, I the vegetable soup and we were going to split the chicken wings but I ended up eating most of them.  They are served on a bed of lettuce with a tomato-onion dressing/topping?   The man who brought them promised us that we would like them and he was right!  They were so light and crispy, not greasy and sooooooo tasty!!  The soup had lots of vegetables, the broth was not greasy and had a wonderful taste.  Service was very quick even though they had a lot of to go orders being processed.  The restaurant itself is very casual, I do not recommend sitting near the door if it is windy or cold.  The staff is very polite, service is quick!  Our water glasses were kept full and the food was hot and so tasty.  We have since ordered delivery which arrived quickly and the food was still piping hot.  We've called for pick up and the food was ready fast and still piping hot by the time we got home.  Their pork egg foo young is so good, the sauce has vegetables in it and the egg foo young is not the least bit greasy while cooked good throughout.  We really like this place and will e"}
{"text":"We came here looking for a nice hot meal on a cold day and were very impressed. My boyfriend and I both had the lunch special (only $6.25!), orange chicken and pork with spicy garlic sauce. They both come with soup and your choice of steamed or fried rice, noodles, or a combo of either. I did a combo of fried rice and noodles with my orange chicken. The food comes out steaming hot right out of the wok. The chef is visible right behind the counter cooking the food at very high heat. 

The orange chicken was flavorful and delicate, unlike some orange chicken that can be a little overbearing. The pork with garlic sauce had a good combination of flavors to compliment the garlic flavor. Portions are large so come hungry and you will leave happy. 

We also had a taste of the chicken wings appetizer which was really good as well. We had a good amount of leftovers to bring home and enjoy later. The service is very warm and inviting also!!"}
{"text":"I only gave 5 stars because it won't let me put 10.  Our server was super cool and the good quality is great!  I've gotten so sick of horrible customer service so this place was a BREATH OF FRESH AIR!!!  Two thumbs up China Wan Wan."}
{"text":"Are you guys serious with these good reviews? We are currently bringing the food back to this place because it was atrocious! We ordered the sweet and sour pork, there was no pork. Ordered chicken fried rice, it was NOT chicken. Not sure what it was?? also ordered lettuce wraps...basically the same as the rice doused in a strange sauce. And the free egg rolls? Don't bother. Save your money and time. Might as well go to Panda Express. At least you know it's a corporation who has standards!

My husband just got back in the car and said they were trying to refuse a refund and accused him of ordering food places and returning it! lol you're right QUN ZHANG, that's EXACTLY what we have time to do"}
{"text":"How did this place EVER get a 4 star rating? Perhaps people don't know any better. We ordered 4 dishes and I had to rinse the meat and vegetables off in order to try to save the meal by making my own fried rice out of what I could salvage.

Kung Pao Chicken:  This is supposed to be a spicy dish. It didn't taste like anything. Everything was diced small and I could barely find any chicken.

Egg flower soup: Two much corn starch. Weird unnatural yellow color. Nothing in it, not even a bit of corn.

Shrimp in Lobster Sauce:  No taste, mushy vegetables. Shrimp were large though.

Beef with Broccoli: Old yellowed broccoli, scant poor cuts of beef, tasteless sauce.

I spent $50 on a disaster."}
{"text":"Finally a great Chinese place in the area! Been here twice...great food and service!

Garlic chicken was very good and the lunch specials are all great deals as well. Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"We tried them and we were quite satisfied with the quality. We had sweet & sour pork, fried rice pork and chow mien (spelling)
Excellent service, fast and efficient.  Will go there again..!"}
{"text":"This is my third or fourth trip to the restaurant. I wanted some pork fried rice and asked that it be prepared with extra soy sauce as I like it dark. When I got to the car with it I found the aroma of fried rice from my childhood. OMG was it delicious...like that I would get in Gardena, Ca. long ago or in NYC. A great find! I will get this often and have referred family and friends there."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday evening and ordered 
1. Combination fried rice, 6.95 
2. Hot garlic chicken, 8.95
3. Beef chow fun, 7.95
4. Honey walnut shrimp, 11.95
5. White rice, included with meal 
6. 2 fried vegetable egg rolls, on the house
for $41

- Fast food. Really. They made all our food in less than 10 minutes. Walnut shrimp took the longest. 
- Too much batter on walnut shrimp. Poor texture as if it were orange chicken.
- Hot garlic chicken had good flavoring. Vegetables need finer chopping. 
- Horrible presentation. Reminded me of eating at Big Wong's but with EVEN MORE styrofoam. haha. Borderline food court status.
- Nice service. 
- Chow fun and fried rice not too oily. Pretty good and nice portion. Comparable to LV Chinatown
- Not like Panda. Better than Pei Wei. Out of League of dim sum Chinese style. In the middle. 
- Similar taste to food in a Chinese restaurant in a California Indian reservation casino
- Best served to-go. Wouldn't want to dine-in again."}
{"text":"Grossed out. Beef and broccoli, beef was boiled and slimy.  Mongolian beef not much better.  Have 2 stars because portions are big and price is right. That's all I can say. This was a take out order. Can't comment on decor or cleanliness."}
{"text":"Not only do I love saying this name, but their food taste amazing!  I grew up on Chinese Food so I won't be satisfied with just any wok fried entree. I did my usual test when eating at a new restaurant. I ordered shrimp fried rice and boy was it yummy! After I felt there was now some sort of trust built I ordered sesame chicken. Not every restaurant can make that delicious sweet sauce that coats EVERY bite, so I was very impressed with the deliciousness of the chicken.
I also ordered Mongolian beef. It was the MOST tender beef I've had in a very long time. Who wants Mongolian Jerky??!! 
This is a fairly new restaurant so I hope they not only stick around long term, but stay consistent in their cooking style. I love how they are in uniform and how the kitchen is exposed to the public. I've peeked at their ingredients being prepared and everything looks fresh in color, and chopped to perfection. Reasonably priced considering you pay a lot more at competitors, receive less, with mediocre taste. China Wan Wan is my new hidden gem."}
{"text":"I've had two experiences with this place, both are deliveries so I cannot speak for the in-person experience. My take-out experience was horrible however. The first time I ordered, I had to repeat my order 5 or 6 times, which fine, I'd rather it be correct than incorrect. From there, it took a hour and a half to deliver it and by that time it was cold. The food was very mediocre at best. Full me once shame on you, full me twice shame on me. Never again Wan Wan, never again."}
{"text":"I don't like to write bad reviews but the food here is pretty bad. We ordered 4 different dishes, 2 was just ok and the rest was not eatable. My honey walnut shrimp was simply awful and when I called to find out what happened to my dish they said if I wanted it replaced it would be just the same as I got before... Awful, it was mushy, just like when you take it home when put it on the fridge for hours before eating. Bottom line, really stay away from this place if you want decent Chinese food!"}
{"text":"I love the food always fast and fresh !! So happy they opened by my house.  My favorite is General Chicken, Shrimp fried rice, potstickers, and the war won ton soup!!! I'm a huge fan !!!"}
{"text":"Chinese cuisine is my favorite food and good food in this cuisine is hard to find. I am from LA and we were just visiting for the weekend. I was craving Chinese food so bad, but I don't know the area. I looked at a few reviews and we chose China Wan Wan. Best choice I made that weekend, let me tell you. It is a quick food joint, not a nice sit down kinda place. Plates and other utensils are disposable, it is an order at the counter kind of spot. The staff was SO GREAT!!! This being our first time in, he was very quick to make sure that we had exactly what wanted, even if we didn't know how to order it. He suggested Mongolian beef, which was fantastic. It was spicy and flavorful, as it should be. We ordered an appetizer combo plate, which was fried deliciousness, chicken chow mien, fried rice and orange chicken. I have nothing to bad to say about any of it. My family ate family style, there were three of us, and we still had plenty of food left over. Pricing was cheap. For the quality of food we got and the amount we got, we got a fantastic deal. I can not wait to return!"}
{"text":"I order all the time from China Wan Wan.  Staff is nice but not too personable, which is fine.  I'm not really there to make friends.  The food is very good and authentic.  Special are always a great deal and the service is just as good.  Ordering directly is best and they do deliver.  I find picking up my food to be faster and easier.  Again, don't need to be flashy, just taste good and they do it right.  Only draw back is coupons are rare, but if you do get them they are so worth it!"}
{"text":"Wow! Such a friendly and ultra clean little Chinese bistro! Very delicious! Tons of flavor. Not greasy or oily at all. The staff was very funny and quick! Love their energy. Plus, their Thai Tea Boba was to die for! Good good and smiles."}
{"text":"I've truly only had one item here. That is their shrimp fried rice! Absolutely spectacular! My MOST favorite fried rice of all time!! Inexpensive and quick and flavorful and soooo fricking good! If I could have it more often I would! :D"}
{"text":"We order from this place often. They have good deals on the lunch specials. Authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been ordering here for years and my husband orders enough where they recognize him when he walks through the door. I was hungry and had not eaten in over 24 hours. I decided to order from a place that had never let me down and I like the food. This time I was let down. Not by the food, but the lack of customer service. My order was $43.00 (told you I was hungry). I ordered the crab rangoon, beef Nd broccoli, fried rice and hot and spicy chicken. When my order arrived, rather quickly, I couldn't wait to dig in. When I opened my order I found that they gave me some chicken dish with vegetables. That was not what I ordered. I immediately called China Wan Wan as the delivery guy had just left. I told them they got my order wrong. I ended up talking to three or four different people telling me I ordered spicy garlic chicken. I repeated no I ordered hot and spicy chicken (cooked completely different). The guy on the phone then says that he will make sure I get the hot and spicy chicken next time. Uh no I ordered what I wanted I don't want this chicken. I then got transferred to another person who tried to make me keep the wrong item. I said no again. He then proceeds to ask if I ate the wrong item and I said no because it's not what I want and they can have it back. He then proceeded to argue with me and say that I ordered the spicy garlic chicken even though I was looking at my receipt that said hot and spicy chicken. I then told the man look I will show your delivery guy the receipt. The guy then said well I will have him come deliver your chicken. They finally brought me the right chicken. I won't be ordering from here anytime soon. I may have to start looking for a new spot."}
{"text":"Yep, went there a few times. A fairly small sitting area. Seemed like a nice family environment however. Does take some time to get the food. I like that they add a good portion of fresh tasting veggies to their Chicken Teriyaki Bowl. A long menu with plenty of options. A welcome change of pace from the standard mega corporate fast food."}
{"text":"Amazing food and it was delicious. Made to order and very large portions for the price you can't beat this place anywhere in town and it's made to order so it's always fresh."}
{"text":"Yum! Absolutely hit the spot. This will be our families neighborhood go to for Chinese food! Not only was it good, it was delivered on time, still hot, and pretty reasonably priced. Plus we have leftovers! Will for sure be longtime customers from now on."}
{"text":"This place is better than panda(: 

They cook the food right when you order it too so its hot and ready! 

Also, great service !!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The food is delicious and the service is always with a smile. The portion sizes are generous and most times you will have leftovers. I'm looking forward to my next visit, yum!"}
{"text":"Was craving Chinese and decided to order the closest one near my place for our friends. I placed an order over the phone and the guy was very courteous and friendly. From the order I called in to the door delivered, it was quick within a 30 minute span for a large order. 

Had it delivered and it came to the door, Bay Area style with grocery warehouse box. It was like Christmas. lol

The Honey Walnut was great, placed on top of crispy lettuce. The shrimp size was generous and the sauce was very tangy/sweet which complemented along with the candied walnuts. I think this was my favorite out of all the orders. 
The beef meat for this particular joint, is very tender and soft whether it's beef broccoli or any entrée that has beef in it, which was okay. 
Orange chicken was tasty but nothing to commend on. As far as the kung pao chicken, it was OK; large chopped veggies and small chopped chicken pieces. 
Also the Hong Kong crispy noodle was great, it came separated with the special house sauce (shrimp, beef, chicken, veggies in special sauce) in a container by default. 
The salt and pepper pork chops was great as well, I'd say it was not as 'salty' as other Chinese joints are when it comes to the salt & pepper theme. Crispy and not too salty, gave me a bonus star for that. 

Overall, along with a free large combo fried rice, the food was piping hot & fresh and with the speedy delivery, this joint gets an all 5-Star for me. Would I say this is best chinese joint ever? For some it may, but for this joint, I'd say it's the best in delivery and large, generous portion-sized for its affordable price. Try it, it won't disappoint for the non-fancy Chinese food connoisseur."}
{"text":"We order from this joint often. The portions are huge so it doesn't take much to feed our family of five. The food tastes fresh and the isn't anything around on the east side that can compare. It's the best take out/delivery. They are usually pretty quick with their delivery as well. We love the orange chicken, cashew chicken and spring rolls. You won't regret giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"I used to like to order from this place from time to time but I think those days are over. My fiancé and I ended up contacting horrible food poisoning. The worst I've ever had! I've been sick all night and day."}
{"text":"This review is solely on the food because we got it delivered to us today! It was delivered within 30 minutes, super fast!

This location is new and I always pass by it and we were watching How I Met Your Mother and it was the episode they were all eating Chinese food, and then...it hit me. China Wan Wan. What better place to get Chinese food than to try for the first time.... AND they deliver! I ordered on grub hub because there was a deal and a deal it was! I also spoke to the lady who works there on the phone and she was super friendly and helpful.

They have lunch specials that are actually really good size for the price. My boyfriend got the General Tso's Chicken which came with rice and chow main noodles. I got the honey walnut shrimp which came with white rice. We also got the egg flower soup and our meal came with egg rolls and little fried won ton chips with sauce!

It was a great meal for how much it was worth. Pretty cheap. We've still got some leftovers and definitely still full. I would definitely grab some food from this joint whenever I'm craving authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Decent Food. Good Customer Service.

We ordered the salt and pepper chicken wings and while they were tasty, it was like they added five spice seasoning to it and well, I just didn't expect that on Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings.

Beef Chow Fun is alright. My noodles were a bit too soft for me but it had decent flavor.

I ordered a shrimp dish and it was very plentiful with shrimp. I was actually surprised by how much.

What i love here is the taro boba. For $3 bucks and some change you get a very large drink. That makes my belly very happy. They also mango and strawberry flavor but I have yet to try those.

Overall, China Wan Wan is good to me. I will continue to order from them if chinese carry out strikes my fancy."}
{"text":"Ordered pork in hot garlic sauce and beef in hot garlic sauce to go...found the two to be quite different in flavor.  The beef was sweeter, and the knife cuts were consistent with the type of meat (the pork was in thin strips, therefore the veggies were cut in thin strips, the veggies in the beef were cut to the same size and shape as the beef).  The flavor was very good on both.  Also, I was incredibly excited to see they had boba tea.  I ordered a boba Thai tea and they had the little machine that seals plastic over the drink which is cool.  The Thai tea was great and the boba was the perfect tapioca consistency."}
{"text":"Great Chinese takeout . Huge dinner portions, equal lots of leftovers. Good deal for the price when considering it's really at least 2 meals worth of food per entrée."}
{"text":"Cashier was nice, food was hot, but that's it. I just paid 30 for 2 egg rolls, Crab Rangoon that was small, yet edible at least. The dish called Teriyaki chicken was dried up turkey meat covering mushy vegetables. Not edible, and the Sesame chicken was the same dry turkey deep fried in mushy batter. The sauce was ok but after trying the so called Teriyaki I could not get myself to finish it. Waste of money, completely disgusting!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese place. Good prices, fresh food, great portions!

Don't sleep on the lunch specials. You get soup, chow mein, and your entree. Plus, since it's all styrofoamed up, it's easy to take out as a leftover from the get-go."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here and I'm very happy with everything.  I ordered online for pickup, it was very easy(I didn't like that the site used made it out like I had to download an app, you don't have too, just skip). My food was ready in 10 mins, love! I was impressed with the bbq fried rice.  In the past at different places I found that the rice always had very little meat but it was great here lots of bbq pork.  Everything was delicious and I will be going back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the need beef and pepper steak . Perfect ratio of need to peppers . Fast service and my Meal was uninterrupted."}
{"text":"Since coming to the Henderson area I have searched for someone who has good Chinese Take Out.  Most food when delivered is less exciting than what it had been portrayed as by online stock photos, to greasy and oily or portions are not substantial enough to justify prices.

That was not the case with China Wan Wan.  We ordered shrimp fried rice which was delicious the shrimp was not over cooked and the rice was still fluffy.  Despite being in a small container there was sooooo much food.  We had also ordered the fun fun noodles, not entirely sure what to expect, the large take out box was enough to feed us both two times. 

Our only complaint was the crispy of the egg rolls had faded with the process of delivery and had turned a bit offputtingly mushy.  We were able to revive them with a brief stint in the toaster but without this revamp they would have not been able to be consumed because of the mushy texture.  After roasting the flavors were very good!"}
