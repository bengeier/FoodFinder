{"text":"It was a cute, quiet and comfortable neighbourhood cafe.  The price was for the drinks was cheap.  I would love to come back here and next time I want to bring my laptop in to work there."}
{"text":"I really liked this place but I don't know if I could give it more then 3.5 stars. They have a great view of the park but the seating isn't the best personally. The toilets are so far away, if you were busting to go you might wet your self.
I had a nice peppermint tea. 
The chairs are not that comfortable and my ass starting to go numb after about 10 minutes.
But apart from that it's a great cafe with a chilled out atmosphere."}
{"text":"It was alright. No complaints, just underwhelming. Grabbed a brewed coffee and was meeting a friend. If I was alone I would probably rather just walk up the street  to Ella's."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  It's spacious, bright, the barista is really friendly, plenty of seating, there are a few board games and some book shelves around the cafe.  And yes, my cappuccino was great (strong and smooth) and I had an ancient grain cookie because they didn't have any Awesomes (their homemade soft oreo cookie) left and I figured I should try to be healthy after a breakfast of bacon, bread and sausages. The cookie was surprisingly good (I thought it was going to be dry) but it was moist and just slightly sweet from the small bits of chocolate chips. It was baked fresh in the morning as with a number of other baked treats. 
Will be back and hopefully have one of their Awesomes.

Note: they also have the Toronto Star available on the communal table for you to read."}
{"text":"My new favourite place! People are so friendly there!  I accidentally forgot to mention I was lactose intolerant when I ordered a chai latte, and even after making it, the lady was so nice and gave me one with soy without charging me. I'm so thankful for their kind service! Not to mention it was a great chai latte, yummy samosas and just an overall relaxing place to sit and study. The atmosphere here is very comfortable and cozy."}
{"text":"Great space to get some work done and I love their dirty chai (espresso + chai latte)! They also serve warm winter drinks like caramel apple cider and warm pear and ginger juice. Their communal wood table is my favourite."}
{"text":"Excellent cafe at the vanguard of shaping \"North of the Park\". The Tampered Press is cool without attitude, great coffee, and outstanding treats. Well done!"}
{"text":"I came back to this place on Dec 27th, 2011. It's a really nice place to do work solo. I came here with my boyfriend, and we were working on something together, we almost felt bad to be talking, because we were the only group making a noise..almost awkward, we felt like we were in a library. I am not complaining, i just want to make sure people who come here will respect this, and not be surprised, and maybe it can keep it that way, so there is a coffee place for people who just want to read a book. 

I didn't see any boardgame around, either they took them away or just ever existed...anyways. Store hours is kind of short.. like other espresso bar...they close at 7pm almost every night. (although we were sitting there till 7:20pm last night, and the guy didn't really kick us out, maybe he's not in a rush either)

I had a regular brewed coffee this time, it was great! The cappuccino with single shot is a little bit light...and again not hot enough.

P.S. They don't accept credit card, only take debit or cash."}
{"text":"Normally great for working in - the name says \"cafe and community space\", which is great except the awful screaming in your face ego trip music the guy has on right now is driving me away - can't hear myself think. No work done today then"}
{"text":"I came by for some early morning writing and a strong coffee. Strong coffee is indeed what I got. I ordered the Americano, and regrettably asked for two shots of espresso. I am usually fine with doubles but, I warn you, these drinks are strong! I didn't reallly enjoy it, I asked him to water it down once - but I really just nursed it. 

The atmosphere was nice. The pictures do the place justice - one communal table, a seat of bar stools and a couple square tables squattered around. If you have a laptop, you need a square table - that's where the plugs are. 

The barrista was very friendly, they serve cold water and they have free wifi. They were also playing some nice easy rock music at a low level. It's quite relaxing and quiet. 

My major problem with the place was that it was SO COLD. I don't know if they turned the heat down because it's been mild lately, but on a snowy morning, this coffee shop was far from warm and cozy. Also, when you head to the washroom and into the creepy long halllway, it's even colder. Bundle up!"}
{"text":"went this place quite many times for studying.
nice and cozy place for relaxing or studying, and barely see people who chatting loudly.
Their \"sweet corn cookie\" is super yummy!!!! I highly recommend for everyone to have one. For espresso drink, i would say it is okay, but they have many kinds of drink menu: lots of tea selections, fresh vegetarian juice and so on..."}
{"text":"fucking fantastic view of the park for people/dog watching. steady wifi for working. chill friendly service. wide selection of loose-leaf teas, coffees, and desserts. can't wait to come back and try their new (vegan) samosas. a new favorite spot for certain."}
{"text":"Gorgeous place with friendly staff. Perfect to go during autumn. Grab a friend and go for a drink. Overlooks the trinity Bellwood's park. The chicken sandwich is out of this world."}
{"text":"My favourite place in the neighbourhood. The service is great, and the atmosphere is incredible: accommodating, friendly, and relaxed. The communal tables make it feel like a real community space and the drinks and baked goods are reasonably priced. If you're in the park and get thirsty, there's a water station by the door that anyone is free to use. I am quickly becoming a regular here. I highly recommend the chocolate chip cookies."}
{"text":"I came to Tampered Press to study, but unfortunately, it wasn't as quiet as I expected it to be. The door was left open, so the busy street of Dundas was quiet a distraction. When the customer comes in, half the time, they are socializing pretty loud with the barista. This cafe is has a mix of quiet and noisy moments. I do prefer studying here over a few other cafes I been to, but I just wished it was as quiet as how everyone is describing it. 

I had an iced americano and it was pretty strong, which is the way I like it! 

EDIT: I have tried a few more drinks from here - Iced Mocha and Iced Chai Tea Latte and they were very tasty! UP ON MORE STAR! 

I will probably return back to study, but does not make it to my list for my preferred study spot! (no cafe have yet obtained this spot...)"}
{"text":"A refreshingly friendly and upbeat staff. At the top of Trinity Bellwoods you can do some work, stare out the window or grab and go for a walk. 

Americano is my go-to but the treats are the real reason to stay. An assortment of bake-in-house goodies topped off with my personal favourite the gluten-free lemon coconut loaf."}
{"text":"Really friendly, welcoming and awesome coffee. A playground for caffeinated Mac computers. Kids are welcome and they kids that are there aren't your scary tantrum at the mall variety, they're used to coffee shops. Hipster, hippy, yoga pants, Tilly, CCM or Cinelli, it doesn't matter... you're welcome here. A family run vibe. Did I mention awesome coffee?"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Tampered Press. Croissants to die for, and probably the best quiche I've ever had. Very pleased to have this in the neighbourhood. :-)"}
{"text":"This isn't my regular local cafe, but it is close. Whenever I do go here it's always good. it's a little more cafeteria feel than a lot of the other places in the neighbourhood, but the staff is always very friendly and I can't complain at all about the coffee. I rarely order anything different than a single latte at almost any cafe I go to, so unlike Vivek, I can't comment on multiple drinks, but the latte's I've had here were well made. 
If this place as a tiny big closer, I'd go here more."}
{"text":"Sur Dundas Ouest, un autre café parmi des milliers avec l'avantage d'un excellent choix en matière de cafés ou thés et de la place pour s'installer confortablement."}
{"text":"Remember Central Perks?  Tampered Press is nothing like that, as the matter of fact, it's smaller.  However, both share one thing in common, relaxed and cozy atmosphere.

It was a quick visit, so I can't give a full review.  But here are two things that stood out:

+ Hot Chocolate was terrific!  It had the perfect ratio of organic milk and chocolate.  Very creamy and smooth.

+ Complimentary iced cold water and drinking glasses.  Yep, real glasses, which were neatly arranged next to water pitcher.  

Cute little place."}
{"text":"Cozy place. Can get pretty loud at peak hours, but very warm and comfy place. Had the Hazelnut Mocha.... like a nice warm hug. Definitely good place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Great prices, service, and coffee in a cute location across from the park. Very enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"I am lucky enough to live right next door to this establishment. I go in for a coffee every day, and the service is great!

This place is never overly-packed and the line is never long.

There is also a stamp card/loyalty program that I take full advantage of!"}
{"text":"Having lived in the area for some time, Tampered Press has been on my bookmark list for some time but never had a chance to try it out till now.  I've been missing out on a great neighbourhood cafe with a great selection of pastries.

The interior has an old school neighbourhood cafe feel, with a group of regulars hanging out on a Saturday morning.  You pay (cash preferred), and read one of their newspapers which is a nice touch that you don't see around anymore while you wait for your coffee.

I had the caramel scones and a latte and the scones were well made, with a caramel bottom that I haven't seen at other bakeries before.

Will put this cafe on my regular rotation."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to get work done.  I was probably the most annoying, loudest person there - looking for a good seat (close to a plug because my battery was dead), asking about the wifi, bumping the table a few too many times.

The barista was extremely friendly considering how annoying I was.  My latte was delicious, and just the right size.  I was able to get a lot of work done in the silence.

The washroom was far, far away (down the hall, down the stairs... across the river, up a mountain) - so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"I really like to come to this place to work. Nice atmosphere, nice ppl and a bit of a rustic air
Price is also good"}
{"text":"We found this place on accident while we were walking! We woke up hungover and grumpy and tired. The smell of coffee drew us in, and did not disappoint! I got a grilled cheese sandwich (yes, for breakfast) and it was packed with veggies and yummy cheese. I opted for a jasmine green tea, which was delicious, but my boyfriend's mocha latte was so yummy and espresso-y I had to steal a few sips."}
{"text":"\"This doesn't feel like Toronto.\" she excitedly whispered as we walked in the door. And truly it doesn't feel like Toronto, there is a hushed vibe as you walk in the door. No quirky lamps or pretentious decorations. Just a warm comfy place to drink a coffee and take a moment. 

The shelves that line the walls are full of books, journals and water bottles, inviting you to take a look and think a little more about what you put in your body. The idea of earth/body consciousness also fills the barista menu, where there are several freshly squeezed juices and earth friendly brand choices. 

As the last official stop on the coffee crawl this was a welcome addition, and as I was already quaking with caffeine I opted for a San Pellegrino. At $2.50 it wasn't cheap for the tiny bottle, but after buying a flat of them at Costco I realize they are not cheap in general. Several other Yelpers opted for the fresh juices; the likes of grapefruit, pear ginger, raspberry lemon iced tea, and orange I think. We then crowded around a communal table and enjoyed each others company. This was the only place that really fit our big group and they made us feel so welcome. 

Bottom line...sweet and simple this shop is scrumptious, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Asked for a medium and 2 large. Got 3 medium! After mentioning it to the barista her suggestion was to take a few ice cubes out. How about giving me my money back!?!?  What a rip. To think I tipped these people. Never going back I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"A delightful neighbourhood Cafe with a standard selection of espresso drinks and a few sandwiches and baked goods in case you feel peckish. Definitely not a lunch place, come for coffee, maybe do a little light reading, surf the web catch up with a friend. 

The layout is pretty standard for a cafe like this, there is a large communal table in the middle and a few smaller table on the side, a bar that runs along the shopfront window."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere to work/study/camp/chill/surf.

Staff are friendly. Good Wi-Fi; plenty of power outlets. Rustic chairs."}
{"text":"Nice spot, good coffee, cool vibes. 
I wish there were more things for eats, I always expect a bit more from popular spots like The Tampered Press."}
{"text":"I really like it here! It has such a relaxed atmosphere and vibe. It's a very open and has a nice communal table open in the centre of the shop, as well as window seating and counters offering a variety of options to locate yourself.  I really like the music playlist they play here it feels like they are playing my iPod! Very mellow soundtracks of \"oldies but goodies\" and classics.. Gotta love it!!!The pricing and size of their coffee options is HUGE, definitely worth every penny!! I got the double shot Americano, my usual order, and it was fantastic! The woman working that day was very kind and conversational. It seems like a very warm, welcoming environment, with a great view facing the park. I will return here on the regular when I'm out in trinity bellwoods and will make this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot near the AirBnB i was staying in.  Not a coffee guy so I got a beet, apple & ginger juice & reuben.  Both were really good and this is a nice chill neighborhood spot with a low key vibe and good tunes.  Definitely would come back as they also have free wifi..."}
{"text":"A very small coffee shop and gets pretty crowded, a little to clustered for me. The coffee is so-so I would compare it to Starbucks coffee, Their breakfast parfait is pretty good. You have a great view of the park depending on where you sit. Overall workspace is very limited, only a few outlets."}
{"text":"Came here today with my bestie thanks to the yelp reviews. I'm a bit of a coffee snob and I absolutely enjoyed my cappuccino. Reuben+cheese sandwich and treats (brownie and a cookie) were delish!! Will be back again. The vibe is chill and down to earth - love it."}
{"text":"Great little cafe with very good coffee and tea choices. The highlight however is the Reuben. If you like sandwiches, get this one, it is unbelievable - you'll thank me."}
{"text":"The Tampered Press was one of the more charming locations I visited on the passport. I really like their location by the park, their nice big communal table and collection of board games. It seems like a great place to sit down for a few hours and play some games. One thing that did hit me while I was here was that it's unbelievably quiet in here. Sure almost everyone was doing their own thing but it just seemed a bit more quiet here than it should have been. Made me enjoy my drink more. 

My latte was very nicely done and the barista who I believe was the owner (or manager) was really friendly and nice. 

There's not much else to say, I do wish they had a bit more room to put in some chairs/couches/tables or any sort of furniture, but from what they have, it all seems to mesh well. Not the easiest place to spot from outside but definitely the best coffee stop in the area!"}
{"text":"Great coffee. Not so great pastries. I like the ambience and homey feel of this place. There are a couple of long communal tables as well and it's nicely air conditioned for this sweltering summer. Good reliable wifi so far. My only gripe about the pastries is a small one. I was disappointed that I gave a non appetizing looking lemon slice a chance and wasn't deceived by its appearance. Fortunately the coffee was an entirely different story."}
{"text":"The Tempered Press has that homey feel as I arrived on a drizzly evening but it made the mood that much better as I was pretty much alone this late Saturday.  

The Window Frames, Bookshelf, Potted Plants made it feel like I could comfortably read a novel next to a house window while listening to the soothing rain drops from outside.  It doesn't have that exact spot though, but enough to feel relaxed here.

Cappuccino had nice Latte Art on it however it felt quite watered down so it didn't give me that Coffee Beverage flavour that complements the caffeine I so needed to continue on that night's quest and fun times.  (-0.5 Star)

There's a huge MIRROR once stepping inside from the entrance or you can think of it for fixing yourself up before you head off to that next event.  It would have been fun to put in a Fun House Mirror instead, it's probably larger than those.

2.5 *Star*"}
{"text":"Great place. Perfect atmosphere and ambiance for studying/working/reading. Loved the communal table.  Super friendly baristas. 

Had the cappuccino - beautiful design, taste was average (for an independent local coffee shop). Inexpensive. 

Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"The Tampered Press is super cute. The huge window is a big plus for me. Lots of natural light to look at your coffee date. Free wi-fi makes it a good place to do work too. The sandwiches are not cheap, but they're delicious. The grilled cheese I had had caramelized onions and a bunch of other awesome fillings. 
The downside? The chai tea was not good. But the coffee is great."}
{"text":"Walked by here and noticed they were selling icecream and it was a hot day so we dropped in.

I dont know why they charge so much for such a scoop of really bad sorbet. If it was home made, then great. But it wasn't and the second I saw the person scooping it from the big buckets of a generic brand I regretted my purchase."}
{"text":"I like the vibe of this place. The people that frequent are wonderful to check out. Lots of prettIness.  Come on! Who doesn`t pay attention to the people around them even if you are working on your laptop or next great novel.

The americano I had was OK. Better than average but certainly one I cannot get addicted. The casual, neighborhood feel that can get addictive.
Makes me want to move to the neighborhood.  

I enjoyed sitting at the communal table.  Some thing about sharing but respecting each others space is kinda cool or kumbaya-like."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. It was wonderful to grab a stool by the window and watch the day pass by outside while I worked. 

I'll definitely be back whenever I'm in this part of town. I loved the coffee and the chocolate chip cookie was good too!"}
{"text":"My first visit here was the last stop of the coffee crawl that happened a few months back. I've returned a few times since, craving the quiet, home-like atmosphere and their fresh pear-ginger juice. 

It doesn't seem like much from the outside, the café is inviting once you enter it. There's a large communal table in the centre with smaller tables hugging along the walls. It's an airy and well-spaced room, and more importantly, it's quiet. With the music playing from the speakers, everyone inside is busy working on their laptops or reading a book. With a direct view of Trinity Bellwood park across the street, it's an ideal place to decompress with a coffee."}
{"text":"Great place to cozy up to a coffee and reuben sandwich. The layout is such that you can sit at a big harvest table and read the paper or play a board game, or you can spread out at a singular table with your laptop and get some work done using the free wifi. 

Really enjoyed the coffee and espresso I've had here. Good deep flavour without being acidic or burnt and am a big fan of their baked goods and sandwiches, a lot of which are gluten free. Highly recommend you check it out, it's more than just a cafe, it's like how I'd like my living room to feel someday. Warm and inviting. 

Update: Was in today and the whole place has been redone! It's got a much more modern and open feel to it now and it was lit, people seem to really love the change because the place was packed."}
{"text":"This is a pretty packed cafe and has good vibes. It felt almost like I was working in a university library where everyone is taking the same class and studying for the same exam and rooting for one another. Just a friendly, community oriented type of place. I dig it. But the wifi stopped working within 10 minutes of my stay so I left pretty quick."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places for coffee and quiet work. The place is cozy and I love the big communal tables. They let you spread out and having nearby people working on their laptops keeps you productive! The coffee is yummy and so is the Reuben sandwich. Staff is super friendly and get to know you. I love the music selection which is mellow, retro, and has interesting covers of iconic songs. Also it's a great location right across trinity bellwoods park!"}
{"text":"A cute little place with a nice big table, sun pouring in the windows (well sometimes), and yummy coffee. 

I also thought their biscotti was good but they need a wider selection of offerings in the baked goods department.

accepts credit cards without a fee if over $10.
free wifi for customers (ask for password)
decent washroom but it is not handicap accessible"}
{"text":"Nice place!

Try the dirty chai (chai latte made with espresso).  Not only is it delicious, the barista will give you that cute leaf design on top.  The cheese croissant isn't bad either. Plus, Dan Brown's Angels and Demons is on a shelf high enough to prevent anyone from reading it.  That itself gives it 4 stars in my  books."}
{"text":"The best chai tea latte I've had out! (There is nothing like homemade) The service is excellent and an amazing dog park is nearby!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, yummy chocolate chip cookie that looked very homemade but very cute.

Unfortunately, the espresso-based beverage was disappointing. Also, the wifi was extremely slow. There were quite a few people with laptops so maybe that's why but it was too slow and completely cut out at one point. It was listed on BlogTO's \"best wifi cafes\" section, but I should know better than to listen to BlogTO...

They're well set-up for laptop users. They have an extension cord for all who sit at or near the communal table. Mac users, bring your extension cord unless you're right at that corner.

The wifi was so slow I left and had to Yelp out another cafe nearby, using my phone of course since their internet was down! I looked around and noticed that other users' connections weren't working either.

The decor is cute, the service is friendly, they have lots of plug availability catered to wifi users but unfortunately the severely slow wifi and the bad coffee will not get me to return."}
{"text":"Managed to get a latte and a slice of the lemon coconut loaf to-go a few minutes before closing. The latte was a bit too bitter, but the lemon coconut loaf was excellent. Thoroughly moist and just a hint of coconut -- it got finished within a few blocks walking. Space is cute (including a communal table)."}
{"text":"What a great local place!  First moment I step in from the cold, I notice how there's lots of light and big tables for people to work.  I spy at least 12 people there just on their lap tops... it's a nice and serene place.  Best thing... a quick smile and 'hi' from the barista from the first step into the bigger room.  That helped set the tone for a great visit.

The menu is pretty easy and I notice quite quickly how affordable it is.  I asked for a medium dirty chai latte with almond milk and it only came up to $4.40 ... I can't even get a small at starbucks!  While the barista is making my drink, she is clearly enjoying her job and making great small talk about the weather and typical Canadian complaint about the snow.  It's been a while since there has been a barista this friendly.

With a drink in hand only few minutes later, I was out the door and enjoying my dirty chai.  Oh ... this is one of the better ones I've had in Toronto.  Mildly sweet but a fair bit of spice throw in.  I couldn't clearly tell but I think they do use a premix but it's one of the better ones I've had.  The espresso shot in there was nicely pulled as you can taste it but it wasn't overly bitter or strong to overbalance the chai.

All in all... great option if you're in the Ossington or Little Portugal.  I still have a few more to try in the area but this is close to the top of the list!"}
{"text":"C O F F E E   P A S S P O R T   S T O P (#16)
Drink: Large Mocha

Atmosphere:    Feels like an inverted house that you'd find on a prairie in the middle of Alberta. Everything about this place is just very warm and welcoming. If you're feeling lazy, this is the place to go. To just chill. To grab a nice coffee. To just be. 

The barista was working by herself and was very kind. One of the more memorable people I'd say. And as for my drink, it was strong. I'm sure there was 2 shots of espresso and I wasn't complaining since it totally balanced the too-soothing-almost-wanna-fall-asleep aura I got from this place. AS well, I tried their Apple Pecan Vegan Bar, which was okay, but the texture seemed too mushy for my taste. It was a nice treat, but it did not compliment well with my mocha, perhaps a sweeter drink.

Verdict:     In the winter time I hope these guys serve soup or chili because it would SO perfect. This place is lovely ( :"}

I would never come back for the chai latte.  It was pretty much a large cup of slightly flavored warm car.  My bf wasn't impressed with the cappuccino either.  Although the atmosphere was great (free wifi), unfortunately, we didn't enjoy the coffee too much either."}
{"text":"nice little place with cute decor, bit hot as a/c wasnt running. espresso wasnt really a knockout at all ( i expected something good, and it wasnt). 

That said, ample power outlets and decent wi-fi made this a fine place to stop, get a coffee and bang out some work (and charge my stupid iphone). 

i'd be back if i was running out of juice but wouldnt make this a destination."}
{"text":"The Tampered Press gave me a feeling I am back in school and studying in a library... 

Though this place is jammed packed on a Sunday afternoon... it was so quiet... with the sunlight filtering from the front window.. overlooking the park... everyone were talking but kind of whispering. This is quite different from other coffee shops I been to.. where there are so much buzzing energy. 

Using my Indie Coffee Passport and order a Cafe Latte with Double Shot. Love the latte art here and the barista is nice and friendly... 

There are some board games that you can play with your friends if you do desire..but everyone here seems so busy studying or on their laptop typing away with the free Wifi. 

I do like that huge huge mirror at the entrance...checking myself out make sure I look proper before I off to another yelp adventure!! :)"}
{"text":"Great place to work and/or study. Great atmosphere and lots of tables! My only complaint is the lack of plugs but overall will go again.

Plus their dirty chai latte was amazing!"}
{"text":"Great chocolate chip biscotti... will return to try more food."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the Crawford street address; the entrance is on Dundas Street. After jimmying with my iPhone, stopping three passers by for directions, an attempt at navigating by the sun, and finally, looking at the building, I figured it out.

The Tampered Press is a cozy space dominated by a large communal table with a quiet bookstore vibe. On my very first visit, I managed to score a table with an outlet. Plugs seem far and few between here, but they do have wifi which kept me occupied for many hours in this enclave. A community group took over the big table later on in the evening, suggesting this spot has a solid connection to the locals. Definitely seems like a neighbourhood coffeshop.

My soy latte was simply put: amazing. My americano, was less so -- a bit too strong for my liking. But the baristas clearly know their stuff. I shall return.

Obligatory Title Pun: This lady is a TAMP.   (wha?)

Menu Readability: Chalky, chalk, chalk, chalk.

Need to mention: The bathrooms are a fifteen minute walk away, and you'll feel like you've snaked your way into a different building. For serious.

What this place teaches me about myself: Without coffee, I can barely find a coffeeshop."}
{"text":"Such a comfortable, cozy, chilled out coffee shop for getting some work done. Every time I go in people are quiet and respectful, but it also never feels like I'm getting the side-eye for having a conversation with the friend or colleague with whom I'm sitting. The place seems to be largely populated by neighbourhood creative professionals, with other pedestrians popping in for a beverage to go. With a big window facing south onto Trinity Bellwoods and a well curated soundtrack to boot, its easy to spend a few hours here without getting too restless. Plus, duh, delicious coffee. Bonus points for having real glasses and mugs for those that choose to stay. Captain Planet approved."}
{"text":"Came here for the coding cafe meetup. It's a really calm atmosphere to get work done. Tried the mint mocha and it was fabulous."}
{"text":"I must have walked past this place a thousand times, and I've definitely heard the name before, but without my Indie Coffee Passport, I never would have wound up here. The cafe is tucked into a non-descript corner section of a building, and the entrance is definitely on Dundas.

Given its location, Tampered Press has some really serious competition due east, so kudos to being the only coffee shop in the area on the Passport.

That said, my friend and I were not really impressed with the place. The decor made me feel like I was in a chain (granted, a cool one, trying to look cool and not like a chain) and it was predominantly occupied by a large group of families, and not really the type you'd find at the Communal Mule or Ezra's Pound. Since there were about ten of them, they definitely set the vibe for the afternoon, but this place definitely seems less exclusive and more accepting of coffee drinkers of all sorts. This is neither good or bad, it's just my observation.

Our coffees were nothing special to write about (my friend didn't even mention anything about his drink), but I have to make a special mention of the barista. I don't know his name, but he was a delight and was ultimately the deciding factor in going for three stars instead of anything less. He seemed to be manning the place by himself and he did a great job of it."}
