{"text":"Good food but don't stop if you are in a hurry. It took forever we were there for a solid 45 mins before our  food was served. The wait staff were prompt in taking our order and I don't blame the cook I think they may want to invest in a new grill it seemed to cook very slow."}
{"text":"I love this place. It helps that it's 4min from home, but nonetheless, they have a dynamite breakfast. I can only vouch for the breakfast because that's all I've ever gotten. And with as many times that I've been there, the sweet cook Sylvia will make my eggs and hashbrowns whenever I come in.  They have a lunch special everyday and if it's not on the message board by the road, it's definitely listed inside. 
Good sweet tea and it's always in a styrofoam cup so it's ready to go when you are!
They used to have window A/C in the summer and space heaters in the winter. Now with the new owners of the building, central heat and air is in place and it's much more comfortable. 
Classic country playing on the TV compliments the southern hospitality that you get as soon as you walk in. 
Only warning is they don't take cards. But there is an ATM inside. Other than that, I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast and dinner! Straight out of Mayberry , friendly service, great prices , and an awesome burger! Love little country restaurants like this!"}
{"text":"Straightforward, no-frills, countryside grub stop. Good for those times when you just can't put off hunger long enough to complete a drive over to a larger town.

Decent looking property. Quick service. Unremarkable yet filling food. Agreeable prices.

{"text":"As country as they come & clean as a whistle! Sanitation score is 98! Food is great and the staff is sweet as pie. Made me us feel right as home. Had breakfast and came back for lunch it was as so good!"}
{"text":"This is your typical country restaurant in the middle of nowhere.  They are open most days till 3 and they have specials every day.  They have a hearty breakfast for less than 5 dollars and I promise you will leave full.   There veggies at lunch are delicious also.  You can't beat the prices.  The wait time can be a bit long if they need to cook your order on the grill.  The nice lady behind the grill works steadily but I imagine it is hard to keep up.  This place doesn't take debit or credit.  ONLY CASH.    They do have an atm machine though.  This is the perfect place to stop on your travels if you are looking for some reasonable priced down home country cookin."}
{"text":"If you've been to Benton's Crossroads, give yourself a star, because there aren't many people who have. If you've been to Benton's Crossroads Grill, give yourself another star, because that number is even smaller.

The place isn't much to look at, but they serve a decent selection of grub, and the staff is friendly. If you're flying by on 601 at the right time of day, it's certainly a reasonable place to stop for a bite at a good price. Just don't expect to get much fancy, and make sure you bring cash."}
{"text":"A classic country grill where what they lack in flare, they make up in soulful down own Southern cooking. A joy!"}
