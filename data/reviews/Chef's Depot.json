{"text":"Excellent selection of all manner of fresh, frozen, and dry goods.  Beats Costco hands down.  Great place to buy your sushi grade fish.  Helpful staff and lots of parking."}
{"text":"I came on Jan 22 to purchase a Fox Run Brands Multi Blade Scissors. When I purchased the item I asked the teller if the scissors don't work can I return it. He said yes, in re-sellable condition. I tried the scissors and it did not work as promised. I came in on Jan 29 to return the item and get a refund or I would have accepted a store credit. But the manager Mohammed Nawaz was extremely rude. He said that he will not accept it back and that he will not give me anything. He said this is not Walmart. He told me to find the teller who sold me the item. I searched the store and found him. I took him to Mohammad and he agreed that he told me that I can return the item opened in re-sellable conditon. Still Mohammed refused to give my money back. I told him that he will lose me as a customer cause I will cancel my membership. I own a business and buy many times from you guys. He said it does not matter if I cancel. He will not give me a refund. You have a chance to get my business back. Please get back to me and deal with this silly situation that only costs $12 to me but you will lose hundreds."}
{"text":"The worst thing is, the Japanese sashimi place Sakanaya is gone. That was my main reason for going there as they were so so good. There are way too many things that they sell are from China and I don't trust products from that country. They are famous for using toxins and fake ingredients to make food products."}
{"text":"The person working customer service should be well versed in English. It causes a major communication issue and makes people think the business is incompetent.   Also if a customer calls to ask for a price tell me what the price is. Its a simple question."}
{"text":"Price is competitive but not really a steal but the reason why the store is almost always not patronized and getting rave reviews is awful customer service. In fact, it does not exist at all. There is definitely no returns policy even if it is not the customer's fault i.e. missing count, etc. Buyer's beware or caveat emptor is the best advice you ever get."}
{"text":"The previous review was quite helpful, though lunch is not $3 as quoted, but $3.99 and up.  Tried the $2 waffles breakfast and it was quite tiny in portion.  Also ordered a cappuccino, which was decent, and the Udon Noodle Soup for $3.99 was pretty authentic.  Chewy udon noodles with a proper broth.  For that price though, it would've been better if there were some toppings in the soup.  Was told by staff that their sliders are pretty good.  One for $1.50, and there's a deal if you get 3 of them.  Will give that a try next time~!    Rest of the store is still being stocked, so it's still a bit sparse.  Selection of meats and seafood was great.  Just need to work on the other areas.   Free 1-year trial membership still in effect, but forgot to ask when they were ending the promotion.   Not sure if others will like this, but there were a lot of staff around that approached customers to suggest and introduce new food items.    Looking forward to when they're fully stocked."}
{"text":"Free membership, and easy to sign up.  It's like Costco Business, so everything is bulk!!  Pretty like their sashimi.  But I can do better job on slicing the sashimi than their staff.  I bought most of my kitchen stuff here, like cake pan, flour scoop, etc.  I can find some rare grocery here, like active yeast for bread making.  During Christmas, I usually bake my Christmas gift and I can find most of the ingredient in here (of course, in bulk)."}
{"text":"They usually have good seasonal deals, if you can afford the price and space to buy everything in bulk! The place is always well kept, with many staff members around and ready to help. You need an account registered, and you simply give your phone number at checkout to retrieve your account, no cards are required."}
{"text":"Imagine a Costco that dedicate to food and food only...  That's what Chef's Depot is about.   I dropped by during their soft opening (Grand Opening October 7) and as expected a lot of the shelves were empty. There are though some nonperishable good and frozen food available for purchase.  This place is huge and Seafood department looks really promising.   There is also a sit down eat in area, serving $2 breakfast and $3 lunch?! And Sakana-Ya, a Japanese Seafood and Fish Market that used to be in J-Town also relocated inside Chef's Depot. Sashimi anyone?  The downside is most items are by bulk and membership of $25/year for the shopping privileges. But now they are offering a free first year  trial membership.  I will be back again and check out what they have.. maybe some foie gras? Never know I might get inspired and cook more!"}
{"text":"I am not in the food industry and have no idea the wholesale pricing of the supplies and food.  Therefore, I cannot comment from the perspective of someone who is in the trade.  I am reviewing from a retail customer's perspective.    The store is an eye opener to me as to the raw materials a restaurant uses.  I didn't know Italian wedding soup comes in powder format, in bulk no less.  The second a-ha moment to me is that the wholesale prices of the non-meat groceries are not much lower than the retail prices, when retail grocers put them on sale.  I wonder if grocery stores sell things at cost sometimes to attract traffics.    99% of the products are sold in serious bulk size, such as curry powder by pound, frozen turkey thighs in 9 kg box.  Unless your family is very big, I can't see you buying for personal use here.    There are some items sold in retail packages, such as bread, La Rocco cake, etc.  They are not much cheaper than retail, but they look very fresh.  The frozen meat in box is a deal.  If you have a larger freezer in your fridge, I can definitely imagine going through 10 lbs of chicken breast in a few months.  We didn't shop at the cafe, but I noticed that there was a decent eating area in the cafe."}
