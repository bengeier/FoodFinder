{"text":"Well we have been ordering from China food for 20 years and it was great. But now new owners the food is not as good but wanted to give them time to settle in. Ordered last night Saturday waited an hour and 30 mins food arrived missing 2 dishes.The other dishes were so bad beef and tomato was just grey meat and tasted just awful and the lemon shrimp was just  as bad. We called back about the missing dishes and were told they were too busy if we wanted them then come and pick them up. The driver had just left so they would send him back with the money which was fair but he never came back. I am usually very easy going and just let things go but not this time we kept all the food as delivered and took it back to them on the Sunday and got my money refunded. They were very apologetic but  thats it for us we will not be ordering again very sad after so long."}
{"text":"I have been a customer since I was a child and my family lived on Millwood Rd and that is more years than I care to think about. The food has always been excellent and that continues to this day. If you want delicious, hot , fresh food then China Food is a terrific choice."}
{"text":"Cheaper than other Chinese places, but marginally better tasting. Hot and sour soup looked like egg drop with some random veggies mixed in but was actually really tasty. Steamed dumplings were soggy. Pork fried rice was awesome. Chicken with mixed veggies came with a bland sauce. Overall, I would give it another shot though."}
{"text":"Love this place! Cost is pretty good and cheap! Got chicken and corn soup and chow mein. Decent size. Flavourful and delivery for free over $18 bucks."}
{"text":"Another excellent meal. Arrived on time in spite of construction problems in the area. Food was good and hot. Would highly recommend to everybody."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great american chinese food look no further than China Food. Excellent friendly service and fresh yummy food. Best chinese in Leaside hands down"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and have been trying to find a good Chinese delivery place.  As many people can sympathize, there is always some anxiety ordering from a Chinese restaurant for the first time.  it's either going to be very good or very bad.  There is seems to never be a middle ground. We ordered from China Food and we loved it.  Chow mein, Shanghai noodles and Sweet and sour pork were delicious and the food in general tasted very fresh and clean.  We are have officially found our Chinese food spot."}
{"text":"Overall the food is good, not expensive and fast delivery.  But one thing to avoid: the General Tao chicken.  The worst I've ever had.  Is it even chicken?  It looks like rabbit droppings.  Terrible."}
{"text":"No reviews with pictures online- odd? Hope this helps you guys out Curry beef - flavour is good but they barely put sauce on the meat so its dry- not what you expect for curry. Shanghai noodles- just no. They taste like plain noodles zero flavour. It was just sad Beef with mixed veggies - no. Grey meat all around bland Fried rice- average but not the portion you would expect. It is small. 1-2 ppl Probably won't try this place again."}
{"text":"Fast and cheap. My girlfriend introduced me to this place. You make your order, wait a bit, then leave with your food. You get a lot for a little, it is tasty, and if you are too lazy to walk there they also deliver. Huzzah! Fortunately we live 1 minute down the street so it is super convenient for us."}
{"text":"Combos for families are at least 25% cheaper here than anywhere else. It's still very good. They have some spicy dishes that I'd recommend, and they're very willing to make substitutions to their combos."}
{"text":"This place is a real throw-back. The type of Chinese-Canadian Food I was eating as a kid in the 80's. And to be fair, China Food has been around even longer.   We've ordered in a few times. The food is cheaper, and better than Mandarin and C'est Bon, two similar competitors in the neighbourhood. The better dishes were lemon chicken, lo mein, and sliced BBQ pork.  The food is nothing special, and it's not authentic, but sometimes you just want some lemon chicken. The kids love it, and the price is right. Recommended."}
