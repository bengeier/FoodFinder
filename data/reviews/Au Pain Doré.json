{"text":"Beast bread local chain (or boutique if you want to get fancy) ever! Ok, maybe I'm biased.   We usually stay in the neighborhood of the one near Sherbrooke and this always has a spot on our itinerary. They offer pastries, croissant, bread, coffee and sandwiches. I'm sure there's better but you can't beat the proximity and convenience of their hours (except Sunday's- closed!!)  We usually stop in at some point during the day to pick up almond croissants, chocolate almond croissants and a coffee. All relatively reasonably priced and delicious. I'm always wary of sandwiches at bakeries, however, their sandwiches come pressed and are quite tasty.   They offer free wifi and a seating area upstairs. Service is quick if you're just picking up bread or pastries, however, there can be a bit of a wait for sandwiches and lattes."}
{"text":"Amazing almond croissant! Everything is really tasty. Upstairs dining (not stroller friendly)."}
{"text":"We ate here 3 times for breakfast last week instead of paying $30 per person at our hotel. The baked goods are so fresh, rich and delicious. We ordered chocolatine, almond chocolatine, blueberry Danish, pear and apple Danish, filtered coffee, green tea and chocolate milk (for the kids). Upstairs had lots of seating and free Wifi. There's a Starbucks across the street but we decided to take advantage of this local bakery. Much more variety of baked goods. Note: If you order coffee or tea, you can pay for everything downstairs, then bring the receipt to obtain your drink from the barista upstairs."}
{"text":"We went to this bakery twice while we were in Montreal. Their pastry was so good! I tried 6 different kind and all of them were good. I would definitely go back if I have a chance to visit the city again."}
{"text":"I don't know why none of the people in the reviews have mentioned about their Mango Raspberry Cake.   I'm in so love with their Mango Raspberry cake and it's absolutely delicious :) it's so mouthwatering and I can have it at anytime of the day :) I haven't fallen in love with a cake so much, at any point of time.   I would highly recommend the cake. It's a must try.   PS: They also have mini cakes of the flavor, if you don't wanna buy the small sized cake for first try, but I bet the small size cakes, which has more cake, and raspberry flavor are the best. I love it!"}
{"text":"Great service, awesome croissants, and  very interesting cheeses. I dumped like 30 $ there on a 10 minutes visit. Would totally do it again. The flower market across the street gave the place a real Parisian feel."}
{"text":"Neat little sandwich shop and bakery in the McGill/downtown area.  I stopped in and got a turkey baguette sandwich (thin-sliced turkey, greens, and what I think was a thin layer of dijon)...nothing elaborate, but really delicious, mostly due to the freshness of the bread.  I also decided to try the pain au chocolat, which was good but didn't taste quite as fresh as the baguette.  In any case the whole thing came to a very reasonable price (around $10), so it was a satisfactory lunch.  They have a small seating area on the second floor, upstairs from the counter and register.    A good option for small parties looking to grab some quick, inexpensive, French cafe food.  The employees were friendly and the shop is bright and sunny."}
{"text":"I was visiting from NYC and this place was within walking distance from my hotel. It was a cute bakery. I didn't care for their coffee but their plain croissants were so good. Buttery and flakey, I tried the almond croissant too but found it a bit too sweet but still delicious though!"}
{"text":"Found this bakery on Yelp as it was close to our hotel.  Hands down the best croissants I have eaten in my life (including ones I have eaten in France). We tried the almond, almond-chocolate, and chocolate croissants now.  The almond and almond-chocolate both have some kind of crisp coating on top.  The inside is soft, flakey and delish. On the 2nd day here we got fresh batches from the oven...  an amazing afternoon 'pick me up'.  There are also an assortment of cakes and pastries, and sandwiches.  Quaint seating area upstairs.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We were disappointed by this place. The pastries, (which we walked a decent distance just to try, hearing that they were some of the best in Mtl) were dry and hard. Myself and my fianc√© tried the blueberry Danish, a regular croissant, chocolate croissant and an almond chocolate croissant and all were dry except for the Danish, which was the clear winner of the group. The filling was delicious and the pastry wasn't dried out and hard like the others. The coffee was pretty good, not the best, and the tables in the sitting area upstairs were a little messy, but to be fair they looked extremely busy! I probably wouldn't return, we had better pastries in other non-bakeries in Montreal!"}
{"text":"The only bad thing is that there is not enough seating. If it is nice out just walk down to Dorchester square, plenty of benches :)"}
{"text":"good for a quick bite and very convenient. the almond croissant was better than something you would get at ABP in my opinion"}
{"text":"Awesome Croque Monsieur!!! It's the only thing I've eaten but I love it!! Every time I go to Montreal it's my breakfast place. Service is always great and food delicious and quality. My hung had the smoked salmon and cream cheese on a bagel and he couldn't believe how much smoked salmon was on the bagel."}
{"text":"Great place to get pastries and sandwiches. The place is small and quaint. I love their hot chocolate on a cold day with a fruit tart. It's also great if you sit upstairs and people watch."}
{"text":"I've come here for breakfast twice and it's fantastic.  You get a delicious and filling breakfast of baked goods and coffee for very cheap! Go elsewhere and you don't know what you'll get.. I paid much more another day for a greasy omelet and toast.  The cafe au lait is good, though for my taste they use a bit too much milk.  You may want to ask them to put more espresso or less milk.  The baguettes are great, and they have for you to use butter, peanut butter, and jams.  The apple pastry and croissants are very good.  We also got some sandwiches to bring with me to the biodome to eat for lunch, which were very good.  If none of them in the case appeal to you, you can ask them to make a sandwich for you right then and there with whatever you like inside.  Thus, you have a delicious, fresh lunch that is far cheaper than going to an actual restaurant around here.  I tried macarons for the first time here, and they were fine, although considering the fact that one tiny macaron costs about the same as a large croissant, it's not worth it to me personally.  But it was good to try.  Overall, very nice place!"}
{"text":"awesome croissants! i normally would get a dozen to bring it back home  it is also a great lunchtime spot, they have a good selection of sandwiches and it is not a crazy long line, the food is very good. and you can grab a croissant to go after lunch, perfect for afternoon snack"}
{"text":"This is a regular haunt for me & my family. While my favorite is the Brioche Au Sucre it  is far from all I enjoy there. With my sweet tooth I favor the sweet treats. Mom loves the Lemon tart, but like me will also enjoy the almond croissant and other danishes or tarts. I love to go when it is really quiet then I can get a seat upstairs and people watch."}
{"text":"We took a guided tour of Montreal on Saturday afternoon.  The tour guide told us this was a good place at the end of the tour when the bus passed by the place.  After the tour we stopped by to try the food since it was on our way back to our hotel.    It was almost closing time so they were not making any more sandwiches.  There were a lot of people ordering bakery goods so we also waited to order some to take them back to the hotel.  The lady in front of us ordered 2 huge bags of croissants, which included several almond croissants.  We did not know what type of special she received since they were speaking in French.  I ordered 1 croissant and one chocolate croissant.  They were so good and we wanted more so we went back to the bakery.  When we went back the store was almost empty.  We ordered almond croissant and more chocolate croissant.  My daughter liked the almond croissant a lot.  On Monday, we went back again and ordered more croissants.  Each croissant priced from $2.15 to $2.95.  We found out the special was on 6 items so we ordered 6 items.  My daughter also tried an apple cream pommes and it was very good."}
{"text":"hubby + i had been staying at a b&b which served up wonderful rustic bread from here. at first, we didn't think much of frozen bread, but once we tried it, it was clear this was a winner and we had to take it home!!  before our flight, we stopped by rue peel street to this 2 story bakery + cafe. you can order things upstairs, too! by 5pm, most items were sold out, but right at the entrance were their delicious MINI RUSTIC BREADS .. frozen. :) we grabbed 2 bags (comes in package of 10) along with two express sandwiches (aka TO GO).  the parisian and chicken sandwich were good and very filling. it's perfect for on the go. however, the real winner was still the frozen breads.   we got back to the states ... baked them in the oven (3-4 minutes only)!!! and viola, that beauuutiful delicious bread... spread some cheese on it and oh, heaven!"}
{"text":"I was in Montreal this week and we stopped here. The pear tarts were a slice of heaven! Service was great also!"}
{"text":"This place has been my one of my go to spots ever since my first visit to Montreal. This spot is located on the main hub of activity and serves as a great alternate to bring something to your hotel room or a very good snack for your trip.  I really like their baked good especially the croissants and palmiers.  This trip was no exception I grabbed a Turkey sandwich for the trip back (on a croissant of course :) and a apricot and cheese danish for dessert. the dessert are the right amount of sweet and hit the spot for me.  People seated next to me on the trip back were envious and I ate till my heart was content.  If you are leaving from downtown for your trip back this is a great option (other being the atwater location as the highway exit quite close)"}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches here -. Just baked french bread, your choice of cheese and some great meats or spreads. My preference is the Turkey sandwich. In the summer, I will pick up a sandwich and head over to Stanley park and eat it outside. Also lots of great pastries for breakfast.... or snack or even for desert. I always pick up a few things before I drive back home to Toronto. There are multiple locations around Montreal but this is centrally located if you in the downtown core. A great stop for a light  meal or breakfast.  Highly recommended for a quick bite..."}
{"text":"Good breakfast options. Service was quick and friendly. There are two levels at this location and both levels have food options that you can choose from. The hot sandwiches are really nice. The prepared salmon bagel sandwich was cold and somewhat unappetizing but overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I became addicted to their almond croissants instantly.  Our hotel was nearby, so we stopped in several times.  We even took some home on the plane...if it's worth the hassle of taking through the airport, you know it's good."}
{"text":"A delightful little bakery with fresh breads, croissants and more. I love bakeries, so already having bought lunch, I had to check this place out.  The cranberry bread had plenty of cranberries and a good chewy texture.  The olive bread was also good.  If I am back in Montreal, I would love to try some other baked goods here."}
{"text":"Best almond croissant ever! EVER!!! It's an absolute must visit in Montreal if you enjoy croissants and pastries!"}
{"text":"Booyah!!!  This patisserie in the middle of downtown was one of the highlights of my trip to Montreal. Nothing beats authentic homemade french breads and desserts. I loved it so much, I made two trips in two days. I had a chocolate eclair, chocolate muffin and a mini croissant. My mom had fruit tarte, lemon tarte, almond croissant and tarte aux fine pomme. DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They also have breads, quiche, sandwiches, coffee and other amazing pastries.  The service is fast and friendly.   C'est excellente!!"}
{"text":"Very European, very authentic, awesome variety of sweet and savory, delicious food, cute & courteous staff. Delightfully awesome and reasonably priced for the location!   Plenty of seating upstairs where you can people watch the people coming in and out of the Starbucks on peel.  Pro-Tip- as expected, if you can't read French, you might need to ask them to translate nicely"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for quick and light lunch/dinners at work. The sandwiches are all very tasty and come on quality baguettine bread. The bread has a nice crunch on the outside with a slight soft chew when toasted. Ask them to heat it for you and enjoy it upstairs. My favorites are the Cyrano and Il Perfetto (Ham, dried sausage, spinach). I'd skip the coffee here."}
{"text":"Got the box of 6 mini macaroons & a cranberry pastry.  Thought that the cranberry pastry tasted a bit stale, but the macaroons were delicious.  Would def go back to try some other things here."}
{"text":"Awesome croissants! They have cakes and other pastry things. Very nice place for breakfast, or to grab something and go."}
{"text":"Visited this place last year during January. My sister & I ordered to share: almond croissant, chocolate croissant, citron tart, and a cafe au lait. WOW! They both were extremely freshly made and delicious, as good as the ones sold in Paris. We loved them so much, we ended up buying some more to bring back home. We also purchased a loaf of freshly made bread, and my mom said it was really delicious. Their lattes were also very delicious as well.  If I ever come back to Montreal, this will be the first spot I would visit."}
{"text":"Just a step from where we stayed while in town, we were so happy with pastries for breakfast we retuned for lunch. The coissant, and chocolate pastry were superb. I loved the turkey & brie sandwich with cranberry & onions!"}
{"text":"My friend says I have a regular stomach for meals, a stomach for desserts, and finally a stomach for bread. Pain Dor√© was right up my alley for satisfying all my carb needs.   I remember walking by this place all the time during my first year in Montreal. It wasn't until one day when I decided to have a picnic that I finally paid this place a visit. I have tried their olive bread, raisin and nut bread, brioche, but somehow I always revert back to their classic old baguette. I think if I could only eat one thing for the rest of my life, it would probably be a baguette. Personally I haven't tried their pastries but that's because I have more of a \"bread\" tooth and a sweet tooth. Regardless, their pastry selection looks pretty damn awesome.  They have a sister store called Brioche Dor√©e at St. Laurent and Prince Arthur. The selection of bread there is definitely not as diverse as the ones they have at Pain Dor√©. If you're a bread fanatic, this location is probably better suited for your carb needs. Keep in mind if you go during lunch hours, this place could get pretty jam packed with a line that extends out the door.    P.S. I just found out this place actually has two floors with a little caf√© upstairs. Will probably go up there someday, enjoy a coffee, try out some pastries, and do some people watching."}
{"text":"Pretty staple place to go to get fresh bread and treats. Their 'pain d'erable' is only available in the maple syrup season and is definitely worth getting. I typically stock up and hoard it in my freezer so I can eat it all year because it is that good. Their fruit tart keeps me nice and fat while I am on fruit-tart binges. Also their hot cross bun is great. Muffins are good too. Actually, most everything is pretty good here and there are convenient locations all over town. Sure it is not your little unique-y place, but it is good, so do it!"}
{"text":"Good for quick breakfast and coffee. Pastries are classic French style which is fine for me. Two stories. I liked the upper story."}
{"text":"After strolling the nearby McGill campus, my kid and I were hungry for lunch, so we popped in here for a light bite. I ordered a sandwich with goat cheese and veggies: I forget the name, but it was quite good (if not a tad plain), along with an iced coffee. My kid ordered a croissant. We went upstairs to eat, and the gal behind the counter upstairs prepared my coffee drink (which was excellent). The best thing we ordered was the croissant. It was superb. Extremely fresh and light and flaky and buttery (but not in a greasy way). Makes me want to go back and try their other bakery goods.  It was nice to go upstairs and sit along the window and watch the hustle and bustle and the people of the city below."}
{"text":"got two chocolate croissants and 1 mini cake..    If i'm paying 2-3 dollar for a croissants at least enough chocolate for taste."}
{"text":"Another of my go-to places for artisanal bread if and when I'm in the downtown area. Their baguette 36 heures is the real deal and their pain brioche is just buttery,calorie -dense wonderful, but at $6.25 you might want to watch the scarfing down. Their pastries are also just to -die- for fat heaven, but lately I seem to have lost the craving for French pastry, when it should hit me again, hello delicious calories and damn the cost(s)!"}
{"text":"We were staying down town and this was a great place to grab a morning coffee and pastry. We also grabbed some sandwiches to go to take to Mont Royal that were great. You have to go upstairs for any coffee items but the service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This is an adorable little place to grab a quick breakfast. I had the grilled baguette with butter and raspberry jam, and a cappuccino. My Sweetheart had the Sicilian Panini with coffee and we split a pan au chocolat. Everything was delicious and fresh and the service was charming!"}
{"text":"I came for the Chocolate Almond Croissant. Saw the pictures on Yelp and I had to stop by when I was in town! To say it was amazing would be an understatement. So delicious, decadent, flaky, and yummy, all of it! I wish I lived in Montreal so I could have it at least once a week."}
{"text":"my fiancee and i came here for some french baked goods.. their almond croissant was a bit heavy for me.. their sandwiches were pretty damn tasty though as the bread is absolutely delicious..   i also recommend checking out their sweet potato soup which was quite good"}
{"text":"Simply the lack of Gluten Free pastry & bread  ( rice, buckwheat, almond flour) is just a huge shame.  And a huge minus.  More lactose free and gluten free options wouldn't be that hard at all.   2016- about 65% are lactose intolerant to some degree, 15% of population has gluten antibodies suspecting sensitivity and inflammation after digestion, 6% are gluten allergic intolerant sensitive because of the symptoms and some of them are completely intolerant due to celiac disease.    City of Paris, New York, Toronto,  have gluten free options in nearly every restaurant, cafe, bakery. Bread, cakes, pastry, chocolate, and always GF macaroons...  Montreal bakeries are sooo behind. Event planners, cafes, restaurants and private people are in the need of Gluten Free baked goods!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafe's in Montreal! So conveniently located near Peel station. We were on our honeymoon and each and every day I craved the croissants from their bakery. Always fresh, perfectly flaky. You can't just have one! Their lattes and cappuccinos are also worth your toonies. The dining area is located upstairs, and if you get a seat by the window you can watch the hustle and bustle of the city. We had to make a stop on our way back home just to pick up some mini croissants, chocolatines, and of course baguette."}
{"text":"The prime location and mighty fine pastries keep customers coming back for more. Au Pain Dor√© is a Montreal bakery that has been in business for over 50 years, pretty sure it's not this location though. They have successfully spread across Montreal with a focus on traditional French tastes using artisanal baking techniques and quality ingredients.  This particular location is actually two floors.  The ground floor is the busy section with customers coming and going while the baked goods fly off the shelves. Counters line the walls selling breads, pastries, and other baked goods.  The second floor is jam packed with tables and chairs and a small deli counter.  Normally I don't head downtown for a loaf of bread, but their selection of loaves and baguettes get my mouth watering every time.  Usually I stop by for the pastries.  I just tried their superb cherry danish.  A light flaky pastry covered in a perfect glaze and topped with cherry filling. I'll be back for another one soon.  They build some pretty nice sandwiches too. Built on their fresh baked bread and packed full with full fresh ingredients they absolutely destroy Subway.  Stuff is a little more expensive than Tim Horton's but is pretty similar to what you would pay at Starbucks.  The staff have always been helpful even when we aren't speaking the same language. It's a perfect spot to grab a treat if you happen to be downtown."}
{"text":"Just past St.Catherine on the east side on Peel. Little shop, with displays full of tasty treats. Not for those on a budget,  but a splurge worthy treat for your taste buds."}
{"text":"Nice quick place to eat breakfast; stopped here one morning on vacation with my family because we wanted a quick and easy breakfast. The almond croissant was delicious! So buttery, fluffy, and fresh. They have a wide variety of croissants, mini ones too, and other baked goods, as well as sandwiches, coffee, etc. The view from the seating upstairs is a nice overlook of Rue Peel.  Loved this place so much we came back another morning."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I am so glad I found  this place on Yelp. I tried: almond, almond chocolate, chocolate, raisin du pain, and creme br√ªl√©e. My favorite is almond croissant and creme br√ªl√©e. Both are awesome and you cannot miss it. The chocolate croissant is a little dry. The coffee is ok.   Lovely place with a huge interior."}
{"text":"I come here everytime I'm in Montreal...usually, to get 5-6 sandwiches/pastries for the long-ass drive home.  Its unpretentious, relatively inexpensive, no wait, clean, near many of the main attractions.  Hit it once...you'll be a fan."}
{"text":"By far the most delicious almond croissant I ever had. Crispy on the outside, soft and tasty almond filling in the inside. So good, you won't regret it! Also tried their chocolate almond croissant, it's taste even better, but you need to go early for that, those sell out quickly. Their macaroons are lovely too, not overly sweet but packed with great flavour"}
{"text":"In search of croissants, we came here after seeing the great reviews. Purchased the chocolateine and almond croissants. Delish! Flakey pastry, luscious almond filling and decadent chocolate flavours.   We also tried this dense 'bread pudding' which was unique and nicely flavoured.   We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Boring, unsightly sandwiches but the pastries make me sooooooo hot. I wolfed down an almond croissant only to return a couple of hours later to share a plain one. Someone please teach me how to have more self control!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Exzellenter Cappucino und andere Kaffespezialit√§ten, sehr gute Auswahl an franz√∂sischen Backwaren ! Oberlecker! Wir haben lange gesucht, hier war es perfekt, jederzeit wieder"}
{"text":"Located conveniently near Peel station this place is a must try!! After searching all over Montreal for the perfect croissant we decided to come here and this was the place. The almond croissant was truly amazing. You don't have to be a morning person to try these because despite coming here in the afternoon the croissant was still fresh and hot. The outside was crispy, flaky, and good. When you rip the croissant apart you can still see the stretchy bread slowly ripping apart in all its mighty freshness. The outer crusty flaky part seemed to have a light touch of sweetness to it and complemeneted well with the poofy softness inside. The inner part was also slightly moist as well and very good. Not sure why but the inner part of the croissant was more yellowy as well.  Drinks are ordered upstairs. Upstairs there is a nice sitting area with plenty of light. Paired with a cappuccino it was a truly relaxing and memorable experience"}
{"text":"walked in the store for some easy no frills food and i got was expensive food that was not terrible but i had better.  I had the Dolce-vita sandwich that was mostly mustard flavor, bread was really hard but had great flavor. NOt a lot of meat on the sandwches..  All 5 of my friends said the same thing..expensive food thats barely mediocre..maybe it was the day, slow day for them..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for lunch downtown then no worries because your search is over.  Order anything on the menu and be delighted be the freshness of the food. They always have one vegetarian soup of the day which warms my heart to no end. Their quiches are creamy yet light and their sandwiches are the perfect thing to grab and go when you're short on time.   If you're feeling indulgent and want to treat yourself - you can't go wrong with their lemon tart or their almond croissant.   Hope you enjoy them as much as I do!"}
{"text":"The baguette had a great texture, but the flavor wasn't there.  I wasn't a big fan of the macarons either (but I don't know what good macarons taste like...).  The croissant was good, but I've had better.  Good seating area upstairs though."}
{"text":"Great tiny bakery!  I stopped by to get some french break and cheese and ended up buying so many other things.  All so fresh and the smell does not let you walk away empty handed.  Macaroons and pastries are wonderful.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Not handicap friendly is you want to stay for a latter or hot chocolate as their sitting area is upstairs and they do not have an elevator.   I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is the best patisserie I've been to so far. The almond croissant is something you definitely should get there, it's extremely delicious. The price is also very reasonable. One croissant is around 3.5$ (tax included) and it is pretty filling. On the second floor of the patisserie is a relaxing, clean cafe, where you can enjoy the greatness of the pastries and sweets, along with a nice cup of coffee."}
{"text":"My fav breakfast spot around the world. Got a croissant, a cinnamon roll, a raisin roll and a mini brioche with two large Cafe au lait and an English breakfast tea for a total $25. Had the buns heated up on the second floor at where the lattes are made. Love love love."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy place to buy sandwiches, pastries and cakes downtown Montreal. I really enjoy the fact that there's some decent space upstairs to sit and watch the traffic on Peel. I had a kale salad (delicious - one of the best I had in my life!!!) and a croissant. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of vegetarian choices... but so much good-looking delicacies to try!!!! It's obviously must-return ;)"}
{"text":"We asked our hotel for a good breakfast place and they recommended this gem of a spot which became our \"go to place\" pretty much daily before heading out to explore beautiful Montreal. Everything we had here was delicious, including their cheese and baguette sandwich which they custom made if asked, their chocolate almond croissant and coffee too.   Another delicious item was the pre-made vegetable sandwich, which was a great grab and go item, hard to believe it was so delicious, especially since I normally wouldn't like eggplant.   Cozy upstairs seating and a very clean bathroom; conveniently located near our hotel. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Pastry, pastry, my world for a pastry. I salivate whenever I walk by any bakery - I can never say 'no' to carbs. But take my advice and say 'no' to the chocolatines (chocolate croissants) here - I always hope they taste better than they look, but every time I've eaten one, they're dry/overbaked, with very little chocolate inside. On the other hand, you cannot go wrong with the baguettes, plain croissants, almond croissants, and almond-chocolate croissants. These are DIVINELY flakely, buttery, and melt-in-your-mouth. I've tried some fruit tarts and small chocolate cakes and they've been good too, but nothing has compared to the croissants and baguettes. Drool."}
{"text":"4.8... can always be better but clearly my favourite croissants in Montreal so far!  buttery, tasty, fluffy... almost perfect!!!  PS: I didn't try anything else there (nothing looks really appealing to me... perhaps just a personal feeling because of the display of boulangerie and salads and macarons so close to each other)"}
{"text":"the confidence was the best! I think it's one of their most famous dessert and it's definitely worth the hype. It looks like a giant macaron, but I think it tastes much better. It's crispy and chewy and  has an awesome filling. The chocolate raspberry one is a must try!   There's a little cafe upstairs where you can enjoy their baked goods as well as a cup of hot coffee. :)"}
{"text":"For two decades this bakery, both the St, Cath & St. Laurent locations, is my favorite bakery in Montreal.   The cr√®me br√ªl√©e here is my all-time favorite. Perfectly creamy, sweet and with the most perfect top. Not so hard you have to break it open but enough sugar to add to the taste of the cream custard inside.   The puff pastry cheese sticks are so good. Light, cheesy, crisp and buttery. I could totally get fat on those.  I used to come in and buy a beef liver pate and eat it with crackers. Perfect snack food.   Everything is good here: the croissants, desserts, coffee, sandwiches and I haven't even tried everything they offer yet!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for french boulangeries.  Maybe it's my longing to be back in Paris and biting into a fresh baguette or the fact that the subtleties in flavor bring out your keenest taste buds.  My hubs picked up a vegetarian panini here a few days ago and it was so delicious I had to go back and get one for myself today.    The paninis are grilled perfectly and give you the nice crisp while maintaining the chewy softness of the bread.  I'm typically a lover of meat but the vegetable panini was filled with great veggies like eggplant and tri colored peppers that I didn't miss the meat at all.  What really hit the spot was their almond croissant.  Often you bite into the almond croissant, only to find that they were stingy with the almond filling.  However, Dore's croissant had the nice light crunch of a croissant, the chewiness of the bread, and the delightful almond filling to balance it all out. Though not as good as they make it Paris, this one comes real close!"}
{"text":"They have the best creme brulee. They toast the top right in front of you and they are always friendly. Only bad thing is that they run out so darn quickly. Their lemon tarts are nice as well, more tart than sweet."}
{"text":"I was walking up Rue Peel looking for a place suggested to me by a friend.  Suddenly, a smokin hot chick rossed my path and went into this place.  I thought for a moment, 'maybe smokin hot chick knows a really good place for breakfast. Maybe smokin hot chick and I can strike up a meaningful conversation, fall madly in love with each other, and be together forever?'      Not wanting to tempt fate and avoid ruining the happy delusion my brain had concocted, I entered. I asked the girl behind the counter about breakfast.  She told me I had to go upstairs.  Meanwhile, smokin hot chick quickly got a coffee and quickly walked out. My happy delusion crushed, I slowly walked up the stairs of solitude and inquired about breakfast again to the lady behind that counter.  She explained the specials, and I ordered it.  A croissant with ham and cheese and vegetables, a side of something and a beverage.  (I went with coffee and bowl of fruit.) Total was ten and change. The fruit was obviously canned, the croissant was cold Despite being squashed in a panini press.  The coffee was pretty good. AND I wasn't gonna live happily ever after with hot chick.        It was just an ok meal. I didn't however try their bread, which looked very good. So that might redeem it if you go."}
{"text":"A very good bakery with friendly service. I liked the chocolate croissant which had the right amount of chocolate and flakiness. Also had the chocolate twist that the server recommended, but it was a bit weird. The texture of the filling was a bit too slimey.  I would come back for pastries for breakfast."}
{"text":"We went here on recommendation by our concierge. My children had the chocolate croissants. I ordered the Loraine quiche. My wife had the bagel with lox. Everything was excellent. It is a small pastry bakery with the upstairs ceiling area as well. The cappuccino was great. Good find!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Great selection and lines move fast. The sandwiches are amazing I always get one when I am in Montreal! I love the multi grain croissant with the ham or turkey both are great and it never lets me down!"}
{"text":"Wonderful spot for grab-and-go sandwiches or delicious chocolate bread! The chocolatine is good and only $2. Their almond croissant is very good, not as moist as Mamie Clafoutis, but the crispy cookie top is yummy! Service is great.  They also have cakes and other sweets, they look nice but also like they sat there for a while.  Unfortunately the sandwiches are usually gone on the weekend. Nothing is left!!  For weekday lunch and sometimes dinner, the sandwiches are good. There is seating upstairs for people watching.
