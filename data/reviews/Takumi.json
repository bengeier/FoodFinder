{"text":"Really good sushi. Fresh food and great variety of deserts for an all you can eat place."}
{"text":"This used to be be my favourite restaurant until I booked a reservation for my birthday last Thursday. I have been a regular customer there since they opened and have eaten there once per week since. There is a lot of variety of food and I enjoyed it as it's a byob also. I'm not sure now that I will ever go back. I called to book a reservation for my birthday a couple days in advance. I specified that I would like table 14. I sensed that the woman didn't understand what I meant so I repeated several times I want table 14 at the window for my birthday. That is my spot and really is the best seat in the restaurant. I thought there may be a language problem so I had my partner call the restaurant back and confirm that we have a reservation at table 14. The same person said yes. We then called back the restaurant on the same day as my birthday to confirm the reservation a third time. Get to the restaurant on my birthday and it was not there. The table was occupied. So they sat us in a seat next to a loud speaker. Then we asked to move because it was so loud we had difficulty speaking to one another and it was in a busy uncomfortable spot. They moved us. I was furious because i am a regular and couldn't believe they lied to us 3 times about our reservation being reserved on the phone. There were two waiters that took care of us. They ended up calming the situation and by the end of the night we actually enjoyed ourselves although we normally eat here on weekends. We learned the hard way that the entire staff is different during the week than what we are used to on the weekend. The dining experience and ambiance isn't the same. On my birthday they had incredibly loud music that was Asian karaoke. The music is clearly for the kitchen/administration staff and not for a positive dining experience. This is what it is like during the week. On the weekend the music isn't as loud and it's top hits. It's easier to speak to people and much calmer. Anyhow, so by the end of the night we actually enjoyed ourselves regardless of the mishap and loud/bad music... I get to the cash to pay and the same woman who answered the phone every time we called for our reservation looks at me and says \"im sorry I didn't understand you. I didn't know what you wanted or meant.\" I wasn't sure if it was 14 people.\" Well why the hell did she confirm 3 times on the phone what my request was and if she thought I meant a table for 14 people then where was the table? There was 0 reservation for me. It was when I come through the door to place me anywhere. Then another man behind the counter says see the music isn't so bad. The waiters were so nice and actually turned our dining experience around and then this man and woman whom I bet are the administration totally lied and then made a comment like that to put the cherry on top to destroy my birthday event. After that I doubt I will ever go back. I ate there weekly since they opened about a year or more go and would even bring my friends. They will lose easily 1000$ month from me all because this woman or owner is so careless of customers and what customer service is. If she didn't know what I meant why didn't she ask to clarify. We confirmed on 3 different occasions. Instead of taking ownership and apologizing for her mistake she said she didn't understand me or my partner who called to confirm putting the blame somehow on us. She didn't care about the customers experience. Going to a restaurant isn't just eating good food to me. It's an entire experience.. the ambiance, customer service, dining experience in general. So much!!! They ruined the experience completely for me and my guest. If you decide to go there I suggest a Saturday or Sunday. Way better experience. I'm looking for another byob sushi restaurant now."}
{"text":"Pretty good menu. I have tried quite a few sushi buffets. This is one of the better ones. Would recommand to friends"}
{"text":"Nice setting but really understaffed. Extensive menu (with pictures!) but hit-or-miss quality. Wanted to like this one but can't recommend it."}
{"text":"It's good for the price for lunch time in my opinion. I'm planning to try the supper the only thing is service was slow but I didn't mind waiting for my food."}
{"text":"J'ai découvert ce resto ce dimanche midi 15 mai. Étions cinq dont quatre ado. L'ambiance y était agréable, le service courtois et les sushis à volonté étaient frais et délicieux! Un rabais de 10% a spontanément été appliqué aux enfants et l'addition était plus que raisonnable... Un resto à découvrir, nous y retournerons sûrement!"}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés à midi un Dimanche, nous avons vraiment aimé l'endroit!  Tout d'abord la déco est superbe et le lieu super propre! J'ai même vérifié la cuisine à plusieurs reprises! Ensuite, la nourriture fait changement des classiques Sushi à volonté! Plusieurs innovations dans leur sushi et leur plats ! En plus, Plusieurs plats classiques japonais (yakitori, gyoza,mochi...)  mais aussi fusion asiatique (dim sum, général tao...). Leur sushi sont bons et frais! J'ai bien aimé leur maki avec la sauce à la mangue.   Un gros plus il y'a une carte avec toute les descriptions et des photos de tout les plats ! C'est Très pratique surtout pour les allergies!  Le service était très attentif, et ça ça change vraiment des autres sushi à volonté!   Nous y retournons un soir pour essayer la carte complète!"}
{"text":"Takumi is fancy schmancy for an all you can eat sushi place. The quality is very good, maybe slightly superior to Sushi Crescent, although the two are very comparable. I like the ambience, all the natural light afforded by the solarium like seating area. The service is friendly. This is one of my go to sushi haunts."}
{"text":"I had a craving for massive amounts of sushi and it's on my way during a walk to downtown.  The place was very quiet for lunch, the decor was nice and the service very courteous.  I started with tempura shrimp, potatoes and zuchini which was incredible, a standout.  Followed by nigiri sushi and a sushi pizza. The pizza was ok, the rice in the nigiri was really off and the fish tasted a bit off.  The maki rolls were not much better, so very letdown. There is no sashimi for lunch which was a big letdown for me.  The only saving grace is really the Asian dishes like General Tao, fried Philly cream cheese and others that compensated for weak sushi.  I was too full for dessert but their selection is gigantic (Nutella roll, sesame ball, pineapple and ice cream amongst others)."}
{"text":"The combination of all you can eat sushi and bring your own wine really blows my mind in terms of getting the most bang for your buclk I like high quality sushi, so I was a bit hesitant to try this restaurant. It definitely exceeded my expectations. What I enjoyed the most was being able to draw out the meal, order numerous small courses, enjoy quite a bit of wine, and not feel rushed at any point in the evening.  We were three people and arrived at prime dinner time on a Saturday night without reservations. We were first told it would be a 25 minute wait, which would have been fine, but the hostess was able to rearrange some things to get us seated right away.  It took some time to get our wine glasses and get the wine open, but that is pretty standard at BYOs. After that, service was very quick. We never had to wait long to have our next order sheet picked up.  There were a large number of items that were only available on the dinner menu, and a few that were only available for weekend dinner. Something to consider when planning your visit.  Some of our favourites were the hot and sour soup, fried scallop, spicy salmon maki, the spicy salmon and shrimp tartares, and the sesame ball.  Some of the disappointments were the gyoza, the heavy batter on the shrimp tempura, the very thin piece of tuna on the nigri, and the large and uneven sized pieces of the volcano roll.  The bathrooms are located outside of the restaurant, and you need a key to access them. They were not very well maintained.  As I said, I think this place is a great option for a long drawn out dinner with friends. To this point, there were several large groups."}
{"text":"Excellent service, bouffe fraîche ! Les serveurs sont clairement déborder mais prennent quand même le temps de dire ce qui nous apporte. J'ai enlever une étoile du au stress ressenti sur place par cette fameuse course et une étoile pour les toilettes qui était lugubre!!"}
{"text":"Plein de plats à partager, des raviolis, du buf, du poulet, du riz, de la salade... bref ça n'arrêtait pas d'arriver! Et qu'est ce que c'était bon! C'est certain que nous y retournerons pour manger ce que nous ne mangeons pas à la maison Attention quand ils disent que ça pique... ça pique vraiment!"}
{"text":"Takumi prend la relève de Sushi 999 en tant que restaurant asiatique à volonté. Cependant, contrairement à 999, Takumi offre aussi aux clients d'apporter leur vin, ce qui n'est pas à négliger! Les prix sont raisonnables, les serveurs étaient gentils et le decor n'était pas trop kitsch! Cependant, et il fallait s'y attendre, les sushis n'étaient pas de la meilleure qualité. De plus, il y a certains items que nous n'avons jamais reçus. En général, je recommande cet établissement aux étudiants (qui bénéficient d'un 10% de rabais), et aux gens voulant fêter."}
{"text":"For the type of restaurant it deserves a 4.5*  The place is an All-you-can-eat sushis and Japanese cuisine, and BYOB. These are hard to find in Montreal and this one is a gem.   Everything we ordered was good, from soups (tomyum and miso), to sushis, including fried shrimps, edamame and more.  They have enough cuisine items to please your non-sushis-fans friends.   We were 3 girls on a Thursday night and seated immediately. I have to say the space is not really designed for large groups but I guess they can accommodate.   Service was great, waiter came often to check if everything was to our liking and nothing was missing.   I was too excited with the food to take pictures, which says a lot.   The reviews are accurate. Go and enjoy!  EDIT: we came in at 9:40 on Monday (they close at 10) and not only did they let us sat down, the service and food was great. We went a little overboard with our order and the waiter kindly wrapped the rest to go."}
{"text":"Very good food but small portions. Portions were not a huge deal since we got all you can eat which was $26 each for dinner. Well worth it. We ordered 3 rounds of food. The food was good but service was slow;however, they were busy and it seemed there was only one server for a while. The dessert was amazing I recommend the Pearls of Japan. And the salmon on a bed of rice.   Décor was very pretty and well spaced out. Not many seats and lots of people waiting to be seated. Very cold inside too.   Thé bring your own wine was a nice touch of uniqueness. It went well with the sushi.   Great place to go to. Definitely come again."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!! Nous sommes allés dans ce resto à volonté faute d'avoir pu entrer au thaïlandais réputé à quelques mètres de là qui était complet.  Direct le serveur veut nous placer en vitrine alors que le resto est déjà plein. Nous ne sommes pas des produits promotionnels, nous préférons la banquette. La table est dressée pour 2 personnes, nous attendons 1/2h avant d'avoir le 3ème couvert, les cartes et de l'eau. Nous passons une première commande et 1/2h plus tard il nous apporte le premier plat puis les suivants au compte goutte, tout est mauvais, de la salade d'algues aux sushis, qu'ils osent appeler sushis??!! Des sushis avec du saumon en can du Cosco?? Sérieux?!! Nous n'avons même pas reçu toute notre commande et n'en n'avons rien commandé d'autre.  En salle, que de jeunes, alors, je ne sais pas si les papilles s'aiguisent au file du temps mais je ne remettrai jamais les pied dans ce resto qui est une pure ARNAQUE!  À 3 on s'en tire pour 100$ taxes incluses c'est honteux et une entrave à la cuisine japonaise! Ce restaurant devrait fermer ses portes."}
{"text":"Les sushis sont excellents dans les meilleurs que j'ai goûté et les serveurs très courtois. J'y ai adoré l'ambiance également, contrairement à certaines places, les tables sont espacées et nous ne sommes pas trop serrés avec les gens à côté. Un apportez votre vin qui mérite d'être connu"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying this spot last night and I was glad I gave it a chance. The service was incredible and the waiter was super helpful and took the time to explain the whole concept of the restaurant and items on the menu. It has a wide variety of Asian dishes and great sushi selections, from dumplings to sushi rolls and everything in between.   Aside from the fresh selection of food, this is a BYOB so right there it's a plus in my book. There was a few items that were a little on the salty side bit everything was very good. They have a few deserts I suggest you try like the sweet bread and the pearl of Japan. Delicious.  I can't wait for my next visit to try other fantastic dishes."}
{"text":"Anciennement le 999 sushi, fermé pour travaux et ouvert de nouveau avec un look plus moderne, ce restaurant propose des sushis à volonté à environ 16 ou 17$ le midi et 26 ou 28$ le soir dépendemment si c'est la semaine ou le week end. Nous sommes allés un jeudi soir vers 18h30, c'était assez calme au début. Puis ça s'est rempli petit à petit. Grosse surprise le choix musicale, les hits de l'année, ça change vraiment du sushi classique :D Pour ce qui est du service, déjà à mon entrée personne n'est venu m'accueillir. Il y a un mur devant nous et un comptoir sur le côté probablement pour l'hôtesse non existante. Donc il faut se mettre sur le côté afin de signaler sa présence. On m'assigne une table sans m'expliquer comment cela fonctionne, le menu est sur le côté et il y a une feuille à remplir avec des crayons. Ce n'est pas ma première fois dans un all you can eat sushi, mais comment le saurait-il s'il ne demande pas...? On commande la soupe, puis un assortiment de sushis, sushi pizza. Tout est bon, mais sans plus. Ce n'est pas wow, le seul sushi qui m'a supris a été celui à la mangue avec un coulis de mangue délicieux et rafraichissant en bouche. Le reste ne nous a pas impressionnés mon ami et moi :( Et nous avons été particulièrement déçus du service. Personne ne venait à notre table nous demander si tout allait bien, si nous avions besoin de quelque chose. Il a fallu qu'on se lève pour demander un dessert (la crème molle à la vanille qui était pas mal) et pour avoir la facture. Cela me dérange toujours quand j'ai à me lever pour signaler que j'ai besoin de quelque chose, cela signifie souvent que les serveurs n'ont aucun sens de l'observation. Alors c'est à essayer, mais sans grandes attentes."}
{"text":"Great food. My husband and I could not get enough. At one point we were full yet our tastebuds werent satisfied. Intense flavour. Great sushi. Loved the desserts. Pearl of japan is a must for everyone except ofcourse the diabetic. I havent had enough of this place. If only they had parking, You wouldn't be able to keep me away. I still feel like my tiny stomach had betrayed me. I couldn't even taste most of the stuff. Definitely recommended.  I give it 4 stars bcz of no parking. Otherwise you would have found me there everyday despite the price."}
{"text":"We were two people on a very busy Friday night. First of, if you're planning to come eat during a weekend night, you should call to make a reservation. The place is small, and gets compact and loud in no time with people. On this particular night, I was disappointed because their menu offered so much more than other Sushi AYCE restaurants, but their service was so slow... The amount of waiters/staff they had for the amount of customers that night was very little. At times, we had to wait 10-15 mins before getting our next order, and we had to ask the waiter about it in the fear that they might have forgotten about it. The waiters, however, were very kind and nice, but our service could have been better - e.i. We had to ask for more water, some orders never made it so we had to ask about it and remind them. The food, on the other hand, was okay - some were really great and then some are to avoid. They offer a variety of sushis you probably wouldn't find elsewhere, which I was so excited to try. But when our sushi plate arrived at the table, some were dripped and covered in sauce, making the sushis soggy and unappetizing to eat. The Maki Ceasar sushi, for instance, had lettuce in it, that was not fresh and the wrapping of the sushi itself was falling apart. Their yakitoris were a bit hard to eat as the meat was overcooked. I really liked their Shumais and dessert options - their soft serve ice cream was very tasty. Everything else we ordered was good.  If I would come back, I would not come back during a busy night... This place do have potential, but not in the conditions that I have witnessed this night."}
{"text":"Courteous service and clean tables. Large dining area - best to call in to reserve because it's a popular restaurant. Large selection of sashimi, makis, stir fried, fried dishes, etc., and I felt it was more varied than other sushi buffets. Also has more than 1 desert option other than ice cream - a rarity at sushi buffets. Very tasty food and quick service. Order via paper rather than tablets like at Sushi Crystal. Overall, no complaints here. A safe bet for sushi buffet."}
{"text":"I have to admit that being a big good sushi fan, I occasionally like to eat at \"all you can eat\" sushi places too. Takumi was actually a pleasant surprise for many reasons. First of all, the place is very nicely decorated, I guess it was recently renovated. Secondly, the service is super friendly and attentive even during that busy time I visited the restaurant. And the menu has few original items that I haven't seen in other places before. My favorite thing on their menu is spicy scallop nigiri...simply delicious. Yep, I will be back there again!"}
{"text":"Choix variés. Bon produits, belle presentation. Tres achalandé le vendredi soir. Bon service. À refaire prochainement."}
{"text":"\"Takumi\" means artisan in Japan. Apparently, it means something different in Montreal - because this Takumi is no takumi. There may be a sensible target clientele that goes for this - but I'm certainly not part of that set.  (Psychologically) adding to my meh-to-negative reaction to this place: one of my favourite restaurants in Japan is called Takumi-Okumura in the Gion district of Kyoto (http://restaurant-okumura.com/takumi/en/). That Takumi is legit takumi. I know this is a fundamentally unfair comparison but I found it hard not to think of the real Takumi when I tried this Takumi. Probably serves as an essential caveat to my whole opinion of this joint. Maybe somewhat akin to being anchored to the thought and memory of Michael Jordan while playing pick-up basketball with a little, slow dude with no hops called Mitchell Jordan. Yup, it may be tough to assess Mitchell fairly.  [Back to the name. Despite the fact that no one probably notices, the sole use of the word artisanal in the resto's name irks me. Like most misleading advertising does. How would you feel if the Dollar Store called itself the Artisanal Boutique? Or the Takumi Boutique?]"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give Takumi more than two stars, I was very excited that a new AYCE had replaced Sushi999, but it turned out to be the worst AYCE experience I've had in Montreal (and I've gone to almost every place in the city, several times). But there are some positive aspects here, so hopefully they can improve  Let's start with the positives: the service is great. The waiters were super polite and very attentive, really above what you would expect from an AYCE restaurant. They have a few items that differ from traditional sushi menus, like cream cheese fritters and shumai, we didn't try all of them but those we tried were good.  Also their miso soup is really good, not too salty.  But this is where it ends...  We came here for Lunch on a Saturday, and although we were seated right away, it took 30 minutes to get our sushi orders, and all the table seemed to be having the same problem. The waiters were very sorry about it and all, but still you could see everybody starting to get impatient.  Also the sushi was really BAD. I'm not a picky eater, especially not with sushi. It's not about being \"fresh\" or not, their rice is just terrible. Super dry and tasteless...it ruins the sushi. They really need to change their recipe ASAP. And the fish was kinda dry too, so yeah... The nigiris were definitely easier to eat than the rolls, especially the fried rolls like dragon eye, which were super dry and heavy.  The tempura was also terrible. Well, it just wasn't tempura. You know how tempura is made with a lighter batter, well this was the same batter as onion rings at any fast food. I don't know if you can tell from the pictures, but it was much heavier and simply did not taste like tempura.  I feel bad writing such a bad review because they really do have impeccable service, but they need to do something about the cooking, both in terms of speed and of quality."}
