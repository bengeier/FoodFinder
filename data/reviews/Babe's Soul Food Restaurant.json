{"text":"I really do dislike writing bad reviews, but nothing about this place rocked my boat. The service was mediocre, especially since everything I tried to ordered like the fried chicken,  turkey ribs, and smothered chicken were all out for the day. The lady taking my order had her grand kids there and they were rushing her to leave and she looked like she didn't want to be there or take my order. I settled on fried fish, dressing and macaroni, which didn't take long to cook and by taste I can tell why........

The fish was a little flavorless, so I drowned it in hot sauce, the macaroni was beyond awful, it was a little soupy and bland as well. The dressing had great taste, but you could tell it was heated up in a microwave because the top was steaming hot and when I got to the bottom, it cold like it had been in the refrigerator. I was disappointed to say the least. The meal cost me about 10 bucks and I was more than pissed after leaving and seeing a sign for specials of the day that I wasn't even told about for 8 bucks that got you a dessert and more in your meal!! Not that it would have been worth it, but for customer service it would have been nice to have been told, especially as a first timer."}
{"text":"So upon me finally getting around to writing this review I was informed that this establishment is  now closed permanently and for good reason. The owners are very VERY unprofessional and only seem to cater to the black demographic. I stepped food in a \"soul\" restaurant and I have never felt more unwelcomed in my life. She called me \"miss white girl\" and I should have known right then and there I was in trouble.

I went ahead and placed an order for mac & cheese because thats what I was craving at the moment. Who can screw up Mac & cheese? who you ask? THIS PLACE! it was spoiled, the cheese was old and I promise you the macaroni noodles were hard as rocks. I was disgusted and when i questioned the owner she told me if I didnt like her style of cookin maybe i should go closer downtown and get more food of my kind. Food of my kind?! Nah. In 2017 I shouldnt be profiled, I shouldnt be disrespected when I am patronizing your establishment. Lesson learned. Thankfully they are no longer in business. hmm I wonder why. Karma comes around and around."}
