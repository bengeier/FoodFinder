{"text":"Let me just say I am a wing aficinado and Rooks has it going on. I ordered cajun extra crispy with the fresh cut fries. Celery & carrots w/ blue cheese. The I tried was Great Lakes \"Elliot Ness pale ale very good beer. My wife had the mild buffalo with fresh cut fries celery carrots w/ blue cheese. Her beer leinenkugel \"Summer Shandy\" We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here because it was listed as a best steak salad place by my FB friends. Steak salad was awesome. I have also had tacos and waffle fries which were cold. The rooks grilled cheese with bacon and tomatoe was the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Good bar food. The waffle fries are good. I had fish, wife had a bacon cheeseburger. We were satisfied. Baseball and other sports enthusiasts will enjoy looking at the walls."}
{"text":"Rook's is a good local hangout with the usual \"bar food\".  Service is always good.  I usually get a steak or chicken salad after some appetizers.  Steak is always cooked to order and chicken tender and juicy not like jerky that you get at other places. Hubby gets a burger which is just a frozen patty.  Chicken Tortilla soup is to die for.  Finding out that the soup is purchased in bulk and not homemade was a disappointment though.  The atmosphere is a bit dingy and could use some updating and a fresh coat of paint."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great wings - no more Rooks - try the Bridgetown Taphouse which is now open just down the road.  Better than Rooks ever was by far.  MMMMM"}
{"text":"I was really excited to visit Rook's under new management. They have expanded the menu. Scrubbed the walls, floors and tables, enhanced the lighting but forgot to train their servers. I could cite specifics but will leave it at... hands on management and daily owner presence will increase the effectiveness of the help. If left to their own, they staff will only strive to meet the minimum standards. I know they can do better."}
{"text":"Rooks has basic food, not great, not horrible but basic. To sum the place up...short and simple. Rooks is a decent place for food but a great place for the atmosphere. The wait staff and bar tenders are always great. They make you feel like a regular (I guess I'm one..lol)

I usually get the burgers and they are always good, the tortilla soup is great. Prices are not that bad, usually under $10.00 for lunch."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a few years so stopped yesterday for a fish sandwich.  Major mistake.  Price had doubled and quality had slipped.  The only thing I can say about the fish is that it was large.  A large thin filet of fish overly cooked served on a plain white bun on an empty plate for $9.50.  I asked for lettuce and tomato and was charged extra.  Ate about a third of the fish and took the rest home for the dogs who rejected it.  Won't be back.  Do yourself a favor and go across the river (I know this is a big deal in Pittsburgh!) to Fratangelo's in Moon Township and get a fish sandwich (\"to go\" only)  Half the price, freshly fried quality fish filet, and served on a Breadworks braided roll. Now that is a good fish sandwich!"}
