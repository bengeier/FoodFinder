{"text":"just went to a retirement party upstairs and the pizza was stone cold.  I guess there's no warming trays.  this was 40 minutes after party began."}
{"text":"Worst experience in 20 years of visits to Champaign! Will never eat Papa Dels again. Doug, the so called mids 30s mgr with 45 pieces of flair on his cheap hat is low life ignorant loser. When my group of 18 complained about it taking 1:45 for thin crust pizza and water he copped an attitude, walked off, then tried to act tough lol. The pizza sucked, service was worse and doug is pathetic. #Never Papa Dels!"}
{"text":"I live in downtown Chicago and I eat deep dish and stuffed pizza weekly. However, the best Chicago pizza is in Champaign, IL. It doesn't get any better than Papa Del's. Call ahead or prepare to entertain yourself at the table for 45 minutes. Their jukebox is killer; it has near discographies of many great bands, like Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin."}
{"text":"I've loved Papa Dels since 1971 .    I have lived in California since 1975 and there is no better pizza in Chicago , New York  , and definitely none in California.   We have it frequently whenever we visit C -U and my 4 kids in their 20's now all love it.  We have had it delivered to California and even that is good.   As far as service is concerned you have to realize they deal with a lot of students who order and don't show up  or come in with lots of changes to their order or changes to the number of people they say will be  there."}
{"text":"While I think Papa Del's takes ridiculously long to prepare its pizza, there's definitely no equivalent Chicago pizza in this county. The deep dish reminds me of home and is massive enough that my Georgian friend was initially scared to try it. Spinach deep dish is my favorite."}
{"text":"Wow! The new location is really awesome. It's really spacious. Nicely decorated. The Big 10 Tournament was on all of their tv's...they're everywhere. We got there and there was a pretty long wait. I can't say I wasn't expecting it, it's been open THREE days. I guess we all really missed our Papa Del's.   The bar has plenty of waiting room. The staff was busy, but really attentive. I'm really happy with their drafts. They had my favorite, Left Hand Milk Stout, my hubby and friends were happy with Revolution's Fist City. Cheers to the staff at Papa Del's for picking out some really great drafts! Nice selection for a lot of different tastes. Yeah!   Okay...our pizza took a while. They have barely been open and I can only imagine it's going to be more efficient as the new staff gets acquainted. Be smart- As soon as you arrive you can place your pizza order at the takeout counter. They offered it at the old location, you should do this here, too.   They have some new items on the menu. I look forward to trying more of them. We got the garlic donuts. HOLY COW. The bottom of the bowl is filled with olive oil, fresh parsley, and chunks of fresh chopped garlic. Dang. Delicious.  We ordered our favorite pizza, the Sicilian. It was as good as it's always been. I'm miserably full, but super happy.   Remember....this is a brand new place with lots of new staff. It's going to take a bit longer than it would before. However, the quality is NOT lacking. Our server, Lauren, was really awesome. We talked to Andrea, Papa Del's daughter. She could not have been more gracious and polite.   I'm really excited for the new location. It's closer to our house. The space is open and modern. I can't wait to go back. For now, I've got some leftovers in the fridge. That will last a little while, not long I'm sure."}
{"text":"Used to love this pizza when I was there for school. Excited when I found out it could be shipped. But $96.00 shipping for one pizza? $136.00 total. You've got to be kidding me! They need to talk to Amazon."}
{"text":"While I don't quite call Papa Del's Chicago-style, more of like Chicago-style, it's still really good.  (Yes, I'm picking nits ;).  They really are the best pizza in C-U."}
{"text":"15 minutes to get seated when half the tables were empty on a Sunday afternoon. Pizza was microwaved. I was curious why the plate was hotter than the pizza. And why the waitress would need an oven mitt to bring a slice of pizza. Hopefully they hire some decent managers to make the new place a decent place to go. In the meantime I'll eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"OK forty years ago, an amazing deep dish pizza that took two twenty somethings to barely finish a small pizza. Today, same amazing pizza, two sixty somethings a bit more than half a small. Pretty special  to find a place making the same great food for forty years.  Oh, they moved from Wright St to Green St for you other sixty or something year old grads."}
{"text":"As you read the reviews, most are about the Chicago deep dish.  My family likes thin crust and we were still amazed at how good the pizza was.  Wow!!  I'm staying in town for work for an extended period of time and I can say, despite the fact they didn't deliver to my specific hotel and I had to do carryout, I will be ordering from Papa Del's weekly for the next 6 months.  Great value for the money as well."}
{"text":"Very good deep dish pizza. Unlike Chicago-style deep dish, this crust is not flaky and buttery like a Lou Malnati's pie, but it's still very good- just a different style. The sauce is a bit sweet for my taste, but still good. The cheese is good (seems to be just mozz). They seem to use high quality toppings (have only had the pepperoni and sausage). Call ahead to place your order (menu on eatcu.com) so you don't have to wait an hour at the restaurant. It doesn't seem particularly clean....but I guess that's to be expected for an on-campus eatery that caters to easily satisfied students."}
{"text":"If you want good pizza in Champaign, Papa Del's is the place to go. Their Sicilian Pan pizza is some of the best I have ever had. They also have half price slices everyday from 3-4 p.m. Can't beat a deal like that!"}
{"text":"It was OK. This might be my personal preference. I ordered a regular deep dish with sausage. They could have put more source. Basically dough was a bit overwhelming. I have had better deep dish pizzas at other places."}
{"text":"Best Pizza you're gonna find outside of Chicago in the C-U. Deep-dish style pizza.  Order during lunch hours to get discounted slices for only $1.50 (carry-out only).  Don't be cheap and order One World or Antonio's. Papa Del's is King."}
{"text":"This is the place to go to in Chambana for deep dish pizza, hands down. Make sure you are prepared to wait because perfection takes time. Their thin crust is decent, but not up to the same standard as their deep dish. Looking forward to visiting their new location when it opens!"}
{"text":"Papa Del's is my favorite pizza restaurant, and definitely worth the wait. For delivery, I've experienced it taking everywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours to arrive, but I'd say it is most often 45-60 minutes. If you are planning to dine in at the restaurant, I would recommend calling the restaurant about 20 minutes before you plan to be there to pre-order your pizza. This significantly cuts down on your waiting time at the restaurant. Take out is the fastest option. My pizza has always been ready within 45 minutes of placing my order.  The deep dish \"pan\" pizza is their specialty. The toppings are always fresh and delicious. I order garlic on every pizza I get from Papa Del's because it is just so fresh and delicious. I'm not a big sausage fan, but I enjoy theirs very much. My favorite combination of toppings to get is garlic, sausage, black olives, and green peppers. Yum."}
{"text":"Dining-in: it's crowded, loud, and the service is awful. I get that the pizzas take a while, but that doesn't mean that everything else should, too. I've never had a polite interaction with the staff here (nothing outrageous, but for a Champaign \"staple\", one might think that the staff would be a little more gung-ho about being such an attraction to visitors... yes, you, I saw your roll your eyes at me when I changed my order mid sentence. Rude!).  Ordering-in: A good experience because I can avoid the cramped seating and the impolite staff. Deep dish holds well as a reheat option the next day. Their sausage pizza is really delicious.  One plus: I have friends in Chicagoland who love this pizza and if we're in Champaign for a visit, we bring back Papa Dels. It travels well.  Overall: If you're in Champaign, yes, it's the best deep dish there is. If you're from anywhere else, you can do better."}
{"text":"I ate at Papa Del's on a Saturday lunchtime. It was about 40% full. Service was quick and friendly and the food arrived fresh but only luke warm: I prefer my pizza piping hot, do that was a bummer. I had an hour for lunch and so I ordered a couple slices of Chicago style pizza, which arrived in about 15 minutes and gave me plenty of time to polish them off and head back to work. The pizza itself was itself was pretty tasty (for a quick lunch) and I would definitely consider coming back when I had more time to wait for a freshly made deep dish (which, we were told, takes about 60 minutes to make and bake)."}
{"text":"Go with the Sicilian Pan.  We've been eating here for years and it never disappoints.  Be ready to wait 30 to 40 minutes for a pizza, but it's worth it.  Beer prices are not bad and service was great."}
{"text":"Finally made it to the new Papa Del's.  After hearing some not so good reviews, we were a little nervous.  Thankfully we had a great experience. I was impressed with the renovations and look of the place, although it's  noisy once it got more crowded.  Our server took great care of us.  The pizza was still the same great Papa Del's pizza, although I felt like the bottom crust was slightly thinner.  Definitely try the fried garlic donuts and save any leftover garlic sauce for dipping your pizza crust!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Delicious. I eat way too much of it! They have Shiner Bock on tap, which is another plus. Yes, it's a wait, so go with a group of friends and order some pitchers while you wait. Or get take-out or delivery if you don't have time to be social. But don't miss the goodness."}
{"text":"We like to eat here on our annual visits to campus. I have loved the pizza since I was a student at Illinois.  Sorry to say that we won't be back.  Even with the larger location the service is the same story- painfully slow. They are clearly under staffed for peak hours.  3.5 hour event.  Just can't do it anymore."}
{"text":"So Papa Del's is an institution, yada yada.  And it really probably is the best pizza in town---if you know you're coming for a heavy, Chicago style pizza experience.  The thick crust is classic Chicago style and is excellent, while the thin crust isn't really that thin but is also quite good.  I usually go with their thin crust, knowing it isn't like a New York Style or anything but is instead a less bready version of their excellent deep dish offering.  Their sausage topping, in particular, is always worth getting.  That said, I'm not sure I recommend eating in.  They are often crowded, their service can be *very* slow.  Get takeout instead.  Also, their parking lot looks like a giant bomb went off in it.  Watch your car!"}
{"text":"Only one word: Breadsticks.  This is the best place to get pizza in Champaign. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The pizzas are huge, and seriously large men cannot eat more than maybe 2 slices of the deep dish.  Being from the Chicago area, this is basically the closest you will get in Champaign to Chicago Style Pizza.  It's a beautiful thing."}
{"text":"Dined in with 6 people total. Ordered two pizzas took 2 hours to get. No explanation or compensation given, even though we asked numerous times how long it would be. None of the employees seemed to care or were told not to. Either way we won't be back, I like Rosatis better anyway."}
{"text":"The best Chicago-style pizza anywhere is not in Chicago. On one trip to Illinois we had Lou Malnati's, Pizzeria Uno and Giordano's pizza, aka the trifecta. Then we visited my family in Champaign and grabbed a couple of slices of cheese pizza to go from Papa Del's before driving to O'Hare. We inhaled them in the car, and I swear, that beat those fancy Chicago places hands down. I love all kinds of pizza...East Coast, West Coast, you name it...but when it comes down to it, it's Pop's for pizza or no place at all ;-)  Oh yeah, and order take out. Don't judge this place by the dining experience;  just get the pizza. I lived in C-U for the first 17 years of my life and have gone back once or twice a year for the last 20. Of the hundreds of Papa Dels pizzas I've had, I can probably count the number of times I've eaten there on 2 hands. Who cares?"}
{"text":"Good deepdish, only ordered delivery there."}
{"text":"I would give a negative if I could.  After waiting for over an hour for our food we found out the waiter never put our order in.  If you have Jacob as your server please make sure to check on your order multiple times.  Of the tables around us he messed up 3 orders.  I hope that is given more training."}
{"text":"THE WORST service I've ever had.   Went there for my husbands birthday. Waited an hour and a half for our food and THEN learned that the waitress forgot to put in our order. She told us 20 min prior that the pizza would be 5-10 mins and brought us our plates.   There were maybe 5 other tables in there, so it wasn't a busy night.   The manager offered to give us our food, but we couldn't wait another hour. The waitress never apologized, the manager didn't seem too concerned and made a point to tell us what we owed for our drinks.   Pizza is great but the service was horrendous. Never going back. Probably won't even order to pick up again... So disappointed."}
{"text":"First pizza they brought out was completely wrong. I did find a couple pepperoni in my deep dish but was sorely missing the rest. Crust was burnt? I've had deep dish before, but this was soo dry as to be inedible. I'm not sure if this was normal or what.  but won't be going back."}
{"text":"So I was there for an hour and a half waiting for pizza. We decided to take the pizza to go.  When we got back to our hotel we realized they messed up our order. I would give this place zero stars if I could. And the waitress was very unapologetic about the wait. She put the pizzas on the table and walked away."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying: I LOVE this pizza!   Ok, that's where the love stops.   The service is terrible. Not just terrible, awful even!   You arrive, you place your order. You enjoy a beer, maybe another. The server comes back to get your order. Wait, I already ordered? You place it again, waiting...waiting.   Finally, after an eternity, a manager comes out: \"she forgot to put your pizza order in.\" Really? Seriously? After placing it twice? We order again. 40 minutes later, we get a pizza. It's delicious. But, we could have been in Chicago for the time it took to get. And then, at least, we would have been in Chicago.   I \"suppose\" if you like to complain and feel you want to wait a small eternity for a pizza (that's delicious!) go to Papa Del's. However, if you've had your fill of being treated poorly, find somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I debated between one and two stars here, but decided on one since their product has declined so miserably. I came to Champaign in the 80s and one of the most eagerly anticipated food experiences in town was always Papa Del's pizza. Over the years -  especially the last 3 or 4 - our pizzas have been overcooked over half of the time. On two occasions we returned them since they were literally burnt. As time passes, you try to forget and reorder, but enough is enough. How can so many of their cooks be incompetent? Probably barely invested, temp. student help. Too many other options in C-U to put up with this so frequently."}
{"text":"Papa Del's is the shit. Hands down the best pizza in Champaign. The pizza they make there is delicious the service is awesome.   I agree with the dude from Peoria, AZ, if you want fast service, do go to pizza hut. What separates Del's pizza to Hut's pizza is the attention to detail the pizza you eat at Del's gets. There is a process t making their pizza. True can be said of Pizza Hut's, but Del's is deliberate and the end product is a pizza you can be proud to eat. I have eaten here 3 times and I loved it every time.   Not only is the pizza delish, the place is immaculate. Walking in the restaurant, you are transported out of Central Illinois and to a different region of the world. There is a great contrast and this adds to the experience. There is a fountain, the tiles look like its from Italy, the two storied dining area gives the place a cool feel to it.  The pricing is just right. True, to a person used to eating at Antonio's, Pizza Hut, or Sbarro, the pricing may seem high, but consider the quality of food compared to Papa Del's- not even close. So, it is well worth the extra few dollars to eat here. Plus the pizza is so damn filling. So, when you think about it, you are paying for your food for the day and possibly tomorrow.  The only reason why I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because although they do accept credit cards in the store; they do not accept then for ordering out. I called there and I got less than desirable service. I wanted pizza to order out one day because I was too lazy to leave my apartment, but whatever, I wound up just walking back to the restaurant and ordering my food there. They should accept credit cards over the phone. But, that's about all I have to complain about.   To summarize,  Best- Great food, excellent service, unique looking place, big portions, reasonable price  Worst- Don't accept credit Cards over the phone"}
{"text":"I haven't had any other chicago deep dish pizza, so I don't really have anything to compare it to but this was really yummy. Seating is an issue sometimes, but it's worth it if you want to treat yourself to some good, hearty pizza. There is a long wait for the pizza because it has to cook for about 45 mins.   I suggest getting the sausage on the pizza. It's really really good.  I'd probably give it five stars if the seating and atmosphere were a bit better, but it is what it is...a little pizza joint."}
{"text":"Papa Del's Disaster: Or, How I Learned to Cook My Own Slice  Papa Del's (or, as I like to say, Papa Odell's Down Under) is a slow restaurant to eat at.  I hope ya like slow cookin'.  I had to say, \"Papa Del's? More like, Slow as Hell!\"  More than that, their chairs are made outta just about the hardest wood you ever did see.  I was dining one day with my good friend Buddy, and Buddy always said, \"If ya get a hankerin' for some downhome pizza, please come with me and we shall sit at Odell's.\"  We arrived there in good time.  But then, things took a turn. For the worst.  For 'starters', our waitress miss was takin' a fancy to that chef.  I went to the bathroom and I saw them on the balcony, she was twirlin her hair all over the place, and he was covered in sauce.  Nary a pizza pie in sight.  And then the party arriving after our fine selves was seemin to be served first.   IT WAS A CATASTROPHE!  I WAS SO SORE ALL OVER RIGHT FROM SITTIN ON DEM CHAIRS.  45 Minutes later, we got ours. It was Deelicious.  My only wish was that that waitress missus wouldn't've talked to that man so much.  They were so slow and then some and a half.   I do not recommend dinin' there unless you got the time.  Otherwise, snap on down to Taco Bell.  They's be timely in most high fashion."}
{"text":"I had the deep dish and it was the best pizza I have ever had.  It is not a Chicago style pizza with the buttery crust and reversed ingredient order it is more of a deep dish with some sauce on top. I have had all of the standard Chicago pizzas (Gino's, Lou's, Giordanos) and I prefer Papa Del's and it is not even very close."}
{"text":"You know Papa Del's must be good when the owner of  the place can be so, so rude to customers and they keep on coming back for more.    The Papa Del's horror stories that I know of first-hand and have heard (all from reliable sources) range from being hung up on over the phone while trying to order take-out to customers actually having their cars towed from the parking lot.    And still, I am giving Papa Del's four stars.  Why?  Because everytime I bite into that first thick bite, I am once again surprised by it's woderful deliciousness.  Papa Del's is to pizza what a wife-beater is to marriage.  They'll break you down and disrespect you, yet somehow they have the power to keep you crawling back, begging for more.  Please don't leave me Papa Del's!  I have been blacklisted from the delivery list once before (long story, I learned my lesson) and I never want to go back there again!  If loving you is wrong, Papa Del's, well then, Baby, I don't ever want to be right."}
{"text":"The food was great. My cousin took me here saying it has some of the best pizza in town. And she was right! But one star less because it took an hour to make a whole pie. So go when you have plenty of time!!"}
{"text":"We had friends in from out of town. We stopped by on their way out and ordered a deep dish. 55 min to get our pizza, which is fine until we noticed it was not the right pizza. They offered another in 55 more minutes. Which was not an option for us. We grudgingly ate the pizza. One person in our party was not able to eat it.  I spoke directly with Papa to discuss price.  He has one rule regardless of situation. He also said they follow the rule to the letter because of college students. I'm over 50 and am not trying to take advantage of a free pizza. My biggest issue from the whole experience is that I was treated poorly with no respect. Nice Giordanos is now in town!"}
{"text":"I went there with my family after the High School state championship games. After waiting to be seated we ordered our pizzas because the waitress advised that they take a while. About a half-hour later she brings the first of the two we ordered. She then tells us I have some bad news that may be good news. She tells us she gave our second pizza to the wrong table however if we still want it the other table only ate a couple of pieces and we can have it for 50% off! I thought she was kidding but she was completely serious. I told her that was pretty gross and that we wanted a fresh pizza. She puts the order in and 45 minutes later the pizza still wasn't at our table although most of the people eating had left. Finally it came 50 minutes after she reordered. I asked to speak to the manager. The waitress came back and said the manager was busy and would only come out if we really wanted to talk to him but he would give us a discount. I told her I wanted to talk to him. A few minutes later a kid comes out of the kitchen wearing gloves and holding a spatula. I told him what happened and how long we waited and he said sorry. That was it. I told him about our waitress offering a partially eaten pizza and he said he talked to her about that.  I am pretty sure she got someone from the kitchen to come out and not the manager. Long story short they took $5 off after we spent 2 hours in the restaurant. I will never go back  Observations: The restaurant is dirty and needs a good cleaning  The whole restaurant is dated and the finishes are worn out.  The wait staff is clueless, obviously because nobody manages them. The only reason the restaurant is still going is because there is no real competition.  Trust me go somewhere else where they want your business and maybe they clean once in a while.."}
{"text":"The customer service there has always left something to be desired.   The pizza CAN be pretty good.  Sometimes you just get that craving for it.  Unfortunately, it's not always the best.   It tends to get over-cooked sometimes. And you don't really know until you break into it at hime. Tonight will by my last experience with Papa Del's.   I ordered it to be delivered.  I've had it delivered to this same location before since they moved ino the new South Neil location.  The last time I had it delivered, it was over-cooked.  But I gave it another shot because I was in the mood for some big fat pizza. An HOUR after ordering, I get a phone call from Papa Del's saying that they don't deliver to me.  I asked when that changed because I have had them deliver to me before.  The manager said nothing had changed.  They've never delivered out here.  I live on North Neil.  The store is on South Neil.   So now I have to wait ANOTHER hour, at least, while I find something else I want delivered, and cross of the places that wont accept deliveries now because they close their doors at 9pm. Maybe its better if you dine-in, but I wont be able to review that, as I will never be giving this place my money again"}
{"text":"Pizza was great, service was terrible. Forgotten orders,  no refills for water, no pen to sign receipt (no receipt for one of us until another 10 minutes passed)...  I know this is a college town but service like what we received on a night that wasn't even busy is really dissapointing. Save this for carryout your dining experience is sure to be subpar."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I was excited that Papa Del's was taking over this cool building and making it a \"destination\". I went there for the first time today.   The building is very nice, with a well thought-out interior. But, there are big problems with the service model here. There is a host/hostess there when you arrive, but the method for them to determine if there is an available table seemed to be for them to walk around and look for one? We could have done that ourselves. Cmon, get a better system up front. We were taken to a dirty table with no offer to clean it. There were lots of un-bussed tables, which looks so bad. My husband had to go to the clump of gabbing servers and ask for someone to wipe the table down.  It took about 10 minutes for the server to finally get to us. This was on a Sunday afternoon at about 1:15. They were not terribly busy. It seemed other diners were brought water, but we were not, only the sodas we ordered. We ordered by 1:30, two thin crust pizzas. We are familiar with the wait time for their pizza, and they set the expectation in the menu, stating a thin crust takes 30 minutes. (Why? Does the pizza oven not function properly?) Silly me then, for expecting it to land on the table in 30 minutes. ONE HOUR AND 15 minutes is how long it took our LUKEWARM pizza to get to us. By that time we were very hungry. But I was very upset that after all that time the pizza had obviously sat and cooled off. It's so clear that the dining room service will actually kill the business that has taken 40 years to get where it is. What a shame. I will NEVER go back there. There are too many places to dine that get it right to frustrate yourself as a customer at Pap Del's.        It might be better to make the in restaurant dining more self service. Have customs order and pay at the counter, with pizzas brought out to a number on the table, fill their own drinks, and bus their own tables. Service will kill this place. Too bad."}
{"text":"I feel that Papa Del's is overrated, although certainly not a bad pizza place. I ordered pizza at the newer location on Neil St and the pickup time was estimated at like 1.5 hours. Okay this was not too long after it opened, so I figured they must be really busy, etc so the next time I called about 1.5 hours ahead of when I wanted to pick up the pizza and they said the same time (1.5 hours). When I showed up to pick up the pizza there were several other customers waiting that were angry about the timing and the staff told me it would still be a half hour or so. Not a big deal, but a little frustrating. Anyway, about an hour later (2.5 hours total now) the pizza was ready. I should have checked it right away but I took it home instead. When I got home and opened it, I noticed the whole pizza was black as if it had been cooking for 2 hours!  Anyway, I have yet to have a good experience since the new larger store on Neil has opened..."}
{"text":"We arrived at 6:45 to find out we had a 45 minute wait. The only reason we stayed was my brother was in town to visit before shipping out to Saudi Arabia in a few months and really wanted Papadels.  The hostess suggested placing a pizza order while we wait, so I did. The 45 minute wait was over an hour. After being seated, we waited 10 minutes before our server came by.  I told him we placed our pizza order an hour before. He took our drink order. 15 minutes later he brought our drinks. I told him again about our pizza. He said he will go check on it now and left.  After waiting some more, my brother got up to check with the carry out counter about our pizza. It was still in the oven!!!! Really?   After 2 hours of waiting, one pizza finally arrived. My husband's small thin crust vegetarian pizza arrived after the rest of our family finished eating out party size deep pan pepperoni pizza.  The pizza was average but hot. The service was not good.  Wait several months before dining in at this new location. I will not be coming back. It is too expensive for the average food and poor service."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night after hearing two years of rave reviews. I was surprised..I really didn't like it much.  Don't get me wrong, it was ok pizza. Def not worth the hype though. I ordered a pepperoni deep dish and it wasn't so much deep dish as a gigantic ball of dough with a smidgen of cheese and sauce. We ended up peeling off half the dough because it was only ok and there was so much of it that's all you could taste.  Not sure why so many people are crazy about it..I love good deep dish too. Grew up with Lou Malnati's in my home town and this stuff wasn't even close."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you have any sort of time constraints. The only reason I'm not giving this place 1 star is because I didn't actually get to taste the food. I came here for lunch knowing that there would probably be a wait. But, I was craving some chicago style pizza, and I had an hour so I thought I'd be fine.  I walk in and stare at the 2 workers in the place for 5 minutes. Finally he asks \"Can I help you?\" Something about the way he said it just rubbed me the wrong way. It felt like he thought I was intruding upon his precious time. Granted, the restaurant was pretty full, and they seemed understaffed so I just asked for a table. He told me to \"sit tight\", which I did. I sat tight for at least 15 minutes without anyone paying any more attention to me. An update on time would have been really nice. Even just saying a word to remind me that I hadn't become invisible would have been appreciated. Of course they were too busy running past me to say anything though. After wasting 20 minutes of my lunch break, I gave up and left.  Hopefully I can come back and actually try the food. But, the service here is really poor from what I can tell. The pizza better be amazing; otherwise, I don't think I'll be tempted to come back here."}
{"text":"People of Earth,  For the first time in my 30 trips around our sun, I have signed up for Yelp to write this review.  I found myself at Papa Del's as a \"welcome home\"  treat after a tour of duty of service with the U.S. Navy.   However,  I am not writing a review about the Navy.   I am writing a review about Papa Del's.  As a pizza connoisseur from Chicago I expect a certain standard when it comes to my deep dish pizza.  I expect foremost, the number one most important thing to be the Pizza I ordered.  Alas, Papa Del's failed to achieve this simple and customary task.  I came to Papa Del's exclusively for a quality Deep Dish Pizza.  The Pizza I received was a lukewarm  thin crust  brought to me by the Hostess (not my server) which brings me to my next  priority when it comes to pizza, Quality.   Why was my pizza lukewarm? Why was it thin crust?  Why did the hostess bring it to me and not my server?  why was it not a gooey fresh out of the oven, carb-loaded Italian-American, deep dish high caloric cheesy goodness that, when consumed in high quantities, contributes to diabetes and heart disease.  Why?    If I ever go to Papa Del's again, I will only expect the correct Pizza fresh hot out of the oven... once type and temperature criteria are met,  I will raise expectations.    Why was my pizza brought to me by the hostess and not my server?  I do not know, but I do know that I am eating out because I'm too too lazy to cook in my own kitchen and don't feel like doing dishes.  That is why I pay a premium for dine in service.    Caveats:  this was the third day of the grand opening of the new Papa Del's;  there are many kinks that need to be worked and staff to be trained.    Papa Del's posted a warning sign for longer-than-usual waiting time.  I appreciated the politeness of the staff when they informed us about a high volume of patrons and it will be a long wait.   \"How long of a wait?\" I ask.   \"50 minutes give or take 15\" was the answer I received.  So here I am expecting approximately an hour wait.    The Navy fosters the ability to wait.  That said,  after having a very delicious slice of cheesy garlic bread and wine while standing near the bar,  1 hour and 45 minutes of waiting caused me  to inquire how many people were in front of me.   I am told that I have 6 parties still in front of ours and hostess asks me when I ordered my pizza?  Wait a second... I was supposed to order my pizza? I normally order when I sit down at a table but... I suppose it does make sense that I was supposed to order already as the last thing I want of have a Pizza that is lukewarm by the time I get because it was ready before my table and was drying out under a glow light before I get it... Sorry, thats my fault I'll take that hit.  So I order my deep dish sausage,pepperoni, green pepper and onion pizza. \"Oh we're sorry sir, but we are out of green peppers\".  Out of Green Peppers?  Well, suck it up, civilian, it could be far worse.   After another 20 minutes elapse,  our table is ready.  Wonderful.  it then takes another 10 minutes for the server to arrive. We family orders a large Italian salad, a bottle of wine and 3 glasses of water.   The wine came in a reasonable amount of time as well as the salad -- except we still lacked plates, enough flatware, and quality H20.  After another 10 minutes the missing water, hardware, and plates arrived.  Logistics!  As my last critique,  I have to state that I hold cleanliness to reasonable standards. The new Papa Del's was very clean and I have just one complaint.  From the bar's vantage point, I observed a  (presumed) staff person walking around the kitchen in blue jeans and a leather jacket with long free-flowing hair.  I presume this person was  going off shift as he grabbed a boxed pizza and left.   Seriously pal don't walk through the kitchen scratching your head, especially without a hat on. Gross.    I will summarize:  after a much-too-long wait,  we received the wrong pizza that had been sitting out, while basic eating accessories were neglected and greasy biker staff walked through the kitchen.     Papa Del's recognized the negative issues associated with our three-hour gastronomic epic,  apologized, and attempted to fix the error by comping  half the cost of the wrong pizza and along with an abandoned deep dish pizza with mushrooms on it.  I hate mushrooms.  But a courteous effort was there.  With a few cycles of improvement, Papa Del's might be worth a future visit."}
{"text":"Wait time is too long just to get a table.  Pizza took over an hour to the table.  Also way to pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Sounds good but wouldn't know. They won't deliver to us even though we're 2.1 miles away."}
{"text":"On Thursday 9/21/17, at 5:14pm, I ordered a single large pizza for pickup.  I was asked to provide my first name, last name and telephone number.  I  s l o w l y  spelled my last name and had to repeat it to the female order taker.   I was told it would be 40 minutes.  I arrived 45 minutes later, gave the guy at the counter my last name (he asked for my last name).  He couldn't find the name in the system - the girl had completely butchered the spelling and he finally asked for the phone number it was ordered under.  He said, oh there it is.    So he asked me to wait and he would call me up when it was ready.  Another 20 minutes passed by and still no pizza.  He kept asking my name.  Upon watching the pizzas coming out of the kitchen and put into the heating unit, I see a pizza sitting on the top shelf with my first name on the box.  Are you kidding me???  When he looked up my phone number, you would think he would have put two and two together and realized the pizza was prepared under my first name!!!  But no, 65 minutes after I ordered, I was the one who had to solve the mystery of where my pizza was!    Why the heck do you ask for a last name if you aren't going to put the order under the last name.  I'll not be back - and besides the pizza wasn't that great."}
{"text":"I'll NEVER go to either of the Papa Del establishments again.  After paying $50 for two pizzas that I waited almost 1.5hrs to have delivered, I received subpar products (overcooked and poorly made).  To make things worse, when I called to give feedback and ask for some kind of accommodation, I was talked down to by one shift manager Rob and hung up on by another Mark.  After 20 yrs. of patronage, I expected better.  They have lost my business forever and I'll be sure to let the owner Bob know exactly why!"}
{"text":"Show me a better pizza that Papa Del's. SHOW ME!  It simply does not exist.   If you want clogged arteries and a big belly, this stuff will meet your needs quite well. It tastes pretty awesome, too, probably because they run up to Chicago daily to buy fresh produce at Fulton Street markets."}
{"text":"Their pizza is amazing and goes quite a long way. 1 deep dish slice is a meal in it's self. Their deep dish tastes even better heated up in the oven the next day. It does take awhile to cook the deep dish. So going there starving is not recommended."}
{"text":"Papa Del's is good, but not great. I'd take Jupiter's over it, but it's a local staple, so it might be worth going just because it's a staple in this community.  The Chicago-style pizza is good, for Chicago-style pizza. I mean, it's a glorified casserole, and really saucy. You're essentially eating bread with marinara and cheese, but if that's your thing, go crazy. I prefer the thin-crust options, which are solid, if unspectacular. The beer list is passable, as well, though there's a bit too much of the Big Three for my tastes."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, the closest thing to Chicago deep dish in the area as far as I know.  The problem with this place is that the owner/manager shows complete contempt for the customers.  There are signs posted all over the place admonishing customers for this, that, and the other.  They will actually tow their customers cars if they park in one of the spots closest to the back entrance which they reserve for their delivery drivers (aside: isn't it customary to have your employees park at the far end of the lot to reserve the good spots for your customers?)  The first time I went in to pick up a pizza, I was a bit taken aback bu the \"get the f out\" vibe.  Since then, I've heard a lot of horror stories from employees and customers about the way the owner treats people.  My favorite involved kicking out a family with an infant for bringing in outside food to feed the baby.  The kid had a bag of freakin' Cheerios.  I heard this from an assistant manager who ended up quitting because they just couldn't deal with having to treat people that way anymore.  I've given up the tasty pizza on the premise that I'm really doing the owner a favor.  He clearly hates his customers, so now I'm one less thorn in his side."}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza here is good. I am not from Chicago, so I'm not into deep dish pizza in general. Compared to other deep dish, I think this pizza is ok at best. Too pricey given the quality. Look elsewhere for affordable pizza that isn't a chain."}
{"text":"All of those giving Papa Del's one or two stars, I want to fight you.  Especially those of you knocking it down because of its service... here's the thing... you go to Papa Del's for the best pizza you have ever eaten.  You want fast service? Go get a pizza at Pizza Hut express and leave one more table open at Papa's...  The secret is, call ahead.  It does take 45 to 55 minutes for them to cook a pizza, that's how good (and thick) they are.  This place is, hands down, my favorite pizza ever... however if you are especially anal about service, just get it delivered.  Whatever you do though, if you are in Champaign, don't leave town without tasting this true circle of cheest awesomeness."}
{"text":"Regionally famous pizza. Still pretty good. Cool new facility. Rude / apathetic lady at the register. Kinda made me wish we had gone somewhere else. Looking forward to Giordanos opening here. Papa Dels needs some competition to sharpen their game."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite pizza place. Every time I come back to visit my hometown, I make sure to order a large Sicilian pan pizza with sausage, garlic, and black olives, with a side of pepperoncinis. Delivery time is usually 60-75 minutes, and I don't mind the wait because the pizza is heavenly."}
{"text":"After graduating from UIUC Grad School, I often go to sleep thinking about this place. Their thin crust pizza's are my favorite. I also get the Italian Salad to go with it. They have excellent beers in bottle and on tap. I miss the days on a wintry night, either during or after the blizzards, where a cold beer and a hot pizza combo seem to do the trick to fill the void of the depressing winters. I can't thank them enough for helping me get through a tough time period in my life by serving a great pizza and beers. I came here alone to do my readings by the fire pit or with my peers for a social night. Either way, both types of customers are welcome."}
{"text":"I have taken thin crust lovers and even vegetarians here and all agree that it is some of the best pizza they have ever had.  I particularly like the italian sausage.  If it is your first time there, be aware that you won't get your pizza until about 45 minutes after you order and its not cheap.  Just be prepared to inhale it when you get it."}
{"text":"I am not one to write many reviews and have never given a 1-star but this is an exception.  I have been to the new location twice since they opened and both times the experience was really, really bad. The wait staff is in chaos, people are leaving after sitting and waiting for a server to even greet them after 15 minutes, orders are wrong, and the list goes on. Overall this was a big move for Papa Del's to a much larger location but thus far I would say this has been a big fail and significantly damaged their reputation in the community."}
{"text":"I'm a 40 plus year resident of Champaign-Urbana and have enjoyed Papa Del's pizza for many years.  The move to the new location seemed like a positive.  More space, parking, etc.  Unfortunately they have a lot of personnel problems that still remain despite now having been open for several months.  Because of the long wait for a table, and then the long wait for a pizza, we decided to order a pizza from the take-out counter and go to the bar for drinks.  My girlfriend had a beer and needed a second (it was a 1-1/2 hour wait for the pizza).  Her empty bottle was on the bar.  Server 1042 dutifully removed the empty bottle without asking if she needed another.  What kind of bartender does that?  He later had an argument with a customer over the quality of a drink that was made.  Don't argue with customers, make them a new drink, apologize, and move on.  I then went to check on the status of my pizza.  The girl went back to check, left me standing at the counter for 5 minutes, came back, didn't look me in the eye and proceeded to do something at the cash register.  I asked her what was going on with my pizza.  Watching employees, they are in need of some good training and/or management.  A positive, server 867 was very good, gave good service, answered questions, and was very friendly."}
{"text":"Move back to the old place because you definitely ran a tighter ship then now in your new digs. Hostess station with two girls that obviously didn't know what they're doing except avoiding guests and constantly yawning and walking to sip juice in the back. 3 pizzas ordered and we waited for 2 orders of fries for an additional 10 minutes. Please put glass doors on your warming box because it was needlessly opened about 20 times looking for orders which made our pizza seem soggy instead of crisp. If you decide to go be my guest but be forewarned being too big only created weak hospitality, service, & product."}
{"text":"Had to carry out pizza because the place was too crowded. The pizza took about an hour to make, but it was worth it. Best pizza in the area that I've had so far."}
{"text":"We used to love Papa Del's at the old location, so decided to give the new one a try. We want to warn you that we had a terrible experience in every possible way--bad service, painfully slow on food, food not hot, no serving utensils, and dirty bathrooms, etc. We waited AN HOUR for a thin crust pizza. Perhaps it was ready in the 40 min. they state on the menu, but had been sitting in the kitchen, as it was not served hot. Nor was it served with plates or something to serve the pizza with. We finally got plates, but never a serving utensil. (Good thing the pizza wasn't hot I guess.) The bathrooms are filthy (toilet paper everywhere, dirty seats, graffiti, etc.) with no towels to dry your hands (both machines were broken). My daughter ordered an orange juice and she was served concentrate--it was literally syrup. We said it was undrinkable and were told that they don't really have orange juice, it was just concentrate from the bar for mixed drinks. Our server offered to dilute it for us, but it was still undrinkable. He finally took it away, but charged us for it anyway. The server said he'd had many folks seated at the same time, so that's why the service was so bad. But there were many empty tables. And it's really no excuse for all the problems: a pizza that takes an hour after ordering to arrive at the table, serving drinks that are not drinks, not coming by to check and see if we needed anything (more napkins), bringing a beer 15 min after it was ordered (when we were almost done with the pizza), and serving food before plates or anything to serve it with. Really, really unpleasant dinner. Must be terrible management and training. We will not be back. Too bad."}
{"text":"Their pan pizza is very good, nothing special though. I guess I may be spoiled form Lou Malnati."}
{"text":"This is the pizza I was raised on.  It is the pizza to which all others will be compared until the day I die.  And I sincerely doubt any will ever compare.  When I visit home, my parents say, \"what do you want us to cook?\"  To which I respond, \"Huh?  We're getting papa del's, aren't we?\"  The chicago style is awesome.  But the thin-crust is overlooked IMO.  It's what I grew up eating.  And is still my first choice.  The crazy good sausage, the oozing gobs of cheese.  Oh my, thank goodness we're going up for the Michigan game this weekend.  I need a fix.  And yeah, we were up 2 weeks ago.  And had Papa Del's.  Your point would be?!?  Word of warning--on a Saturday night, while school is in session, easily a 1 1/2 hour wait for the pizza (even in the new West location).  Is it worth it?  Are you kidding me?  I'd wait days for this pizza."}
{"text":"Papa Del's serves some kind of corruption of deep dish. I'm not even from the chicago area, and I can tell that this is not authentic. I've even had frozen deep dish pizzas from county market that tasted better. Papa Del's pizza is really dense loaf of bread with a layer of cheese on top with a thin layer of tomato sauce applied on top of that. This is a place that I'd recommend going to once just to experience, but save your money for better restaurants."}
{"text":"Pizza was good.  Called ahead and was told it would take 45 minutes, but actually took 1 hour, 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Good deep dish pizza, a little bit on the pricey side but well worth it. It takes a while to get a deep dish side, I recommend ordering ahead of time before getting there."}
{"text":"Had a big birthday at Papa Dels on October 10. Anthony was great we had around 40 people. He kept everything straight and still had time to keep drinks filled and everyone happy. He needs six stars for himself. If ever have a problem talk to the manager they will do there best to fix it. Also plan on 45 minutes for the think pizza. It takes time to be perfect. But with garlic donuts how cares about the wait."}
{"text":"The service was terrible and when they lost our order for a second pizza they had us wait around an hour and a half before telling us what happened.  To keep us from complete outrage, the waitress promised a free pizza of same value in the future.  When I called to redeem this free pizza, I was told that the pizza would be half off instead of free.  Terrible service and lying, that's all I have to say."}
{"text":"Oh Papa Del's how I love you. Get the deep dish stuffed pizza (stuff it with spinach) and add pepperoni uuffffff :D Perfect.  Thin crust is also excellent, and it's good with sausage on it."}
{"text":"green street location is closed.  Called number and guy said they only now have the location in village green plaza."}
{"text":"Great Pizza! I was in Champaign for business and this place was recommended to me. It is well worth the money for amazing deep dish pizza!"}
{"text":"Yeah, this pizza is amazing. The deep dish pizza is a long wait - at least 45 minutes - but you can call ahead to get your pizza started. Highly recommended. But you can load the pizza with all kinds of toppings, and they're baked right into the copious amounts of cheese they give you. Couple that with a buttery, flaky crust that you are seriously happy to eat, and you have a winning pie.  Pair the pizza with some cheesy garlic bread to start the meal, and the attentive service will keep your drink full while you wait. Anytime I go back to Champaign, I gotta have Papa Del's."}
{"text":"My parents introduced my brother and I to Papa Del's when they took me on a pilgremmage to Champaign for Homecoming when I was in high school (we're from Iowa).  We were young, naive, and whined about the wait.  But as soon as we finally tasted the pizza, we were believers.  I've has Chicago style pizza... and this isn't a substitute, it is the best.   This is, hands down, my favorite pizza in the world.  My family drives 2 hours out of the way on an 18 hour car trip to SC just to stop for Papa Del's on the way down, in the middle of the night.  Homecoming is a month away and my mouth is watering just thinking about this place!!!"}
{"text":"Papa Dels is a good, solid, pizza place. They make good pizza and thats what they do. The pizza takes a while to make so either order ahead or get an appetizer and be ready to chat for a while. I generally prefer pick-up and just eat at home with friends and a movie or game.  Papa Dels has two styles of pizza - thick and thin - both are excellent. So if you don't like Chicago style, don't forget to try their thin variety."}
{"text":"The ambiance of a 7th grade cafeteria very loud very drab I will never be back if you enjoyed High School you will love this place I will be dining at Fiesta"}
{"text":"It's not what it used to be. Crazy mentally unstable delivery driver cursed us out and refused to deliver our pizza. Management made good and fired him and sent us another, but ended up having to file a police report against the psycho driver after he kept calling and texting and harassing us all night. Definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Well. The new restaurant is beautiful. The pizza is still really good. It takes forever to get your pizza-that hasn't changed. I really wanted to give the new location more stars because Papa Del's has been an institution in the Champaign-Urbana for more decades than I care to admit knowing about.  I always look forward to their pizza. I have 2 issues. 1) if it takes SO dog gone long to get thru the queued up orders (we placed ours long before we were seated) why aren't these pizzas delivered to your customers piping hot?? Why aren't all hands on deck to make sure the pizzas get to the tables before they get cold?? There are plenty of servers trying to look busy. Believe me. I knew that it would take forever. But, the reward for patience should be a hot pizza!  2) in the very long time we sat waiting for our pizza I counted no fewer than 4 empty tables at all times while hosts/hostesses told people that there would be a 90 minute wait. Not sure if this is the way to keep the kitchen from being overwhelmed. Clearly, there are still some serious kinks to work out in service."}
{"text":"OH yeah.....you know that Chicago Style Pizza is the only kind of pizza that can be called a meal.  New York Style, that is a lunch kind of pizza.  If you want a real meal, then Deep Dish is what you want.    And if you can't get to Chicago to have some Lou Malnatti's and are in Champaign / Urbana then you have to go to Papa Del's.  Just beware, this delectably deep dish pie takes 55 minutes to bake.  If you are hungry and need the quick hit of Chicago's best food then call ahead.  But if you are like me and can let a great meal take its due course, you can order a pitcher of your favorite brew and enjoy that while taking it easy and conversating with your friends.  After all, Deep Dish Pizza is all about sharing, because no man, and I mean no man can tackle a Large Deep Dish Sausage by himself.  The only reason why this place gets a 4 instead of a 5 is because their Shiner Bock was flat, the service was not so great, and they are not in Chicago.  If these things were remedied, they would easily be a 5 star, but sadly rural Illinois is not Chicago...."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious but the restaurant needs a better organization system.  Down for a busy game day, they could have been better prepared. I guess there aren't many places to get this caliber of pizza so maybe they don't have to improve, they seemed to be the only restaurant in town. If you're in the area, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"I too wish I could give this less than 1 star.  We were seated quickly that was the best part of the experience. Our waiter was manic like he couldn't help us quickly enough.  We needed time to look over the menu as it was our first time at this establishment.  His incessant pen clicking had me just as irritated as the 3x he asked if we were ready to order in a minute and a half.   I ordered pizza by the slice...big mistake. The pizza was  was dry and its appearance was less than appealing.  I ordered ranch for my crust and it was like water.  I understand making your own ranch dressing but at least try to get the consistency right.  Ratio of powder to water is important.  My husband ordered an order of garlic bread that was just dry toasted bread.  No butter...little if any garlic he said.  It was our first and last time at Papa Dell's... sorry."}
{"text":"The new building is nicely remodeled.  Unfortunately it took about two hours to get lunch served and we didn't even order pizza. The server was covering way too many tables and simply could not keep up with basic service. Management appears to have understaffed both the kitchen and front of house. This name and the pizza are legends, but they need to improve the dine-in experience or the brand will be badly tarnished."}
{"text":"Not much to say other than that we love this. My wife and I always choose this pizza, so far our favorite in town. We go stuffed with spinach and are always satisfied.  One caveat: the wait can be long (delivery often takes over an hour, so plan ahead or don't bother when you're starving)."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited the new Papa Del's location yesterday for the first time. We previously had ordered carry-out from the Crossing location and never felt like we received great service.  Last night was a pleasant surprise. We were promptly seated in the bar area. The bartender checked on us often and was very friendly.  We enjoyed the local craft beer offerings --- a mix of Triptych, Rigg's, and JT Walkers with other great Midwestern brews thrown in (Revolution, Bell's, etc...).  We split a small original pan pizza and took half of it home. So filling! You must try the sausage! We also ordered breadsticks and took most of them home, too. We ended up essentially getting two meals for the price of one with our leftovers.  There are tons of TVs in the restaurant so we will likely return to watch some football this fall."}
{"text":"Pizza was good but we waited waaaaaay too long. We were told 1 hour, actually took 2 hours to get our food and spent a total of 3 hours in the restaurant. I don't think we'll be rushing back anytime soon. The old location never took that long, even on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Awesome dough - it might take a while but their cheese is totally worth it.  A full bar makes it worthwhile."}
{"text":"this is the best THICK pizza I have ever had since the first time I came here in 1972 when we dropped off my older sister as a starting freshman at U of I. It is very different from Chicago Deep Dish pizza...this is Sicilian I dream of this pizza and if I lived any closer I would be dead from eating it way too much. I see some of the other reviews were whining about it taking so long to cook....oh my, it is amazing how some people need their food fast and do not respect the time it takes to make something of true quality. I go simple here, sausage and garlic....but any pie here is awesome in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"we came shortly before noon and the tables in the front area were full. our order took too long. it was for one cheese slice and a gluten free pizza for me, not difficult. my wife got bread sticks but that was the last we heard from our server for over an hour. we asked that our pizzas be boxed up. it came a few minutes later. I thought that my wife's slice of cheese was very thick and had a lot of pizza sauce.  I understand that they have just started the gf crust, I would still prefer monicals or Jupiters for gluten free."}
{"text":"Over two and a half hours for a delivery. I called once and was told it was on the way. After another half hour I called again and was told the driver knocked,we have a doorbell, and then left since we didn't answer. I was sitting in the front room waiting on the driver.  The driver had supposedly been here 15-20 minutes prior to my second call. I spoke to the manager and was given a break on the cost, cashier brought pizza out. The pizza was cold and not prepared the way i had ordered it.  The manager told me she would check to make sure pizza was ok as I had expressed concern over the quality since it was in a car for so long. . I know some folks have had issues with Pops but this was my first and hopefully the last."}
{"text":"this place rocks for artery clogging deep dish pizza.  being from chicago, i do miss deep dish pizza, and this doesn't disappoint.    the bread sticks are good, too.  however... the pasta?  meh.  it's nothing to write home about.  to be fair, this place isn't called papa del's pasta... it's called papa del's pizza, and they live up to the name.    the only thing i would say in a cautionary tone is... if you're ordering for delivery... be prepared to wait.  this pizza takes awhile to prepare, and if you're ordering a big one -- it takes even longer.  if you're starving and expect it to just show up like domino's -- you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the legendary stuff in CU.  Some people love it, some tolerate it, but many yearn for it years after they leave campus.  The place can get very busy, I usually call ahead and carry out since the space itself is loud and frankly not too memorable.  I love the tomato sauce and cheese taste.  Many people overlook the thin crust, which I like, esp. when I don't want the volume of the pan.  The stuffed is too much for me.  Surprisingly, the sandwiches are a cut above what you would expect at a place like this - an afterthought.  A note:  Years ago they used to have a location on Wright. St. where they sold sandwiches and slices.  That was nice, and convenient.  Wish they could do something like that again.  Maybe take over the McDonald's spot in the Union food court.  Honestly  - how could McDonald's not be successful there?  It seemed busy whenever I was there."}
{"text":"Papa Dells pizza pales in comparison to real deep dish pizza. The crust is very thick and not flavorful. The sausage and pepperoni toppings aren't anything special. I do enjoy the amount of cheese they put on their pizza. If you want the Chicago pizza experience don't waste your time here or money."}
{"text":"Best deep dish Chicago-style-pizza I've had anywhere south of I-80..."}
{"text":"Worst waitress ever, I wish I could remember her name!  Never thought their pizza was worth it anyway, but other people fall for the hype and I get dragged here only to hear the others in my group think it was just ok pizza.  Don't fall for the hype, and I typically get bad service every time I am forced to go here.  Thank god Giordano's is coming!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've never been inside the restaraunt, so my rating is for their Sicilian deep dish. I will literally order their deep dish twice a month, and eat it for a week. Not only is it so affordable, but I'm able to choose 5 toppings for a medium pizza for only $22. I'm taking one star away because depending on which cashier I pick up from, they may or may not charge me for the crushed red pepper."}
{"text":"Yum.  If you have to drop your son or daughter of at U of I, you can still expect first class pizza...BEST tip I can give you is ORDER AHEAD...takes a long time(they do say it on the menu, about the time, but still does not make it easier watching everyone around you shovel in very tasty pizza)-salads are decent...service is so-so...not dirt cheap but not crazy expensive...pizza is wonderful..."}
{"text":"Second-best in deep dish pizzas (second only to Pequod's in Chicago), Papa Del's is the best in the Champaign-Urbana area. You can eat in-restaurant, take a pizza to go, or get it delivered: any way is perfection. Do not skip this restaurant on a trip to C-U."}
{"text":"This University of Illinois campus fixture has the \"best\" Sicilian pizza due to the crust, cheese, sauce & sausage -- not to short change any of the other additional ingredients (pepperoni, mushrooms, etc) or the \"thin\" pizza, or the cheese garlic bread, or the...  OK, I'm a fan... since the late 70s (oh, am I showing my age).  A proof point is that while driving Columbus, OH to Chicago I went through Champaign just to pick up a pie to go.  4 stars, versus 5 is due to the ongoing problem of \"table management\" during rush periods where tables will be \"empty\" between seatings while there is a line of people waiting out the door & around the corner.  That being said, once seated, service has been consistently good through the \"generations\" of waitstaff that we have had. And other than football weekends, seating has not been a problem. The bar is fairly well stocked.  Oh, this last round, I had bacon and it was 1/4 strips on the pie -- FANTASTIC."}
{"text":"Still the worst customer service in Illinois. Came in on a Saturday afternoon at 3:00. Was greeted by Mr. Zero Personality, who had to confer with Mrs. Zero Personality to determine where in the vast vacant dinning room we could be sequestered to.   I had preordered a pizza and was told 45 minutes to make. Told the guy we would be an hour, he said they would keep it warm. Ok.....   Took us an hour to get here from that time, so i felt pretty good about our chances. What i didn't count on was sitting at a table for 10 minutes before our server acknowledged us.   I asked a question about the Maplewood Son of Juice IPA. His response was \"What is that, a beer?\"  So I'm guessing you can't tell me if its fruity.  \"I don't drink alcohol,\" Well la-de-da, guess I'll just wing it.  The beer turned out to be ok, but the wife's ice tea took another 5 minutes. And apparently water is by request only.   Pizza cane out a few minutes after our drinks, was luke warm, and had a crust that tasted like it had been in a hot box for half an hour. Toppings were very good.    Took another 10 minutes to get our check after asking for it. Waiter saw me typing this review and went into the silent treatment. I had to carry out our leftover pizza in napkins."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the staff is great, and there is a ton of seating space but the food is not what it is all hyped up to be. One of my coworkers enjoys think place so much, our boss gave him a $150 gift card for his 20 years of being with the company.  I've never liked the parking either even when the building was a different restaurant. Their pizzas have way too much breading, the sauce is mediocre at best, and overall just seems like there is way too much going on. It's like they are compensating for something. Less is definitely more but you won't get it hear in my opinion."}
{"text":"The staff is nice but service is slow. Food is good as well.   We were told it was a 25min wait but prob only waited for 10 min. We ordered the deep dish pizza while we waited to get that going (deep dish sausage).   Once we got seated my family prob waited about 15min for the server to get to us. He did acknowledge us and said he'll be right with us but it was still slow. The server was nice though.   Once we ordered, we were hoping the pitcher of beer would come pretty quickly. But then again, another 10minutes or so for it to come out. We also ordered the chef salad with the chicken, but when he dropped off the salad he told us he gave our order to the wrong table and he gave us theirs (they ordered a house salad, so the other table def got an upgrade on their salad). But we got our correct order and the extra salad was on the house.   The pizza was yum! What I liked most was the crust/bread. So good!!!! Nice and fluffy!!!! But them carbs def makes you full to the max. I had one slice and I was done for. An 8 slice pizza is enough for 4 adults.   Oh and don't bother with the mozzarella sticks. Nothing fancy or out of the ordinary.   So overall, everything was good. The service was just slow."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best of the best. The smell alone will carve a hole in your stomach, it's so good, esp when you are hungry. I started with PD's in 1980 at UIUC, then left UIUC in 84, and came back several times for, er, 'business reasons', but the truth, I now admit, was to eat another deep dish Papa Dels pie... that's how damn good they are.   Don't bother taking a frozen home...I tried that and wept it was so not the real thing.  The tomato sauce and the crust are some special recipe, for which if I could get ahold of it, I would start Papa Dels Silicon Valley and make trillions."}
{"text":"Slightly overrated, but pretty good stuff. The food and beer is expensive for the C-U. Better than Giordanos. Get there early and be prepared to wait b/c it is popular and can get very crowded, especially on fridays."}
{"text":"Papa Del's is my favorite stuff crust pizza ever.  Oh man... back when I was in school, it used to be a real treat to go here.  Usually, if someone was visiting and had a car, this was one of the destinations.  The pizza takes a LONG time to make, which is expected.  But it's SO delicious.  I live up in Chicago now, but I haven't forgotten you Papa Del's!!"}
{"text":"I went with a large group of friends on Halloween weekend. Pretty much everyone except for me and Husband went to the U of I. The out-of-towners in for Halloween insisted there was only one true C-U place for lunch: Papa Del's! They lauded the deep-dish-by-the-slice. I was warned it would be crowded, but I'm willing to walk into the fires of Mt. Doom for some good pizza.  My experience: Meh.  So, I think that people really love Papa Del's because that's where they went in college. It brings back fond memories of late nights or drinking or whatever. I get that. I am very nostalgic for certain college hangouts of my own. However. Papa Del's pizza SUCKED.  I might be a bit unfair in my review. It might be amazing if you get a fresh pie made. It could be incredible. But the slices we got at 1:30 pm (after 20 minutes wait)? SUCKED.They were hardly warm, yet still had dark-brown spots from spending too long waiting to be served. Husband had a sandwich, which he said was decent, but everyone had talked up this pizza. Said it was better than Vinny's, better than Rosati's, etc. WHAT. It wasn't inedible, but I was far from impressed.  Service wasn't outright rude, but also wasn't fantastic. I get it, it's lunch rush on a Saturday. You're used to getting treated poorly by college kids. Still, I expect a certain level of positive attitude from waitstaff. I certainly don't want to be treated like I'm a burden upon you because I chose to eat at your restaurant.  In my opinion, if you aren't a current UIUC student, or someone going for nostalgia, there are better pizza places on campus."}
{"text":"Papa D's, as I like to call it, is the most awesomest (deep-dish) pizza in Champaign, if you order 90 minutes before you're hungry.   Papa Del's is an institution in Champaign-Urbana. I've read reviews that say it's not as good as Chicago's own Chicago-style. To that I say Bull-hocky! You're just hating on Champaign because you're here for school and you miss you're hometown! I've had Papa D's deep dish and Gino's East in Chi-town. Side-by-side I don't think I could tell the difference.   I've never ordered a thin crust or a sandwich at Papa D's so I can only speak to their most beloved menu item, the Super-Stuffed pizza. (The pizza President Clinton ordered when Air Force One landed in Champaign). I have nothing to say other than it's awesome. It's great. It's the bee's knees. It's the spider's web. (does that last one make sense?). Seriously though, if you like stuffed pizza, get a Papa Del's sausage (or pepperoni) and spinach (unless you hate spinach).   Two big draw backs to Papa D's: It's on campus. So us townies can wait to sample it's offers three times a year (spring break, summer break, and winter break), or, or!, order from the NEW, NEW! location at Village at the Crossing (you're welcome Papa D, call (217) 359-5500). I've never ordered from that location, but I've eaten that location's pizza and it's just as awesome as the Green street location, minus the students and traffic.  The other big drawback is the delicious deep-dish takes a while to create and bake, so you have to be patient or order ahead of time. If you dine-in at the Green Street location you can plan on waiting 90 minutes if you're in a large group. Alone or in a smaller group the usual wait time is closer to 45 minutes. If you order-out or arrive when the students are gone you can expect to wait less.    BOTTOM LINE: Great food + long wait time - fair price - \"I can't believe you haven't tried this already\" = worth it.   If you live in Champaign more than a year and you like pizza, I won't respect you if you haven't at least tired Papa D's (stuffed pizza)."}
{"text":"There's really not much more I can add to the great reviews of this place, other than my experience: I've had pizza literally on every corner of the planet, and Papa Del's is the very best deep-dish pizza there is. There are thin pizzas that can lay claim to better, but when it comes to the incredible stuffed pie at Papa Del's, there's honestly nothing else that comes close."}
{"text":"It's Pops for Pizza or No Place at All.  Seriously - this is the best pizza you will ever have - deep dish, that is.  And yes, I've had Chicago pizza at the \"institutions\" and this is still way better.  Beware though, the place is insane on weekends and it takes 45 minutes to bake a pie so call ahead if you think you're going to be bored talking to your table-mates for that long.    I would give Papa Dels 5 stars but the last 3 times I've been there, the service has sucked - not the rude sucky, but they have jacked up our order every time!  We want thick, they give us thin. We wanted pepperoni, they give us sausage.  This last time we asked to see the manager and tried to at least get a free 'za out of it - \"no free food here - owner's policy,\" he says.  Normally this would piss me off so much I would never go back, but the pizza is just so damn good I do anyway.  Sigh."}
{"text":"Wow fantastic deep dish pizza in a really cool space.  Anyone who knows anything about good deep dish pizza, knows that it's not a fast food item - about thirty minutes.  So no complaints from me about how long we waited for our pizza.  In addition to pizza we also ordered a couple of salads and a meatball sub.  I know you want to hear about the pizza though (the star) so I will start there.  We ordered a pepperoni and mushroom deep dish.  We first wanted sausage but they use the sliced sausage which we aren't fond of so we switched to pepperoni.  The crust is different from the crusts we get in Chicago - more like a white Italian bread.  It's yummy.  The pizza had a nice amount of cheese that really stood up to the crust.  We were very happy with our pizza and our topping choices.  The Caesar salad  I ordered was good.  I like the dressing which had a good amount garlic in it.  My husband was confused about the cheese on his American salad.  He didn't think it necessary.  With the cheese that was coming on the pizza he thought it redundant.  Let the cheese shine on the pizza instead were his feelings.  The meatball (from my understanding because I didn't have any) was good but ,neither my husband or son liked the green pepper on it.    Love the space.  Lots of TVs and a fireplace.  Had a hip/industrial vibe."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Papa Del's although it is a Champaign staple.  I was going to give 2 stars but i just couldn't do that.  ALOT of people love Papa Del's and have for many ,many years.  I am not one of them and I can't figure out why.  It tastes fine.  I just would not go out of my way to get one.    They are big and heavy and take a long time to cook.  Every time we have ordered one for work I have to wait when I arrive because it is still cooking.  Every time.  It's a messy kind of pizza too so maybe that's another reason I am not fond of it.  I would not recommend it nor would I discourage anyone from trying.  Seriously on the fence with this one.  My advice is try it for yourself then decide what you think and Yelp about it."}
{"text":"This has been a HORRIBLE dining experience. After waiting on our food for nearly 2 hours, we were served COLD pizza and the manager confirmed the pizza was not fully cooked. Another pizza was purely veggie and it has yet to come to the table. This was our first time at Papa Del's and we are certainly disappointed. This restaurant opened much too quickly and by the service we've experienced, I'm unsure how long they'll be able to stay open. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to ANYONE."}
{"text":"If you are not currently a student or younger they will not bother to give good service.  This is the third of my three strikes for this place.  I will NEVER go here again.  we sat for 1.5 hours without getting our pizza.  The server was busy flirting with some college kids at the next table and she said, \"sorry I must have forgot to put in your order.\"  We got our appetizer and it was cold, they said it was probably because we did not eat it fast enough. I mentioned the wait for the pizza and that they could cancel the order.  The manager came by and said we still needed to pay even though we did not get the pizza and the order had just went in.  SHAME ON THIS PLACE. Just like Merry Ann's; people go to these places because of tradition not because they get great service or anything that resembles food."}
{"text":"Picked up Ben and Brandon at tennis camp so had to stop here.  Plus you can get slices at lunch!  Giant breadsticks that are great also.  Pizza takes time if you order a whole pie - 45 minutes for a thick crust, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I had heard about Papa Del's and was excited to try it after reading the reviews. I ordered a pepperoni, sausage and mushroom (my go-to pizza). The parking was difficult to find because it's on the side of the building. Up the stairs is where you pay and when I got up there, the service was not very friendly. After paying and walking to my car, I noticed that the grease from the pizza was ooozing out of the box and dripped onto my jeans. I was fairly pissed about that, not only did it stain my jeans, but I knew I ordered a greasy pizza.  Deep dish pizza was pretty good, but there was soo much sauce and not enough cheese. I usually enjoy pizza, equally if not more on the second day of eating it, and this pizza was not very good on day two.   Overall, I'm not sure if I would go back, but I'm glad that I tried it. I think there are better pizzas around town."}
{"text":"It's the best pizza I have ever had.  I haven't found any pizza that comes close to it.  The buttery crust, delicious sauce, generous cheese - it just comes together superbly.  If you're a vegetarian (the grease from the pepperoni/sausage does magical things) or like thin crust or are cheap - don't bother.   A lot of the 1 star peeps are talking about service.  The service is sketchy at best - I would always call ahead and pick-up.  It's so worth it.  If anybody knows a place in Chicago that is as good - let me know.  Malnati's and Giordano's - they're good, but not as good..."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite in Champaign. Chicago can't beat their deep dish. Uses good, fluffy pizza dough, and loads up with cheese and toppings. I'm in heaven every time. Sometimes, rarely but sometimes, they have it in the oven a bit too long and the bottom of the pizza crust is a bit crunchy. But there's so much crust, the entire thing is never ruined.   The breadsticks are as long as your forearm and are delicious. (I'm not exaggerating. They really are a bit longer than wrist to elbow on my arm.)   GARLIC DOUGHNUTS ARE THE MOST DELICIOUS CARBS I HAVE EVER HAD.   Last I went, they had cocktails too. Looking forward to try those guys out.  And I have successfully moved people across the country to live with me in Champaign by luring them in with Papa Del's and snow. When my friends or godfather visit from the east coast, we ALWAYS have Papa Del's. There's no way they would visit the midwest and not get a deep dish, and why go to Chicago when the best deep dish is here?"}
{"text":"The best pizza anywhere! We always stop when we are traveling through Illinois. The only complaint I have is that they used to have THE BEST ranch but they changed it and it just isn't the same."}
{"text":"Papa Del's provides the best Chicago-style pizza outside of the Chicago metropolitan area.  It is a must have for pizza fans who live in Central Illinois.  The main location offers dine in, pick up, and delivery and is located on Green street in Campus Town.  A new location has also opened up that offers pick up and delivery services.  You can purchase frozen pizzas, but they rarely cook as well at home.  PROS: Delicious pizza, reasonably priced for groups  CONS: Slow preparation time (45 minutes for thick crust), waiters aren't always the most attentive, restaurant atmosphere is nothing special"}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Champaign, my bro and I decided to get some Papa Del's to bring back to his place in Paxton for dinner... and boy were we in for a treat!  Being from Chicago, REAL pizza is either Deep Dish or Stuffed. Don't give me that thin garbage (thin is good, but its not za). I want to eat my pizza with a fork and knife, and Papa Del's Super Stuffed fit the bill!  Note: Please don't get me started on people who don't know the difference between Deep Dish/Pan vs. Stuffed. If you have a question, just ask, because I will thoroughly explain it to you.  Our order took about an hour, which is fine, because you can't rush perfection. Our total was very cheap too, because my bro acquired 20 coupons for a special deal.  I'll be honest, I was a bit skeptical because this is Champaign.... a very far cry from Chicago. Once you are south of 80... be very wary of Pizza!   now to the good stuff: the super Stuffed. It was fantastic! The crust looked sort of dry on the initial viewing, but on tastinhg, it was awesome. It has a nice chew, but was not chewy or crunchy. As for the cheese, the pizza had plenty, which was awesome as well. The sauce was very good too; it wasn't amazing, but it was seasoned nicely and did not just get dumped from a can (unless I'm totally !off, which I doubt). I actually wish there was more sauce, but oh well.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good papa Del's was. IT made me feel like I was still eating Za from Chicago, which is a very good thing.  Will I be back? You can count on it. The onlydecision I have to make: Their Deep Dish, or the SuperStuffed with Spinach (Only got cheese on this previous trip)? either way, I'm looking forward to it"}
{"text":"Great pizza at reasonable prices.  The place can be a bit packed.  Also, they don't deliver so you'll have to get it."}
{"text":"I grew up here and have been coming to Papa Dels since 1976. It sure has gotten mediocre.  Went here today for lunch and first off the restaurant needs an update (this building dates from the 1990s if memory serves when the original location on 6th St. closed). It's ratty looking with a huge stain on the ceiling where the wallpaper has peeled off. Fix it. How hard can that be?  The dough for the pizza (we ordered slices) has always been on the bready side, but I used to like that since it was moist and flavorful. This was dry as dust, lacking in sauce and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp forever. Blech.  And seriously. It's not 1976 anymore. A salad can contain something other than iceberg lettuce. It's even available here in the midwest now, if the local grocery stores are any indication. Use it.  My nephew ordered breadsticks that were just gross. Huge batons of bread (the pizza dough?) with a nuclear cheese or marinara sauce. They were completely unflavored. No cheese, garlic, butter or anything. Just batons of dry bread. Again, gross.  Sad that an old institution has gone so far downhill."}
{"text":"This is the worst place if you want pizza!  We ordered a deep dish pizza with sausage, mushrooms, onions and extra cheese.  Took 50 minutes, well that's not the problem.  It came out cold!  Sent it back, second time cold seriously!!!   Manager came over and he told is it was temped at 116 degrees!  Liars!!!   He said, well we have had complaints on this before, well I bet you have!!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. Waited over an hour for 2 pizzas and they're cold. The third was supposed to be gluten free but there was cross contamination and it was cold too. Don't know if it was the fault of the kitchen or the waiter and don't care.  I haven't been happy the last few times so this isn't an isolated decline in quality and service. Considering the price, this shouldn't happen."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD  Ordered a pizza for pickup. The order was not prepared correctly - I was told I could take something I did not order or want at 2/3 the cost (I was offered \"a few bucks off\") or I could wait another 45 minutes for them to re-do my order and I could pay the full price.  I spoke to both the manager and general manager and both were rude and condescending, and not once did anyone even apologize for the inconvenience. I will never set foot in their restaurant again."}
{"text":"Awful everything.  I need to find every social media site so I can warn consumers not to waste their time unless they like being treated like shit."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town?? This place was pretty pedestrian, and I am hoping it isn't this best in town. Our pizza was good. We got a thin crust pizza with peppers and ham or something like that. Maybe our problem was getting thin crust. I am looking forward to going back here to try the Sicilian style or Chicago style pizzas. What I am not impressed with is the limited toppings. How can people get excited about this place when they only offer about 10 toppings. I am used to more than double that."}
{"text":"If I could give lower than 1 star I would.  Worst dining experience of my life.  We waited over 2 hours for a thin crust pizza.  People at our table received their Pan Pizza's before we did.  Had to beg for drink refills and waited 30 minutes to pay.  I will never return."}
{"text":"The pizza was great, just make sure you get it and run.  The seating at the Windsor Rd. site consists of patio tables and plastic patio chairs haphazardly arranged in a small waiting area.  Not an ideal way to enjoy great pizza.  The paper plates and plastic cutlery they provided, however, was a classy touch."}
{"text":"Gross.  We ordered a pizza, and were told it would be 40 minutes. Ok, no problem. At 50 minutes I asked the waitress if it was coming out soon. \"5 minutes.\" Ok. 10 minutes went by, then another 10. We are now at an hour and 10 minutes, and still no pizza.  Another 10 minutes later-- now exactly twice what we were told-- she brings out a piping hot pizza with green peppers and mushrooms. Pity that we ordered a sausage and pepperoni pizza...  We were so hungry that we said forget it, we'll eat this one. Then we tried to cut into it. The bottom was rock hard, and burnt to a crisp. The knives could not cut through it. And in the center of the pizza, you ask? Yep--cold as ice. WTF?!  We called the waitress over, told her we'd pay for the drinks, but wanted to send the pizza back. 2 minutes later the owner is at our table, screaming at us that we are paying for the g-- d--- pizza. After attempting to calmly explain the situation, he said he didn't give a shit about that, he was getting his money. So I said, \"ok, sure, no problem. You go get the check.\" And we left while he went to get the check.  Then-- oh yes, there's more-- about 2 weeks later there is a knock at the door of my mom's house, although I no longer lived there. She phoned me and said, \"Um... the police are here about a pizza you didn't pay for?\" What a dick! (The waitress had known me in high school and knew my name). I told my mom not to pay, and that I'd deal with it, but of course she was just worried about me and paid it. So the asshole got his money for a pizza we didn't order or eat, and that I would not have fed to my dog. And I have never been back."}
{"text":"People kept saying we needed to try Papa Del's. We went and had a medium \"superstuffed\" with pepperoni and sausage. It came out a few minutes early and was cooked well. However, the pizza itself was nothing special, and certainly not the best pizza I'd ever had even in Champaign (Amano's does a better deep-dish, at least). Lots of cheese, but they were light on the toppings and there was way too much empty crust.  Good place to go with a group and hang out, it's pretty noisy later at night."}
{"text":"We've tried Papa Del's twice and were disappointed both times. The first time we had the thin crust, and the second time we had the pan pizza. Both were just OK and we honestly do not feel we need to go back here again. The toppings selection is not only disappointingly short, but also overpriced. Our expectations are high coming from Gainesville, FL where they have Satchels, the most amazing pizza in the universe. We are still in search of a pizza place that we love enough to want to return to again and again in C-U. We haven't found it yet, but we like One World Pizza over Papa Del's pan pizza and Monicals wins out for value for a thin crust. It's sad that Monicals could beat a local favorite for us."}
{"text":"Given the generally positive reviews this place receives, I was very much looking forward to trying their Chicago style deep dish.  However, I never got the chance because the service was so AWFUL!  My wife and I arrived on a Saturday night at around 8pm, so, granted, it was a little busy.  We told the hostess that we were looking for a table for two and, after lazily glancing around at about three tables, she told us there was nothing available and then just walked away! huh?   Thankfully, a waiter came over shortly after and found us an open table in about 10 seconds.  If only securing a table guaranteed actually being served food.  We were seated at a table pushed up against a wall and behind another family (I won't dwell on the fact that the decor is atrocious and reminiscent of a high school cafeteria - with decibel levels to match).  Well, perhaps because we were hidden behind another family or perhaps because of the staff's general inattentiveness, we were never waited on...nobody even came by to take a drink order.  I understand from the reviews that the wait here can be long, so I was willing to give them some slack.  However, waiting 20-25 minutes simply for someone to acknowledge your existence is absurd.  We really had enough when we started seeing people who had come in after us get waited on as soon as they sat down.  At that point we simply got up and left.    Perhaps the pizza here is really good.  I can't say for sure.  But if I decide to try it again, it will definitely be for take out."}
{"text":"Holy mackerel ! This was soooooo freaking good! Delicious! No...DELI-FREAKING-LICIOUS!!! I was a deep dish virgin and I am so happy to have lost it to Papa Del's !!!! We also had an awesome server who put up with my thousands of questions cause I am new to deep dish and their menu! Marissa you were stellar! I hope we get you on our soon-to-happen next visit. Great food for a great prize!"}
{"text":"ONLY good pizza in C-U.....takes too long, but its worth the wait......I can't believe anybody even orders that cheap chain garbage."}
{"text":"Two inch vertical Two pounds of waist-line per slice Pure deep dish delight  (First, I must make an odd observation about Del's.  I've NEVER, EVER, EVER been to a pizza shoppe that DIDN'T have 'suggested' pizzas on their menu!  No \"Hawaiian\", \"Supreme\", or \"Carnivore Lovers\" pizzas here... if you don't bring your own inspiration, then you're SOL at Del's!  The waiter gave me a funny look when I mentioned this, as if he'd never noticed this before.  Strange...  But back to the food...  This place makes pretty solid deep-dish pizza.  As with most deep-dish, it takes a while for it to come out, so plan your dinner time accordingly.  We ordered a large pizza, and each slice was practically a meal in itself.  It also reheated nicely the next day, which was a nice bonus.  The pizza WAS moderately expensive, but worth it.  Note:  I wasn't as impressed with their cheese-bread appetizer as I was with their pizza.  I wouldn't recommend it.  One other POSITIVE noteworthy addition:  I needed to break a $20 to get change for the parking meter.  The server didn't have the exact change on him, so he just smiled, gave me 4 quarters, and said \"Don't worry about it.\"  I don't see this kind of generosity very much.  It's only a buck, but it made my day.  Needless to say, he received a handsome tip from me!)"}
{"text":"During every trip to Champaign, I feel obligated to have Papa Del's at least once.  Sure, it's not quite \"proper\" Chicago pizza, but it's pretty close, and it's also what I grew up with.  Living on the west coast, I wish we had something this good."}
{"text":"It's good pizza... but just good pizza.  It's not GREAT pizza.  Unless you have some sort of college-esk sentiment about the place, I'm not sure it's worth the always-promised hour and a half wait.  But like I said, the pizza and breadsticks are good, and if you have all the time in the world, knock yourself out."}
{"text":"Ok. I should've submitted this review along time ago. I don't see what all the rave is over this place.  Everytime that I go (which is mostly over the lunch hour) that pizza is barely warm! oh and it aint that good! That is all."}
{"text":"i was a fan. probably had 500 pies from papas. Saturday I had lunch there, spent $50 and since I left my car in the lot for the football game, I was towed and $225 towing and $20 taxi ride later I headed back home. That pizza was not $300 good and I will not be back. maybe give customers who eat lunch a pass for their dash? request a $20 local charitable contribution on top of a tip for a space? plenty of ways to make this a win for everybody. meanwhile I'm done there."}
{"text":"I haven't had pizza this great in a long time. I came here with a 3 others and we all got a small pizza for ourselves. It took about 45 minutes for the pizza to arrive but it was well worth the wait. Their thick pizza is in a class of it's own. The service was also very good, our server prepared our food to go for us when we were done and was very nice. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I LOATHE Deep Dish Pizza. I have grown up in the Chicago metro area and have enjoyed most of the staples, like vienna beef hot dogs, italian beef, and gyros. However, I am a minimalist when it comes to pizza, and so, I like as few things on it as possible. The very concept of deep dish pizza goes against this philosophy of mine, almost to the point where I wouldn't even consider it pizza at all.  Regardless of that, I will gladly eat a medium sausage deep dish style pizza from Papa Del's any day. Yes, Papa Del's serves the only deep dish pizza I will eat anywhere. I think that's a good enough endorsement.  Don't overlook their thin crust pizza, though. It's every bit as good as the deep dish in my opinion and it's a solid option for the lighter appetites.  I can't really say the service itself is bad like all of the other reviewers are saying. However, you will probably wait at least 45 minutes if you are ordering a pizza of any kind, so be warned."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Absolutely horrible.  I stopped in for lunch.  I had an hour.  The garlic cheese bread was good, but didn't need to take forty five minutes to arrive, and my two slices pizza? forget it?  And I'd have chalked it up to the pizza taking time, but then why did the two tables that came in after us and ordered similar slices GET SERVED FIRST!?  Hell no.  The service was...meh.  They were friendly but clueless and were completely flustered when I said, \"I'm late, I have to leave now.\" Worker: \"But your pizza is ready now!\" Teej: \"Way late, but I'll take it to go.\" Worker: \"Uh, wait, I'm gonna need a minute to change it up.\"  Sweet Odin's Beard, woman!  Put it in foil and a bag.  It ain't that hard.  UGH.  You suck Papa Del's.  And you know what else, I found the pizza to be...okay.  I'm not from Chicago, I know, but I do like deep dish, and I found it to be only okay.  Perhaps that's because I was rushing now to class late thanks to you, Papa Del's.  You suck and I hate you."}
{"text":"The deep dish was the best.  Make sure you order an entire pie,  they take about 40 minutes so allow you self some time but it's worth the wait.  If you order by the slice it's premade and not quite as special but by the slice is pretty awesome as well."}
{"text":"Place makes legit deep dish pizza. No one does it better in champaign. Only place to go for piazza like this down south. Lunch special legs you get their piazza slice for like three bucks. Great deal for a hungry college kid"}
{"text":"If you ever went to Champaign/Urbana- this man made your day! He's the 69 year old ,If you ever went to Champaign/Urbana- this man made your day- now better than ever."}
{"text":"Overrated at best. Staff are clumsy: we had to ask for empty plates to be removed and water glasses refilled. Bathrooms are a mess: lightbulbs out, stall doors broken. Booth seats are poorly made: if the person in the next booth leans back it pushes your seat too. And the pizza is just meh. Disappointing."}
{"text":"it's the best pizza I've ever eaten. Yes, it's a bit pricey, long waits, blah blah blah. Don't care. I love you."}
{"text":"bread + cheese + sauce *doesnt always* = pizza.  the sauce is ok, cheese is ok, but crust is the life of deep dish... and papa del's crust is really just dough.  I was starving, so I ate one slice and tossed the rest.  maybe it was a bad night... or maybe the rest of the reviewers were drunk on pbrs at the time of consumption (note Gumby's 4 star review).  personally i'd have been just as happy with a kraft macncheese.  the cheesy garlic bread delivers though.  it's bread, it's cheesy and it's definitely garlicy.  but $25 for delivery on a $2 loaf of garlic bread and a bland chewy dough pie covered in cheese and sauce doesn't fit my description of 4 stars .  this is my third shot at local pizza... may find myself at rosatis soon if I can't find a better pie.  god spede pizza fans.  ps no pineapple?  how hard would that be?"}
{"text":"If you own a jeep or SUV and want a mini off-road adventure within Champaign-Urbana, look no further than Papa Del's parking lot. Parents, be sure to watch your children very carefully when it's raining as there is no lifeguard on duty.  All kidding aside, their pizza is great. I usually go over the noon hour and pick up a slice of their sausage or mushroom pizza, as a whole pizza is way too much for a singleton like me.  Highly recommended if you haven't tried it."}
{"text":"Overrated. Big time.  To be fair, I do not like deep dish or Chicago style pizza. But I figured I would see if I had changed my mind. I haven't.  Wait is WAY too long, pizza is boring and you may as well eat bread with sauce and cheese on the side.   Will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Papa Dels was recommended by the front desk at my hotel. Was close to the hotel and delicious. Best pizza I've had in a while. We had the thin crust. We also ordered the breadsticks... I'm 6'3\" and they were as long as my forearm. The only negatives were they forgot one of my two sauces you get with the breadsticks, and it's not explained well that each topping will be $2 additional. The wording of the pizza made me think I could get however many toppings I would like for the price. Maybe just me, but definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever.  This place puts Chicago and New York pizza to shame.  That said, the service is slow and clumsy.  If you plan to eat in the restaurant, call your order in about 25 minutes before you arrive."}
{"text":"Although I am hopeful every time I see a Chicago pizza place, I am usually skeptical. This place looked perfect for what we were looking for... natural light, TV's, laid back, etc. We ordered breadsticks not knowing they are like 2 ft long! They were good but we couldn't make much of a dent.  The stuffed pizza was a small but it was almost as tall as it was wide. It looked good and we struggled to figure out a way to conquer it. Unfortunately, the dough didn't do it. It was the same dough that was used for the breadsticks but it felt like I was eating pizza on a giant piece of Wonder Bread! My crust needs a little more personality and pizzazz and without a solid crust, the pizza isn't worth much!"}
{"text":"Ever since I moved to Champaign 2 years ago I've heard how great Papa Del's was from just about everyone that I know. After all this time, 2 years later, I finally made my way over to try this legendary pizza.  First off, I love their new location. They recently consolidated their two locations into one in a rather perfect place for both students and residents of CU, right off of Neil Street. They did a complete renovation to make both the inside and outside modern and inviting.  The staff there were very friendly and checked in regularly. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and the classic Sicilian pizza with sausage and mushrooms. The stuffed mushrooms tasted fresh and did not disappoint. The pizza was absolutely huge, which was unexpected. You could taste that that is was handmade with fresh ingredients, and it's easily one of the best pizzas I've ever had. We ordered a medium for the two of us and still have a ton of leftovers.  The pizza definitely lived up to the hype and we will certainly be back to try other varieties. Great staff, great pizza. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Can't even get someone to the host stand to see if we can get seated. It's a Tuesday night, sure they're busy with the after Christmas crowd, but after waiting 10 minutes with no one, except for I'll be back with you in a minute, we left frustrated."}
{"text":"Okay!  First.  Go to the pictures side of this thing and look at the pies.  I mean, we're talking about crawling into a mounds of cheese, here, piled inside a fluffy, yet crunchy, yet bready, but firm crust, cradling us in a sauce that cannot (and I've tried!  Numerous times!) be replicated, with toppings that are big enough to knock down a running dog!  Who... in their right mind... could say no?  And why would you??!  It's amazing!  It defies words!  It's a $27 pizza and worth every penny!  But, as much as the pizza is a healthy 20 out of 5 stars (no joke!), there are some wicked negatives that come along with Papa Del's Pizza.    They are definitely unflinching when it comes to \"their rules\".  And they'll tell ya about it, too!  But, most of them that I've been privy to over the years have definitely fallen by the wayside in order to keep competitive with rival pizzerias.  For example, for the longest time they swore up and down that they would never deliver.  Any request for delivery was met with a rather harsh admonishment abt their restaurant being farrrrrr tooooo bussssy.  Don't get me wrong, they are that!  And it shows, too.  Their brick and mortar on Green is ALWAYS packed!  It's far too congested, and far too loud of an environment for me to consider an enjoyable experience.  We just grab our pizza and head back home!    I digress (take-out is wonderful, usually).  But, since, they've changed their stance on delivery. Franchising was another example.  That one still stands, though, some people consider the newer location (At The Crossing) to be one.  It's more of an extension of the actual restaurant for those who live on the southside of town.  That location has no in-restaurant dining, so be sure to come ready with plans to head somewhere else!  There was a time they guaranteed they'd never ship their product, too, but that's also changed!  And for the better!  Pack a bunch of pies into a to-go carton, a few bags of dry ice, and it's pizza time from your freezer to your stove!  Brilliant!  If you're local, grab a few frozen pies while you're out getting your to-go order, and you'll have pizza for that 2AM craving! :D  Parking can be an issue at both joints.  While The Crossing is new (and there's ample parking available), it might not be right next to the door ('specially with all the new food places out there)!  The Green St location suffers from a different problem!  It's like the parking you'd find at a county fair!  Potholes about hip deep filled with rain water, usually. =P  Just be careful and watch where you're going.  People have been known to lose their car in some of those puppies.  It's all pan-sexual baby goats, and children with their wardrobes down there!"}
{"text":"Love to order there pizza. We get  there pizza once a month never changes in taste i recommend it"}
{"text":"So let me start by saying that I have not yet actually had a meal at the new location. My husband and I went there to try to have lunch but left before being seated because we were going to a movie and though we gave ourselves ample time to eat there, we didnt want to risk being late. With that being said, I'm posting this as hopefully a helpful and constructive review for the establishment based on the reviews I've heard from other people. I'm also someone who worked in the restaurant biz for many years, so this is coming from someone with the mind of a server, not a patron.  I'll spare you my story but will say this:  I truly want this location to work. I think that under the right management and with the proper training, that this place could be a gold mine. However, I've heard nothing but very VERY poor reviews on the service, ESPECIALLY the management. This leads me to believe that Papa Del's got ahead of themselves and opened before they were properly ready. I feel that they committed to opening at the beginning of March and felt pressured to hold that promise. I dont know about everyone else, but personally, I'd rather have seen an article come out stating they were postponing the opening another few weeks to ensure proper training, rather than give the first impression that I'm seeing and hearing they're giving. This is turning so many people away from what is (or used to be) single handedly the best pizza in town. Secondly, they should've done a soft opening to help ensure the wait staff, management, and kitchen were all properly prepared. At this point, it almost seems like it'd be better for Papa Del's to close its doors for a few weeks, work on training and hiring proper staff, and then do another reopen.   Now- in the defense of the restaurant: People need to understand that this pizza takes FOREVER to cook. It's no secret and everyone knows that great things take time. This is also going to affect how quickly tables are turned over, meaning longer wait times. I think that it's great that they will let you place your order while you're waiting to help cut down on your wait time when you get to your table. However, I think that if this is not executed properly, this could cause some MAJOR problems. Everyone also needs to understand that this is a whole new approach and angle for this business. Yes, they've been around a long time. But they've never done things the way they're trying to do them now so give them a chance and some time to get it all figured out.  All in all- my husband and I are going to give them a month or so to get the kinks worked out and then will try to go again for lunch or dinner some day. If, by then, they dont have at least MOST of the issues fixed, then they're going to seriously jeopardize what could and should be one of the best restaurants and local businesses in town. I'm pulling for you Papa Del's so PLEASE figure out how to fix this so that we can enjoy your food and location for years to come!"}
{"text":"Having attended the University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign) as undergraduate and graduate student, Papa Del's pizza is a long-time favorite. While the location has changed to a much larger facility, it was really refreshing that the pizza remain exactly the same. I love it! Unfortunately, as the business grows so much larger that also came with problems related to wait times and service. We went around 7:00pm on a Saturday night and the wait-time was estimated at over an hour, which I was surprised about since the new space is so large. Ultimately, we grew tired of waiting and found an empty be table that needed cleaning. Eventually they cleaned the table and we sat. The waitress was pretty frazzled and said she was new, so of course we gave her a break. However we were super disappointed that she never came to retrieve any of the dishes from our table, so they simply collected and we had to stack them ourselves on the side. Overall, even with the wait and service problems - the pizza is still worth it...but I'd recommend you pick-up vs. dine-in."}
{"text":"Papa Del's has changed since I last ate here, which was about 25 years ago when the restaurant was on Green Street near campus.  The ingredients still taste pretty much the same -- the sauce, the homemade sausage, the high quality mozzarella.  And I must say the crust tastes like it has the same recipe as well -- but the crust to topping ratio is WAY off.  The whole crust was like a thick slab of bread.  25 years ago there was a thick outer rim of crust with thinner crust inside.  Similar to what you would see at Giordano's or any of the other typical Chicago style deep dish pizza joints.  And Papa Del's did it just as good or better than those favorites.  But at some point in the intervening years, someone in control decided that more bready pizza was better.  Not so.  The ratio for a satisfying and delicious pizza experience has definite boundary parameters, and Papa Del's now falls outside those parameters.  Way too bready.  Don't plan on coming back, which is a sad end to a decades long memory of a once fantastic pizza restaurant."}
{"text":"Solid food, solid service, long wait. If you know walking it'll take an hour when ordering the pizza, you will be fine. I like old school antipasto salads so this wasn't my cup of dressing but I will say the ingredients were fresh and higher end. I'd go again to watch a game and have a beer with some solid pie."}
{"text":"Born and raised in Chicago eating Chicago style pizza.  As a loyal Lou Malnatti patron, I can support Papa Del's stuffed pizza.  Takes 45-55 minutes which is just a fact that has to be accepted.  They have great sausage that they cook before making the pizza which provides a great carmalised crispy texture and taste that adds another layer of experience.  Had Papa Del's in college 20 years ago and went back with my daughter this week and it is the same.  Great to see it serving up the same great pie.  Lunch time they sell pre-made pizza by the slice.  Pan pizza with one topping but gets you quick pizza without the wait.  But the stuffed pizza is not offered.  If you like greesy pizza or are a thin pizza fan then Papa's isn't for you.  But don't rate it then.  Like rating an Sushi place down because you don't like raw fish."}
{"text":"Very tasty deep dish stuffed pizzas! They do take about an hour though so I would call ahead and do a carry out order. The price is a bit high as well at about $30-$40 for a large. Still I enjoyed the pepperoni and onions pizza we got."}
{"text":"One star-FOR THE PIZZA!!  I'd give the pizza four stars but that would be misleading as the overall experience was a BIG let down!! On a Monday afternoon we got there about six. Had to wait for a table-no problem with that. My bestie and I each ordered a margarita and that was the first stop on our tour Southward.  No tequila could be tasted and it was sugar water with a lime-SERIOUSLY!  My friend was a bartender many lives ago so she went to the bar to teach the bartender how to make one. He was not gracious about it and still followed her directions. She came back with a good Rita.  The second ones we ordered we had high hopes for and they were dashed flatter than a bug on a windshield.  These Rita's tasted like straight sour mix and were un drinkable.  Next stop Southward-we ordered a large Cesar salad to share. The joke was on us. They must have just waved the dressing over the lettuce leaves-the croutons were flavorless and no Parmesan cheese. $9 for lettuce.  Our waitress disappeared several times-the pizza took an hour and a half and by then cardboard would have been attractive-we have now hit bottom! Order to pick up if you must have pizza. Hopefully, the owner(s), manager(s) will read these reviews and will take them to heart. Other wise, Papa Del's will go the way of all bad trips-it will not be something you will want to do again."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely terrible. The pizza.... Well it's papa dells! My wife and I went in for lunch, we ordered salad garlic bread and two slices of pizza. Our pizza came out first followed by our salad, we thought they had forgot our garlic bread.... Nope after we were finished eating our server brought out the garlic bread along with our bill. If it wasn't for the pizza I would never come here again."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Papa Del's Pizza.  I heard a lot of good things and the food was very good.  I really liked the Sicilian style deep dish pizza.  Our waiter was really off his game and not very attentive to my wife and myself."}
{"text":"Papa Del's has good mushroom and sausage pizza  and good cheesey garlic beard and plus it is one of the best pizza places to go to in Champaign you should check it out. I will be returning to Papa Del's again."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is terrible. Takes forever for even the simplest order. And you have to practically trip your waiter for them to notice you need anything."}
{"text":"For full disclosure purposes, I worked at Del's in the early 'Nineties.  I stopped in a couple of weeks ago and was in heaven from the heady smell and the curiously identical everything else!   Pops is still making some of the best Deep Dish anywhere. The decor is dated, the pies take forever in that five-deck oven, and the service is a bit lackluster.   But the food is great old school pizzeria.   Get the Italian Salad as an appetizer. Proceed to the Sicilan Pan pizza (although the Stuffed and Thin are solid--just not as good).   Not fancy, brother.  Just tasty.   Still good cold the next day.  Bank on it."}
{"text":"The dismal service really brings this place down. The pizza is fine, but the service is just terrible. They've had long enough to work out the bugs, and now it's downright embarrassing. Deep dish pizza takes a long time to cook, so that isn't the issue. This issue is our server simply would not refill our water, check back in on us, or even bring the check! We eventually had to ask for a manager to get our check and a to-go box. We've been here four times since they opened in their new location, and every time we're disappointed. The joke is on us."}
{"text":"This place is famous for its pizza, but that isn't Chicago style pizza. All in all it's decent, just don't think you've had Chicago pizza if you've tried it here. Go to Giordano's or Lou Malnati's."}
{"text":"I have been eating Papa Del's since about 1975 and a friend and I ate one pie every night for three months so we could fill enough pizza cards to take our crew to dinner free. Since leaving Illinois I have made detours of many miles just for this pizza and to prove to others how good it is.. The best dinner ever and not a Chicago Style pizza, It's made with real dough, not buttery pie dough.."}
{"text":"worked here, ate here. many many times.  pizza is to die for. do not come during homecoming or mom/dads weekend, it will be packed.  and they ship frozen cross country!"}
{"text":"Simply the best deep dish, and has been since I had my first slice over 22 years ago.   Worth the 2 hour drive.   Go for the sausage and go extra sausage if you must"}
{"text":"What a nice recommendation from my niece. In Champaign for graduation/mother's day and decided to order take out. We assumed the place would be packed related to graduation weekend so we ordered it to go.   Patti at the carry out station was awesome. She was able to accommodate out of towners with forks and plates, repeated the order back to me and was even able to add on a garlic loaf to my order when I asked at time of pick up.   Onto the food...The loaf was totally worth the wait! I assume it would be even better as a cheesy garlic loaf. We ordered a thin crust pizza - my niece normally goes deep dish, but the rest of the group decided thin crust. It was delicious. Nice and crispy.  Overall, it was a party in my mouth! Thanks again Pat!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service EVER.  After waiting for 2 hours, we were told several times that  it should be just a few minutes.   They finally said they didn't have our pizzas.  Instead of making it right, they didn't offer us anything else and awkwardly stood there insisting we pay for our drinks .   We will NEVER set foot in this place again."}
{"text":"My 6yr old and I went here for lunch on a Friday afternoon.   It was crowded, but we were seated right away.   Time: 1215pm.    We sat down and after 7 minutes, our order was taken.  We ordered the lunch time slices. It took 10 minutes for our drink order to get to the table.  I ordered water and my son asked for juice -- his options were either cranberry juice or grapefruit juice.  My son ordered grapefruit juice (?!?!).   He took one sip and declared that it was the most disgusting drink he's ever had.  We started playing chess on my phone and after another 25 minutes, our slices came..... they were on the cold side of room temperature.   Rather than sending them back, at the risk of having to wait another 25 minutes, we just ate them .  My son didn't mind, because I'd rather not have that roof of his mouth being burned by scalding hot cheese.   I would've rather had my pizza hot.    We finish our pizza and had to wait for another 15 minutes to flag our inattentive waitress down.... she brought us the check, then disappeared again.   Another 10 minutes go by, and she runs our credit card through..... then she hovers over me, impatiently, while I sign the receipt.   $1.00 tip.   Thank you not so much..... don't think I'll return.    We walked out of there around 1:20......   Normally, I don't tolerate this kind of service, but I didn't want to spoil my son's pizza lunch...... Don't come here if you are on a lunch hour, because it'll take you a lot longer than that to eat a slice of pizza."}
{"text":"We had a stellar server today, Lashanda, even tho it was her first day this lady got the answers to my questions - and those answers were correct.  Our service was organized, professional,  friendly and timely.    We ordered the pizza 30min ahead of our arrival. My companion said it was as great as it was 46 years ago.  I'm a newbie and not big on the heavy carbs these days.  That can make dining out challenging - but NOT at Papa Del's.    I had the large Italian Salad which is made with field greens - not a shred of iceberg - I was thrilled , besides it was made with quality sliced cheese, pepperoni, green & black olives, mild onion, peproncinis.on a lovely square plate.  Fantastic.    I also had the stuffed mushrooms - stuffed with herbed goat cheese and served hot.   These were perfect with the salad.  I did taste the Sicilian pizza with sausage pepperoni and green Bells - it was yummy.    Once again you can taste the difference from other pizzas because the ingredients are of a superior quality.  Not greasy or salty.  The red sauce tastes like tomatoe, not sweetened.    The restaurant has a full bar and tons of large TVs."}
{"text":"I have eaten at over a dozen deep dish pizza restaurants around the country, including some of the most famous in Chicago (Lou's, Uno, Giordano's, etc) and still Papa Del's is the best.  Be ready to wait for your pie, it takes a solid 45 minutes to bake this pizza.  But it is worth every minute!  They do delivery, take out, and dine in at this location.  The other location is only pickup and delivery.  Wait staff is friendly, quick, and proficient, some of them have been there for years.  Make sure you get the Sicilian style, if you get thin you're doing it wrong."}
{"text":"Best pizza in champaign/urbana hands down.  No one else is even close to Papa Del's pan pizza.  I get a pie with sausage and mushrooms and i can't ask for much more in my pizza, for some strange reason, i find the pizza is even better warmed up the next day as a leftover than it is freshly served.  Want to try some sandwiches as well, but have a hard time getting past the pizza."}
{"text":"Best Chicago-style pizza in town!!!!!  If you are in town you should go here!!!!   The pizza is just amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"We order Papa Del's almost every Friday night!  I have never been disappointed!  However, we have always ordered for take-out, and never eaten in the restaurant.  I think the Sicilian pan pizza takes 45 minutes to an hour, and that is just too long to sit in a restaurant waiting.  The thin crust pizzas take considerably less time.  So, I recommend getting this for carry-out, and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The worst service i have ever had. I came back home to visit my friends and family. I work at a michelin star restaurant in Chicago so i know what great service is. Unfortunately, I could of gotten better service at McDonald's. Our waitress, which I'm sure had no serving experience took our order, i got a slice of the special, an order of breadsticks, we decided to split a pitcher of beer.   First, the woman told me they ran out of breadsticks. Really? It was about 12:35 in the afternoon, how do you run out on your opening weekend? So we instead we got garlic dough balls.  They were okay but lacked salt.   Second, the waitress comes back to the table and tells is they do not have Bud light pitchers?  What? I was just by the bar and i saw them pouring Bud light. My other friend who is a waitress asked if they had bottles, she said no. Are you kidding me? Another waiter i just saw bring the group next to us bottles of bud light. Not to mention, we didn't even get our beers until after our food was brought out. Had to flag down waitress just to get a water refill. Pathetic excuse for sevice.  Third, when my food came out it was cold. I couldn't believe it, shitty service and cold food at a restaurant that has been in the pizza business for years, literally shocked at how bad it was. Poor management and inexperienced staff will definitely run this place to the ground.  Overall, save your time and money and go anywhere but here. I will not be recommending this place to anyone. It's too bad too because i have tons of family and friends who come visit Champaign for leisure and business."}
{"text":"Best pizza in chambana.  It isn't really for a college life though as it takes a while to make the pizza and its not cheap.  I recommend the pan as its a more healthy version of the deep dish (or at least I tell myself that)."}
{"text":"Having not eaten at Papa Del's since around 1975, I can't judge the current food and service. But I can tell you that 35 years ago the pizza then was the best and the service the worst. So I guess some things never change. . . ."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Urbana-Champaign. Love it! You can't get anything as good as this pizza anywhere else. The deep dish is a must."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Chicago!!  We devoured our sausage and pepperoni pizza tonight.  Yum! Wish we had these in LA!"}
{"text":"Zomg, I must rave about this place. Normally, I hate the crust of any pizza, but Papa Del's crust is soft and absolutely to die for. Every bite was completely orgasmic. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh I want more!"}
{"text":"I don't give a lot of two star reviews, and I find rant reviews frustrating. For that reason, I'll try to give my thought out reason for the two star review. In short, it was for the experience. The food was actually pretty good. I'm from the Chicago area, and I think this place does a comparable job with Chicago style deep dish pizza, a few hours south of the real deal.   So the story is, I was coming here with 16 people. If you were going with fewer, I think you'd be fine. I think.   We called ahead. We were told we couldn't make a reservation unless we put in an order on the phone. We didn't do that, and when we got there the back dining room (not the front area because of a basketball game) was empty. The basketball game could be why the place was out of sorts with their service. Anyway, the staff at the front seemed to be aware of our phone call and, though seemingly difficult, they were able to put together some tables for us. The waiter was nice enough and took our drink orders and understood when we explained how many of us would be on separate checks (needing to get reimbursements) at the end of the meal.  Since some people ordered the deep dish pizza that knowingly takes a long time to cook, we got cheesy garlic bread at my table to share, and it was so good. A pair in our group also ordered some and never got it. When they asked and the waiter said he would put it in, we were already nearly done with ours and pizza was coming shortly. They canceled that. For the entree, I got the lasagna because it was the Thursday special. It was a very generous portion that came with bread and salad. Though a good deal, the lasagna flavor wasn't anything to write home about, in fact, a bit too salty in my mind. The ricotta inside had nice herbs. Now, the pizza, is another story. I'll share a picture I took of the everything but the kitchen sink pizza a friend got. I was impressed. The issue was the timing. The four of us eating on my end of the table were nearly done before some in the middle and on the other end got their food.  I know we were a large group, but the timing was very off. Several groups (a couple and a group of 3, I think) came in, ate, and left in the time we waited for our food. The waiter and kitchen seemed to need extra help. Another group of people we knew came in about a half hour after us and were told the place was out of deep dish. They only had one more lasagna. With 16 people, we cleared the Papa Del's kitchen. If you're going to try your luck with Papa Del's, I say get it for take out or go with a smaller group."}
{"text":"Compared to Gino's East in downtown Chicago, this place gets 4 stars. Compared to everywhere else that sells deep dish pizza, this place is easily 5 stars.  The deep dish is done right at Papa Del's.  Lot's of tasty toppings, cheese, and sauce piled on top of the crispy crust.  Don't let other \"deep dish\" joints fool you.  It's not just a thick slab of dough.  If done well, the dough is relatively thin because all the fillings are held inside.  I have a friend who brings home 2 Papa Del's pizzas back to St. Louis to his parents every time he goes home because they went to Illinois back in the day, and they just can't stop eating it.  That's quality!"}
{"text":"This is the most greasy food you will find in Champaign, and the slowest preparation for it. First, I was seated and waited about 15 minutes for a server to come get my drink order. Second, the \"breadsticks\", or grease covered stale bread, took about 30 minutes to come to the table along with the drink I had ordered. I also ordered a salad, that took forever, and was very sad looking with a few slices of cheese that looked like it came straight from Walmart. The pizza, being a thin crust, took a whopping 50 minutes to come out of the kitchen after about 3 times of me asking and no response. The pizza was OKAY, but again, CAKED IN GREASE. And the veggie unwitch was very laughable. It too took about 50 minutes to prepare (CRAZY). And it was just a leaf caked with really gross and fatty pesto with a few tomatoes. Very disappointed. 2 hours wasted of my life and a CRAZY bill."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in the whole wide world.   I wish they would ship via FedEx -- I live in California but every time I am in C-U I make a bee-line for Papa Dels."}
{"text":"I really don't like deep dish pizza, but I LOVE the deep dish at Papa Del's!! It's so good and so worth the wait to get it. Unfortunately we didn't discover it until my senior year while at UIUC. I miss it so much. If you live in the area you need to go try it."}
{"text":"Easily the best pizza I have ever had. If there is a better pizza in CU I'd love to know where to find it. So far nothing comes close. Excellent!"}
{"text":"What happened to Papa Del's??? We waited an hour for 2 thin pizzas and they came out cold. Service was slow and the manager didn't handle this situation appropriately, placing the blame on the server. And why did you change your sausage recipe? What used to be amazing is now gross. You shouldn't have messed with the original."}
{"text":"This is  one of the best pizza's around - Even rival's Chicago's famous pizzas.   The staff was friendly. We hung around in the bar after and the bartenders were friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Among my favorite memories from my days as a student at Illinois would have to be when a professor saw me working on a project late one night in the lab and said \"oh Hi Michael, we have some leftover pizza, want some?\" And the leftover pizza turned out to be half a deep dish pizza from Papa Dels. That I devoured completely on my own. Oh sweet free deliciousness.  Everybody has their own opinions about the best pizza in Chambanavoy. Unfortunately, many of them are wrong. Papa Dels is the best. Half a medium cheese deep dish is enough to kick my fat butt. However, it does take forever and it is fairly spendy.  Eating in is not always awesome. Being that it takes them 45+ minutes to cook a pizza, you'll see a lot of people sitting around waiting for their pizza (since some people are silly enough not to call in their order ahead of time). This means that it can sometimes be tricky to get seated - due to all the people waiting (AKA Papa Del's noobs). Service ranges from mediocre to OK.  Bathrooms are clean and they have toilet paper that is a step or two above  the stadium grade/industrial sandpaper variety.  Overall, I can't imagine Chambanavoy without Papa Del's. It is awesome. I wish it were cheaper and faster, but I also wish that I had Super Man's abilities. Can't have everything you want in life, you know? I guess I'm just going to have to drown my sorrows in another delicious Papa Del's pizza. Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Real food. Don't go if you are in hurry, but the wait is worth it.  The staff seemed to know the menu and all its options.  I would choose this over any pizza place in C-U!!"}
{"text":"Papa Del's has been one of my favorite dining establishments in Champaign (and THE best pizza) since I first tried it as a college freshman 34 years ago.  Del's is most well known and well loved for its pan (thick) pizza. Though it is thick and cooked in a pan, I don't really consider this to be a Chicago deep dish pie, but I consider Del's pan pizza to be a style of its own. Though the pan pizza is good, I feel it is overrated by most patrons as it has a disproportionately high ratio of dough to toppings.  My preference therefore is Del's thin, which I think is the unsung hero of the Papa Del's menu. Their thin pizza has a crust roughly 1/4 inch thick, which comes out from the oven crispy on the bottom and softened by the ingredients on top. To me, the thin pizza's proportion of dough to sauce, cheese, and other toppings is just about perfect.  Normal cooking time for a thin is 30 minutes and for a thick (pan) is 45 minutes. Adjust  these numbers upward if you are dining at a busy time, particularly on Illini home football game weekends.  Del's serves excellent garlic bread which will tide you over between the time you sit down and the time your pizza is served.   Service and the overall dining experience at Papa Del's can be spotty at times. The main dining room is a building whose tall ceilings and walls turns it into a bit of an echo chamber; the space would be improved by wall treatment that would deaden the sound. Groups of patrons are sometimes doubled up at the long tables with other groups of patrons, even when there's plenty of vacant dining space available, and the college-aged wait staff can be hard to flag down at times, though at other times they are attentive and responsive.  For those reasons I order for pick-up (Papa Del's also offers delivery) more often than not. In any event, my fondness for Papa Del's is not about the service and dining experience; it's all about the pizza."}
{"text":"When you eat pizza at a restaurant this should never be your thought, \"Frozen pizza is better\". We ordered the thin crust and it was awful. No one even wanted to take it home. Yikes! If you want poor crust, tons of marinara style sauce you might like it. Service was great but no need to ever go back."}
{"text":"Got the medium stuffed pizza. Too much for two people. Good sauce. Good cheese. Could have been hotter. We waited over an hour. It was good but a little doughy.  Z's pizza in CA stuffs with tomatoes and scored higher."}
{"text":"Everything but the kitchen sink chicago deep dish pizza is where it's at. I recommend this place to anyone in the aera looking for a amazing pie. I think I might just eat there again tonight. Yep it's that good"}
{"text":"I visited Champaign, IL, recently for a quick weekend stay, and this restaurant was always the first suggestion made when I asked, \"where should we go for lunch.\" It wasn't crowded at lunch time so my girlfriends and I could sit and relax. We ordered their specialty deep dish pizza. It. was. huge. We ordered  a large and I think each one of the four of us at one piece. It was good but next time I will try the thin crust. If you are looking for an appetizer - try the meatballs. They were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Hmmm....not what i remembered about papa dels.  We went the Thursday after opening late so lines were not an issue and then again the Sunday after opening but only for drinks the second time. The salad was remarkably a step up unless you are old school iceberg in those old wooded bowls. On Thursday they were out of our fist two drink choices, no problem understand opening week. The biggest disappointment was the pizza itself. Really an almost empty resaurant at 1000pm, pizza was served warm, not hot, and the dough/crust just didnt have that old papa dels excellence I remebered. Then came the Sunday visit, the bar tendender didnt even know what beer was in what tap and again out of our first choice. I will end with the worst part of both nights and the reason for 2 stars, the men's bathroom. I will be vague not specific promise. The trash looked like it hadn't been emptied sice opening night overflowing and all over the floor. Then the smell kicked in as i made my way around the pile on the floor only to discover more 'piles' that were the source of the aroma. Paper and liquids all over the toilet and floor + the stench = me waiting til i got home, luckily i could wait. Had the bathroom been in order three stars would have been given as the pizza/availability of drinks left a lot to be desired. Will give it another shot in about a month."}
{"text":"My brothers and I showed up in town for a Big 10 tournament from Chicago - so we relied on yelp to help us find a decent pizza restaurant in the area.  Papa Del's listed great reviews for deep dish pizza - but we had just had our favorite in Chicago the night before so were actually looking for hand tossed or thin. Thanks to yelp, we ended up here. We called ahead for carry out rather than trying to figure out if they could deliver to our hotel.  The pizza was perfect and the italian salad was too big to finish.  The sausage on the pizza we ordered were like mini meatballs - almost too big for one bite. Everyone who works there is obviously a college student but very nice and helpful.  The restaurant has a weird layout and was typical dirty bar/college with crumbs, straw wrappers, napkins on the floor...so get your food to go if this would bother you."}
{"text":"During a recent trip to Champaign, I decided to stop by this well rated deep dish pizza spot.  Papa Del's is the real thing, and it is really good.  The sausage is as good as everyone says and the deep dish is the perfect thickness (i.e. crisp crust, soft chewy crust with a thin layer of dough topped by cream thick cheese).  I also tried the large meatballs and marinara sauce (which is something I picked up after living out east) and it was awesome.   The meatballs were super flavorful and the sauce had the perfect sweetness.  If you're in the Champaign area, Papa Del's should be a definite stop on your Campus tour."}
{"text":"The pizza is great. The only problem is the wait for the pizza. I would recommend calling in your order ahead of time so that when you are hungry you can eat immediately. Overall great visit."}
{"text":"This is the best deep dish pizza in Champaign! Service is fair, but the food makes up for it! It is usually crowded during prime dinner times and big weekends in Champaign, so make sure to plan ahead and call your pizzas in ahead of time. Their delivery is not very reliable, so I suggest carrying out if you are not up for dining in."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and ordered a salad with Italian dressing. First off, the salad was said to contain mixed greens... When it arrived, it was iceberg with two tomato slices on top. The worse part was that the \"Italian\" dressing was simply olive oil with Italian herb seasoning sprinkled on top. Worse salad and service ever!! Completely disappointed in what I thought was a nice place for local pizza."}
{"text":"First, let's correct a slight misconception.  This is not exactly Chicago-style pizza.  Although it may not seem possible to those whose conception of pizza centers on the east coast or California styles, Papa Del's thick crust is noticeably doughier, thicker, heavier, and more casserole-like than anything being served at a classic Chicago-style pizza place.  Our of respect for pizza aficionados, I have to note that there's a slight difference in kind, not degree, between what Giordano's serves and what Papa Del's serves.  But second, it's still fantastic pizza.  It may seem pricey, but an 8-piece thick crust pizza can easily serve 4-6 because the slices are so filling and thick (it can feed 7 if you're like me and always have 6 sorority girls on diets hanging out with you).  The tomato sauce is delicious and perfectly-spiced and with the doughy crust it forms almost a focaccia taste (like a real focaccia taste and not what you get at Friday's).  The meat toppings are the best (bacon, pepperoni, and sausage are all great).  I would advise against getting onions, as they can overpower the rest of the pizza, but it's still very, very good thick-crust pizza and it's well worth the lengthy wait.  It's not a 5-star because the dine-in service/experience is poor.  I strongly, strongly recommend getting take-out.  Also note the calender; if it's an Illinois home football or basketball game, call 60-90 minutes in advance and do not try to eat-in.  And the thin crust is lousy."}
{"text":"Gosh, I hate to be a buzz kill, but this pizza is just plain thick.  There's practically no flavor.  I don't think it's just a Chicago thing.  But it's a UIUC institution and I do enjoy going, but I usually have one of the entrees instead of pizza - that's why it gets the high three-star rating.  However, cold, the next day, a slice of Del's makes for a decent lunch - I don't know what it is, it just tastes better to me that way."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza you can get in CU. Pizza can take quite a while to cook, so be prepared to wait (but it's totally worth it).  Most of my experience with Papa Del's Pizza is actually through info sessions held by companies on campus - the promise of a hearty slice of Papa Del's is enough to lure many into the room. Just one slice is a filling meal. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch based on other positive Yelp reviews with great expectations. Left with those expectations being met.  My wife and I split a delicious salad, garlic bread with cheese and some marinara for dipping. What I LOVED was I we could order the deep dish pizza (which takes 45 minutes for a whole pie) by the slice. Two pieces of pepperoni coming right up!!! The pizza was, of course, fabulous and hit the spot.   I saw on a couple other reviews negative comments about the staff being disorganized. Our waitress was on her game and handled multiple diners flawlessly! I told her it was out first time dining there and she made her recommendations with confidence. The rest of the staff seemed excellent as well.    I can see why this is a top pizza place in Champaign/Urbana"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. A good idea to call your order in ahead of time as the pies take a long time to bake. Totally worth the wait! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I don't like deep dish pizza and if given the option I will always go for a New York slice. Inb4 \"you're not a real Chicagoan.\" Well, that's true... Anyway, Papa Del's has really grown on me. I think it might just be good enough to make me a weekend-convert."}
{"text":"deep dish pizza done right.  close enough to chicago to get the real thing."}
{"text":"Appalling service.  The pizza is good but the folks who work the bar lack basic bar etiquette.  Was waited on by Blaine last night.  Two pints of beer and no cocktail napkins or coasters.  Had to request cocktail napkins.  He sets the napkin down but doesn't place my beer on it.  For someone who lives on tips, pretty sad.  The bar was wet and hadn't been wiped down since whoever had sat there earlier. There was no one else besides the bearded regular and a couple of servers sitting at the bar and drinking, and I'm not entirely sure why the bar had not been wiped down."}
{"text":"Decent pizza and beer if you are starving. Dirty restaurant. Needs some cleaning and decor for what this is. 2 blocks from stadium needs more decor.   Poor service and ugly interior. It could be so much more given the beauty of building and location. The dirty dishes stacking by the bar is ridiculous. Why do the dishes at the bar?"}
{"text":"The breadsticks are very good. The marinara sauce lacked seasoning. The cheese sauce was not good. The service took forever. It took 55 mins to get our breadsticks. It took 20 mins to get drinks. We had to ask for refills which took another 20 mins. The waiter did not communicate well and wasn't friendly at all. He did say that they only had 1 bartender and 1 cook. The restaurant was half full.  Papa Del's is an icon in the community and we would love to come back and support this hometown small business but the service was terrible and I honestly don't have 2.5 hrs to wait on a small pizza and 5 breadsticks."}
{"text":"Their Chicago-style deep dish is amazing."}
{"text":"In moments of weakness, we will order Papa Del's to go and it's worth it every time.  The deep dish crust is thick but not greasy, which makes it perfect for scooping up the marina sauce in the pizza.  The pizza toppings are very generous and high quality.  The downside, of course, is that one must wait for a very long time if they want a deep dish.  Fortunately, the thin crust pizza is also good but not very memorable."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good and definitely thick crust. This means a one inch crust ON THE BOTTOM. Salads are typical and I think, iceberg. Delivery area is limited. Oh and if you should happen to need silverware with your take out (because you know, they don't deliver to you 1.5 miles away) be aware they will charge you $.10/piece. It's plastic but rest assured, I'll save it.   Meh. Hopefully I caught them at the end of the night on winter break."}
{"text":"WoW!  I never had pizza like this before...  I think I found my ultimate favorite Chicago-style pizza!  I mean we got the \"superstuffed\" and it was EXACTLY that: superstuffed with cheese, sauce, pepperoni, and crust! LoL.  No wonder Clinton came here before he was hospitalized! LoL.  I mean, I still prefer the New York THIN crust pizza, but if I ever opted for Chicago-style, I know where to get it in Champaign! ;)"}
{"text":"Papa Del's is great pizza. Simple. It's a little expensive to eat all the time, but a lot of fun for groups or when family comes to visit.  It also reheats very well, so don't be afraid to order a little extra."}
{"text":"i had heard about this place for the last couple yrs from my brother and my cowkrs who are UI alum.  i had heard that the pizza is even better than some places in chicago.  those are some big shoes to fill.  of course, since i was coming out for my brother's graduation, and i love pizza, this was the first place i wanted to go when i arrived at champaign.  for graduation wknd, this place was going to be packed, of course, so we ordered pizza for pickup on friday night.  we called at 6:10 and was told that it was going to be an hour and a half...wow!  we went to pick it up around 730.  around that time, a huge thunderstorm came and it also started hailing.  we ran into the restaurant, waited a few minutes for our pizza, grabbed it, and ran out into the pouring rain and hail to the car.  on our drive back, the roads started flooding (what is this weird place???), and it took a while to get home, as many cars were stuck in the flood.  we finally made it, and the pizza was delicious.  we got the super stuffed w/ sausage, spinach, and mushrooms.  the large was gigantic, and i only had 1 slice and was full.  the pizza would have been better if we ate at the restaurant, straight out of the oven, but it was still good.  we were going to re-bake it again to crisp it up, but after our wild ride back, we decided to eat it right out of the box.   the best way to reheat a slice is to put it straight on a frying pan after heating it in the oven a bit."}
{"text":"We were in town and decided to give the new location a try. The new restaurant is absolutely beautiful. It is too bad that the service did not match the beauty of the location. Our server must not have liked her job much today. She told my party at least five times in the hour we waited --- without receiving the pizza we ordered how everything was not her fault or her job. It is beyond me how we sat with empty beverages as she walked by numerous times. That must not have been her job. We ate a salad that had straight olive oil instead of a viniagrette. Did she check to see how we liked the salad...nope. Apparently, that wasn't her job either. We finally asked for refills after about 45 minutes. I also asked if she could clear that salad that we had been done with for about 30 minutes. This wasn't her job either ... she told me she would have a busser grab the plates. She returned with our refills and told us that our pizza had just come up and she would be right back. Awesome time to eat...not so fast. She dropped three plates and a stuffed pizza at the table. Clearly the pizza was not right...again checking that the pizza she brought to the table must not have been her job either. I think I finally figured out that her job was to chase customers from the restaurant. She was a champ at that. Cannot say I will be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Waited way too long for pizzas. Staff was not accommodating due to length of wait. Took 2 hours for thin crust pizza and 40 minutes to get a salad. We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Solid pizza.  No specialty pizzas, which stinks.  They go a little nuts with the cheese.  Double stuffed pizzas are enormous!"}
{"text":"If you want to be surrounded by television screens come here. There is not even a corner where you can hide.  It is dystopian...they had a room with 360 degrees of tvs...ridiculous.  As for the pizza...nothing better than Giordano, certainly not some legendary flavor.  If you want to bring your family for a sit down dinner of pizza with no electronic distractions...yes, this is still possible...this is definitely not the place.  I would not complain so much if the owners had not wasted thousands in dollars of renovations to plaster a tv everywhere...I mean everywhere."}
{"text":"I came here based on a recommendation of a friend who'd spent his undergraduate years at U of I many years ago.  I'm just in town for a couple of nights so I wanted to make sure I got some quality deep dish or pan pizza while I'm out here.  At lunch they offer their pan pizza by the slice and at a reasonable price.  The slice I had was covered in a beautiful mess of melted cheese, sauce, and thick chunks of delicious sausage.  The dough was thick and chewy-soft from the front all the way to the crust which had a really great crispness.  It was filling and just what I'd hoped it would be.  I paired that with a small Caesar salad and the bill came out to less than $8."}
{"text":"I went to grad school at UIUC in the late '70s, left for a job on the east coast in 1980, and haven't been back since.  In the intervening 30 years I've eaten close to 1000 pizzas by my reckoning, all over the country but mostly in the metro NYC area -- and NYC has some pretty good pizza.  But in that vast landscape of tomato pies, the only one that really stands out -- by which I mean the only one I sometimes crave with particularity; the only one I can vividly recall the appearance, aroma, and flavor of; and the only one that moves me with nostalgia -- is Papa Del's deep-dish sausage pizza.   It's a typical Chicago-style pie, baked in a heavily oiled, round, black steel pan. The crust is thick, bready, and slightly sweet. It doesn't just line the bottom, but extends up the side of the pan to contain the filling like a tart shell. This makes for a very high crust-to-filling ratio. The cheese -- at least a half-pound of a mozzarella blend in a \"small\" pie -- goes on the bottom, to prevent the crust from becoming soggy I guess. The sausage -- another half-pound, highly seasoned with fennel and garlic -- goes on next. It's raw when they put it in the oven, so all the fat oozes out as it bakes, mixing with the crushed tomatoes that cover the pie on top to form a delicious, meaty tasting sauce. I forget whether additions like mushrooms or onions go on top of or underneath the tomatoes -- underneath I think.  But one doesn't really care about the vegetables -- it's all about the cheese, the sausage, and the tomatoes. Best ... pizza ... ever! (as Comic Book Guy would say). Oh, and the lasagna dinner (with meat sauce) isn't bad either, if you're not in the mood for pizza."}
{"text":"From the beginning the experience here at Papa Del's, could maximally receive 4 stars, if the food was amazing.  The staff seems to be extremely disorganized. I understand that it is busy but no one approached us to seat us, so we had to do so ourselves and after seating us no one took our order. We had to approach a waitress standing off to the side just staring off into space. Overall this staff seems really disinterested. The pizza is pretty decent. Probably the closest you'll get to real Chicago style deep dish. However, the service really brought this one down."}
{"text":"Deep dish is pretty good. It reminds me of a Chicago deep dish type experience. I do like the thin crust as well. The place is always busy and noisy but worth the effort for the pizza."}
{"text":"I could almost eat this pizza everyday. I have yet to have a bad pizza here! It's your typical pizza joint, College aged servers and wooded chairs and tables. Can be loud but you will forget all that when you try the pizza! Now, I want pizza ;)"}
{"text":"I had to come up to C-Urb alot for work for a year, but I loved this place, made sure to come here once or twice each visit.  The pizza was so freaking great, and it had cheap beer...  Yum!"}
{"text":"The good: The deep dish pizza is great. The stuffed mushrooms are great. They have pizza-by-the-slice for lunch, which is quick and good value.  Keep in mind: The deep dish pizzas (except the lunch slices) take ~45 mins to bake, so it's best to go here when you have plenty of time.  The bad: The service varies a lot between \"okay\" and \"very confused\", particularly with groups that are splitting the check."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a better rating!  I've heard amazing things about it, so maybe that raised my expectations.  I went with a few friends and they called in our deep-dish half cheese, half green pepper and mushroom pizza about an hour ahead of time and it wasn't even ready when we got there.  The waitress kept forgetting about us, it seemed, and the place was packed and not well-staffed enough for the amount of people here.  Well, you guys know how I feel about customer service, so that would bring it down at least 1.5, if not 2, stars.  The thing is, their pizza was awful!  There was too much dough and not enough cheese; the sauce was a bit under-spiced in my opinion, and the vegetables on my half of the pizza were sparse and didn't taste fresh.  I came in starving and didn't even eat a whole piece of pizza.  I do remember, however, coming here years ago and really enjoying the thin crust pizza.  I saw some other people with it and it looked and smelled a lot better than mine, too, leading to my decision to give Papa Del's two stars instead of one.  Also, the bathrooms were clean.  That's about all I have to say."}
{"text":"Bad pizza, average service, not a place that I would visit again.  I order the so-called \"Stuffed Pizza\". In Chicago, stuffed pizza usually has a lot of cheese with only a little bit of crust. This pizza was totally the opposite, with hardly any cheese and a crust as thick as a loaf of bread. The crust also had a bread texture with no flavor whatsoever. I noticed a number of tables around leaving nearly half of their crust before they moved onto the next slice. When you have to leave that much crust behind, something is wrong. Also, there was hardly any sauce on the pizza, and the sauce was burnt as well. Another thing they did was add A LOT of oregano on top. If it was a good pizza, it should be able to stand alone without any help. The addition of this oregano makes me wonder if the restaurant isn't confident in their pizza. While I kindly asked for the rest of my pizza to be put in a to-go bad, I threw it away in a garbage can near my car, as I knew I would never finish it at home.  I also ordered garlic bread with cheese. The bread was hardly toasted, and the cheese peeled right off. Again, very disappointing.  I was thinking that this would be a good alternative to Chicago-style stuffed pizza. But what I had tonight wasn't anything like Chicago-style. Basically a loaf of bread with mediocre sausage and burnt sauce."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I think their pizza has too much bread/crust but lots of people love it if that's what you're into. New location on Neil is really nice."}
{"text":"Good deep-dish pizza, but the beer tends to be pretty skunky. Maybe we're just there on bottom-of-the-keg nights, but it's unpleasant to try to wash down delicious cheesy goodness with flat beer that tastes like greasy plastic tubing."}
{"text":"What a train wreck. Hostess was incompetent, and at one point just walked off in frustration. Literally said \"I can't handle this,\" and walked off.  She left a group of eight servers in her wake. Why eight servers were gathered around the hostess, God only knows. Can any of them \"handle this\"?    Alas, no...  The server was... Interesting.  I have never seen pitchers of soda served along with a separate pitcher of ice. That seemed weird, but turned out to be the best thought out part of the meal.   We were warned about the wait time for the meal, so that was nice. You're ordering deep dish pizza, and a wait is not altogether surprising. What is surprising is that when we got our pizzas, the temperature was uneven. Uneven, and no part was hot, at least as that term is commonly defined. Lukewarm?  That's being too generous. It varied from room temperature to tepid. Disappointing, especially at that price point. The reason given was that the cooks aren't leaving the pizzas in the oven long enough. Skimping on quality to deliver more quantity is a recipe for disaster. I won't be ordering from them any time soon.   I hope they are just working out the kinks because they have a lot of overhead to cover. It's a really nice looking place. But if they don't get their shit together, then I don't know how they will survive.  I certainly won't be back any time soon.   They really need competent staff. Get rid of the clueless high schoolers and hire some people who know what they are doing. The place was chock full of young employees just milling about, some with a dead look in their eyes like they were just dropped onto Omaha Beach and are totally shell-shocked.   Oh, and the bathrooms were atrocious. For a new restaurant, that is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Worst service and poorest management I have ever experienced. I ordered for take out at 4:25 and was told to come in at 5:45. When I came in at 5:45 and I noticed one of my pizzas was done on time. After a 45 minute wait, the other pizza was finally done, but it was made wrong. To make it worse, at 6:30, when the other pizza was finally done, the Manager offered me 1/2 half off the wrong pizza, but said nothing about the pizza that had been sitting in the warming by drawer for at least 45 minutes when I asked. I Told her no thanks, asked for a refund and left to Jet's got my pizza in 15 minutes. Everything correct and $10 cheaper. What a joke, I would have given 1/2 star if I could have."}
{"text":"We stopped by Papa Del's to order pizza, but ended up opting for pasta instead since we didn't have the 40-60 minutes needed for it to bake. Pizza by the slice is not available after 3 (and we were there a little after on a Saturday). We were okay with that, but did not end up having a good visit.  First, the service. We had not been to the new location. There were lots of employees behind the carryout counter and a couple servers in the restaurant space. We decided it must be a \"seat yourself\" situation, so we sat down. When we'd sat for some time while servers walked around us without greeting us or taking our order, I got up and asked someone in the front area if we needed to notify someone that we'd taken a table. The young man at the entrance stand said yes, he was supposed to seat us. Now, my husband had seen him earlier in the restaurant area near our table. He was sitting in a chair pulled up to a booth with customers in it, chatting away -- he had been there and not up front when we walked in. From his chair in the restaurant area, he had watched us come in and seat ourselves. But when I asked him whether we could remain there, he said, no, there were no servers assigned to that table. He asked us to move to another room in the restaurant, which we did.  Second, the food. We had an okay server (disorganized but well-intentioned) at our table for three, so things were looking up. We ordered mozzarella sticks, 2 salads (Italian for an up-charge and American) and fries as our sides, and 3 orders of pasta with meat sauce and meatballs with garlic bread (for an up-charge).   The mozzarella sticks are probably from a frozen bag of sticks, but they tasted good enough (by the time we got them, they'd cooled too much -- they weren't gooey any longer, unfortunately). The marinara with them was tasty. The salads and their dressings were fresh and delicious. They were generous in size, too.  The garlic bread was decent (although soggy because of the pasta water -- see below). The bread was fairly low quality, but it was crisped and the garlic butter on it was plentiful and tasty. The fries (our third side dish) never arrived.   The Pasta -- Not Recommended  The pasta was bad. Very bad. As the server carried plates of pasta toward us, there was so much water on the plates that it was slopping onto the floor. Some of it went down her front. She was apologizing and trying to level the plates so they wouldn't slop reddish water onto the table. She thought the water was coming from the meat sauce. It wasn't. It was clear to any good home cook that the pasta (the spaghetti and mostaccioli) had not been drained nearly enough.   The garlic bread (which, again, we'd paid extra for) was sitting in a pool of water on each plate, soaking it up. I immediately saved my bread by taking it off the plate and began soaking up the water with a napkin. It took two big napkins to soak most of the pasta water up on my plate alone.   We'd asked for the noodles to be cooked el dente. They were almost all the way soft -- not chewy at all. If the pasta had been cooked even a minute longer, I wouldn't have been able to eat it (soft pasta really grosses me out). The pasta was your regular dried pasta, and not of a high quality semolina, either. It's your garden-variety grocery store pasta (think Creamette).  The pasta sauce was not sticking to the noodles, leading us to believe that the pasta had probably been rinsed so that no starch coating remained to cling to the sauce. Of course, the extra water still on the pasta might have also caused this. The pasta had no flavor; we also don't believe the water in which it was cooked had been salted.   There was also too little sauce for the amount of pasta. And, it was not a slow-cooked meat sauce, but a marinara sauce with meat added to it. When I see \"meat sauce\" on an Italian-American menu, I expect red gravy with meat, long simmered, not some kind of cobbled together crushed tomato from a can with meat sauteed and added.  The three meatballs were of decent size and might have been house-made. We weren't sure, because they had so much filler in them (the ratio of meat to breadcrumb was low). My homemade meatballs are much better. My husband did not finish two of his meatballs, because he also did not like the taste (more dried herb than meat, with a bit of bitter garlic in the mix). We brought them home for our puppies.   A manager came to apologize after our meal (I'd asked the server to speak with him but to wait until we finished eating). He said he had had a talk with the line cooks (and I agree the worst problems were due to poor technique and lack of care / quality control in the kitchen). However, he did not offer to reduce our bill or provide a dessert or other compensation for the experience.  The best part of our experience was the air conditioning. It was a hot day and the space was pleasantly cool."}
{"text":"Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.    Never again.    Mother's Day 2016 was spoiled by waiting two hours for delivery, then generously tipping the driver only to learn we had been delivered a thick pepperoni pizza instead of the thin mushroom that we had ordered.   After a two hour wait, we hoped to reach the business by phone to inform them and salvage the chance to get our correct pizza before it was delivered to someone else. But alas, every time we called we were immediately and unceremoniously placed on hold.  (and subjected to the indignity of a recorded message telling me how much they cared about customer service...) So I got in my car and drove two miles to return the incorrect pizza.  No one said they were sorry, no one offered any comfort. This place is living on its past glory and while the food tastes good, I can not willingly subject my family and friends to future disappointment.   So it was Meatheads for Mother's Day burgers. One star for the memories, and because Yelp has not figured out a way to record zero stars."}
{"text":"Chicago-style pizza is a religious sort of thing.  Maybe you think Gino's East is the best, maybe Giordano's.  Maybe you think that Papa Del's can't possible compare.  All that's fine if you're willing to make a five-hour pilgrimage every time you want to eat pizza.  But most people aren't, so it's good that Papa Del's is at least in the ballpark.  This is really great pizza, and easily the best Chicago-style you're going to get in Champaign.  Plus they've got a deep-dish by-the-slice on weekdays for lunch."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Champaign by a long shot. I come from Chicago and love Lou Malnati's and have yet to find a pizza that compares, but this is the closest around. I would not recommend ordering salads or other dishes from my experience, but its a pizza place and that do that very well."}
{"text":"Even though it takes about 50 minutes for the pizza to cook, they sell it by the slice during lunch time so you can get it right away. 1 piece is plenty to get me full and is under $3. (Between 3-4 they sell the leftover slices at half price, until they run out)  Papa Dels is my favorite pizza place on campus!"}
{"text":"Papa Del's was highly recommended by everyone I knew when I moved there in 2012, and rightly so. The deep dish pizza is great, with plenty of toppings, sauce, and cheese. The crust is a little doughy, but still tasty. The breadsticks are closer to sliced bread than the breadsticks you might get at Pizza Hut or Domino's, and they're delicious for it. The light consistency really soaks up dipping sauce, and they're not greasy at all. You should definitely get a loaf or two for your table while you wait for your pizza to come out. Of course, since it's fresh Chicago-style pizza, you will be waiting a good 45 minutes or so for your pizza to be ready, so be prepared for that. If you go for lunch, though, you can buy pizza by the slice for a very reasonable price and it'll be out in a few minutes.  Their new location is big, modern, and yet classic. It's built in an old factory and retains some of the machinery, which is cool, but also has a lot of new furniture. Some people have said the quality of the food went down when they moved to the new building, but I haven't noticed any difference. It's still a Chambana mainstay, and for good reason!"}
{"text":"Damn, just... damn...  Great, great deep dish pizza. Comparable to Chicago pizzas (well, maybe better because is cheaper).  The waiting is long, but give them a credit cause its said on the menu (45min minimum waiting). Well, if you go with friends, just order some pitcher and wait for it having a nice conversation.  I've been here twice, and just loved.. the price is a bit out of the average cirty range, but its worth it.  I would add that the price difference between the Original Sicilian Pan and the Suer Stuffed Pizza is not worth it. The super stuffed only comes with and extra layer of crust above the pizza. You get more by ordering a original sicilian with more toppings."}
{"text":"We heard Papa Del's had quite the reputation, so we gave the place a try. We weren't disappointed.   Good food. Good service. Great prices. Nice atmosphere.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Don't count on them being open during posted hours. Heard this place was great then found out they close early . Pretty crappy service to close earlier than posted. If you don't want the business at that time, then post different hours. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"The delivery boy Paris was excellent but the manager needs to be retrained on his custumer service.you don't know who you are delivering to so you should always try to please and impress!"}
{"text":"Simply the best pizza in CU. I grew up in the Chicago area and consider myself a pizza snob. This is definitely on par with Giordano's or Gino East, two very well know Chicagoland Pizzerias. I highly recommend all of their pizza, especially their deep dish."}
{"text":"What happened? Papa Dels used to be one of the most formidable food venues in town. It used to be on the same tier as Black Dog and Maize being a Champaign staple. Sad to say that since it moved locations, this is no longer the case.  The super stuffed pizza is still pretty awesome, rivaling even the best Chicago style deep dish restaurants. However, the last time I was there, we all received pizza by the slice that seemed like it was kept under a heating lamp. Which is weird because it took an hour to come out. Tasted awful. The service also lost a step after the location change, which is to be expected.  Honestly, Papa Dels did need to upgrade their venue. But the new spacing is a bit awkward and almost too spread out. Which I wouldn't care as much about if the food and service stayed the way it was before.   I'm holding out hope that Papa Dels will find its swagger back and return to elite status soon."}
{"text":"True chicago style pizza. My favorite place around for pizza when family comes for the weekend"}
{"text":"In the fast food world of college campus towns, every place should have a traditional place that stands the test of time. That's Papa Del's. Quality pizza & sandwiches with great flavor, huge portions & reasonable prices keep you coming back. Service is slow and the building's architect should have been fired @ the first drawings review, but it's all about the food here & it is good."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST pizzeria in the Champaign-Urbana area. They are the only place around that serves authentic Chicago deep-dish pizza, though not exclusively; they also do excellent traditional thin crust pizzas as well as sandwiches and other appetizers.   The campus location offers dine-in, delivery, or carry out. Be warned that the dine-in option is limited by space. All the tables are essentially crammed into a corner, which not only makes for a sometimes spatially uncomfortable seating arrangement, but also for a very unamusing game of who can shout the loudest to overcome the raucous echoes from other tables.   Whether you dine in or out of the restaurant, expect a longer wait that usual. This isn't the usual pizza, so naturally it requires more than the usual time to prepare. Regardless, Papa Del's is worth experiencing - don't leave Champaign without doing so!"}
{"text":"This was my absolute favorite pizza place while a student on campus. We came in the day after a football game and we were so excited because it had been such a long time since we had the famed Papa Del's pizza. Instead, the new Papa Del's has the feel of a cheap Applebee's restaurant and all of the original character is lost. Not to mention, we ordered a medium pizza and an hour and a half into our wait, the waiter informed us (with no remorse) that they messed up the order. We could get a free pizza if we wanted to wait another 45 minutes. I've written maybe 2 yelp reviews in my entire life but this called for one. We chose to start driving back to Chicago which we should have done an hour and a half earlier. Terrible service, no character to the \"new\" restaurant and one very disappointed alum."}
{"text":"The pizza is always amazing and always fresh. I always get the deep dish pepperoni and it is amazing. I have not yet dined-in, but have heard it can be a little bit of a wait. But what do you expect with a booming pizza business? I always do delivery/pick-up and am always satisfied."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Champaign county and always a favorite. Ingredients are always fresh and they have a nice selection of regional beers. The repurposing of an old Coca Cola bottling plant is clean, open, and modern."}
{"text":"So, the food is so awesome here that I do not mind waiting an hour for a deep dish pizza to be served to me.   I'll admit I'm a big fan of deep dish, and not everyone is...but I've also tried their regular crust pizza and it's also quite tasty.   The seating is one of the drawbacks of this place though.  Sometimes this place gets so packed that you can't get a seat for another half hour from when you arrived, BUT at least you can put your pizza order in and save time, which is great.  It would be great if the place looked cleaner, but I don't really mind because the food is tasty.  In my earlier post I said the waiters are pretty good.  I TAKE THAT BACK! They are terrible. There is actually one girl in particular that is just obnoxious. When I came with a group of friends we made sure to order half vegetarian pizza and half meaty pizza. Sounds easy enough. Well, the waitress ended up bringing us a full meaty pizza and when I told her that's not what we ordered she said \"I heard all meat\" and walked away. SERIOUSLY? When she came back to fill our drinks my other friend got really pissed and said you could have at least offered to fix the problem...she just rolled her eyes and walked away. Finally, she ended up bringing a personal thin crust for my bf, but it was ridiculous the attitude she gave us. Isn't the customer always right? I clearly stated what we wanted on our pizza, is that so hard to understand?  Despite the terrible service, I'd say this is the best pizza place in Urbana-Champaign, and sometimes even when I'm in Chicago i cannot help but get a craving for Papa Dels deep dish. MMM"}
{"text":"Rumors are true. This was so disappointing. It gets two stars, because we were seated quickily and our appetizer came out in under 10 minutes. Then we waited an hour and 15 minutes for the thin crust pizza which is only supposed to take 30 minutes. After ordering, we were warned it may take up to 45 minutes, but really an hour and fifteen minutes for a thin crust is ridiculous,  and had we known it was going to take that long, we would have gone to Meatheads."}
{"text":"A classic pizza joint on a college campus and we sure enjoyed it. Bake times are relatively long so be prepared if you have little kids. Either deep dish or the thin are both great."}
{"text":"Just an update, they do deliver!  It was crazy expensive, but worth it!  A medium frozen pizza with extra cheese and pepperoni costs about $110 next day delivery from Champaign to CA.  It was one of my memorable birthdays :)."}
{"text":"The best deep dish pizza ever.  The first time I ate here I could only eat one slice.  I have now graduated and can eat almost 3.  I want to eat even more, but I can't handle it.  We now order from the Crossing location since it is closer to home, but we used to pick-up from this location (they didn't deliver to our area). If you are going to sit down, a couple things to note.  1) parking sucks during busy periods.  2) It takes 45 min to cook the pizza...so you will have to wait.   My family sent me a couple of their frozen pizzas through the mail service, but the pizzas do not cook the same at home.  If you absolutely can't get good deep dish pizza wherever you are located, I can understand ordering it.  Otherwise, just wait till the next time you are in Champaign to get some."}
{"text":"I've gotten pick up from here twice now and I've had a great experience. The pizza was ready when I got there when they told me that it would be ready. And it's absolutely delicious. The low ratings I'm seeing are mostly about service but I feel as time goes on and they get acclimated to the new location it will improve greatly. For now I'll keep on getting pick up but I would love to try eating in some time!!"}
{"text":"We love the pizza but the service was horrible! We were there 2 hours and then when I tried to pay my bill I was told I had to pay my server, I begged please let me pay you and leave.....back to table to wait on the server who was absent most of the night. Call and order it to go a couple hours ahead of time don't go in!"}
{"text":"Tried when first opened in the new location and tried yesterday... the service was the worst a year ago and is still the worst now.  We were seated at a table in the corner which was promptly forgotten and had to track down someone to actually give us service after waiting for like 15 minutes and trying to flag someone down.  Once we did get a server, we were told the person whose section we were in didn't come into work... OK, then why seat someone there?  Turns out she was there, just super slow and then got mad at us for another server \"taking\" her table.  She also tried to get us to order with her twice even after we'd already had our pizzas in (pre-order before seating), had our drinks, and had a salad on the way.  After an hour (more like an hour and a half with the original wait before table), we were given one of two pizzas and told that the other one was 15 minutes out for some lame reason.  The one that came out was the stuffed one (65 minutes by the menu time) and the one that didn't come out was the thin crust one (35 min by menu time).  What was clearly going on was someone forgot to make the second pizza and told the server to go lie about it.  The server, to her credit, did immediately say that she was going to get a manager and that this wasn't right.  We got a \"shift-leader\" instead, but she did comp the one pizza and we were like \"we're done, box it and we're leaving.\"    I've worked in several pizza places (including one that makes stuffed) and two Italian places, I know my Italian food and I could clearly see that as fresh as the second pizza was, it was clearly an \"oh, crap, we forgot to actually make this one and we're not going to fess up to it\" type of situation.  A business that has been in town for as long as this one has, should know how to do game day service. They've had years of possible practice and they still can't bring their A-game when it matters.  Maybe we'll get carry out in the future, but we will never dine in again after this second round of terrible service a year after the last round of terrible service."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  They have some of the best deep dish pizza I've ever tasted!!  Like, OMG it's sooo good!!!  Yes. You will wait a while to get it. So sit back with your friends and/or family, and enjoy spending time with them, while you wait for the amazing pizza that's sure to please everyone. And it's worth the wait (and any potentially awkward conversations you must endure. You only came with a group because no one can eat a whole Papa Del's pizza by themselves! And who wants to sit alone at a restaurant? (On the other hand, who wants to share something this delicious?) )  I kid, but seriously, it's worth it!  If you leave this place still hungry....you are doing something very very wrong. (Unless you got your food to-go, because you won't have eaten it yet!!)  It is scrumptious. I don't know what I like more...the cheese, or the sauce? It's different than anything I've ever had.  Every time I've been here, it's been crowded, or at the very least, it's busy. That's always a good sign! And the service has always been good.  I love this place. Excuse me, I have to go wipe the drool off my keyboard..."}
{"text":"Let me say this: In the many years I've had a Yelp account, the only other 1 star review I've written is for a now-closed medical clinic where a nurse injected me with a medication I was allergic to after mistaking me for another patient. Hopefully that provides some context for how truly awful this place is to warrant my 1 star.  Avoid this place like the plague. It took me and one other person over two and half hours to eat.  Arrived at 7:30 on a Sunday night and told it'd be 15 minutes to get a table, despite the place only being half full and dozens of empty tables. No big deal though, we went ahead and placed our deep dish order, knowing deep dish typically takes about an hour to make. -7:45 we got seated -8:00 we got waters and placed an appetizer order. ***Here's a pro tip: you'll want to either sip really slowly or bring a bottle of water with you since you will be offered exactly 0 refills. Our waiter was so comically bad we could (and should have?) have walked to the gas station on Hessel and bought a bottle of water and come back before seeing him again. -9:00 asked our waiter about the status of our appetizer that we'd placed with him a full hour earlier (literally garlic bread, which takes 5 minutes to toast), and our waiter responded \"what appetizer?\" -9:20 garlic bread finally arrives. It's garlic bread, it's fine.  -9:30 waiter delivers what he thinks is our pizza & leaves. We realize it's not our pizza... The table beside us let's us know it's theirs so I walk the pizza over to them. -9:40 the waiter delivers our pizza to a couple of tables down, who realize it isn't their pizza, ask the tables in the vicinity to find out whose pizza it is, and send it over to us. -9:41 realize this is literally the worst deep dish I've ever had in my life, which includes frozen deep dish from the grocery store. It's essentially Ragu over a block of melted Kraft mozzarella. -10 we finally pay and leave. Never got an acknowledgement/apology/discount of the long wait from our waiter.   Here is one final tip, which I really don't think I should have to tell a restaurant, but here I am having to say it... Please do not play CSI on your big screen TVs while people are trying to eat. I really don't want to see a grisly crime scene or the intricacies of an autopsy during dinner."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in central Illinois. To me it rivals the likes of Chicago's Giordano's. I get the deep dish sausage and don't look back. They also have $3 slices for lunch!"}
{"text":"I subscribe very strongly to the belief that bad pizza does not exist. Even the worst pizza is, at the very least, edible.  That said, Papa Del's, which should be near the top of the pizza pantheon falls squarely short of mediocre. I know I'm in a very, very small minority here but honestly, I'd just as soon get Pizza Hut. It's cheaper and doesn't take as long. For me, the taste is about the same.  Part of this could be my status as a \"thin-crust guy\" but even after trying their thin crust, I wasn't impressed. Besides the sauce being of the persuasion that induces heart burn 90% of the time for me, the crust wasn't like a cracker, but more like cardboard. I won't comment too much on the deep dish, but I will say that the sausages were nice and crispy which is something I'd like to see more on pizza in general. The crust, which should be the best part of deep dish was kind of chewy...  ...for me. I'm not the definitive pizza reviewer.  I would give this place three stars; however, minus one star for service, which was really bad. We had a large group and one of the servers in particular was rather abrasive when we asked to have a large table. Our main server didn't do a good job either of keeping drinks filled, which normally is not a pet peeve for me, but when I've gone an hour sans fill up, I tend to get cranky."}
{"text":"So sorry Papa Del's. We went here after a long drive which included a bunch of traffic getting us into town around 8 pm for an admitted student day the following day.  We checked into our hotel and came right over.  It was around 8:15.  We quickly ordered our pizzas knowing it may take 1/2 hour.  We were also swindled into ordering the garlic doughnuts. Beware!  These are just balls of pizza dough with a smattering of garlic butter on top for 8 bucks.  Knowing what I know about the evils of carbs, I ordered them anyway.  Be not like me!  I command you!   They were not surprisingly, flavorless and unnecessary and guilt-inducing.  I ordered I small side salad also, which did not arrive for an actual hour.  When it did arrive it was like we had entered a time warp.  It consisted of head lettuce with some cheddar shred on top and strangely placed tomatoes  (like salads from the days of yore).    So, as time passed, we grew wearier and wearier,  wondering what we had gotten ourselves into.  After 1.5 hours, and at 9:40,  the pizza was served.  It wasn't freezing cold, but it wasn't very warm either. At least for all of our waiting, the pizza was just ok.  I realized then that you really can't go back.( I had remembered it very differently from my days there of beer and dandelions).  (as opposed to wine and roses, if you didn't get that)."}
{"text":"Umm... yes sir may I have another?  I had lowered my expectations given the hype from Campus Eats, but this place delivered big time!  The homemade dough is extraordinary-- the deep dish crust is like eating an awesome scratch breadstick.  The rest of the pizza was deeelish.  I had the weekly slice special sausage and spinach.  A perfect combo of crust cheese sauce and toppings. Even the side Italian salad was noteworthy great in presentation and eating.  The dressing was terrific too.  Friendly and timely service with a totally clean and mod dining area.  I'm stopping here every visit to UofI."}
{"text":"Andrea and Vanessa were a lifesaver today, we had my daughters 1st birthday party at another venue and the people no showed! Imagine 40 guests standing outside for almost 30 minutes waiting for someone to arrive.  So we went to Papa Del's and they accommodated us and helped us out in a pinch and did a fantastic job serving us! Even with a packed house with the NCAA tourney on they sacrificed half of their restaurant for us.  Thanks for making my daughters 1st bday possible."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend that used to attend the university here. We stopped here after a long day of driving from Asheville, North Carolina.   The place is much bigger than I expected, and the staff was welcoming. There are a lot of tv's centered around the bar area where we sat to watch some hockey. They offered a decent variety of beer from Illinois, which is always a plus in my book. Our server was very attentive and offered different suggestions, and even opted to bring us a few samples of beers he thought we would like.   We started off with a Caesar salad, which was pretty average. Their pizza is all homemade so they list the approximate wait time which is between 40-65 minutes depending on what kind of crust you want. We opted for the thin crust which was our servers recommendation and man was it impressive. They definitely do not skimp on the toppings and put a sufficient amount of cheese. The thin crust wasn't as thin as I'm used to in Minnesota, but having the deep dish options more popular in the Illinois/ Chicago area it's not too surprising.   All in all I would recommend this place for someone looking for a unique homemade pizza!"}
{"text":"Everyone is accurate. The service here is horrible. I waited 85 minutes for a small pizza at 7:30 pm on a Monday night."}
{"text":"Good stuff. Pricey by normal pizza standards."}
{"text":"We came here because a family friend used to come 40 years ago and said it was the best deep dish in the world. It did not disappoint! It does take a long time, but they warned us and the staff were great. The crust is firm enough to eat a slice with your hands and the flavoring in the sauce and toppings is outstanding. Delicious! And a good beer list, too!"}
{"text":"Pizza takes awhile but my server was honest and upfront about it.  Believe me ITS WORTH THE WAIT!  Pizza is the best I've ever had and I'm an Italian foodie. The restaurant is clean and comfortable and has an enjoyable ambiance.   My server, Cassie, was awesome!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good but not the real deal.  The big 3 pizza deep dish places in Chicago I feel are better."}
{"text":"So I used to love papa dels would always get it when I came to Illinois (usually3-5 times a year) traveling but since that met moved to the new location the food is always over cooked i am so bummed about this however the decorations are nice the building is nice to me if the food goes down a notch it really isn't worth the price anymore I feel like I could try one more time but honestly if we still have over cooked pizza forget that I just won't be bothered anymore there are many other good restaurants to eat at in the area why waste the money on over cooked pizza"}
{"text":"Papa Dels singlehandedly raised my expectations for what ridiculously good pizza should taste like. I remember when I used to think Pizza Hut was actually edible.... Thankfully I discovered Papa Dels deep-dish and have never looked back! This is no doubt the best pizza in Champaign-Urbana, and it definitely holds its own against the more famous Chicago deep-dish pizza places."}
{"text":"Well let me start off with- Overrated, overrated, overrated-Every time i'm in this place I wonder why I come. I feel like magically the pizza is going to get better and time and time again i'm disappointed. The place is dirty, the service is dopey...and I don't think there are enough sugar packets to keep the tables from tipping. The pizza is blah....not that i'm a huge fan of Chicago deep dish, but Giordano's, Lou Malnati's does it way better and that isn't even my favorite chicago pizza place (Pequods by the way). When you're standing there looking like a lost orphan and notice that there are several other individuals that look to be in the same state waiting, waiting, waiting....for what??? I've become much less tolerant as of late on waiting, customer service is my pet peeve and if you can't be on time with my order (within reason) then you don't deserve my business...your time is not worth more than mine. I'd prefer to go to Amanos, better pizza by far and very nice people that appreciate your business. No, I do not have any connection with the shop....I wish...but i'd prob be 50 lb heavier-"}
{"text":"Truly authentic Chicago style pizza! My boyfriend is from Chicago and although we now live in central Indiana, we still love a good Lou Manalti's pie when we get a chance.  We had never been here before, and although it was about 7pm on a Saturday night, we were able to get a table without a wait. There was, however, quite a wait before a server came by to take our order; it was probably 15 minutes and then we finally just flagged someone down.  Boeyond that, everything was great. We ordered a pan pizza and after an hour (which they tell you is the wait time for a pan pizza), it was brought out in all its glory. It was amazing. Just like a Manalti pizza exept it lacked the one thing I HATE about most Chicago style pizzas - the chunky sauce! The sauce was smooth but flavorful and full of spices. I cannot stand chunky pizza sauce so I was very excited. It was SO GOOD. The slices were so thick and loaded that I was full after just one. We ended up taking more than half the pie home.  Our dining partners had the \"thin crust\", and I use quotes because it really was what I would consider to be hand tossed in thickness. It looked wonderful and I would like to try it next time.  All in all, worth the wait. The building is set up oddly but they make it work. There is a full bar and the menu also includes pastas and sandwiches if you are not feeling a pizza."}
{"text":"First of all, this is NOT Chicago-style deep dish.  Anyone comparing it to that, good or bad, is hopelessly unclear on what Chicago-style deep dish.  This is its own, unique, super-duper over-the-top crazy-thick deep dish.  To be fair, it Papa Del's failed in the marketing department by not making that clear up-front that this is something special and different.  The crust is thick, bready, and delicious.  The sauce is wonderful, and the cheese is a mile thick.  Stick to their pan pizza, though.  The double-stuffed or whatever isn't the perfect proportions that their pan pizza is.  And avoid vegetables, as they put them under the cheese so they don't really get cooked (a la Montreal-style pizza).  And their homemade sausage is just as spectacular as the pizza is, so if you're not vegetarian, be sure to get that topping.  But please, again, stop comparing this place to Chicago-style deep dish.  It breaks me heart!  We have a new Giordonno's in Champaign; if that's the style pizza you want, go there, but don't knock Papa Del's for not being something it never intended to be!"}
{"text":"Best deep dish in town, nay south of Chicago. Orders take a while but that's to be expected with pizza this size. Sausage is amazing too. Breadsticks aren't my fav but decent."}
{"text":"Delighted to be in their new location.  The building is fascinating. Super stuffed pizza delicious as always. Yes, long waits. It takes that long to make pizza this good. The wait times are on the menu. Look forward to coming back. Plenty of easy parking now!"}
{"text":"We loved the old Papa Dels. Yeah it took awhile even for thin crust but it was good and fun experience. We just tried out the new one. I didn't like reading the reviews on here about the new location bc I was like, seriously people???, it's good pizza. But now I eat my words. 1.5 hrs getting there at 430pm. We ordered a thin crust and it was not that busy in there. Sure they could have a lot of take outs or call aheads but still. And the thin crust tasted nothing like it did from both previous locations. It was too well done and just not good. They were out of breadsticks at 430???? Really ? I don't think we'll be back. Sad."}
{"text":"Based on the testimonials from other Yelpers, sounds like it was a good call to enjoy Papa Del's from the comforts of my in-law's home. We had champagne to accompany our Chicago-style pizza, which is my new favorite eating-take-out-at-home thing - the champagne and pizza combination, not necessarily Chicago-style.  It's like eating a pie o' pizza and, apparently, Papa Del's does it better than most joints in The Windy City. Stuffing is entirely customizable and we were treated to a sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers and onions smorgasbord. My mom-in-law also raves about a spinach something or other.  PRO'S: Eat less to feel satiated, didn't seem as oily. CON'S: Gotta use utensils to eat hot (just had some cold for lunch, sans fork and knife).  Sorry Papa, this is one time I'm picking a girl over a guy - I'll forever be enamored to my Hot Mama's."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Especially since you're stuck 3 hours from Chicago, if you're near this place.  =)"}
{"text":"On the rare occasions when I go back to Champaign, there are a few places I always need to revisit - the first, obviously, is Dos Reales.  The second is Papa Del's.  Everybody seems to love Papa Del's, and for good reason.  Champaign is not exactly a hotbed of amazing cuisine, but Papa Del's delivers consistently delicious, hot, cheesy deep-dish awesomeness.  There's usually a line, but even on Friday night of homecoming weekend we only waited 30 minutes!  And they had us pre-order our pizza when we put our name in for a table, so by the time we sat down, we only waited about 15 minutes before the pizza arrived.  The beer is dirt cheap (the one thing that makes me want to consider living in a small town), and the pizza really hits the spot.  I'm not a pizza snob by any means - all I know is when I cut that first slice, and the cheese stretches out in delicious strands, and the crust is crispy....I'm a happy girl.  See you next homecoming!"}
{"text":"The big daddy of pizzas.  The Sicilian style pizza is a monstrosity of a pie.  Starting from the bottom, there's, a thick, yeasty bread crust.  On top of that there's a layer of oozing mozzarella cheese.  On top of that are the toppings - sausages the size of meatballs, onions, peppers, whatever, and then there's a sweet tomato sauce slathered over the top of everything.  OMG!  There's no delicate way to eat this beast!  This is the pizza that made U of I famous!"}
{"text":"This place was packed as we went there for lunch during the Big Ten Wrestling tournament. We waited about ten mintues for a table, so not that bad!   We ordered garlic bread, water, a beer, and two slices for him and one for me. Our waitress, then disappeared and I watched our water and beer sit at the bar for about ten minutes. Then the waitress brought waters to another table that sat down after us.   Our water and beer were finally brought to our table and about a minute later so were our slices of pizza. The pizza was good, but not excellent... and lukewarm. It wasn't even hot. We both ordered sausage. The slices were pretty large, and the amount of sausage and cheese was plentiful. As we were finishing, she brought out our garlic bread.   Our waitress never asked if we wanted refills or anything. I asked for the tab, it was $11.50, I put down a $20 and she came back took it and said \"Do you need change?\"..... I was a bit taken aback because of her lack of good, even mediocre service. I simply said yes I'll need change. All in all, it was just OK. Not sure if I'd go back, even if they weren't as busy. I've had much better pizzas, not to mention hot."}
{"text":"I am not going to lie. I was so nervous trying this place for myriad reasons.  I am from the Western Suburbs. I love Stuffed Pizza. First, let me remind you there is a difference between stuffed, deep dish, pan, double dough, thin, and extra thin. Examples:  Papa Del's=Stuffed (stuffed crust, cheese, EXTRA THIN LAYER OF DOUGH, Sauce). Nancy's, Giordano's, and my local favorite growing up, Gianorio's of Winfield excel in making this type of pizza.  Deep Dish=Lou Malnati's/Gino's East (crust, cheese, sauce) Pan= Connie's (THICKer.....crust, sauce, cheese) I want to say Papa Del's Sicilian is very similar to this, but it is their specialty that I have not tried as of yet, but I will soon! Double Dough= Self explanatory. Usually closed to hand tossed. Thin= Average local joints mix between this double dough. Think Home Run Inn, Domino's standard, Papa John's. Pub crust is often used here as well. Cracker thin=specialty, like Vito and Nick's   Anyway, now that we have that all settled, Papa Del's still gave me pause before ordering...especially when I ordered, the clerk didn't seem too happy to know that I had 20 coupons (10 dolla off any L/XL pizza). One of my best friends' sisters actually had a run in at this location with a waitress which is the reason why I had waited so long to try this place! Again, why let some snobby undergrad waitress ruin the nostalagia that is crust, cheese, sauce, and love?  Decided on the Super Stuffed Cheese. 21.64 our total, which was before the coupon. We'd have to wait an hour and since I live 25 minutes from here, it worked out well.  The stuffed pizza was AMAZING! The clerk was actually very nice, the total ended up being under $11 with the coupons, and I had a \"pizza warmer\" in my car for the long drive! SCORE! I thought the crust would be dry, but it was full of flavor! The cheese is the highlight of this pizza for sure! The seasoning in the sauce really wasn't there, but what do you expect in a college town pizza joint? Well, have high expectations for this place!  Some of the best pizza I have ever had! I would put it in my top 10 pizza experiences of my life! Even though the drive through the rain sucked on I 57, I know I will be back!  I was so worried it would not be up to my high standard, but I can't wait to have it again...plus even try the Sicilian! GO TO PAPA DEL'S IF YOU ARE in Champaign!"}
{"text":"Poor service, slow service and the pizza is awful. I know this is suppose to be one of \"Chambana's\" favorite pizza places but I have no idea why.  To me it is very bland/cardboard tasting - the sauce, the cheese, the crust, everything!  Actually I tried the thin crust once and it was slighty better, but not much.  And overpriced."}
{"text":"Mmmmm. Best deep-dish in town.  (Not sure that there's much competition, though.)  Whether ordering delivery or in the restaurant, expect to wait about an hour. I've only been in the restaurant once, and it was nice and relaxed. I've ordered delivery from them countless times whenever I have guests, and it never disappoints. Melty, cheesy, tomatoey...so good. It's kind of pricey, but I usually just eat one to two pieces and am completely stuffed, so it's really not bad."}
{"text":"I went there before an Illini b-ball game. It's crazy busy on game day, so get there early and put your pizza order in while you wait for a table if you want to save some time. The thick crust takes about 40 minutes to bake and if there's a line already, expect your order to take about an hour and quarter. So, it's nice to place the order ahead of time, grab some drinks at the bar, and then get seated with about 20 minutes left to wait for your pizza. Staff is super friendly.  Now for the food... the other reviews don't lie. It's delicious. I like Chicago deep dish and this is some of the best I've ever had. The dough is fantastic and the cheese is melted perfectly. They have a great selection of toppings to build your own pie and it's not too pricy."}
{"text":"A delicious pizza that always leaves you with tons of leftovers and a very full stomach. In the summertime you can come for a lunch special and enjoy the patio. Parking is a BEAR, with a lot of spots you could get towed from. And don't think it's cheap -- you pay for the yummy goodness! But once you're in, sat and eating ... you fall in love all over again."}
{"text":"I miss Papa Del's, even if I live in a pizza wonderland, I remember Papa Del's fondly for where to go in Chambana if you wanted really good, really hearty, deep dish style pizza.  The sauce if very flavorful, and the crust can take it.  I prefer eat in, and never really got papa del's for delivery, but did carry out occasionally.  It does suffer from sogginess when put in that cardboard box, better eaten fresh on location on a plate with a knife and fork.  Not the cheapest pizza in Champaign, just the best."}
{"text":"It's not the BEST deep dish, but it's pretty darn good. Been here multiple times and have never been disappointed. They used to have Shiner Bock on tap, but not anymore. I'll settle for Blue Moon. Friendly wait staff and never a super long wait for a table (unless you decide to go on a game or parent weekend, which I never do). My go-to place for deep dish in C-U"}
{"text":"I do not understand how this pizza is so popular. It's all crust! No comments on the service, as I've only ordered to go."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA IN TOWN  Legendary in every sense of the word. If you are an upstate, chicago person you will probably turn your nose up to their deep dish saying \"it isn't authentic, real chicago deep dish\". But as far as I'm concerned, it is the best deep dish south of I-80.  It isn't lou malnati's or giordano's but thats okay. Its delicious, high quality, awesome pizza. Famous for this sausage, but I still prefer their pepperoni. The deep dish will take ~40 mins to cook. So I always call ahead regardless of if I'm carrying out or eating in to make sure the pizza is ready when I get there. You haven't had the U of I experience until you've been to Papa Del's!"}
{"text":"Orgasmic deep dish pizza. Park in the back of the place and the shop is upstairs. We got one pizza with cheese, and one veggie. Even having leftovers the next day was amazing.  If you have 20 coupons, you get $10 off your order.   In California, nothing compares to papa del's. Don't take this for granted!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Champaign. I wish I had eaten here one last time before I left town."}
{"text":"My wife and I love their pizza, but if our time is limited, or we want to eat healthier, we order the sandwich and salad! Both are very good. And the salad that comes with the sandwich is a good size! I believe the dressing are house made, and are very good!"}
{"text":"Alright. I'm a Chicago boy. I have a deep dish pizza beating in the center of my chest. Don't get me going about what is mistaken for pizza in other parts of the country. That said...this place is great.  My daughter introduced us to this place after a late night trip down to Urbana. Wow. It was better than expected.  Food: Excellent pizza. We had deep dish and it was high quality, flavorful and abundant. Cost was very reasonable.  Service: It was just before closing time and the young fellow taking care of us was attentive, personable and overall just great.  Atmosphere: This place screams college town pizza joint. That should be all you need to know. It reminds me of an old pizza joint that was located on Taylor street in Chicago's little Italy. The place is closed now and there is a high end restaurant (Tuscany) running there now. It was dark, lots of wood and smelled of beer.  Overall: It's a winner. Bring the family or order out. Great Pizza."}
{"text":"The move to Neil St. and a gigantic building is totally justified. This is the best pizza in Illinois -- not even Chicago offers better. It is probably the best restaurant in Urbana/Champaign/Savoy. There is a wait time because they are always busy and, of course, each pizza is made with care. The waitstaff are always pleasant. Worth every dime every time. It's only loud because there are always a lot of people there, which is not surprising at all."}
{"text":"How is this place not 5 stars? They serve true deep dish Chicago style pizza. The crust is perfect. The cheese is thick, tasty, and cooked perfectly to where it gets browned and bubbly where it meets the crust. And the sauce is perfectly seasoned and spooned on thick, just like it should be. The sausage (gotta be homemade) is outstanding. I'm from Chicago and have had the best there and this place is legit."}
{"text":"It's been over 6 months since Papa Del's consolidated their locations, but the place is still something of a disaster. Unless you are visiting on a weeknight, be prepared to sit in the restaurant and wait 2 hours only to find out that your order never made it to the kitchen. Or that your pizza that was supposed to be delivered in 75 minutes is not out of the oven in 2 hours, or that Papa Del's \"thought you were going to pick it up because someone else called and said you would.\" The bottom line: good pizza, terrible management of their new business model. This consolidation has created a situation that probably the best employees could not handle.   I hope this business can get sorted out, because their pizza is really one of a kind. But until they do, I need a long vacation from Papa Del's, which used to be one of my favorite places to visit."}
{"text":"Building remodel looks great. While I've seen many businesses come and go from his location, I do hope Papa Del's finds success here.   Pizza tastes the same as the old location, but I agree with other posters that the service is lacking. Going without drink refills, dirty plates getting picked up, and waiting for a check/getting a check picked up once ready to pay, are just a few service inconsistencies I experienced.   I hope that with some experience, Papa Del's gets the kinks worked out."}
{"text":"People need to calm down, they recently moved into a space that is at least double the size. Of course your food took longer, they were still training the staff as well. It has since settled down and is nearly back to the same pace as the original. Excellent deep dish pizza and the best garlic cheese bread around."}
{"text":"If you ever get to Champaign, this is worth a try. Be prepared to wait about 45 minutes, you can't rush deep dish. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to this place tonight for a relaxing dinner with my daughter for Father's Day weekend at U of I..We preorder the pizza..we were told it would be ready in 20-30 minutes..No problem there..They sit us down at a bench that is clearly broken..Then the seat a family directly behind us we us both sharing the back rest which was clearly broken. Pizza arrives we starting eating..The family behind us starts leaning on the back rest pushing it to the point my head is almost planted onto the table..I ask the servers and they ask if we want to be moved..mind you the people behind us just sat down yet they thought it was wise to get us up move our move etc..We asked for the manager...He shows up with a combative attitude and admits the booth was broken for a week ....\"Knowing the booth was broken you continued to seat people here\" that is when he started swearing and saying something about you chicagoans are all pieces of shit...No apologies etc.I asked the young server what his major was..he said marketing..I said you just got a lesson on how not to be a manager and how not to treat customers especially when you are in the customer service business..Lesson learned I told him..For the record this guys name is BOB..."}
{"text":"Papa Del's is a legendary local pizzeria with a well-deserved reputation for both its deep-dish and thin crust pan pizzas.  They say you can't go home again, but Papa Del's is the exception to the rule. As an Illinois student of the 1980's, I first enjoyed their creations out of the Wright Street location and the long-gone Green Street pizza factory. I would dream about those deep-dish slices and would often stop in when traveling through central Illinois. Relocating myself to Champaign thirty years later, their location is now the sleek, renovated Coca-Cola bottling plant on Neil, but the pizza is just as good as it ever was.   Historically, my favorite has been the deep-dish with extra cheese but lately I've been opting for the thin crust. Both are excellent renditions: deep-dish has a bread-like soft but crispy crust filled with their spicy red sauce and Italian sausage or whatever ingredients are your pleasure, while the thin crust is loaded up with the same and baked on traditional corn meal. Their other offerings are pretty good. I've enjoyed their calamari fritti lightly breaded and fried accompanied by both an aioli and marinara, and the hot spinach dip is also a tasty appetizer with pita chips and crostini. Caesar salads are huge and freshly made.  If you plan to dine in, be prepared for a wait especially on sports weekends. It takes a good 45-50 minutes for a deep dish, a little less for the thin crust, but it's worth the wait.   The only knock I have on this restaurant is that the service is inconsistent. Recently, Giordano's opened a location at Market Place Mall, and while I've loved their pizza in Chicago, I have to ask \"why?\" For my money, it's hard to beat the hometown favorite. One thing Giordano's might be able to teach Papa Del's is how to properly accommodate customers. I've had several great servers at Papa's and a couple really bad ones. (Gabby is my favorite server-always chipper and fast with the drinks and food.) Service needs to be more attentive if you're going to have to patiently wait for your pizza. If Papa's can get this right, I'll be happy to give them that coveted fifth Yelp star, but for now it stays at four."}
{"text":"I am not a huge pizza fan until my fiance' brought me here to eat after a U of I football game. This is the best pizza I have ever eaten and the veggies are fresh and not over done. The crust is homemade. I now crave Pizza as long as it comes from Papa Del's!"}
{"text":"This is the most deplorable service I have experienced from a pizza joint.  I live 3.4 miles away.  I am living supposedly one road away from the delivery service \"cutoff\" (It is an 11 minute drive according to google maps).  I said that I was willing to walk out of my neighborhood (maybe 100 yards) to that road.  They would not deliver, saying that they were already busy enough.  Well, when the time comes when you don't have as many orders booked, Papa Del's, don't count on mine.  The person who I talked to on the phone tonight was rude and incredibly unhelpful.  Based on this experience, even though I liked the pizza when I tried it, I don't plan on patronizing this establishment again."}
{"text":"Papa Del's famous pan pizza is THE BEST PIZZA in history. Period. Every pizza I eat, I compare to papa dels, and nothing comes close. I can't even explain it, you just have to try it. Green pepper and onion is my favorite, but their sausage is phenomenal as well. I also highly recommend their Italian salad. It's soooo good! I've tried to replicate it at home so many times but it's not the same without the homemade vinaigrette. Yum!! I've literally driven from Chicago to champaign just for a pizza from papa dels, and we bring one or two or three home every single time we're in town. (And of course we get some custard cup around the corner for the drive home) You will not be disappointed at papa Del's."}
{"text":"Best pizza in central Illinois.  And the new location on Neil is amazing!  I'll be here SO often!"}
{"text":"not the best pizza i've ever had, but easily the best deep dish you'll find within a 50 mile radius. sure the menu looks pricey, but i'm all about the deals. they have a pizza happy hour type deal, where single slices are half price (until they run out) from 3-4pm. that means $1.50 for a huge slice of sausage. WOWZA.   ask for extra pizza sauce when they bring out your order. i'm a carb lover, but the crust is even too much bread for me.  for appetizers... the soft bread sticks are my fave. warning, they're HUGE. gotta go with the nacho cheese and pizza sauce to accompany it."}
{"text":"Here's a secret: I will do anything for this pizza.   Since every single person in Illinois seems to be some sort of self-crowned pizza expert, I'll tell you upfront: I'm not. I'm just a regular person who eats food. Sometimes I eat that food in Chicago. Most times I eat it in Portland. But in my 28 years of eating food, I've never eaten pizza that I like better than Papa Del's. The last time I was visiting, I even stuffed a frozen pizza into my checked luggage to take back to Portland, where I threw it in the oven a mere 90 minutes after my plane landed. What I mean to say is: this is special, special pizza.  I'm seeing a lot of complaints about service, but that's missing the point. Does one complain about climbing a mountain to obtain wisdom from the guru at the top? (Actually, I probably would.) Yes, the service is miserable, but that's just part of the journey! There are two seating options to choose from while you wait (and wait, and wait): a sterile, cavernous dining room, or the small bar area, where the jukebox will inevitably be blaring an entire Journey album. Oh, neither of those suits you? Sheesh, why not ask Jesus to tidy up his manger while you're at it? The service has never improved at all during the 10 years I've been eating here, so it's futile to even spend time wishing it would; it's just what you have to deal with if you want the pizza.  There is this part of the crust where the cheese sort of gets stuffed inside, and it's all gooey and amazing and occasionally I think about it when I'm supposed to be thinking of something else. I start eating each piece with a fork, but about 2/3 of the way up, I always just give in and eat it with my hands so I can best enjoy those precious bites that meld with the crust. The breadsticks are like giant loaves of bread, and you can get them with the pizza sauce or with this nacho cheese that I would normally reject outright, but for some reason it's amazing here. And really, I can only eat two slices, but sometimes I dare myself to go for three, and damn it if it isn't worth the stomach ache every time. What was it I said before? Oh, yes: this is special, special pizza."}
{"text":"The last time I was here was around 20 years ago when a friend and I flew down in his little plane from Saint Paul to Urbana so he could do some lecturing at the UofI.  On the way out of town we picked up a Papa D's pizza to go.  The box went under the co-pilot seat (me!) and we flew home.  Heated up in back in St. Paul it was wondrous.  Flash-forward to 2015.  My sweetie and I are driving back from DC and have made Urbana the last stop before the last slog to Saint Paul.  After 2 weeks of fish in Iceland (wonderful!), I was ready for some more 'Merican food.  The night before it was BBQ.  What's more American that pizza?  I remembered Papa D's and off we went.  We got a medium, thin crust, with peperoni peppers, olives, and Italian sausage.  And (it IS a college town!) a pitcher of Sam Adams.  It was every bit as good as I remembered.  The left overs were a treat at breakfast.  Next time in Urbana, it's a must-stop place."}
{"text":"I've had stuffed pizza all over and I have to say that this is still my favorite (stuffed, mind you...), by far.  Every so often when I'm in town I grab a large super stuffed with mushrooms, sausage, and spinach home.    The ingredients are fresh and the sauce is very well balanced with just a bit of tang.  That, and they practically put huge chunks of sausage in there.... if they just had whole mushrooms instead of sliced, that would rock."}
{"text":"This is what pizza is supposed to be. Thick, chewy, substantial, no-nonsense, DELICIOUS.  The Platonic ideal.   They have a thin-crust pizza but honestly I've never bothered, nor has anyone else I know. I'm not sure what the point would be.   They lack one star because every so often the bottom of the crust is burned horribly. Sad!!"}
{"text":"Somehow, it took me till my last few weeks of undergrad at uiuc to go here.  I  was expecting the best Chicago style pizza in town, and yeah, it probably is.  But it doesn't compete with Chicago-area Chicago style pizza so I must say I still was a little disappointing.  I got a stuffed pizza with spinach.  I felt like there could have been a lot more spinach on it, and something about the crust just didn't seem right.  It was tasty and pretty soft, but the bottom was surprisingly hard and it seemed like the crust to pizza ratio was too high.  Also, we got a loaf of garlic bread for the wait.  It wasn't bad, but I've made better garlic bread at home.  Some parts of the loaf were just too dry and bland.  It was pretty cheap though, so no big deal.  I guess overall, if you want a Chicago-style pizza, then go for it.  But try to hit up a pizza place in the Chicago area sometime!"}
{"text":"My parents remember this place fondly from their days as poor graduate students at UIUC and 30+ years later, we had the opportunity to visit Papa Del's in Champaign on a visit to the campus.  Although it's moved from their old location, it brought back lots of memories for my parents and we all very much enjoyed our lunch.  Papa Del's was relatively empty at 2pm on a Monday afternoon, but I can imagine it gets crazy during the school year, particularly on a weekend night.  The prices were cheaper than I might have expected (based on visiting some deep dish places in downtown Chicago), and the beer was definitely well-priced.  I can see why it attracted students of UIUC way back in the day and continues to do so now.  We ordered a medium deep dish with Pepperoni, Mushroom, and Extra Cheese.  It was the perfect pizza for 3 people, although I ate half the pizza by myself, and could have kept going had we not had dinner plans about 3 hours later.  We got the Blue Moon on draft, but they also had Sam Adams as well as a few other drafts.   Service was efficient, professional, and courteous, and ambiance was what you'd expect from a college-town pizzeria.  No more, no less.  Overall, it was great to enjoy lunch at Papa Del's not only for nostalgic reasons, but also for the quality of the pizza.  I'm certainly no deep-dish pizza expert, but this place really hit the spot for us!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for our first visit but was unfortunately disappointed by extremely poor service. Our total visit ended up taking almost 2 hours. All we really wanted was a slice of sausage pizza but we were told it wasn't available. Therefore we were forced to order a whole pizza to get what we wanted, which took an hour. In the meantime sausage pizzas by the slice became available as we watched 2 nearby tables order them, eat and leave in a fraction of the time we had to spend there. We also had to continually wait for drinks and other items. Based on our visit it is easy to say we won't be back. Sooooo many other better options."}
{"text":"Their food is great, but I was a tenant above the kitchen and mice and cockaroaches would \"play\" in our living room.  It would not be uncommon to come home late at night and have the mice running around our living room.  The owner \"Bob\" is extremely rude and quite possibly the worst person ever, but the food there is pretty good.  We would also come home during the day with him just rifling through the kitchen.  Bob sucks, but the food does not."}
{"text":"This would probably be a five-star for me, but I am trying not to include nostalgia in the review.  There are two things to tell you.  If you haven't eaten here and are reading this review, then you are probably from out of town.  The one thing I can say that might influence your decision is this: the stuffed pizza here is better than any I can find in Chicago.  Honestly, I have tried everything and keep looking.  Stuffed pizza, foodie pizza, local pizza - none better.  That should be all I need to say.  But once you get there the other thing you need to know is this: the service is epic slow.  Remember when you studied The Odyssey in school and the teacher told you about the oral tradition and it not being written down for a few centuries?  That is how they train the waitstaff here.  For decades the means of serving people in a lovingly slow and sometimes forgetful fashion have been passed down to new staff with such fidelity that I can only call the institutional memory involved Homeric.  Embrace it as part of the experience and realize that the name tags are hand written, the one old thing about the staff is that almost everyone seems new.  The pizza will eventually be delivered, be patient, it will be worth the wait."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if possible  The staff was so rude today  I called early to schedule a delivery and was asked to call later close to the delivery time  When I called, I was left waiting for a long time when finally the attendant said could not hear me I repeated all the information  They went to check if they could deliver  More wait Then they asked for am hour and twenty minutes  Then it was late for me Went to Biaggis and got a great treatment and pizza delivered in 20 minutes"}
{"text":"just had the deep dish pizza, for the 1st time...let's just say that chicago's pizza it is NOT! it's decent, but nothing i'll be anxious to get back to...i think what was most disappointing is the lack of meat toppings - they only have pork sausage, pepperoni, bacon, or anchovies...what's up with that?? so we ordered the bacon, to-go...when we opened the box, after arriving back at our hotel, we saw it was raw!! no really, RAW!! not a good look!! my mom only took ONE bite & was done...my daughter & i just picked off the pork (as it was squealing :) & had a cheese pizza...that wasn't so bad...so, IF i ever eat this pizza again, i will only order the cheese....also, paid $16.95 for a medium pizza...had about 6 decent-sized slices."}
{"text":"The new store recently opened and we decided to get a deep dish pie for carryout on a Thursday. If the pizza was going to be the same as the old location, it was going to be a real treat.  I called over the phone and ordered a medium cheese and sausage deep dish. We were told it would be 1.5 hours before it was ready, which seems like a long time but deep dish does take considerably longer and they seemed quite busy on a Thursday night.  We drove up to the store and walked inside to pick up our pie. The inside of the new restaurant is beautiful. Spacious, well decorated and just fresh/new looking. We should have eaten in.  There was a little trouble claiming our pizza. Apparently the guy on the phone totally butchered my last name and the correct spelling was not coming up on their computer. We managed to search by phone number and thankfully that was heard correctly when I ordered and matched my actual phone number.  The pizza itself was good, I felt. It was almost exactly like the pizza from the old store, with one minor difference that I thought negatively stuck out: the crust.  This crust was very thick and bready. I know deep dish has thick crust, but I felt like this was a little too much. The cheese was pretty thick, but I felt the pizza was lacking sauce. We should have asked for a little extra sauce like we usually do. The lack of sauce made the pizza taste a little dry, and of course really bread-y from the crust being so thick.  The sausage on the pizza was tasty! It was in the form of pretty large round chunks and didn't taste very institutional like the chain pizza place sausage does.  Our 'za cost $17 picked up. At less than $9/person we definitely were full and even had a couple of leftover pieces. The pizza wasn't bad, but again we thought it was a little on the bread-y side and could've used more sauce.  I'd come back."}
{"text":"I went to Papa Del's Pizza, was pretty eager to try it out. Sat down, I'm skeptical after reading about their poor service on Yelp and hearing the same from some locals.   Well, what appeared to be a drunk customer interrupts my server who's taking my order and says he wants to have a word with him (grabs him firmly by the arm). (I only assume he's drunk because most people don't act so aggressive when sober). Then the server realizing how rude this man is, goes to get my drinks before he talks to this disorderly old man. However, then the old man screams across the room, \"Where the hell you going?! I said I want to talk to you!\" He then starts to berate him, something about a free soda and no one gets free sodas.   My server comes back with my drink and I ask who that rude guy is?? He tells me the OWNER; and he was mad because an employee came in to get his check and drank a soda while off the clock (they only get free soda if they are on the clock). The server tells me the owner is always this way and tries to excuse it. I told my server then to tell the owner to buzz off and now he lost an entire order AND my soda which I'm not paying for. And I left."}
{"text":"First thing on arrival from driving 14 hours in the rain, is to get some Papa Dels.  My family just did pick up, so I can't comment on the entire experience of the new location yet, which I will report back on when that happens.  Though it is the old Jillian's, so it is certainly a massive new place.  Anyway, our order was ready right on time when we came to pick it up.  No need to really get into how good the pizzas are here, some of my favorite anywhere.  I am always amazed that they do both Chicago style deep dish and thin crust equally as well.    ...And for all the people complaining about slow service, have you never been to the old Papa Dels on Green St. before?  That is the way it has always been, well before any of these food review sites ever existed.  Get over it, and enjoy the best pizza south of Chicago."}
{"text":"Papa Del, you are one overrated sonofabitch.  Your pizza is edible, but just not the real deal, and your service blows.  You're a staid Chambana eatery, and I respect that, but I just don't think we can be friends."}
{"text":"On rating pizza alone I would give papa dels 10 stars, it is that good, especially their stuffed pizza! However their service and restaurant are terrible. The restaurant is laid out like a dormitory's cafeteria and equally loud. The bar area is somewhat better but whoever designed that restaurant was an idiot. Loud, bright, annoying. Second, delivery. We live near Vine street in Urbana and they consider that out of their delivery area? What?? It used to be (and may still be I haven't checked) that you could not order the stuffed pizza ahead if you were eating there which meant you sat there, using up a table, for a full hour waiting for your amazing pizza. Customers are definitely not their first priority but fortunately amazing pizza is. I recommend pick up."}
{"text":"I've had a million good experiences here, and only one bad. Ordered a thin crust here once, for pickup, and I sat and waited for it near the counter while they overcooked it. But I don't know what possessed me to order thin-crust anyway. I had never done it before and never will again, because their deep pizzas (they have both pan and stuffed) are EASILY the best in Champaign-Urbana. The crust is a lot like Giordano's.   Every time I'm back in Chambana I have to get Del's."}
{"text":"If you're ordering delivery - don't bother!!!  My family ordered last night - we were told the food would be delivered in an hour and 15 minutes.  (1 pizza, 2 sandwiches with salads as our sides.)  After 2-1/2 hrs., I called to see what was going on...\"we're running WAY behind\"...our food wasn't even COOKED yet!!!  Talked to Sharon/Shara or Shawna (didn't understand her name), the \"Shift Leader\", after I asked for the Manager.  She \"comped\" the pizza and said our food was cooking \"as we speak\".  Thirty minutes later, we got 1/2 our order....my husband ordered an Italian beef w/salad.  It's supposed to come with pepperoncini and au jus - he got a burned bun with dried out beef - no pepperoncini, no au jus, no salad -- CRAP.  Our daughter ordered a small pizza -- all ingredients were on it, but it was cold.  I ordered an Italian sausage sandwich with the side salad that goes with it.  Cold sandwich -- and NO salad.  CRAP REPEATED.  Papa Del's made a HUGE MISTAKE when they closed their satellite stores, because they can't provide service to all their customers anymore.  I guess that's why THEY ARE LOSING CUSTOMERS DAILY.  It's a shame - they used to serve the best pizza in Champaign, we ate there for years.  No more - never again.  Call somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Ate in for my dad's birthday....service was terrible. Said I wouldn't come for dine in ever again. Fast forward a couple weeks....I decided to try carry out with slices. I was told they are pre made slices and should be ready in 2 minutes. 20 minutes later....I'm still waiting. What the heck is going on with this place?"}
{"text":"The first deep dish pizza I've ever tried was at a place called Giodorno's. I bring this up since that seems to be a Yelp highlight of this establishment. I found Giodorno's pizza quite average... And I have to agree, the deep dish pizza here is of average quality as well. For neophytes, know that ordering deep dish pizza can take 40-60 minutes to prepare. The service was amiable enough though."}
{"text":"We stopped in Champaign on our cross country trek.  After looking at reviews of various pizzerias, we decided to try Papa Del's and the research was well worth it!  One of the best pizzas I've had!!  A tasty reward after a long day's drive!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry everyone.  Maybe it's not fair that I review this as I love thin crust pizza so much.  Maybe it's also not fair that I was served after the pizza was delivered, and then I waited in line for several minutes.  Maybe it was the ridiculous hype that everyone brought with it that was its downfall.  With those things in mind: one of the worst... pizzas... ever.  I took a quick picture on my phone (see: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u8C8pRvaHXg3PgDrsUHJHQ?select=KEIMjrhuV466cpYyYI8nhw) and sent it to a friend.  He wrote back calling it bread lasagna.  Maybe it wasn't very good because it had been sitting out for 5 or 10 minutes after being delivered.  It had almost no flavor though.  And it was ALL bread.  I've had deep-dish before that was much better.  I would be willing to try it again, fresh, at the restaurant; if I didn't live 1000 miles away."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok -- the crust was nice and buttery, but the sauce was a bit sweet and under-seasoned."}
{"text":"The more I have it the less impressed I am. Pretty good deep dish that takes about 45 minutes. More crust than actually pizza to the point where we were actually cutting off some of the bottom portion to make it edible. Service when dining in is usually great but I recently had an experience with a young waitress that irritated me to say the least. Just not to active with our table when the restaurant was pretty much empty. On the other hand, the thin crust pizza is on par with Lou Malnatis from Chicago but I think I'll stick with ordering out the next time around."}
{"text":"Oh.My.God.  Serious pizza orgasm.  I'm not even kidding.  If you don't stop by this place while in Urbana and try their pizza then I would say, in the immortal words of Mr. T, I pity the fool.  I'm actually looking into getting it mailed to me in Southern California.  Seriously, GO!"}
{"text":"After about two slices your stomach is going to be tapped, but you'll still reach for a third slice. Be careful; over-eating here is commonplace. This is really good Chicago-style pizza, especially being so far away from Chicago. Has a crisp crust, soft/gooey/melty cheese, flavorful sauce, tender meat... Definitely the place to get your pizza fix."}
{"text":"Best Pizza-in C-U. The thick (it's NOT Chicago-style Pan) is amazing and unlike anything I've ever had anywhere else. I've been going there 30+ years and it's always been great.  Get it to go-service is slowwwww."}
{"text":"My family and I went there for dinner about an hour and a half before closing.  We ordered one small and one large stuffed pizza.  The menu listed the wait as about one hour, which was fine with us.  Right after we arrived, a much larger group was seated next to us.    After about an hour, the other group received a large stuffed pizza.  However, they quickly called the waitress back as that pizza contained sausage and they appeared to be vegetarian.  The waitress took the pizza away, and we didn't see her again for about 10 minutes.  She finally came back to our table with the smaller pizza and immediately began into a story about how the tables were misnumbered and that she delivered our pizza to the other table.  She did not apologize, suggest any alternatives, nor offer any compensation.  The small pizza was woefully inadequate to feed our entire party, and it contained anchovies that were not acceptable to the rest of the party.    We then asked to see the manager.  A young college-aged guy in a t-shirt and shorts was presented himself as the manager.  He neither apologized or offered compensation.  He insisted that we pay for the small pizza finish and go.  When pressed, he offered to serve us the pizza that was delivered to the other table, even though it was partially consumed.  His attitude was unsympathetic and dismissive.  This was by far the worst service we had ever experienced at a restaurant.  We loudly told him just that, but he was unimpressed.  We paid for the beers and left."}
{"text":"The restaurant was busy so I asked if we could sit at the bar, which the hostess graciously said yes. We sat at the bar and after only about 5 min, the bartender was extremely rude to our son and said \"you need to move over, we need this space for our drinks.\" We didn't realize we were in their \"space.\" There was no need for him to be so ignorant. We decided to get up and leave and he didn't even care."}
{"text":"I really don't get what all the fuss is about.  The pizza is just okay...a little dry and bland."}
{"text":"When I fall in love, I fall hard.  Imagine, a scared college freshman away from home for the first time.  Ready for new experiences...ready for deep dish pizza, oh yes.  I can remember my first pizza at Papa Del's as clearly as last night's.  (Well maybe last night's is a little clearer because the leftovers are in my fridge.)  You can go home again if home is for the best deep dish pizza this Illini fan has ever had.  This is our eighth year of being the proud parents of U of I students and boy are we glad they weren't in college at the same time.  Not to avoid double tuition payments but to stretch out those Papa Del's pizzas.  When we come here after football games, we know it will be a huge wait.  Before Basketball games is much easier.  Last night I actually had allotted 2 hours and we were completely done in a little over an hour and had surprisingly good service.  (It's a campus pizza place, 'nuff said for service expectations.)  While you wait for your pizza you can talk to your family!  Have an Italian salad and then some cheesy garlic bread.  Then be prepared to fall in love and have an emotional affair with pizza that will last a lifetime."}
{"text":"Tried this place again since I live so close to it and I am never going back. I grew up in Chicago and this is NOT authentic Chicago deep dish. The pizza is 80% dough and tastes bland and disgusting. Frozen microwave Connie's Pizzas from County Market taste more authentic than this crap."}
{"text":"Pizza as always is fantastic but ordered cookies this time to go and they were burnt tasting shouldn't taste  burnt  hard crunchy burn on appetizer  it was great so go for the pizza though"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst sevice on earth. Always an hr past what they quote for carryout or in. Constant excuses. The thing is that this would be so easy to fix. They just dont give a shit. Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Arrived at 4:45 pm the greeter was rude and sit us next to a couple with unruly 4 and 2 yr olds whinnying. Ordered ice tea not fit for consumption. Appetizer came after 30 min and thin crust pizza about 15 min later. While we were there 3 couple left without being served.The waitress had an argument with the greeter about seating more people in her area pretty sure her area was the whole place. Didn't like the pizza either. Save yourself the grief just go to Monicals"}
{"text":"Read the reviews, so I decided to order an Original Sicilian Pizza.   Even though the manager messed up the order, he did start another pizza fresh from scratch and gave me half off.  I tried the pizza and it was really good.  My first taste of a Deep Dish Pizza.  I usually just order thin crust, but was tempted to try something new.  The sauce tastes fresh, the crust was well-cooked, and the mozzarella was fresh.  This is actually a good place.  You should try it out!  A+"}
{"text":"Great pizza, my mom even said she thought it was better than Chicago style IN Chicago. I don't know if I'd go so far as to say that, but it is some damn good pizza.   I've never had a type of pizza there I dislike. Last time I had spinach and fresh garlic which was fantastic, though I usually order plain cheese or sausage.   Note: If you're on a time crunch, either don't go here, or call in your order ahead of time. They warn you it takes 55 minutes, and it really does take that long... if not longer. It's worth the wait, if you have the time."}
{"text":"I ate this pizza for ten straight hours, and when I was done, I applauded. It was far, far better than the best pizza I could possibly imagine, and it has restored my faith in God."}
{"text":"I've been weak in the knees for Papa Del's since I was a coed, and that hasn't changed. A girl, whether shes 18 or 80 (no I'm not THAT old!) still gets a bit giddy for quality and substance.  I used to wait in line outside the old Papa Del's on Wright street back in the day, in the ice and snow and windy cold, for my share of one of their delectable pies. Now, it's far more convenient but the flavor hasn't changed a bit! Papa is still the king!"}
{"text":"I drove back to Champaign one summer afternoon from Chicago just for this pizza.  It was one of those June afternoons where the terrifying thunderclouds roll in, disorganized, with internal lighting jumping around inside like a Kraken's spine in a blender.  I ordered from Papa Del's. I waited an eternity, and garbage cans aloft and floating down the street, with rain shooting sideways, I ran to my car and opened the box and I ate every slice.  It took me two days, but I ate every slice  This is the pizza you want when you're in college but can never afford.  Heaven."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this pizza. The restaurant boast several seating areas that accommodate the usual large crowds. Personally, carry out is the best option so you don't have to wait 45 minutes for your deep dish pizza to bake. The Sicilian style pizza will continue to be a tradition on the University of Illinois campus."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at the Green Street location. I can say that the location at The Crossing (Windsor and Duncan) is the best pizza in town. Here's why: 1. The sausage is stellar. I don't even get sausage pizza all the time. I get it nearly every time I order from Papa Del's it's so good. 2. The crust. I always get the thin crust. It's not cracker thin. It is still crispy though and has never been soggy. 3. The sauce. It's not the best I've ever had but It's the best in town. I always get extra sauce and the amount is just right. That's it. It's easily the best in town and my first choice when ordering or picking up pizza."}
{"text":"So, here it goes:  I grew up with PD's.  In my JR SR HS years and College at UI, and until leaving CU in the early 2000s...this was a stellar product with amazing flavor. Over the years, returning to CU, always great.  Today's experience, the first in over a year and first at the \"Pizza Factory\"...huge disappointment.  What I ate today IS NOT the same product.  All of it:  Crust, Sauce, Cheese---not even close to the best product I've had in all my nationwide travels.  Meh.  WTH???  I'm done.  A shame.  One Star.  Boost to two stars because, even in this sorry state...it's still better than the soupy, undercooked, raw in the middle, flimsy \"Neapolitan\" crap the rest of the country has been embracing the last decade.  Sigh. Next time, if there is one, I'll stick to salad and garlic cheese bread."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Chicago style pizza but not Papa Del's. The crust is awfully thick and chewy and the fillings are not great. There's really nothing special about it. Papa Johns is wayyy better. Sorry . . . thumbs down."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had.  My favorite is the (extremely deep) deep dish sausage."}
{"text":"Menu does not proport what is listed! For example, five breadsticks plus 2 sauces is not $5.00. It is discretionary based what sauce is ordered."}
{"text":"Got here at 4:45 PM just ahead of the rush. Place is packed. It's now 6:20 PM and no pizza. As a fan of Papa Dels I know the wait for pizza is worth it. However the service is HORRIBLE..!! No refills on soda, have to go to the bar for drinks, garlic bites were VERY raw and cold in the center.! Dear Papa Dels, CU will not tolerate this service as you very well know. Get it together or close it down till you can. We cannot afford for there not to be a Papa Dels in town. Call it growing pains in f you like, but a slow kitchen is NO EXCUSE for poor wait staff and bar service..! I will wait for my pie and will probably wait a few weeks before coming back to give you the benefit of a doubt, but if service levels remain I'm DONE..! As I see it now I will blame the curse of this cursed building. BREAK THE CURSE..! PLEASE..!  UPDATE: it's now 6:40 PM and they just came by and asked if they could clear our table; plates, glasses, utensils, etc. and I replied NO, we haven't been served yet..! Still no pie.  UPDATE: 7:00 PM WE LEFT..!!! Couldn't even get the attention of our waitress to tell her, so we left. Here's my challenge to the manager. Call me 217-552-8617.! Thanks, Mike"}
{"text":"Papa Del's is great! Senior year I lived across the street from here, so obviously I frequented it! They have a great area inside to sit down and eat the pizza, watch TV and drink some good beer! The pizza is pretty big and tastes great!"}
{"text":"During our visit, we ordered their pan pizza.  It wasn't very busy but the wait was still 45 mins (I can't imagine what the time would be if it was during the busy hours).  The pizza was great, superb!  It was the thickest pizza I have ever had and can understand why the wait is what it is.  I live in the north suburbs of Chicago, and my favorite pan pizzas are Silo and Lou Malnati's.  It is hard to choose which I like more, but this was a nice change from my standard.  A side salad and one piece was plenty.  They offer pizza by the slice but then you won't have any leftovers.  That's no fun! They have their own parking in the back so you don't have to feed the meter."}
{"text":"After decades of Champaign-Urbana tradition, Papa Del's has kicked the can. When your manager is rude after messing up every stage from ordering to putting together the right order to delivery to trying to resolve what went wrong, that's a business that's no longer a part of its community. For years, I was the most loyal Papa Del's customer. We're never dealing with Papa Del's again."}
{"text":"All I have to say is: WOW.  Their pizza is sooooooooooo good. For sure ranks up there as one of the best stuffed pizzas EVER.   This place was a sheer Godsend in a town utterly devoid of quality food!! I was drowning miserably in the midst of constantly-disgusting and disappointing meals. I am sorry Champaign, but you have basically no good restaurants. All of the remaining eateries are either Asian restaurants and/or restaurants with chefs who don't know how to cook.  So thaaaank you Papa Del's for your scrumptious fare! Loved the super fresh veggie toppings and hefty (MASSIVE) pizza sizes.  Hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Why did I come here: Friends told me it was a must and was the best pizza in town.   Location: Good for college students living west of Campustown. A little far of a walk for lunch but possible.  Food: You go here for the pizza -Really good thick crust  -buttery/oily crust -good sauce  -A good variety of toppings  Atmosphere: A good place for groups but can be loud at times like on Fridays.  Advice: If you are on a time crunch, order ahead of time because it takes awhile for your order to arrive."}
{"text":"good place to meet your pals for a slice and it's easy on the wallet too! the food is good, but be forewarned, it sits like a brick -- don't plan on doing any strenuous activity after that meal. great pizza, great breadsticks, always good service."}
{"text":"Got one of their pizza's to take home since I was in town.  It was pretty good for deep dish pizza but I have had better.  I ordered a small onion and mushroom.  The crust was subpar and there was very little sauce, cheese, and toppings; it was mostly dough.  It does take a while to cook the pizza, like 45 minutes from when we called from the mall.  Whether it takes that long when you eat in I cannot say."}
{"text":"Listen up people, if you want the 5 star pizza, wait the hour and order a whole pizza for takeout. If you want the 1 star pizza, just go eat at the place and order by the slice. I promise you, there is a dramatic difference. This is why you're yelp users. You should KNOW these things!  This pizza, if ordered to-go, is the best pizza in the city, and probably that I've ever eaten. I now live in Chicago and I STILL crave this thing."}
{"text":"Papa Dell's serves the best Classic Chicago deep dish pizza in the area. It is a minimum of 45 minutes for a deep dish pie to cook but, it is sooo worth the wait. Order one with sausage you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Went out to this pizza joint with my swim team hoping for decent pizza. I was incredibly happy to find that the pizza was delicious. I ordered the signature pan pizza with pepperoni. It was everything you love about Chicago-style deep dish pizza down in Champaign.   Unfortunately, the meal takes a long time to be served. We sat down at 4:40 and didn't get out good until 5:45 rolled around.   Quickie review: Go here whenever you can! Food-wise Papa Del's is some of the best Champaign can offer."}
{"text":"I used to eat at Papa dels green street 2015 and before, and just got a chance to visit the new location at Neil when visiting campus.   The pizza is as good as ever, cheesy, hot, melt in your mouth. The crust is nice and crispy at the ends, the sauce sumptuous.  There's plenty of parking and the seating is more spacious, the bar is bigger as well. A little wine room makes a nice addition.  The only drawback is that it's no longer just a walk on green, but it's still not too far (half a mile) from the ARC."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in CU by a million years.  Sauce is savory, so much cheese.  The last time I had Papa Del's pizza I broke three forks."}
{"text":"Always my favorite pizza when in Champaign. Sausage is some of the best on pizza. And we really like the new location.  However if your looking for a quick meal this is not the place to go. I don't think their operations can keep up with the size of their new location. Last night we ordered pizza and were told it would be an hour. It was closer to 75 minutes. Garlic bread and Caesar salad....we were told it would take 45 minutes. Really.   Good food. Slow operations and service."}
