{"text":"Place was empty for a Friday night around 8, but we were starving and wanted to try something new.  I am not going to complain a whole lot about the food quality.  I ordered the Lasagna and it was quite good with a great bolognese sauce and garlic toast.  My wife had a burger that she devoured with good fries as well.  Serving size was average but adequate.  I would give food quality 3.5 stars.  However . . . sticker shock was an understatement.  Read the menu for yourself and make your decision, but this food was worth at most 60% of what they charge.  (It's Vegas . . . probably 40% in any given home town place.)  The service was spotty . . . the people there acted a little like they didn't know why they were there.  And the most memorable thing?  I think the sound system is being driven by an old CD player - as about every 90 seconds the cookie-cutter pop music would skip for 2-3 seconds like you used to experience when carrying your Sony Disc-man around.  At first I thought it was just a song or two, but it happened in every damn song they played.  Unless the prices come down - we will trudge our way to the Food Court for a quick bite, so I expect a new venue to fill this void sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"Terrible. We visited this place over Super Bowl weekend. It was after 2am, so there weren't many other options, but we figured it was at Caesars so it couldn't be so bad. The place looked nice enough, so we got ourselves a table.   First, the prices our outrageous. $44 for a steak and some fries. $18 for some eggs and bacon. $16 for a Chinese chicken salad, or a Caesar.   I probably would have gotten over the price if the quality of the food matched the tag. Unfortunately, it didn't. There were only a few things to choose from, but my husband got a couple of grilled cheese sandwiches and I got the Chinese chicken salad. My salad was fine. Nothing to write home about, but edible. The sandwiches, however, left a lot to be desired. It's really not that hard to mess up a grilled cheese, but when these arrived we were particular shocked to see they were made with American cheese (not cheddar), and the bread might as well have been Wonder-bread. For an $18 sandwich, we definitely expected some good cheddar and thick sliced sourdough. Also, his fries were cold and dry, like they had been sitting underneath the warmer for a couple of hours.   Our server didn't gain any points either. From the start, we felt overlooked. We aren't a couple who goes all out when they go to Vegas. I don't know how so many can walk the Strip in 5-inch heels all night. We're a t-shirt and jeans kind of couple. I couldn't help but notice that most of the other guests were in suits and dresses. You know, they looked like they had $$. Well, our server was attentive to those guests, while we got the cold shoulder. He took our order, but our food was delivered by another server/runner, and we had to run him down for the check. He didn't check on us once and certainly wasn't helpful.   Big mistake. My husband is the most generous guy you'll ever meet. I was a waitress for 10 years, and even I tell him he tips too much, often 40% for service that was just okay. This was the first time that he left a \"standard\" tip, which was about 18%.   You may have a completely different experience if you visit this place during normal restaurant hours, but for late night it was hugely disappointing."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  The food is always perfect and the service is unmatched.  The can accommodate any patron.  Don't be fooled that it is too fancy...as it is not stuffy at all.  Try the Friday Night Grill too---great value."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was because of how eerily quiet it was and the price relative to portion size. We were a party of four and there was only one other party which happened to be a family sitting across the room..which I found strange for a Saturday evening. I ordered the Roasted Organic Chicken and it happened to be quite tasty and pretty good on price. I can't say the same about the Steak Au Poivre, however."}
{"text":"Waiter was nice, service sucks..really expensive. The only reason I ate here was cause I got to Vegas Late Thursday night and everything on the strip where I wanted to eat was closed by 11 or 12..so I didn't feel like walking all over to find something and I was just really hungry at the time. I wasn't really expecting this place to Charge $67 for two burgers and a drink each for me and my girlfriend, the food wasn't bad or anything, but definitely NOT worth $67..I assumed a 24 hour restaurant would've been an okay priced place for all the travelers and drunk people to grab a quick bite. Like I said earlier the waiter was cool and all but the service was bad and place is just way to over priced..if you're willing to spend that type of money for the same food you can get somewhere else for only 30/40 bucks then go for it!"}
{"text":"Situated about 2 blocks from my office and directly next to a Starbucks means I'm here for lunch or a bite after work several times a month.  Bistro 24 is yet to disappoint.   The service is always stellar, but it's the Ritz, so it ought to be.  The food is all quite good.  It's not the most romantic or fanciest dining room... There are more fun & eclectic places to take a date but is a great place to take a client or colleague for a bite.  i think of the Bistro as more of a lunch place than a dinner spot, but it certainly goes either way.   If you are looking to try the Bistro but are on a bit of a budget, i would try one of these two little tips: 1.  Check out Friday Night Grill... its about 35 per person and all you can eat.  They have steak freshly cooked on the grill outside and a variety of sushi and salads inside.  The desert table is decadent.  For less than you'd spend on a steak next door at Morton's, you'll get a ton of high quality delicious food. 2.  Happy Hour is at 5pm.  Their appetizers and many drinks (including draft beer) are half off.  Get a Firestone Pale Ale or Double Brown Ale for just $3.  One of my favorite appetizers is the Ratatouille Pizza. (Only $7 during happy hour!). It's delicious and eats like a meal.    Bon appetit"}
{"text":"Bistro 24 is a nice, romantic restaurant in the Ritz Carlton.  The decor and service is spectacular; but the food, on the other hand, could still use some work.  We had a prix fixe menu, consisting of the farmer's market salad, short rib or salmon entree, and a peanut butter ice cream chocolate cake or the carrot cake with cheesecake topping.  I think our farmer's market salad was missing the dressing or seasoning.  There was nothing flavorful or tasty in that dish. Both the entrees were delicious. The salmon had a crusty finish, cooked to perfection over creamy polenta and the short ribs were tender, melt in your mouth, with the perfect mashed potato partner.  The desserts were average, but too sweet for me, and I had a pretty big sweet tooth.  The carrot cake cheesecake dessert was moist and the cheesecake topping was good.  The chocolate cake was very dense and the peanut butter ice cream tasted like straight peanut butter and sugar.  What was awesome about this restaurant is the executive chef came out to each table after the entrees were served to talk to his guests...now talk about service!    Overall: Food alright but would not go back.  Prices: Expensive."}
{"text":"The Ahi Tuna entree here is the best in town.  It is consistently a sushi grade cut, unlike many other places that claim to serve sushi grade.  The service is consistently top notch as well.  It is expensive, but worth the price!"}
{"text":"the absolute best pancakes i've tasted anywhere in the world! Plus. Somehow they have perfected the art of making crisp bacon with no grease! Thei order of pancakes is enough for 2 people. And their fresh squeezed orange juice is the best. Plus...all I need to do is walk out the front door of my building when I get up and they are next door. So I image that makes everything tase better when I'm feeling lazy in the morning!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late night snack/early morning breakfast.   Seated in a section for 25 minutes until they realized they didn't even have a waitress in the section & then asked to relocate to another section. Bus boy seemed more concerned than anyone else in the entire place for the wait to include management.   Very limited menu. Ordered the pancake stack & turkey club sandwich. French fries were ice cold, toast on bread was hard as a rock & pancakes were too heavy. One orange juice & a flat sprite later we were over $60 in the hole. I work hard for my money and sincerely hate wasting it. Will never return, nor recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great tasting food.  What more could you ask for?  A bit pricey, but that is to be expected with the level of quality.  The wait staff will cater to your every need and will make sure your lunch or dinner is to your liking.    I came here for lunch on a business lunch and it was everything I expected.  I had the chicken caesar salad and it was great.    If you are looking for a place to meet up after work or to have a power lunch, I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here for birthday. The service was impeccable,as was the entire restaurant. The food was very good, just left me wishing there was more. I had a deal for their farm to table menu option, and it was pretty nicely priced. All in all a great experience"}
{"text":"During my 5 nights stay at Ritz,  I went to  Bistro 24 for breakfast my first morning.  I experienced very slow service for Ritz standards.  I had to wait a while for someone to wait on.  It was not even busy.  For the next 4 days, I just walked across the street to Starbucks."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant located inside of the Ritz Carlton. We were seated by a gracious and friendly hostess and waited for our two friends to arrive. We were given coffee and water and were able to peruse the menu. When our friends arrived, we ordered our breakfast. I got bacon, eggs, potatoes and wheat toast. The toast was perfect, the bacon was perfectly cooked, the eggs were well done and not running (just the way I like) and the potato - oh my! I could have eaten 5 more! It was like sour cream and chives mashed potatoes smooshed in to a perfectly round patty and then deep fried until the entire exterior was crisp. Just amazing!"}
{"text":"Doing meetings at the Ritz so have ended up in the bar and restaurant (Bistro 24). What a pleasant surprise - especially on a Friday night. They have their Grill Night buffet and it is soooo worth it.   Appetizer buffet includes Blue Point oysters, lobster bites, fabulous seared tuna with wasabi cream, cute filet mignon bites, shrimp, duck and cheese fun stuff..etc.  Sushi stand. Enough said.  Outdoors is the grill....filet mignon, lamb chops, organic salmon, grilled shrimp....mashed potatoes...grilled greens.....  The Dessert stand....decadent.  Wine list...va bene!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the service nice, but if I want to sit next to stable of overweight folks in T-shirt, flip flops , oversized shorts with wedgie and all, I would go to Hooters. Please Ritz Carlton get a dress code."}
{"text":"It's tradition for my family to spend Christmas Eve at the Ritz Carelton and have dinner at Bistro 24.  The food is always excellent and the service top notch.  The hotel is elegantly adorned with holiday garland and lights with a tastefully decorated tree that immediately grabs your attention upon entering the lobby.  The hotel is a very simple and tasteful way to enjoy the holiday season."}
{"text":"I went here for a ladies lunch.   The service was great and the hotel is beautiful with holiday decor.  I ordered the cob salad and it was really good and filling.  Very nice and tons of turkey chunks in the salad.  I also had a glass of Craggy Range Sauvignon Blanc that was very nice.  It was not a cheap lunch but it was a very good lunch."}
{"text":"This restaurant is unbelievable from start to finish. When we arrived there was a fabulous pianist playing in the lobby,so we had cocktails. We were then seated in the beautiful restaurant and warmlky greeted by Alex our terrific waiter. The food was beautifully presented and delicious. We had scallops and steak. Even the coffee and desert was fabulous,brownie and espresso gelato. The price was very inexpensive for this kind of an experience. This must be the best kept secret in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went to the Ritz last night for dinner.  I will tell you we didn't choose this one first but all the places we wanted to try were fully booked till 9pm (way to late for new parents).  So I open tabled it, and, despite reading poor reviews in the past, I booked it.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.  The atmosphere is not as nice as I thought it should be but the service was impeccable.  We opted for the restaurant week menu and it was spectacular.  I started with some marvelous mushroomy raviolis which were perfectly al dente and over some garlicy spinach.  Yum!  Then for the best part....the apricot leg of lamb.  I have never been a lamb fan but decided to branch out and am so glad I did.  It was so tender it fell off the bone and melted in your mouth.  I loved the apricot couscous as well.  The finale was the coconut pineapple creme brulee and, although it wasn't prepared on the spot, it made it to my top three of all time.  And it was giant!  My husband got the filet which was perfectly rare as he requested.  His starter was a caprese with italian cheese and was very good.  His dessert was not so great, a chocolate goat cake....some goat cheese thing which we could only take one bite of before calling it quits.  Overall, we had a really nice dinner and it wasn't too pricey, although I can see why all the reviews.  Of course, you shouldn't head to the Ritz if you don't want to drop some cash on dinner.  The normal menu is small, but I am from the school of thought to do less items on the menu and make them perfect.  The Ritz did that so I had to write this review to vendicate them."}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly service and a beautiful restaurant located in the Ritz-Carlton.  This restaurant has a great menu selection.  The Steak Au Poivre is an excellent classic!  There is live music on Saturday evenings in the lobby with an amazing pianist, Nicole Pesce and Jeffrey Hattrick.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Wait Staff excellent. Food just ok. Could be much,much better/tastier. For such a local restaurant it could be your neighborhood \"go-to\".  Gail Z"}
{"text":"Bistro 24 has really nice food with an excellent and interesting bread assortment. Every time I have been there, whether while working or not, I have had excellent service. I must confess, one day at lunch I asked what was going to be that night's dessert.  Not only did the server tell us, but he brought us one. It was a fresh out of the oven chocolate macaroons that wasn't going on the menu until evening. It melted in my mouth.It is service and food like that which keep bringing me back."}
{"text":"Bistro 24 is the restaurant inside the Ritz Hotel.  Many people seem to love this restaurant, but the selection on the lunch menu is weak.  A large portion of the food they cook is very bland.  If you are going to eat here, a salad may be the way to go as they are very good.  Honestly, it would be hard to say that you could find better service and that is expected when you are at the Ritz.  Certainly the friendly staff is the highlight of Bistro 24.  I would not recommend eating here when there are so many better options just across the street."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for dinner and once for lunch and can't believe I have never written a review.  The restaurant has a French bistro feel to it, great service as you would expect from a Ritz Carlton and surprisingly good food.  I hear they will be renovating the hotel and I assume the restaurant, so I'll be interested to see what they do with the place post-renovation."}
{"text":"This place holds true to the formula that portion size is inversely proportional to the price.  For a hotel restaurant there is a surprising amount of flavor in their dishes.  The customer service is exemplary and the menu also has some rotating items.   I went here often for business lunches and they were always to immediately accommodate us regardless of group size. Menu items could also be customized to your wishes, ie no bacon, or add cheese.  I usually ordered the salmon dish, to their credit they did find new and entertaining way to present a fairly common fish.  One of my favorites was with a orzo pasta with a light cream sauce.   For more commons foods it is entertaining to see the mini sized sized ketchup and mustard bottles that they serve with each plate.  The real reasons to come here is for the service, ambiance and to impress clients and or dates."}
{"text":"They have won the 2011 award from Wine Spectator for excellence and besides the wine list offer several different wine flights that go from starter wines to rich chewy long lasting in four generous portions that adds to the enjoyment of dinning.  The appetizer special was prosciutto wrapped white asparagus ( grilled ) , buffalo mozzarella , heirloom tomatoes topped with an over easy quail egg that was topped with a shave of black truffle surrounded by truffle vinaigrette. This was pretty much as good as it gets. I saw black specs in the vinaigrette and thought they were pepper but to my surprise they were pieces of black truffle so I was impressed that the chef didn't use cheap truffle oil and used real truffles. The buffalo cheese has so much more going on with it than regular mozzarella and also just melts in your mouth in a pleasurable way. The prosciutto used was high end. I also liked that Chef Stephen Toevs came out and asked us how we liked it.  I ordered the special, sole topped with fennel salad surrounded by grain mustard beurre blanc and whipped not spicy jalapeño potatoes. I wasn't sure if these taste would work together but they did and were an incredible experience.  My husband had the prime strip steak au poivre. This steak was as good as strip steak can be but it came with fries and onion straws. The the fries and onion straws were good but not as exciting as the very good prime meat and are part of the reason this wasn't a five star review. I do note the sides of fries and onions were included in the modest price for this kind of steak. (Prime strip steak runs approx $49.00 lb at AJs)  We have been up to this point been receiving the very best over the top service from our waiter Grant ( who really was a joy ). But at this point the two waiters on got slammed and I counted our waiter running around with at least seven tables  ( some were outside on the patio ) He had help but wasn't able to ask us how are meals were ( although they were great )   We wanted to order dessert since the meals were very good and Grant did make the trip to clear our plates and give dessert menus. We don't drink coffee but I do think we should have been asked if we wanted some with the hazelnut bar we ordered but I know that was due to the workload our waiter was experiencing . I'm not being mean or picky but in high end dining you are paying for everything great.  Over all the food is reasonably priced for high end. The specials were OUTSTANDING. I think the menu is slightly dated and the dessert we tried was good but is not on the level of the really great meals. I also used my preferred dining card and received one meal for free.  I would love to try more of Chef Toevs specials. I got the impression he is a masterful and Creative Chef."}
{"text":"Food here was great! We had a light supper, salads for both of us, but the price was perfect for what we had and the service was good. It felt a little odd that the restaurant was so big and so empty, despite it being a Friday night. Also, the lighting in our area kept flickering. Very obviously so, to the point that we were laughing over it and trying to figure out what was causing it. Not a bad visit, but their maintenance needs to seriously look over their lighting."}
{"text":"Impeccable service, but what else would you expect at the Ritz-Carlton?! Stopped in for a late night dessert with the boy after a sad, failed attempt to make homemade pizza. They were happy to accommodate us even though it was pretty close to closing time. It was a gorgeous evening so we got a table outside, what an adorable Parisian patio! Our server was very professional and sweet, offering tons of variations of lattes and cappuccinos that she could whip up for me after I mentioned craving coffee! I ordered the vanilla creme brulee w. mixed berries on top & he got chocolate cake. Both were divine and definitely made us forget about all of the trauma that our taste buds had suffered!"}
{"text":"A ex boyfriend took me there for Valentine's Day and it was amazing.  The restaurant had nothing to do with the ex part. :-)  They created a tasting menu that increased in complexity and flavor with every dish.  I never thought I would taste foie gras but it was amazing.  Our appetizer was lobster and the soup was artichoke.  Again something I would've passed up on a regular menu and the mushroom brioche was over the top with texture.  My boyfriend commented that it tasted like meat and enjoyed it very much.  The beef tenderloin was my main entree and it was cooked to perfection.    Our server was attentive and was an excellent server.  It was definitely romantic and was worth the drive and money for the special day."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 20 for a work lunch.  Due to time constraints we ordered our lunches ahead.  I ordered the chicken con-fit but they change the item out.  They emailed our person that was setting up the lunch and notify me that they have grilled turkey breast served with butternut squash puree, brussel sprouts with crispy bacon, and a cranberry relish.  They sounded deli-sh, so I was OK with the change.  Boy, the change was welcome when I had my first taste.  OMG, everything was SO SO SO GOOD.  The service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here just before 1am early Monday morning (Sunday night) as we were in the area and there weren't too many other nearby dining options. We definitely should have been less lazy and gone somewhere better.  The menu seemed pretty meh, so I ordered the \"guava BBQ\" ribs ($34) which as listed on the menu come with fries and slaw. First off, the portion is tiny - just 5 ribs not cut very well, so it was really more like 4 ribs. The ribs themselves were just OK; they tasted like typical ribs you'd get from a typical chain restaurant. I honestly couldn't taste any guava. Unfortunately, the fries were so salty to the point I couldn't eat more than a few - and as far as the slaw, it was literally one bite. It came in a tiny container the same size as the ketchup for my fries. I think my friends were happier with their food (not that that's saying much), but it was all definitely just typical cafe offerings.  Service was not good - I didn't get my water or soda refilled even once, not even after asking. My place setting was also missing a napkin, and again, I had to ask two busboys and then my waiter before I finally got one. After finishing my ribs, I asked for wet naps. The server brought me a napkin soaked in hot water, but then took my other napkln. Apparently diners here are not allowed more than one napkin, even when they are lucky enough to get one at all in the first place.  I don't expect much value from a 24 hour cafe in a strip casino, but $34 for 5 ribs, bad fries, nearly nonexistent slaw, and iffy service? I'll definitely pass."}
{"text":"Service was great, as was expected for a restaurant located in Ritz Carlton.  Food was pretty good.  Dessert was dissappointing.  My cake was still partly frozen and my fiancee's was okay.  They both tasted like something you get outta the grocer's freezer.  Was palatable, but not what you expect at Ritz.    The ambiance and service is what kept me from giving it 3 stars.  Overheard the waitress talk about Friday Night grill, so will try that someday soon, and will update according to my experience then."}
{"text":"They do it right here. I never order what is on the menu, because I am somewhat picky and like my own thing. Every time I come here, I order what I want and they nail it. Last time I ordered a Caesar salad with salmon on top and a side of steamed broccoli. The salmon was some of the best I've ever had! Another favorite of mine here are the mashed potatoes (pomme purée) as they call it. The staff is superb, they go above and beyond for you and make your experience a pleasurable one. It's not a cheap meal but a good meal for sure."}
{"text":"Hosted clients for dinner on Wednesday.  Restaurant was empty.  When the food came I realized why.  I ordered the steak au poivre medium rare.  It came out medium well.  The meat was tough and the sauce was beyond bad.    Why 2 stars?  The service.  Extremely friendly and prompt but they had to realize the badness of the food they were serving.  Hate to write bad reviews for such nice people but this is a food review site and I call them like I see them."}
{"text":"Bistro 24 is located inside the Ritz Carlton.  I am not one for eating at the hotel, but since we were crunched for time, we didn't have much choice.  I had the southwest chicken sandwich, which was very good but messy, which surprised me given the fact that they cater to a business clientele. My colleague had a salmon ceasar salad, which she reported was okay.  Our table was quite comfy and cozy (we were given a corner booth with a pillow between us for leisurely leaning).  There was a group of older ladies actually having a tea party (I didn't know this still happened) in the restaurant, which was quite entertaining to watch."}
{"text":"We had the afternoon free so the other wives and I were walking the strip, we ducked into Ceaser's and found Bistro 24 right away. Since none of us had eaten there before, we decided to eat there.  Large plates and serving utensils were whimsical decor, and the tables were white linen table cloths, the service was delightful.  My friends ordered a Grilled cheese sandwich on garlic bread with fries - which sounded decadent. And I'm assured it was.   A salad with chicken topping it, Corrin said that it was light and crisp, that the dressing that she asked for on the side, had been served on it, which wasn't really an issue.   I ordered the chicken salad sandwich, with a side salad. The chicken salad was flavored with curry spices, I didn't know this when I ordered it, but when I bit into it, it was abundantly clear. I wasn't sure how I would react.. it was REALLY good. I LOVED it.   Over all, I'd eat here again, if I could."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for our Valentines day dinner, and I was impressed! Our reservation was for 8:30, but they were running a little behind so we sat the bar for some champagne. The hotel itself is gorgeous! And the restaurant did the place justice! It was gorgeous as well! They had the piano playing songs from way back in caveman ages to 2013 music. That was refreshing! And the decor was beautiful. The only recommendation I have is dimming the lights a little more.   We finally got seated and our waitress, whom was lovely,gave us the valentines day dinner menu which consisted of 4 courses, dessert, and intermezzo(sp). Course 1: oyster with caviar...AMAZING!! Course 2: lobster pieces with some kind of creamy white sauce...magnificent!! It was so tender and flavorful! Course 3: Cauliflower soup....best soup I have ever had! I must learn to make this at home!! It was so creamy and rich!! Intermezzo: orange sorbet...delicious! Can't ever go wrong with orange sorbet.  Course 4: porter house steak for 2....it wasn't as great as I imagined it to be, but I also like my steak medium rare an we got this steak as medium well. The seasonings were just right.  Dessert: guava ice cream which was very tart and tasty and I don't even like guava. Also spongy cake pieces with apricot and orange marmalades which was my favorit, and this chocolate mousse cake! It was all so good!   It was a lovely dinner! The staff was amazing! The place was amazing! Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and we didn't want to leave.  The food was amazing and the staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and eager to take care of the customers. The wife wants to to have a weekend get away at the hotel just so we can try more items."}
{"text":"If you have the money, or a company card, then Bistro 24 could be a nice place to dine for lunch or dinner.  But if the meal's on your dime, you'll probably want to head somewhere else.  Bistro 24 is ritzy.  It is in the Ritz Carlton after all.  You won't find an entree for dinner under $20, and they go up to $40 I believe.  A tad out of my price range.  And when I say a tad, I mean totally and completely out of my price range.  Thankfully, I was being treated to lunch by a client, so I ordered without fear.  We had grilled asparagus and french onion soup for an appetizer and I had an eleven dollar caesar salad for my meal.  They're definitely a meat-y place, and I found myself in a sea of lamb chops, pork and veal, so the salad was one of my only options.  The food was good, but not fabulous or anything.  The service would be the best thing about the place if you ask me. They're impeccable. If you drop your napkin, I swear they swoop down from the ceiling to bring you another one before you can count to one."}
{"text":"I may be a bit biased, as we got married at the Ritz Carlton Phoenix, but we went to Bistro 24 for our anniversary dinner a year later, and had an amazing time. The atmosphere is absolutely lovely and the service is top notch.  We enjoyed the warm bread served to the table as well as the *Caesar Salad* which we shared as a starter. My husband had a *Chicken* dish and he thought that it was cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  I had a *Veggie Burger* which was absolutely delicious. It was a housemade patty with a chutney of some sort on top of it and caramelized onion. It was delightful. The french fries were perfectly cooked and spiced! We can't wait to go back again soon :)"}
{"text":"This place is inside the Ritz Carlton so it better be good, and it is.  First off it is beautiful.  This is not some overrated hipster joint.  This is the real deal.  Excellent food, excellent service and a great atmosphere.  And the food is not as expensive as many other places with less quality. Two different steak options for less than $40!  Many steak joints charge around $50 just for the piece of meat.  The sides will set you back another $6 or more.   Will have to say that glasses of wine are not cheap but money can be saved by ordering by the bottle.  The portions are not huge but fully adequate.    Now for the specifics.  We had the baked beet salad, see picture.  It was great and the presentation was beautiful.  The ahi tuna was great as well.  The lamb tenderloin was one of the best lamb dishes I've had.  One may have been better, on the SS. Norway. I told our waiter, Alex this and he had the chef come to our table to meet us.  He even gave me a copy of the recipe!  I also told Alex I cook for a hobby.    Alex was very personable.  He made friends with us and the table near us too.  He never was a bother and everybody seemed to enjoy being served by him and his conversation.  This is not a stuffy place.  The wait staff wear dinner jackets but the customers can wear jeans with a nice shirt.    There was also live piano music from the lounge right outside the Bistro. This is a place you will want to come to again and the prices will allow you to come more often than for that special, once in a great while, special event.  Hey boys and girls, what a great way to spoil your date without breaking the bank!  Just don't get crazy on the drinks!"}
{"text":"Bistro 24 is a nice spot to have a nice upscale dinner.  I had a groupon for a meal for two which was a terrific deal we saved over $60 off our bill.  For the first course was a salad with a sherry vinaigrette which was ok.  Next for entree I had the short ribs which were cooked perfectly they came with horseradish mashed potatoes which I thought were a bit too strong all I tasted was horseradish.  For dessert I had an amazing chocolate peanut butter cake and it was a great way to end the meal.   I enjoyed Bistro 24 and if they have a groupon again I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. The food is quite good, although I'm not much into the fancy foods. They used to do a crepe buffet at their Sunday brunch which I loved (not sure if they do it anymore). But overall, the experience and food here is pretty great. Nice to sit out on the patio as well."}
{"text":"Central is now Bistro 24.  Same location but new owners as the previous restaurant went bankrupt.  There is no signage currently that identifies it as Bistro 24.  Breakfast is served til 11 am and lunch til 4.  After Christmas, Bistro 24 will reopen with many of the same people and a revamped menu.  The restaurant will then be open 24 hours a day.  The burger and fish and chips make great lunchtime options.  We had the Club sandwich and the grilled cheese.  Sandwiches come with the option of a salad, cole slaw or fries.  The bar is great for picking some cocktails on your way back to the room or a bottle of champagne to celebrate your winnings.  A late night snack and dessert is also the most popular option after a not of  clubbing and drinking.     Centrally located across from the Caesars checkin. Bypass the Starbucks and head over for breakfast and don't miss the stuffed French Toast, their signature dish.  Because of its location, you cant miss this spot and it will be a great central place to meet away from the casino."}
{"text":"This review is for Afternoon Tea with Jeffrey. Maybe I've reviewed it before... can't remember, can't find it. But here goes ... it was magical. I love that they change up the tidbits every so often to keep things fresh and new. The tea savories are twists on the old faves - salmon on a mini-blini, curried egg salad in tiny egg cups, and walnut chicken salad in a teeny-tiny bread box. The scones are buttery-rich and flavorful, especially slathered with lemon curd, raspberry jam, and Devonshire cream. Petit fours are marvelous - chocolate cake with ganache, vanilla-lavender cake, raspberry macaron with dark chocolate filling, and more. The service is incredibly attentive and Jeffrey is the ultimate host. Hurry on in before the Ritz changes hands though. It's a delightful way to spend an afternoon."}
