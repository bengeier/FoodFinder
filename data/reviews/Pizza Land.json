{"text":"My favorite pizza n wings spot. Very nice owners and staff. Very clean. Lots of space to sit. So much vatiety of food to chose from. Steak plate and tawook plate are awesome too. Anytime theres a big game i come here for my pizza n wings...sooo fresh!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible at the counter. Will not be back again. The kid even got snotty on the phone when I called to voice my concern and proceeded to say you got your  food at the end of the day didn't you. Long story short I simply asked him why somebody was allowed to walk by numerous people waiting in line to get his items. We all wanted to order or pick up our food. If the kid was more soft and more receptive it would have been nice."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite pizza place in toronto. Best food ever. I would recommend it to everyone. Everyone should try their panzerottos..they were perfect.  10/10"}
{"text":"Pizza land pizza... I find it tastes better a day old. 

Service ..too slow... 25 -30 minute wait...when u got hungry kids it seems like a decade . 
.food great... shish taouk delicious. .. panzerroto good too. Slightly over priced I think . 

Wash stations  is a nice idea to it... but the dryer is so damn close to the sink it's kinda awkward . 

Overall really nice ... atmosphere is good too ."}
{"text":"For family outting I love this place, foods great (must try pizza and wings). Kids love it with all the different food options. Cashier a bit grumpy but with all the goods at this place that could be ignored. Place clean and food service time is ok."}
{"text":"Food is good, authentic halal, however i rather not dine in. The owner or the lady in the back always kinda yelling at her employees. Beside that yummy pizza and wings. Definitely for take out.. and wish they had delivery."}
{"text":"Pizza land has always been my favourite spot. Love their shish tawouk & burgers! The vibe is also super cozy. Almost all of my experiences here have been amazing, but recently I kind of had an off one.

We bought food for take out and then decided to sit down. Yes, there is a sign stating that once you order take out you cannot dine in. We did not see this sign. Once my group sat down and we started eating we were kicked out. It was a really awkward and embarrassing moment. Maybe you should just explain the situation to your customers and let them finish eating instead of telling them to leave while they're munching down on a sandwich. Aside from that one day, it's really great."}
{"text":"Took two stars away from this joint just because they're service is so disappointing. I've been here 6 times over the last few years, some days busy, some days I'm the only client waiting to be served. Yesterday in particular there was only one person in the restaurant and I had 3 workers walk past me and 5 minutes pass before I was acknowledged. After dining here on several occasions, I can tell that it's a common thing and I'm not the only one who experiences that. 

Anyway, the reason I keep coming back is for the shish tawook! It's so delicious. The chicken is always tender and juicy. The right amount of toppings and it doesn't fall apart like other places I've tried. It does take a while to make but totally worth the wait. A lot of great halal options for \"American food\" as well. They're pizza is to die for and they serve the same fries as McDonald's. 

I'll probably start ordering my food ahead of time to beat the wait."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in the GTA.  their food quality is always good."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch,will not be returning. 8 wings, small fries and a drink was about $12. Price was OK, the food was not. As you can see from the picture,you get a very small portion of fries for about $3. Some the wings have sauce on them, others not so much. The over all quality of the food was OK, but it went thru me pretty quick as I was looking for a bathroom 30-40 minutes latter. Also I could hear members of the staff/family arguing with each other, not a good thing to do in front of customers."}
{"text":"Family run place so service is a bit slow, it took about 20 minutes on a Thursday night to get my order.

Cheap food - I got a pan size pizza for $5!!
 
Everything ordered was delicious and greasy - chicken burger, panzo and pan pizza. Just wish they gave steel knife and fork for the panzo because the plastic ones just don't cut it (pun intended). 

Fin."}
{"text":"Pizzaland is a great little family restaurant with a great selection of items with that homemade taste. The chicken poutine and pizza are my go to items on the menu. Place has gotten better in appearance over the years but they're rough around the edges when it comes to customer service. For some reason they don't allow you to order on the phone and eat there. Very stupid policy. Once saw a man pick up a phone order and decided to have a slice there (restaurant not busy at all) and the lady that's always yelling gave him a (verbal) beating like she was Floyd Mayweather!"}
{"text":"Always always always loved this place. Food consistent prices great. Service wonderful. Place clean and really changed and done up nicely. Definitely recommend it. My favourite. Chicken wings, while chicken with garlic sauce. Lots of it :). Mexican pizza.  Fries. BBQ wings and hot wings :)
Doesn't open Tuesday's.  Wish it did.  Other then that nothing negative to say."}
{"text":"I think this is a great halal option and a great place to bring families. 

It's walk up service but I thought that was fine. Pretty typical pizza and wings, but three stars because I liked the food.  I thought their 'pepperoni' (made with beef) tasted like regular pepperoni so that was cool, and I liked the wings we got (honey garlic). 

Overall good experience and I'd go back with family as it's a good halal option."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for a quick lunch. Food was okay, nothing special. The chicken was dry, fries were good. The pizza was alright. What made me give this place just one star is the service, and atmosphere. We wanted to change one of our orders because we weren't clearly explained what exactly was in it and when we went to tell the cashier (who was a teenager btw) it turned into a big fuss about how we should have known before and the \"chef\" started yelling from the back. Then the mother came and started helping the cashier, who is her son (this is a family-run restaurant) and they started arguing back and forth in Arabic. Seriously, while we were waiting?Anyway, this was just the rudest thing ever and we did end up paying the difference and changing our order, but the wait was like 20 minutes. Very slow service. And on top of that, the place is cold, the tables aren't cleaned properly. Oh and the area/decor isn't great either. I won't be returning, maybe for takeout if I'm truly desperate."}
{"text":"- I love the pizza and food and garlic sauce .. we get a party size usually with chicken and ground beef and jalpenos ..
- price is not great, everything is over priced for the actually joint .. the only novelty is that they are halal
- service is terrible ..
- the restaurant was super cold, and our food got so cold in a matter of minutes .. we were not even allowed to take our food in to go boxes like we originally asked ..
- renovations were useless and as you have to flag down someone twice to clean your table .."}
{"text":"A lot of people told me to come check this place out and as I was in the area I decided to give it a try.  The decor and service were both really great. I was surprised about how nice it looked from the inside considered all the other shops in the area don't look very inviting for sit downs.

I ordered a steak on a bun combo and it was pretty meh to be honest. There wasn't much to it , it wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either. Maybe It was best for me to order a pizza as the steak isn't their specialty. I found the steak to be a bit rubbery and mostly just tasted the bread. I feel that this place was a bit overhyped and tbh the worst thing was the parking lot of the plaza it's located in. My god that lot is such a mess, enough for me to not want to come back."}
{"text":"Pizzaland Halal restaurant provides outstanding customer service. Their newly renovated restaurant looks amazing.  Their food menu is absolutely affordable and the best part of Pizzaland Halal is their chicken wings, Best in Toronto and I highly recommend going there to try it out!"}
{"text":"The food used to be good. Now it's consistently bad. Unfortunately the service is bad too. Not sure if it's all the staff but whomever it is that answer the phone (if they answer at all) and maybe the owners kids at the counter, but it also consistently bad. Only reason to give it any stars is the location is convenient."}
{"text":"Best Wings!! We got the hot wings - they were so fresh and crispy, Will definitely be coming back.

Also got the burger and chicken breast sandwich - amazing! 
THe pizza is also great, super cheesy and well cooked."}
{"text":"I have been goign to this place aswell from the first year it opened and they have come along way. Although they seemed alot nicer when they werent so busy. Altough me and my buddies joke about this place because at times the workers/owners are screaming at each other etc...

But the food is really good, and very reasonablly priced. So i have always gone back

Their homeburger is my favorite, although if your really make sure you tell them if there is something you dont want on the burger, or else you might still get it on there. 

Sish- Tawook - really good
Wings - amazing but at times they are really small wings.
Panazarotti- i think this is the only place that makes an amazing halal deepfried panzarotti in the city. 

And if your getting friesdont forget to get their garlic dip, its good as well.


Damn im so hungry, and stupid, im wiritng food reviews with a fast in ramadhan."}
{"text":"Ignorant people. Cashier sucks! Miserable cashier that never smiles. Who hired this guy!!"}
{"text":"After debating with my friends (who LOVE pizza land) I decided to give this place a second chance. We ordered delivery this time and I got the shish tawook and it was DELICIOUS. It's basically like a shawarma wrap but the meat is so much tastier! It's been a while since I've had a wrap that was this good

Honestly I really wasn't expecting to have something this good from pizza land but I'm glad I gave them another chance :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza ! Very soft and crunchy and I like their garlic sauce too. The place is nice and small."}
{"text":"This place has held its own for a long time in the world of Pizzas and Wings. Many stores along side Lawrence Ave. have popped up but nothing comes close in comparison to Pizza Land. 

Their pizza and wings are amazing. The use of cheese and the sauce on wings is in abundance. 

Sheesh Tawook Chicken is always a hit with the family as they can come in a wrap or alone to eat. Their Garlic sauce is a tasty one. 

Recently, they have upgraded and renovated their store. Now, it compares to a good dining location where you can take a date or host a party."}
{"text":"Pizzaland Halal was recommended by my good friend Moez.  He told me that it's right beside Naan & Kabob and that I should try it out, especially the Shish Taouk, Homeburger, Pizza and Chicken Wings.

I decided to take my co-worker Mariam out for lunch on Thursday as she was leaving our department to go downtown for her new job.  She is Muslim so this was a perfect place for her to get some eats.

I checked out their website and I was thoroughly impressed.  There were full colour pictures of the food, the menu had all the combos and prices listed.  There is also an option to order online.  I called the place directly to put in the order for take-out.  The lady on the other line took my order but there was definitely a language barrier.  I did have to repeat myself a few times and ensure the order was correct which was not a big deal.  When you go to eat ethnic, it's part of the territory.  She told me that it would take 15 minutes.

I went to pick up the food and was really excited.  When I got in, there was no line-up... yes!  The lady looked at me from the back and came to the front.  I paid by credit card which was cool because I didn't have cash on me.  I noticed that their phones were ringing off the hook.

We got back to the lunch room back at work and \"went to town\".  The food I ordered was a Shish Taouk sandwich wrap.  I never had Shish Taouk before so I couldn't wait to try it.  Opened the bag, wow, so greasy good.  I bit into the wrap and immediately I thought, real barbecue flavour.  A few bites in... it was just decent dry BBQ chicken chunks with lettuce, tomato and it was not anything special.  But then, the shish taouk sauce kicked in halfway and I found myself loving it with each bite.  Very flavourful and delicious it was.  I actually could not get enough of it.  Sure, the wrap itself kind of exploded (see picture) but I gobbled it up happy and truly satisfied.

Most definitely I will return to this place and check out other things to order from the menu.  It was a hit for me and hope it will be for you too!"}
{"text":"Came with a group of friends after having this place highly recommended. Food ranged is average, everything else was horrible. Pizza land is the worst pizzeria that i have ever been to, extremely dirty tables, greasy floors and the noise factor is outrageous and you have to scream to be heard. I'd rather stand next to a jet turbine.
Server rushed us the entire evening. Almost threw the \"small plates\" at us. Didn't give us clean side plates when our pizza came (for sharing). Swept away crumbs while still eating and pushed our plates out of way while eating. Front counter staff is very rude and they don't let you dine in after 9 pm, not even for quick bite, although this restaurant close at 10 pm, They will literally throw you out while eating, i found people sitting on the side walk eating their food.
I would never go to this restaurant again. Highly recommend to stay away from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here the other day with my boyfriend. The food was good for an amazing price. Their whole menu is filled with great deals. The service was fairly quick. I wish there was a Pizza Land in Burlington!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome food.  It has great halal pizzas, wings, rotisserie chicken, etc.   I agree with the previous review,  the place could use a touch up but the service is great.  Place is packed, hence the noise level. 

I would definitely recommend people to try this place out."}
