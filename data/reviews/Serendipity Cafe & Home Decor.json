{"text":"Serendipity is a funky, jack-of-all-trades type of a business.  The back of the store has an eclectic mix of gifts, furniture, and home decor items.  The front of the shop is a cafe serving soup, sandwiches, salads, smoothies, dainties, and a wide variety of espresso coffees.  The food was reasonably priced and the baked goods looked pretty tasty, so I guess if you can get past the strange idea of eating while sitting inside a Pier One Imports, then you'll be right at home here.  And if you were coming here to shop for an upholstered couch, you have to trust that mothers have kept their little tykes away from the furniture after eating one of the brownies from the cafe."}
{"text":"Excellent food and at reasonable prices.  I love coming here especially over Bites Grocery cafe and Starbucks for three reasons.  They have their own vibe that is unique.  They are not urban barn, nor do they pretend to be.  They are not a big chain like Starbucks, nor do they aspire to be.  The prices beat everyone else on 9th ave and its homemade!  Lastly they are a local family trying making a go of things and doing a great job!"}
{"text":"Serendipity is a bit of a contradiction, there is a cafe area in the front that serves very cheap lunch and breakfast items, and then the back area is like walking into a mediocre Urban Barn.  

The cafe items seem to be simple lunch and breakfast items; sandwiches, salads, omelettes, and everything is pretty much under $8.  The girl at the cafe counter was very friendly but what exactly was her boss thinking.

If you walk to the back of the cafe/store you will find upholstered furniture, mirrors, frames, mugs, greeting cards essential oils, body creams, gift baskets and pillows.  Honestly it just feels tacky and kind of schizophrenic.  It is like the store owner wanted to do everything and couldn't decide.  The back area doesn't really blend in with the cafe in the front, and it is almost like going into two locations with two separate owners.

It would be better if he/she/they concentrated on home furnishing and did that well than amalgamate so many random things together.

Maybe that is the play on serendipity but for me it just feels like one cosmic joke."}
