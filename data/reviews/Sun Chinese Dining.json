{"text":"I LOVE this Orange Chicken. super Crunchy and just enough Spicy. I go here all the time and Staff is so attentive. I Crave it even after i just had some lol love it so much."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was very surprised at how bad the food was. Been there before years ago but this time the Sweet and Sour Shrimp was basically all breaded with heavy sauce. The Cashew Chicken portion was generous but bland. Fast service but unfortunately I will not return"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise Sun Chinese Dining was. I've never had Chinese Korean food. We shared the spicy seafood soup and the sweet and sour pork. The portions are large and perfect for sharing - you will have leftovers unless you're with a big group. I really enjoyed the food and can't wait to try some other items on the menu.

It's a keep on my list!"}
{"text":"Best Korean-Chinese place in the Tucson-Phoenix area.  It's just like how I remember from Korea!  Not only do they taste great but also the portions are enormous.  We always order Jjambbong (spicy seafood noodle), Jjajangmyun (blackbean noodles) and tangsooyook (sweet & sour pork). So sad to hear they will be retiring in November, so you better go as much as you can before they close!"}
{"text":"Minus 5 star here.
One of Chinese lady turn me ... well kick lots of people out include my wife and I.
On Saturday @2:30 p.m. Saying that they ran out of food. 
Wow really????
What kind of restaurant ran out their foods on weekend? Perhaps  put signage next time.
Lastly answer the phone don't  just hang up on me."}
{"text":"Their service is so rude!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If u ask when ur food gonna be ready, their answer is 
\"i dont know\"
Also, they do not smile. And if new customers walk in, they looked so unhappy.

Seems like servers dont want to be busy.

If u wanna be pissed off today, this is the right place for you."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I was just dying for jampong and jajangmyun. 
We went on Friday night it was very busy.  We ordered jang-pong, tang-sue-uk(sweet and sour pork Korean style) and orange chicken. 
The portion is huge. It was pretty tasty except orange chicken.  The batter was way too thick and hardly no meat. 
I can say I had better and worst. From that this place is kind of middle. 
I will go back to try jajangmyun."}
{"text":"Restaurant was busy. We felt as though we were actually in another country as the only Caucasians, but the service was great and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"I got the simple orange chicken and the cook put almost no chicken in the meal. I spent more time looking for chicken than eating. The waitresses were fine and polite."}
{"text":"REVIEW UPDATE: this was my 3rd visit to this restaurant and it will be my last. The service is beyond disappointing and  has motivated me to update this review. The food was overall pretty decent. I went in a group of 9 people for a church outing and their customer service was absolutely terrible. We ordered 3 gan jjajangs, 3 jjampongs, 1 order of yang jang pi and gganpoong shrimp. Again, the food is pretty decent but service was horrendous. We asked for extra bowls, napkins and water. The waitress provided 3 bowls for 9 people to share and returned with no extra napkins and refilled out waters half way! We then asked for more bowls a second time and the waitress claimed that they had no more bowls and walked away shaking her head with a very blatant negative attitude. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"Best place in town for Korean Chinese food, especially tangsuyuk (sweet and sour pork) and jja jang myun (black bean noodles).  Prior to making this my regular place for jja jang myun cravings, I enjoyed Chef Chiang.  However, in comparing the two restaurants, I found that Sun Chinese offers the same or better quality dishes at a lower price.  Of course no place in AZ can compare with actual Chinese delivery food in Korea, but this place is legit!"}
{"text":"We ordered chicken Lettuce wrap for a meal and needed little more lettuce.
So I asked to bring more , was told they don't give out free extra lettuce.
I said ok just bring some we'll pay.
We got about 5 tiny lettuce leaves and they charged 2 dollars for that.
I talked to the owner that charge was too much.
She completely ignored me and walk away......."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, and the food was on point. Would have beeen a 5 star but the service was a bit slow. Waitress only came by twice. Once to take the order and the seccond time only to bring the food. Other than that, it is a great family and social dinning place."}
{"text":"Discovered this place today.  Went there for lunch. I had shrimp w lobster sauce and befriend Hunan shrimp.  Portions were huge and the prices were cheap. Also get free hot tea. Service was good. Will definitely come back. I don't know why there are low ratings for this place. This place was awesome."}
{"text":"The last time I ate here I immediately got food poisoning and was ill.  Never coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"Had to order the black bean noodles by asking the server, I couldn't find it on the menu. Food was so delicious! So happy I found this place and will be a regular for sure."}
{"text":"So, it figures. After four years of living in Phoenix, I would FINALLY find a great Chinese restaurant, oh... approximately six weeks before I move out of the city for good. 

Sigh. 

I came here the other night with my husband and we picked a few items off the menu. Our food was out within 10 minutes. The portions were very big, and the food (except for the egg rolls) was less greasy than what you get at a lot of other Chinese restaurants around here.
My husband had General Tso's chicken, which was tasty, and I ordered the tofu and veggies. The tofu was fried, but lightly, so it didn't get greasy, and the dish was loaded up with crisp veggies including broccoli, carrots, water chestnuts, baby corn..the usual.

It was so good.

Also, this joint has the BEST EGG DROP SOUP I've tasted in Phoenix. Seriously.
I'll be honest, I have no idea how Sun Chinese Dining is for more traditional Chinese food. Because that's not really what I'm interested in. But I can tell you that this place does the typical American Chinese food really, really well!"}
{"text":"I wish this place was Lin's again! The food, quality and service were so much better!!"}
{"text":"OK so I've written a review about a year ago, and I went back to this place since my mother of all people were insisting that they are much better now.  Apparently the ownership has changed twice since a year ago, and now the new owner is making some decent dishes.  

This is a Korean style Chinese food, which's totally different from your Sichuan or Cantonese food.  I tried the usual staples such as the JjamBong and Jjajangmyun as well as the Tang Soo Yook.  I remembered that they don't make the Tang Soo Yook sweet enough, so when I ordered I told them to make it extra sweet.  The sweet and sour sauce for this is suppose to be sweet.  Everything came out tasty and I was quite pleased!  The service on the other hand....is still the pits.  :(

Yes, they do have a separate menu for the \"Americans\" who like the \"Americanized Chinese\" food.  I've never looked at those menu, but I'm sure they have your staple orange chicken, general Tso's chicken, pot stickers, etc.  :)

So I upped the review for this place to one more star.  It's more like 3 1/2, but I won't round up, just cuz their service isn't to my liking.  They don't say hi, they don't greet you properly, the servers never smile, they don't come around often.  But I deal with this place, because they're the only one of such Korean Chinese restaurant in the Phoenix Metro area.   Sigh~ (yes again)  :)"}
{"text":"No no no.. incredibly slow and rude service, takes forever to get service and food is incredibly bland, boring, and rubbery. The lady who showed me to my table gave me the family menu and got annoyed that I asked for the lunch menu.. um, I don't want to pay over $20 for my lunch. I had higher hopes for this experience, but it turns out I was greatly disappointed. First time here, and last time as well."}
{"text":"They did not honor the check-in deal for a free appetizer so beware or let them know before you plan to use it.

The sweet and sour chicken we got was pretty good. Yang jang pi was huge but the mustard/wasabi(?) sauce was way too overpowering. Those two dishes and the passable wings ran us $55 but was enough to feed 5. 

And the ladies that work here are kind of cranky."}
{"text":"My wife talked talked me into this place as she had gone in for lunch.

Some of the best and authentic tasting Chinese food I have ever had. Given that I've never visited China, this place has a different but great flavor. 

The dining room is fairly large and but kind of out dated. As a side note: we've never eaten there, always take out. 

The employees are very friendly and also demonstrate kind gestures to my son while plays in the lobby. 

The prices are more than reasonable and they even have family dinner packages. However, even the regular menu items are very generous portions.

If you happen to visit this place, you have to try their crab puffs! Oh my! They are delicious.

The times we've ordered take out that pack our food nicely in plastic grocery bags with a card board base to eliminate the possibility of spilling."}
{"text":"So this is not Chinese food BUT Korean style Chinese food.  So for non-Koreans it's Korean food and for Koreans it's Chinese food, make sense? It's AZ and this is as good as Korean food gets.  I'd def order the sweet and sour pork or chicken, see the pic Then the spicy seafood soup () and then the black bean noodles ().  These are the most common dishes for Korean-Chinese food.  The portions are huge so good bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"The price is reasonable and the portions are huge! Also, the management has changed back to the previous owners so things are a bit different!

{"text":"I've only eaten at Sun Chinese Dining for lunch, but every experience has been a good one! Lots of food for the price. I like that I get soup and salad before my entree. They do love the celery though! Each dish I've ordered including the egg flower soup is laced with celery. I like celery, but if you are not a fan then be sure to ask for them to tone it down."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a find in what appears to be a commercial building, possibly a former office building. 
Never would have found it with out the referral from a friend. 

We had the lunch special plus an order of delicious egg rolls. The service and food were worthy of the 5 stars. Pricing is very reasonable considering you get the soup, salad and generous portioned entree. 
Bonus: they have brown rice and great hot green tea! 
I will be back to take advantage of the Check-in offer!"}

Lunch special menu:
Scallop with Chinese Vegetables (3.5*)  it's not really Chinese veggies but  broccoli, snow peas, baby corn & carrot.  The waitress told us that before when we ordered.   The sauce is slightly different than the typical oyster base brown sauce but still very tasty.

Service 4*

Cons:  
- Korean Chinese menu very limited 
- Kim Chi were too raw"}
{"text":"I do not recommend their 'honey walnut shrimp'. Too much mayonnaise, they must of slopped an entire jar on it. The shrimp batter was thick and cakey, not light and airy. Informed the waitress I didn't like this dish at all and it didn't appear I ate it. She just threw it out without offering me a different item."}
{"text":"If you don't want MSG in your food, tell the server before you place the order.

Lunch prices are good."}
{"text":"Suns had returned to their previous manager.  This place has HUGE portion sizes, so be sure to bring a lot of friends.  There's a mixed cold platter (sounds something like leung jang pei) which we always get.  Another good dish its the Mongolian beef with sweet sauce served over a bed of crispy noodle bits.  The place usually isn't to busy, so it's nice and quiet.

As a heads up, this is more of a Chinese-Korean  place, so dont expect a lot is side dishes.  There's only a plate of kimchi, but it is suupppeer good and sour."}
{"text":"Had food from here again few wks ago for takeout and great tasting! I had the beef chajangmyun and sweet & sour pork. I found out that the reason my chajangmyun tasted funny last time was because it was seafood kind and not the beef kind, there were different ones. So it was freaking fantastic this time! I want to try their jjambong but would be best to eat it there since it is hot soup. Maybe when the temps are cooler and hot soup would hit the spot sooooo much better. I'm salivating!"}
{"text":"Fast service, large portions, tasty food. Try the spicy seafood soup, vegetable lo mein and mu-shu chicken."}
{"text":"Their food is really good. But their servers are horrible. Also their times are not updated and will refuse to seat you. And sometimes will just refuse to seat you when their closing time is a little over an hour later."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for me actually. Ambience looks homey - like your single 70 year old aunt that owns a cat kind of house. Interior and tables were painted with off green and light pink. But it doesn't smell bad though. We were seated after like 3 minutes of waiting, though it wasn't busy even if it was lunch time. Server got us some wonton strips and sauces to start plus some tea. She didn't really say anything. Then we ordered chicken wings for appetizer, one of the beef entrees Feung something (starts with an F idk forgot) and Shrimp LoMein. 

Chicken wings arrived, it was meh. I've had better. Though it was served hot and crispy so it was kinda good. Then the 2 entrees came. Size is huge! Totes worth your money. The beef entree wasn't that bad, it wasn't as spicy as I've hoped but it's okay. Shrimp Lomein on the other hand was bomb though! The sauce was flavorful, noodles weren't soggy and there were a lot of shrimps.

Total bill was around 24 bucks, and we were full. Even had the leftovers to go. So 29 bucks all in all plus tip. Not bad. Would try other dishes for sure. Still hoping to be wowed."}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow, even though there were few customers. The servers were rude, and ignored the table after we asked where the food was after an hour. When served, some of the food was cold.
There was an 18% gratuity that was added to our party of 6 without prior notice.
The sweet and sour pork was disappointing; The sauce was overpowering, and the pork itself was completely tasteless. The noodle servings were smaller compared to other customers - we suspect they stiffed us on purpose. The noodle dish tasted good, but I'm not going back for it."}
{"text":"Wow. I never thought I would taste authentic Korean-Chinese dishes here in Arizona! Amazing everything. I wish I had known about this place earlier... Coming back again with my lil' sis!! Their serving size is huge so my friend and I both went back home with leftovers. Love love love :) I wish I could give more stars. I am so glad to have found this new (although it has been there for a long time) restaurant!"}
{"text":"Yelp says open until 2am.  The front door says open until 10pm.  We arrived at 920 pm.  Waitress told us we could order but had to hurry they were closing at 930pm.  We decided to leave and they never asked us to come again or said anything she just turned around and walked aqay.   Close to home but won't return."}
{"text":"Rain prevented us from golfing one day, so the four of us decided to get something to eat.  Heard there were some good Chinese restaurants in Chandler and didn't have a specific place in mind.  Just drove and happened on Sun Chinese.  My husband and I are Chinese so we know Chinese food and this was not it.  Not until reading the other reviews did we realize it was a \"Korean Chinese\" restaurant.  Never heard of such a thing.  Maybe they do Korean well, but the \"Chinese\" food we order was not good.  The waitress first brought out a small portion of  fried won ton strips w/ a sweet and sour sauce for dipping that were greasy and tasted like they had been sitting around for days. Hot and sour soup had way too much cornstarch.  Other main dishes also weren't that great and some of it was just strange."}
{"text":"ALERT! New owner and new management.

First off, we went to Sun tonight for the 5.99 noodle special.  We went around 7 pm.  There was 1 table that was just finishing up.  After that table left, we were the only table.  We had 6 adults and 1 child.  We ordered (1) Kung Pao Shrimp, (4) noodle specials, (2) black bean noodles, and (1) Vegetable and Rice Platter. 

We were given our drinks first.  The water was horrendous.  I remember that they used to serve filtered water and it tasted great.  I believe the new owners probably didn't see the need for filtered water and just used straight up Chandler tap water. 

Anyways, we sat for 1 hour until our first dishes came out.  The Kung Pao Shrimp and Vegetable Rice Platter.  The Kung Pao Shrimp is usually not deep fried, but the outer portion was not even crispy.  The sauce was bland and the vegetables were old.  The onions and bell peppers tasted so old.  The Vegetable Rice Platter was just deep fried rice, vegetable assortment and mushrooms and whatever they felt like they needed to throw away.  The mushrooms especially were just gross!  

We waited another 15-20 minutes for the Noodles to come out.  The black bean noodles were disgusting.  The sauce had so much corn starch and salt that it was unbearable.  The prior owners made the noodles very good, but usually the sauce was watery.  However the new owners put more starch and more salt and it was just unbearable.  The best thing that came out was the noodle special because everything else tasted so terrible and it was the cheapest thing.  

Even though we sat there no waitress came by or even acknowledged what was going on.  In addition, there were probably 3-4 tables in there tops.  My father asked why everything took so long and the waitress just said that there were so many orders.  And we asked them to just take a look around the restaurant.  She just apologized repeatedly. 

Then when we got our bill, they took the liberty to tack on the 18% gratuity on top of our bill.  We only had 6 adults and 1 child!.  We went in for the 5.99 special and came out with a over 100 dollar tab.  

I just got home and needed to write this in order to let people know not to waste their money.  It's the same look, but everything is terribly wrong here.  It will probably go out of business if they don't take notice of what's going on.  I'm just praying that I don't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"So far this has been the best Chinese food I've had on the east side ! Fair warning,  they won't accept the Yelp coupon for a free appetizer ! Change in management? Something along those lines . Back to the food . The menu is your typical beef, chicken , seafood , vege selections . Prices range $7.99-10.99. 
We had an order of 2 egg rolls for an appetizer and they were great ! Hot, crispy and not greasy . For dinner we ordered orange beef and sesame chicken . Both dishes were fantastic and portions were huge! We took 1/2 of our dishes home and made 2 more meals from the leftovers. I need to go back and try beef & broccoli & the chicken corn soup"}
{"text":"living in phoenix seriously sucks for k peeps. this place is like a mental escape to LA ktown. since i have to drive like 50 miles to get here from north phoenix, bring a friend or two to make it worth more! people who eat together are happy together."}
{"text":"This place also has an excellent Korean-Chinese menu.  Look for the alternate menu given to the Asian folks.  They have dished that Koreans expect in a Chinese restaurant - has very little in common with American-Chinese dishes."}
{"text":"Went there the other day with my mother.  I had the jampong (spicy korean/chinese noodle soup) it was so delicious and huge!  The staff was very friendly, will for sure go there again for the food and friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"The best traditional real Korean Kimchi, ever. 
FYI, Most Chinese-Korean fusion restaurant serve you the cheap un-fermented cabbage Kimchi, even at a good restaurants,  but this place had real napa cabbage Kimchi that is fermented over time. It's difficult to bring out the real fermented kimchi because customers are constantly eating and most of the restaurants don't have time for kimchi to be fermented over time (at least a month). 

This is a Korean Style Chinese fusion restaurant. 
Basically it's a Korean restaurant that makes Chinese style food that's good for Koreans. So if you are looking for real Chinese food, this ain't the place. If you like Korean-Chinese style Chinese food, you came to a right place. 

Compare to this type of restaurants in Los Angeles and Orange County, it's not bad, but among Korean restaurants here in Phoenix, this is the best so far. 

I've ordered jajangmyeon(stir-fried noodles with chinese bean sauce) and jjambbong (spicey seafood noodle soup), and tangsuyuk (sweet and sour pork). All very good. Not the best but best in town. If it was in LA, probably get 3 star overall. In the land of the blind, the man with one eye is the king. 

*My Ratings:
1)jajangmyeon: 5 If in LA: 3.5
2)jjambbong: 5 if in LA: 3.5
3)tangsuyuk: 5 if in in LA: 3.8
4)Kimchi:5++  if in LA: 5++
5)Service: 4.5 if in LA: 4.5 
=====================
over all: 4.9 if in LA: 4.06

{"text":"Good Chinese. Service was good. Large portions. The veggie egg roll wasn't the best. The lo mein was average, but good. The egg drop soup and orange chicken were exceptional."}
{"text":"Sun Chinese is a place i would eat maybe every year cause i forgot how it tasted last year. I had a few different dishes to give the place a shot. only plate i enjoy is the fried pork but i ate it with hot sauce instead of the sweet and sour sauce it comes with.."}
{"text":"Whenever I need my jja Jang myun fix we always come to Suns.. It always satisfies our cravings.."}
{"text":"This is a Korean-style Chinese food restaurant. The majority of their menu is typical American Chinese food (and their take-out menu is only American Chinese food), but there is a Korean section in the dine-in menu -- and that is what I recommend ordering from if you're interested in trying fairly authentic Korean-style Chinese food. The prices seem steep for some items, but I guarantee you - the portions are huge and can easily feed two people. 

Liang chang Pi (~$20 a HUGE mixture of shrimp, meats, veggies.), Tang Su Yuk (Korean sweet and sour pork - lighter breading and tangy sauce ~$14), Ja Jang Myeon (~$9 black bean paste noodle). Everything was pretty tasty - be sure to mix the Liang chang Pi, but not with the yellow sauce that comes on the side. That's like a mustard sauce, which I'm not a mustard fan. The sweet/sour sauce for the Tang Su Yuk also comes on the side, which is awesome because it tasted good with the liang chang pi, too. Ja Jang Myeon had shrimp, squid, pork, onions, and zucchini - pretty loaded compared to traditional ja jang myeon.  

FYI: They don't honor their check-in offer - so don't be surprised if you ask for your free appetizer and they say 'no'. Also....don't let that deter you too much from coming here...."}
{"text":"Since the previous owner took over the restaurant again, my husband I have returned to the restaurant. Korean Chinese food they serve is great and the owner have been kind to us. The reason my ratings have reduced to 3 stars is because of the rude waitresses they now have there. We no longer eat at the restaurant because we can't stand to be served by this particular woman in short hair and glasses. She's always been extremely rude, loud and lazy. With our luck, we always end up being served by her so we decided not to eat at the restaurant and only do take out. They used to have great servers, what happened? But yes, the food is still great and the owner is very nice so we still support this place but would be nice to eat at the restaurant every now and then..... :("}
{"text":"Huh? They say the Yelp checkin deal is no longer valid... Shouldn't have advertised it!!"}
{"text":"I have to give this place a three. It is hard to find great Chinese food that is t going to make me feel sick from all the oil. But boy is this place tasty. The shrimp fried rice, the egg drop soup, the tea!! So tasty. The lunch special is the best deal by far, I recommend it if you are working in the area. However, I give Sun a three because the horrible customer service. They are slow and almost always go over my one hour for lunch. I only won't 3 or 4 minds away so I find it silly that I am late."}
{"text":"Here is the deal.... Sun Chinese does have chinese food. The real appeal of this place is that they serve on a separate menu to those of us who know anything about Chinese infused Korean dishes. You won't get the menu unless you ask. If you do brave to ask, I would recommend the sweet and sour pork (korean style). I would also highly recommend the soy bean noodle (aka. JaJangMyun). If you like a super spicy dish on a cold day go for the spicy seafood soup (JamBong). 

I can't say anything about their primary menu cause most of the asians and those like myself who grew up in Asia who go to the place ask for the Korean menu. They are the only place in AZ that serve korean chinese food and for that they get 5 stars and a huge thank you."}
