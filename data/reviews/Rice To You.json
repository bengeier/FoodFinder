{"text":"I just got food from rice to you and it was terrible not just bad it was uneditable. I recommend that you steer clear. I should have known by the smells when I walked in. Sorry I don't normally speek bad about a place."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! I keep coming here for the best chinese food with good portions. Yes it's not the best looking area or place, but you can't go wrong here. If your looking for looks go to P.F Changs. If your looking for amazing chinese food come here!!!"}
{"text":"Food made to order, fresh ingredients, friendly staff and fair prices! What more can you ask for?  I stopped in after working in the field all day.  I was staying at a hotel close by and my fellow Yelpers did not let me down.  I played it safe and had the beef fried rice and the beef broccoli. 

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the limited selection of drinks available to go but if I could give 1/2 star this would be a 4.5--the deduct had nothing to do with food selection, prep or portion.  Just me...not wanting to stop at an additional place to pickup a drink."}
{"text":"this place will kind of throw you off when you first step with the wall nic nacs and the display that sells body wash and toothpaste next to chop sticks and such but the food is surprisingly delicious.. my husband order the chicken curry friee rice with orange chicken and he loved it. i had the chicken and beef chop suey and was not disappointed. kudos to this joint could do with some spring cleaning and a little sprucing up but good all the same"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Huge portions! Great people!

I came in after 7pm after work, and ordered the Mongolian beef. Your choice of spicyness! And like my fellow yelpers, they did not disappoint! Yes, it's a whole in the wall and not the cleanest place, but the food and people more than make up for that! 

If you truly are an Asian food lover then you can not pass this place up!"}
{"text":"This place is to die for. Great food great prizes. Everything is made to order from scratch hot out the kitchen, definitely one of my favorite Chinese cuisine places."}
{"text":"Cheap and you get alot . I ordered chicken fried rice and they delivered it to my apartment fast ."}
{"text":"Place has been around for ever but never had eaten there until a recent Friday evening. My thought was, this place has been open for years so it must be good. I was sadly disappointed. Probably the least appetizing Chinese food I've had in my life. Ingredients were of low quality with no taste."}
{"text":"Figured I would try this spot since it was close to home and didn't get to bad of reviews on here. However I am NOT satisfied with this place. 

I ordered the sesame chicken with white rice and got my DD chicken lo mein. Her food was fine but my sesame chicken was D R Y and the rice taste mircowaved!! So disappointed, most likely won't be returning."}
{"text":"An easy walk from the LaQuinta--if you don't mind two busy street crossings. Worth the trip. Extensive menu. Two of us shared chicken fried rice and shrimp foo young. Both dishes were fresh and delicious. We left well fed and carrying a menu for hotel delivery when we come back through next week."}
{"text":"C'mon yelpers! This place is horrible, can't even finish my lunch. This kung pao chicken is garbage. They use the cheapest, most disgusting part of the chicken to make this meal! The meat is dark, fatty, and doesn't even taste like chicken. Plus the portion is tiny. I should have known walking into this dump. If you want REAL asian food that would blow your mind and make you never ever ever come back to this dump, go to T&J Asian Cuisine on 107th ave and Olive. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Excellent Customer Service! Great Prices and Cheap Delivery! I Love Their Chicken Lo Mein mixed with Pepper Steak and White Rice,(Which I created on my own with their Specialty Plates I bought and had delivered, for my family. Surprisingly it was so hot that sitting on my lap it was burning me through my pants and the bag it was delivered in. I will Come back here to try all their specialties as I am a Chinese food Fanatic and this is the best Chinese Place I have found that  that Delivers as well! ANd Charge less to Deliver than I  I would have to pay to Drive there in my big a$$ Truck.  I Look forward to future experiences Thanks for being the best Chinese food delivery restaurant in Phoenix Arizona."}
{"text":"I love the food all of it .  specially the house fried rice !! Yummy for my tummy

Very fast service .  I'm always hungry for a combo A platter :)
."}
{"text":"Funny after my stellar last review I went back and checked this place out again.  Wow.  What complete jerks.  All I wanted was Tso's Chicken and they were total dicks when they told me they didn't have it.  They really seemed annoyed.  So I and Carlos Sr just left and ended up at IN-N-OUT in Avondale.  LOL"}
{"text":"This place is really a 3 star for me but I gave it a 4 because the food was so freshly made.  They only cook it once you order it here you can taste the freshness in this place.  It is definitely a hole in the wall.  It is a little dingy inside.  I compare all chinese food places to my favorite place \"good china located at 67th and Thomas\" so that is why it is very hard to beat for me.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This was the worst food i ever had. They messed up our order when they delivered it. So we had to call and I brought the rest of the food. My daughter got sick a few hours  later and I believe she got food poisoning. So my review on this is do not eat here"}
{"text":"I'm a big Chop Suey fan but its not a lunch special  so I ordered off the regular menu, I can't say I was impressed, although the veggies were crunchy there wasn't much flavor to the sauce.

The booths are dirty and this old building is in great need of a remodel.  I wouldn't have ever stopped in if it weren't for some glowing reviews by other Yelpers.

To top it off there was constant yelling or arguing coming from the kitchen and a man putting boxes together behind a screen in the dining room, ever heard one of those loud tape dispensers throughout your meal!?

I visited this location off it's previous reviews and I have to say they disappointed me."}
{"text":"Today I gave Rice To You a try hidden in the corner.but I have to admit that I even had my doubts. 
I ordered the Curry chicken fried rice $7.50 came in a large box really hot freshly made and it  tastes really good.next time I would love to try the Cantonese chicken or duck with my fried rice."}
{"text":"This place was convenient and fast. The price range is average the food average. I would come back because it's not bad and close to where I need to be plus the servings are nice"}
{"text":"Five stars for the duck. It's special order so they don't have it all the time but it is amazing. Better than the duck I've had in new China town in California."}
{"text":"I got food from here delivered to my job and as I went to take a bite of my fried rice, there was a roach in there. It was the most disgusting thing ever. I will NEVER be back there again."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place more stars. My dad has been bringing this stuff home spontaneously for over 5 years now and boy am I GLAD he does. The only thing we really get here is the pork fried rice but it is TO DIE FOR. It's the best I've had and it's relatively cheap! 7 bucks feeds you + 1, if you're THAT hungry. I love this place and the food is so good I can't help but get more even when I'm already stuffed. Not to mention the owners are SO friendly and very appreciative of your service."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here we went and checked it out.  Staying at the Red Roof accross the steet so it was a nice walk.  
We've been there 3 times for the past couple of weeks and each time the food has been awesome.  Just had the best Egg Drop soup I have ever had.  The food is very fresh.  The people are really nice too.
Like others have said, it is a hole in the wall, don't expect a fancy place.  Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Great food reasonable prices and quick delivery!! First time I order delivery to my home and it was delicious specially when your sick at home and hove to feed the family! Will definitely order again! Kids loved it and so did the husband! Chop Sui was fire!!"}
{"text":"My delivery order totaled 30.03 to begin with after ordering a beef and broccoli combination plate and a sweet & sour chicken combination plate, both substituting egg rolls in place of the fried egg rolls. A small order of chicken lo mein and 2 extra regular egg rolls. 

Being on a truck you don't often get access to Chinese food and it is definitely a change of pace from wendys, mcds, subway, and arbys.... so we gave it a whirl.

45 minutes after placing the order, the guy FINALLY shows up... nice enough gentleman. I make sure everything is there... go to the truck to eat.

Sweet and sour chicken combo plate... chicken is fried can't really go so wrong there.... the \"fried rice\" tastes like it was boiled rice thrown into a pan with cheap and stale canola oil. Soy sauce made it SO much worse.

Beef and broccoli combo plate... was done great. No complaints.

The egg rolls were so over peppered we couldn't bare to eat more than 3/4 of one each and lost out on two extras

Chicken lo mein... it was DEFINITELT chicken in there... smelled and tasted like fish! 

Got 9.00 back .... over half the food went to waste"}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food, and they deliver in area (our only other option is pizza). 
I really like their egg rolls and wanton soup. My partner usually gets the orange chicken but she says she likes the kind from panda express better. 
I would give them another star but delivery is always 45 minutes and they are never able to take a credit/debit card for the last 6 months."}
{"text":"My family and I love it here. We order to go. The place might be a little off, but the food is really good. Shrimp fried rice, yummy."}
{"text":"I ordered orange chicken,kung pow & shrimp and vegetables. Everything was so delicious and you can really tell its freshly made with fresh ingredients. I ordered \"to go\" ,next time im going to try delivery;) this is my new favorite chinese spot!"}
{"text":"Now, finding this place was a bit tricky.

This was a pit stop on the way to Cali from Texas.

The owner is SUPER nice and they have two menus, which if you are Asian, you know what I mean.

I ordered soup and a cup of soup is much larger than what I am used to. I was verrrry happy about that.

The square it's located in had a quince store (store specifically for quincinera dresses) and some place (I will assume) sells TVs/used electronics.

The prices are reasonable, portions are large- def family style and when the brothers asked for the Vietnamese equivalent of Chinese dishes (bc they only know the Vietnamese name and not the Chinese), the lady not only understood but was able to suggest dishes, if she didn't have the exact dish. The brothers also knew some basic Chinese (food, mainly lol) so that helped.

The owner speaks English, so no fear if you are not a native Chinese speaker.

The neighborhood looks sketchy, lock your stuff up tight in the car.

You can order take away, too."}
{"text":"The location is pretty sketchy, and the sign on the building just says \"Chinese Food\". It looked questionable but it was highly recommended by a friend so we checked it out. Don't get the fountain drinks, they were super flat. But the most surprising thing of all was that the food was delicious! Im not a beef and broccoli lover myself but it really was the highlight of the meal. The noodles and fried rice had a lot of brussel sprouts so caution when offering to picky eaters. The woman who waited on us was refreshingly friendly and I have to say, I enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"Went to dine-in with my husband and it is WONDEFUL!  Sweet owner, great staff, and (while the neighborhood is not great), she has a nice, clean little place!  Please, please eat here and keep it in business.  You can't beat \"non-chain\" restuarants!"}
{"text":"The place is a little tricky to find, as someone else had mentioned. It's tucked away in the far corner of a strip mall on 51st and McDowell, and the sign on the building doesn't indicate the business name, only \"Chinese Food.\" As other reviewers have noted, the facility itself isn't visually impressive, but the owner was very nice. I ordered the chicken egg foo young. This is 3 patties, and comes with steamed or fried rice. Cost for this, including tax, was just over $9. They cooked it for me right after I ordered it - no reheated stuff! The egg foo young was JUST crisp on the outside, as I like it. So many places will bring this soggy mess, but this was perfect. Sauce served on the side, in a separate bowl with a spoon. Veggies were crisp-tender, and the dish had great flavor. Fried rice had fresh cilantro and egg, but no veggies like some places serve. Loved the food!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. I've been coming here since I was a young child and this is my favorite take out spot. The family who owns the restaurant is super nice and accommodating. My favorites are the war wonton, house lo mein, and the amazing chicken wings. Whenever I come back home from university I always try to eat here."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices, and the best Hot & Sour soup I have ever had! I am definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"Some of their food is really greasy, but their fried rice and orange chicken is good."}
{"text":"I really fought between 2 or three stars. I like the people who work there. Their egg foo young patties are done just the way I like it. The problem is their rice sucks! Also the food generally taste weird especially the gravy for the egg foo you. The little dipping sauce was the kind of nasty that makes you wonder did the put something strange in there."}
{"text":"Love the food here.  Very generous portion and great taste.  Highly recommended."}
