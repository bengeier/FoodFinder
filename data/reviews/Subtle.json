{"text":"Taking over the space that Christopher's once occupied, Subtle is a quaint and simple restaurant.  

I randomly went for $5 Burger Night (which is every Wednesday) - although I don't eat red meat, there was a spicy black bean burger option I happily ordered (Bonus: they have since added a portabello burger).  Everything was very good - the fries, burger, and gin martini w/ bleu cheese stuffed olives were all solid.

Happy Hour is also worth going to - 1/2 off appetizers, $5 martinis, and $2.50 beers.  Note: Thursdays are $5 Martini Night and goes all night.

The menu is best described as semi upscale pub fare: a nice balance of comfort and elegant food options.

One thing I particularly appreciate is that they listen to their customers - they have been continually enhancing their menu based on the feedback received."}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me and took me to this newly opened restaurant in Aurora after reading about what sounded like a superior vegetarian dish on the online menu.
Upon arrival, we were seated in a less than comfortable room with terrible acoustics that provided for full exposure to the two other table's conversations.
The waitress proceeded to stop by and tell us it was \"date night\" and handed a special menu to the two of us with a seemingly \"too good to pass up\" offer of $50 for appetizers, salads/soups, entree, bottle of wine, and dessert.
The appetizer was delicious and we would have eaten much more had we known the terrible food ahead of us. My salad was nothing more than ICEBERG lettuce - something I could have ventured to my local McDonalds and eaten. The dressing was a lemon dressing that tasted like the smell of roadside bathroom air freshener. My boyfriend's soup was so spicey it lost all hint of flavor and he never quite recovered to enjoy the rest of his meal. Of course, the one dish for which we had chosen the restaurant was not available on said \"date night,\" even discussing my food allergies for everything that was. I resorted to a noodle dish in which the noodles were out of stock that evening and a plain penne noodle were substituted in the end...with alfredo sauce? Not even sure what sauce it was. The chicken dish that my boyfriend had was dry, flavorless and clearly just reheated, not made fresh at all.
I could go on and on, not to mention the waitress literally forgetting EVERYTHING we ordered, but you get the drift. Awful. When we responded to the question, \"how is your food?\" with \"it's ok,\" wouldn't that be your first hint to try to change the experience? 
To top off the night, we were told to leave the opposite side of the restaurant to where our car was was parked to avoid the icy sidewalk. With the amount of staff on the clock that evening, you would think one of them would put on a coat and shovel. or salt. or whatever most reputable restaurants do to accommodate their customers.
Bottom line is...there is nothing \"subtle\" about the poor quality of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Rats, my wife really wants Subtle to succeed, but we were extremely disappointed with the entire experience.  It took the waitress 15 minutes to come to our table. We had to ask for bread and she did not bring it out until right before our meal arrived.  The $26 grouper was no more than 4 oz.  My wife did like her pork chops.  Someone needs to tell the owner if you are going to use white table clothes make sure they are ironed.

We will only return for burger night and the 2.50 beers, but we cannot justify the cost for full dinner."}
{"text":"On a business trip I stop in on a recommendation.  Nice sweet wait staff, and if you like spicy you must have the tomato bisque with the caramelized bacon and toped with provolone.  I had What I think was the signature dish... Bone in pork chop with a mouth watering spice rub. By the way they must have improved the salad because it was far from iceberg.  The waitress suggested the homemade chocolate cheese cake, I forced it down happily.  As full as I was and a couple glasses of wine I worried about the bill, but it was very reasonable for my belly fullness."}
