{"text":"I'm finding all kinds of iconic burger places to review on yelp. This is an iconic burger dive that brings back fond memories from my youth. The burgers used to be good and homemade. Fresh cut fries and freshly made onion rings, just killer. They've changed a lot since then, frozen patties and frozen fries/rings don't taste as good. Buns fall apart to easily. The burgers are still massive and the portions are fairly decent, better than paying $9.00 at mCdonalds for their crappy premium burgers. Fun decor, staff are fine. Solid 3 stars but if they would have kept the original recipes an easy 5 stars."}
{"text":"I recently went to this location and had to say that I was off put by the atmosphere. I usually go to a Wimpy's in North York when I take my grandmother out, and know what to expect with the decor and the food.
This location however, seems run down. The seats were torn and the floors were dirty and worn. The washrooms are located in the basement and when you open the door to the basement you are hit with a terrible smell that is a mix between kitchen grease and garbage. 
The bathrooms were in the same state of repair as the rest of the restaurant.
The bottom line, was my food arrived and I couldn't help but wonder if the food preparation areas are in the same dingy state of repair. I had lost my appetite.
I can't fairly comment on the food. Regardless, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Wow, all kinds of wrong! Decided to splurge with a weekend breakfast on a weekday, why not, you only live once. We arrive around 10 am, me and my dad. Restaurant was empty, told to sit wherever we like, perused the menu and after 5-10 minutes still no sign of the server so I got up to ask for coffees and water. This seemed to be the catalyst for the server to become defensive, that's fine, I have dealt with many people in the service industry who do not understand what customer service really means. We order, me getting the sinful eggs benedict. Well, what can I say, the hollandaise sauce smelled like turkey gravy, server assured me it was homemade with butter, it tasted like a roux base for gravy, no 
lemon juice, no nice bright yellow colour, tasted like gravy with same brown runny consistency. Truly not edible if your palette was awaiting that bright tangy flavour. Unfortunately I decided to return the dish, which I do not like to do in general but gravy was not going to go down this early in the morning.  After changing my order to a monte cristo on rye I noticed a friend standing outside and went out to say hi, the server followed me out of the establishment to confirm that the bread I wanted was rye, I said yes and she had to add \" just making sure because you are so picky\". Well, that did it for me, I was insulted and still hungry so I cancelled the sandwich and asked for the bill. Well, that was her undoing, she lost it, saying it was rude of me to get up and ask for coffee when we first got there, hello, this is a diner, you should be asked if you want coffee as soon as you come in, in my opinion, she started ranting so I got up to leave, that's when she scurried away asking another staff member to call the cops because I was being hostile. I have 
to say I was floored, utterly unbelievable. I got a half ass apology from the other staff member but our server was at the back of the diner complaining about us to the only other patrons in the diner. Ok, back to the food, my dads bacon and eggs were ok, he found a square inch chunk of onion and asked me to help him identify what it was since there was only one on his plate, server was still on the defensive saying they had just opened that is why there was no coffee made (when I came on Yelp to write this review I noticed their hours are from 8 am), 2 hours opened and no coffee on.  Also, coffee cup had coffee grounds in the mug, yuck.
All in all a horrible dining experience and grounds to never eat here again. Such a shame as I love their banana bread french toast on the weekends but there are better establishments that deserve your patronage. Also, there seem to be 2 Wimpys diners with the same address so I guess I will post this review to both Wimpys on the Danforth and Wimpys Diner."}
{"text":"We love the 50s diner decor and booths. Priced very reasonably especially for seniors who get free coffee with breakfast. Wife and I eat here for $11.00 plus tip. Not bad these days.
Friendly staff and no hassle if you ask for hardboiled eggs (getting rare)."}
{"text":"I literally live around the corner and have been eating here for most of my 22 years so I have eaten most of the food on the menu. Most of it is pretty good although they do have their off days..I've had the roast beef dinner and it's been pure fat but my boyfriend has gotten the roast pork dinner and it's delicious and almost pulled pork tender. Other than my minor quips with inconsistency it's a good place to go if your feeling like something greasy. 
The burgers (although they used to be bigger) are huge drooping over the sides and if you order cheese they don't skimp. The poutine is standard but huge and yummy. They have great breakfasts (which are served all day) and have the nice crisp on the outside of the home fries which I sometimes dream about. 
They always have great specials which give you massive portions, last time I went for breakfast they had BANANA BREAD FRENCH TOAST with \"english cream\" (whatever that is, but it was DAMN GOOD - similar to custard but not as thick and sweet) with fresh fruit. 
The management has changed but it seems like he cares more about his customers and always says hi, the waitresses are pleasent also, seems like a good work dynamic. 
Go if your digging some good diner food."}
{"text":"I like the staff here and I also really like the food,
Their eggs benedict is really good!"}
{"text":"It's a cozy little place. I love the feel of it, with jukeboxes on the wall and old style diner tables it's like a blast from the past. The staff is nice and the food is alright. I would say it's a little overprice for what they offer but certainly still worth a trip."}
{"text":"Breakfast with 3 friends at 9:30 on a Monday morning.  Pretty standard breakfast special.

Pro;

Cheap and clean.

Cons;

- 3 eggs, but tiny.  Friend #1 wondered if they might be pigeon eggs.
- Friend #2 took a chance on turkey bacon and was disappointed.
- Friend #3 hated the music.  (Smooth jazz?)
- boring \"Wonder\" style toast.
- Server was slow on the coffee.

We won't be rushing back.  Or even sauntering slowly."}
{"text":"Wimpys burgers are great  only drawback is buns turn  to mush.Good fies not undercooked. Good Service."}
{"text":"We've come here several times since moving back to T.O.! and have never been disappointed. The menu here doesn't differ from most of the other \"WIMPY'S\" as well as the cost, say around $30.00 tip included! This is for two. And the portions are more than generous and worth the price. As for why we keep coming back here, time after time, it's for the service. Always accurate, always prompt, always happy and they always know who you are! We both had the \"Ultimate Club\" which as an extra comes with a honk'in piece of ham on the sandwich plus shredded cheddar cheese as oppose to a slice of regular processed cheese and a generous MOUND of fries w.gravy and coleslaw (EWWWWW!) sorry that's just me! Many a place can learn about this PROPER way to make a Club! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love Wimpy's diner.  I love diners to begin with, but Wimpy's is my fave.  It's nearby, so we go there at least once a week.  Service is friendly, food is good comforting diner food, prices are right.  Everybody should have a neighbourhood place that feels like home."}
{"text":"I ordered for the first time and had Salmon and Steak. The Salmon was a tad bit dry but it was okay. The steak was cooked great but wish it had some more seasoning. The mashed potatoes were great. Would order from here again as I want to give them more chances as they have quite a bit to order :)"}
{"text":"Wimpy's seems to consistently take their time with greeting you and taking your order but they are classic diner food and their prices are fair. My favourite aspect of this location was the beautiful fish tank they have set up to replicate the tank in Finding Nemo complete with Nemo and Dory and all. Seems to be a nice light-hearted environment to grab a heavy greasy diner quality meal (as long as your not in a hurry!)"}
{"text":"Wimpy's Diner chain is based on the original location in Thornhill"}
{"text":"So Wimpys was originally on my list because of tjat 10 oz burger but today i wasny in mood for that much food. Hear they were also know for their breakfast so that whwre i went

Had the twist combo whixg is 3 eggs. 2 peice of sausage and two peice of bacon and home fries and toast. The food was good. Even the home fries which usuallu is meh. Eggs were good right. Bacon was crsipy and sausage was good.

Only grip is that they didn't really check on anyone not even mr while I was there"}
{"text":"For a standard, greasy breakfast with the option to add a chocolate chip pancake or three, you can't really do better than Wimpy's on the Danforth. 

And I should know, because I am a serial bruncher. I've tried each and every brunch offering on the Danforth and Wimpy's is a great quick grab, traditional breakfast fare, no frills. It also happens to be decorated in the likes of a 1950's diner, so there is some kitsch appeal as well. 

I have had the same server many times, and she is super-nice and accommodating. Small quarters make it difficult to navigate this place with a stroller and it's definitely not accessible otherwise (i.e. there are two or three stairs and no way around them, other than to climb them) so if that's an issue for you,  I suspect you can't go here. 

It's next door to Messini, which is a whole other entity unto itself and apparently a Danforth institution, which I just don't really get. Details to follow. 

But Wimpy's is cheap, fresh and normal. And sometimes that's what you want when you're all foie gras'd out."}
{"text":"Always enjoy eating here with the Family. Actually shared my first meal here with my Wife before we became an item so very nostalgic for us.
  I have not had the giant sized burger here but we do the all day breakfasts and never disappointed... sometimes call it in and pick up"}
{"text":"Never fails to please the diner itch and craving in you. You get that burger fix with that massive patty and a good strawberry milkshake to pair it with."}
{"text":"I really wasn't sure what to expect. I've seen many Wimpys Diners everywhere, but never took a minute to check out their website/menus. My hubby tried them out recently at a different location. He really enjoyed his meal, so suggested we stop in for lunch last week when we were in the area.

It is located in small plaza just off Ellesmere near Pharmacy. I wasn't expecting a modern decor restaurant. It is what it is, a small diner. The decor is old school movie posters and prints covering the walls with mostly booths for seating. It was fairly busy when we arrived, but there was 1 booth available for us and we were seated immediately and given menus. First thing we did was order something to drink because i needed some time to check out their menu and burger options. The server brought our drinks to the table and practically dropped them on the table with a loud thud. She wasn't the happiest or most pleasant server. 

They had a few different specials along the wall, but we decided to order straight from the menu. I couldn't bring myself to order the large burger. Something about that burger patty that was twice the size of the bun turned off my appetite from it. I chose the jr version which fit right onto the bun. I added a drink & side of fries and gravy. My combo in total was just under $10.00. I have to admit, i did enjoy the burger more than i thought i would. It was fresh off the grill & juicy. The toppings were very small on the bun.1 slice of tomato, a line of mayo and a small leaf of lettuce, but the taste of the burger patty really made up for it. It's one of those burgers where you can eat it with nothing on it and it would still taste good! I really enjoyed the fries & gravy - classic diner food. Service improved a bit once our food started arriving and the restaurant started clearing out. To be fair i would've rated them 3.5 stars.

I would definitely try out a Wimpys Diner again  to try out items from their breakfast menu - which has many great options."}
{"text":"A cozy place to have delicious diner food near the beaches on Kingston !!! Staff is always welcoming and the service is always with a smile and excellent . A great place for family breakfast or brunch ."}
{"text":"First off the waitress here is so sweet and really great with her customers. We have visited many times and she seems to be the only waitress here. She is great however when it gets busy service really lacks since she is the only one which isn't her fault. I think during the busy period they need a second waiter for sure. 

The food is usually great, comfort diner style eats. The only thing we have ordered twice and disliked both times is the souvlaki. We ordered chicken and pork twice and both times it has been very very dry! 

However, Fish and chips are great, burgers are great, and the sandwiches and wraps are great too! 

All in all it is a great place to eat but avoid busy periods since there is one waitress and wait times for food, drinks and the bill can take a long time!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been to a Wimpy's in years so when I saw the sign decided to stop in.
Initially thought I get a burger, but the Philly Beef sounded to good to pass up.
It was really good, fries was also good.  Nothing spectacular but good, filling food served by really nice people.  The kind of place you wouldn't mind being a regular."}
{"text":"The only reason why we went here was b/c Messini was having some kitchen trouble. Otherwise, I don't think I would have ever tried Wimpy's.

FOOD
The food was better than I expected! I had the BLT with coleslaw.  It was tasty but nothing to rave about.

ENVIRONMENT
The decor was really neat except I was freezing cold in the place. We weren't even sitting by the window. Turn up the heat!

STAFF
I kind of found the waitress to be a bit odd. She didn't seem too friendly. Maybe she was having a bad day.

She did mix up my friend's order and I don't think she apologized for that. She made up some silly excuse.

And then she broke a glass cup on our table and glass shattered everywhere.   Mistakes happen...I know...But I don't think she apologized there either."}
{"text":"This place always gets my vote!  It is usually pretty busy, so be prepared for a small wait...usually 10 minutes on weekends.  The food is extremely reasonably priced for it being made on the spot and not coming in pre-made (besides the pies).  The service is usually quite good...in fact some of the best I have experienced thus far in Toronto.  The food is not the best...but it is good and filling.  I don't think that I have ever left with a dissatisfied feeling.  My favorite thing to eat....the pancakes!  The only negative about this place is that it is not bigger...but other than that I will continue to frequent this location."}
{"text":"I went here recently and thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I wasn't expecting to like it, really - I can't tell you why but I was a bit apprehensive about setting foot in here. 

Once I entered through the doors, our very friendly server seated us and gave us menus. I didn't realize the Wimpy's menu would be so big - and lots of items appealed to me, especially on the breakfast menu. This isn't just your bacon and eggs. Crepes filled with fresh fruit, orange pecan frech toast.. tons of options. I ended up going for the veggie burger and onion rings though - I wasn't disappointed with my choice, it was delicious. I'm just still thinking about how awesome that french toast might have been. 

Its worth noting that their gravy is pretty awesome, too. 

I was also very impressed by the coke in glass bottles! 

Wimpy's trumps Johnny Rocket's as far as diner chains in Toronto go."}
{"text":"This is another Wimpy's I frequent. I usually find myself here on a Sunday after 4pm, because that's when the one closer to me closes. The food is great, the staff is always super friendly and attentive. Fairly quiet location."}
{"text":"How happy was I to find such a charming little place close to where I live (the great restaurants on the Danforth Ave are a little far to simple walk to and north it's a bunch of cookie cutter Kelsey type restaurants). 
First the decor is what makes this place. Maybe it is a little rundown as another reviewer said but to me that just adds to the charms. I love the 50's stlye and the metal-old-store signs everywhere. It just feels cozy as soon as you walk in.
The food was good. It has a basic diner menu which perfect for brunch. This isn't a place you go for exotic tastes but yummy comfort food.
As soon as we walked in and found saw a pack place I knew I would enjoy my experience and will be going back many Sundays to come."}
{"text":"I loved their bacon cheese burgers and their chicken wings, I still want to come back to try other meals because they can really fill your stomach. Wonderful friendly staff and the decor is so random it's awesome. And the prices are ok."}
{"text":"Wimpy's burgers are heart-stopping yet orgasmic! Although for some reason, the location on the Danforth wants me to pay an extra 40% for their food. There are several Wimpy's throughout the city, and they all have amazing food, at considerably smaller prices than the danforth."}
{"text":"You can snag fairly standard diner fare at this chain restaurant. There's not much to say about the food - it does the trick and all-day breakfast is indeed satisfying. The most negative thing I can say about it is that they don't use Heinz ketchup, which IMO should be illegal. As in, if a restaurant is found to be using any ketchup product that's not Heinz, DineSafe should award them a conditional pass till they remedy the situation.

The thing that puts this place over the edge, however, is the fact that they carry bottled, corn syrup-free (kosher) Coke. I have never seen glass bottled Coke anywhere else in Toronto and the manager confirmed its rarity to me. You can enjoy one with your meal or buy 6 bottles to go for $15."}
