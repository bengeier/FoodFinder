{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend and her cousin to grab a quick bite to eat, and really loved this place.  Its like wild wings, only more laid back and with much better wings. You have your choice between naked or breaded, and they use rooster wings, not chicken wings, so they're gigantic!!  BBQ and Honey Mustard was the poison I chose, and not a single one made it home that day.......  I highly recommend this place for wings, trust me, you'll love it.  The best wings I've had so far."}
{"text":"Self proclaimed wing connoisseur (trust me I know a good wing) and House of Wings is doing it right. Big meaty wings cooked to a crispy perfection then drenched with a variety of unique but delicious sauces. Definitely worth a trip here"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Apparently they are shutting this location down. I'm so sad. This place was the bomb! Tomorrow will be their last day. Personal favorite: Hot roman Cesar"}
