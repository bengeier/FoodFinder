{"text":"The food has no taste. Very bland. The guacamole has parm cheese on top and is creamy. The fajitas were covered in cheese. There was no taste!"}
{"text":"go to another place. This is not worth the money you'll pay. I wonder how they are still open. they have the WORST service in Montreal. Have tried there 3-4 times, at night, being so close to home, but finally gave it up. the food is overpriced and not great. I had an enchilada in which the chicken was bland, all covered with a regular supermarket type sauce. it was cold and had to be returned. Not worthy 20 dollars at all. Besides the food issues, they have the WORST service in Montréal. Always slow and it seems like there's always an excuse for the lazy service - either they are short on people or they blame the weather (in Montreal of all places!) as an excuse for \"not expecting a lot of people that night\"."}
{"text":"Mango in salad still frozen. Cactus in salad from a can and briny. Received my ap at same time as friend's main, my main came 10 minutes later. Slow but enthusiastic service. Clearly passionate about authentic Mexican; small store with Mexican products onsite. Overpriced. Left annoyed."}
{"text":"I had brunch here, and the most delicious chilaquiles I have ever eaten.  Great coffee, great juice, and the sandwiches are also delicious.  I love the service and the atmosphere, it is incredibly friendly and warm.    A few of our friends from Mexico city brought us here, and it also has epicerie upstairs with some of their favorite comfort foods.  A must try."}
{"text":"Nice find based on a local tip. We're very accommodating to vegetarians. Great Mexican food"}
{"text":"Good quality food,  unfortunately the service was lacking. Our waiter was surprised that I wanted a second drink.  I actually had to call him over because the empty glad on the edge of the table didn't catch his attention."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, if only they paid more attention. My cactus salad... came as the mango salad, which had mango so cold that it was almost frozen. It was one of two mishaps because the waiter was just not paying enough attention to the order.   On the other hand the food was quite tasty (except that mango) and they certainly served up more than enough food. Which is surprising, because usually when you order a shrimp dish they often don't serve enough. Considering how difficult it is to find even passable Mexican food in Montreal, this is a nice choice and tasty."}
{"text":"We went there in a very particular mood, as we were visiting a dying relative at Notre-Dame hospital. We just walked aimlessly until we spotted this cozy looking restaurant.  I had a tortilla soup, which was very tasty and the chicharrons were very good. As a main dish, my chicken burritos was well garnished and satisfying. Overall, the experience was great, service was stellar (it was middle of the afternoon and only a handful of patrons were there) and the price was modest. Very good value and I would definitely go back if I happen to be in the area again."}
{"text":"Belle place pour aller bruncher ! La bouffe était très bonne, le prix raisonnable, la terrasse est magnifiquement ensoleillée. Toutefois, un bémol quand même important : le service.   ... très ordinaire. Lorsqu'on demande un menu après presque 1h d'attente pour avoir une table, on nous répond nonchalamment de regarder l'ardoise. Comme ce n'est pas un menu ' typique ' de brunch, ce n'est pas si facile de s'imaginer ce qui se trouvera dans notre assiette. Pas d'explications sur les choix à moins de demander, et c'est presque si la serveuse roule des  yeux lors de notre demande. Une de mes soeurs ose demander s'il y a autre chose que les 3 choix, la serveuse nous répond que '' vous savez, tout est fait localement, sur place, on ne sait pas ce qui est disponible à l'avance (et autres commentaires un peu désobligeants)'' au lieu de simplement répondre que non.  Le service est très long, pas d'ustensiles sur les tables , on ne nous a pas offert à boire.. vraiment j'étais déçue !   À travailler de ce côté là, car malgré la bonne qualité de la nourriture l'expérience est grandement affectée."}
{"text":"Been a few times for lunch. Also once ordered for ten people once and they delivered to our office. Everyone liked it. I like their sopa de tortilla the most. I've had better 3 leches cake  but it still hit the spot. The food is definitely Mexican; none of that tex-mex crap. I always grab some items at their little Mexican grocery store upstairs. Provecho!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place for brunch on our way to the village. Very pleasantly surprised by delicious fresh ingredients and great Mexican flavours! Plus anything with guacamole for breakfast has me sold!! Had a nice little terrasse in front. Highly recommend if you are in the mood for something different for brunch. We had great service- lots of vegetarian choices. Will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"There was no English menu, only french. Not cool. All the waiters speak Spanish and English too. It was a confusing scenario but its all good, i safely went with the quesadillas which tasted just fine. Plated very nicely with a salad and everything tasted great. I also had the tortilla soup which had nice flavor and not overly spicy. I liked the outdoor seating, definitely too hot inside. Not sure if they have air conditioning."}
{"text":"Pour une gastronomie typiquement mexicaine. J'y suis allée à 2 reprises.  Le menu dégustation vaut vraiment la peine tout comme le brunch. Les huevos  avec des épinards avec sauce aux fèves noires et chorizo et les rêpes cajeta  au dulce de leche sont mes coups de coeur"}
{"text":"Walking in the village on this beautifully sunny day I stumble upon this mexican place. One look at the menu I saw an inviting brunch burrito I has to try. Staff is charming and discrete. The decor is nice with real plants and not over poweringly latin like some chain restaurant I will not name.  The brunch menu offers coffee \"à volonté\" and a small glass of orange juice. There is also a fruit salad presented in a wine glass an elegant touch. Unlike most breakfast place who serve fruit more as garnish than part of the meal the fruit salad was excellent and all fruit were perfectly ripe.   I choose the mexican egg burito and it was delicious. The plate was beautiful. The guacamole was also very good and tasted freshly made. The nachos with the green and red salsa was a nice surprise.  I will most likely come back and try their regular menu.   Sunday pack on the street is free till 1pm"}
{"text":"Excellent brunch place! For 15$, I got a plate of veracruzana eggs: corn tortilla, scrambled eggs, black beans sauce, pico de gallo, chili sauce, guacamole and chips. This was simple yet delicious. It came also with tea or coffee, fresh pressed orange juice and fresh fruits. They even have a small shop for traditional Mexican candies. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Ouvert depuis 8 ans, ce petit resto tres bien decore avec un menu tres interessant et pas trop cher, est a essayer. Mais pourquoi 3 etoiles?   Service: tres lent et malgré qu'ils sont tres tres gentils un peu deficiant. Ils oublient des choses.  Nourriture: assez authentique, le gout et les epices sont la. Par contre, la cuisson des viandes laissent a desirer. Le porc super sec et le boeuf pas assez tendre. Par ailleurs, ca manquait d'accompagnements, de corriandre...meme si les sauces avec la viande etait tres bonne!   Decors: tres bonne ambiance, belle terrasse, propre et beau...rien a dire.  Malgré le 3 etoiles, j'y retournerais pour essayer autre chose que le menu pour 2. Je pense qu'ils meritent une 2e chance."}
{"text":"I actually got a little excited when I spotted a new place that serves up Mexican/South American cuisine in a city that is sorely lacking such establishments.  The entrance is situated between floors, head upstairs to visit a small deli (with bakery) that sells a few specialty food items from South America.  Restaurant seating, at least for dinner, is downstairs though I suppose you could opt for the bar stools in the window if being on display is your thing.   They really nailed the menu with a dinner set for two that includes one soup, one salad, an appetizer, and a small portion of three different mains for about $45 with tips and taxes.  We were worried that there wouldn't be enough food, it turned out to be more food than we could finish.  The tortilla soup got us off to a rough start, I'm not an expert, but the thick and crunchy tortilla chips were taking a tepid bath in some tomato based dish water.  The mango salad came with a great portion of fresh greens and was loaded with semi-defrosted mangoes straight from Costco. Next up were some little beef taquitos served with a nice creamy guacamole.  The main course arrived on a tray with three bowls, one of chicken mole, one of spicy beef, and bowl of guacamole shrimp.  After a short wait the waiter did bring us a scoop of rice and a small stack of tortillas.  The mains were great.  The mole was rich but maybe a touch too sweet, the beef was tender and spicy, and they didn't skimp on the shrimp.  Sadly they nuked the tortilla shells just before serving them.   I liked the concept and some of the food, but so disappointed that they cut corners.  I want to like this place and I want to go back but the watery soup, frozen mangoes, and nuked tortillas really make it hard for me to justify a meal that costs more than $20 per person."}
{"text":"Great cozy Mexican brunch spot in the Gay Village, very close to Beaudry STM station. I came here with my DC on a Sunday during peak brunch time and we managed to get a table. The dining room is small, but there are extra tables downstairs. There was only one server and the food took a while to come out, but I think it was because there was a larger group (6 people) that had just placed their orders ahead of us.   The space is airy and bright, and they sell some Mexican grocery items like tortillas and salsa too. The food was delicious and authentic, reminding me of trips to Mexico (they have chilaquiles -- a classic breakfast item!). All brunch dishes come with coffee, juice, and a fruit salad -- a nice touch. I had the huevos a la veracruzana -- scrambled eggs and chorizo in a tortilla smoothered in a hearty black bean sauce. It was filling and tasty. Not spicy at all, but they can bring you a good habanero sauce if you ask. It came with some sliced plantain and guacamole. My DC had the huevos a la casuela which comes with tortillas on the side and a small casserole dish with eggs and veggies, so you can make your own mini breakfast burrito type things. It looked delicious! Most dishes are around $14-15, pretty reasonable for what you get.   This is a nice option for a non-traditional brunch!"}
{"text":"Un endroit relax pour une cuisine mexicaine authentique.   C'est un restaurant boutique où vous pouvez acheter plusieurs produits importés directement du Mexique.   Le service est bien. Les plats sont bons. Les prix raisonnables."}
{"text":"Chill (but expensive and slow). I went here for brunch one Sunday. Had seats outside so that was nice. The food was good and the coffee is free with free reffils, which is nice. Like other Montreal restaurants it can be pricey, and the service is slow."}
{"text":"Having moved recently from Texas, I had to be bullied into going here. I'm glad I was. Less mainstream Mexican and more Mayan/Yucatan style food, I've been looking for a place like this since I toured Mexico years ago. A more delicate approach to the cuisine with pumpkin seeds, lightly prepared chopped eggs, etc, it may not be for everyone who's used to a bash in the face from their greasy mexi-like post-bar food. Had some fantastic soup, some great enchiladas and will be back."}
{"text":"Bon petit restaurant mexicain situé dans le village. Le midi un menu fixe est proposé avec une entrée (soupe ou salade) et un plat principal (choix de poulet, buf ou végétarien). Nous avons payé près de 19$ (taxes et pourboire compris). Le prix est correct et les plats sont savoureux, particulièrement le plat végétarien avec du tofu. Moi qui n'aime pas cela habituellement, ils ont su le cuisiner à la perfection pour qu'il soit goûteux. Le poulet, selon mon amie, était un peu sec. Profitez de la terrasse, elle est charmante, quoi que un peu bruyante car elle donne sur la rue Amherst. L'intérieur est tout mignon, tout en couleur. Service agréable, mais j'ai été surprise par la lenteur. Nous étions une table de 6 et il y avait une seule autre table à servir dans la sale à manger. Donc soyez patients et essayez d'avoir une longue pause à midi si vous y allez pour le lunch!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me alot of the mom and pop family restaurants in Mexico.  A taco bell this is not, the dishes taste authentic and all the classics are served."}
{"text":"Ca faisait longtemps que je voulais retourner à ce resto-boutique , je suis contente que la qualité des repas est toujours exellent apres 10ans !! Au sou sol ambiance caverne et en haut ambiance cafeteria."}
