{"text":"We take out from here once in a blue moon. We decided to pick it up and they were ready in about 20 minutes.

We ordered a pork souvlaki and chicken souvlaki dinner. It was more than enough food for 3 adults. However, they took the meat off the kebab sticks, so it was really difficult to see how much we were getting. We were supposed to get 3 pork sticks and 2 chicken, but it looks like we got the opposite. There was way more chicken than pork, which kinda sucked for my parents who wanted to share the pork.

I will say I love the potatoes. The sauce on them is really tasty. But the rice was pretty boring. We also got the greek salad and pita, which were both tasty.

It was nice to have the food, but for the prices they charge, I would expect something nicer and more abundant."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and the service was quick. Now it was a Thursday night, and not at all crowded. They had signs saying there was new management. I would say try it."}
{"text":"Went in late on a Friday night and it wasn't busy so service shouldn't have been as slow as it was. Servers were polite enough but somewhat inattentive, even though we had specified we were in a rush.
Food quality was what you would expect from the mall Mr. Greek but much more expensive.
Atmosphere wasn't much of an upgrade - I would prefer to spend less, get served quicker and eat the same quality of food at the mall food court."}
{"text":"Hard to like the ambiance of a restaurant re-done from a pancake house (I think) but we really had no complaints after having a meal here.  Lamb and pork were cooked to perfection and the accompanying side-orders were generous.  The big K, who can eat way more than I , enjoyed the complimentary garlic  and pita bread. Our waitress seemed a little spacey and perhaps she was literally at the end of her shift because another server took over and even the manager made an appearance.  (This, in a restaurant that was very dead on a Sunday night).  I liked my meal and it certainly wasn't over-priced.   But if you are looking for atmosphere, this place isn't for you."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch and had a great meal. The baked cheese was really good and the service was fast and very pleasant. We will be back."}
{"text":"The Service at this location is horrible. The waiter practically threw our basket of bread at us and had a \"I hate my job\" expression on his face the entire time. Also, do NOT order their Caesar... Not only was there no skewer as advertised on their menu, it was so salty I had to send it back (which was refused). There was no particular order of which food came first. Our bread, appetizer and gyro came all together. The only thing worthy of mentioning is that they give large portions and their gyros are pretty good, not dry at all like some other places. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Clean restaurant. Me and my friend showed up here late at night and were pleasantly surprised. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Horrible. A Greek restaurant run by non Greeks. Food was disgusting. I'm going to report them to Mr. Greek Corporate. They have Indian decor in the restaurant. The moussaka was cold. The orders were mixed up and the souvlaki was three slabs of meat. No resemblance whatsoever to souvlaki. This place is a shame to the name. Stay away."}
{"text":"food so-so. dont get the lamb. undercooked   and mediocre quality  great service thought.  if you want the real stuff you have to go down to the Danforth"}
{"text":"Food is always great, but they always manage to make a mistake on my order in some way, usually forgetting to bring something. Last time I called to complain they told me they would bring it to me soon (they were closing in half hour) and nobody showed up. I called again the next morning to say I never recieved part of the order from last night and had paid for it but they apparently had no idea what I was talking about and refused to compensate me for it."}
{"text":"Impatient, vocal children accompanying you for lunch today (along with your daily headache)? Mr. Greek welcomes them!

Quite a few in your group and you have no reservations?  No problem at Mr. Greek!

We were a group of 8 walking in for lunch on a Saturday AND with children.  But no worries at Mr. Greek.

Service was fair, food arrived at a timely matter and at Mr. Greek standard quality. What more can you ask for when you have 3 children dining with you?"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed and do not recommend this restaurant to anyone. After I spent $60 dollars on food for my family I was very upset when I came home opened up our take out and there was no where near the amount of food you would normally get in ANY greek restaurant. When I called to complain the manager told me that you only get 4 ounces of rice per dinner. I told him I got no where near 4 ounces and every time I get a dinner from any greek restaurant it fills up the take out container. He credited me one dinner and asked me if I wanted to pick it up or save it for another time; I opted to pick it up immediately because my kids were still hungry. When I picked up the dinner he assured me put extra rice in it only to get home and find maybe 4 ounces of rice again! I will never waste my money there  again. That was the first and last. For the amount of food you get vs. how much it costs; it's NOT WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"First the waitress we had was horrible. She took our orders, Then brought the appetizer with our meal. The meals were incorrect as well. The calamari was dripping in grease and lacked taste.  The meals were stale tasting and greasy. When I called her over to complain she proceeded to touch the food on our plates. When I asked to speak with the manager my son caught her picking her nose right in the dining room. I was waiting for cameras to come out telling me I was on candid camera. Worst service. Disgusting food I wouldn't feed to my Dog. Manager could care less. Although he agreed the food looked horrible would not comp the meal. The restaurant itself was filthy. I would say this place is a major health hazard."}
{"text":"Probably the closest thing to Greek in Newmarket. Food is fresh, however tastes like something was lacking in flavour.

Flip side: Went there for a family dinner. Management is nice. Child friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed the mix platter for $40 and even had some left to take home...  Loved the grilled calamari.  The service was pretty good.  The waiter wasn't too enthusiastic but was helpful."}
{"text":"Save your time and money.
How is this restaurant still open? Empty inside so we took it for take out.Very poor customer service, girl at counter was like talking to a 12 year old who mumbled and did not want to be there.
Waited way too long for two gyros and a salad. Meat was very cold. Very bad experience all together."}
{"text":"I'll summarize my experience first - waste of your money and negative experience.
They don't care about customers and their experience at all. Everything was super slow , no one ever asked if food was good ,  if you order grilled jumbo shrimp  expect to get medium sized  shrimp. Food was average . And the worst part this morning - diarrhea. 
So for me , never again ."}
{"text":"4.5* for take out.  Went there late, around 10:30 & ordered chicken and pork souvlaki and hummus with pita.  Brought it home, ate & was delicious & fresh.  GREAT & healthy takeout in Newmarket. I see this place got some bad reviews on help under old management but there are signs at restaurant saying there is new management so give it a try."}
