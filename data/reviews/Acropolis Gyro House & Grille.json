{"text":"Greek salad with chicken - dressing was very bland, chicken just OK.  No cucumbers in the salad despite being listed in the description.  Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Tiropitas were fabulous. Gyros were big but just standard in flavor, not alot of tziki sauce. Greek salad was pretty weak. Not a lot of stuff in it. Add meat, it would be better. The biggest disappointment was the roasted lamb dinner. It tasted like chuck roast. I'm guessing they just cooked gyro meat in an au jus. It lost it's flavor. Plus they forgot the salad that went with that. Check your order before you leave! It's close to our house so we really gave it a good try. Not that impressed. Overall, it was just ok."}
{"text":"Reading the previous reviews I was expecting a bigger gyro. The place wasn't bad and the gyro was average. The owner was there complaining about 2 employees that walked out on him prior to opening today. The girl at the counter was nice and greeted me. It was her first hour of employment. The store was clean."}
{"text":"Ordered a gyro, chicken gyro and fries. Regular gyro was cold.. chicken gyro was sparse at best. Have not been back since esp. since hearing they keep their meat in a warmer which explains the temperature issue. Fries were good."}
{"text":"The food is authentic and delicious.  The Gyro meat was the best I have ever had and I eat a lot of Gyros.  The grape leaves were perfect and the olive oil used was definitely high end.  The really amazing thing is the cost.  I really did not expect gourmet food for such a good price.  The Greek salad was fresh with quality Feta cheese and the dressing was perfect.  I finished my meal (stuffed myself since everything was so yummy) with Baklava.  The Baklava was also fresh and yummy and surprisingly not super sweet.  I highly recommend eating here, the only down side is you may not ever want to eat a Gyro anywhere else."}
{"text":"I live in Verona so I've been here at least 5 times now and I have yet to have anything but an excellent experience. Here are my top likes about this place:

1) The food is awesome. Best Greek food I've had in Pittsburgh. It's the same selection you'd normally get in a Greek restaurant or festival, but everything here is done a little bit better. A little more spice... a little more flavor... it's just done to the next level. 
2) The chef/owner is usually sitting there so you can say hi - he is adorable and loves to talk about his food. What a sweetie!
3) Fast service
4) You can't beat the price
5) I'll say it again - the food is awesome. I just finished leftovers of their lemon soup and I ate it cold because it was still delicious that way! Everything is freshly spiced and seasoned and you can tell.

There is a gyro place in Penn Hills that I thought was pretty decent until Acropolis opened. Now I'd say save the drive and go to Acropolis instead. 

Thanks to Chef Papageorgiou for bringing your delicious food to Verona!"}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic gyros, tons of meat and the sauce is in point. We also had the hummus which was also delicious. Topped it off with the baklava which was easily the best I ever had."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I have been here 4 times and each time my food has been cold and is so greasy the pita is soaked in it. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean but the food is very subpar."}
{"text":"We got gyros for the family to go. We were very excited to try this place and have a great gyro but boy am I disappointed.  Disappointed to the point that I stopped eating to type this review.  The pros: The lamb is well prepared and there is a generous portion of lamb. That is it for the pros.  The cons: the gyro is very dry.  Dry to the point that it is barely edible. There are hardly any tomatoes or cucumber sauce on it.  They also didn't include lettuce even though we asked for everything on it for one gyro and everything except onion on the other.  I am not sure if I will return and give them another shot after this.  It may take me awhile  to get over this first impression."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing, authentic Greek food! Best lamb - fantastic, prepared on the rod authentic style - it simply melts in your mouth. 

Mousaka was outstanding,  with a delicate puffy potato top layer, and tender eggplant topping ground meat. 

Honey balls! Freshly made to order! Great prices on everything too! Wonderful, big portions! I can't wait to come back already, and take all of my friends and clients! Opa!"}
{"text":"It's about time to have a Greek restaurant over that side of the river I have been there many times since they opened and I have tried many things on there menu and everything I have had is very good and I would recommend anything on the menu to anyone the price of the food is wonderful for the amount you get with your order"}
{"text":"Worst service. Young man behind counter was so rude I was shocked.  Mgr. On duty did nothing. I have always liked their food but will not go back after the way I was talked to. I asked the young man his name and he would not give it to me. So sad they will lose business because of an absolute  rude and and arrogant  emplyee."}
{"text":"Top notch quick service Greek food.   Have eaten here multiple times and have yet to be disappointed.  The authentic gyros are definitely not lacking when it comes to having enough meat on them.  And the price is very reasonable, especially for the amount you receive.  The baklava was very good with the honey drizzled on for an after gyro dessert.    The grape leaves have become a necessary side with the gyro as well.  For a new place, very impressed with the progress I have seen from day 1 to now.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant lacks consistency, and a little common sense.  If it had that, I'd give it a four star rating.

     It's hard to tell if the problem is due to management decisions, or just the counter help, but I would venture to say that it is a little of both.

     Coffee and tea are free - great if you can drink caffeine.  Unfortunately, I cannot.  In that case, you must buy bottled water.  I asked for water (which is usually free in a cup), and I was informed that they don't have water (for free), just bottled water.  Before I paid, I inquired about the difference between the water and a soda, preferring to have a soda if I was paying.  Twice.  I guess they don't know how much it costs because I was never told, and had to settle for the water.  Perhaps the soda is just there for decoration.

      The menu on the wall is confusing.  There is an appetizer \"gyro.\"  There is another listing for a \"gyro,\" and a \"gyro platter.\"  I was informed that the gyro platter was the SAME as the gyro, except it was \"deconstructed,\" and it came with a salad, French fries, and tsatziki sauce.  That was fine with me.  My husband ordered the chicken gyro platter.  I asked for an extra sauce, and I was told that it was fifty cents.  Usually it's complimentary, or a quarter, but I said OK.  However, with the two platters and the extra sauce, we were given two dressings.  Apparently only the lamb/beef traditional meat gyro comes with a sauce at all - unless you buy still another one.  At $8.50, you should get a sauce if you like it on chicken.

      I should mention this was a cold, 12 degree day and we were the only customers in the place that day.  The platters came with French fries.  For some reason, my husband's plate had fries on it when the food came out.  Mine did not.  They put that hot food aside, to wait for the fries (in that very cold restaurant).  I said they could bring the fries later.  About 15 minutes later, the fries arrived - the food would have been stone cold.  On those fries, as described in the menu, and in other reviews, there was feta.  On my husband's fries, there was none.  I did ask about this - they just shrugged and said, different people prepared them, I guess.  I guess there should have been.

      The worst part, for me, however, was the fact that the pita bread for the \"deconstructed\" gyro was CUT INTO FOURTHS!!!  I had made it clear that I was going to make a traditional sandwich from the platter - why would they cut the gyro into fourths???  And when I took it back up again and explained how unhappy I was, they said - \"Some people like to eat it as bread in their hand with the platter.\"  We were the only ones there, and I obviously was not happy with it (trying to wrap the meat in tiny fourths of pita bread).  I was not offered a whole piece (but if it was my restaurant, I sure would have done that! - a customer paid nine dollars for a sandwich and I want them to come back and they were told they could make a sandwich but it is impossible....yep, I would have kicked in that bread).  

    Finally, I read in these reviews about how good the salad dressing is.  I wouldn't know - there was absolutely no salad dressing on mine.  

   So - feta on some fries, none on others.  Dressing (apparently) on some salads, none on others.  Sauce with some gyros, none with others.  Bread you can use for a sandwich with some gyros, cut tiny pieces of bread with others.  Free coffee, not water - and they have soda but apparently don't sell it.  As I said above, consistency and common sense is totally lacking.

    That having been said, the food tasted good, which made me more upset that I couldn't enjoy it the way it was presented.  I prefer a properly dressed salad to a big pile of lettuce, even with the Greek olives and roasted red peppers.  How good that would have been with some dressing!  I tried the Spanokopeta - it would have been fantastic had it been more than barely warmer than room temperature.  

    On the way out I inquired how much a piece of pita bread would have cost if they sold it separately.  FIFTY CENTS.  I wish I would have thought to ask that when I was trying to make a sandwich from a cut up pita.  My advice is, make sure you get what you are supposed to, and view the price as a guideline - add a pita, salad dressing and sauce to what you expect to pay.  A few more dollars and you will be able to ENJOY the food."}
{"text":"The first few times we went it was really good. The last few times the food was bad and twice they messed up the order. The lady was not very friendly either. If I was the owner I would of taken my face off the building too!"}
{"text":"I honestly went there only to use the Groupon that I had purchased, but I am sure glad that I did.  I ordered a Gyro combo.  I figured, when in Rome or Greece.  You see what I am doing there.  Anyway, the gyro was on larger portion size.  I couldn't even eat half of it, there was so much going on.  Believe me, i wanted to.  The pita was cooked perfectly and there was the right amount of traditional gyro topping.  

The combo comes with fries and a drink for $8.99 which is a great deal."}
{"text":"I decided to pick up food for our office in RIDC Park. Seriously? I don't understand who's been doing these reviews, friends or relatives of the owners? The food is horrible. For starters, the hummus was too salty. The pita bread tasted stale and was microwaved as opposed to grilled. . The tzaziki didn't even look like tzaziki. It's suppose to have fresh dill and Greek yogurt, I doubt it had either and the color? It was yellow as opposed to white. The chicken on the  kebab tasted old and tastless, and the rice was absolutely nothing to write home about. The chicken lemon orzo soup was nothing in comparison to what I've tasted in the past. And the grape leaves? ooey gooey chewey. And who ever heard of a gyro without lettuce on it? I noticed that the gyro meat sits in a warmer as opposed to being cut fresh every time when a customer orders a gyro....... the baklava was soaked in honey........way too much.  None of my co workers liked it either. the one star was for the order was ready on time and the people were friendly at the restaurant.  I don't think i'll be going back to this place."}
{"text":"Kind of strange that a number of reviews for this place were done within a week of each other by Yelpers with no pictures, no friends and only one review.........here.  Regardless, the food is pretty good.

We stopped in last night for a quick late dinner as it is not far from the house.  I ordered a large Greek salad with chicken, their house made dressing and tzatiki (sp?) and a cup of the lemon orzo soup.  BObby ordered their gyro platter that came with a lamb gyro, fries, and a 20 oz bottle of pop.  We ordered a piece of baklava as well.

My salad was really good. I was concerned that the label said it had been made on Saturday and it was at that point Monday, but it tasted fresh.  The chicken was very tender and seasoned well.  I loved the house dressing - lots and lots of herbs in it gave my salad great flavor.  The soup was good - a large portion for a \"cup\" I requested.  It was very thick and filling.

Bobby loved the gyro. The meat was super tender and thinly sliced.  Pita was grilled fresh.  He asked for sauce on the side and I think the gyro could've included lettuce, but otherwise he had no complaints.  He wasn't a fan of the baklava. I thought the flavor was really good but the consistency was off.  It was too chewy for my liking - and maybe this is because I have had it elsewhere when it literally melted in my mouth.  Either way - it wasn't bad.

There was a young girl waiting on us and another woman behind the counter preparing the food.  The chef/owner (and I know he is the chef/owner because there is about a 10 foot poster of himself on one of the walls inside) seemed friendly but we didn't have much interaction.  There are tables to sit at, but I assume we will use this mostly as a takeout place.

Overall, good food and our bellies were happy.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Large portions and great flavor. I enjoyed the food immensely. The 'famous gyro' was HUGE and delicious. I walked in and ordered takeout and only waited maybe 8 minutes. I will definitely be back! I recommend this place!!! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I love Acropolis! Their cooks are definitely in the graces of the Greek Gods. The portion sizes are very generous and the food is delicious. The dolmades are perfect, they're not squishy, they're perfectly firm to bite into, and they are tasty! 

I definitely recommend giving them a chance!

~

Please note, I just saw that they're under new management as of recent. I haven't tried them since they changed. They just opened less than a year ago, so it's odd they're under new management so recently."}
{"text":"Just tried this little gem of a place today. Saw it a while ago while driving though Verona, PA and decided to give it a whirl! I wasn't disappointed!! I got the Acropolis Combo which is a traditional Gyro w fries and a drink. The gyro was amazing! Been a long time since I found a gyro \"place\" where the meat wasn't rubbery or dried out. The meat was tender and juicy. The portion size wasn't skimpy at ALL. The fries were your typical fries with feta cheese sprinkled on them. Wasn't to write home about but they were tasty. I would recommend giving this place a try. The parking lot was packed with patrons getting take out too when I was there!"}
{"text":"ate here about 2 months ago  wonderful gyros, huge portions, but just notified by Local Flavor that they are closed.  had a coupon to return"}
{"text":"We stopped and decided to get some gyros. They were excellent and were very generously full of meat. The baklava was excellent. The rice pudding was high-quality. The honey balls finished things off quite well. I would recommend stopping in if you're driving by."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place, while picking up our order from Pittsburgh Thai by Boris. Being the gyro connoisseur that I am, I had to stop in and check it out. Let me say that it left a lot to be desired. First off, I'm not a fan of the tomatoes, onions and tzatziki being underneath the meat. It made for a soggy pita, seeing as how they only appeared to be steamed. Second, the tzatziki is entirely too thin and is a tad over-powering. There are just too may herbs, for my taste and it could stand to be a bit thicker. Third, even though it may not be a staple ingredient of an authentic gyro, I think lettuce would be a nice addition. It would add some freshness and crispness to an, otherwise, heavy sandwich and would, also, absorb some of the tzatziki that \"waterlogs\" the pita. Every other place that I've tried around town uses it and it works well. All that negativity aside, there is one positive thing and it is the amount of meat that they give. They charge $6.00 for the traditional gyro, but could easily charge more. 

For my taste, Mike & Tony's is still the gyro king in and around Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I stopped in on a Friday afternoon for lunch. I was amazed at the quality of the food and the reasonable prices. I personally had the #1 combo 1gyro fries and a 20oz soda. The gyro was over stuffed with meat. The fries have fresh feta cheese crumbles on them. The sauce should be on top of the gyro but with the amount of gyro meat you would have to drown the gyro. I suggest asking for a side of the sauce so you can add your own without drowning the meat in the sauce. 
My son and his gf had the 2 gyro combo. OMG 2 gyros for $11 is unbelievable. 

This is a great find and value. Easily the best gyros in town.  I can't wait to go back and try the other items on the menu. 

They are well worth the drive if you are not in the area. Give them a try"}
{"text":"I tried this place twice. The first time I ordered 2 gyros and a kids gyro meal. I attempted to order the fried cheese but was told they don't make that yet. The restaurant itself was very cold and uninviting, the staff seemed unorganized and unsure of what to do. The food was just ok and it was cold. I decided to give it another shot since they are newer, figured they had some quirks to work out... went back about 2 weeks later. The restaurant was still very cold but we did eat inside. We had to keep our huge winter jackets on and it seemed like everyone else eating there had their coats on as well. The staff still seemed very unorganized and unsure of what to do. They were still polite however... This time I ordered salads and pizza's. The salad was good... the pizzas however were not. They were very cold and the staff forgot to put gyro meat on them and the onions. I was also double charged for a drink which I realized after I looked at my receipt when I left. I have most certainly had better greek food and I wouldn't go back to this place. I believe the potential could be there for them but they have a ways to go... First step would be making sure all employees know whats going on. Warm up the restaurant and the food!"}
{"text":"Their gyro was enormous and about 90% meat. Excellent.  It is the only I've had here.  The food was prepared quickly and in a friendly manner.  They have plenty of parking and are within walking distance of the shops including Dirty Harrys infamous bike store and 'Sweet Memories' which is an awesome collectibles store."}
{"text":"Only have tried the Gyro but it was way too salty I couldn't eat it. I was really disappointed as I heard good word of mouth. I might try one more time."}
{"text":"When your visit starts with an order taker who is lethargic and just asks what you want in a tone that says she would rather be anywhere else but taking your order you wonder about what the food will be like. Unfortunately the food was just as disappointing. The hummus was very thin and lacked flavor. The greek salad was flavorless, including the feta, except for the salad dressing that was sweet. My wife's roast lamb gyro had too much fat still on the meat (she had to trim each piece). The sauce on both of our gyro's was skimpy and flavorless. I have never had such flavorless greek food. To make the dining experience complete, they must not have turned on the exhaust fans until we got there as the place smelled of kitchen odors and so did our clothes upon departure."}
{"text":"Average or below.
Living in Oakmont we were excited to see a gyro shop moving into Verona, but quickly were disappointed. We've ordered from there 4 times now. The gyro meat is the same as everywhere, except Acropolis slices it and keeps it in a warmer (who does that?). Better to slice it fresh, as needed, or at least throw it on the flat top before assembling the gyro. The sauce is OK.
The service is mediocre. First time we went we ate in and my lamb platter arrived late. Each time we've been there the serving size was different."}
{"text":"Excellent! Stopped by there today with the Little Man as we were passing through Verona - he's wanted to try it and we both love gyro's. Clean store, and the staff is very friendly. We ordered two gyro's and spanekopeta, and two baklava cheesecakes. We got the food to go. When we got home and opened the gyro's I was almost shocked at how much meat was packed into the pita. Huge! Even better, it was delicious! The homemade gyro sauce is amazing. The spanekopeta was tasty, and the cheesecake was terrific. Oh - and the price was very reasonable...a great deal considering the quality of the food and the big portions!
Oh yeah - this place is gonna be the 1st thought of stop when it's gyro time! Great Greek!"}
{"text":"Maybe I was there on a bad night but the gyro was anything but huge,  my 82 year old mother who can't eat a whole gyro at OVG ate the whole sandwich and was still hungry. The meat was held in a steamer pan until needed and was served at just over room tempature, it definitely  needed to be heated as this is not meant to be served as a cold sandwich. The meat was standard gyro flavor and nothing special. The fries were  served hot and fresh but had no seasonings, they did not even put salt on the fries. I gave it two stars because it was clean and comfortable and even the restrooms were clean. I may try it again but it will not be a destination place to eat, I tried this place because they were reviewed in the MURRYSVILLE MAGAZINE and they had some positive reviews on YELP .  By the way, I did not go there at some strange time, it was  five o'clock on a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"The gyros are HUGE, piled with more savory meat and delicious sauce than I thought I could eat in one sitting! The Greek fries were okay - definitely different, with herbs and feta. The honey balls had the right flavor but were a little dense in texture.

We ordered for pickup, even coming earlier than they said, but our food was still a bit cold. We also were missing one item from our order. I'm hoping these are all kinks that will be worked out since they are still relatively new. We plan to give them another try!"}
{"text":"I ordered a regular gyro to go- I was so disappointed when I got home and found that the only topping on it was onions! No sauce, no lettuce, no tomatoes- just onions. I ate it anyway and the meat itself was very good as was the pita - but it kind of turned me off from trying again. I would if someone else wanted to go."}
