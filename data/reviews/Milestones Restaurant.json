{"text":"Walked in at 7:30 on a Sunday evening to a half full restaurant and nearly bare patio to be told we wouldn't be able to get a table without a reservation!?  WTF! After complaining we were seated,  but it seemed we were not welcome..  The bus boy was choked to have to clear a table for us,  and the server was less than friendly.  We've eaten here before,  but likely this will be our last visit."}
{"text":"The food was honestly so amazing. I had the prime rib burger w/ yam fries. It was vv good. The yam fries was the best. All my family was happy with their meals. The bathroom is very modern but not spotless.  The service was a tad slow. Though very friendly and helpful. Definitely come here for dinner"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times! The food are excellent!! Great costumer service!! I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Calamari is great, fish taco is great the beef slider not with the money 
Service has been good, bartender was great"}
{"text":"Great service and the wobbly pop chicken was delicious.  Will difintely be back to try something different off the menu the next time I'm shopping at Cross Iron Mill."}
{"text":"We go to this Milestones all the time because it's close, sometimes service is good, sometimes it's not that great but the food is usually the same every time which is nice. I recently left my cell phone there & when I went to pick it up, they made sure that I was the rightful owner. In a day & age that Iphones are rarely returned, I am very grateful!!"}
{"text":"Food was great!  The two stars are for the service.  We were a family of four and other than two other couples the restraunt was empty.  It took the waiter 10 minutes to get to us to begin with, he forgot our drinks.  A second waiter asked if we needed anything we told her about the drinks she smiled then walked away and never took care of it.  The prime rib came without sides and when it came 5 me to pay it took another 15 minutes.   The lady waiter was rude and pushy the guy who served us was polite enough but all in all unapologetic for the lousy service.  We won't be back due to the service."}
{"text":"The current tallied rating of only 2.5 stars is being too generous & actually warrants a lower rating. Late & poor cooking & delivery with no excuse of being under-staffed or busy with patrons. Apart from marginal cooked quality, it is obvious that there is poor or non-existing expedition practice to ensure quality of output. Sigh! Manager did not have the perceived courage to approach our table to discuss or get feedback despite waitress prompting (again) not busy. The offer of dessert was distasteful & offer of 10% off the bill is a cop-out to avoid speaking with us. We made sure to return the 10% to the waitress. Make a pass to the restaurant to the left & right or the food court."}
{"text":"Now I remember why we haven't been back for such a long time.
We were taking our mother/grandmother for birthday dinner. 
Host staff was very pleasant and accommodating when we had a couple extra unexpected family show up by moving us to a larger booth.
We ordered drinks which came quickly.  
Appetizers took a while but to be fair, restaurant was very busy. 
Then we waited.......finally 2 of our party of 5 were served their dinners. They politely waited for our dinners to arrive until it became apparent it was taking longer then normal.  Our server did apologize and mentioned something about a confusion with the way the orders went in to kitchen?? 
We did get our food approx 10minutes later. 
My mom sent back her steak because it was med rare not medium! At this time I asked for ranch or some aioli or gravy another person in our party asked for some hot sauce.   When server came back with the steak we had to remind again for hot sauce and he completely forgot about my ranch.
(My husbands soup was cold) he didn't bother mentioning it.
Other then that the food was actually very good.
Server did do a quality check, I'm just wondering if he was so behind why he didn't get help with his tables.
Be aware this is not a quiet restaurant! 
I don't think we will go back."}
{"text":"My husband had a horrible time when he came here once. The prime rib was extremely rare and the vegetables were uncooked so him and his dad sent them back and when they came back to the table they were still raw. 

So I didn't have high hopes for this place but I went at lunch time for a lunch meeting. I saw a few things that look good but decided to go with the garden burger because both my coworkers have had it before and found it very good. They definitely weren't wrong, the burger was really tasty and definitely did not taste like a nasty vegetarian patty. I got it with avocado salsa on it and I definitely don't regret my decision. the bun was really soft but also toasted and the fries on the side were so yummy. I feel like $16 for a vegetarian burger is kind of pricey but the avocado salsa plus a pop, and I still manage to get away for just over $20.00 with tip. 

We found the service to be good and the atmosphere was nice not overly busy. I would give this place another chance but I probably will not ever come back here with my husband because he refuses to eat there! If the Eggs Benedict or breakfast wrap is as good as the one at market mall then I definitely would go back sooner rather than later :)"}
{"text":"Meh....

This could be far better than it was.   It took a little too long to get seated and the wait staff was a little too indifferent.   

We had drinks, which were ok.   We ordered some appetizers, which were fairly poor.    

We had wings, which were passable.  The flatbread was tasty BUT the second piece was still frozen.   We sent it back.  To their credit they removed it from the bill.

We had some mozzarella chorizo balls which tasted like neither.   A lost opportunity.    

If you are rushed for lunch then perhaps this place would suffice as an epicurean pit stop.  Otherwise, there are many better options.  

If anyone operating this location is reading this then I would say that you have a great location that with a decent amount of attention could move to 4 stars.   Attention to detail matters.  Right now you come up well short."}
{"text":"When there before going to the movies and I am glad I did.
I wish I could of given then 5 stars but a few things prevented that.
The service was great and the manager on the floor was beyond friendly.
We started with a few drinks and the Bellini I had was very tasty and looked beautiful. The mojito my friend had could have been a little strong because it was very weak on alcohol.
The onion soup was pretty good but not enough cheese or croutons to be 100%.
We then tried the coconut calamari and they were very rubbery and the coating was not crispy at all but the dipping sauce was amazing.
We shared the Thai Basil noodle bowl and it was so good the only thing is the noodles were a little undercooked.
We had a great night and I would go back again for sure."}
{"text":"I am not really a fan of franchises but hey, It was $5 off bottles of wine and I was in the mood for some grapes! 

We settled into a cute little curtained half booth in the lounge and perused the menu.. 
 
We decided to go with the Mediterranean bruschetta (it was served on top of flatbread which I wasn't too fond of but it did taste great) goat cheese & slow roasted garlic which came with flatbread and some fig jam..  this was a nice presentation and had great flavour and the chorizo cheese fritters... I wasn't a huge fan of these - when I bit into them they were still coldish inside and greasy on the outside.

The experience was nice and our waitress was sweet, I'm not sure I'd be rushing back but for what we had it was good."}
{"text":"I visited on Saturday (04/07 @ 1:39pm) with a table of 6; I haven't been to Milestones in years and I remember why... The service was terrible and slow, plus food was just alright.

We ordered appetizers and a few of the other ladies waited until 2pm to order happy hour beverages. We told our server of our intentions and but after ordering apps, he didn't come back until 2:15 to see if we still wanted drinks. 

Food took awhile to come out too, and it the ladies running the dishes had no idea where the food was going (isn't that what seat numbers are for?)

I'll stick to other large fracnhies."}
{"text":"The service is outstanding and the food is pretty decent! Best and healthiest kids menu in Calgary! Great place to chill, eat and have a nice conversation"}
{"text":"Who serves a Mojito without ice and doesn't even notice it? Watered down horse radish Cesar & bolognese pasta that my dogs wouldn't even eat. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Since we had plans to check out a new movie at Cineplex Crossiron mills, we decided on a quick sit-down dinner before heading into the theatre.  Milestones seems like a good choice for something general that fit everyone's tastes.

Atmosphere:  3.5/5  Overall met my expectations for a Milestones restaurant - clean and modern.  There were a few tables already but we were seated quickly.  We did end up getting a corner table though - which I didn't mind but could be a little cramped for some others.  It was nice for privacy though.

Food: 3/5  I had the beef bolognese which came w a house sauce, a few filets, spinach, on fettucine.  Overall it was okay; I tend to like food that is a little more bland so it was still a little saucy for me.  The plate didn't look too big to start with, but it ended up being filling enough.

Service: 3/5 Our server was new so she had to clarify a few items, otherwise friendly. However, the kitchen did take a while to prepare our meals.  

Price: 3/5  The price was quite $ for the amount and type of food that I had, but I suppose it is only once in a while!

Overall: 3/5  Overall this restaurant met my expectations for a milestones chain, although it was quite expensive for the dish I had.  However, it was nice to have a sit-down dinner in crossiron mills mall instead of grabbing food quickly from the food court, as there are only a few restaurant options available."}
{"text":"The new tuna shushi plate looks great but doesn't work. The short grain rice was a poor choice it has no depth and no texture. 
The hot peppers over power everything. There was wasabi on the plate already!!??

Otherwise a favorite lunch stop when we shop Southcentre mall. 

Comfortable, great service and somewhat quiet. 

Love it!!"}
{"text":"What is with the kitchen speed here? Ordered only a few appies and it takes an hour to come out?  Good thoughts by we came here plenty early before the movie. Have to try somewhere else next time"}
{"text":"Avoid at all cost, by all cost I mean you'll spend more money than the food is worth. The drinks have more ice than liquids, the food is very greasy and under-seasoned. 

The service is extremely slow. Friendly-ish but slow.  This is my second time going, thinking I'd give them a second chance our first time wasn't any better. 

There are far better restaurants than milestone in crossiron, just keep walking not worth the money."}
{"text":"We like this Milestones for the most part as we do not have to sit in the inner Mall style one like at Market Mall and we can avoid the bustle and shorter menu of the downtown location where they do strive to get you in and out to turn the tables over more quickly. Service was OK on this date - the server was absent for a good 10-15 min when we first were seated and he apologized and admitted he had been eating his lunch. We believed him as he was still chomping his last bite when he got to our table. He was friendly though. A bit forgetful and of course curt once our bill was paid but whatever.
For a chain, the food is not too bad. The portobello chicken with pasta was recommended to me by our server so I went with this. It was a 6 out of 10 at best - it was just OK. Nothing I couldn't have made myself at home in 20 min and the bland pasta was borderline overcooked. The plate needed a tiny hint of sweet somewhere (maybe a little honey glaze on the carrots?) It was extremely earthy but not a bad lunch. I ended up taking half of it home. The chicken was cooked well, not a lot of mushroom though. $20 plate.
Hubby's burger - he gave it an 8 out of 10 - cannot go too wrong with a burger, right? He subbed the fries for yam frites and they came out the way he liked them, thin and crispy. $14 plate.
We skipped dessert and the bill was thankfully cut a little in our favor as we had a gift card. 
Will be a while before we go back as there are just so many other restaurant choices in Calgary."}
{"text":"Went to milestones for brunch on new years day and was not impressed at all. My scrambled eggs were more like chopped up burnt omlette, my sossage and ham were dry, and the French toast lacked any real flavour. It isn't that difficult to make good scrambled eggs and a decent brunch, but the feeling I got was that the chef really didn't care about what he is putting out. I will definately not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has a bad wrap and I am actually happy that my co worker doesn't live and die by yelp or I never would have eaten here. Sure beat the food court meals I had been having. 

We thoroughly enjoyed the service and our food. A little bit on the pricey side for a chain attached to a mall, but there aren't many other options and this place serves up a decent, fresh and flavorful meal.  My only gripe really is that their menu lacks a choice of vegetable sides, but to be fair...there's a generous helping of veggies incorporated to may of the entree options, so I guess there really is no need. But, hey...sometimes you just want some extra greens...just sayin'"}
{"text":"Sorry not a big fan
The service was great, and the food was ok, but it just seemed to much. Like i was paying25 for a 15 dollar meal. \"Oh this salad has fresh quinoa, mandarin oranges, ginger sesame oil with just a splash of balsamic virgin olive oil. Goes great with our fresh steak seasoned in blahblahblah...\" Just gimme a garden salad with steak.
I realize that if thats all I want I can just go to a place that just does that. I am just giving my opinion.
That being said I do enjoy going for fancy frufru drinks with my female coworkers there
*side note* Yelp wanted to know if there are any pokestops near by, and if thats a selling feature for you their are 2. GOD SPEED!"}
{"text":"Avoid, avoid, avoid! Absolutely terrible!! Came here on good Friday, they had two girls running the door (one would have been adequate since they were obviously understaffed) we waited for 20 minutes even though there were loads of tables available. The really annoying part of that was there were people who came in after us who got seated before us, not sure what way they were doing the buzzers. After we finally got seated the waitress did try her best to be as quick as she could with everything, however with the drinks they took at least 15 minutes since there was no one running the bar. We ordered the New Mexican starter which was okay, too much cheese in it though. We also ordered the tuna poke which was so disappointing, it had absolutely no flavour and the pineapple did not go with it at all! I have nothing good to say about this place, I definitely wouldn't waste my money on this chain again! Tip - go to Fionn MacCools next door!"}
{"text":"Milestones is always a consistent experience. 

Chain is part of Montana's, Swiss Chalet and Kelsey's. 

Staff very friendly and large size restaurant with many booths and family friendly. 

There are also a bar side and a patio for summer. 

Menu changes frequently and pricing is fair value. Brunch is my fav at this place with a wide range of eggs benny to French toast to omelettes to traditional breakfast. 

Overall great price and service. Can't go wrong here!!"}
{"text":"So we came here fairly bright and early on a Saturday and it was quiet. After waiting a brief moment for a host, we were seated in the lounge. When it came to ordering they were out of calamari and flatbread so two of my counterparts couldn't order what they wanted. It wasn't the end of the world but 'twas a shame!

Like normal I tried a burger, it was the California Burger. I got it because it came with candied bacon, not sure if they were out of that or not but the bacon on the burger was just regularly smoked bacon. It wasn't the greatest and the gravy tasted like it came from a package. Overall it was alright though. The fries were indeed amazing though! Perfect salt and crunch to it! 

Since my wife couldn't get her bruschetta flatbread, she settled for Asian Chicken Bites. They had a lot of meat to them, which is good, but not much crunch. Plating was very odd and had a lot of empty space. Made the dish seem a lot smaller than it should. 

Decent experience though, Dennis the waiter did a good job though!"}
{"text":"Went for our anniversary this past Sunday. I met hubby there and he had chosen a patio table. We were the only ones on the patio and it was moderately busy inside.
Our server was efficient in taking my drink order but waiting for it was another story. It took 15-20 mins just to get my drink. She also forgot our waters at first. Hubby told me he had been waiting a while for his initial drink too.
We ordered food when she came back with the drinks - anticipating that it may be a wait (maybe because we were on the patio). We were right, we waited another 45 mins or so for our food (and no check back on the drinks). When food finally arrived, I ordered a glass of wine to go with my meal (was hesitant because of how slow things were going at this point) but my wine arrived quickly. Hubby ordered another drink, and she brought the food wrong one. 
Food was delicious. Staff was nice but no apologies for wait time.
When she came back to check how food was (as it took another 20 mins or so for her to come back), we asked for the bill. 
Waiting another 20 mins for THAT, hubby had had enough and went inside to get the bill. We had to ask the hostess as our server wasn't anywhere to be seen.
She grabbed the bill and as I was paying, she left to seat someone. I stood there with the debit machine for probably another 5 mins. I was done at this point too - we left the paid debit receipt and machine on the bench. Something needs to be better organized here, but kudos on the food Milestones!"}
{"text":"Great big private booths. Lots of plug ins.  Staff was super friendly and food was delicious.  What more could you ask for.  I will def be back.  Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent staff and very good, imaginative food.  I'm a real fan of this place and I'll give other Milestones' a shot because of them."}
{"text":"Well we had a huge family reunion today at Milestones at the South Centre; without a reservation we asked for a table for 12 and were seated fairly quickly.  

The waitress looked overwhelmed she was expecting another party of 10 beside us, but it didn't seem to affect her service.  

This Milestone is classically designed, nice chocolate brown palette with comfortable seating and dimmed lighting.  Perhaps a modern take on European art nouveau.  

Menu design was really nice too; a threefold menu with leather covers, it was easy to read and was very elegant to hold. I decided on the night's special of Sirloin Steak with shrimp and lobster topping, everyone else was in a steak mood, so there were many orders of rib eyes, and prime ribs at our table.  

We settled for two nice Australian bottles of red wine, and  I made a note that our waitress was both sweet and efficient. 

There was not ever a lull in the courses, mine however was the only one that included a very large Cesar Salad, which was really yummy, I could taste the shredded fresh garlic and it had a slight hint of anchovy.  

It wasn't long before our entrees came and were passed out rapidly at our table.  My steak although medium rare was a little tough and others commented that it wasn't the best steak that they had tasted.  

The garlic mashed potatoes however were very nice, but my special order came with only 3 shrimps and a very small piece of lobster, definitely disappointing.

Four or five desserts were then ordered and these were all priced quite reasonably at seven dollars, were served in good portions and were very tasty.  

All in all for 12 people it was $500 including the tip, not bad, but  Milestone would not be the first choice for me to eat steak in the future.

All in all however, Milestones South Centre is a nice location, very near to South Centre Mall, has a classy interior and pleasant service."}
{"text":"Its a parkinglot restraunt.  Had low expectations to begin with and they delivered on that."}
{"text":"I have been to this place around 10 times, and have never been disappointed. Their servers are professional and the service is consistent. and if you are a big group, having difficulty finding a place to accommodate you on weekends, you can always count of Milestones."}
{"text":"Stopped by the X-Iron Mills location tonite with a friend for dinner before catching a movie. Greeted and promptly seated with a promise that our waitress would be with us shortly. 15 mins of waiting and watching the 2 waitresses serve the 2 tables beside us before the manager dropped by to see if we have been served yet, we said no and he told us he would get someone right away. 8 minutes later, still no service for our table but the couple that just arrived got their drink orders taken. Had enough of the lack of service and went next door to Boston Pizza where we were seated and served in 5 mins.

A real pity for Milestones as I will NEVER go back to their again. Your servers lost out big time as I usually tip 20-50% (on outstanding service)."}
{"text":"\"Yay! I'm a fan\" for real! 

I stopped by Milestones for Sunday dinner with my friends and had a really great time enjoying the awesome drinks and the very delicious food. 

The shining new restaurant is in the \"food district\" part of the CrossIron Mills-- beside the Boston Pizza and Fionn MacCool Irish Pub. CrossIrons is a destination mall for the out-of-towners or for the people who will spend more than 5 hours in the mall, which is very possible lol, so I like that they are a few eating options.

I had the Yam Frites, Ultimate Fish Tacos, Chilli Popcorn Shrimp and I stole a spoonful (or ten) of the Roasted Mushroom Soup. Everything was really awesome. I dream about the Yam Fries, everything was seasoned well and plated like it was from a reality TV cooking show. The Popcorn Shrimp was quite literally on popcorn! Two thumbs up for creativity. The prices are like most franchises, the starters were under fifteen bucks.

As for drinks, I had the Blackberry Vanilla Bourbon Sour it was spectacular!! I really enjoyed it, I don't think I've ever had a bourbon before and now I'm a big fan. Milestones have some really cool drinks specials-- and I will definitely come back to take advantage of the Girl's Night Out Special on Mondays which is 4 bellinis and 4 appetizers for $40!"}
{"text":"Meh, though I can't think of anything I had here that was Terrible, milestones is really the epitome of a half decent chain restaurant.

The burgers are ok , the fries are ok the entrees are ok the cocktails ok too. And recently (about two months ago) I came here for the top chef items featured on the menu. I tried Dustin's strawberry shortcake dessert and guess what? it was ok and both times I came I didn't get to try Chef Connie's Fried fritter things! They were sold out both times! Go figure, the only reason I came here was to try them fried balls! Oh well!! That's life I guess!  They could have made all the difference!!

So yeah milestones is quite mediocre fare nothing particularly great and nothing bad I am on the fence with this place."}
{"text":"I visited with my parents, and we walked in to be immediately greeted by a very friendly greeter at the front door.  That's where the positivity ended.  The waiter seemed completely uninterested in dealing with us, never once asked if any of us would have liked another drink.  The food was average, except for the bread pudding my dad ordered as a dessert.  It was dry and lacking any flavour.  A disappointing visit in general."}
{"text":"I was quite happy when this place opened up at Southcentre. As much as I like to try independent restaurants, sometimes it's nice to have a chain close by when you don't want to worry about possible inconsistency. Yes there's Moxies and Earls near by, but they've been in the neighbourhood for decades and the addition of Milestone's is a welcomed refresh.

I've come here with a range of numbers, from larger groups, to just me and my mom. Every experience has been great."}
{"text":"I used to like the food and atmosphere here but now they both have gone down hill. We came here recently on a Friday night. The Restaurant was busy but understaffed.  Our waiter seemed to be scrambling around trying to get to all of his large tables, meanwhile I witnessed other staff not even offering to assist him. When we ordered our drinks it took about 30-40 minutes to arrive (and I must point out, it was beers and wine, not mixed drinks). 

Food is mediocre at best. I ordered the Cajun Shrimp. The veg was over peppered and shrimp over cooked, but it took so long to get our food I just picked at it waiting for everyone to finish their meals so we could leave. Everyone else had the same feelings on their meals - not horrible but 'wouldn't order it again'"}
{"text":"We ate here on a leisurely Sunday for an early dinner before our movie at about 6:00.  I was very impressed with the food and service.  I can see the restaurant as being busy, so we came at the best time.  The calamari appetizer was very high quality and tasted clean and fresh.  It had a crisp outer texture and the squid was butter soft, slowly melting in my mouth.  I ordered the Cajun Shrimp Creole, which tasted as close as it can get to the food I've had in New Orleans.  My husband ordered the Prime Rib and it was cooked to perfection.  Cocktails were flavorful and well balanced.  Very refreshing to the palette.  The Belgian Chocolate Ganache Torte was a decadent finish, extra plus was that it's a gluten free dessert."}
{"text":"I went back last weekend after shopping till dropping and I gotta say that the service was exceptional this time around and the apps again were excellent.  But the steaks were sub par. I could make a better steak at home.

We were a group of 4 and we all ordered drinks and again found them slightly watered down- I don't know if this is an issue in that they don't get to the tables fast enough or if they are over iced but my mojito and the companions caesars were both meh...

My husband and I both ordered the steak and in all honesty my husband who is a steak lover and does not usually complain found it quite gristly and tough.  Mine was actually burnt on one side and flipped over to hide the fact that perhaps it was forgotten and was waaaaay overdone to be medium, and there was quite a bit of cartilage in my cut as well.  I ate what I could and pawned the rest off to my dinner companions; we did not complain as we were tight on time and because our server was so sweet so we just let it go.

If I come back it will definitely be for the apps and might do so for lunch. I'm struggling between 2.5 and 3 stars as drinks were watery and the steaks were killed also, I tried jasmine the rice my companion had and found it was very bland and uninspired, needed something to liven it up.  I'll leave it at a pass with 2.5."}
{"text":"Friendly service, wide variety of a menu items, and quick service make this place and go to location for upscale business meetings. I have been here many times, have not been disappointed yet. I recommend this place for upscale business lunches and modest dinners."}
