{"text":"4th Ward food options are few; if you must dine here, stick with the salad bar (including soup - typically Au Bon Pain brand).  I stepped out of my comfort zone on my last visit and got a chicken burrito/rice/beans (Mexican counter).  What a mistake!  Almost certain that the chicken was recycled from previous days Indian counter.  Aside from the bizarre curry powder flavor in the chicken, both the chicken and beans were about as salty as I could tolerate.  The Spanish rice was dry and forgettable."}
{"text":"3 for convenience however this place is way to expensive for mediocre food. If you have another option I would take it."}
{"text":"I live across the street in Post Gateway so I considered this place a hidden gem when I discovered it. It is set up in true cafeteria style with many different stations. The menu changes each week and the items are different each day as well. The food stations normally consist of Chinese, Pizza, Deli, Salad bar, Comfort food and more. They also have pre-prepared sandwiches, soups and snacks like yogurt with granola and home made desserts.   I believe some of the employees come from Johnson and Wales, but I'm not 100% on that. The staff is very friendly and the cafe is actually pretty affordable. For instance, everyday you can create your own deli sandwich made to order, add a small bag of chips and a fountain drink for only $5! A (big) slice of pizza, small side salad and a drink is about $6. If you create your own salad and add grilled chicken plus a drink, you are looking at about $8. Either way, you will definitely get more bang for your buck here than most other places around Uptown Charlotte for lunch.   The cafe is only open during the day, which sucks for me considering I'm always across the street. They close around 2:30pm every day and are not open during the weekends. Bytes typically feeds the office workers who work in this BofA building or work nearby. I usually look out of place when I roll in wearing shorts and a t shirt. =)  Overall, this palce has good food for a small price and the selection always makes me excited when I first walk in because of the different choices offered each day. If you live or work nearby and are around during the week, I suggest that you check this place out for lunch in this area that isn't Bojangles, Chik-Fil-A, Subway, blah blah."}
{"text":"Bytes is the go to cafeteria in the Gateway area.  They serve breakfast and lunch. There is a station for everything, pasta, salad, wraps, burgers, pizza, etc.  They usually have a different theme daily.  The food is just ok, I haven't had anything that was really good, the chicken wrap, the pasta, the asian dish were all just ok.  I still plan to try other things, there must be something here above average."}
{"text":"Salad bar is not very good and it never changes. For those who work in this area and have very few choices, it's sad we can't have a good salad bar. Nothing looks or tastes very fresh. The chicken has a weird taste to it.  If you want a sandwich, the sub making station is ok. Breakfast takes a very long time but if you can wait, it is good."}
{"text":"It is a corporate cafeteria.  Decent salads and sandwiches.  A bit over priced."}
{"text":"[Location Location Location] That's what they say right?  Well, Bytes is in a perfect location with a large facility with lots of seating.   Right across the street is Johnson & Wales Culinary school so what more could you ask for?   Sadly none of these matter when you can't find good help and when you do, you ruin it with frozen foods and expect them to make it taste like a ray of sunshine.  You can have all the stars aligned but it will not help if you do not take advantage of it.   The food here is sad and just blah!  I saw Lauren H.'s review and I feel rather bad for her as she must not get out much and has no idea what quality is.  Maybe I should envy her?!? Either way, if you need a quick bite to eat and taste is not that important, stop in.  If you are in a hurry and want breakfast, forget about it as you will stand there 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 minutes and no one will acknowledge you or tell you to kiss it."}
{"text":"A great place if you workout at the YMCA next door and need a bite (no pun intended) before heading to the office after a workout.   A good selection of good for you and bad for you food along that includes processed and non processed food."}
{"text":"I work for a financial institution that has a large presence in Gateway Village. I down here several days a week and find the convenience of the cafeteria combined with the necessity of midday back to back calls too much to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was only visiting Charlotte so I can't speak to consistency, but I tasted the best soup of my life (second best if you count the Caribbean) here at Bytes - Sweet Potato Bisque.  It is their \"soup of the week\" this week so if you have a chance to get there you MUST try it.  Everything looked fresh and the salad bar was good (not great, but fine).  Very friendly and helpful service too."}
{"text":"I love this place - best place for a quick lunch for $6. The staff is great and make sure to get Brian to make your sandwich."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast and for cafeteria style dining, it's A-Ok. Was meeting some colleagues before I headed out of town. If you work in the surrounding 'village' it's a nice affordable option to have. The breakfast options were minimal, but they had the standard fare.   Eggs, sausage, bacon, gravy, danishes. You can build your own combination and be on your way or you can wait for a made to order omelette if you have time to spare. Was it the best I ever had? No. Was it an easy/nice place to gather with business partners? Definitely."}
