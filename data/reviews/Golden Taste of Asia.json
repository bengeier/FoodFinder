This is a family business here in Bradford and one which I plan to continue supporting. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Excellent food! The Dosa's are great (especially the spicy Kara Dosa). I've had almost everything on the menu and I can honestly say I've never been disappointed. Some of my favorites would be the mutton briyani, the Kara dosa, and the masala tea."}
