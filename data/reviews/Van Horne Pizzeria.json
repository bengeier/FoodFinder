{"text":"Every Monday I order a cheese pizza here and every Monday I come back. Laid back dudes that make good pizza. I think they are a cornerstone in my experience of living in Outramont and the best Pizzeria in the hood. Like Garfield I hate Mondays, and like Garfield, lasagna (in this case Van Horne Pizzeria pizza) makes it all better."}
{"text":"I love Van Horne Pizzeria; every single time I've gone there or ordered from them, it has been nothing less that an awesome experience.   The actual shop isn't anything fancy, but their pizza is fantastic. The workers there are always extremely friendly and helpful, as well as being both French and English speaking. Delivery is free, service is great. The pizza isn't the best I've had, but it is the best I've had in Montreal for the price! The only downside would be they're not open super late, so make sure to order before 10 or so."}
{"text":"I used to go here as a child and order a small poutine. I've been back a couple times since then and everything is exactly the same and just as great. The gravy is thick and flavorful, and they use mozzarella for the poutine instead of cheese curds. I though this was a huge faux pas, but it was delicious.   The all dressed pizza is one of the best pizzas I've had in Montreal. Their subs are also very good. It's a local, not pretentious restaurant that focuses on delivering good food. I do not live in the area anymore, but anytime we are in Outremont this is where we go to eat."}
{"text":"Ordered a 4 cheeses pizza but I ended up eating just the bread.  The so called cheeses were absolutely tasteless so was the pizza.  Sorry but I will never order another pizza again from Van Horne Pizzeria."}
{"text":"This pizzeria has been a hidden gem in the neighborhood for ages now. The interior is unassuming and simple, but the food is top notch!   Delicious pizza, surprising poutine. And.... Amazing steak submarine! Absolutely delicious with fried onions and other goods.   What can't this pizzeria do?!  Get the 14 inch steak sub! Great price too!"}
{"text":"Petite pizzeria de quartier, on ne peut pas avoir plus authentique!  Les pointes de pizza sont Ã©normes! (Seulement en semaine, avant 16h)  Une des meilleures poutines en villes!  Les proprios sont des grecques dont la brochettes de poulet + salade grec est aussi un bon choix!"}
