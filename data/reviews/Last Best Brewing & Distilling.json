{"text":"Alright. 

5 stars for a pub is a lot. But I'm going to give that for this spot. 

Beer is excellent. Cocktails are wonderful. Try \"The Rifleman\" for a delicious and addictive treat. 

And the food is really good. From burgers to grilled cheese... Excellent. And dude... Seriously... The wings. Especially the spicy bbq.  Of. The. Chain. 

Darren was our server and was super... Just a great experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"Went with party of 6, beers are good, service needed work but wasn't terrible. One out of 6 enjoyed the food, none of us would go back for the food. Go for beers though. I'm certain their wings coke from a frozen, pre-breaded bagged package - close to the worst hot wings I've ever had."}
{"text":"Went as a foursome to watch part of a baseball game. Think this might be the last reincarnation of this space! The former Amsterdam Rhino/ District have been melded together to create a cozy yet spacious Brew pub. 
Only had drinks this time around but the menu looks delicious and the server we had was awesome. I do like that despite having tvs all around for watching various games, it didn't take away from the atmosphere. 
This is definitely a go to for large groups who want a upper scale casual place to go."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very cool; however it is extremely difficult to get a table walking in off the street as almost all are reserved.  I ordered the fried chicken sandwich and upgraded to the poutine.  The chicken was moist and well cooked but I have to question using the same batter as the fish and chips for the breading on the chicken. It made for an odd texture that I wasn't quite prepared for.  The poutine was average and definitely not worth the upcharge given how little gravy and cheese curds were actually on top of the french fries."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, fantastic beer, steak melted in my mouth. Definitely worth a check out."}
{"text":"Last Best is a trendy and fun little spot to go for casual drinks with friends or co workers. Nice enough to go straight from work in a suit and casual enough to wear jeans. Its the happy medium of dining. The food was good, the service was great, and the atmosphere is fun and trendy. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Great beer. The show pony pale ale is quite bitter and is excellent.  The IPA, porter, and grolch are also very good. 

We ate a sandwich with fries, adding the fish of the day - Arctic char in this case.  The fish was great (nice to have this option after moving from Vancouver to Calgary).  The fries are VERY salty and come across as being frozen processed fries (MacDonalds-esque) - the most disappointing part of the meal.   

The best beer in Calgary, and the food we tried was above average, but not at the standard of standard of similar places we'd frequent in Vancouver."}
{"text":"While Last Best's neighbourhood competitors may have more beer selection, the small space and unique atmosphere is what sets this place apart. 

I enjoyed the Last Best IPA with my bison burger and my friend had the classic fish and chips. The taste and presentation of both the burger and fish and chips were perfectly on point. I especially like how the fish was cut into small rectangles instead of the usual huge fillet of fish overpowering the balance of the fries and often times reaching over the sides of the plate.

Last Best have also taken their love of coffee to the next level by offering pre-brewed, nitrogen infused coffee by the keg. The nitrogen creates a delicious, frothy layer of bubbles that adds a depth of richness that one would normally get from adding cream to their coffee. Although I'm not a huge fan of coffee and would never dare to drink a cup black, I was won over by this interesting cold, creamy, bubbly brew. Served by the pint, a Nitro Coffee is the perfect end to any meal.

With an offering of delicious food and interesting and creative ways to deliver their beer and coffee to consumers - Last Best knows how to deliver."}
{"text":"5 out 5 for atmosphere. Had the coolest experience with a juicy burger and a in-house IPA. The is hands down my new favourite spot in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Great beer. Food was not good. Cold chicken panini.  Undercooked fries. Veggie Burger had a stale bun and flavourless patti.  Service was slow to boot. Go for drinks. Don't stay for the food."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but i was hungry, only had soup at lunch. There is something about burnt cabbage that's not appealing.
I guess I should start out by saying i had the Dirty Bird, braised Brats, two sausages on a less then white mashed potato's, with shredded pickle beets. And a mustard seed drizzle around the outside. Plate definitely scream eat me. Oh and did i mention the burnt cabbage. Interesting flavours but not what i was looking for I guess.
Beer is cold and refreshing, service seems okay.

I'll be back for beer"}
{"text":"This rating comes with extreme unfortunates. I have enjoyed many meals at Last Best  Brewery. However, last night after showing up with a party of 7 and literally being spoken to by a server to be told \"Because you didn't make a reservation you guys should be lucky I'm seating you, you better be fast because you have to be out of this table before 9\", I will not be coming back and definitely will never again bring visitors to this establishment because it was absolutely embarrassing."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for happy hour on a road trip last month. I had the wings off the happy hour menu and they were spectacular!!!! Also tried the ox tail hand pies, those were really good too but not on the HH menu. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive. The beer was good and would definitely recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"So we decided to try this pub, had guests that were brewmaster at a micro brewery in London.
Service was horrible, our waitress was chatting and giggling with every guy in the bar instead of paying any attention to us , even to get the bill was challenging, at the end she tried to slip an 18% tip because in her mind we were eight, 3 couples plus one equals 7.
I requested that she take out and did not tip, my daughter spoke to the Manager, terrible experience.
My wife was specific about no chicken on the Natchos.....they were full of chicken with garlic which my wife is allergic to.
Food was ok Service lousy 
Will not go back!"}
{"text":"If I lived here this might be my second home.
And that's without having tried the food, which looked/sounded amazing.

Local breweries always warm my heart, be it in America or Canada.  The trend of craft beer is real around the world, and proof of its efficacy is here.

I sat at the bar, ordered a Last Best IPA and it may well have been.
The IPA was delicious, melon notes, mixed with a pleasant sweat bread like malt .  Just ever so bitter at the end in all the right ways.

The bat staff was really helpful and was happy to share their story, name and some samples.

They have not started distilling their own products yet, so for now only the brewing portion of their name is correct, they do have tons of spirits.

Can't wait to go back and get some food and try more beers.  This place immeaditly felt like home away from home."}
{"text":"The best brewery in the Calgary area that I have experienced at this writing.  Outstanding beer, good food, and highly knowledgeable staff make Last Best an essential stop for any beer maven.  On my next visit to Calgary, Last Best will be on my itinerary."}
{"text":"As an out-of-towner, allow me to say that having a beer habit always ends up being expensive when visiting Canada. Finding a spot with $5 tall pours on happy hour was like finding an oasis in a desert. Absolutely love the vibe here, especially coming in and smelling a fresh mash.

I ended up with a day off in Calgary on a business trip, so I kicked back four pours while watching some curling on the TV over the bar. The bartender took great care of me, always checking in as I neared the bottom of my glass. I think my favorite pour might have been the Kombeercha, the 'buch definitely cut right through the dark beers to create a lovely, refreshing sip. The Tokyo Drift IPA had great hop character and was not as sweet as big IPAs tend to be. On a cool spring day the Porter and Oatmeal Stout were lovely dark warming quaffs, smooth and complex without too much carbonation.

The beer was let down a bit by the food. I had the Vegetable Panini and everything other than the vegetables was well done. The panini itself was well grilled, with the bread crisp but not rock hard, and the fries were basically perfect - who doesn't love fries and beer? The flavor on the panini was good, with the chevre providing a smooth tangy background to the eggplant and zucchini. The only problem was the vegetables themselves had no texture at all - the eggplant was soft, the zucchini was soft, the peppers were soft... you get the idea. A little care on cooking the vegetables and it could be a great sandwich.

Lovely spot that I would definitely come back to, but I'd skip the sandwich."}
{"text":"Only ever been to Last best for beers or an appy or two. I like the décor and the feel of the place. The staff are really friendly and I think service is fast and efficient. 

When you ask a server for recommendations on beer they actually know their stuff and are helpful. Also, I love the \"Albeerta\" merchandise but, I think they changed it from the cool old school alberta logo to something else... which just isn't the same. 

Cannot really comment on the food and find the beer a bit limited so, 3 starts it stays."}
{"text":"Went to the Jasper location first and once again they did not disappoint! I had the IPA, which is more of the \"northeastern style\". Think hazy, hop forward, huge aroma and taste. Love it! Enjoyed the poutine too. Being from Montreal I can say theirs is \"legit\" ;) Friendly staff."}
{"text":"4.5 stars but I'm bumping it to a 5!

I was so happy with my experience at Last Best last Saturday. I had arranged a surprise birthday party for the hubby (without checking out the place before - I know, I'm a risk-taker), and I was stoked that everything went so smoothly.

We were a party of 12-14, and the waitress was attentive, informative and super friendly. A bunch of us ordered the beer flights and we all loved it. A nice mix of lagers, porters, wheat beers and seasonals! I was apprehensive about ordering food because of the mixed reviews on here, but my fears were turned upside down. The food was delicious! I ordered the bone marrow and it was really tasty. I tried the bison burger too, and damn that was good! Others seemed to enjoy their meals too - no complaints whatsoever!

In the end, the waitress nicely separated the bills for everyone, which was an AWESOME surprise. Every time you go out with more than 6 people you know it has the potential to be a nightmare because so many bars and restaurants refuse to separate the bill. Not here! Last Best did a great job dividing up the bill with no questions asked, and was extremely accommodating, even when we had a few people leave early and a few people arrive late. 

The space is really spacious and airy with brick walls, big artwork. Just overall great decor! The bathrooms were a french colonial style and totally unique! 

Overall, I am very impressed with this new addition to the Calgary bar scene and will definitely return. Glad I picked Last Best for the birthday surprise event!"}
{"text":"It's a brewery after all.  The ambiance is a bit more sophisticated than the average hipster-y spot. Come for the beer, there's a good variety of local craft beer and it's actually pretty good. Food is ok though. I had a burger with poutine. I regret having the poutine, the gravy is not replaced by some sauce that makes it too sweet and mismatch the burger flavours. I'll come back.... just for beers"}
{"text":"Best beer and food ever!  You gotta try this place...."}
{"text":"Coolest. Place. Ever! In-house made beers with different malts, ales, and flavours make this the coolest pub! Being both a distillery/brewery and pub/restaurant makes this place versatile and unique!

Came by after dinner on a Saturday night, and sat at the bar. Wasn't sure what beer to get, but the bartender was extremely nice and explained each beer in reference to our tastes. We ended up getting 6 different ones in a tasting option for $15. Quite a good choice if you're unsure or wanna try more than one! 

Outta the six, the 3 I liked the most were the Snow Pony Pale Ale, Barrel-Aged Red Ale, and the Caramel Latte Beer! Yummy how they made the beer taste like an actual coffee! My friend also tried the Mini Grilled Cheese and said it was brilliant, including the caramelized onions! 

A great place to spend your evening, and a lively place with the bartenders not getting a break! Not quite the place id you want to have a heart-to-heart chat though..."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Friday for some happy hour action which carry's on until 6pm which is great as you don't have to sneak away from work to get in on time. 

Managed to snag a spot on the patio as it wasn't raining and surprisingly nice out. They were pretty quiet when we arrived but pack inside by the time we left.

Happy hour is $5 for draft beer and 2-for-1 appetizers. Beer is good and lots of options there. Food is pretty tasty too, just disappointing on some portion sizes. 

Mini grilled cheese is really tasty. 3 little brioche grilled cheese sandwiches with amazing beet ketchup on the side. Honestly could eat 2 all by myself and not share, mainly because they are really good.

Pretty impressed with the chicken wings, as one of the girls was late and 45min after the wings hit the table the skin still had a crispy bite while the chicken was good and moist. Just honestly find it hard to justify $14 for wings when grilled cheese on brioche bread is only $12.

Toasted focaccia comes with cheese and garlic on top and fresh baked to order. Came with 3 sides, one of which I think was honey butter and was destroyed in seconds. Great dish to share. $11.

Lastly we tried the beef cheek poutine. Beef cheek was amazing and tender, with a great hearty gravy/sauce going on. Now lets take a moment for the fact that everything wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese curds and that its the smallest portion of poutine I have ever seen for $17! The burger costs lest than that. I get that beef cheek is more expensive, but $17 still feels extreme to me.

All in all food was really, but even at 2-4-1 deal I found it to be very expensive. Will absolutely be back for some $5 beer though, and the sweet patio.

On a massive high note, our server was amazing. Totally missed getting her name unfortunately. She was attentive to check in on us and left us alone to chat. Timed coming past the table really well and we never had dirty dishes or empty glasses just sitting in front of us. She would get the place 4 stars all on her own."}
{"text":"So I went to this place twice. First time was very good, great atmosphere and good service. Yesterday, however, was rather bad. I was sitting with a group friends and we were waiting forever for the waitress, she mixed up orders and in general had no clue what she was doing. Check your bill as ours had 2 drinks extra that we didn't have."}
{"text":"3 stars for beer, 3 stars for food but 4 stars for atmosphere so honestly I had to round down.

I got their sampler, and the bartender could hardly do math. They had 10 beers on draft and he said 2 were out. Their sampler was 6 so he said I could just pick 1 I didn't want and I could get all the rest. Clearly, 10-2-1 =/= 6. 

Anyway, their caramel latte was interesting. Their poutine was awful. Don't ever, even, ever, ever, ever. Their burger was okay and the salad could have used more flavor. Overall it was a great spot to chill, and I loved the bar and the 1920s feel of the whole place. Other than that, definitely not the best or most delicious brew pub I've been to."}
{"text":"Last Best is doing it right. Like me, you probably have sampled Last Best's offerings at events or pubs in the city. But what you were missing out on is their unbelievable rotational tap selection (called \"Here to Play\"). Innovative and delicious brews reminiscent of some of the more experimental breweries south of the border can be had from their Alberta-shaped sample tray. I must say, one of the best imperial IPA's I've ever drank. Their beers have excellent balance and lots of flavour. For a truly unique experience, try their nitro-brewed Caramel Latte. Mind blowing. 

Last Best also partners with a other brewing companies including Jasper and Banff Ave to share the distilling responsibilities on their diverse spirits and mixed drinks menu. I personally didn't order one as I couldn't tear myself from the beer selection, but offsetting reviews were positive from my table.

The food is delicious with a variety of healthy selections and ideal beer-pairings. Service is friendly and informative, and the beer prices are very reasonable and poured to correct pint sizing. Outside, they have a semi covered patio that also has a fire pit  you can sit around at night--complete with loaner blankets. 

#1 brewpub in Calgary at the moment, unseating my beloved Wild Rose. It's Last Best's innovative and fun selection of brews that put them ahead of the pack."}
{"text":"Neat place, love the atmosphere and décor. Large place with a small feel. Love how the bar is in the middle so you can watch the bartenders and all the guests. Beer was great, I recommend the Caramel Latte beer if you like coffee, just don't drink too many, there is caffeine in them!"}
{"text":"The service is always great and if you don't have the corn bread fingers you are missing out."}
{"text":"Spent a few days in Calgary and stumbled upon this restaurant. Great beer, decent food and ambience. Ordered a bunch of small plates to split and the foods really good. The bread with honey butter was incredible. Wings were great, also. All the food and beer went well together We spent a few hours there laughing and the staff was friendly and attentive. We even ate into one of their sister restaurants in Banff without realizing it until we saw the back of the menu."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the beers and service (Dagny). We weren't going to eat at first because I bumped into an old co-worker who told me she didn't like any of the food they ordered (wings, calamari, knuckle sandwich), which were the things I would have ordered. 

We ordered a flight of beers that Dagny arranged by tasting order. She was genuinely ethusisatic that made us want to stay and give LBBD a fair chance. She guided us through the menu (and  did not recommend any of the items my co-worker ordered).

Best thing I ate was the grilled roasted chicken panini. The bread was crunchy, the filling was hot, cheesy and really flavourful. Skip the fries (bland) and get the mixed green salad. My husband loved the dates and other goodies in the salad."}
{"text":"Yes, yes and yes!

Last Best takes the classy-casual style of popular Calgary beer halls and gastropubs, and brings you as close to the beer as you can possibly get: right in the brewery.

Once through the big, bold yellow doors you'll walk into an open-feeling space, proudly showcasing the brewery through large glass windows. The room is built around a large centre bar, the primary feature of the main room, surrounded by plenty of booth seating that's well lit with natural light. They make good use of the building's bare brick walls and includes plenty of aged wood and steel for a warm, raw feel.

Off from the main area are a few separate rooms, including a slightly segregated upstairs room, perfect for a sit down dining experience or an event with plenty of windows overlooking 11th Ave. As well as a completely separate basement bar.

I'm so thrilled that one of my favourite patio spots in the city is now back in action! Completely hidden from street view, Last Best has a courtyard patio with a fire pit.

Along with their signature beers that are \"here to stay\", which are available at many pubs across town, you'll find a selection of limited time, or \"here to play\" beers, only available at the brewery for a limited time. 

Signature beers include the rich and floral Show Pony Ale, Dirty Bird Black Lager: a dark beer that still pairs well with patios, the Porter: black coffee flavours like the Dirty Bird except way more badass, and my personal favourite, the IPA, which is not only boldly hoppy but somehow has this tropical fruit almost peachy taste to it. Remarkable.
 
As they are a brewery as well as a full-service restaurant, you can buy growlers of beer to take home with you. Beer to go - not a common feature of bars in Calgary.

My first ever visit to Last Best marked a quick tour and a glass of their incredibly delicious, but only \"here to play\" Imperial Stout. I can't wait to check out the food menu next time and plenty of patio days after that."}
{"text":"Randomly came here because I was craving desert and I'm so glad I did! I ordered the blueberry grunt and let me tell ya,  it was gone in less then 15 minutes"}
{"text":"Grass fed beef = way to go. Amazing beer, amazing food. Grilled cheese appie is just great.
New favourite place to come on my days off, the beer selection is small, but every beer is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Tried corn meal calamari. What a bad day it was. So ridiculously made , so awful to taste buds... Wish they could fare on others...
As I am not a great fan of beers, I got the feedback from my friends who were sharing the table for the night. They said they liked 3 out of 6 samplers. 
May not be the appropriate place for me to visit as I am not into beers but had to be there for a friend's party.
Not to forget to mention that the ambiance was so nice and perfect. Also good to observe they dimmed the lights depending on exterior light.
Waitress were patient enough with serving and separating the bills."}
{"text":"Four stars for the beer alone. I could drink Show Pony for the rest of my life. The cocktails are good too, with a fairly original rake.

The food wasn't impressive in any substantial way and the \"Fried Bits\" appetiser was legit disgusting (this from a guy who thought, \"bits of deep fried snacks? Delicious!\"). It's probably the worst single item I've head at a bar, ever.

The atmosphere is casual and not pretentious. Lots of business folk, people on dates, and yeah you MIGHT spot the odd 40 year old hipster, but it's not really the hippest spot (so you aren't going to feel out of place if you aren't raving about the latest Bon Iver track).

Nice addition to downtown. Go for the beer, stay if you're keeping it relaxed, but bounce if you're looking to hit that hunger."}
{"text":"We had wonderful service - staff was knowledgeable and friendly. The beers are excellent and paired well with our dinner. The buffalo fry bread was incredibly good. I would absolutely eat about 50 of those at any point in time. I'll probably dream about it when we get back to the states. I had the Albeerta burger and it was very well balanced in flavor and toppings - no ingredient overshadowed the beef. The bacon is super tasty. My husband had the brats and mashed potatoes which were also excellent."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Unique menu that is excellent! Their creme brûlée rocks. The service was top notch, not overly intrusive but right on top of it."}
{"text":"I ordered the tourtiere and it was little more than unseasoned coarsely ground meat covered with a piece of pastry in a dish. How disappointing for $22.00. The consistency makes me think they used recycled hamburger patties.

Come on guys, you're not making Wendy's chili here. Put some heart into it. Ditch the \"elk\" and season your damn pie instead.

Don't order the tourtiere."}
{"text":"In May of 2015, Last Best Brewing & Distilling opened their doors to Calgary. Since then there's been a lot of positive reaction and hype, so I've been very excited to check it out! And well... now I have! First off let me just say, I'm impressed! I formerly knew this space as primarily the Amsterdam Rhino (it was also formerly shared by Brew Brothers Brewing Company and District Urban Tavern), and I could not believe how much they turned the place around. The former space was dark, dingy and overall unimpressive. What it is now is simply beautiful; it incorporates shades of rustic and industrial in a modern way that truly feels Albertan, overall it's warm, inviting and offers a lot to look at! 

Arriving on a Friday afternoon after work it was extremely busy, I was impressed that they had incorporated tablets for a modern booking system that would send a text when a table was available. We had them put our names in and headed over to the bar where we decided to stay. The hostesses weren't very friendly and kind of gave off an arrogant vibe, I don't know why, but it always seems like the new hot spots in town attracts this unattractive personality where people think they're a big deal and don't have to be polite just because of where they work, but anyways... I digress. The seating inside was very charming and bright, everything is new and shiny! One thing my eyes were immediately drawn to is their courtyard patio, gorgeous outdoor spot! I definitely hope to be on it before summer ends! Instead we were seated where the action happens, at the bar. Their beer tap handles, rinsers, spill-area and overall bar top area were well kept and maintained, always happy to see good cleanliness habits!

Their drink menu features all their in-house brewed beers, don't expect any of your conventional beer choices here. I'm not a big beer snob, but I still had to go with the beer flight of course ;). Their beer names are great and all six of the choices I had were good and had something different to offer. The IBU ratings were a nice touch as it gave me good ground on where I should start and finish. I actually preferred the Show Pony Pale Ale and Caramel Latte Beer the most as I tend to enjoy lighter tastes for warm weather, the latter was especially delicious and had a great froth! They even did a wine flight which was great for my fiancée who has gluten restrictions, I haven't seen these kinds of sampler trays for wine elsewhere, very welcome surprise. I would love to see a gluten-free beer on tap eventually though. 

I was also impressed by the food menu that has a local/Albertan flare to it, they even share their story/name that explains the \"Last Best\" being based off \"The Last Best West\" campaign that drew immigrants to western Canada, very cool! The food selection was moderate, prices a tad high but the choices they do have are quite unique and true to Alberta. I had the Knuckle Sandwich with fries and my fiancée had the Grilled Romaine Salad. There was some items that mentioned specifically being gluten-free as well, more reason for that gluten-free option on tap lol! The sandwich was just okay for me, it was well balanced but it felt like it was missing something or was just too light on something that would bring it all together. Good fries. The Grilled Romaine Salad was awesome (I finished off my fiancée's leftovers, hehe)! Who knew some grill and char to romaine lettuce could make such a different?! Great flavours that worked awesome together, I really enjoyed the ale mustard dressing as well.

The bartender was average, didn't add much to the experience and wasn't very personable. Managers didn't really engage any tables/customers. The best employee I saw was actually a porter who was working non-stop and always smiling! To sum: Great new restaurant/pub for Calgary, quite happy with this one! Has all the right ingredients to be a huge success, just hope the staff gets a bit better. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really love some of the craft beers that are popping up in Alberta lately. These folks took it a step further and opened a pub along with it.

The inside is far bigger than I thought it would be. Very welcoming layout and decor. If I didn't have to drive and work the next day, I probably would have stuck around for a year or so relaxing.

Our server was Jennifer. All smiles and great service. Not wanting to limit my beer palate, I went for the sampler. 6 little beers to tickle my fancy. Of course, I wasn't a fan of all of them, but it was a nice variety to get acquainted to the brewery's beer ensemble.

The food was lacklustre. Not awful, just not as good as one would hope considering the quality of their brews. I don't think it was worth the price, but maybe it was just a misfire on this occasion.  They deserve a second chance. Even if the food isn't better next time, they still have the tasty, delicious beeeeeeeeeer *Homer drooling sound*

The Show Pony is the favourite of the 6 I tried. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"We came here for a work event on a Friday afternoon which meant there was a big group of us coming in, they put us in a nice little side room that was separate from the rest of it which worked really well to allow the group to visit with one another and all sit together.

The decor is great and lends itself to a great overall feel. It's a large place with lots of seating available. The drinks were good and they had a wide selection of appetizers depending on what you're in the mood for. I know a few people who have also done the brewery tour and they said it was great."}
{"text":"Their brewmaster needs a raise! Last best has the best IPA out there and they keep trying to beat it which makes for a great ongoing experience. Food is pretty good too."}
{"text":"I can only give this place a 5 star not because of their great selection of beer but for their professional service and customer service attitude. From the time we entered this place till we left, we were treated like VIP customers; our server, Louise, was so professional, kind, attentive and welcoming that made it an enjoyable night for us.
The food was also great; we tried couple of different Salad dishes, their fish and chips and their Lemon Zest and Pepper chicken wings; all I can say is that all of these were tasty, fresh and designed really good; I normally don't see a good food in Bars/ distilleries but this place is an exception. Everything we tried was just perfect.
We also tried few different samples of their beers and I really liked most of them.
Thanks Louise one more time for making it a great night for us and thank you Last Best team for your great work overall in making your customers satisfied.
I definitely recommend this place; they have a Patio also which is also heated."}
{"text":"Where do I even start? 

This is an exceptionally beautiful place to be. There is nothing that isn't on point here. First, they make their beer RIGHT HERE! Talk to your server or call ahead and book a tour of the brewery!

Seating is spread out and a wide variety, at that. A large room with tables of various heights, booths, and a large rectangular bar in the middle of the place that has seating on both sides. There is a bright front room and, the jewel, an amazing patio featuring a fire pit and recessed seating as well as tables 

For all you parents, you'll be thrilled to know that not only do they welcome our kids, there is a nice little kids menu for them to choose from. Under 18 is welcome until 10pm I do believe. 

Now, on to what we all really care about, the food! I've tried about half the menu now and nothing has come up short. The striploin made my cattle rancher dining companion groan with pleasure. This same man bemoaned not getting good beef in yyc restaurants not 5 minutes before his food arrived. The root beer BBQ wings are crispy on the outside and tender inside and oh so flavorful.

The desserts are amazing, especially that carrot cake. I am having a blast eating my way through this place!"}
{"text":"love their beer, but honestly I like to drink it at the Ship more than at the brew house... not sure what that means? Maybe I'm more of a casual person, and the brew house/lounge/whatever? It's a bit too loud and trendy, so obviously I'm becoming and old lady and you should ignore me. We had dinner and drinks, the beers are great if you like microbrews, but the same pint of show pony is a buck cheaper at the ship so there you have it, i'm old and crusty and cheap too...

anyrate, food was great, but on the pricer side. Fish and chips was like $20, it was good and a large portion but still... the same fish and chips can be had at other pubs for a few bucks less. other menu items ranged up from there, only the burger was cheaper so keep that in mind if you imagine a night out with food and beers. Don't get me wrong, the dining scene in calgary is going more upscale, and $30+ bucks for a bison steak is not entirely unreasonable, but when I think of a brewery I am in the mood for bear and something cheap and salty to eat with it... that's my two cents. I'l be next door at Broken City..."}
{"text":"Last Best Brewery is located where the old Amsterdam Rhino used to be, and much like when it was the Rhino, the atmosphere and ambiance of the establishment is a blend of what I feel is kind of homey with an industrial modern decor. We went there for a birthday party and the service was good and pleasant for how many people there were. Drinks and food were fairly average and on par with most of the other \"hip\" trending eateries nowadays but I did feel some of their food was overpriced. I ordered the mini grilled cheese, which had 3 in the order, and consisted of cheese and caramelized onions and was $12. I would probably go back the Last Best Brewery but I may just stick to drinks next time."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Interior was cool and classic. Very friendly and knowledgable service staff. Nice patio area. Beer list is all in house brewed beers with a great variety and a few guest taps. Caramel Latte beer was a personal favorite. As was the cast iron nachos. Definitely my new home away from home when visiting Calgary."}
{"text":"Visiting Calgary and had to find a camera store to replace by camera's battery. We noticed Last Best Brewery was only a block away, so we thought we'd give it a try. It was still early (4:30pm), so we were surprised when we went inside to find the place almost full already. It is a contemporary bar/restaurant, wide open space with high ceilings, so the acoustics were challenging.  We were able to get one of the last high tops in the bar and promptly ordered a beer sampler of 6 of Last Best's own brews. After enjoying those, the dear hubby and I ordered the 8 oz sirloin, medium, to split since we werent overly hungry. The steak arrived quickly and was a thick, beautiful piece of meat, cooked to a perfect medium. It was melt in your mouth tender and absolutely DELICIOUS! It really was the best sirloin I've bad in a long time!!! The meal came with duck fat potato wedges, braised greens, and crispy pigs ears, which I'd never had before! Oh so good! We walked out of the restaurant saying how we wished we had a Last Best in the U.S. because we sure would love to try some of their other dishes. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Stopped by Last Best for dinner with some friends, along with some drinks. It was a quiet Tuesday night, which we liked cause we can actually hear our conversations! Haha.

I had the beef burger with white cheddar, as well as a show pony pale ale. The pale ale was IMO an acquired taste due to the citrus...you have to really like the bitter/sour taste in order to enjoy that drink. The beef burger was quite good, although not the best I've had. Decent for what it's worth.

Service was great and the server actually conversed with us quite a bit since it was a quiet night. It was nice to talk to a Calgary native about restaurants, food, craft beer, etc."}
{"text":"Oh dear. Last Best, you have such a good reputation, and pretty fun beer, but god have my food experiences here been unequivocally subpar! 

I have now had food a few times here now, most notable of which was my most recent visit. I opted for the Albeerta Burger (double patty) cause I figured, it's a pub, burgers are pub food, what could go wrong!? 

It wasn't cheap, but the shoestring fries that it came with made me feel like I was at a burger baron. kind of mushy, soggy. the burger itself was really boring, with no flavour and a lack of effort on the whole. I would not come to Last Best for food anymore - maybe a beer but that's it!"}
{"text":"In Canada and Calgary for business and saw this restaurant on Yelp.  A business partner and I decided to try it for a brew and dinner on a Monday night.  

We decided to sit at the bar because the bar chairs looked so comfy....and they were very comfortable. We arrived a little after 5 and was told that it was happy hour.  The 16 oz draft beers were only $5.00. I had their IPA and was floored by how good it was.  It was also served in a very clean glass and the beer was nice and cold. 

The menu was very interesting with a good selection of a wide variety of different kinds of food.  The menu seems to lean to a fresh farm to table type of selections and the entrees and dessert we ordered were incredible. 

By the way the male bartender that served was one of the best waiters I've had serve me in a long time.  He was always one step of us, anticipating our needs before we asked and very knowledgable about the menu."}
{"text":"Albacore sandwich was meh, lacking flavor. The roasted chicken panini on the other hand was warm delicious goodness. Nice beer selection on tap, and it was nice that even after 6pm on a Friday night they had a brewer available to give us a tour."}
{"text":"I only came here for drinks. Well they have pretty good happy hour deals. If you are looking for cheap beer, they have $2 beer if you come here before 6pm. I had a mojito. Not bad not bad. They brew they own beer and you could get a growler here if you like. 

I have to come back for food. When the server walked by with the food, it smelled good. Heard from colleague they have good beer and good food here. Guaranteed consistency."}
{"text":"Love the beer, love this spot.

There's nothing like being up close and personal with the beers that you are drinking. With plenty of beer options to choose from, I opted for the flight to get a sample of the best that Last Best had to offer.

My all time favourite is still their Last Best IPA. There's something special about the IPA that just stands out above the rest.  A comparison would be Brewsters, but I still think Last Best takes the cake here.

Also, side tip. Went in again last night to fill up my growler. Came out to $14 and it was fabulous."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere, I loved the decor. Also a great poutine and I loved the drink I had (mr. pimms Wild ride). I don't usually like gin but it was nicely hidden in this drink. The service was slightly slow but that is my only complaint."}
{"text":"Met friends for some drinks and apps. Great atmosphere and a very nice patio. The beer selection was great although I drank wine and bubbly. We ordered nachos to split between four ppl and it was the perfect amount.  Service was great and they were very attentive. It's a big place with lots of different seating options. Def will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I like this place! Atmosphere and decorations are awesome. The bartender is super friendly and they have fantastic beer. I had \"bread and spread\" from the menu and it was delicious! The bread was warm right out of the oven. 
The only thing I didn't like is that I like to buy glasses from local bars to have them and home and drink beer, but their price per glass is $12 which I found a bit expensive"}
{"text":"This place is soo good, I've been here twice! Their pub fare is pretty decent, you just have to be open to trying some interesting things. We tried their chicken wings; which are so flippin' great, and their oxtail hand pies \"empanadas\" with curry. Pretty tasty, and succulent. In Canada, they usually don't do pints, so they serve 18oz, which is only two ounces, but apparently size matters in Canada. I love it, the glasses are big, the menu is short and simple. We sit at the bar and the service is easy breezy. The beer selection is short, but they have a lot of rotators and seasonals. I liked their hefe and pilz; some of the best brew in Alberta. Canadians are really friendly, they gave us a free tour of their brewery and offered us some tix for the beer fest in Calgary... for gratis baby. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Another great brewery and pub addition to Calgary's downtown. We came here for a late lunch on a sunday and the place was quiet. The space is huge with a very large enclosed patio, two different sets of bathrooms and a big round bar right in the middle. The prohibition style and décor was gorgeous and relaxing. It wouldn't be the best place to watch a sports game with just a few TV's situated above the bar though. We sat in a booth and the table legs were very awkward and in the way which made getting in and out unpleasant though. Our server was very polite and we never had to wait long for food or drink. She recommended good beers to try and was knowledgeable about the selection.

Our favorites were the WIPA, scotch ale, and Imperial IPA. The caramel ale was a pleasant surprise as I don't like coffee and it smelled very strong but was pleasantly smooth and didn't taste at all like coffee. For food we got a Panini and the Penne. Both were delicious with generous portions. Overall we can't wait to come back and try this place out again, hopefully on a busier night to get the full experience."}
{"text":"In recent years there has been an explosion of brewpubs and breweries in Calgary...no less than 15 at last count from small brew bars located in industrial areas to big brewpubs like Last Best. And as big beer lovers I can tell you we have tried almost all of them. But we always keep coming back to Last Best, which -- hands down -- has the best beer in Calgary. And most brewpubs either do the beer well, food well but rarely both. Last Bast is the odd gem where they do everything well. The staff are always super pleasant and service is great. The restaurant venue itself is an amazing space, and even nicer in summer with the big outdoor patio. There is also an associated downstairs bar and barber shop!  My favorite beers are the Show Pony and Last Best IPA but you cant go wrong with anything here.  We recently tried their brunch menu and were not disappointed. Try the huevos rancheros!"}
{"text":"My partner and I are always looking for great eats at great prices. Today we had the opportunity to hit Last Best after church for brunch. First time eating there and it did not disappoint. Typical brunch fare well prepared and considering the price of 12 bucks per person, it can't be beat. The bacon is to die for and I love bacon. 

Staff are super friendly and the place is super casual making you feel right at home. Nice place to relax on a Sunday. No doubt we will return."}
{"text":"I'm at a 3.5 on this one. It's a bit of a love - hate going on.

The staff/servers are 5 star. They are great
The ambiance is 4-5 star as well. It's very modern feeling with a touch of steam punk from the brewery.

The beers are excellent as well.

I can't quite wrap my head around the menu and the portions.

Bison Burger..  was OK.. but the bun was weird. Tasted like gluten free buns do. Dry and sandy.

Baked beans are great! Portion is pretty small considering.. .it's beans.

The wings are breaded...  I hate that. I would go to KFC if I want panko.

The salads are exceptional, especially if you add the fish.

It's not a standard pub menu, which is their strength and their weakness. If you're tired of garlic ribs and fries, give this place a try. As the place is relatively new, there's a good chance they will continue to experiment and refine their selections and that's great.

I will return.. and recommend... but that's more for the ambiance, the service and the beer."}
{"text":"This place defines the word \"gastropub.\" It's a wonderful spot the get really great very and delicious high end bar food. 

I have been to Last Best a couple of times now in different nights of the week and different times so I finally fell comfortable reviewing it. First off, I love their beer. I think it's well made with excellent flavor and finish. I'm not always a fan of the show pony, which seems to be the summer beer, but I think it's a solid choice for those like the lighter options. Anyway, you can get their beer on many places around town, do why come to the source?

Well, first because you can come to source! That seems to be an obvious one but I thought I'd throw it out there. Second, you get to try more than just their seasonal beer and if you're like myself and their darker stuff, this is going to be the only place to get it until winter kicks in (and who wants to wait for that??). Also, the atmosphere is great. They have an expansive dining room, gorgeous bar, and even an patio area to enjoy. There is so much space that it's not hard to find a spot, but if you go on a Thursday or Friday night there might only be a few chairs left at the bar.

As I mentioned, this place defines gastropub in every way, especially the food. It's all well made and must of it is beer inspired in some way. There are beer battered fish and chips and beer stew and the such. They also have a good selection of other items but I am a fan of hanging out at the bar and getting snacks so I haven't tried as much of their food as their beer. 

I would say that the cocktails are not are strong as their beer and food but I wasn't really judging it that way. I think there are other places in town that do great cocktails so if you want great beer come here. 

I also love the service. The bartenders are all friendly and helpful and even on a busy night I was checked on numerous times. This really is a great place to start your evening with a great meal or maybe finish it with a nice dark beer and a great conversation."}
{"text":"Happiest ever. My sister and wife had the Halibut and chips, my brother in law and I went for the bison burger. Clean pub food, great service and a fantastic atmosphere - what more could you want?!"}
{"text":"This place is marvelous. House beers are great, food is phenomenal, and a great atmosphere. Super friendly staff who even put the Flyers game up on the TVs in the bar for us."}
{"text":"The patio was packed but inside was fairly empty. We shared a picnic table with another couple. 

I wanted to order a sampler, and I tried but they ran out of 4 of the beers, so basically there wasn't anything to try. I ended up with an IPA but couldn't enjoy it because the server forgot my order while my friends went to the bar and order a cocktail. We tried to flag her down but she was fairly busy with an attitude and ignored us for awhile. The people next to us were frustrated as well. 

We did order poutine and it was a waste of money. It was so small and tasteless. Supposedly a popular item. We finished that and my friends finished their drinks and my beer finally came out, when we were able to flag down the waitress. I didn't get to enjoy it and chug it down since we were heading out.

Note to self- next time order at bar or sit on the other servers side."}
{"text":"Great, family friendly establishment. Have been there a couple of times and both times the food has been great. The Albeerta burger is one of the best my husband and I have ever had. As I write this, my mouth is watering! The information says that they aren't kid friendly but that is incorrect. They were very accommodating for my kids and they have a nice looking kids menu. It's nice to find these places when you have kids because it's not fun being stuck at chain restaurants with crap food and beer. Oh and the Olsch Kolsch B'Golsch is delicious!"}
{"text":"Popped in for a flight while visiting from Toronto and was treated to some outstanding summer beers - the tropical notes on the pale ale and Berliner Weisse were out of control, and just the story behind the Saison Brisebois was worth the price of admission!

Had a solid walkthrough of the beer menu and a great chat with one of the staff about the Calgary beer scene.

Didn't get into the food but from what I saw and smelled, I may have to come back during this trip to sample!

Strong 4 stars based on the service and beer, getting in to the food menu would likely bring that up ;)"}
{"text":"Chill place for food and drink, new menu as of last week according to the bartenders.  The fried chicken sandwich was pretty good (side salad was delicious), but it was surpassed by the Albeerta burger (added cheese, do it).  Perfect size, flavorful and juicy - in my top 5 of Calgary burgers, look forward to going back for round two.

Drinks are good and right priced, I'd stay away from the \"beer cocktails\" and keep it simple with just beer or booze.  Christopher, one of the bartenders, was super friendly and a pleasure to chat and steer me straight on floating bow river beer Sundays."}
{"text":"New restaurants and brew pubs in Calgary, take note.  When you open a new place, you need to be well staffed.  

We went to Last Best for a light lunch, mostly to sample their seasonal beers, which you can for $15. 

They had lots of staff available and our server was very nice and patient.   She needed to brush up on her beer knowledge though, rather odd hiring someone who hasn't sampled all the beers she serves yet.

All of their \"Here to Play\" beers were amazing.  A few standout favourites were the Olsch Kolsch B'Golsch, King Ralph's Imperial IPA, and my favourite, the Caramel Latte beer infused with Fratello coffee.  This beer is s nitro beer, with a creamy head, and lower carbonation.   Many breweries are starting to play with this new nitro beer sensation, and I love it.

Their food menu states everything is Alberta inspired and they do have some nice menu options such as marrow.  I had the mixed greens and they were tasty, I loved the candied figs and seeds that accompanied it.   

Can't wait go go back and have more of their menu and return for more of their unique and tasty beer.  This place is one of the first breweries in Calgary to offer so much variety and flavor in their beers."}
{"text":"Food was cold and nothing special. Not worth the overpriced menu. Beer was good. Not in any rush to go back. Bar has cool vibe and intimate patio."}
