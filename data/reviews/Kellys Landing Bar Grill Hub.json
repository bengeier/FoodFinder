{"text":"1st time @ Kelly's and I'll definitely be back. On a Friday evening I started my day off with an $13 dollar 32oz Heineken!  

Our bartender was GERMAINE!! She was amazing in every way.  It made our experience enjoyable! Germaine walked us through the menu and lead us in the right direction. I ended up going with the Moroccan Curry! It was amazing. Other choices of our group that were all 5 Star were the mussels  and 8oz steak fritas- both cooked to perfection. 

We will be back and for sure be visiting Germaine at the bar!"}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed the Naan Chicken Club with sweet potato fries and the sticky caramel dessert... Heather took care of us and was excellent... loved my experience at Kelly's Landing in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came in on Saturday night after attending the Wine and Food expo. Me and my friend wanted to grab a quick bite and have another drink. It was around 11pm. We were seated......and then we waited. It must have been over 15 minutes until our server finally showed up. The only reason we didn't leave is because it was pouring with rain outside. Our server seemed either stoned or just really ditsy. She had to come back and re-take our order twice, and both times she was wrong with what we ordered. After the food came, she became a bit better and stopped by asking if we needed extra bread for our shared dip. Overall, I would think twice about ever coming back here again."}
{"text":"Germaine took care of me while I ate here. Amazing service, great energy and good menu choices. I will definitely return and have recommended it to my friends."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 13 or so friends today and immediately did not get the friendliest welcome from the hostesses because we didn't make a reservation. Mind you- it was 3:30pm and the majority of the tables were still empty. They said it would be hard to find us a table, even though there were plenty of long tables meant for large groups that were available. We were seated within 5 mins despite their concern. 

Once we were seated, one of the hostesses asked us how we would like our bills because they \"prefer to use one bill per table\". When we responded separate, she asked how many separate bills we wanted, and we told her separate bills for everyone here (we are all students by the way). She responded that it was not a problem, but judging by her tone, it was definitely a \"problem\" for them.  

Our waiter was friendly, but unfortunately was not the most efficient. He had a difficult time taking our orders, remembering drink orders, failing to respond to us when we tried to get his attention multiple times, bringing the wrong items out, etc. He also brought everyone's bills out when two people clearly stated that they were the only ones that were leaving early and wanted their bills, while the rest of us were staying to order more food and drinks. 

However, food was pretty decent- I had the Landing Burger and fries and it was a satisfying burger, but was disappointed by the amount of fries. Drinks were priced as you would expect for a restaurant down town, but they were not outrageous (ex. $9.50 for a glass of sangria)."}
{"text":"Went in to Kelly's and sat at the bar, we had a great bartender named Germaine and she gave us great suggestions for wine and vegetarian options.
Location was easy to reach from ACC and we found the location bright and new!"}
{"text":"The food and service was absolutely amazing!!!! Our waiter Vishal was top notch he went above and beyond to serve us!!"}
{"text":"We went there for the company lunch and I ordered the tenderloin medium rare.  It was terrible for the price.."}
{"text":"My experience at Kelly's Landing was just OK. The atmosphere was nice and staff was friendly but the food took a while and when it got to our table my bolognese was just warm, not hot, which was disappointing. 
When I went to make a reservation on opentable, nothing was available until 6:30 (I was looking for a 5:45 reservation). We decided to drop by anyways and to our surprise, much of the restaurant was empty! 
I also disliked that our server took it upon herself to top up our pint classes from our pitcher because I didn't want as much beer as she gave me. 
I think that given the area there are a few better options for dinner but all in all it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and the food is good though on the expensive side as its a bit fancier than your usual bar food. Decent beer selection on tap and cool atmosphere. However the service is seriously lacking here. You'll get seated quick enough as there seems to be more hostesses at the stand than servers. On both occasions it took forever for anyone to come over and the second time it wasn't even that busy. So given the fact that there are a ton of other places to go in the area we just walked out after sitting at a table for 15 mins without so much as anyone bringing us a water. Went across the street and got served right away which was a nice change. So my advice is take a pass on this latest Landing location. Definitely not a good place to hit up before a game or concert as you'll for sure be late. They need a serious overhaul to their service before I'd think about coming back here!"}
{"text":"I came by here for dinner one night. I had a lobster dish, which was just ok. The drinks were delicious! I definitely enjoy a well-crafted cocktail and this place did not disappoint. The decor is modern, but inviting. It is definitely fun for a night out or a dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for a Friday work lunch and it was pretty busy. Buffer for a 1 1/2 lunch. Service is good, but not considered fast for downtown Toronto. 

Must order: sausage picante pizza. 
Thin crust, great toppings and flavours. Prob one of my fav pizzas in town 

Can skip: the wings. For $14.50, I think we only got 7 wings. And it was either way too spicy (spicy jerk) or way too salty (ancho pepper lime). 

It's been well reno-ed since the last place. Cute fireplace under the sunlights and lots of TVs."}
{"text":"From out of town,  Kelly's Landing was recommended due to its location. Loved the atmosphere and the employees. Our waitress, Abigail, was very helpful. Gave us many helpful tips and suggestions for my time in Toronto."}
{"text":"I wonder if people that go here look out the window at the Jack Astor's across the street and wish they went there instead - I did. This place is basic. So basic."}
{"text":"Had their turkey sandwich and it was to die for. Great atmosphere as well and let's not forget the excellent service from  Jermaine."}
{"text":"Awesome place to hit up before a blue jays game! Patio atmosphere even if you can't get a place on the actual patio. Patio was full so they sat us at a table in a retractable roof section (just like the Rogers centre!!!) feature beer of the day was creemore, 30oz for $12! Couldn't ask for a better deal. Staff was really friendly and definitely into the sports events in the area! Would 100% come back!"}
{"text":"Server never checked how was the foods. No water refilled. And she served the the special Caesar's landing drink that supposed to have lobster tail. But there was none. And not letting us know in advance. Discount doesn't solves this issue. Cause you knew it before you served the drink. That's ripped off and the service was super horrible. Once was enough."}
{"text":"I went here for a soft opening food blogger event (as a guest, I'm not a blogger). I also went back for lunch and drinks two weeks later. The food here is consistently good, as it is at the other Landing locations. Service was good and decor/ambiance is nice (but a bit generic). This is a solid three star review. I have no complaints. The reason for the three star review is because the place has a bit of chain restaurant feel, which is not my particular style. While the food is consistently good, it's not great or overly memorable. 

This is a great option for before Jay's games, when meeting people visiting the city, and for tourists."}
{"text":"Daniel K. was the most attentive, kind and personable while serving my friend and I at dinner on a busy Saturday night. Thank you Daniel for your amazing service.  We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant located right by Union Station! I came here with my coworkers on a Wednesday night and we had a good time. The atmosphere was very lively for a Wednesday night and they even have an in-house DJ! I ordered the 100km roast half chicken (maple chicken with market vegetables) and it was delicious. My coworkers ordered the steak frites, mussels, caesar salad, and other items and there were no complaints! I will definitely be coming back to Kellys Landing!"}
{"text":"They really need to work on the level of service in these places. Extremely understaffed during busy hours and slow."}
{"text":"After a long flight, I came in on a hot afternoon to meet a buddy for a quick beer, maybe some food.

Was greeted by the hostess and I asked, for their sake, if I could put my carry-on baggage somewhere, to which she responded \"not really\". Fine, but she could have put a bit more effort in given it wasn't a lot, and being directly across from Union Station, and being such a huge place they could have found somewhere. She then suggested I could keep it with me, again fine, but pointed to a little dark corner for me to sit in. I declined the offer and sat at the bar.

The main bartender saw me, but she was busy so I was greeted by a manager type. Gave me a water and said he would be right back to take my order. He did not. The bartender finally came around, and decided to first serve the two suits who have came in well after she had noticed me sit down. She eventually asked, \"are you doing okay here?\" and, given I had nothing in front me, I asked for a beer.

This place clearly only does well because of its location and proximity to the sports venues.

I didn't stay long enough to try the food, so no comment there.

Based on the first impression, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat and drink before an event at the Air Canada Centre. 

Our party of 6 had exemplary service, on a Friday night no less. Kelly's Landing is huge! I think it used to be a Kelsey's? Lots of seating and TVs for all your sports-watching-needs. The food is above average for a downtown upscale sports bar. I really enjoyed my margherita pizza. Plus, $13 for a 30oz pint of Heineken (that butuys drinks special) is key. I wish we had more time before the Raptors game because you better believe you won't find drink-specials at the ACC. 

What I loved most is our server made a point to get us out of the restaurant in time for the basketball game AND he took the most creative video of our table without me having to ask - what a gem."}
{"text":"Been here twice for dinner. It's a beautifully designed space with lots of seating in the dining room as well as the bar area. Lots of TV showing sports as well.

An interesting selection of beer. It's really from everywhere; they serve the usual suspects, craft beer as well as imported beer. A good spread! 

Food is on point, as it should be for a chain. Steak Frites are fabulous! Steak is tender and cooked to order with a pile of fries. You will not leave hungry. On my second visit, I tried the Righteous Greens. It's a tasty vegetarian dish with a kick. This is a one way trip to flavour town. Last but not least...the Chocolate Cake. Did I want to try a different dessert on my second visit? Yes. Did I? No. That giant slice of chocolate heaven was calling me. Coated in a fudge-like icing with some cherry in the middle, this cake was a sweet ending to each of my visits.

Service is great. The servers all seem to have an outgoing and fun personality. The hostesses were grumpy. On my second visit, seems I was the only one with a reservation waiting in the crowd of people. Was 15min early, she said my table wasn't ready. No big. 7pm rolled around, so I went and asked. Felt like she forgot about us! I made the reservations for the bar, but they seated us in the dining room. Boo. 

Still a cool spot. Will probably be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with my Mom on Wednesday before she caught her train. We needed something quick and filling. I explained that the Landing was part of a chain but seeing as this part of the world is a land of chains, it seemed like the best option.

I started with the $12 stein drink special, which seems like a real winner with the Bay Street Crowd.

Lunch for me was the fish Tacos, while Mom had the seared Tuna Salad. The Tacos were quite large though it has this fancy coleslaw on top which I didn't quite fancy. The Seared Tuna was also a large portion and decent tasting 

Service was quite fast and efficient. Everything came out quickly so there was no danger of my mom missing her train 

A solid 3.5"}
{"text":"I decided to eat here with a friend a few hours before my flight out from Billy Bishop airport -as the restaurant is located right across the the shuttle pickup point,in front of the Fairmont. A large venue - equipped with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. There is even a retractable sun roof on one side! 

The good menu was simple and the drink menu elaborate. However the downfall was that the food took forever to come out-over 1hr!! I ordered a turkey burger with a side of sweet potato fries -20$. It wasn't anything special. My friend ordered a medium well done steak frites that the kitchen kept on screwing up, both times the steak was cooked medium rare. The staff did not offer us a complimentary drink or something to compensate for the mishap or the delay in time to serve our meals -when I mentioned I needed to catch my flight in 30 mins. My friend did noticed more fries on her plate! Cheap replacement. 

We did get complimentary cookies once we got the bill. This place is good for casual drinks for watching a game - I wouldn't come here for food."}
{"text":"Right across the street from Union station. Perfect place to grab lunch or have a drink while waiting for your train connection. We had three hours before going to Windsor, and it was about lunch time on a Sunday afternoon. This place has a very nice open bar sitting and some regular height tables. Very friendly waitstaff and good food. There are a lot of large television to watch football or soccer. Good place to meet friends in between trains. Would go back again!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here, though I don't know how relatable it will be to anyone visiting here most other times.

I came for their Superbowl party last week. Though they could've done more in terms of atmosphere for the party, they totally nailed it in terms of the food. For $25, they had a pig roast buffet. It was as advertised since they brought out an entire roast pig (head included) and then carved by the buffet area.

The pig was cooked heavily in Jack Daniels honey liqueur?. Of all meats, pork lends itself best to sweet and it certainly paired perfectly here. The skin was almost like candy and the pork belly literally shot out the marinade when bitten into.

The buffet included cornbread, potato salad (dijon mustard-based - my favorite way), coleslaw (vinegar based - again my preference), along with homemade kettle chips and a few dips.

A concise? buffet, but each item was done very well and cohesive together. Terrific value at $25.

A few at my table ordered from the menu. It looked pretty good, though I can't really speak to it. At the very least, they still deserve high marks based on my visit. It's not likely you'll come and a pig roast will be available, but I had a good enough impression of the place that I would at least give my blessing to anyone interested in checking the place out."}
{"text":"A happening spot and a go-to place when staying nearby.  Good beer selection, decent burgers.  I also tried the steak frites which was also tasty.  Not a very big menu but plenty of options."}
{"text":"I was in here for the Superbowl this year.  The whole hog pig deal with sides was pretty good and service was really decent, but depending where you are in the room, the sightlines and the sound for watching a sporting event on the tvs was meh.   It was especially true for the sound, basically couldn't hear anything as it was a bit echo-ey and bass to high.

Also, it really wasn't much of a SuperBowl atmosphere.  I've been throwing SB parties at various venues for a decade, and this basically seemed like any other night.

They also wouldn't put on the American channels for the non-football fans to watch the commercials, which basically is a deal breaker.

SO, this review is really for the SB night, it was ok.  But I'll have to move on to another venue next year for all the reasons stated.

I will come back for a regular night to see how it is though."}
{"text":"Kelly's Landing is located at the south west intersection of Front and University attached to the Citigroup building at 123 Front W.

Fellow Yelper Tony F had made reservations for a group of us to enjoy the game at Kelly's Landing for Superbowl Sunday.  The footprint inside I have to say is absolutely huge and deceivingly large considering how many places in the city don't have as much seating as this place.  While this place is not exactly a sports bar they did well to be able to host the game considering there's a nice bar area as well as alternative seating which for the most part was empty for game day.  The area surrounding the bar seems to be the most lively considering all the TVs are concentrated in that immediate area.

For Superbowl Sunday they had a special outside of the normal menu which they were offering as a special.  It was 25 dollars for what was an all you can eat pork picnic.  They essentially roasted a big 175 pound pig which was disassembled at the station.  Skin and ribs were in one container, pulled pork in another and other cuts were being carved at the station.  Sides included corn bread, slaw, beans and considering the game was going to be several hours including the halftime show, 25 bucks is a great deal since you could always go back for more.

For starters they had some sort of nacho or fries special as well.  Basically they were \"Fries Supreme\" (a la Taco Bell) as well as \"Nachos Supreme\".  The appetizers were about 13 bucks each and weren't that great in size and since we shared we basically just had a bit of a sample of each.  

The place had a variety of beer to choose from but I went with the 30 oz Dos Equis which was also on special for the day.  

This place may not have been the most ideal of venues for sports but it was better than decent.  The food option was well worth the price of admission and the service was good as well.  While I had a look at the regular menu the special just made the most sense considering the amount of time we'd be there.

Otherwise this place just seems like the type of place to have business lunches or a quick drink.  While it's right beside Union station I suppose it could be a consideration for pre-game meals considering how close it is to the sports venues in the area (ACC and Rogers Centre)."}
{"text":"This place was right across the street from our hotel which was perfect for our slightly hungover selves to get to for brunch Sunday morning. 
The decor is great, kind of modern style with the Edison bulb and dark wood. It was beautiful inside. 
We were seated pretty quickly and the server was attentive and quick with our orders and such. 

Most of us got the Lobster Benny and one got the brisket Mac and Cheese. She had asked the server if it was enough for one person and the server said yes. But when it arrived it was like a very small cut out from a baked pan, and not like a regular bowl of Mac and cheese. So that was weird. The Lobster Benny was perfect however. 

So we finish up and the waitress messed up the ordered for the bill. Also one of the girls tells us that last time she was there she found a live lady bug in her car and the owner gave her his card and told her to tell the server \"he'll take care of her\". So she tells the waitress and the manager comes back and say they'll comp our mimosas. So we get new bills still messed up so we get new bills messed up in a different way. It was all very confusing!!

But we got it figured out finally. It was just kind of an okay experience. I would probably return if I lived in that area but not as a visitor."}
{"text":"We were part of team that were being appreciated by another team for our work on an initiative at work. Thus we landed on a weeknight at Kelly's. 

We got a counter height table and chair for about 30 of us. The weather that day was amazing and we were located right where the restaurant ended and the patio started. The team of servers assigned were really good and were very attentive. The restaurant was packed as the offices were being emptied. The location of this restaurant is amazing - right opposite Union Station, short walk from Rogers Centre or ACC ( or is it BNS Centre?). 

The food that was ordered was just appetizers and finger foods, not dinner. The items ordered were non vegetarian and some vegetarian. The only vegan items on the table were Fries and Sweet Potato Fries. The food looked amaze and most of them finished almost everything by the end of the event. 

Service amazing, good food, location you couldn't do better. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on a Saturday at 12:30pm. We made a reservation beforehand, so we were seated right away. This place is quite large with many seats though, so lineups probably aren't too bad. There is a gender-neutral washroom as well.

I ordered the landing breakfast, which comes with 1 slice of buttered multigrain toast, jam on the side, breakfast potatoes, 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, and 2 slices of peameal bacon. Both the food and service were decent."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a few quick nibbles this afternoon. We were very impressed!  Nachos and scallops were excellent. Service was great. All of the servers were so friendly. We were sorry that we didn't have time to stay for dinner. We will definitely be back to eat our way through the menu!"}
{"text":"This place looked amazing when we walked in everything is modern and sleek looking. We were excited to eat at Kelly's because usually it's too busy, but today there were many empty tables and it wasn't busy, we went in very optimistic about the experience we were going to have. Unfortunately our waitress Emmeline (Made sure to get her name off of the receipts) ruined the whole experience for both me and my group of friends. The hostess sat us and was very nice, Emmeline came and took our drink order well before we ordered any appetizers or meals and after she took our food order that was it we didnt hear from her again, our friends appetizers had came and been eaten before the 3 of us even got our drinks and it wasn't our waitress that brought them, none of our plates from the appetizers were cleared and we found ourselves stacking plates to make space when our actual meal came (again given by a completely different server) and Emmeline didn't even check on us once. We finished our entire meal and the appetizer plates were never cleared from our table. When I did have to find a bathroom I ended up leaving the table and finding Emmeline to ask her where the restrooms were, when I asked she said \"oh I'll show you I don't have anything going on\" meanwhile our table had not been checked on once with the assumption that she was busy. CLEARLY NOT. I returned from the washroom to find that she still had not checked on or table who was waiting for the bill, we waited for a bit longer before a member of our group flagged her down and asked her for the bill ourselves. We left the restaurant not pleased with the service we had at all, but the food was delicious."}
{"text":"We've had a great time . Excellent service. Jackson was amazing and very friendly .. highly recommended ."}
{"text":"Just got back from a lunch with my director - thought I'd have itus immediately but surprisingly I'm doing pretty well! The place itself is huge and the location - damn they scored on that one, a step away from union station. Very modern and fancy inside, you'll never see \"non-financial district\" human beings here.

For lunch we had the turkey burger with sweet potato fries + the open faced avocado toast with regular fries. The food was sooo good! It was a pleasant surprise to see that the burger was mostly turkey and not too much bun and unnecessary toppings. The avocado toast looked hearty af. They don't give you too many fries, which I liked because me and sweet potato fries are a dangerous combo.

There are very interesting things on the menu - naan chicken club? cheesecake stuffed french toast? huuuuh?? What a rollercoaster of emotions. Would love to try the more unhealthy things on my next macro free day.

Service is great too- thanks Santana for your hospitality, especially during a busy lunch hour."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of \"fine\".

It has nice atmosphere and friendly staff, but the food is a bit hit and miss.

We ordered sliders off the kids menu for our daughter and they were TERRIBLE. Like the worst hamburger and bun combo shes ever had. Ugh.

However our food was goos. The Peruvian Chicken Salad was really different and tasty. The sea scallops were well done. The oysters were tasty if on the small side. 

A bit pricey but great location so what do you expect?

You could do a lot worse."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday evening prior to the Raptors Game.
Kelly's Landing is much like all the other LANDINGs in the GTA. 
This being a relatively new location it's a lot nicer and the venue is huge and can get crowded especially after work and/or before a concert or sporting event. 
The venue is clean, contemporary and welcoming.  Big booths and televisions everywhere to keep its patrons engaged in a social environment. 
Their drink options are pretty good and they've got daily food and drink specials.  However I decided to order a glass of wine, overall drink prices are somewhat reasonable since it's close to the financial district.
As for food I decided to try their Kellys Landing burger, which was okay.  Served with fries on the side it was an overall enjoyable meal.  Best burger? I'd say I've had better."}
{"text":"If I could give it a zero and still make a comment I would. Note to staff. If you're going to be an upscale hooters remember to speak to the women too. Duh. 
I asked what the soup of the day is and the waitress looked directly at my male friend and answered. F U."}
{"text":"This restaurant is conveniently located by Union Station so it's very TTC accessible. 

That's pretty much the only positive thing I can say.  Well also the fact that it is a large restaurant so it is great for large parties.

I was here for Superbowl watching pleasures.  Ordered the Margherita pizza.  I'm not exactly sure what i got..or if it was pizza, but I think I can safely say it was one of the worst meals I have ever had.

It was oily...pools and pools of oil just sitting on top.  I don't even recall any basil, no mozzarella that I could discern and then it had drizzles of balsamic vinegar on it.

I ate 2 slices b/c i was hungry but I couldn't force myself to eat anymore

It was so disappointing to say the least.  This might be a great place for after work drinks, but I wouldn't even want to come back here again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since their opening and have always left impressed. The food, on the two occasions I ate, was shockingly good and the service has always been pleasant and prompt. 

Now to explain my \"shockingly good\" comment:
Their tasty food is an extreme compliment to this location as I've never thought much of the flavours or dishes at the other Landing stores. In fact, the general consensus between friends is to not expect much when ordering food at these restaurants. So kudos to the chef and kitchen team here!

On my most recent visit, my friends and I sat along the bar. We were served by Germaine - she was a ton of fun! She was knowledgeable, had a bubbly personality and was never M.I.A.. I ordered the curried mussels AND BOY WERE THEY DELICIOUS! Germaine was a sweetheart and kept sending me more bread to dip in the sauce, ha, thank you!!

I speak highly of you guys to friends and will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Nothing too special - don't waste your time/money here unless you have no where else to go.

At a very convenient location, Kelly's Landing offers a vast restaurant with a pub style inspired menu. Nothing too special, your typical salads, burgers and calamari. It looks to be like a place for a larger corporate gathering with the space it has.

Seared Tuna Salad (19) - Decent, nothing memorable or exciting though. It was quite plain, but not bad either. In my opinion, there was just too much mixed greens which seemed as if it was a cheaper dish.

Righteous Greens (19) - A good hearty and warm mix of veggies. Again, nothing that popped out, but this one was slightly better better than the tuna salad.

Crispy Calamari (13) - More chewy than crispy. And the portions are quite small, for the saltier calamari bits. Definitely had better calamari else where for less.

Beware of the drink glasses!! They were very muddled, definitely not clean when we got our drinks in them. You can clearly see that they have not been cleaned well (or at all!!) - unfortunately a picture was not taken, but take caution. 

The decor is actually really nice!! Its dimly lit with a slightly romantic feel - one upside to this experience.

With many other offerings around the area, I would save my money and time for elsewhere."}
{"text":"I stopped by Kelly's Landing for a quick bite before going to a concert at the ACC. The patio looked very welcoming and busy, so we chose Kelly's Landing over the Jack Astor's across the street. 
The manager was standing out by the door and was very kind in greeting us. We were seated very quickly and our server was quick to take our drink order. The Tuesday drink special was a 30 oz. beer so we ordered a round of those. The bar was really busy, so it took a little while for them. I had the large landing salad and my friends shared the dip trio. Both were very good. The carb to dip ratio on the trio was not very good, as we had a lot of chips leftover and ran out of dip quickly. I would also recommend that they salt their tortilla chips- they were a little flavourless. Outside of a small mistake splitting the bill, everything was great!  The payment terminals ask if you would recommend the restaurant which was cute."}
{"text":"My family and I went to downtown to explore, since our flight was delayed since the night before and we had a few hours to spare. We passed by Kelly's Landing Bar Grill and it looked like a great place to stop by and grab a bite to eat. The restaurant is industrial inspired and locally sourced foods, I felt at home. The menu has several different options to choose from from meat lovers to veggie lovers with the option of gluten free. The food was delicious and so was the Sangria Blanco. I definitely recommend the Tuna Poki and the Naan Chicken Club. Delicious! They do have to work on their cheesecake crust a bit since it was over baked. The best thing about this restaurant was our waitress SANTANA. She was a delight from the beginning to end. Always making sure she was around if we needed anything or to make sure everything was to par. I have worked in hospitality for over a decade and I know what great service is and should be. I don't come to Toronto often but I would back for the service. If anyone is interested in coming to enjoy Kelly Landings Bar Grill ask for SANTANA, you will have a memorable experience. First class to her and the managers who hired her."}
{"text":"Food is actually really good here. I really enjoy their pizza. Great place after work to hang out in the patio watching people run by as I have a schooner in my hand"}
{"text":"Great for food and drinks with friends. 

Turn up early for nights that baseball games are on to get a seat!

They have a large drink menu and the food was delicious. The meals have just the right amount of food so if you're starving for a large meal be sure to order a starter.

The seating and atmosphere is fun and fancy. Easy to chat among friends. We got a high table to start then noved to a booth when more people arrived. They were very accommodating for us."}
{"text":"Kelly's Landing looked lively from the outside so we decided to make our way inside. I am not sure if it Thursday nights are usually busy, or if it was the Leafs game that had the bar packed. We were bar hopping and made our last stop for the night. My date and I decided to share a dessert and a 30oz Stein. We got the Mascarpone Cheesecake and it was pretty damn amazing, and that was the upside. The downside was that the waitress decided to split the stein for us and bring us two 14oz sleeves. Not sure if she could add because she shorted us 2oz of beer. She then tried to correct her mistake by asking us if we wanted her to bring the stein mug and pour them in. I'm not sure why she suggested that, because it was just awkward. She's just lucky that the I enjoyed the atmosphere and the cheesecake. I'll return for those reasons. JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"We made reservations on the day of for an impromptu dinner gathering and we were seated promptly the moment we walked in. The bar area is crowded and full on a Thursday night, so the seating was a little tight but manageable.

For dinner, I shared the Landing Carbonara, Seared Tuna Salad, and the Sticky Toffee Pudding. The carbonara was creamy and well balanced in flavor with plenty of cheesy goodness. It was the perfect dish for a cold winter day. The salad made a great counter balance to the heavier pasta since it was clean and crisp. The toffee pudding however, was a little disappointing. It tasted more like regular bread pudding since there wasn't nearly enough toffee or caramel flavors.

Extra star for central location convenient location and great service!"}

Came here for a friend's birthday and we had a blast. The service overall was just incredible, and really made our experience perfect. Rebecca is hilarious and also super helpful in terms of helping us with the menu. I have never had such amazing service at a restaurant!! 

Now getting into the food: 

I really wanted to try the tuna poke but $16 for a relatively small appetizer seems a little steep compared to everything else on the menu. I opted for the seared tuna salad instead and it was GOOD but I got tired of it by the last few bites. My friends both got the carbonara and that was AMAZING. It's on the heavier side so get that if you're hungry. 

For dessert we got the cheesecake and toffee pudding. Both were pretty good but not outstanding. 

I love the landing chains but this is probably my favourite location by far because of the atmosphere and service. The restaurant was packed and loud for a Thursday night but that wasn't a problem. The music is on point here and the cookie at the end of the meal was a nice touch. 

Probably wouldn't order dessert next time but will definitely return for the apps/mains and great service."}
{"text":"Location! Location! Location! In the heart of the city, near union station, Kelly's landing is always bustling with energy. 
I absolutely love the ambience with copper pipes and edison bulbs. Unfortunately after our first hour of hanging out at this spot the DJ decided to play major 90s throwback music (vengaboys!) I wish the music was in sync with the ambience, it just felt weird. 
The food was average, artisanal platter (meh!), calamari (good), nachos (good- but the guac was a weird dark green paste), sausage pizza (tasty).
The drinks were good too.
Overall good spot to hangout for a few hours but don't expect a party!"}
{"text":"Located right at Front and York, Kelly's Landing is an optimal spot for post work drinks, pre game day drinks and everything in between.

I came in a week within opening for drinks with a bunch of co-workers. The restaurant itself is great with lots of open space, an awesome patio, and good seating. We managed to get a couch section on the patio with our group. 

Service was iffy with some confusion upfront on who was server, a missed drink one but overall was acceptable given it's a new operation and a busy night. 

We had a couple appetizers which all met but didn't particularly exceed expectations. They have a healthy and wide alcohol selection ranging from plenty of wines to beers and hard liquor / cocktails - which we were able to get some custom stuff made

I will be giving this 4/5 for now for the awesome atmosphere, prime location with reasonable pricing and acceptable food, service and drinks - overall it's a good spot. However I will need to return to try a full meal given some \"less pleasant\" experiences at another Landing group restaurant."}
{"text":"I would give it no stars if possible. they have the worst staff i have ever seen in my life. went in and sat at bar and waited for about 10 mins along with about 5 other people as the bartneders cleaned glasses. one of these places that only do business cause of its location."}
{"text":"The tremendous, friendly service we received can be solely attributed to our server, the self-described \"Canadian Brad Pitt\" who was an upbeat gem.  Unfortunately the food did not match the service. My gin cocktail was average tasting and the artichoke pizza I ordered was bland with milky runny cheese,  terribly under-cooked and dripping in oil. It was sloppy to eat.  2 stars overall: 5 for service, 0 for food."}
{"text":"Always walk pass by the place but never went inside until today. We went in for some afternoon drinks, where our waitress told us that majority of seats were reserved for 5pm. Good thing we came early! Our waitress gave us a sticky toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream on top in celebration of her birthday. The splash of smoky cinnamon kick gave a great after taste! The service was friend and quick, dessert on the house always seal the deal, will come back later time for a full meal!"}
{"text":"I just wish restaurants and pubs would have more Canadian options and less oh-so-trendy-we-are-so-cool-global-and-hip options from everywhere else in the world. I have nothing whatsoever against multiculturalism, a global attitude or being open-minded, but I think restaurants are overdoing the whole Quinoa from Mexico mixed with Korean inspired Bavarian-Swedish meatballs thing.
I mean kimuchi poutine? Give me a break.

I did not go with the Peruvian Chicken Salad and Naan Chicken Burger, but their Landing Salad was wonderful. The drinks were fantastic too and both main and liquids were delivered quickly. Moreover, their drinks' menu is quite varied.

The service is kind and polite. The waitresses are well put together and the girl serving us was warm and had a nice personality. Good job.

Right after work this place is packed and it is a crapshoot if one can find a patio seat, but wait a little and things improve. The space is certainly large and happening. 

We really enjoyed it except for the crappy standard-issue screens overhanging the bar and the restaurant's ends with the crappy jock millionaires scratching their balls during game #746 of the season.."}
{"text":"I had supper this evening with my friends, Deb, Franca, Liz and Rona, at Kellys Landing Bar Grill Hub at York Street/Front Street ... they just opened about a month ago.

I ordered the 100km Roast Half Chicken (maple cider chicken, market vegetables, roasted herb potatoes and pan gravy).  It was good.  The potatoes were tasty.  The chicken was boneless and tender.  The pan gravy was a nice touch.  Everyone else enjoyed their meals.

Mark was our server.  He was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Overall a good experience.

Came here twice for lunch while attending an expo at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. On both occasions we were seated by the fireplace since the restaurant was not very busy. The ambience was great and the interior/decor looks great. Our server was prompt, attentive, and gave us as much time as we needed to decide what we wanted for drinks and food. I had the tuna salad the first time and the Moroccan chicken the second time. The presentation and the taste was good for both dishes.

They serve 30 oz Steins of beer which is good value for your dollar. I bet the patio here (in the summer) is a great place for people-watching. Great location as it's close to the ACC and other event venues."}
{"text":"Much, MUCH better than Taylor's Landing. 
Open, bright and airy (its predecessor, Casey's, was dark, dreary, out of date and sad). It's a large place and it is LOUD during the busy lunch period. 
Our server, Clinton, was cheerful and explained the menu with great enthusiasm. Off to a good start. 

My group and I spied the plates of others and I decided on the fish tacos. They did not disappoint. I especially liked the very flavourful sauce on the side. I wasn't keen on the pineapple included (and I'm a fan of the fruit) but they made it work.

Service was fantastic and they got our food to us quickly. Portion sizes were fair and employees were friendly - from the manager to the front desk greeters to the servers. 

Kudos to them. Hope they can keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Staff was super friendly, food was awesome!

Our favorite was the brisket Mac and cheese followed by the tuna poke, mussels and wings. Sticky toffee pudding was unreal! Strongly recommended"}
{"text":"What a typical financial district sports bar! Came here for drinks and food on a Friday evening, and there were times when I thought \"Wow, this place is really great\" and other times when I thought \"Seriously?!! You can do better\". 

ATMOSPHERE: If you come on an evening, it gets pretty loud and difficult to hear everyone's conversation. At around 9pm when the noise dies down, they turn up the music making you still unable to hear your table's conversation well. 

DRINKS AND FOOD: We all ordered different drinks, but the only item that caught our attention was the vodka they served. We ordered several double shots of Stolichnaya but they brought a single shot of a different brand of vodka each time (we know this because a member of our group is a vodka connoisseur). For food, I ordered the turkey burger with fries and the burger was quite tasty! The server was very accommodating to my requests (add an extra tomato, mayo on the sides) which I was happy about; however, the fries were very dry. 

Overall, I view this place as a typical sports pub and likely won't be running to this place every time I'm looking for a place to drink or eat."}
{"text":"Great bar! Perfect if you're downtown for work or a game. Best part is the staff. We sat at the bar and were served by Germaine who was absolutely fantastic. Definitely would go again!"}
{"text":"Good mostly for travellers with a few hours to spare before departure from Union station. Service has improved since it's opening and the decor is nice. Food prices are fair and there is an adequate assortment of apps, salads, and mains.

I got the seared tuna salad - at $19, it was a decent portion and the tuna was fresh.

I wouldn't come here on a regular basis (personally, I think Cactus or Earls are better) but glad this spot is there. It will definitely be handy in select times given the convenient location and comparatively less crowds."}
{"text":"First time here and I enjoyed the atmosphere. The menu has a variety of food including the sustainable salmon which I support and was happy to see on the menu. Served by the server Asya who was very friendly and polite and offered a ballot for a chance to win an all paid for trip. I will definitely come back here especially since it's right by the ACC so we'll be celebrating some raptors wins here!"}
{"text":"Kelly's Landing's been opened for 2 weeks now and I've only had a chance to come try this place tonight. It's very convenient right by the GO trains and Union station.  Most importantly it's by the ACC so it can get pretty packed on the game and concert nights.  I walk by it everyday since they were doing construction to when it opened.  There's a huge wrap around patio which is great. The decor is very modern and cool. All the doors are open so if you don't end up getting a patio seat you can still feel the cool breeze coming in from the outside.  Only downside is that there were a lot of mosquitoes and fruit flies flying around while you eat.
Food - my friend had the lobster fettuccine it's was $36 so you expect there to be a lot of lobster. There was a good portion of lobster but she said this dish was bland. Could use some flavour to it. My boyfriend and other friend both had the hamburgers and both said the hamburgers were dry and the buns were stale and not that great.  However the fries that came with it was good. It's hand cut fries.  The nachos we had to start was a bit greasy and the chips were stale. I had the Thai coconut mussels it was amazing! But the mussels were tiny.  The sauce was really good though.  For dessert we shared the sticky toffee pudding. Omg it's super sweet.  I felt like my tooth was aching from all that sugar.  It's didn't taste that good.  Too sweet.
The white sangria was amazing!! Loved it.  My boyfriend had the Creemore special for $12! Huge beer, great value. Service was excellent, our server Chris was amazing and super nice.

All in all the convenient location, excellent service and the decor of the restaurant made me give them a 3 star.  Food was below average, I've had better. I would only come back for drinks and apps maybe not for a meal. The food needs to improve."}
{"text":"There's nothing bad to say about this place. It's beautiful inside and the food is better than you'd expect it to be. Their brunch options are limited, but they do an amazing twist on the classic breakfasts- the potatoes are amazing and cooked with some extra cherry tomatoes, bacon is super crispy, and the berry jam that comes with their toast is delicious. Their coffee is surprisingly amazingly smooth.

Came back for lunch with a coworker and ordered a pasta- have to say it was not greatest. Might have been my mistake to order a pasta at a bar though. 

However, service has been impeccable every time I've been here."}
{"text":"Kellys Landing, a new restaurant from The Landing Restaurant Group, has opened up at 123 Front Street, right near Union Station.  It certainly is a welcoming spot in the area and a refreshing escape from the abundance of chain restaurants in the vicinity. 

I attended a sneak peak media event at Kellys Landing last week and I can assure you that this is your best bet for a lively atmosphere, brilliant food and top-notch drinks near the ACC/Union Station. Long gone are the days where you had to suffer with bad food from Jack Astor's or the lackluster Casey's Bar & Grill. Now you can get your pre or post game on in a spacious and modern setting full of made from scratch food items!

The restaurant features an impressive 43' x 30' retractable roof so that even if you don't snag a spot on the patio you can still enjoy the weather while sitting inside.  Besides having such a beautifully designed space, Kellys Landing has a well equipped menu.  They feature 30+ wines, 24 beers on tap, crafted cocktails and a variety delicious food options. I do think that they need to beef up their craft beer selection, but that's just me being picky. Kellys also makes a hefty Caesar that is said to be the 'The Landing Cure' for your hangover.

The food menu at Kellys is sectioned off into share plates, pizza, salads, burgers & sandwiches, mains and desserts. There is a mixture of classic Landing dishes and some newly crafted creations which I really like to see in a menu.  They also have some great vegetarian options such as the Beluga Lentil Bolognese and the Righteous Greens Bowl. I tried a few of the dishes and really enjoyed the Brisket Mac & Cheese, Tune Poke Bowl, Artichoke & Cheese Pizza and the Landing Burger.

Kellys Landing is also reintroducing their Beyond the Beer program, an initiative where 50 cents of every Dos Equis beer sold will go towards helping a local community organization. Kellys Landing has partnered with the Toronto General and Western Hospital Foundation. Proceeds raised will benefit research, education and the enhancement of patient care at Toronto General and Western Hospitals, as well as the Michener Institute of Education at UHN."}
{"text":"Their appetizer portions are quite large and can be a full meal. I had the Thai Curry Mussels which comes with garlic bread. It was pretty good! Their cocktails were not as impressive though - everything seemed a bit watered down. But overall ambiance, service, and decor are good and I would come back to try the entrees."}
{"text":"Pretty standard restaurant/bar but food and drinks are decent. Nachos are huge.. can def be shared between four people. Mussels were good.. in this yummy red curry sauce but thought that it came kind of lukewarm. Mojito was decent as well - pretty big sized drink and was light and refreshing."}
{"text":"I tried the beluga lentil pasta and I'd say it was only mediocre. I'm just continuing to finish it because it's in front of me and I paid for it. Would not get it again. My friend got the Moraccan chicken and it's also super mediocre and over priced like goodness. Can go to an Indian place and it's probably ten times better. What a mistake to come here... at least the ambience is cool and fun. Waiter was friendly. Altogether would not return , boo."}
{"text":"A nice, fancy, a bit pricey downtown dining place.
portion: pretty big, end up box half of lunch
taste: pretty good
service: 3/5, average service

We went here for group lunch. The place is fancy and nicely decorated. It is the typical downtown-financial-district type of restaurant: people there are dressed up a bit, and it is a bit pricey.
A dish costs about 20-30.
I ordered MAPLE CIDER ROAST CHICKEN, which is pretty good. It is half a chicken, big portion. It is juicy and tender, with a sweet bbq favor.
So of us ordered a salad with steak, which I header is also pretty good.
I think the service is average, one of us ordered the steak with an extra plate of mushroom on the side, but the waiter forgot about the mushroom.
It is a good fancy lunch place for business occasion, but I would not come here by myself for something casual."}
