{"text":"3.5 came here a couple of time tried the sesame Ramen, miso Ramen and the curry.  I like the black sesame Ramen most, noodle have a good bite, soup was good, however the egg was fully cooked.  Curry was good also, however they only have chicken curry, I wish they have pork also."}
{"text":"Decided to come and give this place a try even tho the reviews were very low  The place is small has bar seats of 10ppl and then 4 other tables on the side..bar stools and bar seats..I didn't fall off..so overall its OK  The decor is OK..haha u can sense they are trying hard to look modern Japanese..  Pros..nothing  Con First off there was NO AC!!! It was humid hot and sticky inside...environment overall..thumbs down   We order the following  We were provided with cold tea...but it had no taste of tea...  Shio deluxe ramen The broth was tasteless..pretty water down..worst then canned chicken broth ..the noodle felt like it was store bought...again..bland..the meat was bland..the egg was just a regular white egg ...overall..it wasn't a good ramen compared to the other competitions  Takoyaki...tasted like the ones u get at jap ayce  Crab cakes..did not taste like crab cakes at all...it had a weird white liquid inside...and no crab meat....not good  Takowasa...came with lettuce at the bottom...I guess the reason was cause the takowasa let alone was a bit too sour...wasn't traditional takowasa..    $27.07 was the total of our bill for 2 ppl...not worth it for sure...and will never be going back  Good luck to those who will be trying !"}
{"text":"I find the name of this place kind of funny, but we decided to give it a try since it has ramen. The place is small and has red bar stool with shaky tables. They have 5 different flavoured soup with ramen at fairly good price compared to other ramen joints.   I got the Miso Ramen and the portion was alright, with nice semi-cooked egg. Their cha-su  I did not really like that much. The best that I prefer is at Ajisan Ramen!!! The broth here is alright as well. After eating this, I was still left hungry. My bro had the garlic broth ramen one which is alright, but no egg. Probably would not eat here again."}
{"text":"It was fine. The ramen is pretty good, but the soup (Goma, black sesame) tasted more like salt than sesame.  It was average."}
{"text":"I hate the chairs at this place. It's fairly stupid if you ask me. The bar stools are flimsy and imo very dangerous. The chairs are fairly light and can be moved around with ease. But the problem is getting onto the chairs, I literally had to climb onto my chair and clamp onto the table then wiggle my butt around. And I was still unable to find a comfortable position where my knees wouldn't hit the damn wall or have ramen all over my jeans. I gave up and sat at the lower chairs near the front of the restaurant. Which is rather embarrassing because 3 different couples that came after us all had the same problem and one even gave out a little squirm because she almost fell off the chair.   Onto the food, Ramen was alright. I think they have 4 different broths to offer for ramen. Which is fine for me because I always order Miso. Broth was yummy, ramen had a decent bite, chashu was yummy. It was melt in your mouth goodness. I like how they added sesame seeds to the broth, it was a good touch. But I'm disappointed with the egg. It wasn't semi-cooked and its fairly salty. I wonder if its the same eggs used in chiu chou food. Portion wise, it looked big because the bowl was rather large and there's a lot of broth. So it's good for those that loves to drink the broth.   Given this place has a similar price point as the one in J-Town I think I would go back to that one instead."}
{"text":"So I've been here a couple of times and I'm ready to offer up a review that I think properly reflects this business.  As Ramen continues to grow in popularity and follows in the food trends like sushi, naturally more and more pop up.  I remember back in the day that Ramen was usually a few specialty shops here and there and it never really took up and you had the 3 stores that began the Ramen craze (those in my opinion being Kinton, Kenzo and Ajisan).  So truth be told, this one of the 1st places that I've gone to a Ramen in which I had heard nothing about the place (I literally drove into a plaza and noticed this place).  Does it hold up?  Yes...to a certain extent.  Let me list out the good points.  So the service is pretty good...I went on a Sunday for lunch (both times) and while there's one server, she's quick on her feet and she's moving around getting stuff.  Not only that, when she gave us the bill and I asked certain items to be separated, I instructed her with drawing symbols on the receipts and made separate as I asked.  I REALLY like it when servers can actually acommodate like that, so yay to that.  It's a rather small place so it gives the server the ability to acommodate but if it does get busy, the kitchen guy (owner?) will dive in and help serve.    Menu wise, it's basic of what I would expect from a Ramen place.  5 broths, selections of which meat (there isn't a whole lot of selection), with a bunch of snack foods and appetizers.  To me, the menu is a simplified version of Kinton, with maybe a few more appetizers in it, but I don't really treat this as a \"Ramen and Izakaya\" place but just a Ramen place.  The food that I ordered (Shi-o Ramen) was VERY good.  The broth was pretty clear and has a nice light flavour to it.  It's perhaps slightly salty but I can kind of get over it.  Noodles are al dente, with a slight bite to them and the pork is nice (though it could be softer).  I also ordered the Chicken Karaage which was well fried and very tasty ($4) which I thought was pretty reasonable.  It comes with a nice spicy mayonnaise and pepper salt (which I didn't bother, because it was already too tasty).    Some of the not-so-good aspects, I feel out of the 5 choices I have for broths, to me Shio (Sea Salt) only does it for me.  Sho-yu (Soya) is OK but it can get a bit salty over time.  Black Sesame which my dad ordered isn't my favourite, I thought the sesame flavouring was a bit overbearing and the colour of the broth just isn't for me.  The only other thing I wasn't too crazy about and unfortunately the restaurant can't do too much about it are the chairs and tables.  The chairs, simply put are not designed for you to sit for a long time (and I'm not sure that was intentional).  Man Ramen is the perhaps the same size as Kinton so I figured that if it does fill up that they have to find a way to get people in and out.  The chairs offer no back support and they're so high up, I feel that there's a chance I could very much fall off of them.  Also their tables are granite or some sort of stone which makes me a bit fearful of how gentle I put the dishes down...they make a clanking sound if I don't put them down gently and I personally don't want to pay up for a broken dish lol.  But, to round things up here, the place is VERY clean (even the bathrooms) and it's pretty inviting all around.  Also, they offer customer cards, for every $10 you spend, you get a stamp and with 10 stamps you get a free dish.  Only catch, gotta collect those 10 stamps within a 3 month period (starting the day they issue that card to you).  This place is pretty good and I think it's worth your time if you're around the Scarborough area."}
{"text":"Customer service is excellent! Greeted by very friendly happy workers. A nice cozy place with nice music. They recently updated their menu to have a lot of appetizers for reasonable price. You can even do 3 appetizers combo for $7. I highly recommend the mackerel....pan seared perfection for $4.   Would come again."}
{"text":"Ramen...   Man Ramen & Izakaya is a brand new ramen joint that opens in Scarborough.   It is a Chinese own and run Japanese restaurant so don't expect it to be comparable as those in downtown.   There are a few choices of broth based includes shoyo, garlic, miso and sesame based with identical toppings of bbq pork, and veggie and egg.   Goma Ramen ($7.95) - the broth is one dimension: saltiness and nothing more, black sesame is not doing much - Noodle was cooked with good bite, not soggy at all which I prefer  - BBQ pork though quite tender and plentiful, the egg though was disappointing: soy marinated mini small egg  Deco is simple and functional. The open kitchen is located at the back.   There are also Amber Brewery beers on tap, even their IPA!   There are definitely room for improvement but a good start!"}
