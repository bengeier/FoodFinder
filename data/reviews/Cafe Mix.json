{"text":"Had lunch with my wife at Cafe Mix last week and was very surprised. This restaurant is in a Mesa strip mall and is very unassuming. However, once you step inside, you realize that you've found a gem.  Great atmosphere, excellent service and incredible food are what you'll find. Plus, the prices were great. While it's a 40 mile drive from my home, I definitely plan on making multiple return trips!"}
{"text":"I love Greek food, but this place is at the bottom of my list. I don't know what people are talking about when they say the food is good. I had a Gyro pita and the pita was a little dry, which is a HUGE no-no with pitas for me. It cracked a little on the back.   Also they use a lot of vegetables and not much meat.   The people there are really rude. I have been there twice and the first time they were very rude, the second time they were worse.   My daughter spilled her drink, and the waitress was obviously annoyed, and I got the feeling she was a family member of the owner. I tried to get some napkins to clean off my lap where the drink had spilled and she appeared out of nowhere and told me not to get any napkins out, assuming I was using them to clean the table, and actually shoved the partly removed napkins back into the dispenser. She seems concerned about wasting 3 cents worth of napkins.   Then my son was trying to help clean up and took the rag she brought and started to wipe the table. She said shortly, \"give that to me,\"  and took it away.   Looking around the room, I noticed there was not any other children, so maybe the local customers have already figured out that this is not a kid friendly place.   The food? Not great. The service? Bad.   I will take a pass next time."}
{"text":"It's my second time eating here and I loved it again. I tried the #30 for two. You get a salad, a plate (with hummus, steak, chicken, and gyro meat, and rice) and baklava for dessert. It was delish! This is the place to try. It will be your new favorite."}
{"text":"I've been here once, so this review is based off of first impressions.  The restaurant is fresh and clean, has nice decor, and the staff are friendly and courteous.  This is a sit-down restaurant so if you're not doing take out, expect to pay a tip.  My daughter and I loved their fries; they are crispy and seasoned well.  I had the chicken kabob pita and was very happy with it.  The pita was soft and they didn't skimp on the tzatziki sauce.  The prices range from $ - $$, depending on what you order.  I think you get the best deal ordering a combo.  I plan to eat here again."}
{"text":"Okay, so at my husband's insistence, I tried Cafe Mix again. And again. And I'm converted. I even tried the Chicken Shawarma Gyro again -- the flavor was amazing and the texture was fine this time around. (Note to the white meat-only folk: be sure to order the Chicken Kabob, instead. Also delish.)   My husband is obsessed with the Italian Chicken Salad. If you can get past the \"why would one order an Italian Chicken Salad at a cafe specializing in 'Greek & American food'?\" question, you'll be glad you did. The sun-dried tomatoes are key."}
{"text":"Great healthy food and great people who run the place.  Regular customer and never disappointed.   Salads even great without dressing.   You should try it!"}
{"text":"This is a great inexpensive place for salads and wraps.  I love their hummus!  The service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Always loved this place but it is even better now.  Love the latest version of  tzatziki sauce. The house salad dressing is also wonderful."}
{"text":"I tried Cafe Mix with my hubbs for the 1st time last week and had high expectations based on all the rave reviews by my besties. Our waiter (can't remember his name) greeted us promptly and let us choose our table. We had said it was our 1st time and he went over the menu with us answering all our questions. He was very knowledgeable on greek food. I settled on the Greek salad with chicken kabobs and my husband got the mixs combo platter. Overall it was good but didn't blow me away. My husband said his beef kabobs were over done and the gyro was greasy. I will give 4 stars mostly because of the great service we had:)"}
{"text":"The food at Cafe Mix is truly amazing.  This is Greek comfort food delivered by your newly adopted Mediterranean family.  I love the people at Cafe Mix.  They have the best lamb Gyros in town.  They also have some Greek-American specialties like a gyro Philly cheesesteak sandwich that rocks.  Their Greek fries with Feta cheese are soooo good.  They have great Kabob salads and the Mediterranean Sampler is a must.  Their Baklava is made with and pistachios.  Yummm.  This restaurant has become a family favorite.  You have to go there!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has GREAT food!  It has been super busy when I have gone for lunch, however they do a good job of getting the food out quickly.  Definitely quality ingredients are used and you can taste the authenticity.  Only reason I can't give 5 stars is the price.  The plates are pricey for lunch, but you can still get out of there for under 10 bucks, but it's hard. They do offer discounts to Boeing and government employees.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the nice little cafe style place.  And the food was fantastic.  We will definitely recommend this place to friends and family and will stop back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Best Greek food ever! Quick service, decent prices, friendly staff! My picky kids love the chicken kabobs and rice."}
{"text":"Just drove 40 miles for my CAFE MIX fix! Not been disappointed yet. My wife and i have tried several different items and have not been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cafe Mix 5-6 times and every time the food was very good. I've tried the chicken gyro, beef gyro, greek salad, as well as the hummus. Their prices are reasonable, for $8.50 you can get a gyro and a soda. We did ask for a to-go cup and they said they charge .50. Not a big deal, but we chose not to get one. The staff is not overly friendly, but not rude. When we had lunch there today, my girlfriend had the greek salad and it went right through her. Wondering if they add MSG, does anyone know?"}
{"text":"We have been going to Cafe Mix for five+ years.  The people are always friendly, and the food is consistently amazing.  We usually order Greek salads and gyros.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious! The food is fresh and fast. I have always received excellent service. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone that enjoys a yummy gyro and salad!"}
{"text":"Great family run restaurant. The food taste fresh and is loaded with flavor. The chicken Shawarima is just Devine!"}
{"text":"Since the desert is not a mecca for Mediterranean fare, it is great to find a place that is a winner!  I walked in expecting it to be a glorified hot dog and gyro joint and what I found was closer to traditional dining experience. I ordered a salad with Gyro Meat, and my wife ordered the Chicken Shawarma plate.  Although my meal was big and delicious, I really loved the chicken shawarma that my wife got. It was seasoned perfectly, the bites were substantial size and it was moist with a nice crust. Very traditional.   Their salad was fresh and there was a good feel to the place. They also seve beer which makes it a great happy hour place next time I go.  Overall, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely spectacular! It's a nice, family owned authentic Greek restaurant that exemplifies customer service! The food is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Solid lunch time restaurant with Greek and American inspired dishes for everyone.  I had the gyro lunch combo which included a side salad and drink.  Service was prompt and the meal was tasty.  Beware of the lunch crowd between 11-12 and come in a little \"later\"."}
{"text":"The gyros are amazing and so are the fries. All of the employees are very friendly and knowledgable about the menu. The cooks are fantastic as well. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Cafe Mix is one of my favorite restaurants in Mesa, AZ!  The staff is always friendly and the food is consistenly great!"}
{"text":"Cafe Mix is the best Greek food in the East Valley. The meats are tender and well seasoned. The breads are soft and delicious. I eat here weekly."}
{"text":"Thank you, Cafe Mix, for a lovely dinner. We were hungry for Greek food, had a busy day and you were on the way home.  Our food was hot and delicious.  Gyros salad was the perfect way to satisfy my craving for Greek yumminess. Plenty of food in that order. Dressing on the side allowed me to add what amount I wanted. Pita bread pieces and Tzatziki sauce and feta cheese finished off my meal.  Hubby had the Beef tenderloin plate, currently scraping up every kernel of the divine rice. Greek salad came with his order completing his meal.  We WILL be back."}
{"text":"I had a chicken Shawarma Here and it was excellent. I wish they had a cheaper sandwich and fries combo, i would come often. Will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Flavorful and healthy! Love their shwarama chicken. Have tried to copy cat it at home to no avail. Fast, clean, casual place. Food is filling but you don't leave feeling fat and dead (if you order right). Their baklava is tasty too! Only thing is I wish they were at least open till 9! Stinks that they close so early!"}
{"text":"We have been eating at Cafe Mix since we moved to AZ in 2014.  It is fantastic.  The food is healthy and the atmosphere has a very personal touch.  They always remember us and treat us like gold.  Lunch can get busy as the Falcon Field flight students frequent Cafe Mix often, so we go at dinner time a lot when it is quieter.  I cannot say enough good things about it.  You absolutely must try it - but please go during lunch so that the evenings remain calm and quiet for us!  Haha!"}
{"text":"This is one of our all time favorite places to eat. I look forward to when my wife forgets to make something for dinner and we get to enjoy Cafe Mix. The schwarma is the best I've ever had and the hummus is also amazing. My kids are normally picky eaters but they can't get enough of this place. The owners are so gracious and pleasant to be around. The food is always too notch. My mouth is watering just writing this review. Hope my wife didn't cook tonight. Thank you Cafe Mix"}
{"text":"WOW - what a delightful and pleasant surprise to the cluttered eatery landscape! This place is wonderful. Be sure to take a friend and share the experience. The layout is more spacious than most strip restaurants. The decor is relevant but not overdone. The wait staff make the visit and journey well worthwhile. Be sure to try their iced tea mixes (as the name of their establishment implies).  Take time to meet Jo, who moves around the place in a seemingly effortless manner seeing to it that you get plenty of refills and that all is well with your order. If you decide to go, do so without any unrealistic expectations, a positive attitude and a desire for good food. That way, it will be an experience that you will be pleased with."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch spot.....great food, fast service, great food.  The chicken is succulent.  The owner cares about food quality and store atmosphere.  Always clean...."}
{"text":"The place is clean. The ambiance is great for conversation. The plate look amazingly delicious. I have eaten their food once and it was good, this is the first time I walk into the restaurant and I really like the place. Service is also very good."}
{"text":"Great food and good atmosphere.  Service is always very good.  I've been here many times and it's consistently top notch."}
{"text":"Cafe mix is delicious and the food is always fresh. The staff is always friendly! I ate here twice last week! If you want an amazing meal, go to Cafe Mix!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The owner is always there. His name is Fadel, tell him Brandon sent u :) I always get the chicken salad and add chopped pepperchinis and extra Feda. I don't think I have ever seen a cleaner restaurant. The employees are always happy and I enjoy spending money in places where they show true appreciation for the business. If everyone ran there business this way, we would see a lot more successful people. Keep up the good work guys"}
{"text":"Everything I've ever had here is great. The Chicken Kabob meat is always perfect and the gyro meat is very flavorful and never greasy or heavy. The jalapeno hummus is also fantastic. Portions are very generous and prices are great! One of my favorite restaurants in Mesa!"}
{"text":"So Delicious...I Love The Gyro Plate Here...The Place Is Nice & Clean. -Plus if you call in your order they are super quick too!"}
{"text":"Well, today was the second I've been here with my wife. It's always nice to be here. I love their food. I had gyro plate (#23) and my wife just the regular gyro (#16). It was perfect and it taste really good and healthy.  Prices are reasonable from $6-$20 of course it depends what you want. There's a lot of selection they offer.  This is a small family owned restaurant. Place is neat and cozy. They also have tv's inside. It's get crowded but it all worth the wait. Definetely one of my favorite spot to eat.  I would recommended this place to other. Always 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Only place I could eat every single day! I always get the same thing...Greek salad with chicken kabobs. The  pita that comes with the salad is hot and delicious. I also love  their French fries!! Everything I have ever ordered here is fresh and very tasty! The owners and servers are very kind. I like dining in and getting togos. Oh and  when I get wine it's always a nice big glass. A+ all around!"}
{"text":"The food is darn good and while you can go sit down and get served, this rather small restaurant has a distinct cafeteria vibe, so I've never expected stellar service from this place. I can't speak for the pita sandwiches, but their meat platters are wonderful and so is their hummus. This place is on the top of our list for mediterranean spiced meat in the east valley.  Unfortunately they have adjusted their hours so they close at 8:30 pm every day that they are open. Why???? And why did that employee have to argue with me when I called to inquire about the closing time? It's just a disappointment. Moral of the story is to do an early dinner or take out for lunch."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for a really long time as it is close to home. Finally tried it the over night with my entire family and everything was so good from the gyros to the lamb chops. The prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was nice. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Although there is another Greek-American restaurant closer to us, we go out of our way to frequent this place. It's a quaint little restaurant in an unassuming location with surprisingly great food. We have become dine-in and to-go regulars over the past year and a half due to the quality of food. The interior is clean and decorated very nicely, and has a relaxing feel to it. I have an appreciation for their mom and pop ownership feel, and they really seem to care about their food, and prepare it the right way. Maybe real Greek ownership and employees, possibly family members? At least it feels that way."}
{"text":"One of my Favorite greek places that I've found in the valley, definitely in the east valley. I keep going back to the gyro meat platter and of course the Baklava to go! Service is always great and the price is decent."}
{"text":"Amazing gyros. Some of the best I have had in my whole life. Decor was classy and relaxed. Waiter was very attentive. Helped us with everything we needed. Everything about this place was amazing besides for the weird location. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"So my beau's friend John introduced us to this place, as he lives right nearby. WOW. SO good!  I have only ever eaten the Gyros, but it's SO good. The atmosphere is pretty relaxed, and the folks that work there are delightful. We often argue about how horrible the Red Wings are :) as they are from Detroit, and I'm a Coyotes fan. But it's all in good fun!  I would drive from Scottsdale to eat there!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious!  Greek fries and baklava are amazing!  Nice atmosphere and great staff."}
{"text":"Always a great lunch. Quality fresh ingredients. Friendly quick service. My favorite is the Greek Salad with the Gyro or Chicken Gyro meat. Tzatziki is tasty. Quality place!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant! Food is always perfect, tastes great & portions are just right!  Everyone is kind, professional! The employees & owner do a great job keeping it clean and well maintained!  We love to bring family & friends for a wonderful meal and great atmosphere!!!! We recommend The Mix Cafe to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"A hidden treasure in this big shopping center. The falafel here is fresh and tastier than we have had in Manhattan, Studio City and London. Salads are very good and made to order. The atmosphere is very relaxed and nice; the service is quick with sharp and attentive wait staff. V consistent. 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"UPDATE:  Since they usually take so long I started calling ahead. I had 45 minutes for lunch, so I gave them a call. It took 3 tries until someone answered the phone. I placed an order for a salad. They said it was going to be 30 minutes. 30 minutes for a salad?! I tried calling them back... and this time it took 4 tries to get ahold of them! I told them I wanted to cancel my order, and that I didn't have time to wait that long. After getting lunch somewhere else, I ended up getting a call later that I had not picked up my salad. I cancelled my order!! Who has time to wait 30 minutes for a salad?! This was my last straw with cafemix. I will not be returning.     I usually love this place, its right across the street from work and it's delicious. But last week they must have taken an order too big for them to fill since I had to wait 35 minutes for my to-go salad. They took 30 minutes for other to-go orders behind me too. If you come here make sure you have extra free time because it takes a while."}
{"text":"Very nice setup and staff. Has good natural lighting inside and is well ventilated. The gyros and salads are quite good (as well as everything else I've tried). It's a nice place to go for good, quick service and awesome food."}
{"text":"The best Greek food ever! Had their salad (which is HUGE) and chicken gyro pita. The pita was soooo good and the salad was very filling. Definitely coming again!  Their baklava... AMAZING"}
{"text":"Love this place. Their Greek salad is awesome as is their baklava. If you are around it's worth a try."}
{"text":"I work nearby at the airport, and in my short time in the area I have noticed a serious lack of decent local owned restaurants. Cafe Mix is a great relief from the boring food places that abound in east Mesa. I enjoy the basic gyro, but the best is the Greek salad with chicken kabob. The marinade is well balanced and goes all the way through the meat. No blandness whatsoever. It's got a great char on the chicken also and the salad is fresh and crisp. I would prefer a little more acidity and oregano in the vinaigrette, and a bit more feta though. Great baklava too! Definitely a top recommendation in the area."}
{"text":"What a great lunch place. It's quick, clean, good seating area and best of all it's always consistent. If you're in the mood for Greek food and are in Mesa, try this place as the food is always piping hot (try the yummy combo plates), the salad nicely presented and the baklava nice and fresh. The only set back this place has is the crowded parking as it's adjacent to a Starbucks drive through and a myriad of other fast foody restaurants. So for a non stressful lunch, get there early."}
{"text":"Authentic Greek food! The hummus was delicious and the gyros are PERFECT. They allow dogs on their front patio and bring your food to you once you order at the counter."}
{"text":"Great service and food.  I had the Greek salad with lamb......one of the best I've had.  The hummus was great as well.  Fresh ingredients, friendly staff and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this local gem in Mesa. In over 20+ trips, I've never had a bad meal, and never have I not been met with a smile.   Everything here is authentic. I consider myself lucky to have such a great establishment right down the street from me."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in the east valley.  I wish they had that fried cheese..."}
{"text":"Me and my husband eat here all the time. The restaurant is always exceptionally clean. I am very particular about where I will eat based on this. The food is amazing. Finally found a good Greek spot that's not crazy expensive. The gyros are really good. I always get the Greek chx salad and add extra feta and pepperchinis. Try it, it won't disappoint. Finish with a baklava."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best places to eat in town! The food is delish! The atmosphere is very friendly. We look forward to joking around with the owners every time we come in. We've become regulars. If you haven't eaten here before, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Good food excellent service every time we Love it.. Adela and her staff is hard working and amazing and wonderful customer service keep up the good and hard work!! We love cafe mix and we thank everyone for serving us with a smile all the time .  I just want to say all restaurants have rules and just because she's the manger doesn't mean she can twist those rules for some people!! Thank you Adela for treating all customers the same."}
{"text":"I was a bit apprehensive about this place because it looks like it could be a chain, but the food was extremely delicious and the service was very friendly. We had a few appetizers including the dolmades and hummus and they were great. Everyone had something different from the menu and they all enjoyed. I had the falafel and it was great!"}
{"text":"ALWAYS GOOD!!!  Prices are great, staff is friendly and food is delish!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The environment is clean and well designed. People are friendly. Food was fast. And it is really delicious! Definitely a little pricey but you get what you pay for, a solid $10 lunch. Will come again."}
{"text":"Best Greek Salad and Gyros in the east valley! The baklava is expensive but sooo good!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great. The gyros are good (though I feel like an ass every time I say JaiRo and they say it back as GearO), the salad is good, greek fries are awesome (just tons of Feta melted on top), and baklavaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa....  Plus, it's usually only about a ten-minute wait for pick-up and the owners are pretty friendly.  Not open on Sunday, which kinda sucks."}
{"text":"First time here, great service and authentic food. I got the chicken kabob salad and the salad is delicious and the chicken hot and tasty."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Cafe Mix! We have been going since it opened and it never gets old or changes at all. We used to go to Bellagio that is in the same complex but after we discovered Cafe Mix we haven't been back at all. My husband always gets the Greek salad with gyro and says it's the best salad he's ever had. I switch it up between the gyro and chicken dinner plate, the falafel wrap and the gyro. The crispy chicken salad is really good too. The owner is always very nice and I am impressed with his customer service and memory. We didn't get a part of our takeout order once and I called just to tell them the mistake and then the next time we ordered he remembered and gave us the same thing for free with extra pita bread! We rarely get to actually go there and eat being that our son is 15 months old and a handful but last time we did the owner gave us two pieces of their delicious baklava for free! Love this place and everyone should try it!"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! The staff are nice and friendly, as well as being quick with their food service. The seating arrangement is a little annoying when it gets busy because people in line are hovering over you at your table. The only reason they get 4 stars is the cost here is pretty high, it averages me around $12 to get a Gyro with a side and a soda."}
{"text":"Great food, I love the veggie wrap and the Mediterranean plate. Here is what I love about Cafe Mix; the best falafel around, it doesn't have the consistency of saw dust as many restaurants overcook it. I love good falafel. The service is great, it is not a chain restaurant, best of all it's spotless. You can see the kitchen and the chefs are in clean uniforms and the kitchen sparkles."}
{"text":"Greek restaurants and I have a relationship akin to one of my neighbor's as a young boy- I couldn't pronounce his name when I first met him, and I was kinda afraid because he was so different and from another country.  It would take about 5 years for me to summon the courage to try to be friends, and my first attempt ended in disaster.  Grisly dried out bits of alleged lamb in some strip mall in Minnesota.  I swore, never again.    Time has a way of healing all wounds however, and my heart would try to open up again.  I wanted to be friends again.  We found out we had a lot in common!  Strong, bold flavoring is how we like to live.  We want to live balanced lives, so yea don't throw solely some gamey meat in like that likely-abandoned \"restaurant\" in MN, put in some onions, tomatoes.  And you always have to have your friend that is the life of the party, Tzaziki!  He's the kind of friend that no matter how much you hang out, you never want to say no when he wants to hit the town.  Once I became friends with my neighbor, I realized Hey, these people are EVERYWHERE!  I have been living in a box.  What a wonderful world with so much variety and life!  Little Greek restaurants are popping up all over the country the last decade or so it seems.  I have been friends with some and sworn enemies of others.  However, I have not forgotten my lesson as a young boy that realized there were more than just Asians and Caucasians in the world- Cafe Mix, will you be my friend too?  Pulling up to Cafe Mix is a relaxing experience.    A colorful depiction of a Chicken Greek Salad surrounded by Pita greets you, tempting you right away.  Opening the doors, there is a vast ceiling with a very nice beige color, and depictions of Greek culture and art are everywhere.  Tasty, Healthy, Food! is blazoned above the cooking area, and you can watch the chef at his work on the grill.  It could probably seat about 50 people, but the layout makes you feel like it could fit double that.    As much as I love the Gyro however, I wanted to try out as much as I could.  Eying the Mix's Combination, which would net me Lamb gyro, Chicken Gyro-style, Tenderloin Kabob, and Chicken Kabob, I felt that was the broadest way to get acquainted.  At 11.99, it included basmati rice, salad, hummus, and pita.  Thinking the price was lower at a place I frequent in Phoenix, I inquired if the serving size was enough for me ( I audition for the Before Guy in those Slim-Fast commercials ).  I literally overhead the table behind me laugh, and the server smiled with quiet confidence, saying \"I'm pretty sure it will be enough.\"  I also ordered a bottomless fountain drink/ ice tea, for 1.75.  My girlfriend was less adventurous, opting for the Bacon Cheeseburger adding fries, with the burger being $6.50 and another $2.50 to add fries and a drink.  This confidence came to be well-founded.  After getting some green tea and picking our seats, barely a minute passed before I was brought the salad that came with my meal.  It was a worthy rendition, with a great balance of Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, olives, feta cheese, onions.  Not too much dressing which I approved of, the olives and onions gave it a tart kick, balanced by the cheese.  I forgot to take a picture, but the serving size was much larger than most salads thrown in with your entree.  Our entrees arrived, and my Mix Combination looked great, with a faint vapor rising from the freshly grilled meats.   I tried the lamb first, and was satisfied, but not that amazed.  It had the right flavor, and I wouldn't say it was dry, but, it was approaching it.  Then the beef tenderloin- this was nicer, with a nice juicy pinkish center.  I would've liked the outside to be almost charred but that is a personal preference, this had more than adequate moisture and definitely a valued member of this meal.  The chicken-gyro style was better than the lamb, but still not quite out of this world.   Then the chicken kabob came and put all the others to shame.  I don't understand how, but it put up plenty of resistance when I cut it with my knife, but it came apart in my mouth.  This was the best chicken I've had in my life that was under $10 at a restaurant.  Just crazy good.    The rice was straightforward, cooked competently.  The hummus was colorful, but not as flavorful as some I've had before, and the pita bread was also fine, but was almost a little too hard for dipping in hummus.   My girlfriend's burger was fine, with a hand-molded patty, bun finished on the grill with some butter, bacon nice and crispy.  Lettuce, tomato, pickles and onion also packed in, I'd say this burger is about equal to the burgers you could get at Red Robin.  The fries were out of this world!  Seasoned perfectly, crunchy on the outside and pillowy wonderfulness within.  Sometimes, first impressions are so good that you know you will be friends for life,  which I believe Cafe Mix can be.  Work a little on the sides, and 5 stars is in your future!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love. This is a great place to eat. Owner is almost always on sight and working and quality of food and service is fantastic. Seriously one of my favorite places for lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing staff! I eat here at least once a week and have never been dusapointed. Healthy and very good!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The gyros are excellent and so are the prices!  I think it is family owned, which makes it even more appealing to me.  Another plus is that the restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. PHENOMENAL food. Always happy employees. even though this venue is a bit on the small side it's functional and they are super fast and efficient. It's nice to have a good place for great food so close."}
{"text":"We've lived here for a year now and I always see this place when going to Walmart.  Some friends told us it was good but we just never tried it until now.  We just wanted something quick but not fast food and this place came to mind to try out.  The food was really good.  I got the Chicken Gyro which was amazing and my wife got the Felafel which she really liked.  It was probably the the best Chicken Shawarma I have ever had.  I'm no expert but I've had them at some different Armenian places in L.A. and so on and I was really impressed.  It's a bummer we didnt try this place earlier but glad we know now that is so good.  I really can't wait to go back when we have more time and order some more things."}
{"text":"We have been to Cafe Mix several times and enjoyed it each time. The food is very good and the service was great!  It's not in my neighborhood so I have to make a special trip to go there. But it's worth it. The gyros are melt in out of this world good and everything else I've tried is just as good.  The young lady who served us most recently was polite, personable, helpful and efficient. Since I am usually there in the mid afternoon I generally see the same server. She has been so helpful suggesting menu items that we might like.  I have enjoyed every visit and every dish at the Cafe Mix. Highly recommend it for a casual meal!!!"}
{"text":"Unlike some people here I found that the service here is great. The staff in my experience is very friendly. They know me by name and know what I usually like ordering. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very good food I enjoyed it so much I got a nice greek sald to go to eat later!  The Service was great not pushy gave time to look at menu and food was brought out to table."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since Cafe Mix first opened up.  I love their gyros, salads, hummus, and spanakopita!  It's been nice to see the business grow and thrive over the years.  It's almost always busy when I go there at lunch time, which I think is a testament to the good food.  The owner (or the man whom I assume is the owner) is always there, usually manning the register.  Like, every lunch time I've ever been there for the past 4 years, he's been there.  He's clearly dedicated to his business.  He's kind of the serious type, not super friendly/engaging, but he's polite and efficient.  And I'm not there to pay a social call anyway... I'm there to get my lunch and eat!  The wait staff are usually quite friendly, and service is quick."}
{"text":"great fast Greek food, looking for a lunch place in Mesa, then look no further, this is your place.  The food is good and the salads are really fresh and delish, total bummer that we can't take to-go cups of tea, but them's the rules."}
{"text":"Great service. Food was very tasty. Large portion sizes and reasonable prices. All Greek too! What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Consistently great food, very affordable and quick and friendly service. The gyro meat is the best in the area."}
{"text":"This has been good restaurant for years. The original owners sold to current owners about 2 years ago and there has been no drop off in quality. We eat here 1-2 times a week. The hummus, and falafel are outstanding. The Greek salads are my favorite."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were frequent flyers here in the last few months. Today I suggested it and she told me \"never again!\" Confused I asked why. Apparently the last time we were here she saw the salad cook making a salad with his bare hands! I don't know if it was hers or another poor customers. She ate it but now gets grossed out thinking about it. They do have awesome food ( thus the 2 star) but once you see something like that you can't unsee it."}
{"text":"The cheapest trip to Greece you will ever take!!  OPA!  You need to go and see for yourself - everything is wonderful - Food Network needs to feature this place for the Falafel alone - let alone their diverse menu with a variety of everything from Greek to American style - I have never had something there I or any of my famly, friends did not like it all is really well done cuisine for little money.  The cafe decor is high end as well as the cleanliness of the place very nice!  Everyone is friendly and you can see how much pride they have in their culture throught the food itself - Greek or American.  They really accommodate you and go out of their way to make sure you enjoy yourself as well as make some great suggestions if you are new to Greek food in general.  There are few places to go these days that really hit the mark all around - it is Mesa's best kept secret - Food Network needs to pop in on them and do a feature......worth it and more thank you Cafe Mix!"}
{"text":"Cafe Mix is a quiet little Greek restaurant with fresh delicious food. I ordered the 3 lambchop plate. Which was wonderful. Fresh, tender. The rice was light and fluffy. Salad was fresh. My husband had a gyro and fries he said was pretty good. Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Cool spot.  I had the Greek salad with gyro on top. Their portion size was enormous, easily could share the salad. The salad came with a really good cucumber ranch dressing.  The highlight though was the hummus with pita bread.  The pita bread was fresh made and hot, which paired perfectly with the hummus.  The staff was friendly,  and the service was FAST!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite gems of Mesa. The service & the food was always top notch & amazing. But on Monday I stopped in and ordered my Greek Salad with chicken kabob meat & it was not the same. The chicken was not the same and was rather anemic. The lettuce was bad & the olives were not fresh but soggy.  Honestly the food used to be amazing & super fresh & everything tasted wonderful. But this was so bad I couldn't eat it. I am so disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here. Chicken shawarma pita. Best pita sandwich ever. EVAHH!!! And I've had a lot in my lifetime. I'll be back !!!!!!"}
{"text":"I think I'm preferential to Mika's in Scottsdale but the vegetables were fresh and the lamb was tasty. I'd come back again if I were in the area.   Id give it four stars for \"fast-food\" if that were an option."}
{"text":"Excellent gyros and Greek salads. The baklava is to die for! This is one of the restaurants in our date night rotation."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill recently. They are not friendly and the food is not as good, I prefer MVPita. They tend to not give to-go cups when you order a combo with a drink as well."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Cafe Mix on a regular basis for the past 2 years.  The freshness of the ingredients and the consistency of the quality are what keeps me coming back.  The salad they serve with entrees is a perfect balance of greens, onions, tomatoes and feta cheese. Steak Kabob, Chicken Kabob, Chicken Shawarma are all good consistent winners for me. The staff has always been friendly to me. Definitely one of my favorite places to go in the East Valley."}
{"text":"This place is an odd mix of a small greek restaurant and a sit down restaurant.  When you walk in you expect to go up to the counter and order but you are asked to sit at a table and be served.  Everything is very clean and the cook is all dressed up like an upscale chef with a presentation kitchen area.  The interior is more akin to a serve yourself restaurant and there isn't enough service needed to require a server to take care of you."}
{"text":"Great place to pop in and get a quick bite to eat. Friendly staff. Delicious gyros. I recommend the chicken shawarma with rooster sauce. Delicious, flavorful, spicy and wonderful. The greek fries really pack a punch so definitely share them with some friends. Dig in and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm always a sucker for some good, tasty gyros... And these ones are hot and tasty.  The service is great here, and the gyros and fries were tops.  The portions were acceptable--I've had bigger, but it was still filling enough.  Considering the dearth of good food options in the north central Mesa area, this place can definitely occupy a spot on the dinner rotation."}
{"text":"Seriously. Without a doubt the best Greek food I've ever had. Noticed I haven't reviewed this place in a while. It definitely earns its 4 1/2 star status. Workers aren't overly friendly but who cares I guess. Good flavor. Healthy ingredients. Great place!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. It's my family's go to! Fresh food, clean establishment, nicest owner. You really can't go wrong. It's always consistent, you know what you're gonna get when you come here."}
{"text":"Love this place, food is fresh, fast, affordable and the entire staff is exceptional. Added bonus: music is fantastic as well, and never too loud"}
{"text":"Small family owned place with meal options in the $10.00 range.  Easily five stars, great quality for the price.  Tender lamb, fantastic fries & lots of salad options."}
{"text":"I love this place. I usually get take-out and the food is amazing. I usually get the salad with chicken gyro meat and a piece of baklava (amazing). I didn't think I'd be able to find good Greek food in AZ (especially Mesa) but this place is sooooooo good."}
{"text":"Two words: num nums. We. Love. Cafe. Mix. We eat here at least once a week. I love the gyro and the gyro platter. The chicken kabob Greek salad is so good. Their lettuce is always so fresh and finely chopped and I love that. Eat here fo sho."}
{"text":"Good food but over priced considering that you order at the counter. Ordered two Greek salads with lamb and two ice teas. Over $30.00!  We eat Greek several times a month. Over priced! Especially since the ice tea is weak and not fresh brewed. Then they charge another 50 cents per cup to go at the end of the meal.   I doubt that I will be back."}
{"text":"Okay I have lived like 5 minutes from this place like forever...i remember when they first opened about 4 years ago. I am guilty of not going there until last week. I have missing some really good Gyros. The hUmmus was off the hook!!...perfect place for lunch or dinner with the hubbie or the kids. The portions were hefty...and the bakalava had pistachios and a really good buttery crust. They make the bakalava themselves. Overall great food, (we did wait a little bit longer than I thought we should have to order) clean, busy little spot. We will be baaacccckk!!!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I have been trying new places by our house since we moved and decided to check this place out.  Very pleased with the food!  We ordered the chicken shwarma and the chicken kabob platter, and both were delicious! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I am a big Gyros fan, but the gyros meat at Cafe Mix is the best!.  Now I not only have gyros cravings, but I have Cafe Mix cravings that any other greek restaurant will not satisfy.  Not feeling a sandwich?  Try the meat on a greek salad."}
{"text":"You don't get the kind of reviews Mix has by not being awesome! Their food is TOP NOTCH!!   I could literally live off the hummus.   It can get quite busy, but they do \"to go\" orders as well as anyone. Call them up, place an order and it will be ready by the time you can race down there. They have done a good job of loading their menu online too!   Service is always super pleasant. Parking can be tricky, but you'll figure it out and your efforts will be rewarded with the best Greek salad these side of....Greece!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but once they changed from an order at the counter restaurant to a sit down restaurant it lost most of its appeal for me to go with my family (less child friendly)"}
{"text":"Best Greek food I have had.  Ingredients are fresh and full of flavor.  My favorites are the falafel pita and Greek salad.  Service and food are both top notch for affordable prices.  Good vegetarian options as well."}
{"text":"Really. I live 2 miles from the place so I kind of took it for granted as my go-to place for a good meal. Then I realized I was eating there at least once a week and everyone I took there to eat also died over it. So, I decided to be a good customer and pay all those good meals back with a yelp review!! I'm not a huge Greek food fan, but this place could change me forever. The Greek salad with chicken shwarma (sp?) is a not to be missed love of mine. Also, the Dolmades are far far better here than anywhere I've tried. (Just ask them if they're cold...once I got them still warm...not as good). The hummus with gyro meat is PERFECT for the kids as a good dip and the meat is already tender so there's no cutting up. Perfect for when husband and I are stuffing our faces. I try to get a Gyro without getting a look from the husband because its really good but usually I've ordered too much already. The yogurt sauce is esp good. The staff is really nice and even remember our names and not to take the menu from my 3 year old too soon.  :) We usually make a huge mess too, and we never get any weird looks from the waitress. Nice people. The baklava, however, is the CROWN jewel of this place. Just right. In every way. While pregnant, I think I spent a fortune in baklava.  So, now that everyone in my close circle has heard the exact same thing, if you're looking for a reasonably priced great meal, hit cafe mix.  I've eaten here probably 20 times between take-out and eating in and it's never let me down. Oh, and the one time they forgot my baklava with my take-out order, they CALLED me and let me know I had a whole tray waiting for me to pick it up next time I was out."}
{"text":"Excellent food! We got the lamb gyro and chicken kabob entree. The staff was extremely friendly and had our order ready for pick up within less than 15 minutes- we will defiantly be going back!"}
{"text":"Really like Cafe Mix.  Routinely get salads and Greek combos.  We always enjoy our meals.  Inside service is usually good but we get takeout every few weeks.  One of our go to spots!"}
{"text":"A solid 3 star cafe with really good food. Prices most reasonable and portions generous. Premises are tidy. I had been there before but did not review it at the time. My brother in law reminded me how good it is so we went. I had the plain gyro and it was well prepared and tasty. Wife the falafel pita."}
{"text":"I work from home and Cafe Mix is my go-to for a quick to-go meal. Everything I have had is incredibly delicious. I typically get a regular gyro pita - I love the red onion and tomato and the tzatziki sauce is perfect. So much better than Pita Jungles gyros. I also sometimes order the greek salad with chicken or gyro meat - this is very filling with the pita bread included. All of their starters/apps are delicious as well - love their hummus! Definitely recommend - affordable and delicious food with a friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Blah, boring food. Had the gyros plate. The pita looked and tasted like grocery store prepackaged. The rice was flavorless. The salad was swimming in oil and vinegar and didn't have any feta cheese on it. The gyros meat was greasy.  Very disappointed and won't be able to recommend or return."}
{"text":"as i went flying into the parking lot at 829 and 30 seconds (they close at 830) they seamed a little surprised as i busted thru the door BUT i Will say they were accommodating and happy to help  good job people"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I had a small Greek Salad and the original Gyro with Greek fries for the table. All was incredible. The Greek fries were delicious but not the best I've ever had. The best was actually at a Greek festival in Gilbert (recommend). That being said, everything was served at a great temp and was all delicious. The restaurant is very clean (even the bathroom!) and has a nice decor. That being said, my husband and I did encounter one issue! While the younger male working the cash register was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING and so very sweet, the young female manager working seemed very rude. I was sitting at the bench right by the register with my daughter when the female manager began lecturing the young male working the register (he also waited later on). As he was trying to tell her that he had actually done something the way she was yelling at him to ring up an order, she walked away, not even letting him speak. It was kind of embarrassing for her (or should have been). She seemed very stand--offish and never actually greeted my husband and I or our two kids (2 and 6 months). She greeted everyone else in the restaurant and even helped another customer decide on a meal (which was kind). That being said, if my daughter even made a peep (which when she did my husband immediately shuffled her out because the female manager made us feel SO uncomfortable), she would look up and stare at us. The sweet male cashier came to us and I apologized for any inconvenience. He told us \"you're parents, you have the hardest job\" and offered to clear up some plates and get us a to-go box just so my daughter could take her fries. My daughter barely even peeped but I was so uncomfortable that I felt I needed to apologize. That sweet cashier saved our experience here. The food was great, but I would say as long as that woman is there, NOT KID FRIENDLY!"}
{"text":"I have never had Greek food before I ate here but I must say it is out of this world. I have come here three times now for lunch and it is amazing. All HomeMade and friendly. I will be coming back and will send my friends and coworkers. The prices are little high but I don't mind cause the food is well worth it. Come one come all and enjoy."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly! Food was just ok. You will be disappointed if you have been to a Greek restaurant in a major city. Nothing fancy but that was not a problem, just came for pitas and salad. Great patio."}
{"text":"This place has a ton of 5 star reviews for a reason...it's really good!  We are glad we found another good place to eat in north mesa.  The Greek salad with cabob chicken is what we got...it was a big salad with a lot of chicken. We also got the fries with cheese which were really good!  2 orders of the salad with chicken and 2 orders of the fries came to about $24 which isn't the cheapest but I feel like the quality makes it a good value.  We will be coming back here on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"I forgot my lunch and this place happened to be down the street from my office.   First the food: It was overpriced but it tasted fine. I got the greek salad with falafel.   Nothing special but not bad. I would have normally given it two or three stars.  Service: I would give zero stars. I was paying for my salad and he pointed to the take out waiting  area. I then went to grab a takeout menu to keep at my desk for future reference and said, \"you wait there\", in a very rude tone. I just told him I heard him the first time I am grabbing a menu. I will not be back, to a place that talks to their customers that way.  I also saw something that I am sure is a code violation. The male  cashier went right from the register and helped the kithchen by slicing meat. I'm pretty sure you have to wash your hands in between register and working with food, money amd cards are so dirty. I know that was the rule when I worked a short stint in food service."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food at Cafe Mix.  You order at the counter and a server brings the food to your table.  The service was fast.  The meat was nicely seasoned (I had the chicken and my boyfriend had the beef).  The rice is a little bland. The restaurant is knowledgable about food allergies and sensitivities.  We will come back."}
{"text":"This has been my goto place for Gyros since I've lived in the area, about 7 years as of writing this review.  The gyros I think are really good and I give 4.5 stars for the food.  Lately the service has changed tho, when we started dinning there they would seat you and have menus for you to order from.  Now when you get there you order up front then sit down and they bring you your food.  Still not that bad of a thing that warrants the 2 stars.  The guy that took our order was nice.   The reason for the 2 stars is because of grilled onions. Yep, grilled onions.  I asked for grilled onions when I ordered and the guy taking our order said ok. He was just going to ask the cook to make the onions grilled. When he did a lady jumped in and said \"oh we charge for grilled onions\".  Seriously.  The guy said well he already paid and wanted to just give it to me. The lady was persistent on charging me for the  grilled onions.  I had no problem paying for them but she should have backed off, educated the guy taking my order and given me the damn grilled onions.    She is the reason for the 2 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Inexpensive. Friendly service. Very satisfied. Great bang for the buck."}
{"text":"The food was really good.  My gyro was really yummy and the greek salad was tasty.  Food wise, it is definitely worth stopping in.  This place's biggest downfall is its awkwardness.  It is tries to be a hybrid between a sit down and to go place.  You could order food to go, but the register was at the back so you pretty much have to walk through the 'dining area' to order take out.  To eat in, it was a served meal with waiter staff.  The service was weird because with the size and feel of the restaurant doesn't fit it  (super casual like a rubios or rumbis).  The soda machine was right next to us (in the dining area exposed), but we couldn't fill our own drinks, we had to wait until our waitress came.  There were two waiters on staff, but only like 5 tables eating in total.  In my person opinion, they should nix the waiters, because for me, it felt awkward and forced.  Just have it where you order at the register and they call our your orders.  The venue feel is too casual for how its set up.  I may go back, but next time I will just take it to go to avoid the awkwardness."}
{"text":"Recently moved to this neighborhood and have been to Cafe Mix 4 or 5 times.  The food here is solid and the service great. The small cafe is owned and operated by a family who are always there.  The gyros and salads are wonderful and fresh. They also serve beer and wine.  Give it a try if you are looking for an inexpensive Greek meal."}
{"text":"Fresh, fast and authentic Greek cuisine! I highly recommend the greek salad and add gyro meat ($10). Their meat is slow cooked all day and freshly shaved upon ordering. It comes with two dipping sauces for a nice variety! The service is wonderful and staff is extremely friendly. The parking can be annoying around lunch time with such a tight area- try pakring by the Walmart and walking over."}
{"text":"Got take-out for the first time. The gyro was great! And packed with a lot of meat, unlike OPA Life. Will definitely go here again!!"}
{"text":"3 stars is A-OK. Tasty Gyro for lunch costing just under $7.00 with nothing else purchased.  A bit pricey but a great tasting gyro too"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Family owned and the pride shows! Gyro platter,  Lamb, or any of the appetizers - They are all awesome! There are other decent Greek places in Mesa but nothing of this quality! This is were the customer is king - Oh and the baklava!!"}
{"text":"pretty good for fast food but the salad could use some tweaking. Could not taste the feta cheese, the olives had pits and the no dip was on the salad for the pita bread."}
{"text":"Great family owned place with excellent food! It's a bad week if I don't get to visit my friends at Cafe Mix!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We come here all the time. I usually get the Mix plate. It comes with a variety of meats, pita bread, hummus, basmati rice and Greek salad. Flavors are outstanding, the meat is tender, and the basmati is perfect. And it's all affordable!"}
{"text":"Great Greek food at reasonable prices. Servers were prompt and friendly. Will be returning anytime I get a gyro craving."}
{"text":"A nice setting with enough variety of Greek food that everyone in your party can find something they will eat and enjoy.  The Spanakopita was tasty and crisp and the Baklava, though made with pistachios and not walnuts, was crisp and not soggy. The pita bread could have been softer(fresher ?)"}
{"text":"First time visit today and I got the Gyro Fries & Drink the food was pretty average greek food, well I can do better than that it was pretty good, great service and really nice environment. The price was very fair ($11.00)   The parking lot is very large and quite a few businesses so be patient when trying to locate the establishment it's kinda tucked away in a cul de sac."}
{"text":"Very good and extremely fresh! We had the Lamb And a Veggie Plate, our first visit, now we will be back weekly!"}
{"text":"Definitely our gyros go to!! I get the gyros salad (hold the pita) and I get to stay LC!"}
{"text":"Cafe Mix is my go-to Greek restaurant in Mesa. The spicy gyro hummus appetizer is a meal in itself, but I can never stop there. The Greek salad with your choice of gyro, chicken, pork or lamb are all excellent choices, as are the pita wraps and platters. I've never ordered anything here I haven't thoroughly enjoyed. The restaurant is clean, and the service is efficient and friendly. If I had to find a complaint, I'd ask for a better selection of soda, particularly diet."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the valley and definitely my favorite Greek food. Food is always fast fresh, delicious and well prepared. I come here 1-2 times a week. Everything here is good but my favorite is the Greek salad w beef kabob. Weekends is sit down w a server and week days just go through the line and get a table."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here and tried a few different basic dishes since my son had never had Greek before. The falafel and hummus were tasty, dolmades not as impressive. The gyro meat and beef kabobs were tasty. The staff was friendly and the decor was cute but both my husband and I still prefer Flaming Kabob overall."}
{"text":"Excellent Gyros! The pitas seem to be home made. The fries were fresh and hot. The service was excellent, and the restaurant was clean and very nice."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a good middle eastern option in Mesa as there are very few. The gyro meat is good and I really enjoyed the rice as well. I thought the service was fast and friendly.  However, I do feel like it is slightly over priced.  Otherwise, no complaints from me."}
{"text":"If your looking for a good gyro this is the spot. Good service,clean and nice atmosphere. They make it a nice atmosphere in the evenings,you think fast food when you pull up. But no it's a great place to sit down after you order,they even serve wine. What you might not expect at a Gyro place,IDk.. Try it out, I think you will enjoy it. I do every time, I am in there for a good Gyro. Thx"}
{"text":"Fidel is awesome! I love Cafe Mix! They have a great selection, super friendly staff, delicious Food!"}
{"text":"It's been 41/2 years since our last visit and nothing has changed. We thought a lot of time has passed and perhaps we might have a better experience today.  NOT!!!  Ya'all will be offended when I tell you this time's experience. I hope my review determines whether you make another visit or not.  As I said before, we came here today around 11:30am for lunch. We walked up to the register to order. We were not greeted with a smile from the male cashier. My friend ordered first, paid, and sat down. I ordered next. Knowing I was going to have to pay .50 cents (signs everywhere) I ordered a TO GO cup. I asked him why he charges .50 cents for TO GO cups? Do you want to know how he replied back??!! He said, \"WHY NOT?\" Seriously, sir, that is your response when a customer is asking a question? I not only got a \"WHY NOT?\" but it came along with a harsh tone and a sinister face. I replied back, \"Why not? Don't you think that sounds a little greedy?\" He said that if he would hand every customer a wax paper cup that it would cost him $5,000.00 a month and put him out of business. I countered back, \"Those cups probably only cost you .03 cents each. And you charge us .50 cents? Don't you think that is being a little unfair making .47 cent profit (minus freight)?\" He told me in a vicious tone that no one tells him how to run his business (btw,it is not your business. It is a business of your kin). I reminded him all I did was ask a question. He was the one that escalated it by his response.  Folks, this man is disrespecting all his customers and taking you for your money. How? He forces all customers to drink out of his plastic reusable drinkware if you are dining in. ~ Even when the .50 cents is paid for the TO GO cup. He doesn't give you the cup until you walk out the door. Is this normal business ethics? Have you ever seen a restaurant operate this way? I have to say NO. (I've heard of paying for TO GO foam boxes but never a wax paper cup) Not only do I think this is a crooked way to squeeze more change out of the customer but I feel the menu prices and additional charges here and there are a bit extreme for the portions served. A $10.00 lunch that consists of a sandwich and drink with no side is steep.   Let's do the math here. I researched the wholesale price of his cup. The cup cost average is .05 cents per cup. He says if he gave every customer a cup it would cost him $5000.00 a month. He would have to have 3333 customers a day in order to hand out 100,000 cups in a month. 100,000 cups cost $5000.00. Now let's check his gross profit that he makes off the TO GO cup. If he has 100,000 cups and gross profits .45 cents per cup that equals $45,000. See what I mean? Ridiculously, begrudging. We all know the price of the cup should be built into the price of the beverage. At the price of their beverages and deducting the .05 cents still leaves a marginal gross profit.   Sir, behind the register, handing out wax paper cups will not put you out of business. (If it does, you probably shouldn't be a business owner). What will put you out of business is your attitude and the way you speak to and treat your customers. The last 4 1/2 yrs I've been a Bellagio repeat customer. I am so sorry I strayed away from them today. The lunch menu prices are less expensive and the portions are bigger than Cafe Mix. The owners always smile, greet me, and come to my table when I frequent their establishment. Then they thank me when I leave. I never once heard you greet any of your customers. Nor did I hear you or your staff  say thank you when they left. My loyalty will forever stay with Bellagio when I crave a gyro.  The above review was submitted around 4pm on Friday May 16th. It is now Sunday May 18th. I have been very ill in bed since Friday evening. I find it suspicious. The only food I ingested all day long on Friday was the sandwich at Cafe Mix. Friday afternoon, I became ill. My stomach started to rumble. It was in my intestines. Cramping began. Diahrrea and vomiting by late evening. All day Saturday I could barely move and stayed in bed. I could not drink or eat anything. I was still having stomach rumbles, diahrrea, and vomiting. Today, Sunday, still uncomfortable and symptoms exist. The vomiting/diahrrea has subsided a bit. My stomach/intestines still making LOUD noises. Wonder how I got sooo sick? Hmmmm? I will be going to the doctor tomorrow. I want him to run a blood panel. 05/19/2014 UPDATE: Ended up in the Emergency this morning. My symptoms worsened. After many tests, x-rays, IVs, and morphine for pain I was diagnosed with Gastroenteritis. Coincidence or not, hmmmmm? Google the diagnosis if unfamiliar.  12/09/14 Sarah C, you quoted the viral transmission. Now please inform everyone the bacterial or toxin transmission which can cause gastroenteritis. Please research facts Sarah C before posting."}
{"text":"This was our first time going to Cafe Mix, didn't know what to expect but it was really good. It's a small place but pretty clean and nice vibe. We didn't have to wait to be seated and our waitress was nice, she brought our drink with a blink of an eye and our meal arrived very quick. We ordered a regular lamb gyro, Greek salad with lamb kabobs and baklava and everything was super tasty! They served really good portions, the meat was tender and juicy. The baklava was a little bit on the sweeter side but nevertheless it was a great experience.Oh and they have good prices, affordable meals. We will go back soon! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Heading back again today, yes that makes twice this week so far. Cafe Mix has delicious food and the atmosphere is amazing. Love their beef and lamb gyros but the shawarma is mouth watering.  If you are in the area stop by, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good food and always ready fast and when they tell you! Have gotten a gyro and the chicken kabab salad."}
{"text":"First try here.  I ordered the combo which came with 4 different meats.  I really like the gyro meat and the beef and chicken kabobs were good also.  I personally didn't care for the gyro chicken.   You order at the counter but then the staff brings your food to your table.  The entire staff was very nice and took good care of us.  My meal came with a salad and rice also.  It was a nice touch that they bring the salad out 1st.  The salad was also very good, but could use a little less dressing.    There was a also a portion of humus and pita bread, so this was a pretty filling meal.  A great surprise was that they had beer on tap.  Nothing fancy but hey at least they have it.  I will try them again in the near future and probably just go with a gyro sandwich since that is my favorite any way."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but I don't think it is near as good as the price tag. I ordered the Greek burger. The lamb was delicious but I think they could use better bread. My wife orders a chicken gyro that she said tasted good but it wad a little dry.   We also had our kids go and do not order off the kids menu unless it's a gyro! It is overpriced and much lower quality than the adult menu"}
{"text":"I could never say enough good things about this place in 1 review. Service: Unbeatable. Food: Superior. Value: Excellent. Some of the best gyro meat I've ever had. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I'm glad we tried this place! We did a Togo order. The beef was really good, as was the humus, rice and salad. The falafel was just ok, but everything else was good and they gave us plenty of hot bread."}
{"text":"Always have the best experience here. Called in at 8:05 forgetting they close at 8 and he was more than happy to whip up my salad for me!! Love love love cafe mix. You never get a bad meal or bad company!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Coming from California I was expecting to pay a lot more for this meal. Couldn't believe the price!  Amazing and so was the food. I'll be hitting this place every time I come to AZ on vacation."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place! The owner is as sweet as her baklava which she makes by hand! Everything is so flavorful, healthy and authentic. If I could cook like this, I would never leave the house!"}
{"text":"We love their gyros and Greek salad (with chicken or gyro meat), the steak sub was also very good. The service is excellent, food is served hot off the grill and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is great, kind of hidden but you won't forget it once you eat there. I love the Greek salad with chicken the most. The chicken is seasoned perfectly and not dried out, the salad has all fresh ingredients and the dressing is so good! The pita bread that comes with it is delicious too. I've tried the hummus and gyros here as well and they were all very tasty. The people are friendly and get your food out quick even when they are packed (which is normal at lunch time). It's always a good experience eating here and picking up lunch."}
{"text":"The Gyros are very good. Greek Salad is the best with Chicken. Sandwiches are good as well. Greek fries are great."}
{"text":"Great place to have lunch or for carry out (atmosphere is fair, so don't go there for a nice, sit-down dinner). Food is excellent, and the staff is very nice. I like the traditional gyro, and my wife goes for the gyro salad. The babaganoush is great too!"}
{"text":"Cafe Mix is a small Greek/Mediterranean restaurant in a retail strip at Greenfield and McKellips. The exterior is as you would expect. The interior was clean, with several tables and two televisions with local sports on.  Running late from work, I stopped in for some take out. It was 815, and they closed at 830. The owner was at the order counter and welcomed me, not at all bothered by the last minute order. She was kind and friendly, chatting with me as I waited for my food.  I had a veggie pita and spanakopita. The pita was ok, but not my favorite. Lots of lettuce and a runny tzatziki that made it sloppy to eat. The little spanakopita triangles were tasty and fresh. You could tell that they were homemade, and the puff pastry was delightfully flavored and crunchy. My husband had the lamb kabob plate. He ate the whole thing but said it was \"ok\". So, I don't really know the verdict! We finished with a baklava. Again, the pastry was crunchy, yet also soft where it needed to be. The honey and nuts we're perfectly layered, and it was not runny, nor sloppy to eat.  I would probably try other items on the menu next time, but I will eat at Cafe Mix again."}
{"text":"Another short review.  I ordered the falafel wrap.  Falafel was good, and a decent price.  Service was unfriendly, but good enough.  The people I was on lunch with sang this place's high praises, but I didn't find it anything special, and don't have any eagerness to come back. Maybe, being from Michigan, I have a huge pick of really good Middle Eastern restaurants and am spoiled."}
{"text":"Great food.  And very healthy.  Reasonably priced and close to my home.  Parking sucks though."}
{"text":"Yeah, still the best I've ever had. Always consistent with quality. I continue to try the gyro meat any place I find it available. I've even cooked it at home! Still, nobody has better flavors than cafe mix!   I keep trying to convince all my friends to come in :)  I will say that these people have never been rude to me, nor have I ever seen them behaving rudely to anyone else. And, I don't recall ever seeing \"signs everywhere\" stating that to-go cups are fifty cents.... However, a man can run his business any way he wants. A customer can choose to return, or not return. Pretty basic.   If a fifty cent charge for a cup is so disturbing to you that you have to go and spend your free time researching the cost and calculating the math for the sole purpose of trying to make someone else look bad, you're only fooling yourself. You're the one who looks bad.   Cafe Mix, you guys are awesome and you know it.   Oh and......   \"Norovirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis among adults in America, causing greater than 90% of outbreaks.[5] These localized epidemics typically occur when groups of people spend time in close physical proximity to each other, such as on cruise ships,[5] in hospitals, or in restaurants.[1]\" -Wikipedia  That is all."}
{"text":"Fast service and delicious food! I do a lot of take out because I have small children. Ordering over the phone is easy and they have it ready fast! The Greek salad is the best I've had. The yummy white sauce on the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich makes it so good! Also, try the fries, the seasoning is so good! I love Cafe Mix and recommend it to everyone! The staff is friendly too!"}
{"text":"So obsessed with my lunch here today! I decided to be *healthy* and get a Greek salad but I cannot turn down gyro meat.. it was $10 total (no drink) for a pretty large portion, I didn't finish it all. The gyro meat was perfectly seasoned and delicious. The pita break on the side was hot and fresh & the tzatziki was delish. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!! Excellent cuisine and staff are friendly and efficient. This particular area of town is a little thin on healthy restaurants so I was so excited to find Cafe Mix. Chicken salads are wonderful as is everything else"}
{"text":"Same delicious food, but to me, a major menu change!  On their salad menu you can get a side of any of their meats, and until recently, that included their smaller Greek side salad.  This is the perfect lunch size salad. Now, they won't let you order a side of meat on the side salad, forcing you to order the Large salad or go w/o the meat. So, i got it w/o and they lost out on the revenue!    When asked why I couldn't get gyro meat on my smaller salad I was told there was a conflict in the kitchen.  Really folks, over a $2.25 order of gyro meat!    This is certainly not customer service, so I had to take away some stars"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night and it looked pretty busy. My family sat outside which may have led to the poor service We ordered: -Baba Ganoush - Shwarma - Gyro with fries - Sprite  - Philly Cheesesteak  The food  all came out really quickly. The baba ganoush was okay, I've never had it before, and we didn't like it. The pita bread was definitley not enough for how much baba ganoush we had. Also, the pita bread was kinda stale. On the food: Shwarma: 3 stars I didn't think it was good.  I've never had it before, but my mom thought it was okay. Philly Cheesesteak: Really good. Not generous amounts of meat, but the bread on the sandwhich was to die for!  My gyro and fries: 5 stars! It was HUGE and completely chock full of meat, onions, tomatoes, and heaps of tzatziki.  The meat in the gyro was seasoned great but a little dry. The fries were honestly one of the best things there. They were hot, and crispy, and fluffy on the inside. They were also seasoned really well and not greasy.   CONS: Fries, drink, and gyro combo added up to $10 which in my opinion is a little pricey for a gyro.  - Not great service. Maybe it's because we sat outside and we were the only ones outside.   Really great. We will defenitley be here again"}
{"text":"I would like to update my review as I spoke with the owner when I picked up Togo for myself and my wife. I noted how clean the visible cooking area was and he showed me the recent A rating from the health dept. Very impressive!"}
{"text":"Great experience. We've been several times and have always enjoyed it. They weren't busy at all which stinks for the business owner but is great for us since we got quick snappy service. Food was great we enjoyed it. Greek fries are great with the oil side. Loved it."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once alone and once with my wife. Both times, the food was absolutely excellent and consistent. You should go here, very reasonable prices, very authentic Greek/Medi food. The staff are always attentive, polite and prompt.  Gyros wraps and hummus are on point. Coming from the bay area california, I know it when I taste authentic and this place is it. Very unassuming in a stripmall across from a starbucks, but some of the best local Greek/medi food I've had."}
{"text":"I'm a little embarrased to say that the girls in here know my man and I by order. It's sufficient to say that we head over to this amazing place quite frequently, and I don't see that every changing.  The salads are so amazing, that I find myself literally craving them in the middle of the day. Gyro meat is to die for good, and the mix combination plate gives you a sample of everything.  I typically either go with the combo for two, or the lo carb chicken plate, then I kinda defeat the purpose and order a side of pita bread (order the greek pita, so much better than the thin pita).  Also, greek fries, you might ask, \"what are those?\" Order them. Now.  PLUS, Blue Moon on draft? I mean cmon, you must go; but don't go when I go because I enjoy having the quiet moment to enjoy the most amazing greek food to ever touch my lips."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken gyro. The price was inexpensive which was great. However, when I took a bite in the gyro, I found it odd that I had pickles in my gyro. Maybe it's a speciality or an Arizona thing?   Not sure, but I have tasted better gyros.  A+ for customer service though!"}
{"text":"Yummy. Visited during lunch with a co-worker. Had the chicken shawarma and Greek salad combo. Reasonably priced and pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I started out with the Spanokopeta... it would have been really good, except, either the fat that they fried it in wasn't hot enough, or it needed to be changed!  The appetizer was \"dripping\" grease.    The next \"deduction\" occurred when they brought out the child's meal that was ordered for a two-year old.  Mom ordered chicken strips and fries, and they brought them to the table (before they brought the rest of the food) and they were so hot, Dad burned his fingers trying to break them into bite size pieces.  IMAGINE if they had been given directly to the two year old.  We would probably have gone to the ER!  When the rest of the food came, though, it was really good!  I loved my gyro, and Mom's sampler platter looked really appetizing.  Dad's food also looked good enough to eat.  I will probably go back, but I don't think I will order the Spanokopeta again."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, primarily the Greek salad with either of the chicken options.  Small beer and dessert selection. Service is okay. Sometimes it seems like everyone is standing around, but they're always friendly."}
{"text":"Lamb kabob plate with humus, rice and a delicious Greek salad.  Chicken gyros for my two comrades.  Very tasty and surpassed expectation.  $49 with tip.  Very busy at lunchtime but the food came out  in 10 minutes.  The lamb was cooked well and flavorful.  The comrades loved the salad."}
{"text":"I'm always surprised when I've been to a spot multiple times and hadn't done a review.   This place is the best Greek food I know of in all of East Mesa. Everything I've ever had here is great but I always go back to the beef/lamb giro combo. Great fresh Greek food with fantastic fries.   It's owner-operated which is also a big plus. You can tell they put their heart and soul into what they do there. They take pride in the quality of their food."}
{"text":"It took me a while to warm up to this place. My friend kept dragging me here because she loves the gyros. I'm the kind of person where I find one thing on the menu that I absolutely adore... and then I order it every time I go back... and often find myself craving it at random hours of the night.  Well last week I found that one item on the menu that is going to make me keep coming back here.   I definitely suggest this place for more cautious eaters (like me) that maybe aren't so sure about Greek food... since they also have American selections... and you can slowly ease into the Greek side of things."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get lunch during work hours.  Their gyros are fresh, fully packed with incredible ingredients, and come with a side of fries or salads.  Their plates and salads are enough for two meals, or to share with another person.  They are quick on getting your meal ready and either served to you at your table or for take out.  My work is 15 minutes away, by the time I get there my food is ready for pick up.  There is seating inside and on their small patio.  The wait staff is friendly and quick to assist.  The place is clean and you are able to observe your food being made.  I don't like the parking lot.  It is located in a small shopping area northwest of Walmart and is surrounded by Starbucks, a bank, Jimmy Johns, a mobile store, etc where you have to share spaces with all these patrons.  Getting in and out can be very tricky, and you do need to be careful because some people aren't paying attention to other drivers or pedestrians.  Another issue is the size of the cafe.  You can be sitting very close to another table, to the point you are touching elbows with a stranger.  Also, during the lunch rush the line can go out the door which means if you are sitting down eating your meal, people might be hitting the back of your head with their body or purse while waiting their turn to pick up or order their food.  It can get very claustrophobic, but worth a try.   My two favorite meals are the #18 with a Greek salad or #24 with a Greek salad.  The baklava is good but such a small piece for the price."}
{"text":"This is such a nice little find! The food was fresh, well seasoned, expertly cooked and served promptly.  I had the lamb kebabs medium rare.  They were tender and simply delicious.  My spouse's fries and burgers were very good.  Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"One of the best Greek salads I've had--dressing mixed in and salad greens and feta cheese are chopped for easy eating. Dressing is well balanced. All ingredients are very fresh. We like the gyros and the chicken kabobs. Their hummus is very good too."}
{"text":"Great food Great staff. My 1st place i call when I want easy healthy food to go. Always delicious!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, an innovative menu, cozy/classy atmosphere, friendly and fast service, all from a family owned and operated business: all in all, one of my favorite places to eat.  The Mediterranean fare here is second to none in Mesa. Everything on the menu is vibrant, fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced. The wait staff and chefs are all nice and helpful, and as soon as you walk in the door you feel like part of their Big Greek Family. Personally, no matter what else I get, I always get at least one lamb gyro. These guys make it right--the meat is succulent and spicy, the tzatziki sauce gives it that herbal and soothing compliment that lamb needs, and the fresh onion and tomato on top make it a showstopper. The best lamb gyro's in Mesa, no contest. I'm also a huge fan of their hummus here (one of the thing's I judge any Middle-Eastern or Mediterranean restaurant on). I mean really, it's grade A hummus, it beats the monsterously overpriced artisan batches you can buy at AJ's Fine Foods. And since that's just like Greek ketchup, the real food here is just off the charts. They have some very interesting menu items that set them apart from your usual Greek restaurant. One of them is a Philly cheese steak with lamb gyro meat (which is sooooo good) and another is a super low-carb meal of 3 exceptional kabob meats with hummus, melitzanosalata (hummus-like eggplant dip), and a savory Greek herb-salad (that I can't remember the name to..). Their alcohol and wine list is moderate, with quite a few tap brews and some nice bottle selections of wine to pair with your meal. Oh, and they also have some of the best salads in Mesa! If you're not into exotic food they have familiar standbys, if you're on a diet it's about the best place to eat out, or if you're just a discriminating foodie with an appetite for a little taste adventure... they will become a frequented location once you try it. Cafe Mix is a welcoming, satisfying, family-friendly dining experience that's easy on your wallet and guaranteed to leave you smiling."}
{"text":"Food is great!!!!!!!!!!!  The problem is you can't get what you ordered.  We ordered Gyros and were served a chicken dish.  We asked for no onions on another dish and it came out with onions.  We asked to have the food orders corrected.  They made the Gyro correctly but the onions were still on the one order.  We saw the owner so we asked to speak to him.  He said he couldn't good help and if we didn't like the food to get out.  All we were asking for was what we ordered.  We won't go back.  The help was nice but the owner is RUDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just love this place. The food is soo good, fresh, tasty, and amazing.  I think my mouth is watering!!!"}
{"text":"Decent gyro nothing rave worthy, the Greek salad is really great, very fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Best Greek I have had.  Love the Greek Chicken salad. Italian Chicken salad is also delicious with a greek twist. The Hummus is the best I have had. We go here at least once a week and the staff is always great and the service is very fast."}
{"text":"I would not say I have a huge taste for greek food.  Tried the place while passing by and it sure hit the spot.  Staff, food, wait times and the environment were all to my satisfaction!  I will certainly be coming back soon and testing out my taste buds on something more daring."}
{"text":"I have been going to Cafe Mix every week for the last year and a half and have yet to have a bad meal or service.  Most of the time takeout but when we do go in we are treated like family.    Saw one review that knocked their food and service and I honestly don't get that review.    I can tell you everything tastes 100% fresh and perfectly seasoned.    You won't be disappointed in Cafe Mix!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch with my family here today and it was outstanding.  I had the chicken kabob pita wrap with fries and everything was excellent.  The pita, veggies, and tzaziki tasted very fresh and the chicken and fries were full of flavor.  My mom and dad had the BLT pita wrap and gyro and raved about them.  My Lebanese grandma had the tabouleh and she said it was the second best tabouleh she has ever had (after her big sister's recipe).  My eleven month old daughter enjoyed sampling all of our meals too.  I am sometimes nervous trying new restaurants with the baby in tow but we had a very family friendly experience.  The service was great and the atmosphere was very pleasant.  I am excited to have found a great restaurant nearby.  We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch!!! Greek salad was so delicious!!! The gyro meat melted in your mouth. They cut it right off the spit, which is the only way to eat this meat!!"}
{"text":"I think 5 stars aren't enough for this place.  I had lunch here yesterday and tried the Gyro Plate (23) that comes with rice, humus, pita bread, and Greek salad for starters.  EVERYTHING was superb and AMAZINGLY delicious!  I have never had such authentic Greek food in America.    This place is extremely clean, the staff is polite, service is great! Theme on the inside is also very nice!   Today, I went back around 4pm and tried #23 again! There's something about the rice! So delicious and great service.  If you're in this area this place is a must!  Update:  So, now I've tried the mix grill, chicken kabob, and Baklava; all exceptionally amazing! I've never had this kind of Baklava, it's very different and much more delicious than what you might find ordinarily.  The manager was kind enough to offer it to me complimentary ! Guys/gals, please visit this place at least once, you won't regret the experience."}
{"text":"The taste of the food is fine, but for a family owned place I expected something above and beyond the chain greek places.  My biggest complaint is the portion sizes - for $9 I can get much more food from My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. And if I go to Niros' Gyros, I can get more food and way better flavor for my money."}
{"text":"Love this place and the food l first came here a couple of years ago and I am a regular for lunch now ..they even recognize my voice when I call in my order ..the gyros are better than the ones I had in Germany and the staff is wonderful ..must try and it helps that it's close to work"}
{"text":"I stopped at Cafe Mix for lunch.  For a newer pad site restaurant I was somewhat impressed with the warm atmosphere.    I ordered a Gyro special which came with choice of side.  I went with the Greek salad which was pretty good...fresh, crisp lettuce, nice dressing and authentic kalamata olives.  The Gyro itself was good, plenty of meat, tzatziki dressing, lettuce and tomato.  The service here was prompt and efficient if not overly friendly.  If you're in the McKellips & Greenfield area there are not alot of food choices and I would say this is probably one of the better ones."}
{"text":"I saw a review on here knocking Cafe Mix, and I wanted to get on here and ask why? Do you have nothing better to do with your life? Cafe Mix pumps out amazing food that is always high quality.   Cafe Mix place has the BEST Gyro meat, this coming from a person that has been to Greece. You will not be disappointed with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"My second visit was even delightful. A Baklava treat which we couldn't resist. It was a lovely evening to be with my wife. How cute can a YumYum couples be? :)"}
{"text":"So I've gone a couple of times after my last review. We even dined in & tried their Baklava - that experience was nice. But my last visit was awful. So a co-worker of mine and I ordered our food to go. Unbeknownst to me if YOU ORDER A TAKE OUT, YOU ARE  NOT ALLOWED TO DINE IN. We were meeting up with our old boss and we knew our time was gonna be limited. I ordered my food  to go with the intention of dining in and just wrapping my food to go when I have to leave. BIG MISTAKE!!! The owner proceeds to lecture me when I went to grab my take out (mind you, I just tipped his staff $3) about how I shouldn't order \"to go\" if I had every intention to dine in. Of course it took me by surprise because I didn't really understand what the big deal was and why he was upset at me? I wanted it to go because I knew my time was limited and I wasn't about to waste more paper products by asking for a to go styrofoam. As he lectures me and raises his voice because clearly he's upset about something. I'm still confused because he's accusing me of knowing what his rules were! So I asked him \"what happens when I can't finish my food?\" He responds with \"then you ask for a take out box!\" So I responded, \"aren't I eliminating that process by just asking for my order to go?\" So he raises his voice at me and with my old boss next to me trying to order her food now.  My old boss was trying to figure out at the same time if she should order her food to go since it looks like he's denying us a table. She told him we didn't know and reminded him that many of our co-workers from our company dine in & order here often. He proceeds to tell her that she can order to dine it then looks at me says \"this is my rules and you did not follow it. I told your friend what I told you so she knows my rule and you still disobeyed it. Please don't do it again and I will let you dine in with your take out!\" I was flabbergasted! I honestly didn't know what to say to him. I get that he's trying to cut cost. I'm sure the \"to go\" styrofoam are more costly but having to waste paper plates and Styrofoam's would cost more because you're wasting 2 items oppose to just 1. They both will be in the trash can after use. Needless to say, I have not come back nor have every intention of coming back."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in the east valley. I always get the gyro wrap combo w/ fries and a drink. Friendly service and quality food."}
{"text":"Always great food and smiling faces! Heathy, delicious, and fast food. We love this place."}
{"text":"less than stellar experience. greeted and sat down and drinks were taken right away but then after saying we needed a minute to order we sat for long enough for me to contemplate leaving because the waiter walked past the table 3 times and said nothing. then the other waitress walled by took the order. I asked for a regular gyro. she misinterpreted that as the gyro plate where everything is separate.   not long after the order was taken we are brought 2 salads. I realized our food came with the option of salad or fries, but we're never asked. It wouldn't have been much issue but I am allergic to peppers and there were bits of banana pepper in the salad.   the food was ok. not what I ordered per se. it was a gyro but on a plate. when I said a regular gyro I meant the kind in a pita, not the kind with the meat and pita on separate plates.   my wife's chicken shwarma was a bit over seasoned.  just an overall below average experience. I have been there a few times before and it's always just average for a Mediterranean place. this time I am deciding to avoid the place from now on. food tastes good but not worth the annoyance"}
{"text":"Outstanding atmosphere with a groovy vibe. Super clean. Food is fresh and visually interesting. Wine and 4 beers on tap plus bottles. 5 Stars because how could it get any better?"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Salads are delightful and everything else I've had gets an A+.  The former Owners were not the friendliest but the food was divine.  The new owners are great, but have changed up some things.  Still good but not exactly as it was."}
{"text":"We were meeting an old high school buddy for lunch so we sought out this place and were pleasantly surprised.  The food was excellent and our friend who was a bit more of a mediterranean cuisine fan than we were, loved his plate of food.  Service was great, staff was pleasant and we would return here again.  Just across the corner from Commemorative Air Force Museum at Falcon Field in Mesa, AZ."}
{"text":"This is a family favorite for us and our adult kids. The service is always great, and the food is even better. We particularly love the combo dinner for two, which is salads, an assortment of meats, rice, pita bread, and sauces for $25. The meats are savory, flavorful and delicious. The rice is always perfect with a hint of saffron. Baklava is included, and it is just as good (maybe better) as my Lebanese grandmother made with all the aunties."}
{"text":"The chicken is to die for. not sure how they can cook it and still come out so juicy. I am from California and own a property in Arizona. As I was visiting, the restaurant was highly recommended by a friend of mind and it lived up to the hype. Now you guys need to open a restaurant in the bay area. totally recommend.  Zaid"}
{"text":"So this place was definitely a four star restaurant until my last visit. I was on my way from work to meet my fiance for a quick lunch date. So trying to be prepared for the lunch hour, I called and ordered our food ahead of time just in case there weren't any seats upon our arrival. When we got there we paid and found one of the few seats left. So we sat and enjoyed the food and as we were leaving I went to hand a piece of silverware back and as I did the cashier, who I assume is the owner let me know we could not have boxed food within the restaurant. I could understand if we brought it in from another establishment, however we just paid and left a tip and now we can't eat the food you just prepared inside on a hot summer day in Phoenix. There are no signs posted stating this information.  Aside from this the food is good."}
{"text":"I saw the reviews and thought I couldn't go wrong but sadly I was not impressed. Didn't KNOCK my socks off as the other reviews. I had the chicken gyro salad, it was good but not INCREDIBLE as the other reviews boast. The dressing was missing that robust, tart and tangy dressing I'm used to with Greek food. The chicken was overloaded with cardamom, I love this spice and cook with it A LOT but it was so much that I'll probably take a break from using it for awhile (and wishing for a stick of gum because its all I taste). Not a total wash, would like to give them one more chance but won't be running there. Maybe they had an off day? I still love Gyro House in Mesa the best in all my Greek food travels for gyros and gyro salads. Not completely bashing them so calm down Mix \"groupies\"."}
{"text":"Yum!  We've been here a few times and LOVE this place!  The Hummus & tabouleh are super yummy and the baklava is delish...if you order the greek salad and you dont like things super spicy - have them hold the chopped pepperocinis."}
{"text":"Great food with healthy options.  If you're \"done\" with large chain boring options and desire a unique menu, you've got to try this Greek & American Cafe. Owners work behind the counter daily to ensure quality food and service.  You will find you'll come back time and again."}
{"text":"Please see my glowing of this restaurant on 4/13/2013.   So I am on the Eastside for a meeting and in the mood for a good lunch. This place has good food.   I walk to the counter, order a shwarma pita and a coke to go. Pay my $9.27 and throw the change into the tip jar. I am told to sit on the to go bench and wait for order. I thought, odd, 3/4 empty restaurant and I have to crowd onto the bench. O well, no biggie. Wait for my order handed the sandwich and I change my mind. Sit down at one of 15 empty tables to eat and the snotty cashier barks at me across the room that next time if I am going to stay I have to order it to stay. I said pardon me, why does it matter, she responds, those are our rules. I state, there will not be a next time. I then place my uneaten sandwich and coke on the counter and walk. One of the managers catches my eye, waves me over. I ask him if I am welcome to eat in his restaurant.   He states that they have rules because of the liquor board. I am stunned by his illogical statement. I was not drinking alcohol, so what does the liquor board have to do with my pita and coke. He offers nothing. I say, ok I understand, turn and leave. Walk across the parking lot to Jimmy Johns to order another lunch (far inferior in quality) stand and wait. Then the snotty cashier shows up and tries to give me ten dollars. I say I do not want the money, she argues. I ask her why she is harassing me. She continues to argue with me. I tell her to leave me alone. Bizarre.   A little bit of feedback for the owners.   1. You can not get in trouble with anyone if you are not breaking the law. It is not against the law to eat food out of to go containers in restaurants.   2. The reason your dining room was not packed at noon is because of your lame service.   3. I will never return even though I really dig your food."}
{"text":"I love this place.  We have been coming here since it opened, and we really appreciate the healthy, yummy, authentic food. The service is always prompt, efficient and friendly. The only reason I hesitate to leave a review is that I don't want to make it more crowded when I am here. Highly recommend without reservation."}
{"text":"Food is good and the portions are excellent! The staff is less than enthusiastic but efficient and courteous. Prices are a little high but the quality (and portions) are proportional to what you pay. I would recommend this as a great everyday lunch spot if you are trying to eat healthy."}
{"text":"Small \"school cafeteria\" friendly atmosphere, yet there is a familiar home-cooking taste that blends well with the relative fast service, good blend of spices, acceptable table wines, family friendly, and yes! Affordable prices! Recommended!"}
{"text":"I am addicted to their chicken salad!!! Great place to eat!! I come here everyday for lunch!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Owner is a really nice guy and staff is always helpful! Food is soooo delicious! Best bang for your buck! So much variety and many choices to choose from. I'm definitely making this a weekly spot..."}
{"text":"This inexpensive gem is my favorite restaurant in the East Valley. There's a sign above the counter announcing that the food is \"Fresh Healthy Tasty\" and it truly is. The kitchen isn't hidden away; you can see the chefs preparing your food. They work really quickly, even when the place is packed at lunch.  The service from the cashiers and servers is always friendly and fast.  I've never had a bad meal here. I especially love their Greek salad, the gyro meat, and the Greek fries. They changed the recipe for their baba ganoush--it tastes to me like it has a bit of hummus in it--and I don't like it as well as whatever it used to be, but my friends insist it's just as good.   The dining space is just a big square, but it's clean and full of (east-facing and therefore not blinding) sunlight, so it always feels pleasant to linger over a meal here with a friend if you come when it's slower."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this little Greek place after our regular (Daphne's Cafe) closed up.  The food here is better than most places and is served in a cozy atmosphere.  Service is quick and the people who work there are very pleasant.  The food, specially the hummus and gyros are incredible.  They must make their own hummus, it is creamier and not as dry as many other places serve it.  Salads are very good here too.  Last time I had a gyro pita sandwich (large enough for two), Greek fries (AWESOME!) and a great side salad.  Yummm, all washed down with a diet coke."}
{"text":"I Read the reviews and they were true to form. No complaints. Everything was so tasty. If i lived closer I would eat here at least once maybe twice a week."}
{"text":"Arrived 25 minutes before closing and they said only carry out. Disappointed so I left."}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich here is extremely good! The toasted  bread is fresh and tastes homemade. The chicken is marinated and the vegetables on the sandwich are very fresh. The cheese is melted and so delicious!  The people that work here are very nice and give great customer service and the prices are fair.   The restaurant is clean and a great little spot if you are in the neighborhood.   I have also tried the gyros here which are excellent and the fries have a spice that is really good too. (Not hot spice, just flavorful)  Give this place a try and let me know how it goes!"}
{"text":"Service was slow.  We didn't personally know the staff, so we didn't get much attention.  The table who knew the staff didn't wait for anything.  Being one of two tables, I would have thought that the team could have handled a total of 4 people equally.  Food was blah.  It was more American than greek.  Don't get your hopes up for traditional greek food."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome place for Gyros in Mesa! I ordered a Gyro, Greek salad, and Greek fries to pick up. They made my meal fresh and quick. Within a few minutes I was on my way to my parents house to share my new neighborhood find. The gyro was fantastic, and their pita bread was soft and warm. It tasted home made too. My parents loved it and we will be coming back here more often since it is conveniently located right around the corner."}
{"text":"Great Greek food. I have had the chicken Greek salad that is really good and flavorful. Hummus is good especially the new jalepeno and cilantro. Good food"}
{"text":"So good! Greek salad is amazing. Service is top notch, environment is relaxing. What a great little spot! My kids love it!!!"}
{"text":"One thing to note, the guy at the register most of the time IS FRIENDLY. He just doesn't smile a lot. He's still very nice, just doesn't smile until you start talking to Him. First time I went in it did seem like maybe he was scowling a little bit but I think that's just his face. (A lot of reviews mention the guy looking a little bit mean so I thought I'd say this)  Still recommend chicken gyro."}
{"text":"Went here once for lunch, and had a gyros sandwich.  I will try my luck elsewhere, as I found it too greasy.....will go to Bellagio next time."}
{"text":"A bit hard to find tucked behind Starbucks. Fresh food made to order. The lamb kebabs were made just right, large fresh Greek salad, and homemade hummus made the grade! Pida bread could have been a bit fresher. Friendly folk. Can't wait to try the homemade pistachio baklava!"}
{"text":"When you come here you are getting okay Greek food with okay portions at a holy cannoli price. I prefer gyro place in Mesa off of power for large filling portions at a reasonable price"}
{"text":"We adore their gyros!  We've tried gyros several places but always end up saying Cafe Mix's are better.  Whenever my kids have a half day at school, they want to come here for lunch.  Even the fries are amazing.  Their hummus is delicious too.  Can't wait to try the baba ghanoush.  The owners are friendly and they remembered me even though I don't go in all the time.  The first time I went in for lunch after my youngest started kindergarten, they asked where my little one was!  People who pay attention like that are people who care about customers.  But back to the gyros:  high quality meat sliced onto piping hot FRESH pita bread, topped with FRESH tomatoes, lettuce, onions, and tzatziki that is clearly made in store with good quality yogurt.  I lick the wrapper to get all that tzatziki sauce!  Don't judge me.  I hope this place lasts a long time and never changes their standards."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely great.  We ordered a shwarma and an Italian chicken salad with beer and wine.    Service was excellent, although a bit too eager at times.  It's a matter of taste. I give them points for attentiveness.  Prices were very reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food.  Everything was cooked to order and very fresh.  Tomatoes, lettuce, olives, chicken, pita, EVERYTHING was absolutely lovely and on par with Pita Jungle, which is quite a bar to meet.  We were very pleased with our experience, and we will be back as regulars."}
{"text":"Buyer beware....The food is terrible. The customer service is poor. The owners are unprofessional and argued with me about returning the food. The chicken kabob entree all tasted the same, rice was soaked in olive oil and butter, the hummus tasted like baby food and chicken was boiled meat. The chicken kabob salad was dry and tasted like it came from bottom of the barrel. The best thing about the salad was the salad it's self. I strongly suggest trying the Gyro House off of Val Vista and Southern. The food is 150% better!"}
{"text":"Tasty Gyro! Can't believe we have never been to this place before now...we live right down the road. The prices are great, the service is quick and the food is great. We have only had the gyros with greek fries but they are delish!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and sevice!  My food is always good.  You get generous portions and the prices are decent. I wis they had one farther east of this location, closer to where I live!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The Greek Salad is amazing, and huge! I eat the whole thing but stuffed after doing so! I eat here at least once a week :)"}
{"text":"We goto Cafe Mix at least once a week. Food is really good, especially salads and Chicken Gyro. Service is fast. Food always fresh. The owner is always there and staff is great."}
