{"text":"I have to agree with other reviewers about the ambiance.  The room is way too big, and the decorations are plain and sparse.  BUT.  The moussaka and the eggplant Parmesan we enjoyed was somewhere between \"way good\" and excellent.  

The moussaka had a creamy, custard topping which complemented the eggplant and lamb fillings as well as the spices.  I can honestly say I would go back and enjoy it again and again -- and try other dishes.  The servings were generous and the price was very fair.  The eggplant was similarly generous and delicious.  The dinner salads were generous portions, and glasses of wine were 5 bucks a glass.  The waitstaff were friendly and competent, but not overly unctuous like so many chain restaurants are. 

If you like to support local independent restaurateurs, Mike's qualfies.   If you are looking for a fine dining experience with fancy tasteful decor and a wine list, this is not your place.  But if you are looking for real food, nicely prepared and at a reasonable price, give Mike's a try."}
{"text":"How can anyone give this place four stars? The restaurant was empty on a Sunday at 9:30 which should have been our cue to leave. After being seated, it took over 10 minutes to get our coffee. When I asked for menus we were told it was a buffet only and they were working on finishing it.  We waited another 20 minutes for the buffet to be ready.  My son thought the food was passable; fried potatoes were good as was the bacon (the slices that weren't burnt). My omelet was not cooked through, and the mushrooms were questionable so I couldn't eat the middle, only the edges. 
The place is dark, dreary & dirty. The carpet is filthy. Bottom line: Don't waste your money. 
New to AZ, I'll try other places in Surprise but I'll happily drive to Fountain Hills to go to Flapjacks where they serve great food in a very clean location."}
{"text":"We have followed Mike over the years and love his food.   This restaurant itself is not the best atmosphere, but the times we have been there, the staff is awesome and the food delicious.   The staff is warm, friendly and helpful.   We have enjoyed all of the food that we have eaten there and are delighted that Mike has  restaurant for us to eat at. It is a 30 minute trek into town and we will happily make it."}
{"text":"This place sucks!  I should know I get all of the crap the paying customers don't eat - except the stupid 'gourmet cookies' (more on them later).
I've been here for a while and many nights a week - they pile up all the 'leftovers' and feed me the crap in the morning.  Shish taouk, shish ka ba ba bouey, shish ka yabba dabba do - shishka everything.... what about some shishka alpo?  I know this place sucks because there is always tons of food 'left over' - if it was so good you clowns wouldn't leave it for me!  Her I like - A LOT - him? Not so much - he was responsible for me getting my nuts cut off!
Great location, excellent service - bla bla bla.  About the 'deserts':  Here's the menu - every freaking night: Cookies.  Not the amazing dried liver and corn that I get - these fools eat cookies with TONS OF CHOCOLATE - idiots - don't you know chocolate can kill you! I'm done.  If you need me - I'll be in the corner liking my balls - oh wait - that's right I don't have any!"}
{"text":"The cheese bread loaf was delicious but unfortunately the chicken in my entree was raw. They gave us 20% off of our meal and cheese cake that i find to be the most disgusting of all desserts but they did try."}
{"text":"Best food in the West valley! Try the Stromboli. It's incredibly good. Yes, the decor is hokey, but what mom and pop shop isn't. It's the food that you go for and it is so fresh you will be overwhelmed. We decided to try breakfast there today. Mike did not disappoint. It was buffet style, all you can eat and everything was made with care. Cinnamon buns tasted just out of the oven, breakfast lasagna and sausage in marinara were fantastic. Mike made the eggs himself to order at an omlett station and the fresh fruit was perfectly ripe. It was such a stroke of luck when my fiance and I stumbled on this place looking to get away from the chains that dominate Surprise. If you can overlook a dated dining area, you will be treated to the best food of its kind, possibly in the entire state of Arizona. Support this local icon and please... Enjoy."}
{"text":"When we saw that Mike's was coming back the first thing my son said was: do you think they will still have the saganaki?

We went in had a seat in what was the former location of Archie's Deli, and at first were put off from the fact that there were no improvements made to the interior. It still looked like Archie's (old) Deli. (Their \"new\" location is terrific, btw) This was unfortunate, I found the lack of creating ambiance a bit off putting. It looked dingy. The only change I could note was the painting of the dropped ceiling tiles, and that was poorly done. However, we liked his food in the past, so we had a seat in the booth section and ordered. We were there for lunch so we ordered from the lunch menu. I had the falafel pita with Greek salad, my son had the gyro pita with Greek fries. The falafel was wonderful - clearly homemade, fresh and perfectly seasoned on the inside, fried crisply on the outside but still moist on the inside. The salad was DELISH! An awesome Greek salad with super fresh feta and a great homemade dressing. My son's gyro pita was also delicious, the meat was tender and seemed to have an extra dash of spice on them. Yummy! The fries were good, but slightly underdone. We also ordered the saganaki, which was flamb√©-d table side with an OPA! It was very good, but I think the cheese seized up a bit from having been cooked too long, it was burnt on the bottom. It made the cheese less \"oozy\" and hard to spread on the pita. Despite that, it was still pretty darn tasty!

Lunch prices were reasonable. The server was quite nice.

I hope Mike's has a long run, things have been bleak without having Greek food that we like in Surprise. (We still mourn losing My Greek Corner!) I just hope he finds himself in the position to do an overhaul in that location, his food deserves a beautiful setting in which to shine."}
{"text":"I wanted to enjoy this new Greek & Italian restaurant; however, a few failures in our first experience sort of soured it for me.  Here's a summary of our party of 3's February visit:

1. the decor is tacky and doesn't speak to either cuisine being served.

2. It wasn't busy at all when we arrived at 4:35pm (four tables with patrons) but we had to wait for 15min. before someone came over to take our drink order. ??? And it was by the man who greeted and sat us originally, our service was pretty spot on thanks to him even though he wasn't planning to be our server but for some reason the woman working our section just couldn't handle additional tables.  My only complaint was that he never offered to refill our water and by the end of our 1.5hrs there, I had run out of water and poured some of my co-diner's water into my glass.  Never leave a table without asking if anything else is needed or with your hands empty because our empty plates sat too long, as well.

3. for the appetizer round:  the saganaki was fun and tasty but may have had too much brandy or was on fire a bit too long because part of the cheese was burned black.  The mozzarella cheese sticks were over-fried as two had no cheese inside them but rather all over the platter.  The Greek side salad was not traditional as it had lettuce and mushrooms which we of course picked off but what a waste of food when you're expecting a \"Greek salad.\"  The lemon chicken soup was delicious and a must try!

4. the bathroom was...the worst experience I've ever had in a public bathroom because the sewer smell coming from the floor drain was so strong that I had to physically keep my appetizers down while in there.  There's no way the owner/employees aren't smelling this, too. IMMEDIATELY DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS! Utterly disgusting.

5. there is no kids menu. Surprise is a family town.  Italy and Greece are countries that cater to their children - I know, firsthand, having traveled to both repeatedly over the past 20yrs. and just recently to Rome and Athens last April.  it's a family restaurant, add some kid friendly options and kid friendly portions on the already four page menu. Small choices like mini pizza, fruit, chicken tenders, broccoli, fries or tater tots, etc.

6. an older stocky gentleman came by the table to welcome us and kept on moving. If this was the owner, he should have taken the time to at least ask how everything was. By the time I said hello back, he was on to the next table.

7. our main entrees: yeeros and pasta carbonara came out hot and huge!  I'd recommend the yeeros as the meat was tender, juicy and seemed fresh.  The carbonara dish was good with plenty of bacon and very creamy.  The garlic bread basket was a nice touch and came in handy with the alfredo sauce.  I couldn't taste the garlic on it but I love garlic and would have loved it smothered in it.

8. the dessert came out quick which was great!  It's sad that the baklava was served warm and falling apart. I was told because it was fresh, made that day that this is why it's flat with all the ingredients falling away from one another. It was a hot, gooey mess.  That's not the baklava anywhere in the US or in Greece I've ever had.  

I want this restaurant to succeed because Surprise needs a good, solid go-to Mediterranean restaurant for the masses to flock to and maybe even be transported overseas for a meal (if done correctly). :) In order for that to happen, Mike's needs to iron its wrinkles and fast!  I don't know if I'd give it another chance...but if I do, it will be in a couple months just to give this crew some time to fix the operation a bit because they definitely need improvement.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Not very busy but welcoming for lunch at 2:30 on a Thursday. Chopped Italian Salad was not what I expected -- not really chopped at all -- but who cares, because the flavors were AMAZING!  The fresh basil was so fresh and flavorful, a delightful note in each bite I was lucky enough to find it.  Cucumbers, romaine, tomato, fresh mozzarella, red onion, artichoke hearts and a zing of flavor from pepperoni and crumbled Gorgonzola. The vinaigrette was so full of herbs & spices and I drizzled it on the crusty garlic bread I layered with mozzarella and romaine for a crunchy, tasty mouthful.  I was in heaven.  

My husband had gyros and Greek salad which I tasted and loved but my obsession with my enormous fresh salad distracted me from remembering many details other than the kalamata olive and bite of sundried tomato. Hubs loved it! 

Server was very friendly and efficient. Quick to refill our waters and never hovering."}
{"text":"We have always had amazing food at Mikes. We have been faithful patrons for years and now in their new location, we will be visiting frequently!!! Love the food, love the people! Life is too short for bad food!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a disappointment. 
I brought my son and we agreed that this should be on Kitchen Nightmares. 
We arrived at 5:30 and didn't leave until 7 because they were so disorganized. They weren't idle. They were too busy to pay attention to us.

We ordered an appetizer, spanokopita. The sauce on top reminded me of a thickened lemon chicken soup. Our meals eventually arrived. I had seafood and pasta. My son got a chicken with mushroom dish. The shrimp and scallops were so small I assume they were canned. My son enjoyed his meal. We ordered a tiramisu to go. Later I dug in and found it to be consistently mediocre.

$58 plus tip is what this less than stellar experience cost me. I will not be returning. It's hard to strike out with appetizer, meal, dessert AND service but they did."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Mike's Kitchen for the first time this evening, and the food was absolutely amazing. The waitstaff was exceptionally friendly, professional, and attentive. We will definitely be returning. The owner Mike stopped by our table twice to check to make sure that everything was satisfactory. We had absolutely no issue with the decor. Because like somebody else said you're not eating the decor. They even gave us a complimentary cannoli for dessert.

All I can say is please don't let the negative reviews  stop you from trying this amazing restaurant.

LOVED IT!!!!!"}
{"text":"Over-priced, overly greasy, and just overall not good. Yelp you steered me wrong! Makes me so sad, we were so hopeful for a good Greek place by us."}
{"text":"Stopped by for fish fry and two traditional Greek dishes. Delicious. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome Sunday brunch...their name actually detered me for months but so happy I checked them out..great food at great price."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Mike's since he reopened in his new location.  As always. his food was excellent and the service was both good and friendly.  Mike has always served some of the best food in the valley.  We will come back often"}
{"text":"I visited Mike's Kitchen today and it was fantastic. The service was terrific! Someone in our party wanted eggplant and the server recommended eggplant Parmesan, which wasn't on the menu. I tasted and it was really great! All of the food was great. I shared a Greek salad that came with two types of dressing. We got the Italian and Greek dressings and both were equally loaded with flavor! The salad was packed with cucumbers, feta cheese, garbanzo beans, kalamata olives and more. We also split a 10\" chicken kalamata pizza which was delicious! Super tasty. Very unique and for a place that I don't think specializes in pizza, the crust could compete with any pizza place! The decor was nice enough - not the fanciest of restaurants, but you could tell they put some effort into it. It was a nice homey feel. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Mike was out of Gyros at 6 pm the night of the Awards. What? The place had two people dining.  The grape leaves had a terrible spoiled sauce on top of them.  The prices are high. The place is dirty.  I will not return."}
{"text":"Corn beef hash or chicken fried steak is the best call @ Mike's
Never have had a bad meal here 
Better be hungry as the portions are huge"}
{"text":"Mike's Kitchen is a must stop place in Montreal....As other reviewers have mentioned, its not so much the food, but the Chef.   I find it fascinating that they give a waffle fry basket upon seating, instead of bread at the beginning.  And I can't quite put my finger on the skunky older that is wafting through the air....It brings back memories but I just can't identify the scent.  Whatever that smell is it certainly stimulates the appetite. Finally, the fact that you are forced to purchase a dozen cookies before being allowed to depart is awkward but overall a pretty smart business move.  Rumor has it they will be accepting bit-coin soon, so I guess thats a plus."}
{"text":"My wife and I have followed the owner Mike for 24 years now and I am picky about my Italian food. You can taste the quality ingredients he uses and he truly loves to cook for his guests. He comes to visit you at your table to make sure you are happy. If there's something you want that's not on the menu and he has the ingredients, he will make it for you.The staff is very friendly and make you feel at home. If you like Italian and Greek food, this is the place. We drive over 20 miles to eat here because \"Life Is Too Short To Eat Bad Food\". 

Support you local businesses not the chain stores."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  I had the yeero platter with the lemon soup and it was very good.  My husband had the mushroom ravioli, the name of the dish escapes me right now, and the Greek side salad.  He said it was very good as well.   The only reason I am taking off a star is because they did not have a kids menu.  We ordered some French fries for her, and gave her a bit of our meals instead.  We will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Yup. Food was very good and lots of it. My sister had a  baby clam small Pizza and it was huge but very very good. Great home made crust. Will want to try again."}
{"text":"The food was good (I had the Athenian Yeeros - yes, that's how they spell it on the menu, my wife had the chicken pita,  and the kids had a cheese pizza). Wait staff was friendly, and the Baklava for dessert was very tasty. The only reason that I refuse to give 5 stars is because the whole time we were there (I shit you not)the same song played over...and over...and over. I mean Zorba's Dance has a tendency to make anyone tap their toes, but not when it's on perpetual repeat."}
{"text":"went in for lunch, (edit: went on 12/30/16) and ordered spanakopita...holy cow, it was excellent. i ordered a 10\" \"paesano\" pizza, with eggplant, and it was also excellent. the spinach pie mostly filled me up, so i only ate one piece of pizza, but that meant delicious leftovers for dinner! can't wait to go back and try the other dishes!! wait staff very friendly, and Mike came by to ask how everything was, and then stopped by the front to say bye. so nice!"}
{"text":"It's a very new place, so the service is great. It's Greek and Italian. I put the wrong one first. I had possibly the best moussaka I have ever had in a restaurant. The top layer of be hames sauce was thick and creamy. I don't know how to describe the rest except to say yum! And the baklava is to die for. It's not overwhelmed with honey and has lots of tiny chopped nuts all covered in a crispy pastry. It's just perfect. Marsha S."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is lacking but the food is pretty good. The booth for two is a little cramped. I had the \"Yeeros Platter.\" Why it is spelled that way instead of Gyros, I don't know. I enjoyed the Greek salad which preceded it, plenty of feta cheese and Greek olives, and homemade dressing. The meat was tender,the tzatziki sauce was good, and the roasted potatoes were nicely golden and tasted good. The pita was placed underneath the meat which made it a little soggy. The green beans side I could have done without. Adding marinara on top of the green beans did not compliment the Greek flavors of the meal. 

Compliments to the chef, service was also very good, but need to invest in interior design."}
{"text":"Most recent visit... Since my folks like this place so much, we went again.  We ordered 3 gyros platters.  This time there was little meat, cut into small chunks and all topped with jalapenos.  HONESTLY.... who puts jalapenos on a gyros ???  Needless to say, we didn't like it.  Service was good, along with appetizers and soup.  But true greek salads need more olives (more than 2) and a side of feta cheese."}
{"text":"MIKE IS BACK! OPA!

The West Side has a NEW \"GEM\" in Town!

Mike is a well known Chef in this area and is well known for his Greek and Italian Cuisine. 

This restaurant prepares well made food. Sauces and many meats prepared in house. The front of the menu says they are a Bakery too so possibly some of the breads might be prepared in house too.

I've been to his last restaurant many times and this new restaurant offers a bigger more varied  menu, wait staff, roomy comfortable booths.

I came in for lunch and ordered the Salmon Souvlaki Pita. The pita came with my choice of Greek Fries or Greek Salad so I went with Salad. Out comes a big fresh salad and soon after my pita arrives. The pita bread seemed like it was made to order as it was so fresh and hot and the filling was tasty. My husband had the house made sausage with peppers and onions. The sandwich was baked with bubbly mozzarella cheese. 

We were checked on several times by our server and by Mike.

We will stop in for dinner next time as I remember the Myconos Chicken was pretty darn tasty.

Portions are large and pricing is reasonable.

They serve breakfast (8am), lunch and dinner 7 days a week.

Give Mike's a try when your in the area!


Very Slight update.
Very surprised that many yelper's are making an issue about the atmosphere. People are making it sound terrible and that really isn't the truth. Just look at the pictures and see for yourself. Mike's is not high end and has a slight retro feel and is a whole lot better than many little dirty ethnic dumps you see on dirty dining.  Now THAT IS THE TRUTH!"}
{"text":"This was a nice Surprise in Surprise, Arizona. We stopped in for lunch and tried the Mussels and Greek salad. It was so good I knew I needed to revisit this place. 
We returned  in the evening for a take-out. We ordered one Lamb Shank. This was so delicious. It was served over fettuccine with a beautiful red sauce. It was enough for two people easily. I live in Utah but I will dream about returning."}
{"text":"We visited here tonight for the first time. We enjoyed our food overall but there were a few things that I think may need some work. The atmosphere is not quite there yet. Their fluorescent lights are red which gives the whole place a weird feel. Almost like we were on Mars! Also the bar is constantly flashing different colors which is odd in a dining room. It would be in place if it were a night club, but I don't think they are going for the night club feel. They need some help with decor also, it felt very big and empty. The waitress was very nice. She was very good at refilling drinks. We got salads and Italian wedding soup before our meal. I liked that the salads were more than just lettuce like you get at other places. The dressing was very good. My son enjoyed the soup. Our food came out in a timely manner and all of our main courses were good, but nothing to rave about. The price is a little high I think considering the atmosphere. Also my daughter's silverware did not appear to be clean. I may go back and give it another try in a few months. Maybe they will have worked out some of the kinks."}
{"text":"We ordered a gyro and chicken pita, very disappointed in both.  It didn't seem very fresh and it seemed far from a true Mediterranean dish, because we've had great gyros & pitas from different restaurants.  The take out service was mediocre & odd with one waitress telling another how she can't wait to go on vacation, counting down the minutes & wishing she didn't have to come back.  As another co-worker came in, on her day off to get food looking pretty disheveled.  Joined in on the personal convo with the other 2 gals at the front as I sit there waiting for my take out order.  The disheveled gal went on & on about how her car is a piece of crap & she needs new tires, one of the gals working told her that her spouse could look at her car & that she should check out rent-a-tire and she can make payments.  I could've really gone without the personal little problems & convo being conducted at the front as I wait for my food, time & place for that.  Then to get my order & the food be unsatisfactory just made my experience worse."}
{"text":"We held our Surprise Rotary Club Executive meeting (party of 12) at Mike's.  They were every accommodating and the service was stellar.  Even though they were in the midst of their dinner rush, they set our group up in a quiet area and treated us like royalty.  Everyone in our club ordered different meals and they were all highly satisfied.  The food arrived quickly and hot.  I ordered the \"potato boats\"appetizer and they were simply fantastic.  I highly recommend you stop into their new location and try out their extensive menu.  They will be establishing a \"Happy Hour\" menu for their bar and it looks exciting."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this hidden gem for nearly 4 years now, I make it my goal to check the menu here at least once a week. Without fail the chef here is always cooking up something new and amazing. From his pastas to his burgers the man has a repertoire longer than any other chef i know. Your average chef has his speciality something he does so well he is famous world wide for it. Mike here, he's a simple chef making just about anything. Never stopping to try and becomes the worlds best, but happier having a wide variety of comfort foods so good you'd marry into the family just to eat more! Easily a 5-star location for any one seeking great food, or cookies, the man loves his cookies. I mean they are the best cookies I've ever eaten (if you can call that much butter and chocolate with some dough a 'cookie'). It's like he's trying to give them away, some times at home I open my freezer and find a few waiting for me, no idea who he does it. Here's to many more meals, many more creations, and god knows MANY more cookies (whether I want it or not!)

I give this place a \"C\". and \"C\" is for coming back soon."}
{"text":"5 stars for the delicious food.  Large menu, and  large portions.  1 star atmosphere, but Grade A proudly displayed. Denise was our server, and she also deserves 5 stars. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Why the 2 stars?

Feel like a lot of the other reviewers nailed it when saying the decor was very off putting. It honestly looks like a dive. Don't get me wrong, Ive enjoyed many dive restaurants. However this one just seemed unkept and dreary. 

The staff needs a few training lessons I would say. The woman taking our to-go order walked away without saying anything to me after I told her my order. Left us standing there money in hand for 10 minutes before coming back and telling me my total. Common courtesy would be to let me know she would be back in just a moment to finish the order. 

The food wasn't bad. I feel it was a bit pricey, but was ok. Honestly not somewhere I would recommend nor visit again. Sad because of the reviews I had high hopes. I feel either these people had a stroke of luck on their visit or simply friends of the staff. 


I don't enjoy leaving negative reviews, but I know I rely on others reviews when trying someplace new."}
{"text":"We had the hot Italian beef which was delicious and the Greek salad on the side was wonderful.  The chicken pita was ok, just too much going on in 1 sandwich for us.  Good service and menu. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I had the opportunity to enjoy a date night so we decided to try Mike's Kitchen. We really enjoy eating at different kinds of restaurants and haven't had Greek in awhile. When we came in, everyone was friendly and the lighting was nice. There were quite a few people eating and we were asked where we wanted to sit. We chose a booth. I ordered the mousaka and my husband ordered a veal dish with artichokes and capers. We both thought our food was fantastic! We also had a flaming cheese appetizer that was so much fun to have prepared at our table. The yummy baklava rounded out a delicious night out. The place is fairly new so the atmosphere is basic but pleasant. Food and customer service are most important in my book. We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Sad. 
I don't want to give a bad review, but I have to be honest and I feel I was mislead by all the reviews I read on this place. 

First impression I wanted to run back out and so did my husband, but given the rave reviews I thought we should stick it out. 

The \"decor\" (if you could call it that) was cold, unwelcoming and very confusing. The front booths had no color and checkerboard tablecloths like a diner/pizza joint, while the back was mostly tables with green walls and tons of junk on display. The back wall had a large ladder leaning against a door which lead me to hope they were remodeling the new location. The ceiling \"tiles\" had paint missing and weird pieces of red fabric over the lights along with red glass pendant lights. The front counter (bakery type display) was enormous but completely empty. Hmmm

So we sat down and the girl brought us menus. The tables around us were dirt with dirty dishes/food and remained that way for our meal. The menu seemed promising with lots of choices Athenian, Greek, Italian  (perhaps too many?). 

I started with lemon chicken soup ($3.45) that tasted canned (the chicken had the consistency of Campbell's chicken noodle soup). We asked the server for his recommendation. He said he likes the \"chicken pita\"...so, I asked which one?  He didn't know. What is in it? He did not know...
OK...
So we went with the Kalamata ($8.95) as that was what I was leaning towards. We also ordered the $10.95 Gyro Burger, medium...sounds interesting. 

The salad was \"ok\", and the chicken pita tasted \"spongy like microwaved from frozen\" according to my husband and the tzatziki sauce was watery and bland. The burger had a \"square\" corners on it and was chewy like only frozen beef can feel. It was also a distinct \"well done\", however thank goodness it wasn't undercooked as my hubby & I were sick the rest of the day.  

At the end of our meal a very sweaty dirty man with long greasy hair (Mike?) came out to ask how everything was...really?  

Servers were nice and attentive (1 star), but we won't be going back. Very disappointed as I LOVE Greek food and we really need some variety around here."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their Greek food. Excellent balance of seasonings. I had the chicken pita with Greek salad. The dressing for the salad and tzatziki sauce were homemade by the chef. Fresh ingredients. It has become my favorite restaurant. Staff is very friendly.   The chef is from Greece. I think the decor is \"charming\". Lovely Mediterranean music in the background"}
{"text":"OMGOODNESS!! If I could give 1 million stars I would! Service was great, but the food..the food was amazing!! Normally Italian food makes me feel stuffed/sluggish && I should eat again for another month! However Mike's food was great the taste was on point! I had the salmon special w/ fettuccine Alfredo and I've gotta say the salmon was made perfectly wasn't over cooked or under cooked it pretty much just melted in my mouth! And that sauce, I wish I could bottle it up and eat it everyday! It seriously reminded me of my childhood when my dad would spend hours in the kitchen cooking a perfect meal, mike's kitchen thank you for an amazing dinner, service and for bringing back Amazing memories! We will def be back!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING!!! Impeccable food and great service. We have been there several times and the waitress remembered small details of our likes. That goes a long way in customer service. The food is incredible and made with quality ingredients. Most importantly it is done with pride. I would rather give my business to the common fellow any day before chain restaurants. You will not find quality, taste, presentation and pride in a chain restaurant and these qualities are clearly delivered in their cuisine. Great portions, plan on left overs!!!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 10 stop in for dinner. The waitstaff was great. We had different foods for most. Everyone said they had a very good meal. I had the lasagna and it was moist and way more than enough. Fresh bread on the table for all. Drinks were fine. No beer on tap. But, plenty of choices. 
We all felt that a return visit is in the future."}
{"text":"Only opened a month ago in this new location. Wouldn't have known it was there, except for yelp.
Unimpressive sign, hardly any cars or customers. We were still dubious as we entered and saw a mostly empty place, but noticed the large pan of Baklava fresh on the counter! Looked fantastic! 
We were seated, and looked over the extensive menu, I had Dolmathes, husband had reuben (said it was some of the best corned beef he'd ever tasted, Dad had a porcetta panini which was also reported to be very good. If we actually lived in the area, we would return to try many more of the menu items. 
I will say that the interior decor leaves much to be desired, so I hope their intention is to work on that in the future as they settle in."}
{"text":"Tried this place after finding it on Yelp. Food was great! Great portions and great quality. I'll definitely come back again. I got the Greek omelette and my sister got the Siciliano skillet."}
{"text":"The first time they opened, my husband and I walked into this restaurant and was turned off by the way it looked inside... so we left. 

The floors are filthy dirty. The carpet is EXTREMELY dirty. It's really gross. And the decor and atmosphere need A LOT of work. It's quite confusing and everything clashes. I'm not sure why this wasn't addressed BEFORE they opened the restaurant to the public... because it is what WE see as the first impression... and first impressions matter A WHOLE LOT!!

However, after months of eating the same restaurants around the area over and over again.... we decided to 'suck it up' and give this place a chance... and I'm glad we did! 

Food 4.5/5.
The food is actually REALLY good. I tried the \"Yeero plate\" with Italian wedding soup. My husband got the Greek Fries. Complimentary garlic bread. The garlic bread was really good and we both liked our dish a lot. The gyro meet is really tender and reminds me a lot like the gyro I had in New York (very yummy!). I also got the Baklava dessert, but haven't tried it yet since I took it to go and I'm still too full to eat it. 

I will be coming back here again. Although, I really hope the owner does a full makeover of the restaurant. It has a lot of potential... but it's not going to be as successful as it can be if this is not addressed. Also, the name of the restaurant is lacking."}
{"text":"Had a good lunch here. First time in and ordered the pita chicken and lemon soup.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great new location on the north side of Bell.  Dave our server was attentive, there at every turn. Becky raved on the Greek salad, my Caesar was fresh, and flavorful.  Becky ordered the calzone, having to take half home it was so big.  I had the Involtini di Polo alla Vsldostana  stuffed chicken breast with mozzarella, ricotta,  fontina, feta, fresh spinach, sun dried tomatoes, topped with Marsalla wine mushroom sauce.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"The food is good. The music is nice. There's a wide selection of Greek and Italian favorites. The Baklava is spectacular.

Of note from our meal was the Gyro platter, Moussaka and the Calzone. Kid size spaghetti and meatball was a hit too."}
{"text":"We have had a few meals here and it's the best food in town.  Their breakfast meals are too good, try them!  They are just getting started with breakfast so they aren't busy yet."}
{"text":"We used to go to Mikes when it was next door many years ago, food was excellent, was sorry to see it go, but now it's back, we will return with hungry tummies."}
{"text":"After Mike's Rigatoni Bistro on Bell and 83rd Ave closed, my family and I were devastated. This place has the same menu, the same food and is just DELICIOUS! The Mussels and Greek Isles pizza is fantastic! If you want fabulous Greek and Italian food, this is your place! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Horrible brunch!! They weren't set up when we arrived, half the table was empty. Omelet station had one burner that kept on going out, bacon was blubbery, sausage was undercooked. Potatoes were old. Croissants were dried up. Wish we had gone to Golden Corral. Don't waste your money here!!!"}
{"text":"We never got the chance to visit the old location, but heard from Mike's past...food would be excellent.  And it definitely was!  Would loved to had a glass of wine with our dinner, but was not an option.  Hopefully he will get a license soon...we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So went there with a party of 3, got seated instantly. Menu was kind of weird, in that the menus were different length of pages than each other but the same amount of pages had writing on them, what i mean is one menu had a blank last page, another had a blank page in the middle and a blank page on the back (not that, that is a deal breaker) but get the same number of pages for your menu, be consistent. The place was filthy dirty I'm not sure why we stayed (must have been all the great reviews). I got the Gyro Greek Salad and it was delicious (be careful the olives have pits and the menu says so) I think it was $10.95, GF got the Grilled Chicken Caeser Salad and it was REALLY good, Buddy got the fish special, which consisted of 3 large pieces of deep fried (something) COD, Greek fries (he said it was basically fries with salt and pepper) coleslaw which was dry (he likes a lot of dressing on his slaw) and a desert cannoli which he gave to me and that was very good (except the Hershey syrup that they put on the plate below the cannoli (I was expecting something different for the chocolate sauce) His fish came out it was only luke warm. I am going to try to upload 2 photos I took, one is of a vent in the ceiling where I wiped away some of the dust to give you contrast, the other is of the floor, what's may look like shadows is really the dirty carpet. Booth back rests were disgustingly dirty, this whole place should get a pro cleaning crew in on a Monday (when they are closed) and do a top down cleaning. Also like another reviewer said, they have a huge deli/display case sitting empty. And a interesting thing, hopefully the owner will read all the reviews and make some changes but to the owner when you post a message on social media (Facebook) promoting your brunch buffet you may wish to go back and revisit the post and answer questions. The owner posted on a Facebook page and multiple people attempted to engage in the post inquiring about the hours and costs and it was crickets...(no response, this was months ago when I heard about this place and honestly if there would have been a response I would have went sooner to this business. Also where is your menu online?? Not that it is a requirement but that alone almost deterred us from coming in tonight."}
{"text":"An odd restaurant, getting service was a challenge, ordering a glass of wine took intervention by the owner.  Doubt we go back"}
{"text":"As good or better than I remembered from when the restaurant was near arrowhead. Perfect for gluten free. Mike said he would work with me and make what I want. I had gyros,meat melts in your mouth.yum. my husband had fish fry 3 huge pieces of Alaska cod large portion of off and coleslaw and a cannoli all for 9.99. Wonderful. Looking forward to coming again"}
{"text":"Mike's Kitchen for breakfast this morning -EXCELLENT!! Not the usual breakfast fare, but some very interesting and unusual choices. But, don't get too excited. Mike told us that they were discontinuing breakfast completely due to the poor turnout. Instead they will have Sunday Brunch Buffet starting on January 9 from 10 AM to 3 PM. An omelet station where you choose all of the ingredients and Mike will cook it in front of you. Also a huge buffet with many, many options. $10.95 for adults and $5.00 for kids. (note - coupons not accepted for brunch and no \"to go\" boxes). Can't wait to give it a try."}
