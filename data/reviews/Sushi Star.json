{"text":"Food is great but for the price should be more generous. Ordered extra mushrooms in hibachi meal which cost more and got less then when I didn't order extra."}
{"text":"Have been there only once and the staff was very pleasant. However, their sushi was not the best. It mainly consisted of rice which is not what sushi contains. I would probably not come here again."}
{"text":"This place is very good.  Fast and inexpensive.  I love getting the Hibachi Steak and LOVE the Shrimp Sauce.  I usually get take out as the place is really small and not too comfy for dining in, but the food travels well in take out containers."}
{"text":"I used to come here in high school and the sushi was great. I had a craving for sushi yesterday and was in the area. The service was still great, and the price was reasonable, but the sushi was pretty subpar.   Good place in a pinch, but I would rather spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Our second stop today. Once again no sushi bar. Well, kinda but not one to sit at. Got to talk with the chef and was very friendly. We tried three different rolls and all were average, something about the flavors. We would feel bad about giving 2 stars so i guess 3 is ok. 2.5 stars from us, theres better places in the area..."}
{"text":"don't expect anything over the top here. the sushi is pretty good for the price when you want something quick and easy. it's definitely not the best I've ever had by any means but I always come here when I want 'cheap' sushi lol. just your typical Japanese takeout spot. their hibachi chicken is good too, just sometimes a little too salty."}
{"text":"The noodles are really cheap pasta and I swear there was a ketchup concoction on the volcano roll. Neither that nor the spicy tuna had anything other then tuna inside. The upside? They serve cheap bottled beer. I still won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Good sushi at a great price. Half price rolls are a plus and they often have coupons on double take deals. Sushi is fresh and never fishy. I only eat raw sushi and have been pleased with the quality, quantity and their flexibility to accommodate my taste. No, it's no Eez but you aren't paying Eez prices either. Overall - great lunch & take out sushi."}
{"text":"Rolls are HUGE!! You only need one. And the owner is ALWAYS there. She really cares. I remember when they first opened. This place was a hot mess with their service but the food has always been on point. And they have really found their place with the service. The energy is flowing right in this place now. :)"}
{"text":"Sorry guys, but this place is bad.  Atmosphere, shocking.  Random music, even had a song dropping the F bomb...  Real classy.  Food, well below average.  Mushy rice and tasteless.  Sorry guys.."}
{"text":"A hidden place with great sushi and hibachi!! The Jeff roll is my favorite! There is always specials on sushi as well!"}
{"text":"Visited this new restaurant after checking out Yelp. Was definitely not disappointed. Portions were huge and we made it for the grand opening buy one get one roll free. Flavors and freshness were all great. Will definitely be back soon. Only wished the seating areas were bigger to allow more room because this place will get busy :-)"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Don't expect great food but it is passable for what it is. Potentially a quick  lunch spot if they worked a little faster. Both times their was confusion with their ordering system. Also I saw one of the workers go from the touchpad register to working with food and NOT washing his hands!"}
{"text":"I love this place ! The sushi and hibachi taste delicious! The service is great!! Quick service and very friendly!!"}
{"text":"HELP! Im addicted to their teriyaki sauce! I am a frequent customer here and its a layed back environment. They got TV, beer in a casual setting which is to my liking. Food overall is very good, chicken is at times dry and times very moist. Other than that I recommend them."}
{"text":"Eez has always been my favorite sushi in Huntersville but my son begged for sushi for lunch and we thought we would try this place.  I really had low expectations but it was really good.  Very fresh and the staff was really nice."}
{"text":"Best place in town! I eat here twice a week. Friendly staff, delicious sushi/hibachi, and great pricing. I have 3 friends who are now hooked also."}
{"text":"Good sushi for the price. Always seems to be half off. Nothing fancy just a sushi express. When I need a quick sushi fix I always go here. Could be more friendly though and have been known to leave things out of to go orders."}
{"text":"Not bad, but go on \"2-for-1\" roll night.  They are very similar to Yoshi's (oddly enough, they are in the previous Yoshi's location).  Quality of the sushi is good, however ordering and presentation is a little lacking.    My family of five ordered four rolls plus a noodle dish.  Even though the noodles had the option of chicken or steak, you could not get them without any meat at all.  The four sushi rolls all arrived on the same plate which made it a little difficult to share."}
{"text":"Price is what pushed this review from a 4 to a 5.  On Wednesday and Friday their sushi rolls are buy one get one free.  This is a great place to get some sushi on the go.  The inside is similar to a Chinese place - nothing fancy mostly kitchen.  Staff is very friendly and extremely fast considering how many people they serve every night.  We will return!"}
{"text":"Every Wednesday and Friday is buy one get one free sushi. Every other day is buy one get one half off sushi. For that reason alone, you really can't beat Sushi Star. Rolls range from $5-$13, most being around $8 or so. Sushi is good and they have a decent variety of rolls. Clearly this is not going to be up to par with some of the nicer sushi places like Eez, but for a quick inexpensive dinner you really cannot beat it. Two rolls for under $13 is amazing. I make it a point to go every week for BOGO Sushi and would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a quick sushi fix."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! They are fast and their sushi is top grade! Wednesdays and Fridays are buy 1, get 1 roll free! Also, they don't just add a bunch of extra rice to a little bit of the good stuff. Other days are buy 1, get the 2nd roll half off! Will continue to eat here!"}
{"text":"Wanted this to be my \"go to\" sushi takeout place. Not any more. The service here is terrible.  Went in tonight and waited for my food for 15 minutes. After waiting, the young boy that was working the register asked me what I had ordered. When I asked if my food was being made, he said, \"no\". There was no one eating in the store at this time. Not a soul. If they can't serve me in an empty restaurant...no thanks. Got my refund and left."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Nothing really stood out.  I've been many other places that have better technique in making sushi.  If you want a quick bite then this place is fine, but keep you expectations in check."}
{"text":"Stopped by Sushi Star last night...second visit.  Had a to-go order of sushi, noodles and gyoza.  The shrimp tempura is a family favorite and it was great!   The chicken crunchy roll was a Tuesday special...and the combination of chicken, cream cheese deep fried with crunchies was very good.  Everybody loved it.  The gyoza....dumplings filled with chicken and veggies was also very very good.  The stir fried noodles [almost angel hair thin...but a little thicker], had vegetables and chicken...simply amazing!  I must go back again...later this week!"}
{"text":"Short story: Not bad for a strip-mall sushi place. The gyoza were good and the Rainbow roll was pretty tasty, too.  Long story: Don't come here looking for atmosphere. It's a fast-food-type sushi place with limited seating (though they do have outdoor seating, too) and a fairly uninspired menu (mostly Americanized everything-but-the-kitchen-sink rolls). Drinks are limited to soft drinks and a few beer selections (no hot green tea? Really?), but service was pretty quick and they do offer good discounts. The sushi rolls they offer really aren't my thing and they don't offer sashimi at all, so I'll probably go to a more traditional sushi restaurant next time.  Price for gyoza appetizer, Rainbow roll, and soft drink came out to about $15, including tip."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous reviews..customer service is very lack luster!! No friendliness whatsoever...not for a single patron. I ordered the lunch special with no mushrooms, no carrots...received a plate full of mushrooms & was asked if I wanted them to take out the mushrooms!!! I can do that myself sir..thanks but no thanks!!! I don't think I'll be coming back to this place ever!! The prices are good for a lunch spot...hence the 2 stars."}
{"text":"Okay sushi. Rolls fell apart and the crunchy crunchy rolls were mostly cream cheese and rice on the inside. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Very good sushi, very nice people- would give 5 stars if they diced up the tuna w the spicy mayo in the spicy tuna roll (just my preference) and if they offered brown rice for rolls (my husband's preference).  Very fresh, great variety and love that they cut rolls into 8 pieces instead of 6 without having to ask like I do at other sushi places!"}
{"text":"Good sushi..Excellent service/friendly..Great BOGO sushi on Wednesday's..Have dined in once, and taken out twice..Will return, recommended.."}
{"text":"Best sushi place ive come across to date, absolutely love it ! Not only is the price the lowest ever, its quality surpasses it. Their menu is amazing, they have something for everyone. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays are Buy One Get One Free and every other day is Buy One Get One Half Off. If your a big sushi lover i would recommend this 100% over any other place. Try and compare it to other sushi places, and sushi star will show its worth it hands down."}
{"text":"Please never go to Sushi Star. They cheat their customers and harass their own staff.   Today when I went to pick up my to-go order, the management was screaming at the customers and their staff. I saw a manager shove a staff member and yell at her to be faster!  When I picked up my food, there was clumps of random food covering my to-go box. At the register, I handed over cash, but the casher never told me how much the bill was and he never gave me a receipt. When he gave me my change back, I realized that he had over-charged me. When I asked him about it, he denied it and refused to fix it. He was rude, constantly interrupting me and telling me that I was wrong.   Then, a man got out of line and starting screaming that the line was taking so long. He came into my personal space and starting yelling that I was taking too long. Management and staff had plenty of time to resolve the conflict. They could have apologized for over-charging me, they could have apologized to the man for taking so long to ring him up, and they could have asked him calm down and stop threatening other customers. But they did nothing. When I got home, I put my order  in the trash because I was so disgusted with what had happened.   Please never go there. Please don't support their practices of cheating customers out of money and abusing their staff members."}
{"text":"Caution:  They are not 4-5 for quality of sushi but for the restaurant they are set out to be.  This is clearly not a fine dinging experience.  If you want that then go to Sushi at the Lake, Eez, Coral.  Sushi Star offers inexpensive mediocre quality rolls.  I have never gotten sick or had something that tasted bad, in fact, rolls like the Alina roll are actually pretty darn good.  Hibachi is farrrrrr better than Yoshi, you'd have to be nuts to think otherwise, just look at the difference in quality of chicken.   Service here is nice but terrible.  It takes a long time (way longer than they say at times) to get an order.  Also, as many have said, CHECK YOUR BAGGGGS!  All in all, for a quick sushi/hibachi experience, this place is pretty darn good for that.  If you want something nicer that will also cost more, then go someplace else."}
{"text":"They had a deal going for buy one get one free sushi rolls. Seemed like a great deal until we got the rolls and they were ALLLLLLL rice. We pretty much paid $24 for rice.  The establishment didn't seem terribly clean and the staff that we interacted with wasn't very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I have to echo the sentiments of other Yelpers that Sushi Star is a good, quick serve style sushi experience. You order off the menu board above the counter (or you can ask for a menu to read while standing in the lobby awkwardly), then a few minutes later a tray of food is brought to whichever table you have parked yourself at. My rolls, the Dale Jr. & New York, New York, were good - not overly fishy or chewy - though not outstanding. The portions were generous, with each roll having 8 pieces and one of my rolls being so sizable that each piece became a few bites. The gyoza we ordered were of similar quality, though a more normal size.  I would definitely recommend Sushi Star to someone looking for an in and out, not too picky sushi experience on a budget. If you want ambiance, elaborate service, or are willing to pay for really outstanding quality, you may be disappointed."}
{"text":"Every Wednesday and Friday is buy one roll get one free - amazing deal! First time here today i ordered the shrimp tempura roll which had been my favorite sushi roll but i also tried the crispy chicken roll and it is definitely my new favorite! Customer service was excellent, staff was friendly and i didn't have to wait very long at all - but they do offer a call ahead option to order which would make it 10 times more convenient!! They've got a loyal customer in me :)"}
{"text":"Eat here way too often on Wednesday's and Friday's, they're starting to know my name! BOGO sushi, can't beat it ANYWHERE. The rolls are always fresh, service is always awesome. I order ahead about 15 minutes and grab my food on my lunch break. If I ever get fired from my job here in Huntersville, you bet your butt I'll still be driving here from Cornelius!"}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant. I love their sushi, especially the B1G1 Free specials on Wednesdays. however, I went in one Wednesday evening recently and saw they had a new employee. This person was not friendly at all. She was chomping on either food or a piece of gum when I entered and paid for my food. She didn't greet me, no how are you doing... Honestly I'm not sure she said two words to me. I've never had an issue with the other associates. They remember my name, my order, how I always like to have extra sauce, etc.   The food is still great! I just like great service too :)"}
{"text":"I've gotten take out from here a few times. It's not the BEST I have ever had, but it is way more delicious than grocery store sushi and the but one get one free nights are great! I like the Steven Tyler roll, yum!"}
{"text":"With a name like 'Sushi Star' you would think that pretty good sushi awaits you.......but au contraire, I was not impressed with the mushy rice rolls served here.  I've had better....much better.....so don't be fooled by the name.  They are new to the area and the chef was very nice and helpful so they may get better with time, but I will have to steer clear for now."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for lunch and we couldn't believe it was the same owners as the huntersville location. Sushi star has the BEST sushi in charlotte hands down!! I'm beyond excited that's there's a closer location to where I live!  If you go and order your food comes out very quickly and it's made to order. Which I love!! We went during their buy one get one free and we went crazy! Lol we ordered the Jenny roll, Tall Paul roll, huntersville roll, and the North Carolina roll. The last two are my favorites! They really do fill you up and for the price it's even better. We got our food pretty fast and they were the sweetest people. They make sure you enjoyed your food and want to make your experience the best which it was! I loved it! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I used to drive 30mins away from school just to eat here. I get the habachi chicken and steak with extra broccoli and 3 random sushi rolls with no cream cheese and BAM im in Heaven. The reason why Its not 5 stars is because i had one bad experience where the tuna was chewy and the cucumber was not fresh at all. Other than that one bad day, its a good place to eat sushi and roll out in less than an hour. I will continue to come back."}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood and have been going for years. It's a great little local place, the sushi is always fresh, the lady who owns the place is always smiling and happy to see you. If you're looking for something fancy, look elsewhere - they aren't trying to reinvent the wheel but you'll get good sushi that's affordable."}
{"text":"Work across the street, and I go here practically everyday, namely for their healthy options. If you tell the people you are trying to lose weight, or get healthy they will always steer you what to get, and the caloric intake of each piece. They will even doctor to it to a way that you may like.  I love the place, and the people. The wait is not too long unlike at New Zealand near work. Always a fan, and always will be"}
{"text":"So I used to come here a lot to take advantage of the great buy o e get offer. I stopped coming about 6 months ago because after waiting almost an hour on a call in order I decided to leave. I gave it another shot today as it was early and I hoped they wouldn't be busy. I called in my order at 332 and it was not ready until 352. The staff is pretty much apathetic about the whole situation. The woman ahead of me said she'd ordered left and come back and still her order wasn't ready."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed! Very friendly staff and very accommodating to my gluten allergy. Hibachi lunch special is a great price and the portions are just right. When I'm craving something, its always Sushi Star!"}
{"text":"Called the order in and was told 10-15 minutes.  The food was ready when we got there.  We ordered the teriyaki chicken with fried rice & vegetables to go.  The chicken didn't look that appealing but had great flavor. The carrots are sweet, the broccoli was not overcooked like you will find at some asian restaurants.  The shrimp sauce is delicious! We live very close so I am sure we will be ordering take out regularly! A great addition to Matthews."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi. Friendly staff. Feels great to encourage small businesses."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I was not a sushi person until we came here got the one with bacon in it and that changed my life!! #inlovewithsushi"}
{"text":"For take out Sushi it doesn't get better than this. I have tried all the Sushi in the Gilead road area and by far not only is this damm good its extremely affordable. I eat sushi on average 4 to 6 times a month and I love this little place. The coolest thing is the family loves their hibachi so its a win win. I do love sashimi and they don't do anything but rolls but that's OK The atmosphere is. OK in a quick food sort of way but I usually bring it home anyway"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced lunch specials with some hibachi grill options as well. After getting one of those Yelp notifications saying \"We've found a great lunch spot near you\" I decided to give this restaurant a go. You can definitely find good deals here if you're with the 1/2 off sushi rolls a couple of times a week.  Rolled in on a Thursday for lunch and surprised to say that 3 of the 4 employees were wearing... camouflage T-shirts... okay, that's not quite what I expected at a sushi restaurant, but that's fine! The menu is very simple with starters, grilled options, and sushi categories laid out well.  Went with hibachi chicken and a spicy tuna roll. While I waited on my food I started to take in the details of this place and it leaves a bit to be desired. My table had what I hope was dried soda left on it. I was seated by a tinted window that separates the kitchen from the dining area and I could see residual 'grime' on my side of the glass. You start to look around the rest of the restaurant and realize they need a bit of TLC. Some tables had low-riding bar style seats with no back, some had backs with no cushion, some were showing their wear. A few tables circular and most small and square, up against the wall. Some restaurants can make this work with a 'rustic' feel from reclaimed woods and artistic touches to make the character pop. This was more reminiscent of a surplus furniture auction. By no means am I saying this is a no-no.. I just wouldn't highlight the fact with the place being dirty...  ...anyhow, food comes out and I gotta admit, the Hibachi chicken express lunch was pretty good! Rice was perfect and had a toasted, wholesome flavor. You get a nice portion of chicken that's seasoned well with plenty of hibachi sauce and it's just enough for lunch on its own. Solid A+ on the grill-works.  The sushi is a different story. At least what I got today: The spicy tuna roll. I can't be for certain, but the 'spicy' in my spicy tuna roll is what I believe to be a ketchup-based chili sauce. It tasted just like a spicy ketchup on top of an orange sauce. A rather petite roll as well, it just didn't do the tuna justice, as the tuna had a great, firm texture and fresh flavor. The last 4 pieces I actually just pulled the tuna out and used my chop sticks and a ginger slice to 'brush' some soy onto the tuna slices. The spicy sauce just ruined the roll for me, not because it was spicy, but because of the ketchup-esque topping...  With a great grilled entree at the right price point, I'll probably be back. I think next time I'll get it to go, though."}
{"text":"As with most of the reviews, I would agree.  Sushi Star is a GREAT choice for sushi when you are on a budget or a time crunch.  The menu is large and they have a lot to select from.  The hibachi is filling, comes in large potions and really really good.  The sushi quality is good, but don't expect it to stack up against a place like Eez or Cowfish. They are consistent with their quality and it is a great quick fix without the sometimes outrageous sushi price.  Just be warned, if you go during their buy one get one free sushi roll on Wednesdays or Fridays, be prepared to wait.  It can take up to and hour to get sushi (hibachi 10-15 minutes).  Your best bet is to call your order in, but definitely check your bags.  It can get very busy in there and sometimes keeping the takeout orders straight can be a challenge.  Overall, Sushi Star is a great neighborhood restaurant that has limitless choices, fast service (except on Wed/Fri), budget friendly selections and is good!"}
{"text":"This place is on my way home and starving after a long day at work, decided to give this a try. Love the way they did the decor with the little wardrobe with the Chinese/Japanese cups and foods. I wanted it for take out as it was snowing but they have tons of seats and very cosy and comfortable.   The lady is so nice. It's a family owned business and she's so sweet. I asked her for her recommendations as it's my first time here. She asked me some few questions if I prefer seafood or chicken? I finally chose the Vancouver Maki and it was delicious. It's really affordable for the quality and amount of sushi you get. I had 8 mini rolls and they were filling. The man makes the sushi right on the spot and asked if I wanted wasabi.  It was my first time here, not my last for sure. I'd keep going back for new plates and definitely would recommend it to all as they're amazing!    - :)"}
{"text":"I admit I was skeptical at first. This place is located in a random shopping strip and my expectations were low. But the sushi is surprisingly good! Is this a high end place? No. Would I pick it for date night? No. There's no bar. Just a handful of basic beer options). But it's a great option when you want a quick, convenient, economical option that still tastes good. And it's buy one sushi get one free on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"The $4.95 lunch express special is probably one of the best deals in the area. Even though you can only get chicken as your choice of protein, the portion is pretty big. I tried calling ahead but the line was busy and once I finally got someone to answer the phone I was placed on hold to hear everyone in the restaurant ordering their food. By the time I arrived at the restaurant I was still on hold, so I was not happy that I had to wait for my food.  Inside the restaurant is fair small but enough tables to sit down and eat if you wanted. The employees were friendly and my food did not take too long to come out after ordering. I was impressed with the variety of sushi rolls that were available. I will probably come back and try a roll especially on the bogo sushi roll day.  For a cheap, quick lunch meal this place is pretty good for the area."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times since it opened. Good sushi, reasonable prices, friendly staff. Also, I never get tired of trying new types of sushi, and this place has a lot of options! I recommend the Alina and Spider rolls... good stuff!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to drop a quick note on Sushi Star.  I went there for lunch and had the buy one, get one free!  The rolls were outstanding, huge, fresh and very very very excellent!!!   A special treat that they have is squeezy bottles of spicy mayo, whabam!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now since it's opening. While for the most part, the sushi is a massive bust at this restaurant, I must say that I am thoroughly impressed with one thing and one thing ONLY.  The Hibachi Lunch Special.  For less than $5 from opening to 2:30 pm, you can order Hibachi chicken with fried rice and sweet carrots.  This meal is more than filling and genuinely a great deal. For its price, the meal is more than impressive and I can say I've returned several times now for this item.  HOWEVER, everything else this restaurant has to offer just misses the mark. The sushi just isn't good. I heard from friends before I went that the sushi is subpar and after trying several rolls myself, I completely agree with that statement.  Overall, the sushi is no good, but the Hibachi lunch special is. The service is also exceptional (the cook came and gladly informed me about what goes best with what menu item and I appreciated that). If you want sushi,  go across the street to Shiki :)"}
{"text":"Update. Well like a lot of restaurants, they start off strong and give a great product and then they start backing away from what they had. I feel that that's what is happening here. My two rolls today we're a total disappointment. I believe to keep them looking big they don't bother to really roll them. One I could pick up even with my fingers without it falling apart. The other was covered in mayo and cucumbers diced. Not sure if there was fillings in the roll. All I could taste was the mayo. No longer the value for what you get."}
{"text":"Just tried sushi star for the first time and I am not impressed with the presentation of the sushi and the lack of fish and filling.  The flavor is off too and I would say that Harris teeter sushi is even better than this. The sushi was not even cut into appropriate sized slices. There was little to no avocado and I paid $13 for the roll, which is extremely overpriced for what I am getting. I ordered teriyaki steak and got teriyaki chicken instead and the chicken is over cooked and not that flavorful. I probably will never order from here again. Gross!"}
{"text":"Thought we were in for a good experience at first with the guy behind the counter recommending his favorites.  We ordered based off of his advice and waited for our to go food while others ate around us. While waiting a group that was eating complained about not getting 2 of the 4 roles they ordered. The server argued with them that they did but we didn't really think anything of it until we got home. We ordered 2 hibachi chickens with rice and 2 sushi roles. We got the hibachi but got 3 sushi roles that were not even close to what we ordered. The girl even came up and asked us what we had ordered before she gave our food to us. I know, we should have made sure before we left but we were starving. Also, how hard is it to give people their correct order after confirming with them what they ordered. The guy helping us decide also told my husband that the hibachi with no rice was the same as hibachi with rice but more expensive. We thanked him for the heads up but after reading other reviews we found out that the hibachi no rice comes with zucchini, broccoli, mushrooms, and carrots where as ours with rice came with carrots and mushrooms only. I have some restaurant experience and have used it to base my assumptions on what went wrong. I think that the front of house workers did not know the menu which could have prevented all of the mistakes made. They were young workers but I'm not going to let that be their excuse for bad service. With better management in place this place could be good."}
{"text":"Guaranteed the Best Hibachi & Sushi in the LKN Huntersville Region! Truly great owners & awesome quick quality food everytime!"}
{"text":"By far the best sushi I have ever eaten. Better than Yoshi's, better than Ezz Fusion."}
{"text":"Just tried Sushi Star for lunch.  I ordered the spicy tuna roll and the Fall Season roll which had  shrimp tempura, avocado, cream cheese, bacon and topped with shredded crab. I enjoyed the Fall Season roll. It was very spicy which I love and had a nice smoky bacon flavor to it. I was disappointed with the spicy tuna, which is always my favorite. They topped it with two types of sauces and one had a sweeter taste to it and I didn't like it.  The interior of the restaurant is small but cute. There were a few people in there enjoying lunch, but to me, it seems more like a takeout place. Everyone was friendly and the wait for my order was pretty minimal.  They had a buy one get one free sushi special for their grand opening so you might want to check it out while that is going on.  I will definitely go here again and try something different."}
{"text":"I just had lunch at Sushi Star in Rosedale/Huntersville. Excellent sushi! It is incredibly fresh and tasty.  They cook their hot dishes on the spot.  It's never sitting in a warmer tray.  Their food is made fresh, while you wait, and you can watch them make it.   I can't wait to try their tempura.   Jenny, Sunny, Edwin and the gang do a great job. They run specials all of the time. Great food."}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice, The food is great and on Wednesdays and Fridays, they have BOGO for sushi. definitely recommend and will come again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  They have 50% off sushi on Wednesdays and Saturdays, I believe, and while I haven't tried the hibachi, it looked fresh and tasty.  Nice selection of rolls; the only reason I gave them four stars instead of five was their lack of non-roll sushi options.  It's definitely not high-end sushi, but it's good and affordable and I'd go back often."}
{"text":"Good sushi, but 15-20 minutes isn't a time they should be quoting customers when tonight I had to wait for 45 after being told 15-20 minutes. This is maybe the 5th time this has happened to me"}
{"text":"I finally decided to try this place.  I skipped the sushi spot I like down the road for somewhere with less waiting time (I had hoped anyway).  This restaurant had a big meal and I just wanted something good but not expensive.  Not many people were dining in, just three patrons and everyone else was getting takeout.  I thought the restroom was in the far back but it's up front to the side so I looked silly walking way back there for nothing when I came in.   I got the spicy tuna roll and pewki? Roll.  The pewki roll had a sweet sauce on top and like another Yelper,  we weren't fond of it.  The sushi rolls were big but not much taste.    I thinking this place was the fast food of sushi.  Maybe I'll try something else but I'll probably stick with the sushi spot I like most."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. They got our order wrong which was caught at the time of pickup. However, instead of correcting the mistake, they argued with us that we said something we did not. I understand that mistakes and misunderstandings happen. However, if it is obvious that you have not prepared what we ordered, don't you think you should offer to correct the mistake?  I live and work within a couple miles of here and used to frequent this place because the food was decent, but won't be going back now."}
{"text":"Good sushi and great deals. Buy one get one sushi rolls on Wednesday and Friday all day. Daily lunch special $5 for hibachi or teriyaki chicken. To go service can be frustrating during lunch hours especially on Wednesday and Friday. Call in early and double check your order."}
{"text":"Not going back again.  Sushi was o.k., I asked for shrimp tempura and when I got home I found that they gave me the shrimp tempura in a sushi roll - make sure you give them clear instructions on what you want.  Does not compare to the sushi I get at Rockland shopping center or at Atami sushi on Cote des Neiges."}
{"text":"For an \"express type\" sushi joint it's not bad.  Stopped here once before and figured it was good enough to try again.  The sushi roll menu is pretty big - with many of the rolls labeled with unfamiliar names. So you need to read the ingredients if you don't frequent the place.  They also serve up a standard, express type of hibachi/teriyaki meal for cheap.  They seem to offer a buy-one-get-one at half price deal all the time. Might explain the higher prices for express sushi.  It's not the best place you've been, but if you find yourself in this strip mall, it could be much worse."}
{"text":"This is definitely quick sushi. I dropped in on Friday after 1pm and it wasn't very busy. Their deal of the day was BOGO rolls. I ordered the New York, New York and added the Olivia as my free roll. Neither rolls featured raw seafood. I was being cautious because they aren't the cleanest establishment. In fact, when I walked up to the register I noticed that the woman who was running the register looked sweaty and she coughed into her shirt as she greeted me. I proceeded to order in spite of my first impressions. I got my order to go and it was ready within 10 minutes. The rolls were okay. They weren't the worse I've ever had but I don't think I'll be back because I'm germaphobic."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place after all the good reviews, however, I was left totally unimpressed.  Call me old fashioned, but to me customer service needs to be first.  The woman taking my order was not interested and texting while taking my order:/  My spicy tuna left me disappointed.  Simply bobbing siracha on top isn't considered a high point to me.  It should be mixed to a blended consistency.  Nope.  The table lay out is awkward....there really isn't any place for a single diner, so ypu are forced to sit at a 4 person table.  Despite attractive deals, this may only be a one hit wonder for me."}
{"text":"Much better places nearby. Went in for the first time tonight and it was empty. Stood around for about a minute before someone came out from the back room. Ordered a Teriyaki meal. I live in the neighborhood so I frequent the restaurants in the area. My best advice, go to one of the other two established japanese/sushi places -- the prices are comparable but the food is way better.  NOTE: I wrote this review in 2011. I've transferred the review from my other Yelp account I'm closing. Hope this place has improved since then. :)"}
{"text":"Tall Paul roll 8/10. Not exactly good for you, but LEGIT.  Side of mushrooms. 100% bout it.  Seaweed salad. Samesies.   Would repeat.  Seating and layout are snug."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!! That other sushi place - you know the one in Birkdale - can take a hike. Sushi Star is THE STAR. First time here after reading all of the great reviews and folks were not lying! Hubby and I went on a Saturday and took advantage of the buy one get one half off sushi rolls (on Wednesday and Fridays they're buy one get one free!). They were DELICIOUS! We had the Steven Tyler, the Bosci, the Orlando and the Jeff Rolls. Large portions and SO fresh! We were stuffed! Four entrees and 2 drinks for $41 for 2 people - not bad! We had to take half home because of the generous portions. Friendly and prompt service were a bonus. We've found our new spot for sushi!"}
{"text":"Great place to get some inexpensive yet very tasty sushi. The buy one get one free sushi on Tuesdays and Fridays is the best. I always order the California rolls, two of them easily fills me up. I will definitely continue to come here from now on for sushi. Will have to try their hibachi dishes as well during lunch time."}
{"text":"This place is my go to when I'm craving sushi. Which is at least once a week. The service is amazing, the staff are friendly and inviting, and you just can't beat the prices. I always get the crab crunchy roll and it is to die for. Best sushi I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This place is good...not great (you get what you pay for)! super fast service!!  So if you are wanting hibachi for lunch and want it quick and cheap, GO HERE! We get to-go about once a month and it is always good! The staff is very nice too."}
{"text":"My family tried Sushi Star yesterday. Based on their reviews we didn't expect food like New Zealand Cafe down the street, but we didn't expect horrible food either.  We ordered from the hibachi menu and the sushi menu.  The chicken in the hibachi noodle was beyond dry and nearly flavorless.  It is loaded with mushrooms to the point that the noodles taste like mushrooms. This was not an issue for me as I love mushrooms, but it was our sons dish and he likes them but doesn't like them that much. We also tried 4 different sushi rolls and none of them were very good.  I have never seen such a small Rainbow Roll. It Rainbow Roll had the thinnest slivers of fish on the top. The rice was very dry and had no flavor. The cucumbers were rubber like and the avocado had lots of brown marks. My husband and I are sushi lovers and this is the first time EVER that we threw away sushi. The only positive I can say is the young girl at the front was very nice."}
{"text":"Not a good spot for Dine in! Our food came on styrofoam plates and freezing in the place. The appetizer(Chicken dumplings) came out after we almost ate half our dinner. I had sushi which was expensive for the quality of the rolls. Fish was tough..Expensive for what you get. Husband got hibachi noodles and it was just steak and very bland noodles we had to dump a ton of soy sauce just to eat it. For a very small appetizer, 2 rolls and a small hibachi noodles - no drinks at all!!! it was over $30. Will definitely be checking the other places nearby to get my sushi fix or taking the drive to Rusan's in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Was pleased after trying Sushi Star for the first time.  They have a huge menu of sushi roll options...they literally have a huge 8 foot tall menu by the register!   Right now they're running a special buy one roll get one free.  We tried the Wolfpack roll (good spicy) and the Rolling Stone.  Both were tasty!  We also shared a chicken teriyaki dinner.  Like any good Sushi restaurant, they had plenty of the coveted Yum Yum sauce.    I thought prices were very affordable (especially with the buy one, get one). There isn't a ton of seats in the restaurant, so takeout is probably ideal.  Staff was friendly and glad to give advice on options."}
{"text":"This place is great. We eat here quite often. I'm not big on Sushi but I like theirs! So glad to have them in the neighbor hood"}
{"text":"Tried two different kinds of rolls and both were good. They are bigger pieces than most places serve. Have half price sushi on Wed and Fri. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Love this place, don't go here for anything else but sushi though, Wednesday's and Fridays they have buy 1 get 1 free rolls and you can't beat that! Love their selection also!"}
{"text":"Let me first say I do not like sushi. My husband loves it though, and I do like hibachi so we tried Sushi Star.   The first time we went, I liked my hibachi chicken and that this place is very convenient. Restaurants tend to turn over in this strip so I was glad to see a new one in the area. I want a few to stick around. My husband wasn't as crazy about his order (sushi). It looked like a hot mess & he commented that part of the appeal for him is that sushi is so visually appealing. He wasn't  crazy about the taste either.  The second time I went and wow-what a difference. I called & ordered the \"no rice\" hibachi chicken + a side of rice at 7:15. They said it would be 15 minutes so I arrived, paid and waited and waited and waited. They apparently don't \"take\" the order until paid. I paid at 7:36  and didn't get my food until 8. Everyone waiting was so mad that I almost felt sorry for the people working there. There were 4 in line so it wasn't packed or anything.   OH the food! I took a bite of zucchini - it looked great. It felt & sounded like it had been coated in sand.  I've never experienced such a jarring sensation (because I don't eat  sand). I tried to eat a few more bites but gave up & threw it away. There are so many good, quick sushi and hibachi places in this area that there's no need for the long wait times for mediocre food at Sushi Star - This place won't last."}
{"text":"If you are looking for affordable but delicious sushi then make sure you check out this place. My favorite roll is the shrimp tempura.  One thing I was a little bummed about was their eel sauce. I am used to the dark and really thick sauce that most places serve but the one here is really light colored and runnier. It didn't have the rich, sweet taste that I am accustomed to. But I won't miss it too much as their rolls are so good as well as their prices.   The staff were very pleasant and helpful so that was nice as well.   The inside is not very fancy but I usually get take-out so it doesn't really bother me. It seems most other people do takeout as well.   Make sure you go on a Wednesday or Friday when they have buy one/get one free sushi rolls."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about all these other reviews...the sushi was bland and too large for comfortable consumption. The cucumbers were cut into huge sticks that were almost impossible to chew through. Sushi took 20 minutes to get. I might try their habachi later but the sushi was nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Oh so good sushi rolls!! The menu is yuuuge, I spend several minutes just deciding what to get , everything tastes real good!!!"}
{"text":"I forgot what day we came here, but we only came here because Noodletasia was closed during lunch and I couldn't wait so we swung by Sushi Star since it was just across the street.  We bought 3 rolls. Forgot what rolls they were, but my husband and I will probably never go there again. When I first opened our sushi box (placed an order-to-go) the sushi was so sloppy looking. It was not rolled tight and it was falling over. Took a bite of sushi from each roll and we both were done. Didn't touch it after that. I was hungry, but I wouldn't eat those sushi again.  If I had reviewed the same day, this review would had been more detailed but I completely forgot. My apology! So save your money and go to Noodletasia across the street. You'll be satisfy."}
{"text":"I was craving Sushi and Sushi Star is in a very convenient location right off of Gilead Rd in the Harris Teeter parking lot. Parking is a bit of an issue since there are only a few parallel parking spaces in front of Sushi Star but it wasn't difficult to park in the Harris Teeter lot and walk across the street.  I was initially attracted to Sushi Star because of the sign in the window that said \"$4.50 Hibachi - Lunch Specials\" and then immediately saw the sign for \"2 for 1 Sushi Rolls\" - SCORE! I was a bit skeptical until I saw the menu. Their sushi prices are really good! I don't know how often they have this deal, but I got a California Roll and a Spicy fried crab roll, each were $5 and with the 2-for-1, my total with a drink was just over $7!  The sushi was excellent. They don't make it until you order it and the fried roll was hot enough that I had to wait for it to cool, which was fine with me. I was very impressed with the quality of the food.  The staff was very friendly and I overheard the girl behind the counter tell a first-timer \"oh, you'll be back... don't worry\" and she was right. I made sure to let the staff know that I will definitely be a regular customer from now on."}
{"text":"Sushi star is a great addition to the hibachi world in this part of town , the teriyaki chicken and shrimp was delicious and shrimp sauce not really needed but it was nice to have .   I wish this location had online ordering like the Huntersville location, but I suppose that will come with time .  The portion size is perfect , not an abundance of rice (scratch that , just got teriyaki chicken again, um why soooooooooo much rice 11/14/16) with no stir fry, it's actually equal quantities all the way around . I was a little disappointed with my spicy tuna roll , it lacked flavor and creativity , I don't think I'll be coming here for the sushi, but the main dishes are a winner ."}
{"text":"We love Sushi Star for our family meal. We don't order Sushi, we eat the hibachi items with their delicious fried rice  Say hi to Jenny!"}
{"text":"I went there today, stood in line for 20 minutes and then left, there were three people in front of me when I cam in and they also walked out. They had two men doing everything , a girl serving and no one at the counter. No one acknowledge you coming in, no one said please wait we are backed up, nothing."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch after checking Yelp for sushi spots in the area. This place was doing a decent take out business, but there were also a few seats inside to dine-in. I ordered the spicy tuna roll and some other roll with tuna, avocado, cream cheese and cucumbers. Both of them were fresh and looked tasty. Honeslty, they were decent, and I think I should have looked at more of their crazier rolls than the ones I chose. I usually get spicy tuna everywhere and use that as my base for sushi spots, and this one wasn't anything special or warranting a trip back, but it was good. Same with the other roll, it was good, but had a lot of cream cheese in it. Definitely would come back to this spot when in the area, I would just try some different rolls next time."}
{"text":"Great rolls but so much rice on them! No spent half the time taking the rice off than eating.  Tuna and salmon could be a little fresher as well.  The best roll was the Hot Guy, no cream cheese...very spicy if you love spicy food.  A little overpriced but not bad for a quick lunch stop on weekdays or during the weekends."}
{"text":"You're kind of getting two reviews for the price of one.   I went to get a haircut next door, but it was a 20-minute wait. So, I hit up Sushi Star. Unfortunately, I didn't see the sign on the window for the Lunch Special when I walked in, which would have saved me $5 or so, and I wasn't informed about it when I ordered, but the girl behind the counter was friendly, and I should have paid more attention.  With all the Teriyaki and Hibachi, I wasn't sure what to get. Teriyaki Chicken? Teriyaki Steak? Hibachi Chicken? Hibachi Steak? With rice or noodles? I went with Teriyaki Chicken with noodles. It was good. It didn't blow my mind, but it was a solid performance. Also, sitting outside on a nice day was pretty cool (and pretty warm).   When I got my haircut, the lady giving me the haircut said she usually gets the Hibachi Chicken. When I asked if she liked it, she shrugged and said, \"It's okay.\"   I'll update this review after trying the Teriyaki Steak, Hibachi Chicken, and Hibachi Steak."}
{"text":"It's OK... Not to shabby! What's the best part of this sushi place? The B1G1F :) It's pretty plain, nothing too fancy.  I'd suggest grabbing it to go and eating it at home."}
{"text":"I eat here maybe 2 to 3 times a week, they have specials on sushi buy one get one free, on Mondays and Fridays.....one of my favorite sushi rolls \"STEVEN TYLER\"  They are creative with their rolls and honestly I am picky about sushi and this place it's just perfect for me! I'm always happy with the rolls I try...I can't say anything Abouchacra the other dishes because there is no point on trying anything else when you can eat sushi instead!  They have wifi and there is a big screen tv in the back (I got to watch a world cut socket game for lunch  a few weeks ago)"}
{"text":"I just ate at Sushi Star for lunch. I had the Hibachi Chicken with mushrooms and added on Zucchini and onions w/steamed rice. It was very tasty and the price was reasonable ($7.50). They have free drinks through the month of September. The sushi rolls seemed interesting and reasonably priced (a rainbow roll was $8, and the California roll was $5). I could see this giving the other fast casual Hibachi/sushi places nearby a run for their money."}
{"text":"Sushi is freshly made and they have Buy 1 Get 1 specials. Saturday was buy 1 get 1 free. Every other day is 1/2 off. But it's really good and filling. Nice location and very casual interior. Can't help but keep going for the quality and price."}
{"text":"So good. I love the chicken teriyaki and the crunchy Cali roll. Plus the cashier is super nice and pretty and has a kickass doctor who tattoo that's super legit."}
{"text":"Best lunch special in the area! $5 hibachi/teriyaki chicken special - EVERYDAY! Today, I lucked up for the BOGO sushi! #Winning  Great portions! Extremely good price! The space is a little small; however, can still work for lunch with co-workers, friends, and/or family. I wish there was one near my house because take-out is pretty quick, too.   The waiter is polite. He mentioned just starting with the Restaurant within the past few weeks so you won't have to worry about poor customer service. Luckily my fiancé works not too far away. He hates sushi, but loves hibachi - while I LOVE both. This will be our frequent lunch date spot. I'm winning all around!"}
{"text":"I got the spider roll and Alina roll. I didn't really like the spider roll that much so won't be getting that particular sushi anywhere anymore but I do like the Alina roll a lot. I got some other ones to go for my boyfriend but can't really remember which ones but I liked those also. The downside is that the sushis  aren't tight enough so some stuff may fall out but I don't really mind as long as it's good for the price and a definite bonus is that they have bogo free on Wednesdays and Fridays. The staff were also very friendly and quick with our order. It just sucks that this place isn't near my place I just happened to be on that side of town so my friend suggested we try sushi at this place"}
{"text":"I'm not super adventurous with sushi but everything I've tried here is great. The wasabi roll is super spicy (duh but my husband and I love wasabi and spicy food and we both had trouble with it. Still tasty though!) Cant beat buy one get one free on Wednesday and Friday!"}
{"text":"The sushi just keeps getting better!"}
{"text":"Hibachi is pretty good. I have yet to try the sushi yet. They have specials like buy one get on free sushi and $4.75 Chicken Teriyaki plates during lunch. The service can be rather slow at times even when there's not that many people waiting. It's hit or miss if you will get good or mediocre service. Always very clean when I go in. There's a good amount of tables to eat in but seems like most usually do takeout as do I. They have a wide variety of menu items and prices are reasonable as well as the portions."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best, way too much rice and tiny bits of fish. I suppose for the  boho price I shouldn't be surprised, but honestly grocery store sushi is better and faster."}
{"text":"We came in here on a Thursday and checked into yelp. Once I showed the owner the deal of half off rolls on Wednesday and Friday, he said he would honor that deal anyway since it was our first time! We got gyoza and 3 fancier rolls and it totaled about $20. We will definitely come back on Wednesdays or Fridays! It's not the cleanest place ever, but the fish tasted amazing for the price."}
{"text":"You can't beat bogo! However, I wish the rolls weren't all almost exactly alike! But you also don't change what works sometimes! Great prices for how much food you get! Friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"Great place especially when you are on a budget.  No definitely not Eez but still very good. I haven't tried anything else here but the Sushi but am planning on it."}
{"text":"Even though this place offers a lengthy list of sushi rolls it's my go-to spot for hibachi chicken. It's quick, cheap, and satisfying = perfect for lunch time take out. Most places charge more but all you're paying for is way too much rice. This place isn't Sukiyabashi Jiro so sushi snobs stay away. The rolls are reasonably priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Ever write a review of a restaurant from which you've never ordered food?  Neither have I.  Until now.  This review is based 90% on my oldest son and 10% on me eating food he has ordered.  These kind of places - sushi, hibachi, chinese seem to have sprung up in the LKN area like crazy. There are at least 6 I can name, all within reasonable driving distance from where we live.  With all these choices, my son (who has tried them all I think) has fallen into a clear favorite and, it's Sushi Star.  He loves this kind of food and he routinely bypasses closer places to get food from this joint.  Now for my 10%.  I've stolen quite a few bites from his take out boxes and feel like it's quality, good tasting grub."}
