{"text":"I'm a BIG fan! I'm almost tempted to go with five stars for this one but I'm gonna reserve that honour for the absolutely mind-blowing places I will someday encounter. 

This tiny little family run Vietnamese place is awesome. Everything I've had is good. Fast, friendly service all the time. 

Five colours rice is awesome. Steamed egg, fried egg, shrimp skewer, pork and shredded pork skin over broken rice. For someone like me who enjoys a variety of flavours in one dish this is great. The portion size is so big you could almost share it between two people. 

The vermicelli is also splendid. A perfect balance of noodles, fresh vegetables, pork, crispy springroll and shrimp if you desire with nice fresh mint and coriander. 

The various fruit shakes are fresh and tasty and they serve you complimentary hot tea while you wait. It's a nice touch.

I have had a couple of the soups and they are good too. I haven't tried the pho yet but I have heard great things.

This place is a two minute walk from my work and I am a proud regular. If only they were open on Tuesdays..."}
{"text":"this place is not concerned with modern decor.....they ARE however concerned with how their chicken noodle soup tastes!  It always makes me feel better!"}
{"text":"Frequently go here for a few different dishes but started with the pho. It was super good and the service is always lovely so upon returning decided to switch things up. 
The pho is excellent. The fresh rolls and spring rolls are tasty. Have had the pad thai which is a lil spicy which I love. You may not :) the beef and noodles are reaaallly delicious. Lotsa veggies and flavor. Cheap beer too!"}
{"text":"Here are my recommendations for this business
1) get a credit card machine
2) don't put lemon grass in your pad Thai
3) make sure to not make your to go order customers wait an hour
4) make sure the shrimp in your fresh rolls are FRESH so it doesn't taste weird
5) wipe down your tables with a clean cloth so they do not remain sticky 
6) give more napkins than the measly 3 pieces of  your cheap 1 ply 
7) thank you for at least being friendly
8) take items off your menu that you no longer have
9) don't skimp on your noodle portions on to go orders. SMH
10) GET A CREDIT CARD MACHINE"}
{"text":"Great little Vietnamese place to go to when you don't feel like cooking. Although I have had better Pho, this Pho is nothing to sneer at... very tasty. And the ladies added some nice 'authentic' stuff to it when asked (like pork blood). The grilled pork bahn mi is amazing as is the beer selection. It's hard to go there and not order way too much food as all of the appetizers are very tasty too. Well done!"}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food in the neighbourhood!  Friendly service, delicious spring rolls, excellent prices.  Just moved nearby and this is going to be my regular."}
{"text":"I finally discovered a good Vietnamese vegetarian noodle spot near Roncesvalles! I've walked by Pho Nho so many times, but never really thought much of it. It looks kind of random and ghetto from the outside, but it's quite lovely inside. There are two huge TVs, large spacious booths and wacky chandeliers. 

I was pleasantly surprised when we walked in for dinner. I was greeted by a very cheery server who quickly brought us a pot of tea and the menus (with a photo album of course). They have a huge menu with pho, vermicelli, curry, stirfrys and a whole section of vegetarian foods. I had the vegetarian noodle soup, which was probably the best I've ever had.  It was a HUGE bowl with lots of rice noodles, large pieces of bok choy, tofu, mushrooms, potato, carrot, etc. I barely made a dent and I was stuffed.

It definitely seems to be the area's best-kept secret. There was a mix of young and old patrons, and there were plenty of people coming and going for takeout orders. Music was good. Hockey was on the TV.  I will definitely return. My only complaint is that it took quite a long time for our food to come out - apparently due to a large takeout order.  It's also cash only, which is a bit annoying, but they do have their own bank machine onsite."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on a sunny sunday summer-still-here :) 

I wanted to test a good vietnamese Pho around the neighborhood and I found this restaurant thanks to the different reviews. 

The place is nice and clean. One \"bad\" surprise : I though I was in a club, with the crazy house techno sound... Relaaaax guys, it's sunday noon, not saturday night :) Please turn on some chilly relax music you want to listen, before fanstastic monday is coming :(

Anywho, those who already know Pho soup won't be surprise here. The soup taste good, I choose the classic \"rare beef\" soup. No choices for the size here, you only have one big bowl. The meat was excellent, no fatty ; the noodle were good, and the broth was very fresh without too much oil. 

I specially like how the food were exposed. One little bown for the Sriracha sauce and the Oyster sauce ; one plate for the mint and the soja beans. 

Don't forget to bring cash $ $ $ $ , there is a machine but you know how it works... they love to steal you some $ :) 

And by the way, if you're a \"Pho fan\" living in TO, maybe we could discover some others restaurant together !

{"text":"We love this place. It's so cheap for such delicious food. I've tried a dozen things on the menu and they are all fantastic. My favorites: Bun, sandwiches, pho, fresh rolls, coconut juice, the rice rolls dish (which every time we order she warns us against, but I love the coconut sauce). We've also had the mussels (tasty, but too much sauce), vietnamese curry, wide noodles, crab soup, vegetarian soup. The only dish I really want to try but haven't is the duck and bamboo - they seem to forever be out of it.

They are slow to bring the bill, so either don't be in a rush to get out or try to be more aggressive in trying to leave.

They also updated their menu since my first review, so now all the prices are up to date (there were discrepancies in previous menus...some including tax, some not).

In the summer, they bring a water bowl for my dog when sitting outside. And once I had to avoid certain foods for a while and the owner was happy to modify the dish for me."}
{"text":"This is the best Pho restaurant I've been too in the past 12 years.  The waitresses all spoke very good english and are super friendly.

The prices are normal prices you'd expect to pay in the GTA for Pho.  I've eaten the The vermicelli and rare beef pho numerous times and I'd recommend both of them.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place with a warm atmosphere. Service is always greeted with a smile. Banh mi is great and pho is amazing! Been here over a dozen times and can't stop coming back  
Ps- Singapore noodles are the hidden gem on the menu"}
{"text":"Food with care and love, expect a bit of wait but well worth it. Large menu, unique and authentic dishes I have not found else where in TO.
Variety of selection from pho, frog leg, papaya salads, broken rice, sesame chips, tender BBQ meat etc. Service is friendly and attentive. Decor is like a local dive bar but I frequent here often because the food is just that good."}
{"text":"This is, luckily for us, our neighbourhood Vietnamese place. We go once a week and love the food and the owner--she is fantastic! Best items, well you can't go wrong, but the flour shrimp are amazing, as is the mango salad, fresh rolls and anything with noodles. There are three huge TVs always playing, but you can ignore them since the sound is off. Its also a bar and open late. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Awful experience. Food takes forever and doesn't come at the same time. They are more concerned about getting take out food on time. I won't return."}
{"text":"What a find! It's been awhile I had good Vietnamese food. The pho was good but it's the rice dish I'm impressed with. Broken Rice! Not the cheap regular jasmine rice. The rice needs to be broken. The grilled pork is flavourful and steam egg decent. I would definitely come back for the broken rice!"}
{"text":"Pho YES. Pho Nho is a west end favourite. It's a family run business with great homemade food. The service is slow but super friendly. (Take out will take forever --be prepared to wait!). The atmosphere is sometimes overwhelming with music playing over muted tvs but the food is worth it. Sit outside on the patio in the summer, get take out or just indulge in what's there. Everything I've had to eat here is delicious:  fresh rolls, fried rolls,  pho, vermicelli, stewed beef on french bread, pad thai. The beer and booze are cheap. The Wonton Soup is off the hook amazing -- rich brothy soup with plenty of steamed wontons and beautiful cabbage garnish. The pan fried vegetarian rice noodle is really good too. Cash only (ATM in the foyer). If you're getting take out, be patient! It takes forever."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to visiting this
place based on the great Yelp reviews; but I was disappointed all around.

Some might consider the dark appearance of the interior to be \"warm\", but with the basic decor, I just found it gloomy. The constant nuisance of a housefly did not help the ambience.

More importantly, the food was thoroughly average. Spring rolls, vermicelli, fried rice, pho: I've had much better at other restaurants, for cheaper. ($10 for fried rice, really?)

The worst part was probably the wait. The pho only took about 15 minutes to arrive, but there's no excuse for the 35 minutes it took for the other dishes, especially as it was not even remotely busy.

Not worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Went there for my first time yesterday for lunch.  I got a regular Pho and the broth was nice and beefy and the $7 portion was more than enough.

Vegetable spring roll was delicious and flavourful.

My bf got a veggie \"pho\" (vegetable noodle soup, I think it was called on the menu) and it was full of tofu and vegetables.  Was also very good.

I'm looking forward to returning and trying out some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service, comfy atmosphere, prices that are just-right.
Try the 71."}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite Viet place in the city. Reasons:

Decor was nice- was dimly mood-lit, 
Had March Madness on a TV,  
Strange moldings of faces on a few of the walls, 
Somehow they got a hold of my iPod and were playing all my favorites (A Perfect Circle, Metallica, Depeche Mode), 
Probably the BEST veg. spring rolls I've had so far (sorry, Golden T), and a huge bowl of vermicelli with stir-fried beef.
The staff was alarmingly friendly.
 
Two mains, spring rolls, tea = $22.50. Wow.

Only caveats:

Took a while
Cash only
They gave me a fork (RACISM (?) ???)

I'll be back, this was incredibly pleasant.

Also, what kind of Pho place plays APC? My kinda Pho place.

{"text":"I have been to many vietnamese restaurants in Toronto including the \"popular\" Golden Turtle on Ossington, and this place is by far my favourite! Owned by a Vietnamese family, the restaurant is authentic, delicious and cheap! The outside of the building is a little basic and you may not even think to go in, however the food and friendly service are sure wins. 

Ask for the veggie salad rolls (not on menu) - they are amazing!

Note that it is closed on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Small viet cafe/ restaurant on a hidden street almost. You wouldn't notice the place if you aren't really looking for it. Been here many times and always greeted promptly regardless if it's busy. Great looking, bubbly waitresses. This place probably has the best bun bo hue I've ever tasted, as well as the banh canh cua. If you're a coffee lover, DO try the Vietnamese ice coffee. Food does take sometime to prepare. Otherwise very authentic and flavorful unlike anywhere else I've been to. The restaurant has a chill / lounge ambience- dark lighting, candle lit during the evenings, multiple tv screens on the wall. 

Note: the restaurant does only have 6 parking space designated for their customers. If you don't get those, it's pretty hard to find parking elsewhere considering it's located in a small, dead end street. You can probably park a few streets down and walk. I promise, it's worth it. Would highly recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here because my go-to pho place was closed and I was really craving it (go-to pho place is pho my duyen at Bloor & Lansdowne) 

Good pho. My boyfriend had the beef pho, it was good, hearty pho as one would want and expect.

Amazing hot & sour soup. Been eating hot & sour for as long as I can remember, and this was GREAT. Perfect acidity, spice, and sweetness, and I had it with shrimp too, which was also cooked very well and so flavourful. 

Very mediocre veggie platter. One might wonder how a veggie platter could be so mediocre, but it wasn't the veggies. It was the way over cooked, mushy, thick glass noodles that were literally a LUMP that was stuck together beneath the veggies. So flavourless. 

I'd go back, but know not to get those glass noodles again."}
{"text":"Pho Nho? Pho yes!

I've had this place two times now, once as take out and once seated and I am hooooked. First off the women who run this place are really nice and seem to always be in a good mood, so yay for great customer service. 
 
My go to dish isn't pho but forever and always be vermicelli , and they do it really well here. Huge portions and a good mix of veggies and noodles. And for the 8$ price tag you really can't complain. Speaking of money it's cash only but they do have an ATM.

I think one of my favourite parts of Pho Nho is that this restaurant clearly was a Greek restaurant before this but they didn't care to change any of the art or decor. So strange but so awesome. 

You do you Pho Nho."}
{"text":"Very tasty and affordable food. Just don't come if you are in a rush. Services are often slow and a bit unorganized. It happened several times that we received food 10-20 minutes after people who came after us. Also, food never comes together for the whole table.

Overall good place for a diner in the Neighborhood."}
{"text":"Small restaurant but plenty of seats. The service here is quick. The pho portion as are fairly large - only one size, taste great. They accept Cash only, however they do have an ATM in the entrance way. 

The ambience is nice. Good music playing that not overwhelmingly loud. Pho Nho has wifi as well."}
{"text":"Pretty good Pho, nice broth and medium size. Fresh rolls were okay, a bit too much of veggie filler, could have used more protein. Boyfriend liked the sauce so much he was dipping his finger and licking it lol. 

I grabbed the Grilled Pork Vermicelli with Spring Roll. OMG the way the spring roll was fried, nice and crunchy and tasted awesome. Plus the fish sauce with chili flakes, yum!

Open late so might have to come back. Atmosphere seems pretty chill, but wasn't busy when we came (Labour Day Monday). Overall, good Pho place."}
{"text":"Came here for a late snack on Sunday. I had the Pho Hue Style (spicy style) and my girlfriend had the Rare Beef Pho. We started with the Vietnamese rolls with shrimp.  Was decent but I've had better at the Golden Turtle and other Vietnamese places I have reviewed

 Didn't seem like they made the Hue Broth from scratch but rather just added hot sauce to their beef broth. Also on the menu, they said they offered various Vietnamese sandwiches, but only have one."}
{"text":"This place is great. Good food in a spot with character. Tried of squeaky clean sterile looking restaurants. 

Ive had the beef pho, banh mi sandwich, and spring rolls and I liked it all. The sandwich really surprised me, wasn't expecting it to be that tasty. 

No card but there's an ATM at the door so no need to worry. Price is great too. Three of us went for lunch and we ordered a decent amount of food and a couple pitchers of beer and it was about $60 plus tip. Can't ask for much better than that. 

Service was quick but not overbearing. Sometimes you can feel rushed especially when getting multiple shared apps and stuff but everything came out at a good pace. We were able to enjoy the meal, no hassle."}
{"text":"I went to another restaurant and bar once. It was like Pho Nho but it didn't have a big sprawling patio, giant menu of mysteries, or really cold tap beer. 
If you ever want to see how hipsters parents, blue collar drinkers, retirees and gangster youth can get along while watching random sports and listening to random music... Go."}
{"text":"This is my 4th or 5th visit. 

It's a very atypical Vietnamese restaurant. Whoever runs it, was very smart in combining restaurant with several Vietnamese dishes with a full bar/pub experience. Here, all the workers are truly Vietnamese. 

The place is open until 2.00 am everyday with the exception of Tuesday which is the day they are fully close to rest. And yes, if you are wondering, yes they serve food still just before midnight. Yes, yes and yes again. Probably, the only Vietnamese place in town I know that serves food past 9.00 pm. Kool right?! Yes, I know. 

The food is pretty good, for the vast majority not extraordinary but good enough to leave you pleased. Some items are extremely well done like the deep fried Vietnamese rolls (item #133). 

The portions are generous and overall well priced. 

The service is probably one of the best ever experienced in town: attentive, super friendly and never invasive. And if you starting to show your face around often, they recognize you and they acknowledge that without making it feel awkward and/or forced because they hope in a better tip. 

The place isn't too big but is very cozy with always great music playing in the background (mostly from '80s and '90s). In summer this place also offers more space since they have a small balcony in the front with a couple of tables and a pretty big patio right beside the kitchen. 
I came here during the NBA playoffs and dude, lemme tell you that here the ppl go nuts.

In my opinion, the final rate should be more like a 3.5. But since it's open until late like very few in town, I feel generous and I'll go the extra mile by adding an extra .5 star. 
So in the end, I think it's worth the drive to come here and have a proper night out without spending an arm and a leg. 

Definitely worth it! 

:)"}
{"text":"Pho nho is a pho yes!!!   So good- and the extra super sized menu makes it even more desirable- you can order many different types of cuisine!   I will be returning again and again- very delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Unacceptably slow service. Waited 40 min for an order of pho and bun. Drinks took 30 min from time of order. All despite there only being several tables served. 

Would not return unless I had all of the time in the world."}
{"text":"I don't know what people are talking about when they complain about the service, I think it's some of the beat I've had in the city!  When I have to wait a little bit for my  takeout order I always sit at the bar and chat with the ladies and am always offered some water while I wait. Very friendly and very helpful!
Food is delicious! Pho is so good and always leaves me wanting more even though it is a huge portion!
Grilled Pork is fantastic! As are the springrolls.
Love the atmosphere. Kind of a dive bar feel to it."}
{"text":"It's a really nice place, the pho is good, is not amazing, only one size but is a big bowl. The waiters are very attentive."}
{"text":"Come here if you're craving pho late at night (after 9pm)! The broth was not salty and the bowls are huge with lots of soup/noodles. The price is really cheap too. It's great that they're open until midnight! This place really hit the spot for me and don't forget it's Cash ONLY."}
{"text":"Retarded. There was a rock in my vermicelli dish, which I almost broke a molar on. When I brought it to their attention, a rather disastrous lady--no, not a lady persae--accused me of lying, saying \"no ... no ... not possible.\" Very insulting. I have better things to do than planting rocks in my food. Lost my appetite. Terrible and bizarre treatment."}
{"text":"Food was okay but the customer services was AWFUL!!!!! We ordered cold spring rolls for take out but they gave us deep-fried ones. When we called back to confirm, they blamed us for ordering the wrong dish and gave us awkward attitude! and didn't want to exchange for us.  Will NEVER ORDER from them!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was so sad when they stopped being open for lunch. Their dark, sticky atmosphere is perfect for the tasty pho, amazing vermicelli and scrumptious shakes they serve.
(Yes the place is a bit sticky. The best ones are.)
I love the matron of the restaurant. Very loud and direct. Takes no guff but gives lots of love.
I am in the area at lunchtime every day but not when they open at 4pm. I drive by and gaze forlornly."}
{"text":"The waitresses of this place are really cool and effective; they make you feel welcomed, try to make small chat  (point for charming ppl), smile, are fast, accurate, plus look pretty happy in general.

The premises are spacious, I like the lighting (hang over friendly), there are some Tv's showing sports, a patio, parking, and a large bar area.

They offer amazing deals on beer, it's an affordable place to hang out. The ambiance is similar to a Pub but with decent food.

I love the fact that they are open late, they've rescued me from late night broth cravings. Phó is the perfect pre/after party meal, specially when the winter winds are blowing. Phó has become one of my magic potions against the flu, indigestion (just sipped the broth with mint), hangovers, lack of energy, and when feeling like eating noodles.

I've brought friends who also liked the joint, what is not to like when we add: late night+cheap boost+good food???"}
{"text":"Pho Nho you didn't! 

I don't see what there is to complain about this place. Nestled conveniently on the 505 & 506 trolley line, this place is everything you could ask for in your friendly neighborhood Pho establishment. There's ample seating in the winter, not to mention 2 side patios & garage door style patio in the front! Enjoy the Ronces stroller & Bernese mountain dog watching with the sun on your face and wind at your back! The vermicelli was great, pho game was tight, and they do a mean coconut shake if the $3.55 beer selection isn't your thing. They also boast a big screen TV and play the Raptors games w/ commentary, something the \"sports bar\" across the street doesn't do!  

Service has always been friendly and attentive. And if you can't refer to the photos of the menu items(because reading is hard), they are happy to answer any questions. Ok full disclosure, there is a server there who is super babely. Don't tell her I said that though. You'll just make it weird...typical you..."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, very tasty kitchen but the services went down terribly in the past months. It is super slow. By super slow I mean that kind of \"I am dying slow\". It might be a good strategy how to appreciate and enjoy the food once it finally comes, but that gets killed by getting something else than you ordered... during our past 2 visits, we've got our order screwed up both times."}
{"text":"It's a unique pho place in the west end of Toronto in a dark atmosphere with top 40 blasting in the background. It is not a typical Vietnamese restaurant which is well lit and no music. Although you need candles to see the menu, it was refreshing to see a different setup for Asian comfort food.  

The restaurant was able to accommodate our group of 14 and the service was quick. When I passed by the bar, it looked like they wanted to keep the original funky decor. There appears to be lots of regulars who frequent this restaurant and the best part is the bar. They have lots of variety of beers and a full bar which is rare for a place to enjoy the pho. The price for food and drinks cannot be beat too.

Just a note that it is not in the typical neighbourhood and there is not much nearby. I would definitely make the trip to try their food again. Other than music, they also have TVs playing sports and not the typical Viet programs."}
{"text":"such a gem!

hungry, tired, and just craving pho - we found this little awesomeness last week.
Vietnamese deliciousness and cheap house beer - it's so weird but a perfect mix to finish off the week. glad i found this! pho is hot, porkchop is tender, what's not to love. will return when in the area again!"}
{"text":"I've had Pho Nho sitting in my draft box for a few weeks now, and have been twice since I began.  That makes three, and it's kind of interesting how my thought process went \"4 stars?  3?\" after my 1st experience; \"3 stars? 2?\" after my 2nd, and \"2 stars... 1???\" after my third.

Here are some interesting points:

1)  Their congee is not good.  I'm not particularly surprised, but I thought Vietnamese congee might be a nice switch from my love of traditional Chinese congee.  This wasn't.  It was a flavourless, overcooked take on the Chinese I'm accustomed to.

2)  Their spring rolls are unpredictable.  First time good, second time  too chewy (raw) or over-fried and over-greasy (fried).  We didn't order them a third time.

3)  The ubiquitous rice vermicelli with grilled pork and spring rolls is damned tasty save for the spring rolls.  Improve them, and they've got a winner!  The pork's fantastic!

4)  Shakes are good but not great, kind of middle of the road for TO.

5)  Pho is fine, nothing to write home about, and hits the spot.  The shrimp paste soup is very flavourful, and I was amused when they told me something like \"many of you don't like it\".  I assume white folk.  Maybe I misheard.  I don't take offense to these sorts of comments; rather, I revel in them!

6)  Our third trip, a Friday night after 7pm, it transformed into an obnoxious neighbourhood dive bar full of scum bags and loud talkers / yellers chillin' to the anachronistic grooves of 70s and 80s funk music.  There was also what appeared to be a hooker schmoozing with the construction workers, and our server spent a good 10 minutes talking and joking with her rather than bringing us our bill after we asked for it.

7)  Cash only.  No signs anywhere to indicate this save for hidden behind the ATM they not-so-cheerfully direct you to.  Friendly tip for restaurateurs:  DO NOT TRICK ME INTO USING YOUR STUPID ATM.  I will not be happy to pay your $1.75 service fee.

Anyway, points 6 and 7 make me want to drop the rating to a 1, but I'll resist.  They have some redeeming qualities (decent soup, shakes, and fantastic grilled pork), but not enough to convince us to return any time soon.  I work very close by, so it's likely I'll come for a lunch soup on a rainy day... but other than that, there's far better Viet/Thai options within reasonable distance (Pho Phuong at Dundas W & Lansdowne or Pho Linh at College & Dufferin being our faves...)."}
{"text":"Love Pho Nho! Two wonderful servers there who don't take no sass! I actually enjoy the environment it's kinda nice and reminds me of the restaurant that my family had.

I had the Bun Cha and it was fantastic and took care of my viet food craving. 

Don't expect some top notch gourmet food! But expect a pleasant, good food, affordable experience."}
{"text":"Pho nho? Pho YES. 

VIBE: 
If you have ever dreamed of a day that your favourite Asian joint would merge with your favourite dive bar--and if you haven't, we'll never be friends-- allow me to present to you a dream come true. The menu is fat, they offer several beers on tap and have bottle list as well. I had:

PINT O' STELLA: 
It wasn't served in the special Stella glass that makes it clear to everyone around that you are indeed superior to them and their Bud Lite. But it was cold and it was $6. Terribly reasonable. 

PORK SRING ROLLS: 
Jeese Louise. They bread and deep fry these puppies to artery-clogging perfection and then submerge them in crushed peanuts-- not for the faint of heart, the allergic or the body-conscious. The coating is thick and crusty, and the pork filling is soft and delicious, and the sauces they serve them with are delish. A-MAH-ZING.

RARE BEEF PHO: 
The phact that I haph nepher eaten pho bepho this is phoking ridiculous. Hot, tasty, massive bowl of noodles. By the time the dish gets to your table the beef is cooked, so I would definitely reccomend this over their cooked beef option. They serve with 'fresh veggies' to toss in, which is basically a plate heaped with bean sprouts. It was like $7, fully yummo, I didn't come close to finishing it, and I think it cured my cold. NICE!"}
{"text":"Lovely family fun business!
Great customer service! 
Great food! And awesome atmosphere 
Thanks John! (And sister(s)?"}
{"text":"My friends and I come here quite often bc it's more of a vietnamese bar and restaurant. In the summer time, they got a patio and we drink and eat mon nhau aka vietnamese dishes that you eat when you drink. Not too many vietnamese restaurants offer mon nhau in the city. They have beers on draft, mixed drinks, and sangria. We always orders the nuoc mam (fish sauce) chicken wings, and their goi and the usual pho, or bun bo hue, and rice dishes. 

It's a mixed crowd. The decor is dated but we're only concerned about the food. If theyre busy - food takes a really long time to come out. And it's cash only - but they have an ATM. They do have TVs inside and you can catch the game. We always come here if we feel like eating viet and drinking LOL. The exterior definitely looks a bit sketchy - but it's good food."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Atmosphere is more like a bar and not so much like a traditional Vietnamese restaurant which is kinda cool. Waiters and staff are soo nice an friendly. Food is delicious here! Definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"My first visit was OK. But second time was brutal. Their chicken #50 was so terrible and the service was super slow. Don't waste your money or time"}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite neighbourhood joints!!  For years and years I would pass by Pho Nho and never give it a second look because it kinda looks like a sleazy bar where old men gather from the outside.  And truth be told, some older locals do hang out at the bar regularly, but it's awesome none the less!

Firstly, the staff are all super friendly and remember you when you come back.  Yes, there are a few big screen tvs, which could be good or bad, depending on what ambiance you're going for.  I'm surprised by a previous reviewer's comment about the spring rolls being \"unpredictable\".  We almost always get them, they're deep fried, spiced just right, chopped into bite sized pieces and delicious!

Other consistently good items are the pho (reg & hue style), mango salad, beef stew, and the many various shakes/specialty drinks.  Cozy atmosphere, good prices, yummy food....and it's open late nearly every day (closed Tuesdays though)."}
{"text":"Pho Nho! Oh no! Was disappointed in my chicken vermicelli. It bordered on gross. I ate it, but it wasn't good. I will not be coming back. 

Lovely service though."}
{"text":"Good phó everyone craving for that hot noodle soup. Prices are reasonable. Friendly staff. Nice and clean inside. You just need to have patience waiting for the food. That kept me from giving another star."}
{"text":"A friend and I walked fifteen minutes in the rain to get to Pho Nho and it was worth it.

The place apparently used to be an Italian bar. It has an arched stucco ceiling and a pretty wooden bar with brass fixings, and beer taps built into the brick wall. There's a big garage door window in the front that swings open. It's really pleasant, cosy almost to the point of being cramped in the bar area. (Of course we were getting takeout.) Sadly it's not very accessible as there are stairs up to get in and a narrow door.

The bartender took our orders and the food was slow coming, but again, turned out to be worth it. The vegetarian pho ($7.50) comes with a huge pile of rice noodles, two kinds of tofu, bok choy and other veggies, and I could only eat half of what I got.

Bring cash because they don't take any kind of plastic."}
{"text":"My experience is only based on customer service and how they run a business. I went here tonight because it's 1 am and I'm craving pho.. I was willing to drive a tad out of the way for it. 

Called them and was told food would be done in 15 minutes and when I arrived when within that time she told me to wait longer because it wasn't ready. This place has no customers at this time so why was the end result waiting 25 minutes for takeout? Unbelievable to find out not only was their service horrible but they failed to mention to me they only take cash. How do these businesses not take major credit cards? Didn't pay for my order and I left.

Super unhappy with this place. I would love to try the food just to know if this place is worth coming back to.."}
{"text":"Came here a couple times during the time I worked in the area. The space is pretty huge so it's great for large groups. The food comes very very slow though. The quality is up to par of other pho places, though the wait is definitely not worth it. Call ahead if you really want to get something here."}
{"text":"I almost forgot to review this place, because I forgot the name! Bad girl. 

I HAVE to go back! I was walking on Dundas W on a lazy Sunday and decided to have some vietnamese. Pho Nho saved me. GREAT GIANT dishes served as spiced as I was expecting. They offer a booklet with pictures of every meal, so you know exactly what you're asking for. And YEP, it's not like fast food and you get what's in the picture!!!! 

The waitress, as expected, could barely speak english (this is probably why they have the pictures) and was alone to serve everyone. But the food was served in a reasonable time and was really great. I usually don't ask for Pho because I'm not a fan of noodles, so I asked for a vegetable soup. Husband got a Pho. Both were GINORMOUS and great. 

And hooray it's cheap."}
{"text":"Pumped up 'cause the English speaking waitress actually said, \"Do you have any questions for me??\"  I was pretty impressed by that as I usually don't expect much in terms of service at Vietnamese/Chinese/other ethnic restaurants that aren't all that $$$!

Waitress was quite peppy.

I ordered the Mixed Beef Pho (rare & well done), one size, $7.  Size of bowl was probably closer to a medium, definitely not the same size as a small $5-6 bowl.  Looking through the menu, other things seems a bit more expensive, re:  $3.85 for a Viet Coffee, $3.85 fruit milkshakes, just under $5 for a sandwich, etc.  HOWEVER, I didn't see the size portion of any of these items.

Atmosphere was more café/neighbourhood bar!"}
{"text":"Yup. These guys still have the best pho! Been coming to this place for years and now we regularly do takeout. Recommended: rare beef pho, vermically with pork spring roll, Singapore noodles, fresh rolls.

Love the service, too! Everyone here is so lovelyyy."}
{"text":"If you looking for the Pho Place that homemade and CLEAN and HEALTHY. Trust me , this is the one. 
On dinner rush, the food may not come out as fast as you expect because of the fresh meat is cooked for you so it will taste so juicy. They grill and cook from RAW when you order ."}

Wound up there late after a trying day trip to Toronto, based on the Yelp reviews and the fact that it was close to the 24 hour auto shop where we needed to have a tire unexpectedly changed.  So we arrived late-ish (around 8:30pm) and hadn't eaten all day.  We had two young children with us who were very tired and hungry.  It didn't appear to be particularly crowded.

As soon as we sat down, I told our server we wanted to put in an appetizer order right away while we decided what to order.  She took the appetizer order ... then left it on the table.  We didn't receive the appetizers until well after we gave our full order.  She gave us all tea, then asked if the children wanted water.  They agreed.  She never brought the water during the 1.5 hours we were there.

We ordered two noodle dishes for the adults, and two bahn mi for the kids.  After we'd already waited a half hour, a server came over to say they only had ONE bahn mi left, so which one did we want.  I'm not even sure what that meant.  They only had one piece of bread left?  We ordered a pork bahn mi and decided rather than trying to order something else, my other daughter would just share my dish.

After an hour of waiting, it was well past ten, our two noodle dishes arrived, and no bahn mi at all.  I thought maybe they were running behind, so we waited a little longer, then I flagged down a server to ask where my daughter's meal was.  She came back to inform us that it had been BURNED.  Did we want to order something else?  They would prepare it fast.  Seriously?  I said no, I wanted the check immediately.  I had to ask three more times for the check, one of my children was in tears from hunger and disappointment, then discovered they only take cash.  The only cash machine on the premises didn't take any of my cards -- not Visa, not Mastercard, debit, credit, nothing -- fortunately we had enough cash between us to scrape up for the bill.  Then we had to stop at McDonald's on the way home.

Thanks \"pho\" nothing."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. It's a convenient neighbourhood restaurant. Pho and bun is ok. I wouldn't make a trip to eat here, but if you are in area and craving pho and cheap- this would do."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times recently. Good Vietnamese food in a kind of hipster venue. The low lighting and chill service are a nice switch from what one expects. Well prepared dishes and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Ok i love this place because of the family feel and that everyone here is friendly and when your serve smiles you know she means it. I love that the family owned and the food is like mama was in the kitchen cooking just for you. When you taste the food you can tell its cooked with love. So next time you come over say hi to q"}
{"text":"I want to like this place. I really do. The servers are sweet. Occasionally the food is really good. IF you can stand to wait a ridiculous amount of time for your food. This week we waited over 40 minutes for two bowls of pho. The woman in the kitchen kept shooting us dirty looks because apparently out order was getting in the way of her leaning on the wall.

It's even worse with groups. Last time we made the mistake of going with more than two people, it took almost 2 hours to feed eight people. Half the table didn't have food for the first hour. This is common.

I'm sorry, but if you don't know how to expedite service properly or grasp the concept of working on more than one order at a time, do not open a restaurant! It's so simple! Look up Mise En Place and embrace it! 

So, I'd you have a few hours to kill, by all means give it a try. Otherwise, go over to Pho Phoenix at College and Sheridan."}
{"text":"Excellent food, attentive service. Really warm neighborhood vibes. Good patio. Highly recommended. Closed Tuesdays."}
