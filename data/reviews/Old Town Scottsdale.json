{"text":"Tourist trap, but fun. Most of the stores now are new and sell crappy tourist items but some shops are cool authentic shops that sell some pretty cool items. Parking on the street was free. Spent about an hour here and saw all we wanted."}
{"text":"Awesome shop's, most friendly people and great food... always a place to go visit while in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Continue your tour of the Arizona area and you will see Camelback and the Tank mountains. We did not stop to hike but we drove thru the area and we did see them. In Old Scottsdale it is a take back to the western vibe that it once was. Yes, there are many stores to pick up your beautiful silver and turquoise jewelry. Find a place to park and get ready to walk the area. You can take the buggy ride, or just pet the horse, it's up to you. Musicians playing music in one of the areas, beautiful sounds coming from the flutes of those that are playing and CD's ready to sell. Stop for a cold drink at any of the bars in the area. Check this off your hit list of cities to visit while you are in the Arizona area. Huge modern buildings in the newer area of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Old Town Scottsdale during a recent weekend trip, and it was just okay. We were there on a Saturday afternoon but the entire place was deserted. Most of the art galleries were open, but there was no one in them or walking around on the street. Strange vibe...but it was a good place to kill 30 mins or so."}
{"text":"all I can say about old town is this: If you're young and up for a great night out with lots of options as far as bars, lounges and great restaurants...you will have a blast!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a tourist area so be forewarned.  Old Town Scottsdale is an area of downtown Scottsdale full of art galleries, restaurants, and kitschy shopping. The things I love about it include free street parking (with a 3 hour limit) and the fact that its walker-friendly.  There is also a free trolley that you can catch to get a lay of the land with stops throughout the area and the mall.  The only minus is that their stuff is geared toward older and/or richer visitors and is very kitschy.  I loved it my first time around when I had never been to Scottsdale, but after my recent visit I would be okay skipping it.   Nonetheless, visit it at least once."}
{"text":"Just walking around the shops was pretty cool, but there was also an art show in town when we went. There were living statues, horse and buggy rides, and the bars/restaurants were pretty awesome, too! We'll definitely go back next time we're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"If you've never been to Scottsdale, you have to check out Old Town at least once just to say you've been. It's true, it's super touristy, but that's why you should go, right? You're a tourist. Souvenir shops are the quickest way to get a summary of what an area is known for. It's interesting to just walk around and do some window shopping.   It's easy to find and parking is free."}
{"text":"I know it's a tourist trap, but you must go. Lots of bars and restaurants to choose from, plenty of jewelry shops, novelty souvenir shops, art galleries of paintings, pottery, and more."}
{"text":"Cute shops - a couple of decent hole-in-the-wall bars - Bandera is a great place to eat - Italian Grotto has some of the worst service I have ever seen.....worth stopping and walking around"}
{"text":"In the daytime, Old Town is a cool destination for boutique shopping, great restaurants, art and culture.  In the nighttime, Old Town is your go-to for clubs, bars, still great restaurants, and people watching.    There are a ton of local shops where you can find anything from doggie sweaters to baked goods to Navajo jewelry to couture fashion to cowboy boots and red-dirt-shirts.  The restaurants range from chains like Ra and Grimmaldis to local spots like Daily Dose and RnR.  The Arts District is  a great place for festivals of all kinds and is right behind the Scottsdale Historical Museum.  There is something here for everyone!  A free trolly will take you around downtown if you can figure out when and where to get on and off.  At night there are plenty of rickshaws to transport you to the next bar, and no lack of cabs to get you home safely.    A day or night on this town will have you digging deeper in to your pockets than if you chose downtown Tempe or even Phoenix, but it is definitely a unique experience."}
{"text":"Old Town Scottsdale - ten hundred tchotchke shops in a contrived wild west setting - all selling the same stuff.  Nothing unique or original. But we did get some great close-ups of a hummingbird hanging around one of the salvias planted along the street which saved this outing from being a complete and utter snoozefest."}
{"text":"Our hotel was awesome enough to have beach cruisers you could borrow to ride around downtown. This is the only reason why my friend and I got all the way to Old Town on our one and a half hour break until dinner. It is such a cute little area. I loved all the little shops they had. It felt like we were walking around in an old cowboy town and I couldn't help but yell \"YEE HAW!\" I just had to get it off my chest."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this. But I didn't. Maybe bc it was 103 degrees. But maybe because all the stores were lame schlocky has-been tourist traps."}
{"text":"Lots of cute shops and restaurants. Really informative museum with great western art, saddles, guns, Native American pottery."}
{"text":"Love Old Town Scottsdale.  So many shops and restaurants to browse at.  Bars & clubs are always packed on the Thursday, Fridays, and Saturdays.  Make sure you don't drink and drive and Scottsdale P.D. are always out in full force on the weekends, holidays, and during special events."}
{"text":"After spending an afternoon in Old Town I feel like this area of Scottsdale is torn between two identities. Does it want to be a tourist trap or a foodie, arts, shopping haven? Probably a little bit of both, and it takes on these identities with pride. \"The West's most western town\" will provide you with an afternoon or evening of activities, great restaurants, and plenty of Native American themed shops. There is free 3 hour time limit parking available in abundance and a free trolley service that loops around Old Town, perfect for those painfully hot days.   Our first stop was Mexican Imports and we really enjoyed it. It's basically a large Mexican themed gift shop geared towards tourists, but some of the items for sale are really interesting. After that we took the free self-guided walking tour. The tour showcases some of Old Town's historic spots and takes you right past the beautiful Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art. Some of the places on this tour are very cool, like the still functioning blacksmith shop, the olive trees, and the Sugar Bowl, but others can be skipped - sorry, but there is nothing historic about your public library or city hall.   Old Town is worth checking out. We really enjoyed the day we spent there. We ate a great meal at The Mission, had delicious camelback sodas at the Sugar Bowl, and got a kick out of the \"Old West\" atmosphere of this area. As always, bring plenty of water, as it does get extremely hot!"}
{"text":"Old Town is a part of Scottsdale that tries to maintain a Wild West feel. Yes, it is a tourist trap, but still interesting nonetheless. It is filled with a bunch of bars, galleries, restaurants and many shops selling Native American themed crafts and souvenirs. Lots of interesting sculptures in the street as well."}
{"text":"Best location in AZ!  I love old town!  Wouldn't want to live anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Old Town is an excellent location to bring out of town visitors. Lots of places to shop for \"authentic\" Arizona Native American (Indian) and western merchandise.  There is an abundance of great places to eat. If your into Art there is an Art District here with plenty of gallery's.   There is trolley to take you all over town that stops along the way so you can do some exploring on your own.   There are two comedy clubs to entertain you. The Comedy Spot and Standup Scottsdale. Both offer a verity of local and national comedians.  The nightlife here offers some of the most clubs and bars in the country.  Parking can be a problem at times but don't get discouraged it's worth driving around to find a spot.   There is so much more to do in Old town. I haven't even begun to scratch the surface in this review. A bit on the pricy side at some of the shops but hey you can  window shop if nothing else or find yourself a  great place to eat.  ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood to walk around, shop and eat this is your place. Great stores to look at it with a small town feel. Awesome place to check out if you are not from the area."}
{"text":"You can find it all in old town: workouts, juice, ice cream, wine, nightlife, hot breakfast and brunch spots, date night, western gear, boutique shops, coffee shops, art galleries, pairing classes, entertainment, music, festivals.... You name it.   Good place to come and have some fun but also a good place to get away from for some peace and quiet."}
{"text":"I love old town, whether it's fine dining or a night out! Check out their Facebook page for events!"}
{"text":"So, you want to know what Old Town is like? Just don't judge, it's freakin' awesome.    Where else can you meander around charming art galleries (I recommend the Lisa Sette Gallery) and see a drunk man relieve himself behind dumpsters in the same night (I recommend parking your car in a private lot within walking distance of American Junkie, Drift and Dirty Pretty)? You can go from class to trash and back again.    To illustrate this further, let me give you a run down of a typical Scottsdale night. Remember, I said no judging!  There are a million places to start off the night with drinks and appetizers. I won't tell you where I go, because I don't want to see you there. After a good buzz develops and I've had something to eat, so I can pace myself for the evening ahead, I'll choose from a plethora of activities depending on the night. If it's Thursday, I might decide to just walk around since all the art galleries are open. On the weekends, I'll probably dance to a live band or laugh at people trying to work it on a stripper pole at Dirty Pretty. If I'm not in the mood to rub up against sweaty bodies, I'll embarrass myself at a karaoke bar. My favorite karaoke song happens to be I touch Myself, but only because it's easy to sing. See, Scottsdale has variety.    Later in the night, I may work my way back to more relaxed hangouts where I can actually have a conversation. I will usually continue to drink, so I'm not saying the conversation is good. After I've worked up a drunk fueled craving for food, my friends and I head to Philly Sandwich Co. I've already yelped about how I love watching drunk people eat subs to loud urban music, but eating isn't the only way to cap off the night and I try to not give into drunk cravings too often. So what is a girl to do? How about a trip to Zorba's? You should ask for a tour.   So that's Scottsdale. A little bit of culture and a lot of debauchery. Have fun. And, if debauchery isn't your thing, after perusing the art galleries you can always settle for the best milkshake of your life at the Sugar Bowl."}
{"text":"This charming little town has plenty to offer history buffs. Full of fascinating heritage, culture and old world charm. Lots of shops, restaurants, tours and  parking. They also have a Trolley, Horse Buggy rides and Segway tours to get around."}
{"text":"Old town Scottsdale! So much to see here ,and it is a great place to bring guests  from out of town. Right now it is decorated all for the Holidays ,which is great! We really like to look at the nice displays. It has been the place to check out for as long as I can remember. Even as far back as when I was a kid.  Some places come and go and others have been here for a very long time. The list is endless on what you can find here. Country and Western, as well as rock, punk ,and new music.  The Places to eat are endless,so it is really hard to choose a favorite. Parking can at times be tough to find.  Lots of great artwork all over to look at. At times they even have some great festivals as well!"}
{"text":"Cute shops. Horse and bufggy rides. Beautiful scenery. Love  this area. Lived near here for a few years and enjoyed the night life also. The restaurants rock! great gelato also."}
{"text":"I really need to plan my trips better................why do I always try to find parking in Old Town on a Saturday afternoon?!  Don't I realize that's prime time for a cerveza @ Agave Tequila?! Do I forget so easily that's when the tourists love a taste of goodness from The Sugar Bowl?! Would I be redundant by stating it's the best time for a veggie plate at Pita House? Or housemade lahvosh at The Grapevine? I'll say this......the roundabout way of finding a parking spot is totally worth it for any of the above! And don't even get me started on the shopping / galleries / people-watching activities! THIS can be a great Saturday (or any day) afternoon for locals and tourists and snowbirds alike :)"}
{"text":"It was fine for a day trip. Every junk AZ souvenir you could imagine. Prices vary by store so do your due diligence when shopping and just be willing to go back if you wanna save a few bucks."}
{"text":"A town with so much see and shop! It's right across the street from the waterfront. Find the Lime Bikes for rental or stroll along the path for unique shops!   Looking for souvenirs? There's several shops along the way."}
{"text":"I had a ton of fun in Old Town Scottsdale.  Probably too much fun in fact.  This is due to stopping for a drink at many of the bars.  There are tons of bars within a few blocks and I had to try many of them.  There are all different styles of bars but since it was Old Town Scottsdale I preferred the old western style saloons the best.  The others I went to were good as well, but those were my favorite.  There is tons of parking and many shops from nice to super touristy.  Worth a day, of half day, or few hour visit no matter what you are into."}
{"text":"Very nice area to shop, wander and enjoy local boutiques. Guests always enjoy it here. They have plenty of options to stop for a bite too."}
{"text":"Western looking town w/ shops and restaurants. They do have a self guiding walking tour to explore the city.  I just took some photos and went on my way."}
{"text":"What a really nice place.  If you're in the Phoenix or Scottsdale area, you really must come here.  The establishment maintained the Old Town look and feel, yet it is very clean and trendy.  There are so many restaurants, shops and art studios here.  It's a great place to stroll in case you don't want to eat or shop too.  Both day and night time offers a quaint view and feel.  When I come back to this area, I will always make at least one visit here.  So should you."}
{"text":"The heart beat of Arizona. Old Town gives life to this desert with fantastic restaurants, sophisticated shopping, and a youthful nightlife.   A must see when visiting the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"When you are in Scottsdale - be sure to check out Old Town Scottsdale. It essentially is divided into 2 sections - the one area is full of Old Wild West type stores - complete with wooden store front facades - Mexican Western stores and kitsch and across Scottsdale road there is another area full of galleries, and high-end stores.  Both areas offer alot of opportunities to shop, take pictures and stroll away and afternoon. There are several types of restaurants to choose from too, from more high end like \" the Mission\" to pizza places like \"Grimaldi's\" or fast food.  After walking around this area, we were so glad we did and definitely would have felt like would have missed out had we not gone. I would definitely recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"As a daytime attraction, Old Town Scottsdale is comparable to all of the other tourist traps I have visited in North America.   As soon as I spotted the Del Sol store, the bellwether for all things touristy, I knew what I was in for; store after store filled with western themed crappity crap. Do I need a t-shirt that says \"My Indian name is Runs With Beers\", umm, not so much.   There is the odd store that does have some better quality goods and there is a certain charm to the obvious theme so I think Old Town is worth visiting once so you can say \"been there, done that\"."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Old Town!  It's like a step back into the Wild West with modern day amenities.  It was my husband's first time this weekend and I was really excited for him to finally go.  It's a compact part of town, with so much fit into it, that it's easy to spend a weekend there.  Whether you're browsing the artisan jewelers, visiting galleries/museums, exploring native pottery shops/or regular token souvenir shops, or looking for an ice cream, tacos, cocktails, burgers, pizza.... they have it all!  Parking is mostly street parking, and since it's such a popular spot with locals and tourists alike, be prepared to hunt for a spot.  There's no way to describe it without experiencing it, so definitely go if you can!"}
{"text":"It is what it is...a tourist trap with a few real finds stuck in between.  How can so many \"native jewelry\" shops have 70 to 80% off is beyond me and I'm sorry but selling baskets in a \"western\" type store that are made in Pakistan?????? WTH!  There were a couple of good stores in there that were fun to look at and a few good restaurants but mostly it is a just walk around and look at all of the stuff type of place just so you can say you saw it, tick it off your list.  And if you are going to buy anything, make sure you read the labels very very well!"}
{"text":"It's one thing to charge a $12 minimum for a ride less than a half a mile away. It's another thing to inform someone of this after you've arrived at the destination. On top of that this guy didn't even have any change. What a scheister!"}
{"text":"I have traveled to Scottsdale for years and always have enjoyed Old Town. This place has change a ton with more new, hot restaurants, places to live as well as the nightlife. The Art Walk on Thursday's is a great event. Many of the galleries in Scottsdale made it through the tough times and are busier. My favorite bookstore, Poison Pen, an excellent mystery bookstore makes its home in Old Town.   There's the megamall complete with higher end chain restaurants such as YardHouse for those who need air conditioning in the summer. Every cuisine is represented from tapa, to steak to sushi to incredible Southwestern food at The Mission.  Enjoy a baseball game, a horse and buggy ride or rent a bike and enjoy Old Town Scottsdale. Grab a calendar of events as the Civic Center has an excellent art show along with family events all year."}
{"text":"Old Town Scottsdale - It's like a mullet: business during the day, with their Western, Native American, and Art scenes and a party at night, with all the bars, clubs, and restaurants, with an added bonus of FREE parking!   Day Time Activities: -Art Walks every Thursday -Stroll along the Civic Center Mall (it's a beautifully landscaped chunk of land lined with restaurants and museums) -Scottsdale Culinary Festival (usually in April at the Civic Center Mall) -Spring training games at Scottsdale Stadium -Fashion Square Mall -Scottsdale Waterfront -SUGAR BOWL - an Old Town ice cream store staple! -Touristy Native American Jewelry and gift boutiques  Nightlife Activities: -Restaurants - There are way too many to name and list so I suggest utilizing the Yelp Search function and check out reviews  -Tons of bars to get wastey face at- Yes, you have your fancy pants, bling-bling bars like The Mint. You also can find plenty of casual dive bars like Dos Gringos, Loco Patron, and Coach House. There are tons of pedicabs available for your bar hopping pleasure. -Karaoke at the ultra low key Grapevine or get a private room and sushi at Geishia A Go Go (and also check out their high tech Japanese toilets - amazing!) -Laugh your butt off at Stand-up Comedy Club with shows at 8 and 10 pm -Check out a concert at the Venue of Scottsdale  Don't hate just because it's in \"Snotsdale\" . Give it a chance, have an open mind, you might just enjoy it. It's okay to keep it a secret so it doesn't hurt your hipster cred, but seriously, who doesn't love mullets?"}
{"text":"Clean - Yes Nightlife - Yes for 30-something's - good Happy Hour prices at the bars. Lots of Shops - Yes Unique - No  Why, because there are waaaayyy too many jewelry shops.  It's turquoise overload!  They all have signage 50-70% off!  Hmmm, I wonder why?  There isn't enough unique shops in my opinion.  So if you are looking for a beautiful piece of jewelry - then this is the place to go.  Clothing and home furnishings - not so much.  Lots of art galleries, but most of them were closed on Sunday.  Nightlife - well, we tried to find a place that might have a live band to get our groove on (dancing) and we were out of luck.  Lot's of 30 somethings drinking up at all the bars so every one of them was lively and crowded.  But I get turned off when the girls get drunk and sloppy and the men have to say, \"Oh, please excuse my wife!\" as he's trying to hold her up.  Whew, okay then."}
{"text":"Old Town Scottsdale is a wonderful boutique shopping area that is a throwback to the era before massive shopping centers and strip malls.    You can casually walk the streets with your family while enjoying eclectic shops, candy stores, cowboy decor and great dining.  Enjoy the beautiful Phoenix weather and take a time machine back to the wild west.  From Capriotti's fine sandwiches to Grimaldi's Pizza and Italian food, there is something for everyone.  Just be sure to leave some room for desert at the Sugar Bowl.  Also be sure to check the galleries and pottery shops.  There are plenty of nice hotels near Old Town that provide shuttles to the area if you'd prefer to skip the parking hunt.    If you are visiting the region don't miss out on this Arizona jewel.  John Wayne's ghost seems to wander the streets with a smile.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"In all my years of coming to Scottsdale, I had never really explored Old Town.  My parents found a Farmers' Market, so we decided to check it out one Saturday morning, and had some time to explore some of the galleries and shops.  Old Town is a mix of touristy shops selling desert art, clothing and jewelry, restaurants and art galleries.  The Farmers' Market has a great mix of organic fruits and vegetables, bakeries, Italian and other ethnic foods, and more.  Plenty of delicious samples to try!  The area is walkable, with information booths and guides to help you.  Definitely an area I would like to explore some more!"}
{"text":"Old town could be special, but instead it is largely a tourist trap. Some wonderful restaurants and shops to be sure, but also some real fools and downright nasty ones too. Had our car vandalized right in front of the Mexican restaurant we ate at. Had a shop owner follow us out onto the sidewalk screaming at us (really) because we tried to negotiate a better price. Not going back and never taking our out of town guests there again."}
{"text":"During off season everything closes early. Though large, many of the stores are very touristy and honky tonk."}
{"text":"Lots of hate directed towards OTS, and I can see some of the reasons being legit. But, theyre not taking OTS for what it is: a tourist stop! If you're looking for a 5th Avenue NYC experience, you're gonna have a bad day!  Pros: its clean, lots of restaurants and bars, lots of Native American-inspired shops, art galleries, a nice park with greenery and fountains, and that old school Scottsdale feel in the architecture.  Cons: parking is horrible, its overcrowded with pasty Canadians in winter, and full of utter douchenozzles at night when OTS turns into Miami Beach West. Those dang lit up golf carts with sound systems shutting around said douchers are the most ANNOYING things of all time. I cant wait for the day I see one stuffed with \"woohoo\" girls and douchers in UFC shirts to get t-boned by a Ford F-450 at an intersection. The sight of fake boobs and aviator sunglasses flying all over the place might provoke a chuckle out of me. Same goes for those ridiculous poser pedal bars."}
{"text":"It's a little hard to know what to make of Old Town Scottsdale; it seems like an odd mash of things. On one hand you have a sparse area of old shops hawking kitschy baubles with a few tired horse carriages. Immediately next door is a sprawling ultra-new arts and entertainment area which apparently carries a dress code of oversized sunglasses, designer purses and botox. And yet, on the other side is a more tranquil area with the city hall, arts museum and a nice central greenspace.  An odd mix to ponder, but perhaps something for everyone?"}
{"text":"I almost didn't stop here because I figured it would just be a bunch of touristy junk.  Which it is. But it was also a beautiful place to stroll around, people watch, take in a little history, buy touristy junk, sample some food and listen to music.  I parked near here to go to Orange Table for breakfast and since it was just up over the hill I thought I'd pop in for some cactus jam or something.  What a wonderful place! I was immediately greeted by the soft, jazzy tunes of a street musician.  The traffic wasn't too crazy. There were people everywhere. Lots of fun shops.  If you want to find touristy junk, I would probably go here.  Be careful, one thing might cost something in one store and be cheaper in another, but all-in-all this is a lively, lovely place to wander. It made me cheerful!"}
{"text":"I really liked Old Town Scottsdale as a tourist and I have a feeling if I lived in Scottsdale I would love it too!    A compact, but diverse area with souvenir shops, art galleries, western wear and tons of restaurants (to name just some of the things you can find).    I loved all the MLB team flags down the street for Spring Training. Plus the vibe of the place was electric.  I highly recommend!    Parking is a bit of a pain, but you just have to hunt, you will find a spot!"}
{"text":"We spent about four hour here. First for lunch at the Rusty Spur Saloon. Then shopping and walking around and in between stopped for a drink and appetizers at Grapevine and RNR Gastropub.  I really enjoyed Old Town. Loved the southwest feel and the people were really nice. Just under 30 minute drive from Phoenix."}
{"text":"Tons of shops. TONS. Many restaurants, too. It's very touristy, but that's ok. It's cute. Could spend many hours here. I only had about an hour to shop."}
{"text":"Spend the day walking around the many shops, restaurants, galleries, and western shops.  You'll find galleries with anything from Native American to Russian art!  A huge range of restaurants to choose from, and a bit of that old west Arizona charm.  Check for special events, like wine festivals, farmers markets, and art walks.  At night, one of the best areas to go out in Phoenix, everything from pubs and piano bars to dancing, and pool side bars.  Just know parking can be crazy and prices can be high!"}
{"text":"It's not nearly as cool as Old Town San Diego is, but it will do.  Parking is great.  I don't know what I did to please the parking gods in this place, but I always manage to get it great.  Lots of shops specializing in southwest and Indian art jewelry.  Many many food places.  And plenty of space to just walk around and browse.  As far as character though, it doesn't have much.  Which is probably why I can always find parking here.  heh."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  God bless the tourists and all the fun bars!"}
{"text":"Fun place to explore, they have a lot of shops, sights, and restaurants for your pleasure. You can spend some good quality time here, it's a nice area and most seem to enjoy it, I know I did.  I've stayed in Scottsdale twice and went here both times. I'd say it's good for all ages, do check it out if you're in town."}
{"text":"Anybody who complains about the \"faux western style\" better sit back down. Are you kidding me? This little old town is so awesome to walk around. Clean, kitschy, friendly.  Also, one of the best farmers markets is here. Awesome soft serve.  Sure. It has tons of \"authentic native\" jewelry stores that make you question what the word authentic really means. Guess what? Don't shop there then?   All in all, an awesome adventure packed with lots of cool little boutiques and eateries."}
{"text":"We spent a few hours strolling around Old Town Scottsdale before dinner tonight.   It's a very sweet neighborhood of maybe a hundred different places of business- bars and restaurants and coffee shops and stores of all description.   You'll find something for everyone here."}
{"text":"This was my third or fourth visit to Old Town Scottsdale. I remembered it as a charming place with lots of stores where you could buy local arts and crafts and souvenirs that you could not buy anywhere else, including Native American crafts and art. I have a number of things that I purchased on previous trips to Scottsdale. However, in the last four years Old Town Scottsdale has been transformed into a giant jewelry store separated by bars and burger joints. I did manage to find a couple of good shops where I could buy souvenirs. I made sure that I left some money in those stores in hopes that they will still be there the next time I am in Scottsdale.  But, for me, the charm is gone. Old Town Scottsdale is looking more and more like a Cruise Ship Port than an oasis of western arts and crafts."}
{"text":"Old Town Scottsdale (aka Downtown Scottsdale) is a centralized district that offers a wide selction of boutique shops that peddle souvenirs, jewelry with a Southwestern flair, and trinkets of all sorts. Walking through, we noticed there were a handful of art galleries for tourist to browse or purchase unique pieces. In addition to the shopping, OTS offers a variety of restaurants, bars, and clubs to entertain you from anything like a Sunday brunch to a night on the town. Albeit a touristy area, it was still a wonderful area to walk around with the dogs and enjoy the parks and flowers on a warm December afternoon.    My husband and I visited this area specifically to enjoy a stroll with the pups and to grab breakfast after our hike. There were a handful of dog friendly restaurants with patios for us to choose from.  We enjoyed our breakfast and took in the sights during our walk. It was hustling and bustling during our visit since it was around a holiday. It is worth a stop to check the area out for their various dining opportunities and walk around,"}
{"text":"After our trip through all the awesomeness that we were able to see in our 1 week trip to Arizona we came back to Phoenix for 1 day to wait for our return flight back home to Chicago.    I can't believe how hot it was.  We drove to downtown Phoenix where the temperature was hovering at 108 degrees.  Now everyone tries to tell you oh it's a dry heat.  My response so is walking into an oven, but it doesn't mean I want to walk into an oven.  Anywho when we arrived in downtown we expected to see some sign of activity.  NADA not a single sole was out on the street.    While we were trying to find something to do without frying I was searching through Yelp (what else?) to try find some points of interest.  That's when I spotted human life, another car filled with people.  I crossed  the barren street and asked the driver if he could recommend anything while we were waiting for our return flight wo/wandering too far from the airport.  He suggested Old Town Scottsdale.  At this point we were looking for something to do so we took his advice and went to Old Town Scottsdale.  This area is kind of like a combination of the old west. There are a number of shops, restaurants & bars in an area several block area.  It's not the most exciting area of been to, but it gave us something to do & an ability to duck into some of the stores to cool ourselves off while we planned our next stop.   We actually wanted to try Little Miss Barbecue which is rated 5 stars on Yelp, but that's another review."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot for a night walk and some window shopping, a weekend stroll for lunch and actual shopping, or bringing that visiting friend / family member to show them the artsy side of Scottsdale while getting a bite to eat from a great restaurant!  It is also really close to Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall - so if you get too hot or want some indoor shopping, you can just talk a bit of a longer walk over to that hot spot (or drive!).  There are a ton of great restaurant and wine bars throughout Old Town also, so you could go dozens of times and never eat the same thing twice - that's awesome in and of itself!  Overall: A Great for locals, great for foodies, great for tourists."}
{"text":"Old Town is a different place during the night & day.  I'm a fan of Old Town.  Here's why:  Daytime - There's plenty of outdoor shopping.  Great for walking around during the Fall/Winter/Spring seasons.  - Large variety of restaurants in a small area.  You can make last minute decisions/changes and still end up at a nice place to eat.  - Wide variety of restaurants.  From fast food to fine dining, there's something for everyone in Old Town.  - Art district.  I love walking down the Art district area and window shopping/browsing through all of the art galleries.  That's 1/2 a day right there.  Nighttime - There's not much in terms of nightlife in Phoenix/Scottsdale/Arizona unless you're in Old Town.  - There's a \"Vegas-like\" vibe here.....nothing compares to Vegas, but it's similar enough for me to keep me going until my next trip back.  - It's the only place in the State of Arizona that has any sign of life after 10 pm.  The only complaints I have about Old Town are the parking and the pedicabs.  Parking is hard to find and could cost you $, depending on where you're at.  The Pedicabs are a safety hazard in my opinion and they cut you off and disregard traffic....they're very annoying to me.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Downtown Phoenix, I fear, is not on America's top list of destinations.  However, Scottsdale is an international mecca for those seeking the flavors of the southwest, spas, art galleries, cowboy paraphernelia, and a very exciting night life. Old town is older than most would think...The Hohokam indians trafficked here until 1400 AD., 400 years later an army general named Scott bought acreage here, and the little hamlet blossomed by the early 1900s.  Many of the original buildings can still be seen in old town, including the blacksmith shop on 2nd and brown which is nearly a century old.  In the 1930s, the magnificent and indefatigable Frank Lloyd Wright came here to build Taliesin West, which is a must-see for anyone interested in architecture. In the 1950s Scottsdale officially became a town, and you will notice many of  old town's buildings and eateries retaining the style and decor of that era.  One of those places is the Sugar Bowl, located on Scottsdale Road.  It's a mom and pop soda shop and ice cream parlor, where you can get dozens of flavors of malts and sodas, even peanut butter and jelly sandwhiches. Old towns streets are lined with souvenir shops, Native American jewelry stores, and many enchanting art galleries.  For those particularly intersted in the arts, coming to old town on a Thursday evening is worth it.  The art walk has local galleries opening its doors to pedestrians, some serving canapes and wine, some featuring the music of local artists.  Tucked inbetween the galleries you will find wonderful restaurants, bars, pubs and eateries.  My favorite restaurant, Malees, of which I already wrote an extensive review. If Thai is not suitable to you, try Ra for sushi, or Bandera's across the street for their amazing rotisserie chicken, or venture over to Buca di Beppo for the traditional family style Italian dining.   Further north are a plethora of clubs and bars: Dos Gringos for a taste of Rocky Point during spring spreak, the Upper Deck for sports and live bands, The Comedy Spot for stand up comedy, Next for dancing and swilling, Devil's Martini for southwest meets Martha's Vineyard, Gilligans for the wheel of booze, wheel of fear factor, gold fish racing, or karaoke, Mickey's Hangover for the best happy hour in town, Martini Ranch for more live band entertainment (Sunday nights is Metalhead, the live act in town), Drinx for amazing martinis like the angel food cake, Myst for clubbing like there's no tomorrow, Axis/Radius with its two large dance floors, four bars, and plenty of dancers to entertain, Suede for great dancing and relaxing on the chaise lounges near the fire pit, Pussy Cat Lounge for awesome djs, and a packed bar every time, Crown Room  for dim lights and socializing, American Junkie for feeling like you're in college again, and finally - the polynesian tiki lounge by the name of Drift, with its awesome salt water tank and exciting drink menu. Though this is a comprehensive list, these are just some of the fabulous places that make old town a destination for old and young alike, regardless of interests, and personal pursuits. I love Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Say what you will about this place, but overall, I dig it. I didn't appreciate it when I lived in Scottsdale, but as I have moved farther and farther away, I find myself wanting to go here more and more. There are many good restaurants, nightclubs, bars, hotels, stores, activities, and people watching. I guess it isn't for everyone since a lot of people talk shit and hate this place. I get it rest-of-Phoenix-metro-area, you don't like the people. WHAAAAAH! Shut up.  It's better in Scottsdale than most of the valley. Here are my top choices in Old Town in no particular order:  -Mastro's City Hall -The Lodge -Daily Dose -Civic Center -Scottsdale Stadium -Joe's NY Pizza -The Casablanca Lounge -Grimaldi's Pizza -Rusty Spur -AZ 88 -W -Fashion Square Mall -Culinary Dropout  I could list more, but you have Yelp at your disposal.  Use it! :-)"}
{"text":"Charming place to shop, eat, drink and just walk around and enjoy the day.   I had no problem finding parking because I came later in the afternoon. It's probably a hassle if you get there earlier.   I love little areas like this even though I have already been to countless souvenir shops while driving around the Southwest.  This area stood out because I passed by several beckoning bars that seemed pretty \"happening\" even at 4pm. Charming shopping area and a fun bar scene? I'll take it."}
{"text":"I'm torn about Old Town Scottsdale. I work there, used to live there and have friends there. I'm not remotely rich or fancy and overall, prefer areas like downtown Phoenix. BUT, that doesn't stop me from frequenting OTS a few times a week. I think there are a great variety of awesome places to shop and eat. Good selection of sushi joints and I'm a sucker for a clean Walmart (central phx ones are scary as shit). I also enjoy certain clubs here, but there are definitely a few I refuse to visit. It's often times the people and their attitudes that turn me off.  I dig casual places like El Hefe, Firehouse and The Lodge. I do not dig places like The Mint where I strongly believe everyone is either smashed or on some type of drug, probably both. And on top of that everyone is acting like their fancy as fuck when you know damn well they got their clothes at Buffalo Exchange. I love that store, but I don't pretend to be something I'm not. I'm all like, \"I got these jeans for $12 CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT!?\" I've had numerous men try to flaunt their cash flow to impress me and multiple women act like total bitches for no damn reason. This almost never happens anywhere but OTS. It's both annoying and entertaining. But mostly annoying.  I visit too much to be a hater, I accept it for what it is and know that I can have a great time anywhere I go. It's easy to spot me here because I tend to start massive dance circles all over the club and all over your face."}
{"text":"From jersey shore & Paris Hilton wanna be d-bags to homeless aliens; this place has everything downtown Phoenix can only dream of someday having. Tons of high end shops & eateries; surround by local dives & haunts. It beats the other valley areas hands down! Chandler- Brady Bunch Phoenix - 9 to 5 crowd & sport events, then bums. Glendale- why the f@ck were the stadiums built out there again? Tempe- campus d-bags and BUMS. Mesa- immigrants, pawn shops & used car lots-boring & rednecky Gilbert- great place to if your Mormon or into another cult."}
{"text":"This is such a beautiful place!  I'm a New Yorker, so I never experienced much desert or western culture other than on very few childhood vacations out west.  You will get your fill of all of the above things here in Old Town.  Yes, Old Town is touristy, but it is fun.  We were only in Phoenix for 4 days, but we came here multiple times.  Scottsdale is somewhat artsy and classy without being pretentious.  It was a delight to wander around here and see something so different than what we grew up with.  There is a nice selection of bars and restaurants.  I loved Sugar Bowl for ice cream, it was quaint and old timey.  Nothing beats the SB chocolate malt lined with a topping like marshmallow or caramel.  We were here 3 times on our trip for dessert.  We enjoyed some happy hour margaritas at the Salty Senorita.  The shops were mostly touristy, I didn't buy much, but they were enjoyable to take a peek in.  There are also some art galleries too.  We also found a great western museum near the shops and restaurant.  I would budget three hours to visit if it is your first time.  There is a good amount to do and it is all within walking distance.  I very highly recommend this neighborhood to anyone visiting Phoenix for the first time.  If I ever get back to this city, Old Town is at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Great tourist attraction. feature shops, botquies, night clubs, art museums, Good Luck with finding a place to park. I highly recommend valet.  There is so much history in Old Town. You can find historical museums or take a ride on the trolley. My favorites are all the options to dine at after taking a stroll through all the shops.   Farmers Market on Saturday's with local vendors. That is another great perk about old down many local shops and boutiques with a variety of things to enjoy."}
{"text":"Cure area, but very touristy. Beware of price gouging on trinkets and especially food/drinks."}
{"text":"Nice to see some yahoo driving like a maniac and smoking his cigarette in the \"non-smoking\" limo. I wouldn't rent from these guys on a bet."}
{"text":"For people who want to say they've been out West and see a real Western town, this isn't the place. The fake Western motif here doesn't look like anything but a chintzy shopping area. Scottsdale has the bizarre slogan, \"the Wests most Western town\". Well it isn't, it's like a low level version of Miami without the beaches. This shopping area is an embarrassment. For the real deal, visit small towns in rural areas like Oatman or Bisbee."}
{"text":"It's cute.  Not really my style but cute to walk around and spend a lovely afternoon in Scottsdale.  Lots of interesting restaurants and shops.  3 hours free public parking (!!  --  as someone that lives in LA that is amaze-balls to me).  And a free trolley to get around!  So spend a late morning or early afternoon here."}
{"text":"is a super cute area .. sculpture. parks, .. lots of shops, several bars a restaurants,art galleries.   Yeahh it's for the tourist but hey i'm a tourist so it was alot of fun.  We were just visiting for a few days so I didn't get to go in all the shops and galleries but I hit several and enjoyed it.  lots of turquoise  .. it looked really nice .. lots of fancy inlays and really large pieces. I don't know enough about it to know if it's real or fake .. but it was pretty.. I didn't buy anything but saw several things I was interested in.   this was a very clean safe area to spend the day just wish I'd had a whole day to spend."}
{"text":"I've lived in Old Town for almost 7 years now, and I absolutely LOVE it!  Everything you want, you can find here in Old Town.  Great Food, Shopping, Activities, Places to play, and it's extremely pet friendly.  Plenty of friendly people too!"}
{"text":"We have some friends who are long time AZ residents. When we told them we were going to go check out Old Town Scottsdale, they kind of snickered. When I questioned why this choice of activity was so amusing, they revealed that OTS is a bit of a tourist trap.   They seem to have forgotten that I have lived an hour and a half from Orlando most of my life... I'm immune to tourist trap purchase trance.   What is tourist trap purchase trance you ask? Well, it's when you go to a tourist trap and buy a bunch of useless stuff you don't need. You get home with all your bags of new toys when you finally snap out of the trance and wonder.... What did I just do?   Oh yeah, we've all been there. I was confident I'd be okay though.   We arrived and OTS reminded me of a modernized Old West town... with oodles of shops, some restaurants and a candy store.   I got out of the car and the first thing I saw were the brochure booklets with Maps, a Directory and... a Dining Guide. A sure sign of a tourist trap... the ol' brochure booklet. I'm on to your game Old Town Scottsdale but I'll play along. I took a brochure.   We walked around peeking inside shops, browsing through a few, but never making eye contact for too long. Oh no... never make eye contact for too long or you're sure to get pulled into a buying frenzy. We gave the typical, \"Oh just looking\" response to the shop keeper hook question of, Can I help you find anything? We were doing great. Then came the pipe...  I slipped up in a Native American-y store. I saw this really cool looking pipe. It was shaped like an ax. I held it and my hand started trembling. I had to have it. It had feathers on it. And it was shaped like an ax. It was so cool.  So I bought a pipe... shaped like an ax... with feathers on it. I mean, c'mon, how many times in your life will you say that? I don't even smoke.   My verdict is that Old Town Scottsdale is pretty sweet. Although it's totally a tourist trap, it's also entertaining and a nice place to come walk around. I didn't try any of the restaurants on this trip but look forward to coming back. Next time with a little more will power."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the area and I can't think of anywhere else to go, I end up either wandering here, when the sun is still up, or Mill Avenue in Tempe, once it's set.   This region of Scottsdale is stuffed to the gills with tourists (senior citizens, mostly) and the cheesy gift shops to appease them. Most shops and galleries close in the early-to-mid afternoon, it seems.   Honestly, I don't know why I keep coming back here. It's certainly not an interest in \"people watching,\" as some would say to justify going to such places.   During my most recent trip here, I picked up a 99-cent can of Arizona tea at the back of one shop and spent a good 10 minutes trying to get to the counter, navigating around the spring training-watching snow birds who couldn't hear my shy, yet repeated \"Excuse me\"s.   Most of the shops strive for this one-stop Old West/Mexican culture/Western wear atmosphere. Here's where you can buy \"authentic\" Native American arrows, cactus-shaped light switch covers, or rusted over door-knockers and hinges for that rustic look on your new McMansion."}
{"text":"Great place to walk around. Tons of great restaurants and tons of shopping.  Thursday night art walks are really fun too. Great date night with dinner."}
{"text":"We had reservations for dinner in Old Town Scottsdale but were early.  We decided to walk around the town.  It is definitely unique and very western.  There are so many things to see and lots of fun shops.  There are a lot of little touches to make the town special from cactus, to carvings to missions and shops.  There's just about something that everyone will find to enjoy.  We will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Lots of art galleries, try going on one of the Art gallery Walk nights on a Thursday. Lots of shops selling southwestern types of things for people visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"Went in for Sunday funday! Bottomless mimosas before two! Can you say awesome? Had an energetic and lovely server jasmine who took care of me and my hubby so well! Will definitely come back for the food service and hospitality!!!"}
{"text":"I give this place a 4 star for the 70+ restaurants and bars. You will always find a decent place to eat.  This place is not a fun place on hotter months but when the weather cools it's enjoyable.   The town has a south western feel with dozens of shops selling jewelry, art work, gifts for friends.   I loved it and recommend if you are a tourist like me to check it out. Yay!!"}
{"text":"Chalk this one up to \"sh*t that was cooler when I was a kid.\"  I think it was cooler mainly because I still believed in Santa Claus or didn't wonder how and why stores would stock all the stuff they do and why American consumers feel so inclined to buy as much stuff as they do...  Took the GF here this weekend and I was disappointed.  We had some good food but the overall Old Town experience was lacking even at the best of the galleries and sh*t shops."}
{"text":"Driver was late and while we were waiting added another person who was also waiting for same sedan service, driver was rude and doubled the charge. We had no choice but to go with them in order to catch our plane. Very rude driver and will never use them again"}
{"text":"tl;dr--This is the natural progression of shopping and nightlife when you're too old to dress like/sleep with ASU undergrads on Mill. It's the poor man's Los Angeles with a wild wild west flair. It's where you go to flex (that means show off), and the hotspot for the most extravagant nightlife you'll find in the state. Have fun."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lots to do for everyone. Families can come for a nice afternoon meal, a nice stroll around the park or in the souvenir shops, or if you're lucky you'll run into some event they're having at the park. We went on a random Sunday afternoon and saw an Italian festival and another event with live music so it seems like there's always something to do.  There are lots of souvenir shops but a lot of them were jewelry shops, which was a little interesting to me. Whether you're a tourist or not, there are a lot of shops where you can find good items for gifts.  This place gives off a small town/wild west type feel with the way the buildings are designed. However, you can tell there's a modern twist with all the bars and restaurants.  If you're looking for a nice picture to take, there's a sign that says \"Welcome to Old Town Scottsdale\" with a giant cowboy that was perfect!"}
{"text":"If you want one tourist shop after another, on one side, and art galleries on the other side of main street, this is the place to go.  It really is just for tourists.  I cannot imagine why any local would ever go here."}
{"text":"Even though I was a tourist in Scottsdale, this place built for tourists made this tourist want to run the other direction.  There were some interesting stores that sold nick nacks and then some high end art galleries in this shopping district. I don't think the area knows what exactly it wants to be.  I was really bored and wanted to leave as soon as possible.  My host had only been here twice since they had recently moved to the area but she even admitted this would be a place that she wouldn't mind missing the next time guests came to stay."}
{"text":"Try walkscore.com for 85251 (Old Town Scottsdale) and compare it to where you now live... you might just be amazed...   *Here is a direct link to Old Town's score: http://www.walkscore.com/get-score.php?street=85251&go=Go"}
{"text":"I really try to like Old Town Scottsdale - and if you look past all the God-Awful tourist traps it is actually quite a nice place with a number of top notch dining options - but in the end you can only walk by so many mass-produced \"native\" jewelry shops with \"Bargains\" before it all starts blending together.  Parking is generally a travesty but can be found if you're willing to wait it out and the public art is a nice touch.  For my dollar - go, grab a spot, and kill some time at Cartel, grab some local foods at Bodega, and maybe consider a bite at one of the locally owned restaurants like FnB or Praying Monk, and skip any place with turquoise jewelry in the window while focusing on the galleries that don't quite seem to fit the 'theme.'"}
{"text":"In one word: overrated. In many words...  It's a tourist trap. It's a plastic version of the Old West. It is one of the few places in the Valley in which you can go bar-hopping... but like anywhere else in this swollen suburb you still have to drive to get there. And on that note, don't bet on light rail service reaching this area anytime soon. The mayor argued a light rail line running through Old Town would ruin the look of the area. Forget the fact that two streets-- one to the east and one to the west-- branch off from Scottsdale Road, run alongside Old Town, then merge back to the main drag, they say it will spoil the look. I guess asphalt roads, traffic lights and a parking garage in the middle of the city were staples in late-19th Century Western towns though. But, I digress. It has amenities and street life Downtown Phoenix can't seem to attract, but most cater to tourists. Like pretty much everywhere else in the Valley, you'll be hard-pressed to find unique street life and quirky, bohemian elements of it. Scottsdale Fashion Square is nearby, as it wouldn't flourish anywhere else in the Valley without out-of-town money flowing in, thanks to an abundance of low-paying jobs in the Phoenix area.   A favorite haunt of 20K-millionaires and tourists, Old Town is a hilariously false representation of metro Phoenix. About as authentic to the Old West as Howdy Doody, if you're out for a pioneer-days pastiche you'll find it here."}
{"text":"Loved coming here and looking at all the window displays. Fun area to take out of towners Tourists beware though. It's fun looking at western regalia but would you really wear that once you're home?"}
{"text":"I love strolling Old Town, during the day and after dark. This is truly an eclectic place for kitschy gifts and great food options. I often bring guests here so we can walk around on a nice afternoon or just take in the beauty of the fountains at the Scottsdale park (walking distance from the Saguaro). Be sure to come here after dark to hit the bars for dancing and drinking, you won't be disappointed...unless you go to HI-FI (read my review on them). The bars have a great clubbing atmosphere on the weekend nights, just be sure to dress a little nicer than jeans."}
{"text":"So this place looks cool from the outside its a lot of walking, so I'm the summer drive around and find the places you want.  It's toooo hot to walk around there in this summer heat almost no place here has spritzers outside to fool you   Definitely looks like and old western town, all it needed was horses, tumbleweeds and gun slingers.   Cool restaurants and art gallery's.  Several cheesy stores and some bars.  Friday's they have the art walk were bars and restaurants and art galleries are open late and cool."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to the Old Town Scottsdale (OTS) area. There's a certain charm about it that I haven't ever experienced in another Downtown area before--from the really cool Western look of the stores; great public art; wonderful landscaping; friendly people; and just a great all-around vibe. Besides all the great little shops, restaurants, art galleries, and museums to check out, there are also tons of seasonal events; I'd highly recommend checking the Downtown Scottsdale website before you visit to make sure you don't miss out on anything really cool (http://www.scottsdaledowntown.com/Events.aspx?Paging=1). Here's a quick list of some of my highlights (in no particular order):  Shops/Restaurants:   1) Scottsdale Historical Museum- Pretty cool, little piece of Scottsdale history. The Museum is housed in the original schoolhouse and the whole thing can be seen in 5-10minutes.   2) Bischoff's Shades of the West- Great little touristy store that's packed full of Southwestern memorabilia and souvenirs. This a must-stop for any true Pepper Head; they have a fantastic collection of salsa, hot sauce, spicy jellies, and every other kind of spicy food you could imagine--and even some you can't!   3) Bootleggers- Very good BBQ spot that's worth checking out if you're in the mood for some Q.  Events:  Native Trails- I was fortunate enough to be able to catch the Native Trails show when I was last in OTS. It's an hour and a half production that features Native American Dancers, Singers and Musicians. It's pretty great, goes by really fast, and has you wanting more by the end. All the performers are terrific and there's a nice amount of humor thrown in there for good measure. The event runs every Thursday and Saturday from the January to the first week of April--and the best part is it's free! Don't forget to grab some Indian Frybread while you're there; it's terrific!  If you're ever in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area during Spring Break or any other time of year I highly recommend making your way to OTS. It's a definite tourist trap, but it's the best damn tourist trap I've encountered. There's also plenty of parking and it's free! Do you hear that Bay Area?! Free Parking! Sorry, I hate paying for parking, but I digress. OTS is a lot of fun and there's lots to see and do and I look forward to visiting when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place is very similar to Carmel by the Sea in California. This particular part of Scottsdale is filled with tons of art galleries in a very small vicinity. Within a walk of the Valley Ho where some friends were staying we walked down through this area while on the way to the Farmer's Market and then looked at the different stores on the way back. We saw some beautiful art work from Russian and Japanese artists/ themed to glass blown pieces. A good way to start your vacation."}
{"text":"I love this area. It's forever popping. Its patrons range from the rowdy college students to the posh art enthusiast, and there are businesses which cater to this spectrum.   Hungry? There are lots of eateries from which you can choose: sushi, Mexican, Mediterranean, American, sit down, take-out, fancy-schmancy, casual, etc., and there is something for every budget. There's even an old school ice cream shop and a candy shop for the strike of the sweet tooth.   Got drank? (For you lushes...) Bars by the dozen, for your libation merriment.   Later, you can walk off those calories by strolling through the corridors of Old Town. And more than likely, those boots really weren't made for walking, so bring comfortable walking shoes because there is lots of territory to cover, as it spans both the east and west sides of Scottsdale Rd, from south of Indian School to Camelback.   Tourist? Tons of shops selling Native American jewelry, art, accessories, etc. Some shops are pricier than others, so if you have the time, shop around.  There are also lots of souvenir shops for your t-shirt, postcard, magnet, shot glass, etc., gift-giving desires. Unique souvenirs are also to be found. I found a cool knife with a wolf embedded into both the blade and the handle.   Are you a collector? There are shops that carry rare and hard to find collector's items (dolls, figurines, art/ paintings/ sculptures, etc.).  Shopping for fashion? There's everything from couture to hippie.   With salons, tattoo parlors, an angel store, western shops, art galleries, flag store, girly stores and manly stores, etc., and a church, you can satisfy the beauty and tame the beast.   Family-friendly during the day. Grown & sexy at night. An array of eclectic shops that you won't find at the mall. Hints of old Wild West are throughout. You can easily spend half of a day wondering around these parts (which is why I typically only hangout here during cooler months), so plan accordingly.  During the day, parking isn't too bad, but at night it can be trying. There are free public parking lots, just look for the signs. Public restrooms are plenty. Credit cards are widely accepted but there are bank ATMs around the main road (Scottsdale Rd) if cash is needed.   Whether you're a tourist or resident, young or old, cultured or heathen, there is something for you in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Nice place to watch the game and have a brew. Hear it can get douchey but I was there during bowl week and it was fine"}
{"text":"Old Town Scottsdale is a lively city in the middle of the dessert. It is perfect for enjoying yourself with great food and drinks after a day of outdoor activities taking advantage of Arizona nature (horseback riding, rock climbing, hiking, etc.). As a foodie, I enjoyed walking around and seeing a variety of restaurant (definitely try The Mission!) Everything is walking distance so after a meal you can stop by some bars in the area. There is also a large shopping mall with chain stores as well as boutique stores to get some unique Scottsdale-only items!  TIP: Some hotels in the Scottsdale area offer free transportation to and from Scottsdale (make sure you inquire!)."}
{"text":"This whole scene turned ghetto in the past decade:  http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2011/10/scottsdale_chick_fight_caught.php"}
{"text":"I'll agree that there are many stores here for sure, but not many of substance.  As far as the going out at night, it seems like a bar scene over the club scene, so it's set up well for the tourists.  I have to say that the galleries are a nice addition to the scene."}
{"text":"If you want to see the most touristy part of metro Phoenix go here to Old Town Scottsdale.  This is a place that is jammed packed with shops, restaurants, clubs, and whatever you want.  It is also a good area to go walking and people watch."}
{"text":"We wandered over here after a Rockies game when we were looking for something to do.   It was a great little Western area stuck in the middle of town. All the storefronts look straight from the old movies and it was a very cool little vibe. There's a ton of crap shops around where you can buy shot glasses, tshirts and any local made in China stuff you want. We even passed a guy dressed like John Wayne who was just a touch creepy.  Ample parking, which was nice."}
{"text":"This shopping area was filled with small Indian/cowboy themed ':shops'. If that is your scene, you would love this area.  Not our personal style. We walked past the windows and took a picture in front of the last he cowboy sign welcoming you into the area. After that we were about done. There were a lot of restaurants and bars that looked very promising."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Old Town Scottsdale. Tons of great shopping restaurants bars and an overall fun vibe to the area. Kind of as a clash between old west charm and new modern La Style. Definitely worth checking out if you're in from out of town. Plus during baseball season the Giants play right here. You can hit the game go to some great restaurants bars and hotels."}
{"text":"Old Western meets art galleries, Native American arts and crafts, fine dining and hot club night spots...Get your souvenirs and turquoise jewelry then grab lunch and mingle with the locals- use the trolley on those hot summer days- and dont forget to wear your SPF 60 and hat ;-)"}
{"text":"Great place to spend an evening! Tons of bars, places to eat, places to shop, and even a few dessert spots! The Sugar Bowl is a must stop, so good! Classic ice cream parlor. Also, the Giants spring training stadium is close by."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I thought it reminded me of the area around the Town Square in Prescott. You know, lots of tourist shops and buildings with \"Old West\" facades. Plus some cool bronze statues of cowboys. And a nice fountain. Wait, is there a fountain in Prescott? I can't remember. Anyway, I am off topic here. The point is, Old Town Scottsdale has all the Southwest charm of any small town tourist spot in AZ but on top of that some of the best high-end shopping and dining of anywhere in Phoenix but without the snooty \"real housewives\" vibe you get in North Scottsdale. It is a great place to hang out any day of the week and especially for out of town visitors. Be aware that the late night crowd on Fridays and Saturdays consists mostly of ASU students looking to get drunk and/or hook up. But a little earlier in the evening you have a wonderful dinner and take a nice stroll along the canal. Some of my favorite spots are Herb Box, 5th and Wine and The Gelato Spot. But new places are popping up all the time including new branches of hot spots from other parts of the valley like Hulas and Cornish Pasty Co. And with all this popularity you would think there would be a parking shortage or at least high prices but no, street parking is free even though most have a limit of 3 hours (and yes, the cops do check and issue tickets!). Your best bet is to park in one of the free garages scattered around. Most of them are underground (so as not to ruin the lovely street level ambiance). And if you want to visit multiple locations without a lot of walking, you can always jump on the trolley and they sometimes have Pedi cabs during peak tourist season. Much easier than dealing with the parking hassles of Mill Ave or downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I am only going to focus on Old Town as a dining and bar destination. It is many more things; boutique shops, art galleries, high end hotels, restaurants and even some multi family housing. It also includes the most high end mall in the state, Scottsdale Fashion Square.  Old Town is the nightlife center of the Valley of the Sun. I think this was best demonstrated when the Super Bowl was in town. The game may have been played in Glendale, but the celebrity parties were in Scottsdale. Over the past several years I have seen various celebrities out at the clubs in Old Town. I have seen our hometown celeb, David Spade, out over holiday weekends like Easter and Thanksgiving out in Old Town. Other celebs I've spotted out over the years are Charles Barkley, Steve Nash, Amare Stoudemire, Mike Tyson, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Kendra Wilkinson , the Kardashians, Dennis Rodman and Frankie Muniz (now living in the Valley.)   In March, during the Cactus League Spring Training, the bars are filled with groups of mostly guys that are in town to watch their fave teams play during the day and hit Old Town clubs and bars at night. You will also run into the occasional player or team scout.  The dining options are a mix of local and chain restaurants. The original PF Changs was actually located in Fashion Square Mall."}
{"text":"Nov. 25, 2016 I had a lovely time walking around Old Town Scottsdale, they had a lot of nice shops and plenty of restaurants to choose from. There is a lot of art work to look at and take pictures. This place was very clean and everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"A nice place to walk around and go into shops. The only thing is there are way too many jewelry stores. I would go back!"}
{"text":"Cool place.  Tons of shops, art and  entertainment.   You get everything you are desiring in a very small area.  I love old town for that reason.  It's where \"hip\" young adults want to go when they are done with the Tempe style night life.  This is where young adults with a lot of snootiness go.  And then, there are the commoners like myself who go here for a good meal from time to time and the occasional night of dancing and excitement that makes up a night on the town in Old Town!    My favorite Old town spots are FNB http://www.yelp.com/biz/fnb-scottsdale#hrid:4rcXAsUdD2iha-eMQBv0yA, Citizen's Public House http://www.yelp.com/biz/citizen-public-house-scottsdale#hrid:_owXWzQUkjY1KnIL8sG6VA and  Pig and Pickle(is this really old town?) http://www.yelp.com/biz/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale#query:Pig%20and%20Pickle to name a few.  These are places I go for the late night (or any time) vah-vah-vah-vooooooom shake it down swizzle-me .... TIMBER ------at the end of a night of dancing and walking around in ridiculous 5 inch heels with the tightest dress known to mankind.  Yes, old town is a place for fun for all ages, but I'll be honest, I'm not there for the art walk http://www.yelp.com/biz/scottsdale-art-walk-scottsdale, I'm not there for the fabulous Mall http://www.yelp.com/biz/scottsdale-fashion-square-scottsdale-2#query:Fashion%20square ---- OK ok, you got me on that one, I go there for the mall.  but I'm not there for the Ollie Trolly http://www.yelp.com/biz/dunn-transportation-ollie-the-trolley-tempe#query:trolly.... Honestly, I'm there for the drinks, the food, the beautiful people and the vah-voooooooom baby.    Go there.. have fun...Yelp about it, like me.  Have fun!  See art!  Go drinking!  Also, don't forget to Thank the almighty for your DD.    Yea!"}
{"text":"Makes sense that the majority of the cactus are fake since this is a tourist area and last thing the city needs is a lawsuit. Definitely lots of unique looking shops, seems mostly like mom and pops. If the weather permits walking, definitely get the chance to browse around.  Pull cameras out and get ready for snapping like a true tourist. Civic Center (yup where the big ass \"love\" sign) is on the east side."}
