{"text":"Food was fantastic and the owner/chef Jim, was even better. I ordered a panini that had meat but without the meat (I'm a vegetarian) and Jim was so set on making sure I would get something I liked. He pretty much made me a special made sandwich and it was SO good. I told him he should add it to the menu! Myself and the two friends I came in with were the only ones there so we shared great conversation with Jim. Super nice guy! Even let us snag a pic with him."}
{"text":"I guess this could be called a post humous review, as they have closed down, and have been taken over by a specialty pizza place 

I probably at here a couple dozen times, the number one thing that brought me back was the incredibly nice and friendly owner, Jim. Finding someone like this running a business, getting his hands dirty and chatting up his clientele is a rarity, but something I fully understand, being self employed myself. 

I can go on about the food, but it's a pretty moot point at this point as you can no longer enjoy the meals, but I mostly grabbed sandwiches (veal, meatball, chicken, sausage) but even indulged in the pastas as well as the  pizza many times. Great prices and great flavour. Coupled in with Pop Shop soda in the fridge rekindling childhood memories. 

I was sad to see what looked like a midnight move took place, but I know they were not the busiest, and sometimes life happens. Bummed me out though as there were not a lot of well priced great eats in the area, and it is an area I would frequent.

So why bother writing, well if Jim ever sees this, it will serve as a reminder that he was appreciated, and he did have a decent restaurant."}
{"text":"I never met a meal here that I didn't like! I'm vegetarian, so I cannot comment on the meat dishes, but the eggplant lasagne here is to die for! The menu here is vast. Definitely something for everyone. Numerous pasta dishes, of the usual variety, and so many more I had never heard of. The secret is in the sauce, I think. Always leaves me wanting more. They sell slices here too, which are great, but often not ready when I drop in impromptu. No worries, though, as they always make me up a special personal pizza fresh on the spot and charge me for only the slice or 2 I would have grabbed. Currently salivating just thinking about all the italian goodness as it is 11:40am right now and they open at noon! Almost time to head on over... see you there?"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on their lasanga special day and can't say I was disappointed. Good service from the owner, who asked when he saw me on the street later that day how my meal was. There is a spicy oil sauce he puts on top of the lasagna that gives it a bit of a slow burn, as he said. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Came in here with a group of people for their anniversary and the place was great, despite limited seating we were greeted and served within 15 min to a fresh large pie and some pasta. Seating is a bit tight here with about 14 seats, but most get food to go so it's not too much of an issue. 

Don't let the small storefront fool you, this place has an incredible menu ranging from pasta, pizza, cutlets, meatballs and some other old time Italian classics. With expanded hours and more menu choices this place can definitely do well in this high traffic venue."}
