{"text":"My husband and I love Emilano's in the Southside, but this location is terrible. We arrived around 7:30 p.m. on a Monday. They weren't busy, but it took 10 minutes to even be greeted by a server at our table. After he finally came over we ordered beers and then never saw our server again. After waiting another 10 minutes we decided to move to the bar to receive faster service. The bartender and the manager didn't care at all. No one was friendly or helpful. The beers we ordered were sitting on the bar when we sat down. We ended up just drinking them and then leaving. We both have worked in the service industry for more than 10 years and we are very forgiving when it comes to slow service, but no one at this restaurant cared about service at all. We will never be back."}
{"text":"It's... not bad here. Honestly the food is pretty good, not the best Mexican food but certainly not the worst. Their chimichanga dish in particular is great, but they stopped serving it with beans for whatever reason. Any other Mexican restaurant you go to will serve it with rice and beans, but that's just a small complaint. Really what they lost stars on is service. It's certainly quick, but almost too much so... to the point where it actually feels like they're pushing you out the door. I had met with a college friend for dinner here once, intending to catch up, we had finished our meals, paid the tab, left a generous tip (which the server picked up while we were still seated, which having been a waitress myself seems a bit of a faux pas unless your shift is ending or the restaurant is about to close for the night) but we were still finishing our alcoholic beverages. He then came back to the table, asked if we wanted anything else, then after we said we were fine, said \"Okay, because other people are waiting to be seated.\" We hadn't even been there an hour. Having been a waitress, I understand most of your income will come from tips, but we ripped generously and regardless, you don't speak to a table like that. If I wanted to eat and leave in 10 minutes I would have gone out for fast food. On a separate occasion I paid in cash, expecting change, and watched as my server walked out the door for the end of his shift, never to return... basically taking a 50% tip. To be fair, I have complained to the company about their service and they do get back to you/ sometimes offer a gift card or something but if they send me one anymore I just give them away. I have no intention to return here when there are other Mexican restaurants with better food and friendlier service."}
{"text":"Showed up 10 minutes before reservation to be told there was a two hour wait! They didn't lose my reservation, they just didn't care that I had one."}
{"text":"Food was very good for a chain restaurant. Service was excellent. I recommend the California burrito carne asada. Excellent. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Pittsburgh! The service is amazing too. They great you at the door and welcome you and check on you frequently to make sure your meal is ok.  Food always comes fast and is great! My favorite is the chicken chimmichangas (sp?)"}
{"text":"Horrible host/seating experience. Complete incompetence. Waited ten minutes for a table. Was given a buzzer. There was no one else waiting, and there were plenty of open tables. This was around 8pm on a Friday night. After the unnecessary wait, we were seated at a freezing cold table next to the wait staff station, about 15 extra chairs, and a few kids boosters. Our server was great. She was friendly and attentive. We received our meals, but we had no silverware or napkins. I think this is the host's duty at this place, but I would hope that our server would have noticed. Ordered the carne asada. Food was fine, but the side of refried beans was warm at best. They were actually cold after a few bites, but I honestly couldn't tell if that was due to our table location cooling them down. Regardless, the food was overall satisfactory except the temp on the beans. Host/seating issue really ruined our experience. Decent Mexican food. We had a nice server."}
{"text":"Great food, great spirits. A little pricey, but a great place to go! Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant many times, and suffice it to say that on one occasion we had such a questionable piece of meat in one of our dishes that we absolutely refuse to go back.  It was really that revolting."}
{"text":"Jut got back from one of the worst dinners ever. Sat for 10 minutes before the manager took our drink orders. 10 minutes later a waiter took our dinner order. In another 15 minutes or so our order came, but not exactly what we ordered but close enough. Finally got the attention of another waitress to bring our missing food. Our first waiter never came back to check on us or refill our drinks. I decided to ask the manager for our bill. I explained what had happened. He offered to take 30% off of our bill. He calculated and gave me the bill. I paid it then realized that he gave me someone else's bill. He had to credit that charge back, I hope, and bill me for my dinner. He apologized but I never got the impression he even cared and thought the discount was all that was needed. I've eaten in this Resturant many times and the service was fine. This is however the second time in as many months we have had a problem. When they are busy consider going some where else like Grande's Italian across the street."}
{"text":"Overall decent Mexican food that is well seasoned. However, it is inconsistent; the black beans sometimes comes runny or the enchiladas over doused in cheese sauce or the burrito overloaded with very dry rice or the mole a bit dry. The menu, though good, is rather stuck on the basic taco, burrito, enchilada, fajita. The 3 branches of the restaurant offer the same basic food. If this restaurant wants to elevate itself, then the chef could be more imaginative to showcase true Mexican delights such as cabrito and more seafood."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had lunch and the food fantastic.  The waiter polite and knolegable.just a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I ordered the old school chimichanga & it was delicious. It came with a side of rice and a salad. This is my friends favorite restaurant & she insisted on taking me here & I'm so glad she did. Best Mexican food I've had."}
{"text":"Always good service and great food! Enjoy the drink specials! Fish is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a dinner with family and it was really good. We loved the holy guacamole and enchiladas suiza. Tasty salsa and margaritas. Our server, Amanda, took excellent care of us and made sure we had what we needed. Thanks, Amanda!"}
{"text":"Love the food. I have tried several dishes and have been pleased with them all. Delicous drinks and a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We've been at Emiliano's 7 or 8 times, and I've been impressed by how consistently good the food and service are. We usually start with a big bowl of guacamole made fresh at tableside. I like the enchiladas Cancun with mole sauce but just about everything we've tried here has been good to excellent. They've got big goblets of sangria, red or white, and good horchata drinks, which kids like. It's good for families or large parties and they've also got nice long bar with multiple big TV screens for sports fans."}
{"text":"Stopped in after the STEELER game. The place was pretty busy and our waiter was super friendly. We ordered quesadilla for our appetizers they were pretty good . Our meal came out about 5 min later super fast.i always have a great experience here"}
{"text":"Spent 3 + years here giving business bc I didn't want to see it falter. However I came in on a weds night had 3 drinks and got cut off. I am a 40 year old executive that have gave this place and serves 30% tips over the years. I was in no way beligent distrubive or even a bit loud but was cut off?? Go to barrel junction"}
{"text":"I ended up emailing Emiliano's about my family's experience and they were extremely caring and seemed so sincere that we returned to give them another try and it was like night and day.    We went on a busy Saturday night, waited for about 10 minutes,  got a booth, a wonderful friendly server who was very attentive (even for the amount of tables that were there) and our food was phenomenal!   We will definitely return"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food! Haven't been able to find anywhere else that compares. A little pricey but worth it for the quality & large portions. You can also find cheaper items especially on the lunch menu!"}
{"text":"Food is usually great here, my only dislike is the the ground beef has been over the top salty the first two times I've eaten here, the last time I just picked something without ground beef. Prices are excellent and service has been excellent."}
{"text":"Here from our of town. Read all the reviews and the place comes highly recommended. Food was ok but I had a bread tie in my dinner.  Waitress was mortified.  Manager came and was stunned how it got in there. I didn't cause a stink, but did expect my dinner to be comped.  Or at least my drink. Nothing!  Not even the extra sour cream my son ordered.  Ridiculous!!!!  Be careful there."}
{"text":"Julio was our handsome and friendly server for lunch today. From the start, Julio was happy and very pleasant. Very energetic, polite and fun to meet. My husband enjoyed delicious enchiladas suiza and I loved the fajita quesadillas. Thanks for a very pleasurable dining experience. We suspect Julio will receive many positive reviews while his patrons are entered into the Server Appreciation Contest. We LOVE Emiliano's and our beloved Pens. Both are WINNERS!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in the city.  The margaritas are excellent and the BBQ burrito will impress.  The wait staff is friendly and the food is fast for young families."}
{"text":"What happened to Emiliano's? I had never been to this one before but the food quality was not the same and neither were the portions. The supreme enchiladas used to be 5 enchiladas, now it's 4. I'm not a fatty, but it's my favorite dish. Very disappointed. Service was beyond slow for a sat night that wasn't too busy! We won't be back."}
{"text":"First time visit after hearing from people that it was a good Mexican place..I was not impressed. The salsa with chips served upon seating was a jarred salsa and not a tasty one at that. The nacho platter appetizer used canned chicken and was dry and tasteless. There was a lack of freshness and presentation in the food.  We were a party of 6 so a variety of food was ordered.  The furnishings are run down and the chairs were awkward to pull toward the table. The servers were glum and gruff to a point when all the food came out, he barked out the dish name and glared at us til we claimed our meal. *awkward*. I will not be back nor will visit the newest location in McCandless Crossing. I will not recommend it."}
{"text":"November 28 Health Inspection violations: No date marking prepared foods, storing raw ground beef above prepared foods, malfunctioning refrigerator storing all variety of meats. Yum."}
{"text":"Always a fan favorite! Emiliano's has proven to be a place of champs when it comes to being gluten free- they were very willing to change dishes for me. I've gone several times with co-workers for lunch- there is always a table available and service is moderately quick. They always start the table off with chips and salsa - I wish I could buy the salsa to take home because it's just that good. I typically order the California burrito --and I have them substitute the flour tortilla for a corn tortilla. The corn tortillas are much smaller - so it is no longer a handheld burrito due to the size change. I have yet to go for happy hour- but I drive by pretty often and see it getting crowded - looks like a popular place for drinks!"}
{"text":"I have NO IDEA how this is rated 4 stars. I ordered the black bean soup and the vegetarian quesadilla. The soup was about 15 black beans in broth. No taste or flavor other than plain black beans. The quesadilla was made by them taking the fajita vegetables and dumping them into a flour shell. This caused the flour tortilla to be completely soaked in fajita grease and not to mention the grease from the sticky processed cheese (like a canned type of cheese). When you make a quesadilla you are supposed to chop the vegetables small enough that they fit inside the shell. The quesadilla was probably 2 inches high because the vegetables were just laying in this grease filled tortilla. The one star is for the guacamole because it was the only thing that was good."}
{"text":"A solid Mexican eatery. Pleasant wait staff, family oriented, with good food. Not great, a solid B. Hubby had street tacos with their Choripillo which is chicken with chorizo. It was actually quite good. I had arroz con camarones and it was tasty and filling. Seating was immediate at 7 on a Friday night and it was roomy and comfortable. Our waiter was nice enough but a little forgetful. But the ambiance is casual and pleasant. Best thing I had was the house Margarita. Very good!! Price is reasonable too. You shouldn't b disappointed."}
{"text":"Not good at all but hey it's Hampton. The highlight of my meal was actually my server. I dined solo and usually your service is sub-par when they anticipate the tip may not be that large. However, beyond the bland and mushy food, my biggest pet peeve was one of the cooks/servers, idk who he was that brought out my food...but he kept calling me baby...was just inappropriate and it made me feel wildly uncomfortable. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in all of Pittsburgh, HANDS DOWN!  Great staff, food and priced right. This place isn't your typical Mexican restaurant that gives you large quantity's of food. However, the food is fresh and more than you should probably eat."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just crave that bright green guacamole with the best flavor, or a street-style taco with all the fix-ins.  If you're going to Emiliano's, expect something new every time you go. Went today (Father's Day) and the service was absolutely terrible. I swear every time we go, the service gets worse. It's not like they're short staffed.... restaurant is full of waiters and waitresses. We ordered the \"Holy Guacamole\" and it was really late. By the time he was halfway done, the entrees were at the table. Be sure to ask for only one lime, because if you get any more that that, you're getting lime-a-mole. Entrees we're good. I got the Cancun Chimichanga, and it was very good. No complaints with the entrees other than timing. If I were feeling generous, I would have given them three stars, but the service put me in a bad mood."}
{"text":"If I could eat Mexican food every day I would in a heartbeat. I don't know if it's the crispy taco shells, queso cheese, or the rice and beans with whatever flavorful meat on top, but I LOVE Mexican food. So naturally Emilianos has become a favorite place of mine, and it is very conveniently located right behind my office building. True love was meant to be!   I'm usually here for lunch but have gone a few times for dinner with friends. I've never had to wait for a seat and the service is always super fast and friendly. All the servers and managers there are super nice and make for a great time!   Food here is always delicious. I usually will stick to the Arroz con pollo, it's just perfect in every way. Delicious veggies and chicken on top of rice covered in their yummy queso. Um, who doesn't want that?! Their tableside guac is also very good and so super fresh! Chicken chimichanga, fajitas, and toquitos are always equally as scrumptious! Top it off with some chohula sauce and you've got yourself a delicious meal!   One last thing, their tres leches cake is to die for! I usually only order desserts with chocolate but I went for this once and I am so happy I did! It's a delicious moist cake with so much flavor and a neat texture. It's a must try!!   I love you Emilianos, I will never stop coming to you!"}
{"text":"It's consistently good food but not great food.  Great service though.  Have never had a bad experience with a server there.  Just never had anytging there with wow factor for me but it always satisfies a craving for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Had flautas, tamale, enchilada, rice, frijoles and all were delicious. Don't know why a very few people don't like this place but service was fast. One of our favorite local chains closed down and this small chain (3 restaurants) is our new favorite. Haven't had a complaint after about 8 trips here. Great lunch for two $20."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. They make a California burrito that doesn't even have fries in it. Overall, the food is mediocre. I lived in San Diego for 5 years and this food is not even close to being authentic. If you like alright tasting tex mex, this is your place."}
{"text":"This is a can't lose place.  Consistent good food and good service.  Free chips and salsa and strong margaritas...how can you go wrong.  It's not the best I've ever had but it's solid.  I would give this place 3.6 if I could.  It's really not quite a 4."}
{"text":"We like it. Great food that comes quickly and nice service. Their daily dinner specials are a great value."}
{"text":"I have been to this Emiliano's location many times, and have never had a bad experience, whether it be for lunch, dinner, or Happy Hour. We must always hit it at good times because we've always been seated right away, and the service has always been good to great. I think their salsa is really good (for me, having a good salsa at a Mexican restaurant is kind of important). Appetizer-wise, I really enjoyed the Spinach Quesadilla. It was filled with spinach and cheese, and was really very good. We ordered it because we thought hmm, that's different, and were very surprised. I also really like the tableside Guacamole, which is prepared, obviously, at your table, and you can tell them how much of the ingredients you'd like. Usually we say pile everything in! It's delicious, and fresh. I've had the Popeye Pollo, which is chicken covered in cheese and spinach, with your usual Mexican side dishes - very good. I've also had a dish with Shrimp, peppers, onions and a red sauce, and for the life of me, I can't remember the name of it. I've only had it once, and it was very good, the name just escapes me at the moment. My favorite entree out of the three I've had is the California Burrito. I usually get this anytime I go, just because it's so good. Get it either way, with chicken or steak. And the sauce it comes with, I have no idea what it is, as it must be a \"secret\" recipe, but it really kicks the flavor of the burrito up a notch. Go with a friend, one order the steak, one order the chicken, and swap halves so you get the best of both worlds. As for their adult beverages, their Margaritas are crazy good. I had the Cabo-Rita during their Cinco de Mayo celebration, their Happy Hour special Lime Fish Bowl Margarita, and the Black & Yellow Margarita - all very good. Their Long Island Iced Teas, I think, are the best I've had anywhere. As I said at the beginning, I've never had a bad experience here. Everyone is friendly and the food is good and reasonably priced. This has become mine and my husband's new favorite Mexican place, and get here as often as possible."}

{"text":"You know what Pittsburgh really lacks?  Good Mexican food.  Emiliano's is filling this massive void in my life.  When the one near my parent's house closed, I ventured over to the Gibsonia one.  The McKnight staff was MUCH faster, but this Emiliano's is equally good in quality.  Free chips and salsa while you wait for your food!  I LOVE the combo plates.  Two items and two sides is my favorite option!  Burrito, taco, chili con queso, and refried beans, please!  Sometimes I change it up and do the 3 + 1.  It's so nice to get to sample as many options as possible!  If it's your first trip, definitley go with the combo plate!  The fajitas are pretty legit, and I've only ever gotten one thing I didn't like... Some kind of chicken burrito thing.  Hmmm.... it was clearly not notable.   In other news, I really love Emiliano's drinks!  The margaritas and mojitos are good.  Make sure to check out their drink specials!"}
{"text":"This WAS one of my favorite restaurants in Gibsonia. But for the last 6 months to a year it has gotten progressively worse. And tonight was definitely no exception. Our waiter,Greg, was SO RUDE from the moment we got there.  We had to ask for silverware. He just threw my boyfriends salad down. I had to send my food back because AGAIN it was ice cold and he saw I didn't have my plate and never questioned it or checked on us. He had a bad attitude the whole time and seemed like he was too good to be there. I will NEVER be back again because this is the last time i will \"try\" it and pay for a meal that was near inedible. It's such a shame because I was sometimes a weekly customer because I loved it so much and it was right near my house. You would think after being in the news about food temps that they'd step up their game but NOPE! I am so disappointed."}
{"text":"Unlike Joe B (12/22/2011), lets consider the fact that a normal restaurant would have these same wait times and hopefully Emiliano's isn't being compared with the turn around time at Taco Bell. I want my food to take a little bit to cook so I know it wasn't pulled straight out of the microwave and put on my plate. I do understand the frustration with the check mishap though. Our experience was similar with the wait. Very understaffed evening at the restaurant. The moment we sat down, the memories of the wait disappeared. The food is very authentic and flavorful. It brought back memories of our honeymoon in Mexico immediately upon tasting. My fajitas were fantastic. The shrimp combo with chicken and steak was perfectly cooked and the shrimp weren't even tough. Everything was great and I will be back many times. My wife and I have been looking for a new \"spot\" and we LOVE Mexican food so this looks like the spot. I hope the staffing picks up, but the existing staff did what they could under the circumstances and remained friendly all throughout the evening. Gabriel was our waiter and he was about as good as it gets for a waiter!   Thanks Emiliano's!"}
{"text":"Very nice for lunch. Good food, worth another trip! Not to spicy at all, maybe even a little bland. I'm sure they could adjust. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"I had an avocado salad with grilled chicken, hold the tortilla strips, add fajita veggies. They brought a whole plate of fajita veggies which was a surprise. Salad was super tasty! Would order again. Free chips were crunchy and the salsa was flavorful. Met expectations!"}
{"text":"This is a good Mexican chain restaurant locally.    I'm a big fan of their food but it's not \"authentic\" Mexican.   It's better than Mad Mex however without the super-trendy atmosphere.   Nothing better though than the Emiliano's Fajita's and a Corona with Lime."}
{"text":"My family wanted something different and we found it in Gibsonia. I was haven a really good time. We ordered this table side guacamole amazing experience. The meals were good and our service was spot on. My husband had a communication issue but that is what we came for the experience. My margaritas were amazing. My son enjoyed his meal and my husband did too. My family will go back and try something different each time. I had a wonderful family time moment at Emiliano's and I would suggest everyone go and try this establishment. The atmosphere was really cool and the staff outstanding. I was showered with polite and happy people and that makes all the difference. Thanks so much way to go !"}
{"text":"No complaints on the food.  It was delicious.  Took way too long for our order to come from time of ordering though."}
{"text":"horrible service. the wait time was far too long, and nothing had flavor. it was so pricy for the portion size i had gotten. would not go back, super sad."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, and they were very accommodating to my dietary restrictions, which is a big win for me!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch yesterday! Service was great, food was top notch! The server was happy to get me some shrimp fajitas, Even though it wasn't on the lunch menu. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Super fast! This place always has the best service and great food! I have never had. Bad experience at this place and we go quite often. Perfect for kids because you can easily be in and out quickly!"}
{"text":"I am a regular here. We come for lunch during the week since it's so close. They are usually pretty fast so sometimes I even have time to run to store before returning to lunch. For lunch I usually get the create your own combination. I get 3 items and usually take a chicken quesadilla back to the office for lunch the next day. I love their retried beans. They have a lot of flavor and aren't bland like most places. I get a bean tostada, chicken quesadilla and Chile relleno with rice. Everything is super good, always fresh and cooked to order. I don't think I've ever had something here that was so bad I couldn't eat it. I do have favorite items though! The arroz con pollo is one of them. It's rice with peppers, onions, mushrooms, chicken covered in queso blanco and a dollup of sour cream on top. You can also get it with shrimp which are good too. Also love the guacamole they make at your table to your taste. You can get it not spicy if you like or add or take out ingredients. It tastes completely different than what is served with the meals. I highly recommend it! Also Benji is the best waiter there so ask for him! The only reason I gave this place 4 stars is because they continually increase their prices. It is my favorite Mexican place though!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a new restaurant to try, so we decided to try Emilliano's. As soon as we opened the front door three people from the hostess station said \"hola\", apparently that means hello in spanish. They showed us to our table and gave us menu's. Our waiter comes to the table and I could of swore he was speaking spanish too. I could hardly understand anything he said. My wife works in a hospital and she is used to talking to all the foreign doctors, so she had to help me order and communicate with him. It didn't make me feel very welcome. I was a minority in this restaurant. With all of that being said, the food was good but a little overpriced for the area. I just think they take the mexican theme too far for this redneck."}
{"text":"When I'm in town my family always takes me here. Living in San Diego it's hard to find somewhere in Pittsburgh that can replicate authentic Mexican food but this place does the job! I order my usual Chicken Fajitas and cannot complain. They come out sizzling, with a side of soft tortillas, and all the fixings. One thing I have come to love is Horchata so when I saw Horchatini (Horchata Martini) on the menu, naturally, I had to order it! It was SO good. Like, I gulped it down within 3 sips lol.  See you in a year or so Emiliano's!"}
{"text":"when I think about Emiliano's my mouth starts uncontrollably drooling. sometimes not even bc of the food but because of that dime piece hostess Hannah!!!!! guacamole is a solid 14/10. fajitas make me dance like I'm at a Mexican fiesta. tbh next time I go I'm wearing a sombrero then taking a siesta!!! ;)"}
{"text":"For a strip mall in suburbia, it's just OK. My mole was too sweet & the guacamole was bland, but the service was solid."}
{"text":"This location was definitely not as enjoyable or tasty as the South Side location. The restaurant is a bit rundown; and, service was slow. The food was okay - even though a number of things were wrong with our various orders - but I'd rather go to South Side any day."}
{"text":"This restaurant has authentic food. It's tasty and the service has been great every time I've been there.  They always accommodate large groups. Good food, happy hour, and a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"This restaurant may be great - I've never eaten there even though I could walk from my house.  This isn't about their restaurants, per se, but about their corporation.  Today I received another e-mail from them about buying gift cards as presents.  I received periodic e-mail from them about other promotions such as Cinco de Mayo, Mother's Day, etc.  But the one e-mail I've been expecting for about 20 months has yet to reach me.    Not long after moving here & shopping in a nearby grocery store, I saw a sign on the restaurant window to register with them for a \"free entree' on your birthday\", so I did a few months before my birthday.  Since then, my birthday came & went, both in '16 & '17.  So that notification missed me, but these other messages somehow flow to my InBox.  Funny why that is.  I can only surmise that it's a scam to capture e-mail addresses for their promotions & they have no intent of offering a free birthday entree'.  So, since that's how I was introduced to Emilianos, I'll just wait until they comply with their end of the bargain.   If they can't believed about honoring an offer they make on their front window, then how can I believe that anything I might order is what it purports to be.  Untrustworthy on one thing is a sign they may be the same way on anything else."}
{"text":"This place has the best service, biggest burritos, and best specials for drinks! I would suggest this place to any Mexican food lover, heck any food lover, who is craving a big cheesy bite of heaven. The service is great and I can safely say they will be getting my business more often!"}
{"text":"Serious right now. I'm at the new McKnight location. Wait for food was 30 min after we order. I got veggie fajitas, had a piece of chicken in it. Waiter didn't bring silverware for about 5 minutes after we asked and food was served. Manager only took my meal off the check. Waited ten minutes for check. I'm not fudging times either. If they are getting chicken in the before dishes what does that say about the rest of their food prep. I'm livid. I never complain, I worked restaurant  industry for ten years. Pffft this place."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Mexican food, this is the place to go. The food is excellent and the atmosphere is nice. You can't go wrong with their burritos or quesadillas."}
{"text":"Had a large party there for Mothers Day.  Had a wait and found place half empty.  They stated they had people call off and very short staff. Waiter seemed stressed and service was terrible.  Had to wait for everything , had to ask for silverware , napkins, and asked for water 6 times.   There was no manager on duty, no one in charge, just a few young kids trying to run the place.  Waited an hour for food, and 1/2 the meals were dried out. Even the fajitas were not very good, the refried beans looked like a ladle of slop from a can.  Waiter brought two deserts to share and told us to use spoons to share , when we asked for extra plates.  The waiter was sarcastic and poor service, but perhaps due to being under so much stress.  He mentioned several times everyone called off.  Total time there was over 2 hours.  The worst part is 5 of 7 of us became ill that night.  4 had terrible diarrhea and one had diarrhea and vomiting. We have a call into them now, they said they will get back to us.  I give this place no more than a year and they will be closed."}
{"text":"Good food, fair prices, great wait staff.  The food comes out quickly making it great for family meals.   Lot of televisions to watch the game."}
