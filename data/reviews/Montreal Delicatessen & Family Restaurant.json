{"text":"Great casual place to eat. The best smoked meat and I love their breakfast!"}
{"text":"LOVE IT!  The was a spur of the moment decision considering the bad experience we had at another restaurant prior to ending up here.  Really liked this place and will go back.  There's even an out door patio.  My friends ordered the pizza.  I had a taste of it and was totally blown away.  Talk about amazing full of taste and no lack of meat and cheese.  I had a club sandwich which was also great.  Another friend had roast beef on a kaiser and there as so much roast beef you couldn't put your mouth around the bun.    Great food for your money and well worth another trip to try other items on there menu!!!"}
{"text":"For quick and casual dining, for us this has been Mississauga's most dependable and consistent restaurant since the mid-seventies. We were pleased to see they have just added a large deck and rejuvenated the interior since our last visit.   As an early member of the FLQ (Fellows Leaving Quebec), I  usually have one of their very satisfying Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwiches which comes in 2 sizes, the regular (large) and Super (colossal). The meat seems to have lost some of it's spiciness over the years and it is now machine sliced instead of by hand in the old Montreal tradition. However, it is still a superior product and evokes nostalgic feelings that only former Montrealers will understand.   My usual side dishes here are equally satisfying. From the golden-crisp steak-cut fries with a creamy soft interior, to the sour kosher dills and the always-fresh, crisp and spicy Cole Slaw. All seldom as good anywhere else.   Service here is quick and business-like, thankfully without those overly cheery greetings, introductions, and annoying congratulations on being able to place an order usually encountered in the local chain restaurants.   Will you ever see this place on FoodTV's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives? Probably not. So you're going to have to try it yourself. You may even become regulars like us. Happy eating."}
{"text":"Handled the abundance of customers very well. Quick service. Good choice of breakfast foods. Staff seem happy. Price was decent as well"}
{"text":"Great food and fast service! We ordered the roast beef and old fashioned meat sandwich! The  #soooogoood!"}
{"text":"If you want cheap bang for your buck this is the place to eat. I don't say dine and lets leave it at that. So 2 stars here are for the cheese cakes and the breakfast. Big portions for both and great prices. I love dessert by the way. LOVE it. Though they're not made here whoever puts these babies (the cheesecakes) together does it right.  As for the breaki, the omelets are huge and ingredients fresh. I'd stick to these items from the menu though to keep it at 2 stars. This is a very casual diner-like atmosphere where the waitresses may treat you like an old friend, or a pain in their ass."}
{"text":"Simply put, this place is amazing. I have been coming here with daddy-kins since I was a little girl and have never ever had a bad meal or service. Most recent trip in on Sunday morning I tried something new, the ham and cheese on french toast. wow. so good. lots of swiss cheese and fresh sliced ham on perfectly cooked french toast. I also really like the bagel with smoked salmon. They do good smoked salmon here. The smoked meat sandwiches are also just as good as everyone raves about, always fresh and never greasy or overly salty. Add to all this the lovely servers and friendly owner and that is why this place gets 5 stars."}
{"text":"Well worth the trip. We were staying out by the airport and I had a craving for a Ruben.  Came across this place and was not disappointed at all. The food is awesome and it's very affordable.  Would recommend this place to friends and family, so I guess you guys are my Yelp friends..Good Eats to all."}
{"text":"This restaurant is an amazing surprise! We walked in, greeted with friendly service and immediately was asked of we wanted coffee as we were being seated! Great place!"}
{"text":"Up from NYC for Caribana and craved a NY style deli, and found it!! Great place if you want true, good, old fashioned deli style sandwiches. We had the Super Old Fashion, Turkey Club and Reuben, each as good as the other. Found my NYC deli away from home!"}
{"text":"My Montreal buddies all about smoked meats and poutine,  Since in town many times a month had to try out....glad I did. Asked Waitress about Reuben or smoked meat, she said Reuben for sure that day.. still stuffed. tender and great taste.. had fries and coleslaw. My issue is I gained too much weight! I will go back on way to airport but might split sandwich next time."}
{"text":"Pretty bad place. The fries where horrid, done in super old oil where your fries come dark and you can taste the oil. The coleslaw was ok, but was very watery. I got the roast beef, but to be honest it tasted like pastrami and was super salty. He wasn't very generous with the mustard, had to ask for more."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try to go out for some montreal smoked meat for our datenight.  It was very good.  Nice moist meat stacked high with a little mustard on rye bread.  The fries reminded me of mcdonalds fries but cut much thicker which i loved and so did my wife.  The only thing i didnt enjoy was the pickle.  I was expecting something crunchier."}
{"text":"Just here yesterday, nothing but praise for excellent food at a great price! Portions are above average, and the best smoked meat and ham combination I have ever had."}
{"text":"Ate at the counter (old-school  style) establishment. Large portions and excellent service headlined by smoked meats. Quick bite before a family engagement on  Saturday afternoon and they had is in and out in 45 minutes at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"I was expecting a steamed and moist smoked meat sandwich but got a very average quality meat in my smoked meat sandwich.    Fries were thick cut deli style and were very good.  I would recommend Peters on Eglinton for a far superior smoked meat sandwich and would not come here again."}
{"text":"Been coming here for the past 10 years for my smoked meat fix.  The meat is very tasty and they are very generous with the portions.  I suggest getting a \"Super\" sandwich which comes with fries, coleslaw and pickle.  If you can't finish it just box it up and save it for later.  I usually go for the Super old fashioned or a Reuben.  They really pile on the meat in these sandwiches!  I prefer my meat sliced thicker with a bit more fat...but the thinner, leaner meat here still tastes good and is tender.  Adding hot mustard is a must.  FYI The takeout menu is cheaper than the dine in menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches, though the fries were lacking. Pastrami and smoked meat were full of flavour and not greasy. Bread was fresh and soft, mustard and pickle were on point."}
{"text":"I love to come here for lunch, the portions are very generous! Delicous Smoked meat sandwiches, I cant say comparable to the real deal at Shwarts in Montreal of course, but this place comes close. I always get one of their sandwiches, but their spaghetti is great too. Cherry Coke? Hells yes baby. Oh, and fantastic service too!"}
{"text":"Hubby had hankering for smoked meat.  I tried the house specialty chicken souvlaki.  Service fast and friendly.  Place is quiet at 7pm.    The super smoked meat (yes that's the name!) was a ginormous sandwich with generous slaw and a pickle wedge.  Smoked meat was really good.     Chicken souvlaki came with a generous starter Greek salad and fries and rice and tzatziki.    I would come back for the smoked meat, definitely."}
{"text":"I had a sandwich here more than 14 years ago and I have been thinking about it ever since.  I came back today hoping to find that mystical sandwich not sure exactly what kind it was.    The decor and ambiance is an old fashion homey feeling.  It feels like the kitchens of my childhood. The servers are very sweet and add to the home like atmosphere.    The food comes out promptly.  And the portions are huge!  The corned beef was bursting out between the bread.  It was awesome,  and so were the sides of fries, and coleslaw.    The apple pie is awesome too! Again it feels like old fashioned apple pie A LA mode.  It was the proper portion and plenty of ice cream.  It wasn't overly sweet or too big like the diabetes inducing portions at Demetries.    I don't think the sandwich I tried so long ago was the corner beef so I will be back to try them all!"}
{"text":"It has been over a decade I'm pretty sure since I've been to this place.  It's been so long I honestly didn't even remember what the building looked like on the inside or out.  The place has a real 80's-90's feel to it.  It's really not easy to explain.  It almost feels like I went back in time coming here even though I didn't really have a good recollection of ever being here, I have been here a good number of times.  The inside sort of looks like it's been around for a while, not to say it's not clean or worn down but rather it just has a nostalgic feel to it, kind of how I felt going into La Belle Province in Montreal for the first time.    Anyway the menus looked like they haven't been changed in a while either.  Why bother changing anything if you have a good thing going right?  I had brought my friends who had never been as well as my wife and we had ordered each different sandwiches while my friends ended up splitting a super corned beef.  I had ordered the super pastrami and my wife had the super Montreal smoked meat.  Super is basically a larger sandwich with cole slaw and fries (I think).  Either way the plates were only 13 bucks a piece which is not bad considering you are eating a huge sandwich.    While I had plenty to eat already my wife as usual couldn't finish hers and I was more than happy to oblige.  The food was good and the prices were reasonable as well.  While they also have Montreal style pizza here I think if I return I'm always coming back for the sandwiches though."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for Montreal Smoked Meat, quick breakfasts and casual meals.    Food quality is good for value and wait staff are attentive.  Portions are decent size."}
{"text":"The place is old, not very clean &  I have had better food off a coffee truck! Never ever will we go back!"}
{"text":"Came here with my daughter for the second time yesterday. This place feels to be an authentic Montreal Deli. This place reminds me of Jarrys Smoked Meat in Anjou (North Montreal). It's absolutely delicious. I can't believe this place has been around as long as it has. Service was good. Food is fantastic. Nothing like a Cherry Pie and Store Made Cherry Coke to wash it all down after a delicious old fashioned smoked meat sandwich and spicy crispy fries.    The waitress told me they do in fact have poutine (but not on the menu). And they make a Smoked Meat poutine which I'm dying to try. I want to try their pizza and spaghetti too. If it's Montreal style I'll be in love.  A little more attention to menu items appearing is a small example of how this place could rock."}
{"text":"Very large portions, 13 will get you fries, coleslaw, pickle and sandwich I had the ruben, nice rye, good size portion of smoked meat, swiss cheese grilled up, the meat was sliced well and tender. Service was super friendly, this is an old school family restaurant spot. Not fancy, but tidy, comfortable tables. But it's not going to win decor awards. But if you want a big lunch for a not big outlay it's a great place to go with parking available as well."}
{"text":"Ordered an \"All Dress\"   Au mon Dieu!   The sauce was sweet, the cheese and pepperoni were real, no franchise let down here folks! Everything else that came out of the kitchen looked wonderful, great place without the drive to Mtl."}
{"text":"From interior to customers, screams old school. Mainly white, older male clientele. Service was friendly and fast. The all brown kitchen crew, very efficient. Generous portions but like other reviewers have commented, everything was dry. The coleslaw was dry. The meat was dry. Shared parking lot so a bit crowded."}
{"text":"Great old school diner with huge portions!  Montreal smoked meat sandwich was phenomenal and the staff is extremely friendly.  Hidden gem in Mississauga"}
{"text":"This was our go to place when we don't want to cook.  Their reubens are so satisfyingly good,  the house special pizza with the Montreal Smoked meat was crave-inducing and the pie tower was slobberingly good!  Most of all,  I miss the friendly and helpful staff and most importantly... Habs fans! It's only been less than a month since we left Ontario and we already miss you."}
{"text":"Fast service and hefty portions. Nice find, as good as you will find outside of Montreal."}
{"text":"Took my crap car, Yelp's own Susan C. and her better half (who has a most impressive Montreal pedigree) out on a Sunday jaunt to the edges of Mississauga for what is generally reputed to be the best smoked meat to be had in Toronto. Well, the GTA.  The Montreal Deli is just west of the 427 and has plenty of parking. That I'm leading with it being conveniently located just beyond an overpass and raving about the parking might not bode well. But it's not that bad.  Smoked meat in Toronto (or Mississauga) is what it is. Depending on your Clintonian definition of what \"is\" is, Montreal Deli is doing its best. Prices are reasonable. The super smoked meat plate (about $11.50) gives you a nice stack of meat, fully acceptable fries, slaw, and a kosher dill. If you think of this as anything *but* a simulacrum of the true Montreal smoked meat experience, well, it's pretty awesome all around.  For purists, I've included in the photo section a photo of the Montreal deli smoked meat super combo and the gold standard of smoked meat, Schwartz's. A keen observer will note the difference in consistency of the meat. The Montreal Deli serves it up almost like a thinly sliced ham. Schwartz's gives you thick rich slices of smoked meat ready to crumble and then melt in your mouth. [Oh god, 2.5 hours until lunch time. - your stomach butting in]  Susan C's better half quibbled with the bread and I defer to his judgment there. I was a suburban boy (a shout out to my homies in Dollard-des-Ormeaux!) Susan's better half is a McGill grad, hence a veteran of smoked meat and it probably goes without saying the Peel pub. From his lack of joyous weeping, I gather he was in the same opinion boat as I.  I'll say this, however, service is fast. I think we had our food in about five minutes. I've waited longer at McDonald's for a McFlurry.   Bottom line: prices are great, service is fast and great, you get a lot of great food, it's still not real Montreal smoked meat, but give it a try.  (Those without access to a crap car, you can subway it to Kipling, I think jump on the West Mall bus, and then get off before it diverges off Dundas. It's not an unpleasant walk to the Montreal Deli.)"}
{"text":"It's not posh, but it's not supposed to be.  I almost gave them four stars because the service isn't as rude as Schwartz's or Ben's in Montreal - but this is pretty much the real thing.  They even have black cherry soda, without which the whole thing would be a complete fail.   Great sandwiches, probably the closed thing to Smoke Meat Pete (my choice in Montreal) that I've found in the GTA. Came with an old friend who used to frequent the place years ago, she noted that other than not allowing smoking anymore it hadn't changed even a little bit."}
{"text":"This place is my husband's guilty pleasure.   I, however, am not a huge meat eater but, to simply put it, amazing smoked meat and corn beef sandwiches.  Enormous portions - I swear like five inches high - there is no way most people could eat one of those sandwiches (and fries) in one sitting.  Speaking of the fries, did I mention that they make the best fries and gravy ever - so old school but so enjoyable."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches here. Maybe not as good as some of the smoked meat places I have been in Montreal but darn good. They use a thick sorta chewy bread here which is very filling but decent. Overall I liked the place and would go again."}
{"text":"First time I went here I could have cried it was so good. I went on and on about this sandwich for weeks. I was in love with this sandwich, I could have married it. The second time was disappointing. I guess after the love affair between me and the first meaty good sammy left me on such a high there was no way to make it compare. It was still good but it was earth shaking like the first. In conclusion, the sandwiches at Montreal Deli are like crack, you will become addicted and keep chasing the dragon after the first bite."}
{"text":"Pretty good facsimile of a Montreal deli.  Great service.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was once a frequent visitor to this restaurant as I worked close by. I haven't been in some time. The food this time was not good. I ordered a Corned Beef on Rye with a side of fries (well done) & it came with coleslaw & pickle.  It wasn't good. The Rye bread was stale & crumbly (suppose to be fresh). The Corn beef was cold & dry (suppose to be warm & juicy) & the coleslaw was dry as well. the pickles used to be giant are now just a small wedge. I'm disappointed. It used to be sooo good! Doubt I'll go again.  Once good note....service was very good & friendly."}
{"text":"We just had a fantastic dinner here. They have the best smoked meat this side of Montreal. We asked them where they get it and they said they get their smoked meat from Montreal. No need to go to Montreal to get smoked meat anymore now Toronto has it!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Went with my family for lunch. We all had the Montreal Smoked meat. The sandwich was good and really enjoyed the fries. They get bonus points for having malt vinegar. Overall the service was very friendly. I would give another try."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some Montreal style smoked meat. Given that I travel between Toronto and Ottawa frequently we (wife and I) always try to make it to Montreal for the smoked meat at our regular spot.  On this occasion we were searching for a similar experience although we had no expectations that it would be of the same calibre as Schwartz's.  We decided on the Reuben and Smoked meat sandwich with the coleslaw and fries. A Few things to mention:  The sandwiches tasted great! The smoked meat sandwich is not as juicy or fatty ( or as good) when compared with Schwartz's but was certainly a great sandwich. The Reuben however stole the show with its flavour. They were both large sandwiches packed with meat and the coleslaw and fries went well with it. Go for the larger sandwich that comes with the slaw and fries - a great deal.  Our server was friendly and helped with suggestions for us and also suggested I try the \"old style\" Reuben next time which I'm looking forward to.  Ambiance is nice enough - no frills or fancy decor but then that's not what you're there for. It's clean, the service is great, and the meal won't burn a hole in your wallet! We made it halfway through our sandwiches before we were full  and will definitely go back.   Anticipate spending 15-20 per head and having a very filling and great tasting sandwich."}
{"text":"Before I go into my review, I had another odd incident happen to me after I checked in on Yelp at this establishment three weeks ago.   Within minutes of checking in on Yelp, our server came over and asked for someone with my first name. I indicated that it was my first name, but that I was not expecting anyone to reach me at this restaurant.   This same issue happened to me at another place back in July. Commonalities include the following: - Both restaurants were in Mississauga - Both phone calls happened moments after I had checked in on Yelp - The caller asked for my first name and claimed that the call was urgent  After discussing this predicament with helpful Yelpers, let me say the following to this person: - I am not going to waste my time dealing with such a juvenile prank. How would you like it if I bugged you during a casual meal? It's rude.  - Don't call and say that it's an \"emergency\" and that I must take the call. If it were one, my cell phone covers that communication channel. No one would be reaching me at a restaurant.   - Dude, you need a new hobby and perhaps an introspective review of who you are. Put yourself in my shoes. Do you want to be interrupted eating a meal with such a call? If you do, you need help. I don't appreciate it. Restaurant staff that you are hassling don't appreciate your games, either. Keep on calling. I'm not falling for it.   Now, back to my review.   Five of us came here for lunch as part of our team's Friday ritual. I drove four colleagues and our boss rode his motorcycle over. He followed me, as he had no clue how to get there.   We were the first ones there at noon. We sat at a round table.   Our server was sweet and helpful. I asked her what the difference was between the old-fashioned and super Montreal smoked meat. The former has a black pepper crust. The latter does not.   I also asked where what kind of mustard she has. From her black apron belt, she yanked out five different types of mustard. I was blown away! Such a quick draw! She even had honey mustard and Jack Daniel's.   I ordered the Super Montreal smoked meat (medium) platter, which comes with fries, coleslaw, and a pickle. I asked that the fries be swapped our for onion rings. Instead, I got both fries and onion rings.   It was generous of my server to let me keep both. I loved the fries. I normally get bored of them. These were fresh, taste?, creamy on the inside, with the right amount of crispness.   The onion rings were amazing! I couldn't eat them all and took the rest home. So good! They weren't thick or raw. They were perfect.   My smoked meat sandwich was amazing. The bread wasn't soggy, but the meat was tender and juicy. I tried all the different types of mustard. As expected, I loved the honey mustard and Jack Daniel's, with the latter being my favourite. My manager agreed with my assessment.   The coleslaw was great. It was crunchy and flavourful. I took a bite of the pickle spear. I typically don't eat pickles, but it was tolerable for someone who isn't a pickle fan.   You get a lot of food. I looked at all the desserts displayed when I left. I may need to do a dessert order to go the next time I am back.   I can't wait to try more menu items. The smoked meat truly made me think that I was in Montreal, but without the travel costs.   (209)"}
{"text":"I used to love this place several years ago, but now it is very sub par. Smoked meat sandwiches are not like they used to be. Place is also dirty and run down. Not sure if they have a new owner but I will not be back."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there, we're all from Montreal and we were craving some good smoked meat. We decided to try this as the reviews were good.  Very disappointed.  The meat seemed processed and greasy. It was ok, but definitely not like the real thing in Montreal. The club sandwich is very good though!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The place is packed with elderly people at lunch, and I think that's just because they know what's good and what isn't.   It's a great diner type place, very casual, very quick service with a great selection of deli sandwiches and more.  If you're not in the mood for a sandwich, try the souvlaki.  This is one of my favorite places to eat, I love it and would recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Had a great smoked deli meat sandwich. Came with thick-cut fries (perfectly fried), coleslaw and half pickle. Super friendly and quick service. Would definitely go again!"}
