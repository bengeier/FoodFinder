{"text":"The bacon tomato and spinach sandwhich on rye is sooooo good! Yummy"}
{"text":"The Barista needs help in the morning. My second visit; arrive around 7:00 am, 3 or 4 people.  It took me about 8 mins just to take the order. I saw 2 people walk out because they couldn't wait any longer.  This IS NOT the barristas fault. She was pleasant and working hard, but she can only do so much.

Great place, good atmosphere, parking limited. Overall great place, just need more efficient processes in the morning. I will keep coming back and hope it gets better; great potential!"}
{"text":"The barista seemed nice but came in for tea....didnt like their teas as much as Jarrods down the street. I might come back to try their coffee but not sure.

Bad vibe....Had 2 filthy couches ( I felt if I sat on them I might get bit or something, mind you I am not boojie or anything...It was just gross ), a pool table, and several high top tables. Felt more of a bar that served food than a little coffee shop. The bathroom is dingy and smelled like urine (again reminded me of a bar ). 

However they make some baked goods and tried their zucchini bread....not too bad. I also bought some other goodies to bring home....

They also sold ice cream, I believe Thrifties.

But honestly not sure if I would come back there...been there, tried that type of thing !"}
{"text":"My mom ran in yesterday to grab me a menu for me while I waited in the car with her dog. After about 5 minutes she finally gets back in the car with a (dirty) paper menu and says she'll take me somewhere else to get coffee and starts driving. Of course I ask what happened that made her so upset we had to leave. She said the moment she walked in the restaurant something was weird, there was a man sitting at the corner table with no food or drink and then another man waiting for his drink to be made both men are staring at the \"barista\" who was practically half naked wearing a skirt that didn't even cover her butt cheeks. She was leaning over in front of these men obviously trying to give them a show for what I'm not sure maybe a tip? Talk about no morals, I'm sure her parents are proud. Anyway my mom asked her for the menu and the girl acted as if my mom ruined her entire day and said \"I have no idea what you're talking about\" so my mom explained to her what a menu was and she replied with \"ok you're going to have to wait because I'm busy\" so she waits while  the \"barista\" is doing whatever she's too busy doing to grab a piece of paper right by her registerand hand it over to my mom. She watches these disgusting men in the cafe pretty much masterbating in their minds over this girls lack of clothing and her purposely bending over in front of them every chance she gets. So yeah great first time experience not so much.. obviously I won't be coming back but from reading the owners comments below he doesn't give a **** about customer service as he himself is rude to his customers as well and obviously only hires employees that do the same. Oh and supposedly the girls name was Erin from what I gathered when I called the restaurant about 15 minutes after we left. I said some not so nice things but maybe she'll start treating people better (: 

Great advice Victor K.! I will definitely take that into consideration!"}
{"text":"I have been to this coffee house only a few times and they do have great coffee and I love that they roast the coffee locally. 

However, on Saturday morning I stopped in and got a coffee and their Gold Panner's Sandwich to go. When I got home and went to eat the sandwich I noticed the bacon looked weird, so I open the sandwich to check it out. The bacon was completely raw; not under cooked, it was not cooked at all. The meat was still pink and the fat still milky white, which made the entire thing inedible and had to be thrown it away. This concerns me because (1) I could have gotten severely sick if I had not noticed it and eaten it, (2) apparently their \"cook\" cannot tell the difference between raw and cooked bacon, and (3) that their raw bacon is that close to their cooked bacon that it can be so easily mixed up. Also, the lack of proper food handling and the lack of knowledge of proper food handling procedures, is a bit concerning to me."}
{"text":"I love lost dutchman! Get the gold rush  hot or cold it's the best drink ever!!  The girls are the sweetest barristas around ."}
{"text":"NOT WHEELCHAIR FRIENDLY!!!  Casual looking place and smells great.  NO low tables unless you want to sit outside and bake.  Terrible over sight on the part of the owners."}
{"text":"Quite a frustrating experience. I ordered three different lattes and it took 30 minutes for the young man to make two. There was another young girl there standing around seeming absolutely clueless. The whole shop was full of frustrated customers I finally asked them to refund the third coffee so I could get out of there. Even though I work just down the block I will find another coffee house to go to. Thankfully there are other choices of coffee houses in the area so I will not have to go through this frustration again."}
{"text":"Stopped by there this morning and got an iced caramel macchiato with almond milk.  I also got a chocolate covered coffee been with my coffee too for free.  Prices are great and pastry prices can't be beat.  Got a cranberry orange scone and it tasted pretty fresh.  Excellent coffee and very nice interior/atmosphere.  Surprised it wasn't much more packed.  Server was very friendly and professional. I live nearby and work from home frequently so can see myself coming here often.  Hope business picks up more so they stick around; that building has seen many tenants.

One thing that has been consistently important in my choice of going to any customer-oriented business is customer service.  Unfortunately, based on the seemingly vindictive nature of the owners response to a negative review, I don't believe I will be going back here.  Yes, you may write off my opinion too if you wish, it doesn't matter to me.  Your coffee is only worth so much if it's served with a side of disrespect.

Examples of unprofessional behavior: kicking out and threatening to call the police for no given reason on a customer if they return (the fact that they gave him water makes him a customer), attacking a writing style (seriously?), going through someone's review history to deem whether or not you believe their opinion is valid (most people do review only negative experiences, so I don't see anything out of the norm here)."}
{"text":"Went in to use WiFi, it did not work. Sent a note via my Square receipt that I would not be coming back. Here's the reply I got,\"GOOD\". What a terrible attitude. Absolutely will not support a business with such an attitude. Wish I could give them 0 stars."}
{"text":"Ponya out barista was an absolute delight to interact with and my cold coffee beverage was prepared professionally and at a fraction of Starbucks!
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a cool place to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee.  They roast and sell their own coffee so it does not get any fresher than this.
The place is cool with a great combination of A/C and ceiling fans that makes you feel more \"outside\" in a good way!
The coffee was great and there is even a pool table (needs a coin though)."}
{"text":"Always, ALWAYS amazing service. This is he best coffee place I have ever been, which says quite a bit given that I enjoy cafe hopping and have tried much of the caffeine hookups wherever I am (including the Seattle, Tacoma areas of Washington; most of northern Oregon, a grand chunk of California (well, most of it top to bottom) and now in Arizona some places fr Flagstaff to Sedona to Gilbert). 
Anyhow, I recommend their Gold Rush: espresso, half and half and a bit of vanilla.
If you want something sweeter, they also serve affogados in three flavors. I like chai and espresso so I get the Dirty Chai Affogado, which is vanilla ice cream, a shot of espresso, and chai concentrate syrup.

Really though, of the variety of baked goods, coffees, and teas I have never been disappointed.
With the outdoor and indoor seating, rustic setting and mostly dark wood design it is soothing and what a coffee shop is really meant to be.
Also, the baristas are knowledgeable, friendly, listen and are willing to try something new, and are patient. 
Easygoing, non stressful places to get coffee. Even when busy, I don't get that anxious, claustrophobic feel from a chain like Dutch Bros or Starbucks."}
{"text":"I've been coming here about every day for the last few years and I always have great customer service! I love the quality of the coffee but it is a little on the pricey side. The girls are very knowledgeable and helpful! I think management should staff more than one employee sometimes bc the wait tends to be long for drinks. I also feel like they should invest in more than one outlet for those who bring in their laptops."}
{"text":"Nice small coffee shop in Mesa, AZ.

Pleasant atmosphere and friendly service.  Good coffee, ice cream, and a pool table.  The blues on the radio added a nice cherry on top of the visit.  

Tried the \"gold rush\" (cold). Creamy but needed a little bit more sweetener.  All in all, I think they have a nice shop here.  I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I am very pleased with this new spot! I've been a few times, the service is consistent: friendly and quick. It doesn't hurt that the prices aren't bad either. 

The cold press is amazing, I have made this my new go-to during the week. Haven't tried the food yet, but always looks delicious. 

I've seen a couple businesses come in and out of that shop since I've worked downtown but I have high hopes for this place & definitely recommend trying it."}
{"text":"I wish we could give zero stars. Stopped in before going shopping with my sister. I ordered an iced coffee drink. So before I get my coffee I asked the girl at the register a couple of questions every answer was very short and she was rude seemed uninterested in answering my questions. I had never been there so I explain the type of drinks I'm interested in she just gave me a look. They were not busy there were two other customer sitting down and no one in line. I travel all over and taste different types of coffee and their coffee beans have a very sour taste. So the fact that the coffee is not very good and the girl was rude to me and also rude to my sister. My sister basically asked her about their menu and the girl was just whatever about everything she said to us. I really should've just returned my coffee and said F you!"}
{"text":"Super cute and cozy. Unpretentious coffeehouse, finally I found you! Gold Rush is delisssssh. Can't wait to go back. Nice barista, too!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to start.  Staff is beyond unfriendly.  

I asked for a ice macchiato, y'know like Starbucks, no questions asked..?  The girl proceeded to ask if I wanted the shots poured hot over the top or at the bottom..?  I don't have knowledge of how a macchiato is deconstructed..  She basically spoke to me like I was an idiot for not knowing..  Fine, pour hot shots over my iced drink if that's how it's done.  

I asked for almond milk, she proceeded to make my drink with whole milk right in front of me..  \"ma'am excuse me, are you using whole milk?\"  [her] \"Do you want almond?\"  \"Well yes I just said that like 5 times.\"

My drink then came out without anyone saying it was ready..  Smack my head."}
{"text":"I was turned away 10 mins before closing, a terrible first experience. I do understand people want to go home, however I feel you should stick to your business hours. It is coffee.. not a 30 minutes meal.

Highly dissapointed, and I will never frequent this place again."}
{"text":"Would be nice if they opened earlier. Great French press coffee and a nice selection of banana and zucchini breads. I love the staff."}
{"text":"Staff was very rude. Coffee was nothing special very plain and boring. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"A cool place for hot coffee just off Main in down town Mesa. Great service by knowledgable employees serving great coffee and expresso. I like the warm feel of wood floors and tables. The pastry case contained a nice selection, including a very tasty quiche. The coffee is roasted locally by Lost Dutchman Coffee, so you can sample new coffees and buy a pound in a very well constructed stay fresh bag. The music is not obtrusive and they have a pool table, suggesting people should socialize rather than bury themselves in electronic devices, but there is WiFi."}
{"text":"I came to Mesa from Los Angeles to work the Spark Music and Arts Festival. Admittedly so, I am a bit of a coffee snob, as I was a barista for 2 years. The Lost Dutchman was right across the street from the Mesa Art Center so I figured \"might as well, anything is better than starbucks.\" This place thoroughly impressed me. From the Esspresso machine and the time they put into making a proper drink i could tell they cared about providing a quality Product, and at a reasonable price. Definitely try the tomato bacon spinach panini. Iced americano was delicious as well. Overall great place!

The fact they do not use soy products is great, I would like to see them try to use more organic, less Artificially sweet  flavoring to add to the flavor of their coffee versus taking away from the rich tones of a good bean and brew. Less is more!"}
{"text":"Love the Goldrush drink with an extra shot! Also, Megan the barista is super friendly and makes the best drinks!!!"}
{"text":"First time being there. Jay was very friendly and made some really awesome Chi Tea. Will defiantly come back!"}
{"text":"Buy some roast coffee from here.  You can normally find bags that have been roasted in the last few days.  Staff is nice.  There are new couches that are nice and the pool table is gone.  There ARE better breakfast places around, but their food will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"I had the absolute best Triple, almond milk latte I've ever had!  I can't stop reacting after every sip!  The espresso is so rich and earthy!  I work close so I'll be back soon!  If your in downtown Mesa, it's a must stop!"}
{"text":"Had the Prospector's Scramble.  Not bad for $5.75, not a large portion, but enough.  Dollar refills on coffee is a good thing."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have the best sugar free vanilla latte hot or iced. I come in the mornings and always have nice service. They just got rid of the ice cream and now have gelato. Of course, now that I am going to be working way out east. So I had to try the chocolate and it was YUM! It tasted like Belgian chocolate. One of the reasons the sugar free latte is so good is because they use Monin syrup. It doesn't have the chemical taste that Torani and DaVinci have. I've also had the Chai with soymilk and I like that it isn't super sweet like some places. I'm going to miss this place. I will have to stop anytime I am in the area. I haven't found any good coffee shops at my new location. (Power and University, does anyone know of any?)"}
{"text":"I woke up at 12pm with a hangover and needed some pick me up. It was a Sunday and one of the few spots within walking distance of my hotel that was open. I guess Mesa has some goofy fucking Mormon law or something. Anyway it was a nice spot to get out of the blast furnace and recharge. Very nice counter help and with a mellow vibe. A very low key, non pretentious java den. Had a tasty iced coffee and a very tasty, cheesy breakfast burrito. I'd hit this joint again if I ever found myself with a hangover in Mesa."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop! Come see this little gem, micro roasters and creative coffee assemblies. Pool table and bar top seating. Try the dirty chai! Highly recommend it! There are sweet and salty little toffee bits at the bottom! Yummy over ice! It would be a cool spot for local art or open mic's."}
{"text":"Hands down my fave coffee shop in the whole valley. Sassy ass tattooed girls serving coffee. The menu is simple and if u want Starbucks macchiatos you gotta tell them what exactly you want so cry a fucking river. Keep it simple, this is a true coffee lovers paradise. Shoutouts to the owner for upgrading some of the furniture!"}
{"text":"not open on weekends which is the only time the majority of tourists and shoppers are in downtown Mesa. Lo-Fi coffee is though so I'll go there instead."}
{"text":"I was at the auto shop near by and was looking up and down Main St for breakfast at 9am on Saturday. There was nothing! I found Dutchman and their red Open sign. The hours on their door said 8am. They were not open at 9am. There was a tiny handwritten note saying \"open at 11\". For a coffee/bakery joint, 11am is pretty ridiculous."}
{"text":"Since my friend, for whom I was driving during his job search, was called twice to his place of interview (a good sign, right) in Mesa City Center, this turned out to be a good place for me to wait for him to finish his interviews. I was able to try their Americano, the mango tropics smoothie, and the vanilla elephant chai - all very good, as were the prices. The coffee house has a very comfy vibe, friendly staff, and of course, free wifi. The limited parking can be a problem, but on the plus side, it's right diagonally across from the intersection corner of the new City Center station of the light rail."}
{"text":"Desperately needed hydration after a round of golf and happened to stop in this cute coffee shop. 

Discovered they make fresh brewed tea and the barista suggested the ginger/peach iced, which was DELICIOUS!

Not only that, but I usually deal with leg cramps after a round of golf in summer heat, but I felt great the rest of the day! I'm not sure what was in that hand-crafted tea, but it's now my quick recovery method on a hot day!

And the super friendly barista was the icing on the cake! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little coffe stop. It has character inside like a pool table and pool sticks. A few tables had games like checkers on them.

A variety of different seating options including a couch. Tables and wooden chairs.

They offer a food menu. I didnt order from that, although their blueberry muffin was tasty.

I ordered an appagato. Hella yummy with espresso and ice cream. I had never had one of these. And can now say that I am a fan.

The service was friendly but kinda slow. There was only one person working. So she was taking and making all the orders. 

Pricing is about the same as any other java joint. 


A neat thing that they sell is green coffee beans for people who roast their own beans at home."}
{"text":"Took a few times before I became a fan, but the coffee is strong and delicious. The baked goods are made in house and they have a great selection of savory breakfast and lunch options. Try the gold rush you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of coffee shops to choose from on this tiny stretch of Main street. This is not my first, or even second choice. They usually refuse any requests I have to modify my food (like, can I get the veggies from the veggie scramble on the side), and they don't smile. Even when I make jokes, I don't even get a courtesy smile. 

Oh, also, I tried to order two scrambled eggs at 10:22 and they said they were done serving breakfast. (They do breakfast til 10:30)

Updated: 
They've hired much, much friendlier girls. They smile! And the new cook, Laura, is so sweet and accommodating. I get a Miner Burrito with no meat, and she always pops out to ask if I want an extra egg or spinach in place of the meat."}
{"text":"I would say at this point I'm a bit of a regular. I have become addicted to their La Manita roast. I highly recommend it. Megan is a total sweetheart, great customer service and always smiling. I'm a little shocked by some other reviews on here. I've been in here well over a dozen times in the past year and aside from occasionally being out of my favorite blend in whole bean, I can't think of anything not to LOVE about Lost Dutchman. Keep that la Manita in stock!! :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Clean and fantastic ambiance. Afghato classic is the best coffee dessert I have ever had. Love to go here because it is a quiet place to enjoy and read a book or do work.  Two comfortable couches. Go here regularly and love it."}
{"text":"Great coffee and barista was friendly and helpful.  Loved it! Prices were fair and the coffee was perfectly brewed for real coffee lovers...made to perfection.  I did not have time to check out the place, I stopped in on a whim for a caffeine boost to finish a school paper and this former Washington girl was surprised by some good coffee in AZ.  Surpasses Starbucks easily and a just as good as Dutch Bros, yet here you can relax and spend some time"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a coffee. The barista was very friendly and suggested trying their featured coffee, the gold rush, and it is delicious.  Double shot of espresso, cream and a hint of vanilla...yum!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and each time the employee's seem put out. Apparently if you arrive within 15/20 mins to closing you get treated poorly and and don't get free reign of the menu. Perhaps wait till the store closes before washing and shutting down equipment. Not open evenings, weekends or during Mesa events...what a shame. I urge people to check out Jarrods down the street....friendly, inviting and fantastic coffee. Maybe the employee's are paid poorly?"}
{"text":"This coffee shop had a nice atmosphere and the staff were very friendly. I ordered coffee and a sandwich. I give the coffee 5 stars. The sandwich was delicious, but a bit on the small side for the price."}
{"text":"Only 4 stars because I grade hard. Had the Affogatos recommended by so many others, spectacular. Decor was great, vibe was relaxed, wished I'd brought quarters for the pool table. If I were to be really picky, i'd upgrade one of the couches and make sure the bar height table I sat at didn't wobble, but let's be honest, that's a standard that's asking far too much. I've lived in AZ about 2 years and am regularly disappointed when I compare spots here to Manhattan and Brooklyn, The Lost Dutchman Coffee House could compete favorably.  Highly recommended, my 4star rating represents a 5star by virtually all others. Make this spot a regular if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich on ciabatta was fresh and delicious. I made the right decision to check out this cute place. Also ordered a macchiatto which was just right. Barrista was cheerful and knowledgeable. If I am in Mesa again, I will be back!"}
{"text":"VERY delicious coffee.  Stumbled upon this quaint little coffee shop when my hipster vagabond couch surfer friends came into town.  They wanted some real coffee. We came in and we're greeted by Zelda who explained every coffee and almost every drink.  I now come over here when I need my coffee fix and just love seeing Zelda because she always gives me new things to try.  Great coffee.  I recommend their Carmel macchiato.  The coffee is very smooth and not acidic like most mainstream coffee shops.  Very worth the short car ride."}
{"text":"Met the woman of my dreams (currently fiance) there! 
The barista encouraged her to go on a second date with me.
The coffee was pretty good too. Lovely place."}
{"text":"Location, location, location! 

Lost Dutchman Coffee House gets business not because it has great service or amazing drinks. Customers come because it is the closest coffee shop to many of the city buildings and has a small parking lot out front (a luxury most Main Street businesses do not have). I guess those two things translates into not needing to care as much. 

It is very hit but more miss with this place. Drinks are pricey for what you get and the staff has an attitude more often then not. Also, the bathroom has an odd smell to it... 

There are ALOT of other coffee shops in Downtown Mesa that do it better. I suggest going to one of them instead but if you have a caffeine emergency Lost Dutchman will do."}
{"text":"I always avoid anything under 4 stars, but I was tired and it was close. I had an awesome affogato, great gelato, espresso and service!"}
{"text":"Full marks for being the only espresso shop anywhere near the convention center
This is a really laid back shop. The staff are very friendly and helpful. 

There is one thing. Some of the baristas boil the milk while steaming it. OK so extra-hot is in the eye of the beholder, but they steam the soy milk so much that it separates. Yechhh! All the protein curdles to the top and the result looks disgusting. I drank it anyway; I was that desperate. ****    Hey guys! Get a thermometer!    ****

It is clean and the couches are fine. It passes the bathroom test.

A relief from the hot Arizona sun, it is the best coffee within walking distance of the convention center."}
{"text":"Had the Prospectors Scramble. Really good with fresh spinach. French press coffee was also nice."}
{"text":"Ordered a latte, it's ok.  But the staff, not friendly.  I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"I was at the Mesa Arts Center this past monday for a concert, which ended up being delayed by 30 minutes, making me almost 2 and a half hours late. I'm European, and we love coffee, so when I spotted this gem from across the street, and decided I needed a pick me up and this was the place to go.
I came in about 10 minutes before closing so I had to make a quick decision as to what I wanted. Since it was warm outside, I decided on a Iced Caramel Macchiato. 

Oh my goodness. 

It was the most flavorful coffee I have had the pleasure to drink. From the first sip, I was in love. I didn't realize how long it had been since I had an incredible coffee drink. 

I am now trying to come up with reasons to be on that side of town (I live about 45 minutes away) so that I can go again and enjoy their coffee! I might end up just going there for the coffee... who knows :)"}
{"text":"The service was friendly enough but honestly the coffee tasted so watered down I thought it might have been a mistake. There was no rich, roasted flavors there and it was not fresh. I ordered a house coffee and a caramel macchiato iced coffee. The iced coffee wasn't any better sadly, it actually tasted like dirt! The iced coffee was not cold as well, with a few ice cubes floating on the top watering it down even more. I also ordered ice cream but it was just pretty standard ice cream in a tub, nothing special. The place looked cozy enough, but I won't be returning. I threw the coffee away after a few sips, it was that bad."}
{"text":"So this is a long time coming after my incident. I had spoken with the owner in two separate emails only to be denied the opportunity to come back or even speak with him. The lack of concern is showing since I have read all of the other comment since I have posted mine. It is unfortunate that a beautiful place as this allows it to be run by such individuals that do not care whether or not it actually survives"}
{"text":"This coffee shop has the most delightful chai tea lattes. I highly recommend the Elephant Vanilla, iced or cold.

Get french press, specialty coffees,  ice cream or affogatos (espresso poured over ice cream), root beer floats, cakes or cookies, 100% fruit smoothies, or pop in for a quick lunch of grilled cheese or a burrito. 

A pool table and couches make for an inviting atmosphere. High top tables and bistro chairs line one wall. On the weekends it is very quiet,  and an ideal time to sample one of those amazing chai lattes from David Rio. As part of David Rio ' s corporate philosophy,  a portion of their proceeds go to promoting animal welfare."}
{"text":"Right in Downtown Mesa with plenty of free parking. I got a hot mocha and a freshly baked cinnamon roll. The cinnamon roll was brought right away to my table warmed up with melted frosting. It was delicious. Unfortunately, after waiting for about 5-10 minutes, I had to remind the barista about my drink. There was a bit of communication breakdown between the two girls behind the counter. However, when I did get my drink (it was made right away after I asked), it was very good. Both large cinnamon roll and a medium mocha were together just over $8. The specials/seasonal drinks were in a weird place - on the front of the counter where you pick up your drinks and on a board on the floor when you walk in, so look for those before ordering - I didn't see them until I had already ordered and sat down and was a little bummed. Look for the creepy mannequin outside when you're coming from the north."}
{"text":"I've been here a maybe 4 times, nothing special as far as the drinks or coffee. I always ask for a recommendation from the cashier (as I usually just drink iced coffee) but maybe I haven't been recommended anything good because I'm never too impressed with the outcome."}
{"text":"I just ordered a cold pressed coffee black.  My palette isn't refined like some for coffee but I can say it was very good.  Staff seemed friendly and rushed as it just looked like 2 of them working. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for coffee and a muffin. Nice place nice people, good stuff!  Nice atmosphere and not too expensive"}
{"text":"Amazing cold brew coffee if you dont mind the wait in the mornings. If the Kitchen is open, the breakfast burritos are legit too."}
{"text":"There are some pretty harsh reviews out there.  I think the staff may put some folks off as, they're not overly friendly.  Whatevs.  Get over yourselves people.  Order your stuff and shut up.  Wifey and I enjoyed Lost Dutchman during a recent trip to Arizona.  We are hardcore coffee snobs, who appreciate properly roasted and brewed espresso-based beverages.  She's my latte girl and I her cappuccino boy.  At both visits, we were very pleased by the coffee: strong, robust, and flavorful with zero bitterness.  Absolute bean perfection.  At the second visit, we asked for breakfast sandwiches and were delighted with bountiful beauties on presented on what appeared to be locally baked bread, perfectly toasted, adorned with fresh spinach, and delicious scrambled egg combos.  Next time we're in the area, we know where to go for the best cup o' Joe around."}
{"text":"First time here. Just got into grinding my own beans and was looking for a local supplier. Only a small selection but they have a few excellent selections and most important supply the roasted date on the package so I know how fresh the beans are. Picked an Indonesian bean called Blue Dragon and had to try it as soon as I got home. Loved it! Also grabbed a couple of their blueberry muffins and have to say the best I've ever had. Will be back to spend some time. Very clean, funky place with helpful staff. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Almost didn't rate bc this is my regular place and I'd hate to see it get too crowded. Great atmosphere and almost never too busy. 
Parking can be rough if there's something going on downtown. 
Need a key to get into bathroom."}
{"text":"Different type of coffee shop than any I've been to in the area. Small, yet open feel. They have a couple couches surrounding a pool table. The rectangular tables are lined up and can fit up to four people. There are a few tables outside as well. They have lots of drink options including smoothies which are made of real fruit, and loose leaf teas. Their house special, the gold rush is the perfect ratio of half and half, 2 shots of espresso, and a bit of vanilla... So heavenly. There are 3 super nice girls here on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The other staff is not as friendly especially the one guy I've seen there. He smokes outside, sits on the curb on his phone, yells staff. I am guessing he is the owner or something. If my 3 favorite baristas ever go, so will I because his negativity weighs on the other girls and it shines through in their customer service and persona."}
{"text":"I like this corner coffee shop. It's a good place to get some work done (free wifi) or relax. The coffee is excellent, with $1 refills. The two staff members were very pleasant.

I ordered a breakfast sandwich, which was good. I do like that they include tomatoes and spinach, but it's odd that the baby spinach was raw. Still, the taste was good -- the assembly just seemed a bit disjointed.

Things I didn't expect to see: Hot food (breakfast until 10:30). Pool table. Scoop ice cream. Fruit smoothies. Creepy mannequin.

This place would deserve 5 stars, but I'm knocking one off because the other reviewer was right: it's bad business not to have at least one inside table that someone in a wheelchair can use."}
{"text":"We came for a stop just before going to the museum of natural history. The pool table is nice but does take up good real estate. The girl was extremely friendly and patient as I had 2 young children with me. We ordered a variety of things and she worked as well as she could with just her in the front waiting on orders. I would definitely stop again for a smoothie or coffee or a decent sandwich."}
{"text":"I was in Mesa for  a meeting and was early. I came across this coffee shop and I was dying for an iced coffee.. 

I ordered the largest size,  as usual, and was very surprised at the extremely high prices. A large iced coffee was nearly $7. I was also informed by the Barista that there was a charge for cream. I have never in my life ever been charged for cream in my coffee... The coffee it's self was a 7 out of 10 so product was good. 

As for the shop it's self,  nice place,  I love the pool table and sofa.. Staff was very nice. Just need to reevaluate the pricing structure so that customers are not nickle and dimed..... People hate that."}
{"text":"Good morning. Second visit to this local establishment. Good vibe, surroundings, and staff. Engaging and capable. The coffee speaks and draws me again. Also enjoyed baked good pairing. Have a great day!"}
{"text":"I always come here for the caramel macchiato's...they are honestly the best I've ever tasted. Great staff as well. I'd recommend to anyone to come and try."}
{"text":"I was just here around 11am today.  I was feeling dehydrated so I asked for a glass of water.  I was in the mood for coffee, but I wanted to drink some water beforehand.   I sat down with the water on the couch, and less than 10 minutes the female barista asked me to leave.  She said they can't allow loitering if I'm not going to buy anything.  But at the same time I was not allowed to go outside with the water.  So why even give me a water in the first place?   I was never even able to finish the water.  There was no one else in the coffee house except me.  I've been to this coffee house twice before and bought something.  The female barista served me before, and she was aware of that.  However, the male barista (or manager) with pony tail working behind the counter seemed to have it in for me from the start, so he decided to have the female barista do his dirty work and kick me out.   She was very friendly about it, so I don't dock her for doing her job as she was commanded, but this is a moronic policy.  It would've made more sense to ask me to leave after I finished my water and I was just sitting around for 30 minutes to an hour, and didn't buy anything, or I was being rude.  Their prices are already on the high side.  The most redeeming aspect about the coffee house is its location and atmosphere.  But it's certainly not very welcoming.  Previously, I was seriously thinking about meeting up with friends here.  Unless the owner disapproves of this kind of treatment, I'm doubtful I'll ever return.

There's a few things I'm wondering about this place.  If you come in with a group, and one person or half your party doesn't buy anything, do they get kicked out?  If it takes you longer than 10 minutes to decide what to order, do you get kicked out?  Do you get kicked out simply for being male?

Update 4/14/2015:   Previous to your comment you said the complete opposite in a private message.  In part you said, \"I do believe this policy was indeed not followed correctly as you obviously don't fall into  that category of people and I do apologize for what seems to have been an overzealous application of the policy.\"  I'm not sure if you're very impatient or psychotic, but it's only been one day since I left this review, and now you're threatening and slandering me.  I was obviously trying to work things out with you, because I even sent you a message that I left a review.  

Victor, I would be willing to go to court with that video surveillance, because I know you're lying.   You have nothing.   It's ok if you don't like me, whatever, I don't care. You and your staff are obviously jerks that get off acting elitist.  You sell coffee dude, that's all.   

If you actually reviewed your video surveillance, then you should know everything I said was correct. Maybe there's a slight margin for error, but that is all.  What exactly do you think is not correct?   What part of my review was in err?  Yes, I have negative reviews, but most of these businesses are low rated, or are already closed.  There is a good reason why I left a negative review for each of those businesses. Usually I reward a business by going back and spending money there, not by leaving reviews.   But you did make one good point, in that I should post a review of what a good coffee shop is like.  I haven't been to your competitors, but I'll check them out. 

One other thing: I got the impression your male barista or manager doesn't really like dealing with people.  When he talked, he mumbled out everything and was very hard to understand.  He said I couldn't go outside on the patio with the water due to having to pick up the glasses later.  Pretty insulting to presume I'd even leave a glass out there, but also indicates he's a lazy employee.  Maybe he's worked for you very well in the past, but he seems to have zero enthusiasm for his job at this point. 

Being in your coffee shop is a lot like being back in kinder garden, but with a gun to your head to buy something.   I don't think you know how to run a business, much less a coffee shop properly.  BTW, every business that was located where you're at has failed.  Behaving like a jackass to customers is only going to make your failure more imminent, and more likely.   I miss the guy who ran the BBQ before, he was great with customers, but even his business flopped at that location."}
{"text":"This was a great find. Sweet little hidding place to grab a latte and get some reading done."}
{"text":"I stopped in during a vacation and ended up coming back three times before I headed home a few days later. Staff is knowledgable and welcoming. They roast their own beans and because of that the coffee has a very unique distinguished flavor. I had the 24karat latte every time since it is without a doubt the best coffee beverage I have ever had. The drink is made with regular vanilla syrup but is not called a vanilla latte. The 24 karat latte is appropriately named because the espresso is what makes it so delicious and unique; you could swear it was liquid gold ;)

I would recommend if you are within 20 miles of this place and can appreciate a good cup of coffee then definatly come here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't do business here. I just got asked to leave because I was simply waiting for a friend so that we could order coffee together. Not sure what the guy with long hair and glasses problem was. I would hope they aren't racist. I was dressed in a nice t-shirt and jeans and had a nice pair of sneakers on. By the way I was going to buy coffee for my friend who is a retired Navy chief."}
{"text":"The barista was very friendly and had great suggestions on what to eat & drink (it was my first time going so I wanted inside info).  I met wonderful people while there, performers who invited me to the Mesa Center for the Arts for a show that night.  

Great location, great experience!  Oh, and the Yelp listing said dogs were allowed, so I brought my fur-baby and she was a huge hit!  Extra bonus points for that.  B-)"}
{"text":"My favorite local coffee shop in Mesa. Good espresso beverages, nice ambience. Only problem is it's not that big; as it gets more popular, there's not always enough seating."}
{"text":"A perfect little spot to teach my 5th old to read.  When mommy and daughter have a Yummie drink in hand, and a snack, we are all smiles.  I'm quite pleased I could get my perfect drink so close to home."}
{"text":"From the name sounded interesting and was in need of coffee. It was alright. The place looked like it fit the concept a little. Staff was friendly though."}
{"text":"Nice little local coffee spot. Baked goods but be nice if they had some breakfast sandwiches. Good place to hang, do some work it just grab and go."}
{"text":"I have tried several different coffees, including their French pressed coffee and I haven't had a bad cup yet.  The baristas are helpful and friendly.  Their sandwiches are really big and taste good but a bit pricey.  The sides that come with the sandwiches are okay.  The only other food I have tried is their cinnamon roll, which dry and a bit tasteless.  I love the sofas and the general atmosphere. It is a great place to drink really good coffee and talk.

Since my first review, they have shut down their lunch counter and only sell baked goods, bagels and oatmeal.  Their zucchini bread and brownies are delicious.  I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I thought the place was very nice. I enjoyed the jazz music and the friendly cashier. I ordered an 32oz Chai Tea with 2 shots of espresso. It was , definitely would recommend it. I thought it was a bit expensive ($6.25). Overall nice place and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Me and my friend stopped by here today. When we ordered breakfast sandwich which includes scrambled eggs, sausage, cheese, spinach and tomatoes they said they don't have spinach and tomatoes, so we asked if we can switch it to something else or get a discount and they said \"there's nothing we can do, do you still want the sandwich or no?\" We still purchased the sandwich, and when it arrived spinach had magically appeared on the sandwich.
Then I ordered a breakfast meal: scrambled eggs, sausage, hash browns and toast. When I got my food I was so disappointed, it was so little portion with one super small sausage cut on half. Then I went to ask for a butter for my toast and I guess girl didn't understand me and gave me a water lol  
I definitely wouldn't come back here for food, maybe only for cup of coffee."}
{"text":"After falling asleep a few times during a class for work I had to do something! During my 15 min break I walked across the street and picked me up a Carmel macchiato with a extra shot of espresso. The location is chill and clean, the Batista was hustling to get everyone in and out in a quickly fashion. I got my drink and sipped on it on the way back to class and OMG, it hit me! It def was strong and delicious! I felt shaky and super focused, like I could run thru a wall if I tried, shoot lasers from my eyes, fly around the world in 8 seconds, and totally stay awake in this class! I only drank 1/4 of it and had to stop for it had done its job!!! Great coffee, great prices!!!! Go to for coffee in the area!"}
{"text":"Nice little coffee shop in the heart of downtown Mesa. Baristas are very friendly which means a lot to me because for some reason I've met a lot of snobby baristas in my travels. Try the gold rush latte ( think that's the name)! It's made with half and half milk, vanilla and double espresso. It was absolutely perfect and delicious! All in all this place will do well with their great customer service, ambiance and drinks/food."}
