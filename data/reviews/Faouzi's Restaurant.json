- Small portions and overcooked, dry meat
- More bland than I expected. Not terrible though"}
{"text":"I had never tried Moroccan food before.  It was absolutely amazing!  I had the cous cous plate with chicken.  It was wonderfully spiced, much more than typical mediteranean food found around Madison.

My friends tried the falafel and said it was also amazing.  It was fresh and moist, unlike alot of falafel you find.

I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant and will be returning soon.  I just hope they make it in their location.  Easy to get to though..."}
{"text":"This is a place with a talented cook.  All the food we had was excellent and well prepared.  The bastilla (slightly sweet chicken pie in filo dough) was delicious and the kofta (meat ball) tagine I had was delicious.  The portions were very generous and I brought home half my entree.  Only problem was lack of a liquor license (it is in the works apparently) and also the annoyigly loud Moroccan CD playing the background that repeated  the same song over and over.  I will certainly go back once they can serve wine and beer.  Although it is not in the best location in the world,  the food was lovely."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the weird service and weird menu and weird location. Order something Moroccan - it's amazing. It's seriously so good. Totally worth the trip. Great hummus, great baba ganoush, great falafel. Definitely order the soup of the day (usually lentil). The Moroccan chicken is to die for."}
{"text":"This out of the way restaurant is a must try! The food was delicious, and reasonably priced for the portions. 
They are open from 10am to 10pm and have both a lunch and dinner menu. There are non-Moroccan choices on both menus such as wraps, sandwiches, and burgers, but no children's menu. Most of the dinner meals have a choice of chicken, beef, lamb or vegetarian. 
From the dinner menu my sister and I chose the Sauce Sampler which included hummus, baba ghanoush, couscous and guacamole and is served with pita bread. As entrees we chose the Moroccan curry w/beef and Falafel. We were served hot bread with olive oil and spices, and also a wonderful bean soup. For drinks we both chose the Moroccan hot tea w/mint. Our total bill was about $33.00, and we ended up taking food home. 
The food tastes very fresh and of good quality. The beef in my curry was very tender, and perfectly cooked, and the falafel was crisp with no trace of excess oil. The baba ghanoush had a smooth consistency (not mushy), and the hummus tasted homemade. Everything was spiced to perfection, not overpowering, not too subtle, and the hot tea w/mint completed the meal nicely.
From beginning to end it was a delightful experience!"}
