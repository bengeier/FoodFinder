{"text":"I've only tried the pork & shrimp xiao long bao ($9) and lamb & parsley ($9.5). Each basket contains 10 baos. I liked the pork better than the lamb but I could definitely taste the meat in both. It had a lot of soup broth (and piping hot too so be careful) that was tasty. I think they are comparable to Sammi & Soupe. The skin was thin but mostly resilient. Most of the baos did not break as I picked them up with chopsticks so a minimal amount of delicious broth leaked out.Besides, pork, pork+seafood and lamb, they also have beef XLB. I intend on returning to try some others. This is a small place but with a decent number of tables but really close together. Cash only. I hope all those 8s in their phone number give them prosperity."}
{"text":"Dumpling délicieux. Belle salle à manger et très propre! Service courtois. Pas cher. Manque un peu de variétés mais la sélection est bien malgré tout."}
{"text":"Easily the best soup dumplings I have had in the US.  The dough was thin and well cooked, the filing tasty with a well balanced flavor."}
{"text":"We went during Otakuthon on a Saturday. First and foremost, we placed our order at 7:30pm, the food came at 8:30pm. The owner of the restaurant gave a measly cold appetizer that was absolutely unappealing as complimentary. The food quality is good, however service was horrible. I suggested for future occasions they hire more staff for better efficiency and to give us a discount for the long wait, and I asked politely, turns out the owner just brushed my comments off plus gave me the nasty attitude.   My verdict, Sammi Dumplings has better quality Xiao Long Bao, good service orientated and friendly. I highly do not recommend going to Bien Maison, you go at your own risk."}
{"text":"I've been looking for soup dumpling places in Chinatown Montreal for the longest time, and finally found one! Their soup dumplings are great, and I also enjoy their woodear mushroom salad.  Their service time is a bit long; the 3 out of 4 times I went, it took nearly 40 minutes to get our dumplings. One time, the waitress forgot a friend's order and we had to wait some more."}
{"text":"Bien Maison is in the same family as Mai Xiang Yuan, which by far has the best (boiled) dumplings in the city. However, the soup dumplings at Bien Maison fell short of the standard set by Sammi & Soup.   The seafood ones I ordered rang in at a solid $13, and were premade. As a result, many of the skins of the dumplings broke and the soup leaked out of them.   The sweet pork ones were made fresh, which was a little better - the soup stayed largely intact. These rang in at $10.   The cucumber appetizer was also lack luster compared to that of Sammi & Soup, for $1 more than it's competitor - lose lose.   Overall, this was still an acceptable soup dumpling experience. However, for lunch, Sammi & Soup prices are much more reasonable, starting at $7 and averaging $9 for a basket of 10 dumplings, which very few broken skins.   Oh, and they don't take anything but cash here - it's 2018 for Christ's sake.   While I still think their parent company Mai Xiang Yuan is the undefeated champion for boiled dumplings, this experience was lackluster and definitively leaves Sammi & Soup and the standout in the soup dumpling scene."}
{"text":"An decent little restaurant in Chinatown that serves xiao long bao made fresh as you order. Reminds me a lot of Sammi soup dumpling on Ste-Catherine with similar menu items.   Food was good, service was decent, but the ambiance was lacking though. My boyfriend and I sat in silence in the near-empty restaurant when we went around 2pm. No music, no radio, no chatter. Complete and awkward silence lol. I would return if I had a craving of soup dumplings and was in Chinatown and didn't care for an ambiance. Overall recommend if you need a fix of XLB but not as much for a cozy gathering."}
{"text":"My first time trying soup dumpling...and I'm sold. The service required a wait, but they make the dumplings in-house and by hand. The hostess was very kind and informative. And 10% off soup dumplings! I look forward to visiting when I return to Montreal in the future!"}
{"text":"Descent xiao long baos,it took a while to get the food(20 minutes). The prices is a little bit higher than it's competitors, the quality a little bit worst. there is just something lacking with the montreal dumpling scene, it just doesn't make me crave for it like toronto does.  Service was pretty good, as the girl was attentive and efficient.   i would recommend going here if you are really craving for some soup dumpling, only if you are around the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ca depanne, dumplings corrects, le thé est offert et il est fumé pour ce qui aiment ca .. les toilettes ne sont pas bien entretenus.."}
{"text":"Yes, this spot may be on the same block as a much more heralded dumpling shop. But don't let that stop you from taking in these delightful little soup dumplings. Especially if you prefer your dumplings to be steamed and filled with a little broth in addition to meat.  My kids are soup dumpling fanatics, and these were their favorite XLB of the trip.   The one pro tip I have to offer is that if you can't decide on which dumplings to order, the kitchen will gladly split a batch into two different flavors. It's great to know if you aren't there with a big group of people and prefer to try as many things as possible.   Really, what I wanted to do was spend a few hours just having a progressive tour of Chinese treats, hopping from one great restaurant to another. Unfortunately, my family isn't into that kind of eating adventure.  My wife also isn't into me taking pictures of food at the table, so apologies for my lack of photographic evidence."}
{"text":"I'm so full of soup dumplings. This sister restaurant to Mai Xiang Yuan (right next door....same ownership)...specializes in soup dumplings.   If you want to get your slurp on, this is where to do it. If you're not slurping, you're doing it wrong. Don't be afraid of the slurp.  There are several varieties to choose from: pork, beef lamb, pork with seafood...and variations in these choices. We had the traditional pork and tried the pork with cilantro.  Both were awesome. The size of each (hand made) soup dumpling is perfect. So is the thickness of the skin...not too thick and not too thin. They arrive piping hot and face-blister worthy. Each delectable dumpling has just the right amount of soup.....to slurp.  If you don't have cash, go next door and get some because they don't take cards."}
