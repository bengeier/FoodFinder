{"text":"Absolutely the best sandwich and waffle fries.  Also a very fresh salad.  Ordered the club sandwich and southwest turkey sandwich both on fresh ciabatta.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wow is I can say great wings and pitchers great price will be back absolutely recommed"}
{"text":"Pros: The food is always good every time we come. We love the fact that this place offers Team Trivia during the weekends. Jake is a great server, and we have been served by the manager a handful of times - and he gave great service.   Now for the cons...  One server at the establishment, by the name of Izaak, was our server again tonight at Boulders. We all were within ear shot of each of his horrible comments he continued to make throughout the night. Directly behind our table he called us \"shitty tippers\" and as we were leaving he sneered at us and stated a derogatory comment wherein he said \"fuck\". As he picked up our tabs he had an angry affect and made a sarcastic \"wow\" statement while taking the bills away. Has it ever occurred to this person that they possibly do not get stellar tips (as we always make sure to tip even if we get awful service) because their service at times is rather mediocre? Talking shit about patrons in front of their faces is pretty damn unprofessional. If your service is mediocre, then your tip will be the minimum and you shouldn't be shocked about that.    This last night was honestly the last straw in regard to this poor service, and me and my friends will not be returning again. I am writing this review to give possible future patrons a heads up and let them know what might be in store for them."}
{"text":"Great experience. Food great. Service greater. Dessert was the greatest!  Stephanie was our server and she orchestrated a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dined here tonight and I must say it was a pleasant first time! It took a few minutes to get our waiter, Isaac, to come over to us but once he did, we got everything going very quickly! He got our drink order and was very helpful with my modifications to a sandwich I had ordered! All in all, it was a great place to wind down and enjoy a tasty meal at the end of a long day! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic their food is awesome and their beer selection is always out doing itself. On top of all of that they are constantly hosting different activities to bring friends and family closer together. Come check out their schedule you'll probably find something that you want to join in on."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer and always a good drink special.  Probably has the best Pizza in the east valley.... definitely worth it for the pizza alone.  Other menu items are good, and portion sizes are generous. Not the best place to watch sports, but has an adequate amount of TVs, including some HD flatscreens."}
{"text":"Have been here way too many times to count. The food is delicious and they add new things to the menu every now and then to keep it interesting. We've tried the majority of the menu and the only thing I'd pass on would be the hummus or the 'Pasta Romanitco' - they're pretty meh.   The people are awesome, the servers are great (though there is more turnover lately) and there are a billion regulars that are more than happy to chat it up.   The beer list is extensive, as all the other reviews mention. The list isn't always up to date and the app they created to solve this problem usually isn't either or it's not working haha. But c'mon now, finding one you like really isn't that hard. Over all, it's a pretty awesome place with some unique food choices and wide array of beer options served by awesome people."}
{"text":"Good local bar that only serves craft beers. Have 30 on the list today, from a Pale Ale through a Oatmeal Stout. Most bar appetizers are average,  but the fried pickles are the best in Tempe. Also, have daily specials, just ask server. Sports on every tv. Good place to relax and do nothing."}
{"text":"boulders is great.   i will leave it at that.    you drive past it everyday ..   stop in    lots of beer . pizza is great too .   rest of the food is ok...     hardly ever crowded.   juke box is horrible however."}
{"text":"Fast, delicious, amazing. Use them for delivery all of the time. Chuck Norris double decker is recommended.... Unless you're a wuss"}
{"text":"It was late Sunday night and not a lot of restaurants are opened in Tempe. Boulders on Broadway showed up on Yelp and has good reviews. They have an impressive selections of beers on tap, friendly and efficient  service. We all shared a Spinach artichoke dip, Big freaking nacho and California carver. The big freaking nacho is very interesting and good. The spinach artichoke dip is delicious. California carver pizza has grill onion ring toppings, very unique! I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"definitely need to get flat screens in the bar area, but thankfully the amazing selection of beers, and Alex and Dave's service, made up for the Analog Bears vs. Vikings game.    Did i mention all-you-can-eat one topping pizzas for only $7 on Sundays??  i was ashamed i could only make it thru 2 1/2... but they are huge!  unbeatable deal.  Rock!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few establishments where the best thing about the restaurant is the staff! My wifi was having issues and I needed to complete an assignment. My boyfriend came along for the ride and thank god they had Sunday football to enjoy as I worked for hours. As for working for hours they accommodated my need for an outlet and followed with great service.   Order the $5 pizza special and it was a bit bland. Follow by wings with yummy sauce and finished with the apple cobbler. (Mmmhhhmm) Even though we were camping at a table and it was a bit busy we receive great service for hours.  I've been wanting to stop by this place for a while now and I very much approve of this pub! Great management ! 5 stars, despite the pizza.. But the hospitality won me over."}
{"text":"We ordered several appetizers and I wouldn't recommend any of them - spinach dip greasy with little spinach or artichokes, pizza bites tasteless, bruschetta very odd.  Skip the appetizers I guess - maybe the main dishes were better."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of the atmosphere and also not the best place to watch the game.  Food was nothing to rave about but my boyfriend did enjoy his wrap.Truthfully I felt the place was a little dirty. The service was slow but the waiters were friendly, at least most of them. I have had better!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and the burgers are tasty.  Very different selection vs your typical bar burgers. Nice work"}
{"text":"The food and service was pretty good and the beer was delicious. HOWEVER, this is a local bar full of ignorant homophobic assholes and the patrons were less than welcoming to my girlfriend and I. LGBTQ and anyone with a working brain beware."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, good service, and great beer selection! Clean, rotating taps and knowledgeable staff. The crowd is also diverse: some ASU bros, Tempe locals, tattooed punks, laid back stoners, and older couples. All around great place (though I have not tried their food)."}
{"text":"I have not had beer here, but I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. It's beer. It comes from a tap or a bottle or a can. If you think that is an amazing feat worth writing about, come by and check out this killer lint I found in my navel. It's totally sweet. Bro.   The food was awful. I don't know how else to describe it. The group I came with ordered an assortment of things and we each tried a bit of the others food to confirm it was cold, bland and stale. I ordered a burger, medium-rare. It came overcooked and tasted like rubber. The bun was soggy. All the veggies on the burger were past their prime. It had no flavor. None. I tried adding ketchup and mustard and it did not help at all. I also ordered some Pepperoni Wheels. They were okay, but the marinara was off. It was chunky. Like salsa. Sort of. Large chunks of unidentifiable food stuffs floating in a vaguely red tomato-ish sauce. I ate two Wheels and that was enough. The ketchup was off too. It looked and tasted more like cocktail sauce. I don't know, maybe the staff was running on a lean mixture this day and muddled up the sauces. Who knows? I sure don't.   One of my friends ordered some wings. Those were not bad in my book, but she didn't like them at all. When you can still taste the vinegar over the hot sauce, I can see how it can be a turnoff.   I can't recommend this place. Never have I been in and out of a restaurant so fast before. We all got to-go boxes, which we promptly deposited into the outside trashcan by the parking lot."}
{"text":"Good spot for a pint. Not your usual Tempe bar.   They usually have an OK selection and I've never been let down by the service.   Go here and get a beer. (New motto for you guys... you're welcome)"}
{"text":"How is it I never have written a review for this bar? I've been frequenting this place for, what, almost 8 years now since it changed over from Old Chicago? Has it really been that long?   Well, now I feel old. Anyways, Boulders has one of the best curated beer selections in the state, and it is staffed by some of the best bartenders in the country. The pizza recipes are solid, the California Carver is the go-to pie, but the signature hotdog selection will always hold a special place in my heart. \"Hungover Man's Best Friend\" lives up to the name. Sweet potato tots...sooo good...  Try the bloody mary or mi-monkey if it's still early, or choose a tap at random. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We love this bar. The beer, servers and food is awesome. The beer selection is spectacular and reasonably priced ($4 for a specialty beer). And they have PBR for $1.25!! The burgers they had this summer were great! Soooo delicious!."}
{"text":"Really laid back little bar.  They serve your typical bar food, but I was impressed with the quality.  Their beer list is the best!  We started coming to Boulders every once in a while after the Four Peaks Tasting Room closed and bumped into some of the friends we made over there.  If you like beer and excellent bar food, this is your spot.    The building is interesting and the people watching is even more so.  This is definitely a hippie/hipster/college kid hangout but everyone was so friendly, and I'm talking staff and patrons alike.  You can tell a lot about a place by the friendliness of the people who spend their money there.  It also definitely beats the crowds on downtown Mill Ave. or all the pseudo intellectuals hanging out at Casey Moore's."}
{"text":"Super amazing food and extensive beer selection! You can ride your bicycle right on inside. Friendly service. Basically this place feels like home, except better, because it never runs out of beer."}
{"text":"The service was decent and so was the food. I had the \"Big Freaking Nachos\" and they were good. I was pleased with them.  The atmosphere seemed to be really casual, but almost too casual.  The restaurant was really dark and seemed like it would be clean enough to pass inspection, but no more.  The bathroom was run down and had broken dispensers and a broken faucet."}
{"text":"I wish I could give no stars. Came in, the sign said seat yourself, we sat there for five minutes patiently. After several people noticed us and ignored us we asked for menus from the bar, 5 more minutes went by and still we were not greated! I work in the restaurant business and I could understand if they were busy or understaffed, but there were maybe 5 tables in the whole place an employee eating lunch at the bar. We walked out because your establishment clearly didn't want our money, so we spent it elsewhere."}
{"text":"Boulder's is awesome! I live within walking distance and come a few times a month at least. Food is delicious (the cookie is amazing), great variety of beers on tap, the staff is solid and really good at what they do. Trivia night is always a good time too. Definitely worth checking out if you haven't already been."}
{"text":"Given that my friends and I come here on a near weekly basis to play Team Trivia, I figured it was about time to write a review.  While I have some tiny issues with the place, they never matter much since I always end up having a blast here.    There are TONS of different varieties of beer available in bottles, cans, or on draft.  Perfect for beer snobs and craft beer noobs alike.  Even if you're like me and pretty much get the same thing (Ranger IPA!) every time, there are still lots of options if you decide you want to mix it up.  Plus, the happy hour prices rock.  Food is your typical bar fare.  Fried appetizers, burgers, and pizza.  I haven't tried the pizza yet, but I've enjoyed the burgers I've had.  On Saturdays, the burgers are $6 which is a smokin' deal, considering that one burger could probably feed two people, plus you also get a side salad or fries.  The guacamole appetizer is fantastic as well.  Great for sharing.  Now for the main draw, trivia!!!  Tuesday, Saturday, and Sunday nights, Boulders has Team Trivia games, which are fantastically fun.  If people don't cheat, that is.  My friends and I have won twice so far (winners get a $20 gift certificate for their next visit.)  Never fear if you're not the ultimate champions- second place and third place get $15 and $10 giftcards respectively.  It's always amusing to hear other team names with pop culture references and profanity peppered in.  The teensy negatives:  What's up with the A/C??  The last few times I've visited, it's been just stiflingly hot inside.  It hasn't been enough to ruin the fun, but it's definitely a bit irksome to sweat inside in the summer.  Service can also be slow at times but this is mainly when there are 30 trivia playing teams, so I understand the delay.  Generally, even when it's busy, the servers are awesome and do their best to get your orders to you quickly."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a super chill bar to sit, relax, and enjoy a few beers with friends, Boulders is the place. Started by avid rock climbers who used to be employed at the restaurant that formerly occupied the business space, this place is a Tempe gem.   Delicious food, a large drink selection, great happy hour prices, daily specials, and one of my favorite things to do while the night is young on Saturdays--Trivia.  Grab a group of friends, pick a horribly offensive team name, and get ready to play TRIVIA with some of Tempe's... smartest? Er-- People with as much useless random knowledge as you.  My only gripe is that this place can get HOT during the summertime depending on what area of the bar you're in. But hey, this is Arizona, you should expect this anywhere you go."}
{"text":"I've been visiting Boulders on Broadway two to four times a month for about two years now, so I'm glad to make them my first review. I suppose it's fitting since I was there twice yesterday - for the Spain/France soccer game, and later for trivia.  Beverage Selection - 1 Star / 1 Star Excellent selection of craft and import brews. Extensive bottle list and over 20 draft beers. The Konig is a great summer hefe.  Food - Vegan - .75 Star / 1 Star So, there's only three vegan items on the menu - guacamole, hummus (I order with veggies not pita), and a side salad. Normally, this would get a restaurant .25 stars. However, yesterday they made me a really delicious dish of sauteed veggies with balsamic dressing, which was allowed because the kitchen was slow. Thanks to Lauren, our server, and Matt the GM for making this happen. I really appreciate it!  It would be really great if there was a hot, vegan entree. I'd be happy to pay $8-$12 for something with sauteed veggies, a sauce/dressing, and two-three different proteins (beans, nuts, avocado, rice, pasta, hummus, etc.) I love the guacamole, but its not a proper dinner.  Service - 1 Star / 1 Star Again, thanks to Lauren, and Matt for the great dinner! Also, our server earlier in the day (shaved head, wears a hat) was really good. Thanks for the Konig recommendation. The service here is usually pretty good, even when its really busy for trivia. Be a considerate patron (if they're packed, and you've been there for two hours getting wasted, don't get mad when it takes a few minutes for the server to split up your check and run your card,) and you'll get great service.  Ambience - 1Star / 1 Star A bit farther from campus than Mill Ave, the bro/bro-ho ratio is pretty low. Trivia is awesome, happy hour is relaxing, and there's a really fun atmosphere during Suns games.  Also, this place is really bike friendly with racks inside and out, and a tire pump. There are two larger rooms for big parties and seating upstairs.  There's also a patio, which is great in the winter because it faces west.  Cleanliness - 1 Star / 1 Star The bathrooms are clean and always have tp/ paper towels. There was some pretty awesome bathroom graffiti, but I noticed its been painted over. Tables never sit dirty for too long.   4.75 stars overall"}
{"text":"It's a great place to hang out on Friday and Saturday or even for lunch on the weekdays The bartenders and servers are great The food is nothing to write home about  and they have great prices for their  drinks         I would recommend this place to anybody"}
{"text":"Hell yes! First of all, try the Higher Math beer, I've never tasted a beer like that, and it's 17% ABV, whew!!! I didn't get a chance to try any entrees, but I did try the jalapeño tots and they were good!! This place is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Love boulders! Has a very quaint and chill vibe. They also have a TON of beers to choose from! I always try to try something new when I come here. They have great guacamole that they make fresh! Also, I really like the burgers."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Had a bacon cheddar cheeseburger with fries for around ten bucks.  Best burger I've had in a while.  Our server was Lindsey and she was excellent.  Very attentive despite a very busy night.  Got a great deal on Groupon and will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Server was great; very attentive and excellent service.  The food was wonderful and the beer selection made me wish I had not gone for lunch.  Sunday, all you can eat personal pan pizza.  Thursday and, I believe Tuesday, are 1/2-priced bottles.  Great place.  Although the price is above $10, it is not much beyond that price/person."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best Tap rooms in town! If you are looking for a place to go for great craft beer, amazing selection and knowledgeable staff this is the place! If you are looking for a place to watch a game or have a meal that consists of more then bar food.......go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Out of towner looking for a good bar...WOW! What I found was a great bar, great food, great atmosphere, great beer choices! The bartenders, Justin & Dave made my wife and I feel like we were regulars, very helpful on both food and beer choices. We definitely have found our regular go to bar for spring training...and yes, my wife and I will adopt both of you Justin & Dave again thanks! Also let me not forget to mention Ben the manager, what a great guy to work with...Ben you rock!  Brian S. Monrovia CA"}
{"text":"I love Boulders so much. Their food is delicious and their service is wonderful. There are so many different beer choices to choose from, and the happy hour is great. However, sometimes it can take FOREVER to get your food. So, if you're super hungry, I wouldn't recommend Boulders as your first choice. BUT I would most definitely recommend the place."}
{"text":"I was just thinking how long it's been since I've been to trivia on Tuesday nights and it made me sad.  I definitely need to get back into my trivia groove!  Other than missing trivia, I'm seriously craving some Jamaican Jerk Wings.  YUM!!  Not to mention the delicious guac that they'll make at your table if it's not too busy.    Great bar, one of my faves.  Great servers/bartenders and fun, come-as-you-are atmosphere.  Not a typical Tempe bar which is quite refreshing."}
{"text":"Love the beer list.   Foods good too.    Its a bar folks!"}
{"text":"They change there wings, I didnt like the wings no flavor. The waiter didnt seem like she was good mood eiether. Last time I will come here, Been coming here for years."}
{"text":"I got the tacos and they were really good, brought my dog and our server gave her a cookie even though she was a bit of a brat that day."}
{"text":"This is by far the best bar in Tempe. They have an amazing selection of beer at a reasonable price and their staff is amazing. It is the best customer service that I have received. Their food is great and it  doesn't take forever to get it."}
{"text":"Primarily a pub and college student hangout. However, everyone was friendly and helpful and the sweet potato tots and thin crust pizza were excellent. Very friendly to bicycle riders. Indoor and outdoor seating. Many choices for beer."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 4 years now and they have grown a lot. Laid back crowd, as many beer choices as yard house but way better prices and unique dishes like dog fish head bruschetta make this place a rare find near the mill / old town area. On a personal note, thanks for continuing to be a member of trade source!"}
{"text":"Met a buddy here for his b-day get-together. They had a decent selection of micro brews, and some good deals for happy hour on beer and some food. Their selections of beer are listed on the wall, so don't try looking for a beer menu.   I had a small pizza, which was pretty decent for the price. Ranger IPA was great, and only $2 for their big one (can't remember the exact size) during happy hour. They were pretty busy, but had a lot of servers working so we were being helped every few minutes. The pub itself is a dive, so if you like dives you'll like this joint."}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointing. First time here. Uninterested and boring staff. Came to watch football playoffs and there was barely any volume so I was able to hear the table behind me chew their food. Seemed like a lot of regulars. Good beers on tap was the only redeeming factor I could find. I ordered the \"Tangy Buffalo\" style of their \"Best Wings\" it came out and I had to send them back because I didn't think there was anything on them except for a pool of grease under them. When they came back they were just a little more doused in greased \"sauce\" than the last but just as flavorless. The waitress did not not seem to care in the least. These were worse than Hooters mild sauce. They need to shape up but because of the good draft lineup I may give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Great place for some killer burgers in a laid-back atmosphere (probably about 70% ASU students to 30% families whilst we were there).  We have driven by this rather ho-hum restaurant countless times, but never thought to venture in (driving by you really would have no idea what kind of restaurant/bar/pub this might be!). Came across a Groupon and decided to give it a shot. Good decision!  We went at about 5:30pm on a Saturday and the place was about half-way full (more so in the bar compared to the \"dining room\").  Walk in, the sign says to seat yourself so we opted for a booth near a wall/window. Here's some advice:  Don't just plunk down in the booth, the seats could use a little TLC- they were rather hard!    Super chill and knowledgable staff; our waiter had great suggestions (we took his advice).  Started with a bruschetta appetizer (pesto, diced chicken, Gouda, basil, fresh tomatoes), which was hella tasty!  Margaritas were perfect blend of flavor and tequila, one is plenty for dinner unless you want to get tossed at 6pm. Followed up with the Moose Drool burger (did I mention that Saturdays are $6 burger or sandwich days, and includes one side?!?) which is a beef burger with provolone, fried onion strings, fried jalapeños and a jalapeño cream cheese.  Yum!    Still had some money to spend so we got their version of a pazookie, which was basically a very greasy, yet somehow still tasty, 9\" freshly-baked cookie.   Bill came to $30, cheap!  Great place, REALLY great value on Saturdays!  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We've been to this location once, when it was an Old Chicago. We finally returned last night (6/17) to follow the Founders Brewing Co tap take over AZ tour. Despite being packed, the service was really good. That's all of the positives I have. It was hotter than heck and there was some serious price gouging going on. We've been to so many tap take overs I've lost count. I can't recall ever paying more than $9 for most of the beers. Boulders took full advantage of having some semi h beers and just marked it up to a deplorable price. $8 for 6.5oz of CBS is significantly higher than I've ever paid. $9 for  less than a full pint of KBS and Big Luscious...... SHAME ON YOU BOULDERS! Take some of your massive profits from last night and pay your a/c bill."}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy boulders, but my last few experiences have not been very pleasant.  The servers there have terrible attitudes, hence the reason I haven't been in a long time.  On my last visit I ordered the California carver pizza (usually very delicious) and I have had it many times.  This last time it was not made correctly so I asked our server (whom is also a bartender) for a side of sauce that is normally drizzled on it, which he replied \"it's mixed in the pizza sauce, I guess I can grab extra\" and proceeded to walk away. We all sat there stunned and asked why we still come here to each other.  Over the attitudes and the food has steadily gone down hill."}
{"text":"Staff is great, food is great, beer selection is super great.  They have PBR in a can every day all day for $1.25.  They have great daily beer and food specials.  The California Carver pizza is super unique and amazing.  Also, it is very bike friendly.  You can bring your bike in and hang it up inside, which is super nice for anyone who actually cares about their bike.  Everyone is super nice, they have tons of seating, tons of TVs with the games on, darts, and pool tables.  They also just added a new outdoor seating area where you can drink.  Trivia night is every Tuesday, and they have great live music every Wednesday.  I am a huge fan, and they deserve your business.  If you like good beer, good food, and good times, this is the bar/lounge/restaurant for you."}
{"text":"This place seems to have a bit of an identity crisis. It is a cross between a dive bar and a gastropub and it just feels a bit off. They have an impressive beer selection and the prices are decent too.   We sat on the patio with nobody else around and our dog was allowed to sit with us, so that is a bonus. Our server even brought out some water for the little guy. The downside is that we were approached a couple of times by people asking for money or food. The last thing I want to do is sit and try to enjoy myself as people repeatedly come up and ask me for handouts, so I knocked a star off for that.   All of the food we had was good but there wasn't anything that I would go out of my way to get. I will probably be back for a drinking lunch someday since I work nearby or to grab a beer that you can't find anywhere else nearby. Bottom line is that I'm neutral on this place - won't avoid it or go out of the way for it."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. We came so close to just walking out and the food was sub par"}
{"text":"Went to Boulders this afternoon for Happy Hour.  The bar is a cool location and atmosphere with a great beer selection. I look forward to going back and trying more of there menu and drinks."}
{"text":"Everything went right with my experience at Boulders on Broadway.   Came in late evening on a Sunday, was able to seat ourselves in a spacious booth in a more quite corner of the pud, and was promptly greeted by our server.   The place was clean, well-lit (but not oppressively so), and the atmosphere was positive and upbeat. I loved how happy everyone was, and it was clearly a place for having a good time.   Our server was hilarious (almost crying at a couple of points) and he definitely made the night extra memorable. He was quick to top off our water, and made sure we were taken care of without being obnoxious. Kudos.  The food was excellent, making this my new favorite late-night stop for good ol' fashioned bar food. My wife and I split their Nachos Grande and it was amazing. Generous portion size, with all of the favorite toppings. They were baked in the oven to perfection and we scarfed them down with the help of our friend without even looking up.   I ordered the Elvis Calzone and was impressed. Cooked to a perfect golden brown, and stuffed with mozzerella, red bell peppers, and capers (normally comes with canadian bacon but I took the vegetarian route). Came with a huge side of house marina and it was hands down one of the best calzones I have ever had. Must try for calzone lovers.   Their beer list was staggeringly large, with every name you can imagine on it, and I was told that it changes daily. I wasn't drinking, so I didn't get to try any of the great selections, but it is definitely the place to be for those looking to try a new brew!!  Over all this place has great food, great service, and a killer atmosphere that makes a five star stop for anyone looking for an exceptional pub experience."}
{"text":"Boulders is a great place to have excellent beers on tap. There are always new beers to try. There is also really good quality food! My boyfriend and I go at least once a week. The staff is very friendly and always attentive. Also, the parking is WAY better than Four Peaks. I would definitely recommend Boulders to anyone. Five stars, no doubt."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat. Food was awesome and a reasonable price. Our sever was so sweet and attentive. I think this is our new Saturday spot."}
{"text":"Calzone was great!  Service good. Place seriously needs a professional cleaning and a facelift."}
{"text":"Around 150 beers... team trivia... no nonsense. A cruisers paradise and and eclectic mix of people. Beer snobs and frat kids alike! You always find something you like with the super knowledgable bartenders/staff, and you will never feel out of place. I love love love this bar. There are different happy hours every night and Team Trivia on Tuesdays  Oh, ps. This is NOT a sports bar... there are handful of older televisions through the place so go to BWW if you're looking for a game."}
{"text":"Boulders is heavily involved in a lot of community events and for that, they have my appreciation.  Their beer selection is excellent, and their food is reasonably good.  However they perpetually under-staff table servers, making for very slow service.  It is not uncommon to wait for 20 minutes for a simple drink order.  I can't speak to bar service, but eating at a table Boulders is an all-evening affair.  It doesn't do a lot of loud music, but it gets crowded at times and the noise level makes it a bit excessive.  Sitting in the upper level is usually quieter.  That said, it is not a bad place.  You could certainly do a good deal worse for bars in Tempe.  They have a good community of cyclists and climbers, and you can often meet interesting people."}
{"text":"PINE NUT BLEU CHEESE SALAD was the BEST salad I've ever had in any restaurant on any of the four continents to which I've traveled. The thinly sliced pears were in perfect harmony with the bleu cheese. The vinagrette added just the right notes of tang and sweetness. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Just touched down to AZ from Cali so finding some good is important to me . After the long drive I took a look at their Happy Hour menu at 11 pm and ordered Unicorn Tears, Onion Rings, 2 diefferent hamburgers fr their menu. Grandma had a side Caesar salad. We all left super full and happy and our this was quenched at this cool hip restaurant.   I yeah cool outside patio! ! Missstyyy!"}
{"text":"This place might have one of the best beer selections at a reasonable price in all of Tempe. Possibly in the East Valley. Their food is great too, service is decent, and the daily specials they offer are just plain awesome!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just wanted somewhere to eat and we didn't know this was more of a dive bar.  We don't really care for beer, so we didn't have any.  When we first got there our hostess sat us at a dirty table.  The menu was dirty as well and there was no menu for beer (which seemed to be their highlight).  Our waitress was the worst of the night.  She had no personality, was rude and didn't understand humor.  All the workers, excpet one, I believe the owner, had no energy.  They looked unhappy and really uncustomer service friendly.  There was also a gross bathroom smell near where we sat in the booth.  Well, past that our food looked good, but tasted pretty much flavorless.  It wasn't really worth the money we paid for it.  We were ignored mostly and any refill, ketchup request seemed like it was too hard of a task.  Learn the hell to smile!  We were so uncomfortable there!  Terrible terrible times more terrible!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and sign up for their loyalty card and not only will you get great happy hour specials but even better specials on top of that. good food and good beers on tap!"}
{"text":"I absolutely can't stand this place, but routinely there are special beer events that cause me to frequent it. Beer selections are great, albeit over priced even for non rare beers. Food is mediocre at best. Service is awful.   My first time there was for a beer event that was very busy and service was lousy. I chalked it up to the event stretching everyone thin.   Came back on a normal night where it wasn't nearly as packed and watched servers stand around neglecting tables all night. Food was cold, but the beer was too.  Came back a few times for rare beers and had the same experience. Today was the last time I think I'll come in even for the special tapings. The manager or owner (don't know which but he is always there) was extremely rude to me when filling my beer and I can only assume it was because I was purchasing a full beer instead of taking part in the beer festival event they had going on at the time. I guess my money for the beer wasn't enough compared to the other patrons."}
{"text":"Visited Boulders again this past Monday to partake of a few craft brews & have a bite to eat.  I had a Stone IPA & a Rogue Dead Guy Ale, both on tap.  I'm told it was the hottest day of the year but it was Bloody uncomfortably Hot inside as well.  Thank god for the cold beer!  We had Italian Nachos, Veggie Style, to match our beers and all was good in the world.  My only complaint was the inside tempature, in the Arizona Heat, this is an important detail! Lets hope they fix this little bug!"}
{"text":"Ok where to start... I come here every week... I love the atmosphere, they offer a great happy hour... the food is really good.... they even have trivia... but the problem is the service with a certain server named (IZAAK) he is very rude, he disrespected me and my whole table and I felt humiliated.. he would whisper under his breath really rude comments.. I really love boulders but he needs to be confronted about this issue and work on his people skills! I might not be returning to boulders...."}
{"text":"Here's the deal.  I'm not even going to review the \"food\".  No.  This is devoted to the fries.  Listen... the food is pretty good.  I could think of some things to do better, but as it stands I would never shy away from an opportunity to eat here.  I fear the sandwiches are being overshadowed by the fries.  Oh... the fries.  Nuggets from God himself.  Nuggets from Allah.  NUGGETS FROM THE BETTER PART OF THE AFTERLIFE! (And if you don't believe in the afterlife, then... uhhh... nuggets from Dawkins?) Seriously.  I long for those fries.  Oh, I had the pizza one time.  It was good.  Not as good as the fries, but... you know, shadow of the colossus syndrome and all... good."}
{"text":"This place doesn't open on time so I can't give it much of a review . I was really excited to try it but got tired of waiting ."}
{"text":"I love this place! We go here about once a paycheck! We bring our kids sometimes and even the mother-in-law a couple of times. This is a great place to meet your friends and hang out. Everything on the menu that I have tried has been great! The Stromboli and the salads are my favs! I've never had to wait to be seated. And the wait staff has always been more than pleasant."}
{"text":"Been going here for years and i can still say I'm a fan.  the ONE thing I don't love is that they don't have beer lists readily available at tables, because they want you to download their app. it's just an extra step that i'm not into at all. if i didn't already have the investment in boulders, it would honestly make me think twice about going there. I'm just not a fan of making that app replace lists at the tables.   other than that, solid atmosphere, decent bar food. I can sincerely say that the quality of service there varies GREATLY from server to server. it seems like some really want their customers to be happy and others just sort of want to make it through the day.   the bartender who i think is named Chris takes his job seriously and always has good recommendations. Also, can't say enough nice things about their waitress Stefanie. I typically try to sit in her section if I can look around and see if she's working. Everyone there is nice and pleasant, I just feel like I get better service from these two in particular.   Tuesday trivia still as fun as ever. Their hot wings are also delicious, though I wish there were a little bit crispier."}
{"text":"I love this place. Been coming here since it was Old Chicago. I miss the 'round the world' beer thing that OC had, but so what... Boulders reminds me of OC but even better. Great food, great staff, a crowd that is a nice mix of students and other folks. A real neighborhood bar with just enough college vibe but not so much that anyone over 30 feels painfully out-of-place. Came in recently with a big group, we sat upstairs and the service was a tad tardy but I completely understood, we didn't realize how big our group would be. They shanghai'd extra wait staff to keep us all happy and I gotta say we WERE happy. Love the big-ass nachos and hell, pretty much everything there.  The only complaint I would ever have about their food, is that recently I had some kind of stuffed burger and the meat just was not cooked thoroughly enough, and it took so long to get my order that I really wasn't about to send it back and wait even longer.  But, hey, shit happens sometimes. This is by far the exception there. I will keep coming back, love ya Boulder's! If only you could open up one by my area of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This place is always so amazing! They let you bring your dog onto he patio. The salmon blt with the waffle fries are on point! Staff is super nice and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Accommodating, Enjoyable, Delicious & Connected.  P.S. Start with their \"Classic Bar Stuff\" (Fried zucchinni, cheese curds, onion strings  & wings); then fill up on the Moose Drool Burger! Thanks Erick"}
{"text":"There are so many things right about this place it should be wrong. The heaters outside for the patio area are even fantastic. I went on Halloween this year, and everyone was dressed up, it was quite amusing. The building appears to be built into the side of a hill, so there aren't any windows, this kinda gives the place a darker- shadier feel. However, their alcohol and beer selection is pretty amazing. The person I was with was pretty impressed, and I've had friends talk about this place often.   We had hamburgers stuffed with pepperoni, cheese, mushroom, and other pizza toppings. They were a bit dry, but still delicious, I recommend trying one of the burgers, for sure. The burchetta was by far the best appetizer I've had in a long time. The guy taking our order disappeared a few times, so it took us a long time to get our check and food, but if you're having drinks that won't be noticeable."}
{"text":"All around great experience, great atmosphere, and great food. I had the Carver burger, solid choice, great amount of spice and a great amount of all around flavor. If you are looking for a place to get some solid bar food then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Best part: loved the beer list. Lots of delicious and unique craft brews. Looks like there are some great brewery events here, signed up for the email list and hoping to catch a few. We were here late on a busy Friday night with a group of six. There was one table left that we were able to squeeze around. We ordered some late night food - sandwiches, burgers, nachos, sweet potato tots. We all felt like the food was fine, but just fine. Everything could have been a little better. Our friend's burger was ordered med-rare and wasn't really pink at all. The breakfast menu looks pretty promising. I guess we'll have to try some food here during regular meal hours. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. A lot of beers on tap and good food. Went on a Saturday and they have a great food deal and drink specials!"}
{"text":"Amazing selection of beer! Good specials, too. I was able to find my favourite Maui Brewing Company Mana Wheat here which made my day! The food is very good and portions are more than ample so you can easily split something or just have a lunch for yourself the next day. Service is really friendly and the vibe in here is really relaxed and fun. I came in after a race and didn't feel at all out of place in my racing gear and all sweaty and tired. My new favourite post-race place!"}
{"text":"Went to Boulders tonight.  Put 5 dollars in the jukebox, requested 4 songs.  Bartender skipped every single one of them.  If you don't want your customers to play music, don't have a jukebox."}
{"text":"I wish there was a setting for ZERO stars, as this place fits the bill big time. Handedly the worst service I've ever had. As briefly as possible, I ordered food for delivery. 90 minutes later it wasn't here so I finally called (should have earlier). The employee told me she didn't take my order so she couldn't help me, and she then hung up...seriously?! I then called back, and asked for the manager, and the same employee said she was the manager and couldn't help me, then she hung up again.  So I called a 3rd time and demanded to speak with the real manager.  Surprisingly, or not, the manager then treated me the same way. My food finally showed up as I was on the phone with the manager, 100 minutes after I ordered. Because it got there, the manager refused to refund me, and refused to acknowledge that her superbly sub-par employee was out of line.  No person should ever, ever hang up on a customer, period.  Oh, and the food was also sub-par.  Avoid at all costs. I wish this experience on no one, even the orange haired guy."}
{"text":"Boulders is one of my favorite lunch spots during the week- it's close enough I can get there during my lunch hour, and not very busy at that time of day so we can get our food quickly.  I get the Honey BBQ Chicken Salad (with no onions! ...no onion?) every time.  My coworkers have ordered a variety of different lunches, and gave two thumbs up to those too.  They have a large beer selection for my beer-drinking friends and really tasty root beer for me!  I haven't been for happy hour or at night for drinks, but I'd like to!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable place. No frills, very comfortable place to hang out. Good food and a great beer list.  Outdoor seating if you're in that mood, lots of TVs inside for sports. Great service. Why wouldn't you come to Boulders on Broadway."}
{"text":"Great staff and food and drinks but always hot inside. If you haven't had them the crispy artichokes are awesome!! Fans or extra cooling could help a lot in the bar area."}
{"text":"I give Bonnie G full credit for me reviewing this place, for there'd be no way in hell I'd have seen it or known about it otherwise. I'm trying to remember why we went. Somehow I was in Tempe. Bonnie was in Tempe. Why were we both in Tempe? Who knows. You don't care either way.  The point is, walking into Boulders was a little bizarre. It's completely out of place for the area. More like an old college institution you'd find in Chico or Corvallis. Or maybe even Flag. Big, huge, bike-friendly wooden ski lodge. Upstairs loft with pool-table overlooking the bar/restaurant below. It is pretty much the quintessential neighborhood hangout. No scene. No pretense. No slathering your fake-n-bake and hair gel to mack on Landon and Tiffany. Extremely casual and everyone's friendly - from the owner to all the other patrons.   And did I mention the beer? An impressive selection of microbrews on tap, many of which I'd never heard of. But the owner took the time to describe each one, and I ended up with a few pints of a really great stout (Bonnie was quite taken with her brew as well). The beers regularly rotate, so there's always something new to try.  And sure, there is mostly noise coming out of the jukebox, but I didn't really care. It's not like I was expecting to hear some European DJ who has at least one umlaut in his name and wears wraparound shades even while he's spinning in a pitch black nightclub. You're here for the conversation (unless you're a Woo Girl).  So all in all, I really dug this Boulders, in all its sheer normalness. We all need a place like this: a super-casual neighborhood bar which requires the least amount of effort from you. Sitting on your living room couch and feel like having a beer with a friend without needing to put on \"going out\" attire and \"going out\" attitude? This is it. Your shoulders are down. You're chilled out. And you're probably discovering a new favorite beer in the process.  4 stars."}
{"text":"This used to be my and my boyfriend's favorite local spot. Then they changed their menu, their all-day happy hour schedule, and we haven't seen our favorite server in a month. They took away their best burger, the Tatonka, their best appetizer, the Buffalo Chicken Dip, and one of their best sandwiches, the Ro' Diddy. They also changed all-day happy hour from Saturday to Sunday. Before this, they took away my favorite breakfast item from weekend brunch, which was this great twist on scrambled eggs on a hot dog with bacon, green peppers and jalapeño cream. It was called the Hangover Man's Best Friend that went really well with sweet potato tots. Then we never saw Izaak after all these changes took place. The new servers didn't take the time to get to know us like Izaak did. It's unfortunate. I took away a star for every item they took off, +1 for being awesome before all these changes, and +1 because Izaak was/is the best. Our last hope was the sister restaurant on Southern, Boulders on Southern, but alas, to no avail. They had the same changes. Our tradition must now change, and we are seeking a new local spot."}
{"text":"After climbing at AZR last night, Taylor and I were deciding where to get our drink on...  We jetted down to Boulders for wings, good beer (Arrogant Bastard) and pool.  This place is so hip to the outdoor life that they have Climbing mags to read while waiting for the food to arrive!  Any bar that has Dogfish Head, Chimay, and Moose Drool is a winner in my book.  Even saw Yelp royalty here, Taylor F. was lounging with Jen and Tim!   I will be back.....  Oh, and it is definitely the place for shorts and flip-flops on a Friday night!  One last note - great jukebox..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and one of my favorite places to drink and eat. Boulders has awesome customer service with a great vibe.  I had ordered delivery one night through Tempe takeout and Tempe takeout decided to cancel my order 40 minutes after being placed because they did not have a driver in the area.   I called Boulders explaining what happened and spoke to a manager. Boulders told me they could have my food ready in less then 10 minutes if i wanted to pick it up.  Went to Boulders with my order ready to go and half off my bill because Tempe takeout screwed up. Thank you Boulders!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Ordered a bacon cheese burger medium rare more rare. Add onions & mushrooms. Came super well done like crispy bacon only no bacon. Onions had breading on them and no mushrooms but jalapeno peppers instead. Trying to not complain I asked for mushrooms. (I forgot the bacon). Mushrooms came after 15 minutes. I picked off all the peppers. Took one bite but it was saturated in jalapeno pepper juice so I went discretely and told the manager. All he offered was to delete the sandwich from the bill but no offer to make me another. The water tasted like unfiltered crap Arizona tap water. I could not drink it.  I paid for my beer and left and went somewhere else to eat. Never again. Avoid this place. Food & service is terrible."}
{"text":"Boulders is great! So many craft beer options on tap and tasty food! :)"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer!  The selection is fabulous. The staff is kind aloof but friendly.  The atmosphere is very casual, relaxed and kinda hippie.  I've been twice. The first time was on a Saturday night. The place was packed for trivia and emptied out quickly after the game.  I shared the honey chicken sandwich with a friend and it was quite good. The waffle fries were delish too.  The second time was a Sunday afternoon for the all you can eat one topping pizzas for $7 per person. I got green chilies as my topping and loved it. It the pizza gourmet? No. Is it a great pizza for the price? Yes! I powered my way through 1 1/2 pizzas and took home the leftovers.  Make sure you bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"Great place to chill after work and take back a few amazing beers with your friends. They have a great selection of craft beers on tap and bottled. There's definitely a lot I'll need to try. The staff is friendly and their happy hours are generous. I'd recommend it easily."}
{"text":"Okay, okay...so, we went back, and we were convinced. A couple friends and I were looking for a place to watch Sunday football, and we came here for the first games of the season. It was a quiet morning, but probably just because it was the first game. It has definitely picked up since then.  Justin, the Manager, was kind enough to lure us back with an offer to try the California Carver pizza. Hooked! ! Comes with a spicy southwest sauce, turkey, pepper jack & mozzarella, then topped with pico, avocado & crisp onion strings. You won't be sorry you tried it. We went back the following week and ordered the same thing!  We've gone back a couple times now and it feels like we're visiting with old friends when we come in. Justin, the bartender, is a riot and knows how to keep his customers smiling even when he's got a full bar - plus it helps he's also rooting for DaBears!   The service really has been excellent, everyone is on top of things and makes sure we have everything we need. They probably don't remember this, but I also hosted a dinner for my Meetup group in the private room upstairs a few months ago, and we had great service then too. I was just so busy entertaining, that I didn't get a chance to really talk to the staff that night...but we'll probably host another event here soon!  Thanks Justin1 for convincing us we needed to come back, and Justin2 for making it fun to stay. See you for the next Bears game! ;)"}
{"text":"I went here one weekday night with my team from work, and it was alright. We had a big group and ended up sitting outside, which was nice during the time of the year that we went. The drinks were fine. The service was fine. The food was fine. I guess I could see the colorado-y charm during the brief moment I stepped inside. It had a very lodge-y feel.   It wasn't very memorable In fact, I hadn't though about this place until I was searching on yelp for restaurants. I probably wouldn't go back especially since there are places like Four Peaks and Cornish Pasty nearby."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I received an apology from the owner regarding the salad error. I will be returning to give Boulders another shot.  -The \"Pizza Nuggets\" are just a cut up cheese pizza. Not a big fan. Kinda doughy.  -Ordered the California Carver Burger which was really good.  -I chose a house salad for my side with the burger, which was on the list of options along with the waffle fries and caesar salad.  However, when my bill came I was charged $3.50 for the salad, which is the full price for the house salad. I didn't receive any other side with my burger and, after double checking the menu, no where did it say anything about an extra charge for a salad. I'm not someone who makes a fuss, especially over $3.50, but when I asked the waiter about it his response didn't make any sense. All he said were things like \"the manager makes us do that\" and \"it's so stupid\" and that \"the caesar salad doesn't come with an extra charge, but the house does.\" He did end up taking it off, but the fact he made up a bunch of excuses that didn't make sense left us all confused.  Enjoy the good food, but be sure to review your check carefully!!"}
{"text":"As you can see from my check-ins, I have become a regular @ BOB.  They have greatly improved on their service (much appreciated)!  My friends and I have returned multiple times for their nachos and pizza! I also have ventured out and tried their Tree Huggin' Veg Head and Spinach Artichoke Calzone - all good.  Make sure you catch Happy Hour during the week to take advantage of their drink and appetizer specials! They have Wi-Fi and the music they play is also really good! SOLID! :)"}
{"text":"It's definitely a locals hang & the beers are cold & are cheap anytime of the day. Gotta love that! If you're looking for some amazing fare or to hook up with someone avoid this place because the food in my opinion looked meh & the peeps were very chill. Not a Tempe meat market & I love that!"}
{"text":"Great food, good deals, amazing beer. Be sure to come early on trivia nights (Tu, Sa, Su)"}
{"text":"What's not to love about Boulders? Cool, friendly staff. Dozens of craft beers - importantly coupled with some true, in-house expertise on the subject. Great food, especially the pizza. Excellent weekly specials. Prime location with plenty of parking.  And, of course, there's...The Big Freakin' Nacho.   The BFN is truly the most unusual, potentially frightening and ultimately satisfying nacho-type dish I have ever utterly failed to finish, even with the assistance of multiple friends. It is served on a pizza platter.  A LARGE pizza platter. Enough calories to support a small Eurasian village through a long winter. And, oddly but pleasantly, the chips are made from fried pizza dough, and marinara has been subbed in for salsa.    An experience worth having."}
{"text":"Service is bogus!  Although Boulders has a decent beer selection, they present their drawls in a difficult fashion. Who advertises their selection through a time lapse television screen?!  The food was sub par at best. I find this place to be a disgrace to nachos (haha). Add chicken? Ask first. The menu price is less than is charged. I spoke to the manager (who we all thought was a server in training) after they tried to swindle us and were told \"We are waiting on new menus. Next time you will be charged the full amount.\" Wtf? Charge the prices that you have listed on your menu or.... Well, you're a dick.   The vibe of the place seems legit. I just wish they ran a good show."}
{"text":"Okay, so a group of us go out practically every Friday to the same old places for beer and food, but mostly for beer. So to break out of the norm, I was in search of a place with excellent beer and good food and somewhat close to home. So onto Yelp I go and came upon Boulders, and the reviews were pretty good and definitely worth checking out. So we all pack into the car and head over to Boulders. The parking is great, plenty of spaces to go around. You walk through the patio, not bad with all the misters, felt like I was in a rainforest, but very refreshing. So you walk a little further, watch the steps, and there's your bar. Very open, plenty of hightop tables and lots of TV's. The beer menu was plentiful. It should make everyone from the microbrewer to the coors drinker happy. I was pleased because they had plenty of vegetarian meals, or dishes you can substitute meat for veggies... and for you meat eaters out there, I was told the burgers were delicious and the waffle fries were soooo tasty. The staff was helpful and attentive as well. I would definitely add this into our Friday night rotation. If you're looking for microbrews, this is a place to check out. The atmostphere is kicking and just an all around good place to kick back."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for riding a bike to and grabbing a bite and few beers. I love that they have indoor bike racks viewable from the bar; a perfect feature for people like me who always forget my lock.   They have pretty fantastic drink specials and a solid craft beer list. All September they're doing $3 Oskar Blues cans. They also do all day happy hour on Saturday's, half price pizza on Monday's, and Trivia Night on Tuesday's & Sunday's.   I can't say the food is anything worth writing home about, but for what they offer they do it well & the service has always been great. All around a good place!"}
{"text":"As we arrived I noticed a catering truck with the Boulders on Broadway AND \"Spokes\" restaurant written across it.  Since we've not had great experiences at Spokes we said \"Let's just hope this place is better\" as we walked in BonB.  'Ordered boneless chicken wings and wound up with deep fried (we expected grilled), that with at least half of the wings being mostly fried breading...ugh.  'Also ordered a Swiss Mushroom burger/medium - came out well done and the meat didn't taste fresh.  I'm surprised there are numerous good comments about the burgers here. The piped in music (from a radio station), was annoying - too loud and not clear. What I can give a good review on is our waitress. We'll not give this place another chance."}
{"text":"This place has a great beer selection and good specials like half off bottled beers on Thursdays if u are a club member... Do it, register its easy! The food is your typical bar fare. They have their version of a pizza cookie (half bake topped with ice cream) not nearly as good as the original from Oregano's... Sorry I name dropped. Over all great location, younger college crowd, laid back atmosphere, and really good service!"}
{"text":"Good stuff...typically go here after a Phoenix hike!!  Creative menu items at a good price.  Plenty of sports on the TVs!!"}
{"text":"Boulders on Broadway has been one of my infrequent go-to's ever since moving to the Tempe area about two years ago. It's a very consistent experience, albeit a somewhat expected one.  The beer menu is pretty good - not great, but better than other bars in the area. The menu is also pretty good - plenty of yummy options, nothing necessarily earth-shattering.  My typical order is the California Carver Burger, which is always really tasty, and my FAVORITE thing about the place is that they serve DELICIOUS waffle fries. can't get enough go those!  Service is always also \"just ok\". Nothing to write home about in all the times I've been there, although certainly acceptable. Everyone's typically pretty busy, to be honest.  The ambiance is nice for a bite to eat or to grab a drink with a friend, but I never bother bringing my laptop or anything - there are better bars (and coffee shops!) for that.  The one minor complaint I have about Boulders is that waiter service can sometimes be outrageously slow. Getting your food: can also sometimes be unbelievably slow.  The only reason I make mention of this is so that you don't expect to squeeze a \"quick lunch\" in if you're on the clock. You'll likely go over (been there, done that, I'm afraid...).  Overall, I'd give Boulders on Broadway 3 stars. BUT... Because they serve those tantalizing waffles fries that keep me coming back... I'm happy to give them 4 stars instead.  :)"}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday and had an AMAZING meal!!!  I went for a work meeting and between the two of us, we tried: the pulled pork sandwich, the bacon cheeseburger, the waffle fries, and the jalapeno cheese tots.  I cannot say enough how delicious this all was!!!  The pulled pork was great, loved the slaw and pickles.  The waffle fries were crispy and delicious!  The bacon on the cheeseburger was amazing!  But most of all, the tots!!  OMG the tots!!  If I hadn't been there for work, I would have taken pics.  It was great.  Service was also fast and stellar, our server was awesome.  The beer menu was incredibly impressive, so had it been after 5pm, I would have had a different time  All in all, great bar food and drinks...highly recommend...will definitely be back.   Side note:  the door is on the side of the building"}
{"text":"Very good Music, good atmosphere for family conversations had the BBQ chicken Salad awsome Meal with my family visiting from out of Town,"}
{"text":"The food here was really good, and you really need to take them seriously when they say \"Big Frickin' Nachos\". Those things were huge! 4 of us couldn't even put down before we got the entres. The only thing I didn't like about the place was the service time. It took a while to get drink refills and we were waiting for the check for too long."}
{"text":"The food was okay but our server, Izaak, was incredibly rude to us. We caught him whispering mean comments behind our backs and even as we were leaving the restaurant. We saw him treat the other tables fine but I guess he just didn't like us.  It made our experience incredibly uncomfortable and we don't plan on going back there again."}
{"text":"Oh Boulders,  you have made me proud. handsome Dave turned it all around for me and i come weekly with a group of hungry, thirsty ladies for our official \"meetings\".  From Addya to Dave to Poopsie to Amy, we just keep gettin it good and keep comin back. Your food runner is top notch and a great idea! The mgr (I think) comes out to show us baby pics as if we were part of the Boulders fam even if we dont climb or ride. The patrons have become less, erm, gangstah and more neighborhood. I am so pleased this neighborhood cove found its way to realizing the fortune this hood can provide, given the right prices, decent food, a chill patio and good service. I could see Boulders expanding that patio and raking it in, should the city be as kind as to let them. One thing- chilly months? Do away with the cool, fancy looking heaters that dont work and do more with the other version. The fire pit is a great touch but it runs out often. Other than that, I hope you appreciate how amazing your core staff is. They are largely why we keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer of Boulders on Broadway for 4+ years.  Over that time, my friends and I developed relationships with the wonderful servers there, who always remembered our names, our favorite dishes, and who were always willing to recommend a great new beer from the extensive, ever changing list.  In the past year or so, however, this place has gone downhill fast.  The online beer list never matches the beers on the chalkboard, so it's hard to order without checking with your server about what's ACTUALLY going to be on tap.  They also no longer have prices posted, so more than once I have been surprised by ordering a \"premium\" beer when no indication of this was given on the menu.  Unfortunately, in our past 3 visits, we've sat for 15-20 minutes before actually being visited by a server.  On one occasion this summer, I found a fly in my salad.  Their employee turnover has also been unreasonably high as of late...gone are those friendly servers who remembered our names and made us feel welcome.  In the past year, we've had a different server on every visit, and every time they seemed brand new (didn't know the beer list, forgetting our order, etc.).  The final straw was that in our last two visits, the servers have been not only incompetent but downright rude, even insulting people at our table to our faces.  Sorry Boulders...based on our history, I've given you too many chances.  No more."}
{"text":"Went their while my car was being fixed. Asked for what beers were on tap but was told they were on the wall, do descriptions of the beer. TV's are small. Ordered the wings off the appetizer menu and had them with buffalo-tangy sauce. Probably thee worst wings I've ever had. Sauce was awful, the wings sat in its own grease, I had to remove them from the basket to eat them. I didn't even finish them all. I'll give this place another chance for dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to the Mesa location many times and have been very happy so I tried the Tempe location today when I was in the area.   The service was nice, pleasant, and quick, and the food was decent (but it wasn't hot when it came out). However, the restaurant felt very dirty, which kind of ruined the experience."}
{"text":"I've now been to \"Boulders on Broadway\" twice and think it's definitely worth you checking out.  The first time I came in with my wife, we weren't thrilled with the food, but the second time I came in, I sat at the bar and had the Carver Pizza, which was delicious.  Great service, too.  One huge plus - their prices are GREAT.  The Happy Hour is excellent, and they have Happy Hour ALL DAY on Saturday.  That's insane.  $4 Appetizers and Drinks, not to mention the Burgers and Pizzas are affordable as well.    If you're an ASU student, or really, anyone who wants to find a good deal on food and drinks, and if you like Pub Trivia, then I say...  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend . I was not expecting BEST WINGS EVER!!!!! It is a hipster place with TONS of seating and great burgers and wings. Great service, could be faster offering refill on my drank, but I'm a wee impatient sometimes and it was Thirsty Thursday after all.  They have private room for parties  and many craft brews of every sort.  Bike and car parking and pretty fun time."}
{"text":"UPDATE:   I received a very friendly message from the owner of Boulders, who apologized for my previous experiences with the food, and offered a free meal with recommendations. Instead of using the free offer from the kind owner, I went back to the restaurant and ordered BOTH of the suggestions that he had: The Asian Bob burger, and the California Carver pizza.  The burger was incredibly juicy and had a nice balance of sweet and savory. Two thumbs up.  The pizza was a crazy amalgamation of all that is yummy: Pepperjack cheese, onion strings, pico de gallo, turkey breast. The serving size was more than adequate for a single person and the taste was great!   Add these two great menu choices with the endless (and ever changing) beer selection, and Boulders on Broadway is a hit!"}
{"text":"A rare treat . . . the new weekend only breakfast at Boulders On Broadway . . . 9am-Noon.  A small menu, but interestingly thought out.  They need to get it up on their website and highlight it!  I'll be back to try the others . . . the Chuck Norris looks good, and I've heard evangelical things about something involving a hot dog . . .  but I've had the Arizona French Toast. Longboards of french toast baugette with candied jalepenos, powdered sugar.  Comes with AZ honey, but I got syrup instead, and added a side of bacon.  Add Four Peaks Brewery's Hop Knot IPA in a frozen glass. Fantastic. The candied jalepenos . . . sweet with plenty of heat, seems wrong but it was SO right . . . I believe I'm ruined for any other french toast"}
{"text":"If you like Trivia nights and a wide beer selection this place is for you.  If you hate Trivia nights and want a fancy drink this place isn't for you.    The food that we get there are usually the burgers and fries which are great.  The pizza isn't too bad and recommend the thin crust over any of the thicker pizzas.    I recommend the SW Chicken Quesadilla and it is somewhat spicy.  The steak sandwhich is literally the best sandwhich I've ever had and my wife agrees.   The salads are hit or miss; I've had one good salad and two pretty horrible iceberg lettuce based ones so avoid the salads as they always seemed a little wilted.    Go there if you have a party of about 5 max as its kinda hard to find seating during Trivia nights.  I hosted my birthday there sometime ago and rented out the upstairs.    To sum up: great location; great people and great bar.  It would get a 5th star if their upstairs was more developed and they hosted real, live music instead of the brutal jukebox."}
{"text":"So to start off, I'd like to speak only about my experience, not the quality of food or service... Wow.. It almost became funny how bad the jukebox selections were..we had 2 females wearing red bandanas and cut offs choosing axial rose and Bon jovi songs for 2 hours.. Jesus help me, then the food came., blah. Wings should be bomb where there is beer. Instead they were just coated in a very strange sweet ketchup sauce they called honey BBQ. I tried this place only because it was 11pm n still serving.. I'll eat cereal next time.."}
{"text":"We live very close to this place, and have considered it a few times just never committed until the other day. I got the groupon (pay $13, get $25) and the 5 of us went in. It was empty on a Saturday afternoon. LOTS of seating inside. From the look of the outside I was nervous it'd be kind of gross inside, but it's not. Could use some updates, but it's clean. Service was friendly, although our waitress wasn't overly knowledgable about their beer selection.   You MUST get the nachos. OMG - so delicious. The chips must be deep fried so they're almost like wantons. SO good!! The pizza wasn't that great, doughy, so I'd try something different next time/wouldn't recommend that. They have waffle fries and tots to choose from! Burgers looked good, same with the sandwiches. LOTS of menu choices so you won't go hungry :-)"}
{"text":"Pizza was great. Bike friendly. Service was fast and efficient.  We arrived midday which is not the best time to miss the cleaning crews, but the pizza lived up to its reputation.  I'd come back here for the bar meets 1970's fern pizza joint meets bicycle shop ( for the racks indoors, not that it has a service shop ).  My father-in-law loved the place which is a hard thing to compliment positively about eating out.  Maybe it was the Tempe heat that helped him mellow out."}
{"text":"I love love love boulders on broadway!!! I'm from out of town and visiting and came twice cuz I loved it so much. Food was pretty good and bartenders were awesome. Came on a tuesday.Trivia night and definitely gonna come during trivia night next time we're in town. Such a great vibe and awesome down to earth people. Love tempe and love boulders on broadway!"}
{"text":"Great spot to chill.  This bar has really good bar food options. From meat lovers to vegetarian.  Happy hour from 3-7pm (if I remember correctly)  They have tables inside and an outside patio.  Beer selection is really good. They got delicious IPA selection. (Don't be shy, ask servers for recommendations)  Place in general has almost daily events such as sports watching or even trivia night. Fun fun!   Great place to chill for few hours and forget about the scorching heat that our lively city has."}
{"text":"LARGE beer selection and a delicious, eclectic menu.  Staff is friendly and knows the menu as well as the tap selection.  One of my favorite spots in the valley.  Great standing daily specials.  Great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, although if you're going for lunch on a weekday, chances are you won't be able to sample any of the beers :("}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now for tempe chamber events. They have some yummy sandwiches for lunch, got to try a couple chicken ones and a roast beef. They have an extensive selection of local beers! The upstairs area is good for small groups but a gets a little warm in the summer. downstairs is nice though with plenty of tv's."}
{"text":"Good lunch place, friendly staff.  Our group tried a few different things - burgers, club sandwich, pizza, and all had good experiences.  It's not amazing, but it's certainly reliable, and has plenty of choices, so it's good for a large group."}
{"text":"Food here is good. Variety of selections, but word to the wise, don't get the salad. I don't think it's very fresh.  Pizzas are where it's at here, and sometimes this place has a Groupon offering online.  Beers are to be expected. Go!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. I had the salmon blt and my husband had the gigantic nachos delivered. Delivery was prompt but most importantly the food was good. The salmon blt had a yummy creamy spicy pesto and the nachos were so light and crispy! We also had the apple cobbler delivered but haven't tried it yet. However it looks yummy. Will order again.  3.5 - I did and it wasn't that great. The bbq mahi mani salad had what they called bbq sauce but was more like a too tangy catalina dressing. The salad had water in it probably from not draining the black beans correctly. Pretty tasteless and now I have a stomach ache."}
{"text":"Beer selection was large, but not with a large variety of beer types, I had a the tough time picking, since the beer type was not listed.   The calzone was respectable beer fair and a nice distraction as I watched sports.    Stop by if you are rolling on two wheels instead of four and  looking for the game and brewskies, not so worth while  for strictly a beer refill.    Review to be updated after trivia night with some friends."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on bringfido.com. The food and the service was excellent. They brought out our dog bowl of ice. We will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"Okay, I love this place. And it's not just because it's where I met my fiance 3 years ago lol  This place is sorcery. A melting pot of so many different concepts that you wouldn't think work together, but strangely, just do.  Boulders is awesome for people of all ages, and that's a really delicate and impossible to maintain balance you won't see elsewhere. Young people, middle aged people, some seniors, the occasional child... It may sound like a mess but it truly just works. And when you're here, youre so busy enjoying yourself you forget the people around you. What I'm saying is unless you're looking for a clubby scene, this place is for anyone and everyone, and is a great place to meet new people, make interesting conversations with strangers, and leave with new friends.  Boulders has Atmosphere with a capital A. Not quite divey, kind of like a lodge sort of feel, like something you would find up in flagstaff. It's also somewhere you can go in jeans and a t-shirt and feel fine about that, or if you wanna dress swanky chic with a full face, it just works.. They also cater alot to outdoorsy vocations like biking, climbing, etc. For example, there's a bike bar inside. Evenings and weekends are great! They have trivia night, which is always well-attended and a great time. Friday's and weekends have a nice comfortably busy volume, and weeknights still have a comfortable amount of people.  They have private \"party\" rooms, all kinds of different types of sections and seating, and a huge private loft great for get togethers and casual events and parties.  They do events which are super cool and fun, the bartenders and servers dress up for Halloween, tour de fat, and other occasions.  They also have tons of games behind the bar, which is a fun an whimsical touch. Things like jenga, monopoly, battleship, etc. Heck yeah, fun hahahaha Their patio is great for just hanging out with friends, talking and relaxing over some great drinks and food. It has an art Deco fire pit, bags, misters, mood lighting, and plenty of seating with umbrellas and space heaters in the winter. Patio is smoker AND dog friendly!  The drinks are great, the constantly changing beer selection is expansive, impressive, and well priced. I guarantee, Boulders has something for every taste, from the cider fanatic like me, to the beer snob. Mixed drinks are great, too! Cheap, strong, and delicious.  The food is sooooooo stinkin good. Pizzas are huge, full of toppings, and delicious. (can I recommend the Chuck Norris double deckered with the California carver?!) Oh man, and their waffle fries and bar foods? So. Good.  They also have tvs all over with various games on, and movie nights, yet somehow that doesn't detract from the \"Lodge feel\" sorcery!  They have a special brunch menu on weekends, with, get ready, phenomenal house recipe bloody Mary's from scratch, no cheap mix here, friend! Don't be thrown off by the dated looking brunch menu, it's looks that way for a reason: the breakfast foods are delicious and have lasted the years.  Last thing, the STAFF IS AMAAAAAAZING. When you come here more than a few times, you feel like family. They see you, know you, remember you. They will shoot the moo poo with you, and it's not unusual to make friends with them outside of Boulders, because they're just cool people. And let me ask you, how many bars do you know of with an ever changing beer list that see you walk in, and based off your past selections and knowing what you like, will have your beer waiting for you when you get to the bar? And even more, it's something you haven't tried before but LOVE? That is Boulders service. Like the aforementioned cider aficionado? That's me. I'm also a wierdo and drink anything carbonated through a straw, beer and cider included. I walk up to the bar and if they arent already filling my glass before popping in my requisite straw, it's there waiting with straw dancing in the bubbles. When I bring new people and we sit inside, I don't have to even say my order they always smile and say whatever the current cider best suited to me is. I know I've waxed eternal on anticipated orders and ciders with straws, but you just don't find that anywhere. A few months ago, I came in one night after receiving 2 extractions, 7 fillings, and, same day, got braces. Yes I'm insane. Deal with it lol moving along, I was ravenous, but in a hell of a lot of pain and couldn't eat. My server (shout out to you Addya!) brought me soup and an amazing assortment of things she thought I could eat. Things like pineapple, olives, cooled soft cooked chicken, various pizza toppings, etc. Not gonna lie, I cried. But that's just how the staff here is. They're awesome.   This place is life, and I will be a patron til this business ceases to exist."}
{"text":"First and last time i go into this place...  Let me say first that I have always wanted to come here just to have a sit down with friends and drinks, but it so happens my son and I walked in one day after a busy day of errands.  I did not want to cook and it was on our way home.  I was disappointed right off the bat because we sat down and I don't know what, because it was just me and my son, but no one wanted the table, (I know how it is, i used to wait tables) but we waited patiently and after about 10 minutes server came over and said he did not see us and apologized.  More than likely taking a smoke break due to he smelled like smoke.  We ordered nachos and cheese sticks, (weren't very hungy) and they were fine.  My complaint to this place would be that I went to ask if they had SunBru from Four Peaks and in Tempe you should be carrying FourPeaks anything at all times, in my opinion!  The server I asked said yes they had it and then my server came back to get my drink order. I asked and he said he would check and came back and said infact no they did not have it.  I settled for an FP 8th street Ale.  The server seemed nervous checking on us, not sure was that was about but he rarely came by, my son was never offered a refill on his drink and I was not offered another beer... seemed weird for a bar... anyway we waited about 10 minutes for the check and when we walked out after completing the transaction, no one said a word to us.  Very strange place.  I can see the neighborhood bar attraction and I wish it was different but I will not set foot in this place again.  Will stick with the ol standby, Four Peaks and never stray again!"}
{"text":"We came in at 12:30 on a Friday. The bartender, who was our server too, was pretty knowledgeable about her beers and drinks. We ordered a roast beef au jous dip, pear quesadilla and BBQ wings. The food was mediocre. The au jous was thin, the roast beef was pretty bland. The pear quesadilla was good, didn't have the oomph we were looking for. The wings were terrible. An odd flavored BBQ sauce, they weren't crispy. We didn't have a long wait for food or drinks though! That's good. And the waffle fries are great.  Overall, I'd probably only come back for drinks."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and love how they can do so many different types of food and they all taste so good. One of my favorites is the waffle fries with their homemade blue cheese dressing. That dressing is amazing! Their salads are great, burgers are so tasty and the service is great! I like their specials also, we try to plan our visits around what special they are running."}
{"text":"Good late night spot. Out of towners with two kids and environment was good for us for late night snack. Better than Denny's"}
{"text":"If your into all types of beers, this is the place for you. I came to eat and socialize with a group of friends. Everyone was raving about the food , I ordered a calzone, I wasn't blown away by it, it was very good tho. The presentation of everyone else' s meal was appealing, but they came for the drinks , and then dinner. Lot of unusual items on the menu, so don't expect the ordinary . As  for me, I  like more of the traditional Italian, and I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"Been searching high and low for a good meaty wings and found the best here for the value and the amount."}
{"text":"Came here after work on Monday for a drink. We were pleasantly surprised at the special, 1/2 off pizza, and decided to get one even though we weren't really planning on eating.  The menu had a great variety - lots of specials and build your own. They also offer thin crust and deep dish in sizes from 9\" (personal) to 14.\" We hadn't had deep dish in a while, so we went for King of Hearts deep dish. It had spinach, artichokes, tomatoes, cheese and amazing sauce. It was nothing short of amazing.  The beer list is solid as well. The staff was cool and the vibe on a Monday night was very laid back. All in all, it was a great time. Highly recommend Boulders on Monday for 1/2 off pizza!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. Spacious enough to bring your friends, but sometimes a bit too spacious - I had trouble finding where they were and the wait staff couldn't help! Also, waiter did not check in with us as often as we would have liked, maybe due to how spread out all of the customers were. Team trivia is fun here! Great happy hour/appetizers."}
{"text":"I happened on Boulders after Four Peaks was mysteriously closed.  I haven't been this underwhelmed in a while.  As far as the interior of Boulders, there was much to like: a bar area, a restaurant area, a second floor with pool table, a Christmas tree with beer can ornaments, and a outside patio.  The menu was normal bar far with an emphasis on their pizzas.  So I went for a pizza.  I chose the California Clutter or something like that.  It had onion rings, avocado, lots of cheese, and was supposed to have turkey.  Instead I got peppers in place of meat.  The deep dish was quite weaksauce in terms of the thickness of its crust.  It was more like a pyramid of crackers.  Though in the end, the pizza was decent.  My friend and I split an order of garlic cheese bread (what I had been craving at Four Peaks) and it was decent though the marinara sauce that came as a side looked like it came from a can.  Then there was the service.  We never got napkins or silverware until I finally asked for a fork towards the end of my meal.  There's no host stand, so you have to seat yourself (a sign would have been nice to indicate that this was the case).  We were supposed to get plates for our garlic bread, but those never materialized.  I guess if you look it as a bar and lower your standards for the food and the service, then you could be content.  However, I have enjoyed delicious food and had great service at bars in the Valley, so I can't."}
{"text":"Great for small to large parties. You can have the entire upstairs area, back room or sunken dining room. Just call ahead and give them a few days notice. Dog friendly patio at all hours. Burgers and sandwiches are pretty good. Please be respectful of those trying to play bar trivia."}
{"text":"Always like going here. I have never had any complaints on their food. They also have a fiod beer selection."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place has a 4 star rating?? We went for trivia night on a Sunday which was lackluster with a dead crowd. Do NOT get the artichoke dip, it was god awful like someone made mash potatoes out of artichokes and substituted gravy for oil on top. Not a fan of this place."}
{"text":"Dont sit in the booth area after 1045p. Apparently that section closes at midnight and one waitress in particular had attitude that we wanted more food"}
{"text":"Perfect place to go if you are looking for a laid back, casual place to enjoy a beer and some good bar food. Came here the other day to play some team trivia and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food. We ordered the boulder nachos as well as a chicken pizza. The boulder nachos were AMAZING, I was a bit scared of the idea of having pepperoni and sausage on my nachos but it was brilliant. The atmosphere is fun and the service was decent. They were out of the cider I wanted but my server was helpful and helping me to choose a new beverage selection. I will come back here often :)."}
{"text":"I have come here for football games on Sunday and my problem is that they don't have enough or for that matter any football specials on food. They have what they always have on Sunday which is all you can eat lousy pizza for $8. They need to have a football menu and another beef is that 3/4 of their appetizers are more expensive than some entrees and sandwiches. The pizza bread junk that we ordered was a dollar more than a turkey sandwich with fries. Oh and that forementioned pizza bread was horrible, literally the chef just cut up one of their junky thin crust pizza's and served it on a plate with marinara sauce. Nothing like the menu description - would have returned it, but shift change left the place devoid of servers right after 1pm football games ended. THey do have a good selection of beers, but the only sunday special is flat glasses of lite beer for $2 which was returned. Also, on this day a tree company (on sunday) was cutting trees on property producing a loud buzzing sound for about an hour. Who cuts trees on Sunday? Service is great though, but be creative with your menu because there are like 100 places that show football around here and most have specials that make the joint worth going to at least."}
{"text":"I had a pizza. It wasn't cooked fully so I sent it back. Manger/Owner personally apoligized.  I got a new one it was perfect. Very tasty but a bit pricey. Monday's are half price Pizza.    I didn't find the place very social and friendly. Seems you come with someone or your on your own even if you are in the bar."}
{"text":"if you've been to this location when it was Old Chicago, it hasn't changed much.  absolutely same decor, same uber selection of beers on tap and in the bottle - they even play bad 90's rock too loud on the jukebox in the bar still. i don't even think they changed the menu...yep, they still serve up their signature italian nachos...  for as college-y sports fan as it kind of seems to be targeted for, it's a pretty normal crowd, like really normal, forgettably normal, and i don't mean that in a crappy way. i used to live right down the way and the roommates and i would head up for a beer or two, reasonably priced bar food (mushroom swiss burgers, pizzas, calzones, appetizers, decent salads). i hate to compare it to an applebee's or friday's, but i guess if i had to, i would- but you don't leave with that corporate whoreing out  feeling.  the bar seating area is plentiful, it's a upbeat atmosphere with consistently decent-to-good service. it's the kind of place you could even take your dad or your coworkers, too. and when i finally say fuck it to \"if it's too loud you're too old\" and ask the server to turn down the juke box, they do."}
{"text":"A good place to grab a drink! I've only been here once, and it was quite a while ago but I had a great time in their upstairs billiards and darts area"}
{"text":"Met a group of friends here for dinner a couple weeks ago and it was decent.  I found their cider selection to be lacking (one tap, one bottled).  My fish tacos were tasty enough.  Most impressive was our server.  I wish I could name her but I don't recall.  :(  She was handling a group of about 12 of us who arrived and left at various times.  She was totally on the ball with drink orders and keeping everything straight."}
{"text":"I must share my experience, but it's definitely a good one.  I tried this spot on my lunch break one day and ordered the Jalapeno Tots to go.  Although I was given the wrong Tots (simple mistake), the management looked out and sent me a gift certificate with an apology for the mistake.  Good enough!  I decided to visit again today and ordered the Broadway Club and Jalapeno Tots and it was simply the bomb.com!  Every bite was just GREAT!!!  I don't know what else to tell you, but on the real, try this spot.  You will not be disappointed.  I will definitely be back with some friends."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try Boulders out last night because we wanted some good beer and it's within walking distance of my condo. Good choice on our behalf!   We arrived around 10:30 pm, so we took advantage of reverse happy hour ($1 off most pints on draft). They were also having half price pizza night, but we had already eaten pizza earlier in the evening, so we did not get a chance to try the pizza. Had we been hungry, it seemed like a great deal.  I was VERY impressed by their beer list! They had the biggest beer selection I've seen anywhere. When I was shopping at a specialty store last week, I noticed a \"Maui Brewing Co. Coconut Porter\" that l was very curious to try - but I passed it up because it was $10 for a 4-pack (ouch). I asked the bartender at Boulders (Rob) if they happened to have that specific beer - and to my utter surprise they did! I was happy I was able to try it out before shelling out ten bucks to buy a four pack at the store. Two thumbs up!   Speaking of Rob the bartender, he was great. Very fast to take care of all the customers around us as well as my boyfriend and I. Made sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive.   Overall, I had a really good first experience at Boulders on Broadway, and I will definitely be back. I dug the old-school ambiance with the wood paneled bar, we received very good service, and the selection of beer was amazing - truly something for everyone.   If you live in the area, I'd recommend checking it out! I plan to get some friends together and go back for one of their \"team trivia nights\" soon - sounds like a blast."}
{"text":"Boulders on Broadway is the quintessential 'corner bar.' The staff is friendly and very knowledgable about the beer they serve and where it comes from. I'm not a big burger guy but they make a tasty burger. The pizzas do the job too. If you stick to those menu items....you'll be good. My only concern is that the ceiling is going to collapse on the friendly knowledgeable staff. Without them...this place wouldn't be what it is. Fix the ceiling!"}
{"text":"Nice menu selection for both beer and food. Happy hour prices depending what time you get in. Ample seating throughout, and interesting interior decor -- which could use a major update. Decent amount of parking via private parking lot. A small patio are as you enter from the main entrance area. Not sure if our waiter was new but he was having issues that night."}
{"text":"This was our go to bar for a while. Lots of interesting brews on tap including a few \"custom\" mixed including \"Booty Sweat\" which has an amazing fruity tang to it.   For a bar the food is amazing. There nachos have pepperoni on them which now makes me feel my nachos have been lacking my entire life.   Trivia night is too loud to enjoy but a fun concept.   Always busy but lots of fun."}
{"text":"Great beer selection but as far as the food and service goes maybe we were there on a bad day. After ordering we waited forever for the food to arrive and once it did it was cold."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere here, younger mixed crowd. I'm always looking for a place like this. How's 30 beers on tap for starting. Cool vibe for a Sunday night, they had trivia going which made for a lot of fun. Good food, I would recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I was in town for business last week, and stopped in on Thursday night for a beer.  As it turns out, Thursday is half price bottle night - so I skipped the tap and hit the bottles (and cans).  The beer selection seemed massive:  I could see the taplist on the wall which was rather extensive, and the bottle menu, while not quite as big as the tap menu, was full of great beers.  If I was only in the mood to drink, this place would probably get 5 stars, but I made the mistake of ordering a burger. Maybe it's because I'm a good ol' midwestern boy who knows what red meat is supposed to taste like, or maybe I'm a f*cking burger snob - either way, this burger wasn't impressive.  The fresh bun, and toppings were nice, but the meat lacked any flavor.  My companion, who is a regular to the place told me that If I wanted a medium burger that I should order it rare - I did, and it was still well done...*long sigh*.  Two points that I feel are worth mentioning are: 1) there is an indoor bike rack, which is nice-not to protect your bike from the rain (it's the desert ,asshole), but just a little bit of additional security. and 2) There was a NORML meeting going on right in the outdoor seating section, which  everyone has to pass through to get in the door. Now, I'm not against NORML or what they stand for, but I think maybe the management could have provided adequate accommodations within the massive building, which would keep their meeting a little more private.  So, I highly recommend Boulders on Broadway for a great beer, but make sure you eat dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"In general, I really like Boulders on Broadway. The happy hour is affordable and tasty. The selection of taps is wonderful and ever-changing - in addition they have an iPhone app so you can keep up to date on what's available.  Sweet potato tots are a rare and delicious menu item. The food is a few steps above the standard bar grub. Weirdest thing - the ketchup comes out absurdly cold and sometimes chunky. Are they freezing it??  DO NOT COME HERE ON TRIVIA NIGHTS. It gets surprisingly packed and the staff becomes overwhelmed. Our waitress was incredibly rude about advising someone in our group to watch out for food runners, disappeared for half the night, my group had to pay its bill with one of the bar keeps though I waited for her so I could tip her -- when she returned she had the gull to try to keep my change and ask about the group's payment. Needless to say, SHE WORKED to receive no tip that night.  I'll give the place the benefit of the doubt on this one -- It's too difficult to resist a good reverse happy hour and Boulders sure has a good one."}
{"text":"Awesome local hangout with plenty of beer and plenty of delicious food options. The staff is friendly and very hospitable to the weary traveler."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in for dinner and trivia night. What a fun time! The atmosphere was chatty, friendly, and comfortable. My grandparents, dad, and younger siblings were all able to participate in and enjoy the trivia. We will definitely be back for that.  They've got a nice beer selection, and all are at a reasonable price. The food is bar food- nothing super spectacular, but exactly what I want to be eating with a good beer and great company. I tried their pulled pork sandwich and would recommend to any meat eaters out there!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my lunch. The menu item I really wanted offered a whole wheat tortilla with ham, Swiss, and pear. I was just talking out loud and mentioned I was allergic to pork and the waiter suggested I use chicken instead. I did and the meal was so delicious I can't wait to make it at home. Always a great beer selection. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I'm mostly a lunch customer, I still need to drink here one of these nights!! Locally owned and operated, a passion for their food and microbrews, great serving staff. I've brought so many different people to this place, from vegetarians to beer connoisseurs and everyone has been equally impressed."}
{"text":"Always a great time with the people and food at Boulder's. Trivia every other Sunday is a fabulous way to eat and spend quality time with people on your team. Happy hour Saturday when burgers are just $6 is also great, or when select appetizers are $3.99 and you can share. Great beer selection as well. I've been frequenting this place for a decade because it is that good food-and-service-wise. Can't wait to go back again! :)"}
{"text":"Reminded me of one of those bars in Boulder CO that made an executive decision not to update the place in fear that it would lose its character.   Or because it would takeaway from the weed fund.    Character here on a fri night was more like where the older hippies came to as a last resort.  No one else would take them!  Their too old said Scottsdale.  All they need is a hot tub time machine and this place would be packed!    Wings were out of this world delicious by the way.  Brews were good too but you can find so many other great brewery restaurants nearby that this would be a waste of your time.  If you want to get away from the ASU scene this is the place to do it.  If you want a good brewery keep looking.    Cheers"}
{"text":"Word to the wise, order your burger well done here. You and your toilet will be thankful.   P.S. Employees handling food should always wash their hands.  That's all I am going to say."}
{"text":"Quick place to stop by and grab a drink. Food looks good too, Love it here cabin vibe and relaxed. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wide selection of beers, many of them are on rotating taps, and delicious menu items. I usually go for Trivia Tuesday nights to compete with and against my coworkers and friends. It gets packed quickly, so make sure that you get there early to grab a seat. In addition to this, this place is really bike friendly."}
{"text":"Not long ago I noticed I was missing a bracelet from a set.  The set was very pricey and the bracelet itself is quite valuable.  In thinking back I realized I hadn't worn it for 3 or 4 weeks.  I remembered I had been to Boulders for lunch around that time.   I knew it was a long shot but I went to Boulders and asked if they had found a bracelet.  Within minutes they brought it out to me.  I was sure I would never see it again.  Not only does the place have great food and wonderful service they have honest trustworthy employees.  Now I tip very generously every single time I am in there."}
{"text":"This place is great for beers and trivia nights! They have a really great beer selection and also some delicious hamburgers. Overall, the food is a little better than what you'd expect at a place like this and it's a great place to go with friends. The last time I went, I ordered a veggie sandwich and it was delicious but I think I'd rather pay money on their burgers or pizzas next time. Definitely worth visiting!"}
{"text":"Just had a great date night with my wife, and my brother and sister-in-law. The food was amazing. I had the Kaiser calzone, and my wife had the Moose Drool Burger (jalapeno cream cheese and fried jalapenos). As always, the food was delicious, the restaurant is fun and clean, and the atmosphere was great. Our server Marrissa is the best though, she was our first server and our preferred person ever since. She knows the menu and can help select what to eat, she is always watching for and filling low drinks, and she is kind and helpful. The food and service are outstanding. The best part about Saturday is the special on burgers and sandwiches, $6 including a side (you must sign up for their free loyalty card). We are definitely regulars and always ask for Marrissa whenever possible. We just had another fun and delicious evening!"}
{"text":"everything about this place is great.  staff is top notch.  i hear they have regular celebrity sightings as well. last time i was there i saw Mike Panza.  That was pretty exciting  Also, Coheed + Nachos = Perfect"}
{"text":"Fun trivia! Food is mediocre. Crowd was cool and there is plenty to do there (video games, darts etc..) When I'm back in Tempe visiting friends I know we'll be back. Bonus for having the misters and a great seating area outside. We met some very nice locals who were up for a good chat."}
{"text":"This place is great to grab a bite to eat hang out and relax. The inside is pretty interesting brick floors and interior. The food is good as well. I have been here about 5 times now and they have never did me wrong. It's a great place for a big party or simply going to grab a bite to eat by yourself. You can even order ahead.. :-0"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  Cool little college bar with a unique affection for bicycles/outdoors.  Love the idea and execution."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer bar near ASU. If Alex or Justin 'I don't rep him' are working, you're in luck. Great beer/food recommendations there and nearby. A new must stop when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant off on for 8 years. They have a new menu and an outstanding selection of quality beer from all over the world at really good prices.   It's a pretty casual place that is reminiscent of Old Chicago. The bacon wrapped shrimp pasta and Alaskan salmon or two of my all-time personal favorites.   If you're looking for a chill spot to have a meeting, or just hang with friends you will find that the crowd is as diverse as the menu."}
{"text":"I lived down the street from here and once my boyfriend I decided to do date night here, we always returned. Food is delicious, (especially the Club sandwhich) the beer is good and the atmosphere is so much fun! We moved across the valley but will definitely make it back that way again soon. I definitely miss this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Taps. Looking for Beer above 7% they have some good double and sometimes the  triple IPA's. But for any beer enthusiast this is the low down Tap room for beer. Nothing fancy just good old college style  tap room bar with some Healthy food choices on the menu.  Real choices folks. It's what its about here. Cheers!"}
{"text":"We ordered two sodas, an order of cheese curds and one 14\" thin crust pizza.  The bill was $32.06 plus tip.  Almost $40 for pizza that had what tasted like Hunt's Tomato Sauce directly out of the can on it.  I tasted no garlic, no oregano, no spice at all.  Just plain Jane canned tomato sauce.  I honestly would have enjoyed Litte Ceasars Pizza more.  I will say the cheese curds were amazing and the staff was very friendly.  We have had sandwiches there before that were pretty good, but were terribly disappointed in the pizza.  It was also incredibly stuffy in there.  No air movement at all.  Very musty smelling and warm."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and grabbed a burger. Jalapeño tots were so good. Service was great. Really cool atmosphere overall. Will definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"I can't believe it has taken us 5 months to find this place since we moved here in November.  Given how much we miss our home back in Denver, Colorado, Boulders was like a little taste of home; laid back people, friendly staff, bikes and rock climbing gear scattered about, veggie friendly menu and more.  I have a few things that bumped this down from a 5 to a 4:  a) They have Fat Tire all over the place; fat tire coasters, fat tire decoration on their specials board, bikes here and there, etc.  But when my partner was so delighted to be able to get her favorite brew, Fat Tire, and tried to order it, they explained that they didn't *actually* have Fat Tire. She wound up getting an Odell's (another CO microbrewery), which was good....but was very disappointed.  b) The menu had some intense mis-spellings, things that if they'd ran a spell check, they would have fixed. Like vegitarian. As a marketing person, errors like that always annoy me. Nit-picky? Yes. But that's how I am.  c) Our first waiter made this whole deal about how he was going off shift to drink with his friends, and would have someone else take care of us, and bid us farewell. And then came back not, once, but twice. A little odd.  d) The bathrooms were a bit gross, and the ads expired in 2008?  However, the food was delicious. Our server Lindsay was new, so she had to check on a few things, but was friendly, timely, and made us feel very welcome.  While the people who came with us weren't impressed with their wings, the dip we got was delicious, and our other friend was super happy with their pizza.  We felt like we were at home. What a nice feeling.  Yes, I'm a bit picky about little things, but over all, we loved the atmosphere, the food, the microbrews, and the friendliness. I think we've found out local bar until we moved back to CO."}
{"text":"Cute place, not fancy but comfortable.  Huge beer selection and knowledgeable bartender.  I had the bacon wrapped shrimp and penne pasta.  Pasta was cooked perfectly and had a ton of flavor.  My boyfriend had the bacon cheese burger cooked to medium which is to done for me but I had a bite and it was still juicy and delicious.  My lunch also came with choice of soup or salad and I chose the Caesar.  Fresh parmesan plus they added sun dried tomatoes, best Caesar I've ever had. This is a great place to chill after a hike or bike ride."}
{"text":"We were staying in Tempe for the day and needed a good, quick bite to eat. This was it! I had the fire braised pulled pork sandwich and it was great! My fiance had the cheesy beef and said it was perfect. Great beer selection!"}
{"text":"All around good bar.  Lot's of bike parking and they have a  huge out door patio. It's not covered so is nice if you want to get some sun when the weather is nice. There are misters out there for when it's hot. They have a great selection of beer and I've liked every food item I've ordered. The staff is also great.    I recently started going to team trivia. It's a lot of fun. They start promptly at 630. Punctuality is not our strong suit so our group ends up trickling in during the first few questions but still a fun time. We do not win.   Couple things though I cannot forget to bring up but will not effect my rating.  1) Get that beer menu back on the chalkboard. Like seriously, it was amazingly useful. We all agree that it is a tragedy it is not there.  2) They don't have cherries.This practically made my friend cry. I do not support this.  **shout out to our awesome server last week Lauren. Great food recommendations as well!"}
{"text":"Awesome draft beer selection. Always fresh and cold too. Food is pretty darn good for the couple of times I've eaten their. The freakin big nachos are good and the Asian Bob burger is delish."}
{"text":"Walking in I had a big whif of mold.  Staff NICE, food pretty darn good.  We had appetizers.  Drinks we good.  Nice happy hour specials.  We played trivia.  Nice crowd of people.  A mix, not just college kids.  Bar was fun, not too loud and tables were only slightly sticky.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Wasn't really my cup of tea.  Dark and dirty and falling apart feeling inside.  Went for happy hour which was only *okay*.  Tried the Mexican style nachos and they were fine... certainly nothing special.  Many of the food items sounded downright disgusting- like the Italian nachos.  I can't imagine going back."}
{"text":"I can't help but love this place. I've been going here since, quite literally, the day the opened. I move further away and I keep coming back.  The staff is friendly, the food is delicious, the beer selection constantly rotates to new and interesting beers... and this is basically the de-facto hangout for climbers and cyclists! Really can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Well, 3 1/2 years ago we had our wedding reception here, so it's safe to say I like the place.  Food is always good- nice vegetarian selection is a plus.  Beer is always good.  Service is always friendly.  As long as none of that changes I'm going to keep coming here- well, as long as I live in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We came here for trivia night after hearing it was loads of fun and I have to say I don't understand what the deal is. We got sat right next to the kitchen and waited ten minutes for a server, it didn't seem that busy even though there were some tables playing trivia, it wasn't overwhelming. We ordered and it was just bar food, not awful but nothing great. It took probably 25-30 minutes to get our food though. We only ordered three appetizers, that probably don't take that long to make. The trivia was fun, but I saw people using their cellphones answers and that was kind of lame. I don't know if I'll be back here, it just wasn't as fun as I thought it would be."}
{"text":"Came here today and was a tad disappointed. The food was good I'll give them that. The waitress was not very good. Gave us the wrong beer menu and both beers we ordered were no longer available. She wasn't bet knowledgeable on the food menu either. The place needs a gut job and update as well. Oh and if you have a young one the changing table is in the hall way not the bathroom. I will give boulders on southern a try next time."}
{"text":"Nice beer selection - lots ot Tap handles including some local breweries - Think Local, Drink Local! This place doesn't mind if you come in after running, biking, playing kickball or just didn't feel like taking a shower!    Thin crust pizza, super thin almost like a lavosh.  I like it - NOT greasy!  Went simple with pepperoni, mushroom & jalapenos. Generous without being over the top - tasty sauce.    Spousal Unit got the cookie thing in a pan with icream and TWO spoons - nice try on the server's part but he wasn't SHARING!  must have been good, I blinked and the pan was empty!"}
{"text":"Beer-wise, I still prefer Papago Brewing and Topps. But the ambiance was pretty delightful, the service was great (it helps to have a cute kid), and the pizza was shockingly good.  That's not hyperbole. I mean, we're not talking Pizzeria Bianco here - deep dish is the focus - but we were stunned at the depth, complexity and deliciousness of the California Carver. It's not often you come across innovation in the world of pizza, but this was really phenomenal."}
{"text":"Such a unique and cool place with good food and great service! I'm not a beer drinker but they have a LOT on draft."}
{"text":"Been here two or three times and each time the bar was pretty lively. I think its a good place for college students. I heard they also have trivia there as well."}
{"text":"Well so far I can't see a 4 star rating  I don't trust you any more yelpers the wait person is a non personality no eye contact drone . The beer selection is much more intriguing  than the menu and the decor is cold. I ordered the basic burger because the menu was basic old 1980s bar food (sorry) but don't feel alone that pretty much most restaurants and bars in Mesa ,Tempe,ect are boring, 3 stars for the beer selection alone"}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Boulder Nachos are a must. Knowledgable staff on beer selection. BBQ wings are good too. Pizza is average."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite bar in Arizona. The food is good and the beer selection keeps me coming back as much as possible. If you haven't been here you owe it to yourself to visit."}
{"text":"I came out here with a Groupon. It was for half price. Their Sunday menu is good and fairly priced."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited the Thursday after Christmas. It was pretty slow which is what we tend to like. That aside, the ambiance of the place is great; the lodge-y decor matches the laid back atmosphere. Our server was incredibly helpful in helping us decide on a pizza (deep dish California Carver) and service was super quick! The bruschetta appetizer was my favorite part of the meal. We're very impressed and will be back."}
{"text":"Great staff, Great atmosphere, Great beer program, Great people.   The food... it will get you by if you need to eat something with your meal. There was a time when I would come here for the food. That has long past.   I would easily give this place 5 stars for the Staff and Beer. 4 for atmosphere... 2 for food though. Step up the game on the food and you'll be five stars sold again."}
{"text":"Had a salad, and there was a small little bug stuck to the lettuce, but now i know they dont wash the salad first... so i dont think ill eat here again.  The mens bathroom is atrocious! the bathroom stall was decorated with a home depot particle board falling to pieces, and ceiling tiles in the bathroom....  isnt that against building code?? Floors smelled of urine and probably mopped it in urine! Ive been to Mexican food bathrooms that were much cleaner than this. Use the towel to wash the door handles before you walk out, or get a vaccination when you leave....  But you walk in and it looks cool, nice AC, and a chill environment, good service, and attentiveness.  My stomach didnt agree with the food, and the water tasted weird, and they do not us RO water....   Good luck!"}
{"text":"Liked the ambience. Pretty typical college town pub with enough TVs to catch a game from most tables.Plenty of room and not overly crowded on a Saturday afternoon. Good beer selection, but no listing of brews on tap and too many for our waitress to remember. She recommended a seasonal brew that sounded good, and was, but 10% ABV! Print out a beer list that at least shows alcohol content, brewery, and style of beer! Ordered a pizza. Ugh mistake, $17 for a 12 inch with doughy crust and what looked and tasted like a cut up hot dog as sausage. The happy hour burger deal was excellent however and the burgers were quite good. Just having a listing of their beers would get them another star."}
{"text":"I think all reviews of this place should be time stamped!   11:45 a.m. since it was my lunch hour  I tried to get there a little early and avoid the \"lunch rush\", which, turns out there wasn't one, and now I know why. Service was ridiculously slow and the food was ridiculously mediocre.   It's too bad I wasn't there at 11:45 p.m. instead, because they do have a really impressive beer selection, which I am guessing is fueling 100% of the good reviews, because food and service really don't matter as much after a couple good beers.   an extra star awarded for color coordinating the menu so all Vegetarian items are Green. I did like that a lot."}
{"text":"They have an app for their on tap beer menu, and it is usually correct. This alone is cool. Add to that the bike friendly indoor parking and nice staff service and I like this place.  If you are looking for a laid back local school / nieghborhood type bar this should be your spot. Large selection of craft beer and a decent menu, but I was just here for drinks."}
{"text":"5 stars cause the atmosphere is great. My boyfriend and I stop in a quite a bit and have gotten to know a few servers in the short time we've been going in. It's so different from the ASU night life we all see on Mill Ave. and that's why I keep coming back. Plus, it's a minute bike ride from my house! You can lock your bike up outside or bring it inside and hang it on a bike bar. Patio is dog friendly. The food is good too. I've tried quite a few things on the menu... Pizza is delicious.. pulled pork was decent.. calzones are great... Burgers are great... The guacamole is delicious too!! Beer prices can be a little high but it's a good trade off for the experience I have everytime I go in. And their music is always catching my ear! Def. planning on being a regular."}
{"text":"Love this place and the owner offered me up a free lunch since I made a stink about the lousy food last time. Food was much improved and I give the owner 2 thumbs up for making things right. Keep up the good work. Never be lazy on the food. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, I had the California Carver man what great flavor!  The service was great too very attentive!  After ordering, I found out it was half-price pizza on Monday great plus!"}
{"text":"Lunch is not as busy as dinner and happy hour but I kinda like a mellow lunch time. Food and staff are just as amazing as always. And to top it off they just started a lunch punch card program, buy 5 and get the 6th lunch free."}
{"text":"Non-greasy pizza, fan-frigging-tastic beer selection, and laid back atmosphere. It's our go-to place when we don' t know where we want to go."}
{"text":"I would give B.O.B. a 3-star rating, but that extra star comes as a direct result of the amazing selection of draft beers this place has. Their lineup features lots of domestic specialty brews and a surprising amount of other stuff available. Plus, since they rotate the selection so much, the bartenders are happily willing to give samples of what's new, which is the way it should be. I got no puzzled faces, groans or stinginess.   The service we had was attentive and the food was good. My friend ordered the \"interactive\" guacamole and the waitress came out and made it right then and there at the table. Overall, I was impressed! Beer lovers beware, untold deliciousness awaits you inside, beneath the ski decor and deers' heads."}
{"text":"\"White chocolate-flavored beer?\"  Those were the last words I said before falling in love.  The thing is, I don't even like white chocolate.  But, as a beer, my tastebuds and my stomach were transported to the closest thing on Earth that could be referred to as Heaven.  I'm exaggerating, but not very much.  It's like saying, \"A gajillion!\" when the actual number is 753 quadrillion.  Their other beers are great, too.  You can always ask, \"Hey, what's new here?\" and they'll go through an exhaustive list.  Ask them what their new favorite is and you'll get something amazing.  The food is not only nothing special, I don't even recommend going there with food in mind.  It's not terrible but it's really just not that good.  They have a chicken pesto sandwich that's alright, but generally, I would say, come here after you already ate and stick to beer.  The service is great.  They're always, always as nice as can be without being Ned Flanders about it.  If I ever saw someone being a dick to one of the help, I'd probably lose my shit and go Tony Soprano on 'em.  I saw Barack Obama's acceptance speech here, the vice presidential debate between Biden and Palin and the first half of the Super Bowl.  This is sort of like my second home, only maybe a little bit better because there's more than one toilet."}
{"text":"This is a must. Great beer selection, tasty piazza, great happy hour menu and more. The owner and his staff made me feel at home every time! This one is from the heart AND the best juke box since Al's Bar in old school LA! Blues, blues and more Blues! Perfect!"}
{"text":"The food is great, but the service is lousy. Don't go here unless you have a few hours to kill waiting to be seated...or for your order to be taken...or for your check. We are locals, not college students, and this place is within walking distance from our house. We would really love to make this our regular haunt, but after several frustrating attempts to eat & drink here, we've had to find somewhere else to hang out for game night.  Boulders is actually a really nice restaurant and bar with a friendly atmosphere and a fantastic craft beer selection, and the food is inexpensive and fresh and delicious, but we have had service problems soooo many times. We have been there to eat and drink and have waited for a half an hour to be greeted, and several times we have been there and our meal from beginning to end has taken 2-3 hours to complete. Twice we have been denied a table altogether because of Trivia night, and we were turned away.  The wait staff seem to not use the \"section system\", and I surmise that the \"team effort\" system is that everyone is supposed to watch everyone's tables. This may work in some places, but it definitely doesn't work here. Sometimes you seat yourself, sometimes you don't. Sometimes it's marked \"Seat Yourself\", but sometimes it's not. So, you may find yourself standing there for a while wondering what to do while the servers walk past, especially when it's busy. You have to kinda wander around and hope you find a table somewhere. It's a bit awkward, even if you've been there a few times. On one visit, we stood at the host stand for 30 minutes waiting for someone to acknowledge us. No one did. I left a note that we had waited, but we were hungry so we were going up the street to a competing establishment. I had hoped that might alert the management that there had been a problem. It didn't...  On another visit, a hostess greeted us, and we were told that it was trivia night and that we couldn't be given a table because people could pretty much stay there all night if they wanted. Instead of having a non-trivia section for regular diners, we were turned away. This happened once in the fall and again in the spring.  On our next visit, the same 30 minute seating wait occurred at the host stand. The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an \"Are you being helped?\" until finally one of the bartenders was walking past and asked if we were picking up an take-out order. It was then that we found out we were supposed to just go sit down. It was very busy, and we got lucky that we found one table open. However, once we did, we sat at the table for another 30 minutes while no one greeted us or even took a drink order. There were tables with guests all around us, and servers were actively waiting them, but no one ever came to our table. On our way out, someone asked how everything was. We said we didn't know because we'd been there for an hour and had never even been given a menu.   If you DO manage to get a table and get an order placed, make sure that you ask for everything you might need right up front when they bring your food, including anymore drinks. Table check-backs are few and far between, and if you ask for something, chances are your meal will be over before you even get it. We often have to flag someone down to bring us our check, and this is sometimes a half hour to 45 minutes after we've finished eating. This is apparently normal and occurs more often then not. We had some friends meet us there for dinner once. It was somewhat embarrassing to have to ask for a box for his wife just as her meal came because the service had been so slow that she missed her dinner opportunity before she had to leave for work.  The wait staff are very friendly, the owners are great people, and the food and atmosphere is very nice, but it's kind of a pain to eat there, especially if you're hungry or have other things you want to do that night. We really wish we could eat there all the time, which is why we keep going back and trying again and again. We would be in there all the time, at least once a week, but the service continues to be too unpredictable to be able to enjoy the evening. The place does, however, have take-out, which is something that we do when we're in the mood for the food and you want to go get it and bring it back before the game starts. If you get take-out, you may not get beer and hang out, but at least you'll get food and service, plus, it's good for your wallet, since you're not spending nearly as much as you would if you dined in."}
{"text":"Trivia on Saturday night with my daughter and her friends.  What a great time! Good beers fun and Trivia.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"What a way to cap off the night! After a couple of cousins and I caught a game at Salt River. We had to pick up wifie and the girls at our daughters house. So all nine of us went searching for a place for dinner. Our first choice, who I am not going to disclosed. Is closed on Sundays, and it wasn't Chick fil A! So we ended up coming here. Now when we first walked in, we where told to sit any where we wanted. I had some doubts at first, the music they had on was some kind of meditation type. And the first item I seen on the menu was the Tree huggin Veg head! I was like, NO! Lets go! But my professional beer drink-en cousin seen the list of beers, so we decided to stay! And I was glad that we did! Food: I had their Ro Diddy Steak Sandwich, it is basically a steak sandwich with red peppers and cheese. I really enjoyed it. Meals comes with a choice of sides, I had their fries. Their fries are actually cross cut fries, just like the ones at Arby's. Meal was very good.  The rest of the crew had many different items, seems like everyone enjoyed dinner. Service:  As soon we walked in, they were on top of us right away. We sat, they took our drink order, and we got our food very quickly. Our waitress did seem to forget about us at the end. But no big deal, place really got busy during the evening. But throughout our meal, she took very good care of us.  Yes I judged this place by their cover, and glad I was proven wrong. Since we live in the west valley, our visits will be limited. But I will make it a point, when we visit the area to come here."}
{"text":"I really WANT to like Boulders, but they make it very hard.  I don't have any problems with their food. I mean, it's bar food! It serves it's purpose and usually what I've ordered is tasty. They have amazing fried pickles!  The beer list is also good. They rotate the taps a lot so there is usually something new for me to try.  \"So, Andi. What's the problem?\"  The service here SUCKS. Like really, really bad. I've been here on busy nights (Trivia, Tap Takeover, other events) and I've been here in the middle of the day when it was a ghost town. Same result: bad service.  I've had beers sit empty while I try to spot where my waitress is. I've waited to get my check for 45 minutes. I've even had to go ask a different waitress what's up to find out mine dipped without saying anything.  Overall, I think Boulders has the potential to be a cool spot. It just needs a MAJOR service-adjustment."}
{"text":"If I was voting on beer selection this place would be a 5. They have a large selection of reasonably priced drafts and they change weekly brining in new and different beers to try.   I can also say most of the servers are very good. I come every week for trivia on tuesdays and the service is always good, nobody has any problem with splitting tabs for the 6 or so people we have every week. I never go long with out a drink or waiting to order. It is a very well run crew.  Now for the bad the food is very hit or miss and even the hits aren't that exciting. Since I am here on tuesdays I often get appetizers as they are half off. Some like the southwestern or apple/pear quesadillas are good and a solid amount of food. Others like the pizza wheels are barely edible. I have had some of the regular menu items and they often suffer from being bland or over salted. Some recommendations of mine on stuff to get include the california carver burger or pizza, the hummus appetizer, and the tatonka burger.   Also costing them points is bad AC and that the bathroom may be one of the worst I have seen in an otherwise decent place. They have a horrible hand dryer that isn't high flow or hot and they don't have paper towels as an option. The door to the toilet doesn't have any lock and swings open on it's own.  If you want a place to have fun drinking and playing trivia you can do worse than here. Just be careful with the food selections and don't get your hopes up."}
{"text":"Beer is great. Trivia is fun. Servers are awesome. Food quality varies. Deserves 5-stars if the food was better."}
{"text":"Banging food. I had the Chuck Norris pizza...yummmm....not sure how many critters died for it...but well worth it!! Hubby got the Moose Drool burger and said it was great! Tons of beer choices, cool funky atmosphere . Good hang out spot for buddies to grub and chill."}
{"text":"I thought I would share my experience with this place. The food is good, the fish is very tender, and the shrimp wrapped in bacon is amazing!  The reason I'm giving this two stars is that when you place an online order on LivingSocial, expect to wait an additional 30 minutes before your order is ready, as they don't start preparing it until you arrive.  I had an order scheduled for pickup at 5:30PM on a weekday, and waited literally 30 minutes for it. I even placed the order a few hours earlier to give them extra time in case they were busy. They claimed that they receive orders via fax, and nobody is in the office. Moral of the story, if you place an online order, you need to call them before you arrive, otherwise, expect to wait a while for it."}
{"text":"Great beers...Boulder Nachos YUM!  Great place for The Beer for Brains Fundraiser, Thanks !!"}
{"text":"Just had my first taste of breakfast here at Boulders and I was not disappointed. They have about 7 awesome breakfast combinations and I can't wait to try them all. Had the eggs benedict today and it was great. The sweet potatoes that come with it are the bomb. You'd be crazy to not to give it a shot."}
{"text":"We hosted a small get together for the holidays with about 20 people. I thought the food was pretty good and the beer selection is greeat. The service was okay. When visiting the restroom, I found both ladies stalls to have ZERO TP and they had ZERO hand towels. This was on a Friday at 5:30pm... I then mentioned this our server and she did not apologize. As I started to look more closely at Boulders, it looks like they may be soft on \"housekeeping\" duties. So for me, I will not be returning here... but if you want to hang out with the guys, knock down a couple of beers and watch a game, this place will work... just not clean enough for me."}
{"text":"I had heard about this bar from friends and decided to try it. Great list if beers on tap, some micro brews you probably won't find many other places. They had trivia going on which packed the place in a Sunday night.  I ordered the Salmon BLT which tho sounds like an odd combo, it was excellent!! Would definitely go back for that again. Overall good place, priced right. Friendly bartenders and good food."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. Their beer selection was huge but the food was disappointing. We tried several appetizers and there wasn't anything I would go back for. It was all very simple, small portions, and basic."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. I live down the street and for all of the choices of to go food Boulders is always clutch with quality good food at a good price. Great beer selection, chill bar, awesome staff, and laid back atmosphere. Indoor bike rack makes it convienent to cycle on over and grab a pint and a bite. They have everything from great pizzas to delicious fish tacos.... you can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon and had a delicious Bloody Mary. This is the best Bloody Mary I've ever had. Perfect amount of heat, loaded up with bacon. I got the Broadway Club with fries which was equally delicious. Service was great. Atmosphere is relaxing."}
{"text":"We headed here on Saturday night.  I like the concept and the food sounded tasty.  I was also excited based on the reviews.  Unfortunately, the food for our large group trickled out  slowly, and it was only mediocre.  The server was kind, but overall not a good experience."}
{"text":"No harm, no foul but Boulders is not for me. It's a place for a quick drink and a taste of their waffle fries. But not one where you can linger. It's a large space broken up into a few sections. It's dark and if your nose is sensitive, it'll pick up that \"je ne sais what\" smell. It greeted me at the entrance and I got a little concerned. But not enough to be deterred but I knew I wasn't staying long enough to hang my hat."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Great bar style food! My husband loves their beer selection and I love that they have Strongbow on tap and Crispin in bottles! At other restaurants I have to settle for a beer that I'm not crazy about....my Strongbow and Crispin I AM CRAZY ABOUT! Thank you for carrying my ciders! Food is good, bar food....lets get this straight....this isn't a luxury restaurant folks.....If you go frequently, get diner reward card. Honestly...awesome. I love supporting local businesses and I'm so glad they support their local breweries. I get intense cravings for this place frequently. Will certainly be back, again and again!"}
{"text":"One of the best and most attentive bartenders around.  Justin is the effin man.  Great selection and service.  Food is better than average."}
{"text":"All burgers and sandwiches were $7 when I went in but went with the Big Freaking Nachos yummy. Our bartender/server Lauren was awesome"}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection, enough food choices (and more than you'd expect at a bar), and a much smaller bill than I was expecting. Thank you all for the recommendations, I'm adding my own."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite bar in Tempe. They always have a great beer selection and the food is delicious. Both of their vegetarian pizzas, the king of hearts and the pizza of sustainability, are amazing."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, delicious pizza and appetizers, and really great discounts when you join their rewards club (Summit Society?) like 1/2 off pizza on Mondays, 1/2 off appetizers on Tuesdays, et cetera. Also all-day happy hour on weekends and 3pm-7pm during the week. Trivia nights are very fun. Atmosphere is casual and comfortable, and the staff are super friendly. Lots of indoor seating and a few picnic tables outside. Park your bike on the rack inside so it doesn't get stolen."}
{"text":"I'm not one to usually frequent bars (at least, not since my college days, which let's just say, was a long time ago), but my college age son invited me to join him and his friends on Tuesday trivia night.  I love Boulders and  have been going there almost every week since the 1st time a year ago..  The staff is friendly and always welcoming and very accommodating.  Most of the waiters remember what I drink each time and have it on the table before I even sit down (no lie!).   I have tried many of the menu items but my favorite is the pine nut bleu cheese salad.  The appetizers are half price on Tuesdays and the portion sizes are huge so you get a really good value for the price. My son usually gets the pizza nuggets and his friends usually get the nachos which are yummy. I have to agree with the other reviewers, pertaining to their comments on the air conditioning or lack there of.  I am usually so involved in discussion or trivia brainstorming that I can forget about the heat (after all we do live in Arizona and I am somewhat used to it by now), but more ceiling fans might be nice.  I recommend Boulders to anyone who is looking for a fun, casual, entertaining time.  Tuesday nights have been packed lately so you would want to get there early if you have a big group.  On second thought, maybe you would want to go on a night other than Tuesday, so my group will be sure to have a place to sit together.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Q: The best selection of beers on tap? A: Boulder's.              I resisted this place for as long as I could, pedaling past it furiously, thinking \"God, that place looks like it SUCKS\", always opting for PV. But then... like one day I finally noticed the giant stencil of a bicycle painted near the door. I could hear the chords from \"The Neverending Story\" everytime they showed the serpent symbol. I was curious. Then one night I noticed some skinny guys in flannel shirts, black frames laughing and casually pulling their bicycles INSIDE of Boulders.          My roommates were meeting up some friends at Boulder's and I just had to join them. I walked in to see a gigantic space, really pretty overwhelming. They recently added a beam to the bicycle space so you can hang your bike up (I have a heavy old vintage frame so I park poor Charley against the wall), and you get overwhelmed by the space: 1) There are roomes located down the stairs to your left. Unless it is very busy and a lot of servers, you will be not noticed down there-tons of booths and lights, like an old western Pizza Hut 2) Up the stairs is kind of a low roof-ceilinged room with long tables perfect for big groups of friends eating pizza, drinking beer (once again, clear it with the wait staff) and on the other side a pool table you can overlook the bar crowd like a lil patio 3) the main room down the stairs where the bar is with rows of high tables that spill out down another pair of stairs to another pool table and more booths.  We usually just pick a table right behind the bar if possible so you get fast service-but we love the wait staff here and they are always willing to give a sample, talk about the beer, discuss the specials in details, etc.  Now, regarding the decor-it is weird. It is like a ski lodge/pizza hut/old cabin sports bar, etc. It is just a fish out of water here in Tempe. But don't hold the decor against it (think about how many people ever go inside of Casey Moore's and how dank and ground round-ish and kinda gross it is inside), since for all you supposed beer snobs, it really is more about the beer.  The beer. OMG. I was stunned when I first came here-you mean you specialize in DogFishHead seasonal drafts? Great White? Shark Attack? Fat Tire and Sam Adams seasonals? I mean, I can't even begin to tell you about the beers b/c there are too many to talk about! And that isn't including bottles and cans they have and rotate frequently. Come here once a week and you are guaranteed a new beer on tap to try. In fact, coming here made me less of a fan of Casey's! I realized how much that bar is coasting by on reputation and smokers on the patio b/c their mixed drinks are weak, their food is pricey for what it is, and they never have any good specials on their boring beer on tap! Here, they have happy hour and reverse happy hour specials, and a different meal deal every night of the week!  Plus, I can never have that much bar food anyway, but I do like their Bar Stuff platter w/fried zucchini, onion rings, mozz stix, etc. And their pizza really is good! Like they have this one with avocado, bacon and french onion rings, omg it is the bomb-and their plan pizza is good too. The guys like the sandwiches, but I never really come here for dinner, more like a late weekday night beer and snack, relax with friends, and pedal back home.  On weekends it is becoming packed, but stop by here a late Tuesday and check it out.  Oh, and yes, sometimes people play terrible music on the jukebox-but that is b/c this is a real person bar, not a hipster bar (yet), and they like some shitty music, okay? And it is an internet jukebox, not a cool one like at Shady's-but sometimes someone plays Snoop's \"Sensual Seduction\" and it just feels right, okay?  \"Gonna take my time, tyyyyyiiimmee\""}
{"text":"Great beer selection and excellent customer service. Very cool atmosphere. Great deals and affordable good food. Wish we would've found this place earlier on our trip. We will definitely be coming back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Had to run to store to get tonic water...meh."}
{"text":"We come here nearly every Tuesday for Team Trivia. They have a very smart crowd so you have to bring your A-game.  It's a very big and winding place, with multiple level changes and side rooms. Our last trip, they were almost finished with the new bathrooms! (which previously looked like something out of Trainspotting). The place has a great beer selection of local craft and domestic/imports. They have an extensive food menu and we've had the only two veggie options over and over....the black bean burger and the tree huggin veg head. The black bean burger is ok. Tastes like a frozen patty burger. The handcut chips make up for the burger. The tree huggin veg head is full of artichokes and makes for tasty alternative. I've had the spinach artichoke calzone and it was huge and delicious, and I felt way too guilty for eating the whole thing. The vegetarian Kaiser pizza is a decent pizza...it tasted a little \"manufactured\" but I still ate the whole thing.  Service in the top deck has been ok, but we always have to flag the waitress down for refills and food. Service in the lower deck is always much better. Indoor bike parking btw."}
{"text":"We ended up going here on a whim, we live less than a mile from it and drive by it daily. The menu was huge, the service was great, and the food was WONFERFUL! They put a twist on the usual everyday bar food and make things new and delicious. When we first walked in I was worried if the place was kid friendly, but it totally was, the kids choices were perfectly priced and portioned. We also came here with some beer savvy friends who were blown away by the beer selection. so all in all, we love this place!!"}
{"text":"A couple buddies and I came here for a early lunch, and to have a few beers, we got the Big Nachos with the peppers and olives on the side cause I'm picky like that, and wow it's served on a 16inch pizza pan with some red sause. The sausage was a little light but the nachos were really good, we also got a pesto quesadea that looked really good and then I got a beef sandwitch and fries that I could not finsh that's a lot of beef mmmm. I walked around a little bit and this place is huge they have a upstairs witha pool table and a dart board, I would love to come back here and see what it's like at night. The people there were very friendly and seemed like a fun place to have a beer, food or just to hang with friends."}
{"text":"Fun night watching the Astro's win the World Series.   Experience was better than expected and we'll worth stopping in. Good mix of students and locals with a very friendly staff If you like beer and a great burger this will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Pub quiz!  This place has a fun, casual atmosphere and the food is quite good.  They have a large assortment of drinks, but tonight, I just came for trivial with some good friends. :]"}
{"text":"Nice cozy place to hang out with friends or family! Great music  & probably all your favorite booze at the bar. Food is especially fantastic & people are friendly! Also you can watch your favorite football team on game days! Highly recommend this place!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are great but don't expect to find anything worth eating for less than $10-12. You can get comparable food for much less elsewhere.   That said, their draft lineup is impressive and reasonably priced. They also offer hard cider on tap which is a cool plus if you don't like beer or cannot eat gluten.   Essentially, come to this place for drinks but eat before you arrive."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch, got the calzone and an IPA - thought I had been whisked to a ski lodge.  I suppose I was most impressed cause there aren't many joints in town with décor / ambiance like that.  The calzone was really good, the beer was nice and cold and the service was friendly and prompt.  I wasn't necessarily blown away by anything, but it exceeded expectations for a lunch stop on a whim.  I think I'll have to come back for a happy hour, I'm certain it's more fun when it's packed!"}
{"text":"Ordered items to go (delivery) and was not happy with what I received or the customer service. The first item - Pine Nut Blue Cheese Salad - mix of organic spinach and green leaf lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, pine nuts, blue cheese crumbles and freshly tossed with pear vinaigrette. This salad included very few vegetables other than the lettuce, the blue cheese was sparse and the vinaigrette was bottled and bland. My main course - Build Your Own 'Zone - Choose three toppings plus melted mozzarella and ricotta cheeses. I ordered a vegetarian (mushroom, artichoke, spinach) Calzone but when I went to take my first bite I got CHICKEN. I called Boulders on Broadway and they apologized and said they would send a new item. I got a call back about 15 minutes later letting me know it would be 2 hours before they could deliver my new order. It was already late so I just asked for a refund to my credit card. I was told this would take at least a month. After asking to talk to a manager I finally got a refund to my credit card the next day. Lots of $$ for an average salad that cost a delivery charge, delivery tip and fees."}
{"text":"Love the staff and the expert beer advice and their fantastic hospitality!"}
{"text":"Awesome neighborhood spot where you can grab a beer, lunch, or connect with the community in some sort of way. Endless beer selection with service that knows they're beer and can make recommendations for you easily. Love the atmosphere and quality - not only beer but food is matches. Recommend to anyone that loves their beer and looking to be taken care of."}
{"text":"Good service while I was here. Came with a small group. We sat in a nice quiet area where we could talk and such. Our waitress took good care of us and our drinks getting them out to us in a quick manner. Good beer, good service. Haven't tried the food, but the atmosphere is nice. The patio is nice to smoke at"}
{"text":"My friend and I used to play trivia here on Tuesdays until we had one too many meals with poor concepts  (over-greasy, over-elaborate, over-cooked) and way too many flat beers on draught.  For a place known for having revolving craft beer, I'd expect not to repeatedly get flat drinks, we mentioned the problem to the manager a few different occasions and kept getting told it must just be the end of the keg; if I end up here I only get bottled beverages now.   We kept trying the menu items and after eating most of them among us on our visits I can only recommend the wings and the fried zucchini.  Sometimes the servers were great, sometimes the servers weren't great...really depends on who you get."}
{"text":"I ordered fish tacos for delivery- the fish tasted bad, like spoiled. Fish should not taste like this. My coworker ordered a calazone- was mediocre at best. Won't try here again!"}
{"text":"On the night of a show at The Clubhouse, I went to a record store to pick up the tickets. I had researched restaurants close to the venue on Yelp before I left and decided on Boulders. I asked one of the record  store clerks whether he had been there, and he said he had. I asked if he liked it, and he said he didn't. When I asked why, he said \"It's just not really my scene.\" He then followed up with, \"Are you into like, craft beers, and like indie rock, mountain biking, that kind of thing?\" Umm, yeah, pretty much. \"Then you'll like it.\"  This is my new place. Although I feel a bit typecast, I guess they nailed it for a dude like me. Cider for the gf, Bell's Two Hearted Ale draft for me (that alone is worth about 3 or 4 stars in my world), and we split a \"build your own\" pizza. It was thin crust, which reminded me of Rosati's, although it could have used some more sauce (maybe I'll ask for extra next time).   The beer selection is awesome - just about every awesome IPA (I prefer hoppy stuff) that I could think of. If I remember right, there were like 20 or 30 on draft. Such a relief when the fanciest beer I can get at a lot of restaurants I go to is Sam Adams, Fat Tire, or Guinness. We were talked into a skillet cookie to top it off - not something I'd do every time, but well worth it.  I love this place, and I will surely be coming back."}
{"text":"Our MeetUp group often goes out after our Monday night meetings. We've chosen B on B repeatedly because of the awesome service. Isaac remembers all of our names even though sometimes there are 10 or more of us. It's a really fun place with a long, ever-rotating beer list and tasty, reasonably priced eats too! Ask for Isaac."}
{"text":"I come here often. It's around where my office is.   Anyways, they've got a fairly decent beer selection. Their staff is fairly friendly. Prices are higher than what I'd like but happy hour is when I recommend going because prices are reasonable at that point. Food is good, beers are good. I recommend the kiltlifter, strongbow, or hefenweizen."}
{"text":"I am biased because my friend from high school owns this place. However even if he didn't, I will still say this place rocks. The food is great, the beer is fabulous and the people there are awesome. I need to get back soon to try some of their meads as well as some of their newer selections. Seriously though, it really is a great place, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday night trivia - so, so fun! The emcee reads a question and gives you a few minutes to write down and turn in an answer - plenty of time to chat with your party and continue conversation while participating in the trivia activity simultaneously. A mix of challenging and easier questions - overall, really well-run!   Nice selection of beers, and they were cheap - $4.50 for 14oz. beers and $4 for well drinks - not bad! The only food we tried were the pepperoni pizza rolls - they were okay, but didn't have a ton of flavor, and it didn't seem like the five 1\" rolls were really worth $10.   The service is why I'm giving it three stars - we had to waive down our server every time we needed something (even when 5+ members of our party had empty water glasses!). It's nice to be left alone to enjoy the trivia, but we were also there to enjoy drinks and food, which was hard to do when our server was nowhere to be found. The trivia was enough fun that I'll definitely be back, though!"}
{"text":"When I left Arizona six years ago, the craft beer scene consisted of Papago Brewery and Four Peaks. I would never complain about either, but there just wasn't much going on. After a recent visit, however, I found that there are not only a ton of new breweries but pretty awesome beer bars as well. Bravo, Arizona.    My visit just happened to coincide with AZ Beer Week (seriously) and Boulders on Broadway had an impressive lineup of drafts for the occasion.The day prior, they had tapped Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA, something that beer bars in San Diego only dream about. They also had a bunch of seasonals and local beers that I would never be able to get back home.  After a few beers, I wanted pizza, my significant other did not... but this caused no problem at all due to their \"personal\" sized pizzas.  Genius!  Why don't more bars do this? Life is great when you're not arguing with friends about topping choices.   I only wish this place was around when I was in college. No offense to Devil House (RIP), but chugging penny beers until someone broke the seal (literally, tape covering the bathroom door) just doesn't seem to measure up."}
{"text":"This place is just the cutest. They have a great selection of rotating beers (just as large as Angel's Trumpet, actually!), and the food and service are great. The menu has great variety, whether you're a carnivore, a vegetarian, or looking for lighter fare. And yes, they do have french fries.  The greatest thing about this place, though, is how they make it a playground for the community. It's a climbers' bar, so the decor speaks to that, but they also have ample bike parking and regular community events. Also, trivia. So much trivia. On Wednesdays and Saturdays!   Long story short, it's basically the Cheers of Tempe. I wouldn't bring out-of-towners in to admire its glory, but I'd freak out of someone from the area told me they'd never been there. As a downtown-Phoenix loyalist, I still make my way to TempeTown about once a month to enjoy this space with good company. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I stopped into this bar during a business trip to Phoenix for a quick bite and I'm so happy I did! I enjoyed a veggie burger and fries, it was perfect. Veggie burgers aren't always great but this place got it right. They also had outdoor seating, a jukebox and a friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Beer.....need I say more? Great variety of local and craft beer. The staff is great and fun to be around."}
{"text":"Beer. Bicycles. Food. The three essentials to Boulders on Broadway:  Ride a bike and have no worry about it being stolen as you can bring it inside to their spacious bike racks. Most of the employees ride bikes as well, so feel free to strike up conversation about cycling. On that note, all of the employees are friendly and (usually) prompt on drinks/ordering/etc, when it's busy sometimes there is a delay but that's standard for most businesses. Especially neighborhood places.  Lots of tap beers (12+) and even more bottles/cans in the cooler. Fans of Stone Brewing, Dogfish Head and other distributed craft brewing brands will be pleased to see their selection. The taps and stock changed semi-frequently but not enough that you won't have something to like week to week.  There are a few bland selections on the menu and other things that are very good. I can attest to anything \"Southwest\" on the menu being delicious, I usually go for the Southwest Quesadilla (which you can get veggie). Their pizzas are above average, we're not talking LGO, Cibo or Bianco quality, but they are worth a shot if that's your craving. My friend likes the Pepperoni Wheels, I find them a bit oily while still being good. One item I found lacking was the \"Turkey Sandwich\" and the regular nacho plate didn't impress either. They were both below average but not the worst I've ever had.  They have good specials throughout the week, with my favorites being Monday (1/2 price pizza), Tuesday (1/2 price apps) and Thursday (1/2 price select bottles, one each, as to get people to drink different beers)."}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**  Came in for Trivia Tuesday. They have plenty of options on the menu for vegetarians. I made it for Happy Hour and they have multiple food options, but the portions are less than half the size. Most places still serve full size items during happy hour. My entire party had indigestion after we left, we tried to figure out what it was, but we couldn't.   The service was slow, it took us 30 minutes to get our drink orders. We could hardly get a hold of our waiter to order food, it was frustrating. The waiter kept mixing up our checks that eventually we had to write out our bills.   Overall, trivia night was a blast, the food and service not so much."}
{"text":"My hubby and I really love trying new beers here.  The list is always quite extensive and the employees are always really knowledgeable about the draft offerings.  The food is the type of bar food that you would expect.  It's pretty good, but I always feel a tiny bit less satisfied than I should compared to the cost of the meal."}
{"text":"Don't get the pizza!   I don't know who they sampled their food with before going live, but this is the most bland pizza I've ever had.  How can you have pepperoni with no flavor?"}
{"text":"Quick friendly service, and the food was great. Love the variety of beers to choose from as well.."}
{"text":"My major gripes:  no printed drink menu, so you have to download an app to see the beer selection. Just go to their website though, since it seemed to offer the same options.  But what happens when you don't have a smartphone? You can ask your server for their phone, but obviously you would feel bad for taking a long time to decide since they're literally \"waiting\" on you.  They do have their drink list on a TV downstairs, but the print is so small that you have to get into another table's grill just to read it.   After circumscribing through the drink menu issue, you then realize that there are no PRICES on the menu. So I hope you know which beers are expensive...since I did get a little bit of a sticker shock when the bill came.  It was a busy night, and they honored 'seating yourself' at the bar. I usually don't mind this option, but I'm not sure if they had assigned servers either. We had multiple servers that came to take our orders and it was a lot more confusing than need be.   All that said, love their Saturday all-day happy hour & trivia night and we'll probably be back."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with friends for trivia. I ordered an ice tea and a personal Vegetable Kaiser Pizza. The pizza was soggy, bland and greasy. The ice tea was horrible even with sweetener. I will continue attending for trivia, but will seek food elsewhere."}
{"text":"What a great place! Always has a good beer selection and new beers to try very often and a really cool atmosphere. The sweet potato tots are delicious and the pizza is my favorite! Try the thin crust! You won't be disappointed. They do half price pizza on Mondays too! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying my first experience at this place was the best we went in last night and had a horrible time I asked the waiter if I can pay with barter bucks and he said no problem but after he scene what I was paying with his attitude changed it shouldn't matter what form of payment we use also if he was smart on barer bucks u get a mandatory tip of 15 percent so no Matter what your getting a good tip we were there from 730 to 1030 playing trivia etc the food was the best like always but the street tacos barley had any meet and the cookie ice cream at the end wasn't that good but the worst part was our 45 year old bald head waiter was rude the whole time barley came to our table kept pushing me to pay the bill like I was gonna dine and dash so at the end I payed with barter bucks and didn't leave the tip anyone that's as rude as him should be fired my wife forgot her phone there so we called it and the manager picked up and said we shorted our waiter I then went to explain how horrible the waiter was etc and Ben the manager told us to come down and get our phone and he would give us a gift card so this place is definitely a 5 but there employee deserves a zero thanks Ben for taking care of us"}
{"text":"Great wings, burgers, and artichoke dip!  We went on trivia night but didn't play because we had plans after dinner but there was a nice atmosphere as the place started to fill up with people from all ages.  The inside reminded me of Northern Michigan and made me feel like I was home."}
{"text":"Justin (bartender) just told me to 'yelp the f*(k outta me'.... so 5 stars because restaurant wise....  service, knowledge, food, beer selection, etc are worth the trip.  The bartenders are fantastic too."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. Fun atmosphere. Tell them you are a first time visitor and a manager will come chat with you and give you a reason to come back. Great savings with a Groupon as well. Thank you and we'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"I don't recommend ordering food.  However, the service is always spectacular. Justin and Chris have great recommendations. The bar always has a great beer list to choose from. They also get great sours on tap such as the two brothers number two."}
{"text":"I love Boulders! I frequently visit since I am within walking distance and enjoy bringing my dog along to the patio area. I love the outdoor staff and have had a good time inside as well, but feel more \"at home\" on the patio due to the sheer number of hours I've spent there! We regularly have Ashley help us, who is an amazing server.  I always feel very welcome at Boulders and it is one of my favorite restaurants. I have celiac disease and have never become ill after eating their gluten free pizza, which is very rare for me when I order gluten free crust. Typically I just assume cross contamination can occur, but Boulders seems to do a stellar job at preventing it.   Since I can't have beer, I often feel a bit out of place ordering a cocktail. I wish they had more ciders on draft, but I'm happy with the ace joker!   The food is amazing. I've brought both my parents to Boulders and they may be skeptical initially, but both leave very happy!  I love this place and am so happy they are so close to me."}
{"text":"Just got take out here so not sure the experience as a restaurant is as a whole but the food is awesome! I got the meatball Stromboli and although the sauce was kind of weak the whole Stromboli  was delicious. And the garlic fries were awesome"}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection for the Tempe area.  Many local and obscure beers on tap and even more in the coolers.    The food has been hit or miss in the three times I've been here so far.  Nothing has really struck me as amazing, but nothing was so horrible that I had to stop eating it or send it back.  The servers can also be a bit absent with such a large place, so you're much better off to sit at the bar, the bartenders are great.  Come mainly for the beer in a place with attentive bartenders and relaxed atmosphere that doesn't get too loud for a bar."}
{"text":"Great hang out for watching games, playing games, catching up with ole friends, making new ones at tap take overs, or just having a time. Great pizza, apps, and bar food. Great Attic, and knowledgeable staff  They make it great, biking, walking or driving. Come on in and let the world pass by, as you take time for the important things: friends."}
{"text":"Boulders is my JAM!!!   Seriously though, this is our favorite neighborhood bar that happens to have amazing food. The decision to move into our current home was made purely on how close it was to long board to Boulders (longer story behind this), and we have been coming here for years now.   One of the best parts about this place is their employees. There are several amazing individuals that work here and provide a wonderful customer service experience. Being a regular has its perks.   You can never go wrong with a burger, hungover mans best friend, or one of the phenomenal quesadillas. I love that their menu is diverse and most everything is thoroughly enjoyable. They have great specials every day of the week and trivia night is always a blast.   Do yourself a favor and stop in here for an evening beer and burger or even better, a weekend breakfast and a famous Doubleday Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"We have been coming into boulders almost every Saturday for the past two months ! Everytime we have come in we have had the same bartender (Justin) && manager (Ben) ... Awesome service , always!!   Also a great place to come late nights for pizza && wings !!"}
{"text":"Wanted to find a place close to my hotel that had a good selection of beer and man did they! They had a draft menu that must've had about 30 ish beers to choose from! They're known for their pizzas but I decided to take a risk and go with the chicken pesto sandwich! I was pleasantly surprised! Taste was great and the bread was a cheese covered French bread! People were raving about their waffle fries and they really are fantastic! It's also a seat yourself establishment and the bartenders were very knowledgeable about the beers and attentive!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, good vibe, and they carry my hometown beer Sierra Nevada. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Boulders on Broadway is the perfect place to catch the game. It has a lot of space and a great vibe. Not to mention a ton of beers on tap and half-off bottle deals (actually - they have a lot of deals, it's the type of place that has some sort of special every night.)  It's also the kind of place where you can get to know the staff if you stop in regularly.   The food is fairly good for a bar - still have a lot of the greasy favorites (and they are favorites for a reason) but there are also some decent salads and such.   I've never really had a bad time at Boulders and it's becoming a go-to place to hang out with a large group of people."}
{"text":"This place is the epitome of your neighborhood bar.  Great place to get drunk at.  I would venture to say that this was one of the highlights of this neighborhood.  I started going here long before they even had the outdoor patio.  Yeah I knew about this place before it was cool.  Suck on that, hipsters.    Their food has improved by leaps and bounds.  I can happily eat their pizza now.  The California carver is especially good.  I wouldn't say its 5 star good but its worthy of bar food.  The 5 stars is for the atmosphere.    If you ever want some sage advice on a brew, ask the resident employee Chris Shinn.  His suggestions will not disappoint.    They are packed every Tuesday for trivia.  Be wary of the cheating redditors that play upstairs.  They don't leave their parents basement that often, therefore they don't understand that looking up the answer on your cell phone is frowned upon.    All in all this is a solid place to get a brew and some food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I would, and do, recommend this place to anyone. Although they get busy at times and the servers are overwhelmed, the food is always perfect. The owner is such a nice guy!!"}
{"text":"The food and service are both fine here, but I've experienced better. I love love love that this is so close to my house. My husband and I walk over there a lot, usually later at night to enjoy the late night happy hour. The atmosphere of the place is intriguing to me. I don't know if I love it or hate it. It is dark, and oh Lawdy those bathrooms are atrocious. Worse than any I have ever encountered, not exaggerating. I want to love this place even more since it's so close, but I'm just not feelin it yet. It is fun to go out there, but the place itself is just okay to me. I am not a big fan of beer, but my husband is constantly ordering different beers and it makes him happy so I guess I'm happy too. Except for that one time he bought an $18 bottle of beer and nobody warned him it would cost that much. That was no fun and I feel like somebody should have mentioned that it was so costly since they recommended it. For shame. But yeah, I like it here and I will continue to come back on a fairly regular basis for sure."}
{"text":"The half pound burger was tasty enough but did not seem like really a half pound. More like the 3rd pound. The pork sandwich was just average. The manager came over to check on us than we told her about how we thought the portions are pretty small. She was pleasant enough to talk to And apologize that we were totally satisfied. That's it."}
{"text":"Boulders sits in an old Old Chicago franchise with some reworking done to make it somewhat bike-oriented. It's in a weird area, on Broadway between Priest and Mill, and a little difficult to find because the sign on Broadway is fairly small. We came for the $5 sandwiches and $3 beer that were advertised on their web site for their all-day Saturday happy hour. When we finally stumbled upon the place, the entrance was fairly hard to find. It's in the back. Upon entering, you find a cavernous, two-story, multi-leveled, dimly lit restaurant with tons of big booths and various separated rooms. Kind of strange. Almost completely empty. I got a look at the menu and immediately realized that the special was actually $6 sandwiches and $3.50 beers on tap. Whatever. The draft selection is a little bit better than you'd find at an Old Chicago location, with some Dogfish Heads, a Rogue and a Ska. They also had a Deschutes red on tap, which I had never had, that wasn't on the menu because it was so new. A lot of the beers are not available for the happy hour prices, such as the aforementioned Dogfish Heads and Ska. So I opted for the Rogue Dead Guy Ale and started looking at the menu. They have quite a bottles selection too, leaving off a lot of the American crap (Bud, Coors, etc.), which I really admire in places, and sticking to the more well-known micros, with a few Four Peaks and that Papago orange stuff to round out the locals. They even had a couple of Nimbuses (Tucson). The bottles were not on special, but I prefer draft beer anyway. The sandwiches and burgers list was a bit more than I had expected. Chicken, turkey, a sirloin (not available as the $6 special) and a couple of veggie options. For sides, they had salads, fries (waffle) and their new, housemade potato chips. I had the southwest turkey with the chips. Those chips are basically thick pieces of potato, lightly fried with a bit of seasoning. They were very good, and I was glad that I got them. The sandwich was nice: deli turkey, cheese and a bit of chipotle sauce for a little kick. My girlfriend got the burger, and I was a bit jealous. It was a rectangular patty on what looked like a ciabatta bun. She said it was one of the best burgers she had in a while and actually finished the thing off, which is really rare for her. Service was good. I felt bad that there were so few people in there, but the guy was really, really nice and attentive. Two beers and the sandwich ended up $13 just for me, which is a pretty good deal when you think about it. Downside is that it's a little dingy inside. They should probably work a bit on cleaning the place up. Maybe get some sort of interior design consultant to come in and revamp the place a bit. Also, the location is just so weird. I've stayed at that Motel 6 across the street years ago, and I never thought I'd opt to spend any additional time in that neighborhood. But I would definitely go back, and would recommend it to those who like their beer. Maybe a good alternative to Four Peaks since they're perpetually packed, although some people may be scared off by the atmosphere here. Give it a chance!"}
{"text":"Boulders has been my go-to neighborhood bar for a while (BEER LIST), but really exceeded my expectations this week, and merited a review.   I recently coordinated a professional development event for the graduate students in my department. We wanted a place with good beer and food, but also that had a private room that was quiet enough that we could talk. This doesn't seem like a tall order, but Boulders was the only place we knew that had a private, quiet room. I've seen a chess club meet in there a few times.  We had a large party of 15, and we were seated in the \"lounge,\" a room off the main dining area with a booth, a large table, and a door! The room was perfect, and everyone was able to hear the professor that came to speak to us. Our server Jake took excellent care of our group, and was really respectful and deft at delivering orders, refilling waters, and getting additional rounds of beer without interrupting our speaker. He even closed the door quietly as he came and went. I felt like the staff really went above and beyond to accommodate us, and the meeting went off without a hitch thanks to their help.  Thank you, Boulders! I don't think we'll ever meet on campus again. :)"}
{"text":"Got the fish and chips and left with no regrets. I was sick as a dog so I couldn't really enjoy the atmosphere or food but my family LOVES this place so I trust them.   The place is huge inside with tons of seating and parking is easy. Bathrooms were a little mehhhh but I ain't mad.   4 Stars Boulders. Ya killin' it!!!"}
{"text":"The beer list here is GREAT. Seriously. If you like craft brews, go here.  The food is meh. There are a lot of really interesting combinations, but the execution wasnt the best. The service is also meh. All 8 of us had to be wary when our waitress came around to tell her that so and so needed something too. She would take one or two orders at a time.   Seriously though, the beer is awesome."}
{"text":"I don't have much bad to say about Boulder's but since there isn't an ability to give a fractional star this place gets 5.  Honestly the beer selection on it's own would be enough to get 5 stars for me.  Between the rotating draft beer selection and the bottle/can list there's pretty much something for every taste.  The bar staff is knowledgeable when it comes to what they have, especially Justin, Dave, and Alex, so if you want a recommendation they won't point you in the wrong direction.  The bar is fairly laid back most of the time but can get rowdy during ASU games.  It's more of a neighborhood bar than a sports bar so there aren't a ton of tv's, but they do open early on the weekends (9 or 10am) so people do come in for early morning soccer some times.  They run different specials pretty much every day of the week.  I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered from their food menu.  Usually I'll go with a burger and while they are all good, for my preference I usually go for the Asian Bob with a Ceasar Salad instead of the waffle fries.  The Bombay Street Dog was at one point a summer only item which has found a permant place on the menu after appearing in Phoenix New Times article \"Our 10 Favorite Spicy Dishes in Metro Phoenix\" last year.  If you are there for breakfast, everything I've had is good.  My recommendation would be the Chuck Norris Scramble and a Bloody Mary (it has bacon in it)."}
{"text":"This was my first time after being around 3 years. I had a restriction to this place as it gets crowded with college students.   Good for beers from micro-breweries specially when they are 1/2 off!! Still the can and bottle won't beet the draft.   Food? we only had the frigging nachos, that are gooooood for their crispiness. More I wouldn't dare."}
{"text":"Your typical bar/grill menu. Really nothing to go to for food, just compliments your beer you're ordering. The dining areas along the bar are rather dirty, or at least were when I was there, especially the menus themselves. They stuck to one another and we're stained. If they can't clean something as simple as menus, makes me worry what the kitchen looks like."}
{"text":"My local bar, Boulders is a four minute walk from my house and I love it. They have a very large and always changing beer selection and a great crowd every night to hang out with. This is not a college bar, you could run into anyone here, young or old. The food is good, but it is bar food, this is not a gourmet spot, but I love their big freaking nachos and fish n chips. My only particular gripe is the jukebox... the music is either really good or it makes you want to leave... but with the best happy hours in town and friendly atmosphere, it's a very minor complaint. I am here at least every Thursday night with some pals and I don't see that changing any time soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! The food is always amazing, and they have a great selection of beer! Today we had the pleasure of being served by Kristin at the bar top. It was seriously the best service we have had in a very long time including any other restaurant that we frequent! She was friendly, fast, and made the experience the best we've had at this establishment! Thank you Kristin!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. I had a dinner salad that acted like a side salad. Not enough of any of the ingredients to make it worthy of a dinner salad. The grape vinaigrette was the perfect mix of sweet and vinegar."}
{"text":"A couple of the managers, Rob and Ben, helped me pull off a very random request.  I first spoke with them on the phone and they were both more than willing to help.  I came it and dropped off some items to Rob and again, without any explanation needed on my end, said he would take care of it.  Sure enough everything was setup the way I asked and they let the servers know as well, so I didn't get any confused looks.  I can't thank you enough for such amazing service and BONUS, the food was absolutely delicious!  I had the pesto quesadilla and my booth mate had a mouthwatering hamburger with waffle cut fries...mmmmmm!  I lacked in getting the servers name, but she was very attentive and wonderful!  Thank you Boulders On Broadway for amazing service!  I cannot wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I come to PHX once or twice a year on business.  I LOVE THIS BAR. Pizza (kaiser) burgers (moose drool), and just super nice people. As for the beer, I have found my two new favorites. \"I drink Ambers\" 90 Shillings and FW DBA.. Stay Classy Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Try the Chuck Norris Pizza.  Full of Meat and get it with the Thin Crust.  It holds up with all the meat toppings."}
{"text":"Okay, this was recommended by a friend who had their holiday party catered upstairs. I was not expecting BEST WINGS EVER!!!!! It is a hipster place with TONS of seating and great burgers and wings. This is what I know of it so far. They have private room for parties, LOTS of craft brews of every sort.  Bike and car parking (unlike Four Peaks).   This is not \"upscale\" it is very relaxed, calming and the food is the same, nothing hugely complicated but lots to choose from. Wings are standard buffalo, (see pic), we ordered some of differing heat and none were beyond medium for my taste. I like them hotter but the meat was cooked properly and they were crispy.   You can also sit outside with the out of control misters.  It's good for your lungs, like a humidifier in the outdoors. I will highly recommend this place for happy hour, which is every hour."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and it is a great dive bar. We have tried going on our lunch break, because our work is right down the street. Everytime we are late, but the food is pretty decent bar food! They have an awesome beer selection, and last time I went I had a great belgium! This is a cool little hipster bar that I am definitely returning to:)"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and the more I go, the more of a fan I become. They have an awesome beer selection (not that they have a bunch of taps, but the ones they have are awesome!). If you enjoy craft beer, they have something for you. Me and my girlfriend like to come here for happy hour and get an assortment of pizza-related apps and stick around for Trivia Night! This place is surprisingly big so it's great for lunch, happy hour, dinner or big group get-togethers. I'm definitely a fan! :D"}
{"text":"YES!!! and YES and YES!! too bad i don't live closer. I really love this place.  They get a huge four stars off the bat because they are supporters of Pedal Craft. I love that!!  Boulders has a great tap selection that fluctuates often. The food is good. Not great, but the atmosphere easily makes up for it.   It is a dive that you could go to every day and even take a casual date to without feeling like you're slumming it.   Dive bars = win  Bars that love cycling = 5 star win.  I prefer this to the big brewery places closer to that community college down the road...  BEAR DOWN!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Boulders on Broadway every Thursday night with a group of friends since August. I love it. The atmosphere is really laid-back and on Thursdays many of their bottled beers are half-off. I have only eaten there a few times but each time the food was delicious. I highly recommend the steak and walnut salad as well as their home-made potato chips. Boulders is the perfect place to go if you are looking for some place low-key."}
{"text":"Good pub style food with a selection of pizzas, burgers, sandwiches & appetizers. Best part for me was the excellent beer selection."}
{"text":"We ate here while visiting from out of town, and were very pleased. The pizza was good, salad was very good, beer selection was great, and the service was outstanding. Delicious chocolate chip cookies sundae for desert too."}
{"text":"Trivia night on Sunday and Tuesday is lots of fun Their draft beer changes all the time which is nice but I wish the beer list had the beer type and alcohol percentage included It'd make choosing a lot easier . Definitely try the Traveler Illusive draft if they have it in though"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after helping a mate move house who lives just down the street. Came down for lunch and actually ended coming back the same evening. Nice bar, friendly staff and good location. This bar has a nice selection of beers on tap and the food (bar) is good. I had a salad and it was fresh and the dressing tasty. I think I found a new place to hit when I'm visiting my friends and its walking distance which makes it even better!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Tempe for the first time on business, and jumped at the chance of my work colleague, Vince, going out to lunch (just so that I could try the local hangouts); we kind of looked at him funny when he non-chalantly said something 'bout \"boulders\" ...  ...and it's no wonder that not all of us knew what he was talkin' bout, cuz it's pretty discreet-looking, and located in a building that came right out of the 80's. You wouldn't know right off-the-bat if this was a restaurant/bar, and with the interesting name and all, that makes it all the more intriguing.  Being a cyclist myself, I knew it was a good sign when I noticed the interior bike parking! It looks like a pretty cool, laid-back, and non-pretentious atmosphere with younger-gen worker bees and clientele mixed with wood-trim decor, a bar, and TVs in the background.  It wasn't at all deserted, and though not necessarily packed, was fairly full with people, and looked to be a well-known neighborhood hangout, and I thought that this was a good sign.   The menu was fairly descriptive, and made me want to order everything on the menu. It consists of your typical bar-food, but all changed-up with their own special twist.  They had something called the \"Big Freakin' Nacho\" (lightly fried chips topped with mozarella, sausage, olives, and peppers) and upon advice from my colleague, went with the half order (at $7.49) since I heard that they mean business when they say, \"big.\" I ordered this with EXTRA cheese.  I also went with the Costa Rican Cesar. My colleagues ordered other items such as the wings, pizza nuggets, the burger, etc.  The service -   Our waitress was pleasant, took our drink and food order, and all-in-all, the service was relatively quick considering the decent size of our party of 8. She was pretty attentive the whole entire time!  On to the food -   The salad was fairly good, and was a good portion. People can screw up salad, yet what I got was what I'd expect from a place of this genre.  I ordered my nachos with extra cheese, yet they were pretty far from cheesy. In fact, I kind of think that it's the cheese that is the GLUE that holds it together in nachos, so with every bite, I either had nothing but \"chip\", or I had stuff rolling off of it.   Note that I didn NOT complain or send it back because even for a \"half\" portion, it still came out on a pizza tray full of chips, and I pretty much felt like (if I complained), all they were gonna do was just add the cheese and heat up the platter of chips again, which would've made them stale...  Other than this one thing though, the taste formula is pretty right-on, the chips tasted like they were fried in-house, and as the menu described, they tasted light. They could've been so much better though with that extra cheese it needed.  I tried the Pizza Nuggets, and they were good - tasted like pizza sauce and cheese slathered on soft bread. The wings were just so-so (good, but not quite good enough to give me that wow factor).  If I could I'd give this place 3.5 stars; they'd be a 4-star if they somehow stepped up the quality just a tad-bit -   ...they seem to have the right formula going, and their food is unique enough; good enough taste-wise, and large enough portion-wise, yet, in my humble opinion, they need to step it up to make that difference between the thought of \"food just being thrown together\" vs. really going for that wow factor.  ...I'd most-definitely come here agian, though."}
{"text":"This place is great for the beer lovers.  They have tons of beer on tap and even more bottled ones.  They have the small brewery offerings that are missing at so many places.    I am judging it almost entirely on the beer alone.  We ordered some nachos which were some odd twist on nachos.  I was unaware something as classic as nachos needed fixing.  I'll stick with the classic.  It seems a lot of bicycle riders patronize this joint which I guess is cool... if you ride a bike.  The building is unique and quite large.  There was a guy playing music when we were there.  I went several months ago and might go again, but I think I would prefer to keep trying new places in search of a gem."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Unique decorations, great atmosphere, great beer, and good service. Our server was really sweet and helpful. She seems to really enjoy her job!   The beer is really good and so are the wings and pizza!  I would advise against the margaritas unless you really like them sweet! I liked mine, but I love sweet drinks.  Definitely a good place to come with a group of friends."}
{"text":"My girl and I come here around once a week on average. Always a great beer selection. The chicken bruschetta is supremely delicious. Everything I've had here has been great. Also and as important is the staff who is the best. Isaac is usually my server and he makes it interesting and awesome everytime."}
{"text":"My husband loves micro brews but I'm not a beer drinker. At Boulders hr gets great beer, and I enjoy the food and wine. Their mahi salad is so awesome!"}
{"text":"One of the social groups I belong to has a group that goes to Boulders on Broadway on Sundays for trivia night. I have been a couple of times, but this place just bores me. The beer list is long, but there isn't anything on it that rocks my boat. The food looks and tastes like decent bar food, but just not exciting. The service tends to be slow, but in my experience trivia nights can be overwhelming, so I don't hold that against them. It is just a very blah place."}
{"text":"We stopped by after a show at ASU.  My cousin was wondering about this place when we drove up. When we entered the place was packed with people playing \"Trivia Night\". We were greeted by Mary, who served us all evening. She is very nice and is a hard worker. Between taking care of us, she was busy cleaning all the tables after Trivia Night.  We are a party of seven and all ordered something different from the menu.   We ALL like the food, especially my niece was was skeptical about the place to begin with.  Overall a pleasant evening and experience."}
{"text":"We arrived a few hours before trivia started. We had a party of 7. The staff INSISTED we sit in a big trivia room, saying \"oh we don't have any parties tonight, you're fine.\" Right before trivia started the manager comes up and passive aggressively starts saying \"oh we usually use this room for trivia, moving forward you guys really shouldn't be in this room...\"   A while later we invited a group of people into our room for trivia because they needed seating. We weren't planning on playing trivia. And the other group got yelled at because there were more than 12 people in be room...even though we weren't playing trivia!   We also ordered nachos that came out wrong...they comped us and brought out a second order of nachos...those were burnt to hell. As if this wasn't bad enough, the entire time we were there (paying customers, eating and having drinks) multiple servers kept coming by asking if we were done, as if to hurry us out the door!   This was the first and last time I will EVER go there. What a terrible experience. I would not recommend going there. The ONLY good part of this experience was our server (the receipt said his name was Delicious???). Whatever his name is, he was so sweet and attentive. Everyone else sucked."}
{"text":"Place is cool, super casual but clean and food is pretty decent.  Service is always good and I like the atmosphere.  Usually end up here for a lunch meeting and it seems to always go well so how can I complain.  I have had the fish tacos, calzone, and burger so far.  Looks like we are going to meet here once per month so I will have to keep you posted on any gems I find on top of everything else.  Peace"}
{"text":"Awesome bar and grill! The beer app, while not always working, is a great touch. Everything I have ordered has always been excellent especially the unique hot dog dishes and the quesadilla."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour a few weeks ago with a friend. I am not a huge beer fan, but they have an awesome selection. Their wine selection isn't that great...but I already figured that going in. We decided to order a few things off the happy hour menu and share a sandwich. We tried the crispy artichokes and beer queso. Both were excellent. We shared the honey chicken sandwich and waffle fries, which was delicious as well.   Overall, everything was great and will definitely return next time I am in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection. Great pizza. The server Austin is delicious. They have trivia often. A great happy hour selection. Sweet potato tots are fire. You can join their club and get neat deals through out the week. Super litty fire, fam."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE! Only pay cash here or don't open a tab!!!   The bartender charged another persons tab on my card and then gave them my card. After he told me what happened, he proceeded to ask me if I had cash to pay my tab! The guy that the bartender gave my card to then proceeded to spend a ton of money at Circle K. Huge inconvenience!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places I can see why people really like it, but I just didn't really like it (it was A-OK, though).   I really do like the place itself. The rock-climbing/bicycle theme is cool. There's two stories of seating with a large wrap around bar and a large patio (that's dog friendly, I believe). There's a very unpretentious vibe. I don't come to this area often, but it seems very post-ASU (and beyond), and that seems to be reflected in the crowd that comes here.   Here's the thing though...food, service, and beer selection (although this is debatable depending on what you like) isn't all that great. Admittedly, I'm basing this on one visit. Service was particularly questionable. Me & a friend were sitting at a table right by the bar and basically it seemed to be server by committee. A couple of bartenders would occasionally check on us &  I think a waitress who was actually working the floor came by twice. They were all friendly though (just not very attentive).  As for food, we ordered two HH items and I think that may have been the issue. There's like 7-8 items that are $3.99. That's a really good deal, but the portions are pretty small & you get what you pay for. We ordered the nachos and afterwards I heard a waitress tell the table next to us they were better off ordering the \"regular\" nachos instead of the HH ones if they were hungry. I wish I had heard this beforehand. The nachos tasted fine, but the HH portion comes in large soup bowl. Minutes later the table next to us got a ginormous, beautiful looking platter. I would have happily paid the $4-5 extra dollars for that and would have been set, instead of ordering another okay-ish HH item (tater tots in our case).   I'm not really beer expert (by any means), but I didn't think the selection here was that great (I say this because that seems to be a huge emphasis for this place). They didn't seem to have many beers you wouldn't normally find at a place that has a large tap selection.  I'd come back here if someone suggested it, but I wouldn't be the one doing the suggesting."}
{"text":"The Boulders is finding its niche and for the bicycle, i'm getting my drink on crowd, they are fitting in well. However, the food has well, fallen in my estimation. Average bar food is what is being served. Gone are the plans for a beer dinner with pairings and quality dining. It has been replaced with quick foods of pizzas, strombolis and nachos. Not particularly sparkling but gets the job done when your main attraction is beer and Boulders does do beer well.  The staff has slipped into an easy, we serve those we know best and well, the rest of you, not so much. The bar has an easy 20 something feel, and its' patronage reflects it."}
{"text":"Not really feeling the clientele. People at the bar are quiet and cool but others in the restaurant are dipshits. I also didn't feel much from the server."}
{"text":"Boulders is one of my regular spots in Phoenix. I love the beer list.  There is always a good variety on the tap.  There is an app you can download to check out the selection.   They also have a full bar. The food is typical bar food.  Sandwiches, pizza, calzones, salads, burgers.  It's a-ight.  I usually just stick with their appetizers.  They overdress the hell out of their salads to the point that it's soupy.   The service is generally good in the bar area; but that's what happens when you become a barfly I guess...they're nice to the regulars.  They have a largish outdoor seating area where you can smoke.   They have a great happy hour.  There is always an eclectic group of customers.  I've met some good peeps here. The  jukebox is pretty stupendous.   Televisions show the sports.   They are really into biking and have some bike nights.   They have a very popular trivia night."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, really I did. They have amazing happy hour specials every day of the week, trivia, cool atmosphere, all the makings of a really, great bar. Unfortunately, it just.....wasn't.   All the hipsters gather to enjoy their beer that's on tap but \"oh sorry, we're out of that.\" The employees have no idea what the specials are and it's not clearly listed anywhere so it's a guessing game.   Our waitress forgot items, which I understand, but did not come by for several minutes to check if everything had arrived correctly.   However, I did enjoy my burger which was lacking the toppings I ordered. I'm not passive aggressive or anything.   My momma always said if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything. So......"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I'd been here years ago when it was Old Chicago, and a few times after it had changed to Boulders. I always had a good time due to the company, but it's just your average hang out restaurant. I came here for trivia night on Sat and the host at the door kindly informed us that we could seat ourselves at the bar or be seated somewhere in the GIANT restaurant. There are so many nooks it's crazy. We decided to sit at the bar and quickly found a table. It was busy, lots of people there for late dinners and trivia as we found out. Our server was nice and we indulged mostly in beers, and ended the night with two HH apps as we were starting to get hungry. A funny exchange I had while wanting to order food:  Me to bus boy: Hi! What's the difference between the mexican nachos and boulder nachos? (we didn't have a dinner menu) Bus boy: The chips (walks away)  Me and my bf just had to laugh. Later when our server came by we found out that there is a lot more different than just the chips.   I can't speak to the quality of their entrees, as we only had mozz sticks and mexican nachos, but we'll be back for trivia and beer."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of trying this establishment with friends  during trivia night.  The place was packed and service although friendly was hard to get.  The half off appetizers were great but the wings I got were just so-so. The selection of craft beers was latger than Iwas expecting.  Since I am new to the region I was unfamiliar with most of them. Unfortunately it was a work night so I couldn't really experiment. The brombere I had was worth a try if you like sour beers.   I would be willing to come back with friends to hang out and grab a beer if we're in the area.  Most likely wouldn't go out of my way to swing by though."}
{"text":"I ordered the Nachos which is just a huge try of fried wantons with cheese, pepperoni and some type of meat. That tasted interesting but it was a huge tray for $10.00.  My friends ordered a Sausage Pizza which had hot dog meat for sausage. The Chicken Alfredo tasted like the hot dogs which some weird cream.   For my waffle fries I was given cocktail sauce instead of ketchup... wtf.  i'm never going here again."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place that a lot of people frequent. It has a cool vibe to it and it caters to the biking community. There's a bike co-op across the street and even indoor bike racks. I came here with a group for Trivia Night and had a fun time playing with them while enjoying Happy Hour beers and sharing appetizers. I'm a huge fan of stouts, so I was glad to see more than just 1 or 2 stouts on tap; I opted for the Boulders Chocolate Shake stout and was very pleased!   We got a plate of nachos, french fries, jalapeno poppers, and something called Italian Nachos. Essentially, they were pita-like chips served with pizza toppings and red sauce. They were interesting and tasted good, but I can't say that I would get them again. To each their own!   Overall, it was a nice and laid-back environment for catching up with friends."}
{"text":"Happy hour apps just went up to $3.99 from $2.99.   Bad and few TVs. Not high def.   No beer descriptions.   Out of Dale's Deviant Ale cans. Out of spicy pickles appetizer!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and watch Sunday Football.  Good food selection and excellent service."}
{"text":"Got the bfn and wasn't too impressed, not much meat, I guess I was expecting more. I'm willing to try it again when in town."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! This is my neighborhood bar! Great beer,  yoummy food, fun atmosphere, awesome staff and trivia! I love it, so much fun!!!!!"}
{"text":"Boulders can be an up and down one for me. Currently the staff has been better then they were in the past, this place does have a niche crowd, and a lot of their regulars know each other and converse and it can be cool at times and other times the regulars can make people feel very unwanted . they make the place their own which is cool but it can be a bit daunting and un welcoming for people who havent been here before . the beer choices are always on point . the food is hit and miss the pizza is decent . the wings are not suggested . over priced small and dry. The sandwiches are okay their other apps are all pretty decent ."}
{"text":"Ummmm, I like what they've done with the place!  I still remember this as an Old Chicago, and I think this is better.  Great beer list!  Friendly and helpful staff!  But.......  The bathrooms were not well maintained and stinky (like you could smell them as you approach) and the menu appeared rather uninspired yet pricey.  This place needs to decide whether it's more dive bar or gastro pub, and then maybe I'll jump fully on board."}
{"text":"good hamburgers and good hefeveisen. i love the downstairs private room for our sport group meetings and the waitress comes in alot and brings beer. 2 thumbs up on that and a double like!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice staff huge beer selection. Pizza is not hitting any home runs, but the place is great for hanging out and having drinks, apps are delicious."}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood bar. Super chill atmosphere, 30 beers on tap, and appetizers are awesome! Dogs are also welcome on their outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for my lunch break they get my food out quickly and the staff is very friendly!!#"}
{"text":"Always Sunny on TV several delicious beers on tap and they have a pizza called \"The Chuck Norris\" and its all the animal toppings!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch there today for my first time because I had too me up for business. This place was awesome! Great staff, great food and great environment! Had the Bacon wrapped shrimp pasta and it was Amazing! I will be back again and next time will be for drinks! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Recap: the food was pretty decent, they have a good craft beer list, but unfortunately the service was awful.  Let me get this out of the way at the beginning regarding the service. The waiter was very friendly and knowledgable about both the menu and craft beer selection. I wish I got his name because he deserves credit for how hard he was busting his ass. Unfortunately he was the only waiter in the dining room area and no single man could handle that many tables and the device definitely suffered. I put this in the management for not having proper coverage.   We picked this place based on yelp reviews and the \"all day happy hour\".  All day happy hour on a Saturday afternoon? Sold.   The atmosphere is pretty good for a bar and grill. They have the typical beer memorabilia hanging from the walls. It was seat yourself when we arrived and we chose to sit in the dining room. The bar area looked pretty large and had several high table tops to sit at.   The waiter provided us the beer list and we were happy to see so many different craft beers. We all ordered to our likings. Unfortunately the service was slow and the beers were empty and sat empty on our tables prior to getting refilled. I would have drank a few more but time didn't allow.   The food was typical American bar and grill grub. I had a calzone that was surprisingly good. The marinara sauce here is something special. Highly recommend the sauce. I ordered a pepperoni gravy to go with it and it just seemed a weird combination mixed with calzone.   The wings were delish. We had basic buffalo sauce and a firehouse wings. They were well cooked and sauced properly. Appetizers were jalapeño tots and spicy fried pickles. The tots had a pleasant kick of spice but not too much to be unenjoyable. I hate pickles but was told they were mediocre and lacked spice for spicy pickles.   Overall the food was good and the beers were good. I would like to go back again when they have proper staffing levels and would expect my rating to jump up another star ranking."}
{"text":"Half off of pizzas on Monday. They also have an app that tells you what beers they currently have on draught. Justin is an excellent bartender who can recommend a beer...or two.  They also have an excellent salmon burger."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Sunday and the food was really good. Everyone at my table enjoyed their food. The service was amazing. They recommended 12 west for the beer and I think I found my new favorite beer.   They offer happy hour all day Sunday.   We will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday and I was so happy with the entire experience. Our waitress was so awesome and attentive, we had a manger check on us during our meal, and the food was so awesome! I am bummed that I have lived so close to it for the past few years and have never tried it before! We found out Mondays are 1/2 price pizza so that was a great surprise. Definitely will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I like this place but as stated by some previous Yelpers, the service staff is a bit... special.  The last time we were in, our server smelled of Patchouli Oil and cigarette smoke.  Not appetizing at all.  We usually get the pizza nacho things but I am dying to try the Elvis pizza one of these times.  They always have a great selection of beer on tap - a little something for everyone."}
{"text":"It's just your average pub, albeit with an above average beer selection.   The interior is cozy and warm. There are some sports on, but with no sound. There's plenty of seating, and it's great for large groups. The waitstaff are nice, and the kitchen is quick.   The waffle fries are *amazing* but the fried fish, pizza, and probably other items are just OK. I would never, ever go out of my way to come here for anything but pints with my friends. But if you're dragged in, it's not the end of the world."}
{"text":"If it would be possible to give this place a half a star or less I probably would. Met a friend for drinks on a Thursday night at 8 o'clock, took half an hour for them to come get our order. Took another 20 minutes to get my drink which was supposed to be a strawberry margarita. I cannot be for sure if there was even alcohol in it they don't own a blender so it wasn't blended and it tasted bitter as if it was old alcohol. In the two and a half hours my friend and I SAT there chatting the guy came back only once to ask my friend if he wanted another beer. Then it took almost an hour for us to get the check so we could leave. Definitely not a place I will be going back to. I kinda feel sorry for my friend who is in town on business who definitely didn't get to enjoy himself.   The table was sticky upon sitting down, the place is very dated. It is most definitely not wheelchair friendly as there  are steps everywhere and I didn't see a wheelchair ramp anywhere. I ordered the cookie with ice cream on top it was so over cooked it was crispy and not very fresh.  The only good thing was that they took my margarita off the bill since the waiter saw that I had barely drank any of it."}
{"text":"I usually come here for trivia. The food is actually really good. Typical bar food, but it tastes great. Prices are reasonable. Gluten-free options for the man.   Beer selection used to be better. Substantially less cider than they had a year ago.   Staff is always friendly.   Hipster crowd, but they found it before it was cool so let them stay."}
{"text":"For St. Patty's Day my friends and I were looking for a place that had a decent bar, a few TV's, good food and maybe a pool table/ or a dartboard. We were in Tempe on vacation so we're looking around. Looking on Yelp we settled on Boulders On Broadway. It ended up being a real good choice. Plenty of parking and easy to find. As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a smile and warm welcome. It's a simple gesture but other places seem to forget to do it. Good nachos and deep dish pizza. We spent a good four hours drinking and eating, watching NCAA tournament basketball and playing darts. No pool table here but fun was had by all.  Even played some songs on the jukebox. The jukebox was hooked up to the TouchTones phone app. So we could pick songs from our phone without getting up. You just pay for credits and pick songs on your phone. It was easy. Overall, a great bar to relax with friends. Not too rowdy and lots of booths for some privacy if needed. Great customer service. The crew working there are very patron friendly. Support local business especially the good ones. In Tempe is Boulders On Broadway. A gem of a bar/ pizza joint. Eat and drink here."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. They have a huge selection of beers on tap and in bottles I have never seen so much in one place. The odd thing is I have never heard about this place till I started working down in Tempe, but once I tried it I will drive across town on the weekends even when I am not working to go here. I suggest trying the Pizza and the Pizza Nachos, they are my absolute favorites. This place gets PACKED in the evenings and on weekends but it is a casual environment and is highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times, going back to when it was a Old Chicago's.  On our latest trip I couldn't help but notice a really foul musty moldy aroma that really turned me off.  The food was good as was the beer, just got the feeling that the clenliness may be going downhill."}
{"text":"I visited this place twice for trivia night, which was fun and it's during happy hour so prices for appetizers, like wings and fried pickles were cheap. Get the jalapeño poppers. The staff is attentive too. You do have to download their app to view their beer menu. I assume that it rotates frequently, however, on both nights, when I selected a drink, the server would say they just ran out. If they're going to be that technologically advanced, then maybe the menu should be real time. Haha.  The food is good, the beer is good, trivia was fun, the staff was friendly. What more can you ask for? I'm sure I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I picked this place out to meet up with a friend because it was somewhere half way between where both of us lived and it wasn't right in the heart of ASU so we didn't have to deal with the traffic near and around ASU.. this place was pretty decent, good music and a nice selection of beers on draft and bottles/cans.. we shared a big plate of nachos which consisted of cheese,pepperoni,sausage, banana peppers and Olives.. and small marinara sauce..  the only thing I'm taking a star out of the ratings is because they got our bills mixed up.. so our bill was more then it should have been.. which was no biggie but I don't get how you can get a bill mixed up with a different table.. but other then that everything was good"}
{"text":"I would've never stepped foot into this place if I were to judge it by its exterior alone. It looks like it could serve as the location shot for a post-apocalyptic prison planet sci-fi film. Just a big ol' concrete box sitting on a patch of asphalt, with no indication of life inside. But maybe I'm being a bit hyperbolic.  Upon entering I was greeted with all the coziness of a comfortable college beer bar. You can tell they take beer here seriously from all of the bric-a-brac on the walls and the selection of tap handles. My inaugural visit to this fine watering hole was incited by a meetup with fellow beer lovers, the occasion being a beer tasting and learn-in conducted by a visiting beer scholar from Odell Brewing Company. I was late so I didn't join in the beer class, so I plunked down my happy ass with my fellow beer fans, and resolved to do my studying by osmosis. I ordered a delicious Odell Myrcenary Double IPA which satisfied my inner beer baby.  All this quaffing, and joking, and jostling, and elbowing of the ribs (and things of this nature) made me hungry for the local fare. I decided I would sample the wings here. I was not disappointed! The wings they served me were more of a dry variety. This makes for a very crispy wing, which is KEY, so they definitely get points for that. As for the Jamaican Jerk wings, there was no sauce, but a generous dusting of spices that were both elusive and delicious (I'm almost certain I detected ginger and allspice). I also ordered their Smokin' Jalapeno Firehouse wings... which I thought at first would be too spicy. The cornerstone of this slightly wetter spice treatment is a rub made of red jalapeño peppers. Despite my fear, I dove in, ignoring the flames of Hell engulfing me, and got down-and-dirty with those tasty winglets. These wings are good!! And since they're drier than most, they are perfectly suited for generous dipping in ranch or blue cheese. There's also something suspiciously crack-like about the blue cheese dressing here... it is otherworldly!  This place is the perfect escape from the drudgery of the wage slave work week.  Throw off the shackles, ignore both moons that are glowing purple, and hunker down here with your fellow inmates for some great beer and some amazing wings."}
{"text":"Staff was helpful, friendly & attentive which is awesome for a seat yourself establishment. Loved the different sections of seating; we were a large party of 8 with 2 small children & were able to be in a separate room with a large table. It was nice to have the space to ourselves but still feel the ambiance of the restaurant. Every thing was great that we ordered (shrimp tacos, mahi-mahi tacos, kid's make your own pizzas, jerk chicken wings, big freaking nachos, waffle fries & cheesy beef sandwich). I had the cheesy beef sandwich & it was very yummy. The star for me was the bread, it was fresh & tasted baked in house. The aus jus was also very good. Bathrooms were clean with an interesting setup but not giving it way. If we didn't live in Kansas this would became a regular haunt for us."}
{"text":"I love coming here for two things: big freaking nachos and beer. I've tried multiple entrees here and really nothing has been good. These include their calzones, pastas, salads, strombolis...ok their moose drool burger is A-OK I'll give them that, but most everything else-- I was left with disappointment. Well, back to the big freakin nachos.. these are the greatest thing invented. Seriously hard to explain, its got chips (that are more like a fried wonton/pizza crust) and all the best pizza toppings like cheese, pepperoni, sausage (and more) with a side of marinara. I swear this order is HUGE (probably on a Large pizza dish) and could potentially feed a large group but I could probably eat the whole thing by myself due to its tastiness. Its always crowded and parking can be a problem on trivia nights but its a cool place for some brews and big freakin nachos."}
{"text":"I love the pizza at this place and the giant salads with blue cheese dressing. This really is one of my favorite lunch spots to go with my co-workers. They are friendly and the service fast."}
{"text":"We come here all the time for Team Trivia.  It's a great atmosphere for that, as there are often over 30 teams competing.  The food isn't bad - it's pretty typical for bar food, for the most part.  Nothing really stands out to me though, that I'd recommend.  The best part about this place is definitely their beer selection.  They've got a ton of bottles and beers on draft and are always rotating seasonal selections in."}
{"text":"Beer selection great, atmosphere like an out of place ski lodge in the desert, pool tables partial broken....not much else to say.  I guess this place is a decent place to go once to check it out, I can't say I would bother going again. I guess between the extremely bright lights, and eclectic ski lodgian decor, it just doesn't tickle my fancy.  (if I even had a fancy)   My date and I relived some moments of our past and played a challenging game of pool, similar to when we first met. We had some drinks, and played reindeer games, and chatted and joked. No doubt it was a great time. I guess atmosphere has become even more important for me lately, even if the beer selection is wide ranging and the prices are excellent. This place definitely screams \" I make great pizza, I swear!\" It seems like you could potential get a good pizza pie here, even if it looks as if Vale Colorado vomited inside this place.  Colorado is not known for it's pizza, so I am not sure if I can trust it.   Overall Boulders gets a 3 because of the beer selection, that aside it is a low 2 rating."}
{"text":"Boulders is what every low-key bar should aim to be. They have an AMAZING beer selection. The beer list changes often to reflect the season, and always includes local beers in addition to the typical staples. The happy hour deals are great (and their bar food is ACTUALLY good). But what I LOVE about Boulders is the trivia! Saturday night, the place is a madhouse, but if you get there early, it's a blast!"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. This place is alright. For a beer bar, the selection could be a little bit bigger. The food was par at best (we got the hot wings and nachos). For some reason the place had a weird stench when we were in there...idk if it was the bar or a customer. It's not in the best part of town either which definitely takes away from the appeal.  Overall, okay, not great."}
{"text":"Very good food, some great beers.  I'll toss up a 5 star as soon as they start supplying real Irish whiskey (Green Spot please ;)"}
{"text":"Boulders on Broadway is the best establishment in all of Tempe. The sweet potato tots are heavenly and they have every beer you could ever dream of. I love you, Boulders."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent, considering it's a bar. Their wings are probably the best I've had.  While the servers are always pleasant, the service time is very hit or miss. I recommend sitting near the bar, to get the quickest service possible.  The seating is a little crowded here, especially on busy trivia nights. I can't be upset that the place is doing good business though.  My biggest gripe, is specifically in regards to my last visit. Without getting too specific, a drunk guy sitting behind me started shouting and swearing at me. When he saw it didn't phase me, he started with the threats. I kept my cool the whole time, thinking the staff at the bar, would take care of the guy who had too much to drink. I was wrong. They didn't kick him out, they even continued serving him alcohol. It was absolutely mind boggling to me that several bartenders witnessed the whole event, as well as all the customers in the vicinity, and yet none of them addressed the issue at all. I don't know if it's because of a lack of training on how to deal with such a situation, or if it was just a lack of caring. Either way, it left a real sour impression."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, friendly servers, and the food keeps getting better and better (fancy burgers, freshly made chips, sirloin tacos, yes!). Half off bottles Thursdays and half off pizzas Mondays make this place a great regular hangout. Go here when you want to hang out with friends for a chunk of evening somewhere you can actually hear each other."}
{"text":"Here right now, worst service ever, 30 minutes for beer!!! Big party and one waitress, poorly managed!!! Do not recommend this place, service so bad can't give critique on food because we about to leave the service is so bad!!! Do not waste your night here!!!! Never got my order, ate scraps from the rest of the party!!!! Done ever waste your time!!!!"}
{"text":"Only visited out on the patio with my dog and some friends. Great beer selection and have a lot of food options on their menu. Asked our server to help me and a friend pick a pizza and recommended the BBQ. It was good."}
{"text":"Great pizza, had the bad day and amazing local beers. If in town a must visit.   Service was top notch and the environment is cool and fresh."}
{"text":"Great food & awesome service!  I live in Southern California, whenever I visit Phx I always make sure to get to Tempe & enjoy the California Carver Burger or the Grilled Pesto Chicken sandwich,  my favorites! The staff is courteous & friendly, good beverage selection and food that never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Call it nostalgia or whatever you will but I have always loved Boulder's. It is the perfect college bar for students who care about how their beer tastes. Boulders really cares about their beer, and it shows. Not only are they constantly changing what's on tap (though not as unique these days, they've been doing it longer than most), but they keep track of their updated list through their own smartphone app. Its a simple app, but I thought it was a nice, extra step toward creating a positive experience.  Boulders has both good bar food and a very reasonable happy hour. If I still lived nearby this would be my ideal place to drop in for happy hour, try a few new beers, and get something to munch on. Though its been awhile since I've ordered a real meal here, I remember them being very good, especially the pizza/calzones.   This bar also doubles as a restaurant. The bar is separate enough from the restaurant seating area that I think you could reasonably take a family here without cause for concern. They also have a decent patio if you prefer to sit outside.  I highly recommend Boulder's to anyone who enjoys reasonably priced and constantly rotating craft beers."}
{"text":"Cool bar, bike friendly, good draught selection!  Told the bartender I drink everything and that he should pick me a good beer, the result was a great suggestion that I enjoyed thoroughly.  This building's layout is kinda odd with a loft and a couple side rooms set up with dining tables.  This results in a cool ambiance and a take-me-back-to-the-golden-years attitude.  Love it."}
{"text":"World of Beer may challenge the title of best taps in tempe, but Boulders is a great place.  Unique selection, good food and service."}
{"text":"I don't remember this place at all! I think I was completely hammered after a pub crawl bike ride from Shade Tree bike shop. It was a thing called \"I suck at poker\" where you smoke a bunch of weed and slam a few beers before heading out into the city on your bike. Ill-prepared to find my way or even care, we headed out on a purposeless pursuit of an untamed ornithoid. Crashing one or maybe twice, I found myself parking my two wheeled man motor in the bar and quenched my drunken mind with what I can only guess was a fine cold pint of drought IPA... Do that and buy something to eat while you're there!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, Chicago style (but not too thick). Very flavorful with a perfect crust. Rotating crafy beer list some local others from all around but no commercial not I saw. I had two stout beers Odell's Russian Pirate, too sweet for my taste and Great Divide Yeti which was just what I like, strong and bitter."}
{"text":"Back to the Phoenix area and had to try more good food here.  Had a great pizza (that's what they are known for) 1/2 price on Mondays - yum.  Also a walnut pear salad enough to make three meals for me.  The waitress was charming - from Seattle no less!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for many years but I must say this place is getting kind of grimy as time goes on... It's bordering on dive bar status. The food is decent and the service is always good and everyone is friendly but please for the love of God give this place a deep cleaning because it's getting really gross and grimy... Has staff ever gone into the bathrooms? The restrooms for example! Cracked mirrors, disgusting years and years accumulation of dust and grime in the exhaust fan cover in the ceiling, grossness all around the toilet and the fixtures and just a general obvious sense that there is no cleaning service here and none of the bar staff going to give a shit about cleaning a restroom. The Point is: if your restrooms are that disgusting what does It have to say about your kitchen, about your tap lines, etc."}
{"text":"Their food is average. I do like their Cesar Salads. The have good wings too. Lots of bears on tap and nice outdoors/pub ambiance. This is a nice watering hole to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"New favorite Tempe bar!  I can't believe it has taken me so long to get to Boulders.  Badass beer selection. Badass drink specials!  I love bars that have daily specials. I would say Thursdays at Boulders are the best... 1/2 off almost all bottles of beer!  *But make sure you look at your tab because the bartender forgot to take of the 50% at first*  It is quite packed with a college crowd but falls into the lines of a 'Casey Moores' more than Mill Ave etc.    Have really great Trivia there on Tuesdays! Its a big place with ample seating and cheap drinks but the best part is that you can bring dogs on the outside patio.  I don't know any other bar that allows dogs on their patio! Its fantastic! Yay Boulders!!!!"}
{"text":"Was there last Sunday with a large group.  Apparently they were phoned ahead to let them know that 50 people would be showing up to eat, drink and spend money.  After getting a beer we never saw the waitress again for 30 minutes.  At that point she took food orders for about 1/2 of the folks at my table, missing me and probably 5 others.  She disappeared again, returning 30 minutes later.  About this time I went to the bar to get another beer and the first bartender (and they weren't busy) basically turned his back on me.  The second one did serve me.  Another 30 minutes later, now tired of this, tracked down the waitress, settled my tab and walked out.  Bottom line the servers were overwhelmed.  I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood spot.  Great place to go to enjoy some good food (bar foods), and drinks.  They have a wide selection of beers to choose from and are very knowledgeable about them.  The staff is super friendly and attentive.   My favorite menu item...\"The Big Freaking Nachos\", a delicious twist on nachos.  Made with fried wonton chips, crumbled Italian sausage, pepperoni slices, peppers, and melted cheese.  YUM!  Don't expect anything fancy in terms of ambiance, it's a hipster hang out, very eclectic."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a pint or bottle of beer. Their range and selection is quite impressive and is constantly changing. There are usually craft beer related events going on a couple of times a month that are truly epic. Recently I have been there for a tap takeover and a Beer for Brains event that were top notch.  Thursday night is my favorite...1/2 price bottles of beer. You can really do some damage for not a lot of money on some awesome craft beer. If you live in the area, this is a perfect place to ride your bike to for some brews.  There is some pretty fierce competition for team trivia on Saturday nights, but I secretly think that there are some cheating teams upstairs. No one is checking them. Maybe I'm just bitter for coming in second place, but still."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection with a great eclectic \"bar food\" menu.  The pear quesadilla and the hard day pizza were exquisite!  The bartender, Chris, was one of the most knowledgeable beer enthusiasts I've ever met."}
{"text":"Could be great but is always just lacking, but for many people it must do the job for them because during prime time hours this place is usually annoying overcrowded.   Seats at the bar itself are scarce. Service is inconsistent as some of their staff is happy to be there, while others seem to hate their job & dislike that fact that you're their making them work.   Without question, beer selection is the star of Boulders. The tap selection is wide & consistently rotates with fresh & diverse offerings. The food is mediocre & average for a bar & grill. It's kind of a jack of all trades, master of none approach to the menu with burgers, tacos, pizza, pasta.   Coming here to watch some sports might be seem to be a good idea, but the seat & screen placement creates some challenges for enjoying a sporting event.   Lastly, turn down the lighting in this place. It's awkwardly bright, bars shouldnt have lighting that makes you feel like you're at target or walmart. Pints, friends, & dim lighting make for a fantastic combination."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome for lunch. We ordered a pizza, and a few beers. The have over 20+ on tap.  The press was much better than i thought the beer was great, the service is commendable, the actual restaurant/bar is clean and well maintained as well as the dining area. It shows was pleasant, polite, suggested a really good bet, and want over bearing. Overall i plan to come back here again, and would recommend this place any day."}
{"text":"stupendous beer selection and food was awesome as well and open late. what else do you need to know?  and umm they have hummus( good hummus) so automatic thumbs up in my book.   you will see me  checking in here.   over n out."}
{"text":"We were looking something fun to do on a Tuesday night and found out they do trivia nights on Tuesdays and have 1/2 priced apps. We ordered the bruschetta, guacamole, and a couple of drafts.  Trivia game was well organized and not to hard which was great.  I use a scoring system that is based off a 1-5 scale with a 3 meeting expectations.  I do a category score for the food, staff, and venue.  The total average score is reflected in the yelp review stars  FOOD 3.75 5-Service / Speed  3-Overall Taste  3-Plating / Look 4-Menu Variety  STAFF 3.25 4-Attentiveness 4-Friendliness  5-Menu knowledge   VENUE 3.5  4-Atmosphere 4-Cleanliness 3-Location 3-Feel"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night for trivia with a large group. The service was slightly slow, good atmosphere and pretty laid back. The place is pretty spacious overall with ample parking and outdoor seating as well. The beer list was missing a lot of my favorites so I tried out about 4 beers from their list. I wasn't necessarily impressed by any of them. The food was okay. I would definitely go back for trivia but not because of the food or beer. Good environment though."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars rounded up.   A mood struck me, it was last minute.  I needed to get out to some place new.  So I sent a text to Anna M and we decided to meet in her neck of the woods.  A quick Yelp search put this place at the top of our list.    Parking was packed.  I had to park in the lot next door.  There were several folks on the patio. As we walked in we were greeted by a large indoor bike rack.  Pretty neat! We claimed 2 empty seats at the bar and the server let us know that they had Happy Hour all day during the weekend, the beers with the * were $1 off and sandwiches were $6.  Ohhh nice deal!   As we looked through the menu we also noticed they offer all you can eat 1-topping pizza for $7 on Sundays. We agreed we needed to come back on a Sunday to check this place out.  Once we realized they also do Pub Trivia nights we also agreed we needed to come back for that too.  In fact much of the crowd on this night was here for the Pub Trivia so much so that within an hour after it was over this place emptied by more than half.   The food and service were quality.  We decided to split the honey chicken sandwich with waffle fries.  A little cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle. The chicken breast was grilled and was thick and moist.  The 2 of us with 2 good beers each and sharing a sandwich came out to about $30 including tip."}
{"text":"A little divey, but in a good way. Food is pretty decent and a good selection of beers. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Boulders is great I go to see Chris and Justin, I live in the neighborhood which is great since you can bring your dog to the patio.   The deep dish pizza is top notch and they always have top shelf beers on tap.   Trivia is held on Sundays."}
{"text":"Been going to Boulders nearly every week since moving to Arizona, and unfortunately this place has taken a nose dive lately. Amazing beer selection, great food, but absolutely awful staff. It was my favorite bar in Tempe for quite awhile, but I'll go elsewhere now to not have to deal with the uninterested and often times belligerent staff. Bummer to see what the workers have done to this place, because it wasn't always like this."}
{"text":"I have been many restaurant and never been to this one. The owner and staffs are super friendly. I was having trouble with online order through yelp. It was end up a disaster through it. When we drive to the restaurant and thought the food was ready to pick up apparently it was not even there.  The staff talked to the owner there. The owner put the order in for us right away.  That is the great satisfied customer service. I called build my own burger, it is really good with fries. also, i order the tangy traditional chicken wings. My sister order grill chicken burger and she say really good. I would recommend this place to anyone who's visit Phoenix Arizona."}
{"text":"Fun little place in Tempe with some decent beer selection and tasty food.  I had a blue cheese burger and waffle fries. Delicious.  Service was good when we were here. It's bit divey inside, I think it used to be a Denny's or Sizzler or something.  The crowd appeared to be mostly college and/or hipsters."}
{"text":"I have been to Boulders twice, once a few years ago for trivia night (can't really judge the place, just had a beer) and for a party a couple weeks ago. The definite pro of this place was the service. They were very accommodating to our large party, even gave us our own party room without a reservation or anything. Our waiter for the party had an incredible memory and handled about 30 different orders and bills... pretty impressive. The drinks here were fine, nothing to write home about, but not bad. I got to try a few different food items, the artichoke dip, a couple of the quesadillas, and pepperoni wheel. None of the food was anything I would go back for. The best thing was the hot sauce with the southwest quesadilla. As impressed as I was with the service, I wouldn't rush back here any time soon."}
{"text":"Boulders probably has the most extensive collection of draft micro-brews in the area. They're constantly rotating through only the best beers and always have plenty to offer in the high-hopped varieties, which tend to be my favorites -- from Dogfish IPA to Stone to Bell's Two Hearted Ale.  The service here is also excellent, both at the bar and at the tables. For a college town, the scene is pretty diverse. There are plenty of early twenties hipsters and hipsterettes but I've never felt like I was the only person over 30 here.  The thin crust pizza is also quite excellent. I always order it extra crispy and it's consistently done right. I'm not too sure about the other menu items yet.   If you like a relaxed atmosphere, really good beer, and tasty pizza, give Boulders on Broadway a try!"}
{"text":"Rogue Dead Guy Maibock, Pepperoni Wheels, and Team Trivia. The rest is kinda irrelevant.  The beer list is absurdly good, the food is cheap and delicious, and the music is kept at levels that are pleasing to the senses while staying conversation friendly.  I expected Boulders to be a college bar but there were plenty of Oldy Olsens like myself hanging out and enjoying the fine spirits and Team Trivia. The wide range of affable, good-looking peeps was really a nice surprise.  The only criticism I can offer up here is the state of the men's bathroom, which was a disaster area. Really, really, gross. But I'm a dude, so whatever.  Boulders isn't in my 'hood but it's definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Shockingly bad food and service. We were with a private paryt upstairs so maybe that was the reason for agonizingly slow service but there's zero chance of me returning."}
{"text":"Great craft beer selection!  The staff is very knowledgeable staff on the beer selections and always friendly. Food.. not so good.  Typical soso bar food. Atmosphere ok but pretty tired and dated. Overall a relaxed bar with great beer and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This place is always so dang good. Such great specials, delicious food and awesome beer!! Here quite often and it always impresses me. The music doesn't really fit but that's okay, the food, people and beer.. Make up for it! Get on down here and get the moose drool burger and spicy hot pickles! Yum"}
{"text":"I had the southwest turkey sandwich which had Turkey, sweet roasted red peppers, southwest sauce and pepper jack cheese. Topped with mixed greens and avocado....it was soooooooo good.  I couldn't eat all of it...very filling.  The waffle fries were really good, well seasoned.  Next time I will have to have a beer!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service, and an excellent laid back atmosphere. It's a perfect place to get a drink or share a meal whether it be for a night cap or a random Wednesday night outing. You can just go in, seat yourself, and ask the friendly server their beer recommendations."}
{"text":"If you love amazing music, come out to Boulders On Broadway.  They love their music so loud, they'll crank the speakers to ELEVEN!  Why I loved Boulders On Broadway before Upstairs Comedy: -Delicious hamburgers -Plenty of different beers on tap -A fine selection of games -Cool atmosphere -Friendly bartenders  You can finish reading if you don't care to read about how Boulders missed out on a big opportunity to be a great place for stand-up comedy.  When I was here back in May, this was a cool place to hang out with friends.  We played Jenga, drank, ate food, drank, watched sports, drank, and did some more drinking.  I had a good time.  Later that month, I started doing stand-up comedy on May 28th.  Two months later, comedy consumed me.  I caught the comedy bug and I wanted to get better, but there weren't enough true open-mic nights to work out new material where you can just go sign up and get on stage.  When I first heard Boulders was going to let us riff upstairs, I thought it was a dream come true.  To perform at Boulders, you didn't have to book yourself to get on the show, nor did you have to sacrifice your time to be one of the first ten people to show up or you didn't get to do comedy.  It was an open mic at its purest form.  And it was worth the thirty minute drive to get there too.  When we first started this, we were welcomed with arms wide opened.  The staff were very nice to us for providing waters for everyone and were very accommodating.  There are a few degenerates in our social circle, but that goes with any group of people.  That's no reason to treat us with less hospitality...like blaring music to accommodate only three people hanging out downstairs on a Sunday night, when there are more people trying to get better at comedy upstairs.  By drowning us out with your music and making our show less enjoyable, the show in general drew fewer audience members.  It was progressively getting less and less of a credible open mic night and more of a colossal waste of time.    I understand you don't like it when broke comedians are thrifty in withhold from spending money on your food and beverages, but most of us were at least trying to scrape out our piggy bank savings for food and alcohol to keep you fire-breathing dragons happy for us giving back to Boulders.  But that just wasn't enough to keep you from playing music on full-blast with your passive aggression towards our craft.  This is like writing a letter to an unrequited love and it is bringing tears to my eyes writing this.  We really wanted this to work, but this was a failed experiment on both ends.  I hope one day we can do a comedy show here again for old times sake, and I hope I can forget about this so I can return to the good old days at Boulders.  Thank you for the good times and I can't recommend this place enough to music lovers."}
{"text":"I saw all of the great reviews and decided to stop in.  Nice laid back spot. Happy hour is 3-7. I arrived at 6:50 and had my food and drinks by 7. The beer selection is awesome! I had the Great Divide: Hercules Double IPA and the Belching Beaver: Phantom Bride IPA. I also ordered the fried zucchini and Mexican nachos. The nachos were good but the zucchini was great! Definitely recommend trying them. The jukebox played a variety of music. There's TVs everywhere with sports on. Service is wonderful. They also have random specials everyday of the week.   Overall, great atmosphere, good food, and great service. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a standard bar to hang out with friends, you will find what you are looking for here.  Food is regular (I ate their pizza and wings), decor is blah - some areas definitely need to be updated.  In general, nothing about this place stands out to me as great or somewhere that I'd want to revisit.  But again, if you are looking for a bar to hang with friends you could do worse than here...."}
{"text":"This is now my go to spot. Service is out of this world! Every sever remembers your name and has no problem explaining anything on the menu. The food is also top notch. I loved everything I have tried! The beer on tap is always changing and they have something for every palate! I will definitely be returning often"}
{"text":"Came here late one night after an event in Phoenix, to have a few drinks and snacks.  The nachos on the won ton chips are delightful and very different then anything I've ever had.  I absolutely loved them!"}
{"text":"$20 minimum on delivery. Way too high when considering other delivery options in the area. (In a college town. lol)"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. I seriously have never had better bar food (completely sober). The service was awesome, our waiter made me laugh every time he stopped by; he wasn't limited to jokes but branched into sarcasm and story telling and I was almost in tears at a couple points. The food was excellent. I got a calzone and shared nachos with my wife, and they absolutely nailed it. Overall this place is arguably one of my favorite restaurants ever, and I will recommend to everyone, always."}
{"text":"A ski-lodgey pizzeria. This says it all. Well, almost. While the decor may be a bit \"weird\" and \"puzzling,\" make no bones about it, the beer selection is great.  Let's re-cap 2 of my experiences, shall we?  DINNER:  Arrived shortly after 6 p.m. on a Saturday and sat in the bar area, which was littered with a few patrons. Live music started at 7 p.m. Since Saturday is considered \"All Day Happy Hour,\" I went with a $5 sandwich - turkey, with smoked provolone. On the side, fresh fruit. They call this their \"Half and Half.\" The sandwich was okay. Nothing I can't make at my own hacienda, though. I really liked the turkey, which like appeared freshly carved. The beverage: Sam Adams Summer ale, which was their seasonal at the time.   My family, who dined with me, thought the food was okay. When both my brother and my dad ordered beef, they weren't asked what temperature they wanted it cooked at. They were just given it well done. I would not have stood for that.   Overall, the food is average \"bar style\" food. The menu is large, though. It may take you several minutes to narrow down your choices. From calzones and burgers to sammies, you have options.   JUST DRINKS:  Now we're talking. If you're looking for a low-key place to hang for a couple hours, play some pool, watch some sports or hear live music, I would suggest checking out this place. They have two pools tables: one downstairs in the bar area; one upstairs. They also have a video game machine at the bar. (Beware that the pool tables were probably bequeathed to this place. After all, balls disappear. Where did the que ball go? Hmm.)  As for the beer, well... Let's just say they have quite the selection. You may not find your fancy imports here, but you will find some really great beers from some Oregon and Colorado microbrews. For that, this place goes up in rating for me (hence the 4 stars). After all, there's not may low-key places 'round town - especially close to home - that offer quite the array of beers to satiate my discerning tastes. I recommend you try The Great Divide Raspberry Ale, which is made with real raspberries. It's not overly sweet, but it's unique enough that you may find yourself, like me, craving it from time to time. Or, if you enjoy Rogue beer, they do sell the Dead Guy Ale on tap!   Sure, I list out their beers here, but that'll take up my entire character limit. Let's just say that on their drink menu, THREE WHOLE PAGES are devoted to beer - what you'll find both on tap and by the bottle.   SO WHY GO?  Uhm, that's easy. Go for the great beer. (That's the main reason for the 4-star rating.)  If you love good beer, like I do, and want to chill with some friends, while playing pool or listening to some live jams (though the live music stopped at 9 when i went), then check out Boulders on Broadway. You may even find yourself thinking you stumbled through an invisible portal into a 1970's Denver ski lodge. Good times!"}
{"text":"Remember McDowell's in the movie \"Coming to America\" with Eddie Murphy?  They had the same menu and practices, but it was McDowell's and not McDonald's.  Same here.  This Old Chicago was converted to Boulders on Broadway, but the menu is virtually a clone menu of the Old C menu with the same options, nearly idenitcal prices, and on some occasions I swear it's the same images.  Tap selections good though, and the craft beer enthusiast will be happy here.  It's always great to see Dogfish Head on tap (90 minute).  It has a dive feel to it inside, as it is often rather dark and gloomy in feel.  Seems to have a few regular alcoholics too, but what local bar doesn't?"}
{"text":"First time here and beer selection was good. Had the pizza rolls and have to say those were pretty tasty, nachos on the other hand were a bit dry and asked for pico to be on the side and they added it anyways . All in all I have it 4 and will be back"}
{"text":"We have been here many times but this was the first time for Sunday football breakfast. We lucked out with the best bar staff ever - friendly and helpful when we couldn't decide. Great selection of beer on tap and the rotating selections are phenomenal. Bloody Mary was a bit on the spicy side - but most people loved it. Breakfast was good - the sweet potato tots were crispy crunchy delicious, bacon was well... bacon. Egg dishes were cooked to perfection. Aside from the rude Bears fan near us, it was a great morning at Boulders on Broadway. Love the bike rack too!"}
{"text":"2 stars since we've had better experiences here, but this was crazy. Our waiter smelled like booze and messed up again and again and again: forgetting our drink order, bringing the wrong drinks TWICE, forgetting one drink altogether (our daughter I s too young to speak up so we didn't realize it till after we left), etc. The cheeseburger arrived without cheese on it, one order was delivered with stuff missing, and another person's order never got put in at all. (Waiter blamed the kitchen and claimed it got burned but we didn't buy it.) We did get comped the forgotten order, which finally arrived maybe half an hour later. Every single person of the five at our table had our orders messed up in some way at least once.   We've had mediocre service there a few times before, but this was too much. Food was ok and the manager is cool, but the waiter was obviously wasted."}
{"text":"My husband and I didn't get a chance to eat before we went to a play in Mesa. Nothing was open for food in downtown so I checked on Yelp for someplace still serving food. This place came up on the list and we were close so went to give it a try. The servers and bartenders were very friendly. They had a nice menu with lots of options. We decided to just go for the hamburgers.  They were really good and we chose their homemade potato chips which were also good. The server said three pizza is very good so I would like to go back and try it. It is nice to know there are places like this for late dining and I would recommend it. Luckily, we missed the football crowd from the Arizona game tonight or we wouldn't have been able to get in."}
{"text":"This review is specifically about their food tent at the Tour de Fat. I bought a whole pepperoni pizza from Boulders on Broadway. It was extremely blah. The standard thickness crust had the flavor interest of Wonder Bread. The sause was barely noticeable. The only thing to add any flavor was the few pepperoni on each slice. I love pizza, however, this flavorless pizza barely meets the definition. I will never order this item again."}
{"text":"I didn't even make it inside... that is just how wonderful the patio is. I grabbed a table near several groups of really friendly locals, artists, musicians, students, all who gathered for great burgers and even greater brews. The beer menu changes often so they even have an app for your phone that updates what's on tap here. The burger I ordered and salad my friend had were both fantastic and the ambiance outside is great if you like the local, artsy feel with friendly staff and customers."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's comfortable, the food is consistently great & the beer selection is always tasty. Jason & Matt are both awesome guys, too!"}
{"text":"I had heard about this spot from various people yet I had never tried it. They have awesome happy hour deals. Weekly from 3-7pm & then a reverse happy hour special from 9-Close! They have a wide variety of foods to choose from. From appetizers such as jalapeno tots, italian nachos, to lunch, dinner & salads. The service was great! The waitress was extremely helpful & nice & even let me sample the Honey Ace Cider! It was delicious. I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a chill spot. They even have outdoor covered patio seating & a fireplace outside for cold nights!"}
