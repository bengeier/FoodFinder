{"text":"Best Fucken Tacos in Scottsdale!! I used to eat here 4 days a week when I lived in Scottsdale. I live in Texas now and I can find anything comparable!"}
{"text":"Love this place to get my late burrito fix. I especially love it after a night out. The place is awesome. Yes, it's greasy but it's yummy. I know, bad, but like I said, yummy. The portion sizes at this place are huge and their food is pretty cheap. I like getting my carne asada burritos as well as a California burrito. I also really enjoy their carnitas burrito, thanks to my friend Jason, and I do like their chorizo burrito when I get in the mood for a breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst fast food place we have ever been to! Terrible customer service! Terrible prices! Terrible everything. I over heard one of the cooks say something about a cucaracha...now, I can't understand most Spanish but I do know what that word means. For anyone who doesn't, it means cockroach! I immediately lost my appetite! They made my boyfriends food wrong and because of his allergy he requested that they remake it. They put up a huge stink and because the cooks refused, the cashier ended up having to go back there and make it himself. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Good stuff. Very authentic Mexican with consistent greatness. Love their Chimi's."}
{"text":"I basically go back and fourth between the carnitas and carne asada burritos.  Add a horchata and I'm in heaven for $7."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Carne Asada burrito's available from any of the drive thru Mexican fast food chains in the valley.  They're huge, meat is super tasty and usually cooked perfectly, and the guacamole inside is fabulous.  They also have amazing hot sauce, both green and red, but I'd sample before dumping on your burrito as it can be quite spicy sometimes, and I like it hot!"}
{"text":"Been going here for 8 years now, breakfast burritos are the best I've ever had and I've been all over the US. You know it's a good hole in the wall place when you see Mercedes and whatnot rolling through the drive through. Burritos are huge and only 5 bucks. Go here."}
{"text":"Decent gut-bomb mexican food. If you want to stuff your face with salty, greasy goodness, this will do. However, I still miss the taquerias my hometown offers (suburb of Seattle with a BIG Mexican presence- no joke). 

I ordered a fajitas burrito, and while it had all the requisite ingredients and a heaping portion of meat (a surefire way to make me happy), there just wasn't the level of flavor and spice I look for. Maybe they thought my pale skin means I like my food bland? The hot sauce they provided was watery and lacked punch as other reviewers note, and didn't kick the bland burrito up a notch like I hoped it would.

I don't see myself returning to Losbetos unless it's a 2AM emergency, anything tastes good when you're desperate!"}
{"text":"This location has never screwed up my order, yet they've been quick about getting my food to me. I'm a picky eater and Los Betos has competent staff. What a contrast from most fast food restaurants! Plus the food has always been delicious and inexpensive. I LUV Los Betos!!!"}
{"text":"For cheap, yet delicious Mexican food, especially after a night of drinking... this is the place.  They're open 24 hours!

Order the Steak Egg and Cheese Burrito.  $5.45, and its about the size of a subway foot-long.  Packed with steak and cheese... oh man, I think I might go get one for breakfast!  *drool*"}
{"text":"Cheap delicious Mexican food. At lunch, the place is filled with Spanish-speaking workers so you know it's authentic and good. Love their flour tortillas!"}
{"text":"California burrito is amazing. Potatoes and onions are finely chopped and sauteed to perfection."}
{"text":"20 years in the area and I frequent Los Betos at least once a month.  Early (college days) consisted of the rolled tacos with guac...hard to beat for the price and the late night run.  While my experience with the broader menu is limited the chicken burritio (just chicken) is my go to item; it's a meal or two on it's own.  Additionally I often order the chicken tacos or pollo asada burrito, the asada burrito is grilled with lots of other ingredients so it takes a little while to make, expect a 5+ minute prep time but be aware that it often has a very high sodium content, wish they would not add salt.  The bean burrito is good but as with the last menu item comment  I'm sort of salt adverse and it too often has too much salt.  I'm not a breakfast person but have after a long night tried the eggs with machaca and while I'm no expert I dont think that was true machaca, more like the shredded beef but it hit the spot and was enough food for two or more."}
{"text":"If you don't speak Spanish be prepared to be insulted to your face with a smile by the drive thru teller en espa?ol. Guess he assumed I wouldn't understand."}
{"text":"We were excited to find this 24-hour place because there are not a ton of options in our neighborhood. I had a burrito and thought it was really good- they were generous with the avocado. Great place to go after Whiskey River."}
{"text":"I've had this place two times and so far so good. It's kind of a hidden little gem but I have been very pleasantly surprised. I usually go to filbertos but after finding this place I'll go here from now on. The carne Asada fries are amazinggggg!"}
{"text":"Long story short I have eaten here twice a day for close to a week and have not died. If I could have a I.V. of their horchata going straight into me I would. They my best friends, my only friends.."}
{"text":"I so love the egg, ham, and cheese burritos and they're served all day!"}
{"text":"This is one of our guilty pleasures...love this place.  Like it much better than all the ****bertos places.   Always friendly and good grub.  Make sure you get extra hot sauce and green sauce.  Carne Burro, rolled tacos w/guac n cheese,  love it."}
{"text":"I ordered a pint of rice and a pint of beans. It took her 3 times before she got it right. She charged me $2 extra for the cheese in the beans even tho that normally comes with it for free. Foolishly, I did not check my food until I got home and realized - Instead of a pint of rice I got a box of nasty orange and brown french fries. Instead of a pint of beans I received half of half a pint. She told me the total was $5.89 and refused to read back the order to make sure it was right. I gave her $6 and she said I still owed her $0.89 and I had to explain it to her. I was in the drive trough for 28 minutes and STILL didnt get the food I ordered or paid for. The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because the beans tasted good. Overall, this terrible experience means I will not be going back even though theyre less than 2 miles from where I live."}
{"text":"Recently ordered some tacos and the meat was NO DOUBT ABOUT IT horse meat!!!!! It was very very dark and not chewable or digestible... Beware."}
{"text":"has vegan and vegetarian options, the beans have lard in them so avoid those but the rice doesn't!! very yummy and open 24 hours!!! i'm vegan and i got the vegetarian burrito with no cheese, no sour cream no beans and add potato's!!"}
{"text":"My first time here, My wife and I decided to swing on in and try the food late one night around 12. I had the carne Asada burrito and she had the steak fajita burrito. Both were super bomb and neither burrito dripped grease everywhere which is a definite plus over filibertos."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy but we really like the food here. Prices are reasonable too. Highly recommend them for take-out or a quick meal."}
{"text":"Best everything!  Best nachos!  Best everything!  Delicious."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd visit a place such as this without a brain full of alcohol, but  recently I discovered the steak and egg burrito here.  I put this little guy on my late night rotation (minus the cheese) and I wake up feeling ready to tackle the day (as opposed to the toilet).  It probably won't win any awards but it more than adequately serves its purpose. Cheap. Delicious. Man-food."}
{"text":"Yuck.... reheated food! So disgusting!!! This place use to be good not anymore.... never going back..."}
{"text":"Great food! Great prices! By far the best breakfast burritos in the area. The only reason I give it 4 stars is they only take cash."}
{"text":"So yummy! The carne asada nachos are the bomb. They are so good we can never make it all the way home without breaking into them. Great prices. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"The tacos were greasy! It's like they gave us the last meat from the oily pan. Ew! And to top it of the tacos were pricey! Should've gone to backyard tacos instead. Don't do it! Drive a little more down the road!"}
{"text":"Typical authentic mexican for these parts. However, if your into the whole fish burrito scene, I suggest you look elsewhere. Not to worry, the shrimp burrito is among the best finds in the valley. The horchata here has the perfect balance of sweetness and spices."}
{"text":"Went there last night late for a chile relleno burrito. I craved one and I haven't had theirs yet. It was delicious and had refried beans. I could taste the relleno batter which mixed with the other ingredients well, but there should've been more relleno. Overall great tasting but too much bean. Nice heavy burrito.
INSIDE SKINNY: Pay the extra buck for a double handful of watery red salsa shots. Sign on drive-through window. A whole shot at the right time makes a magic mouthful."}
{"text":"i love the food they serve at lose betos it's yummy in my tummy, especially los betos whorechata and los betos churros. i  rogelio serna recommend this restaurant to anyone who has a hangover or just hungry."}
{"text":"This is my favorite mexican fast food place in the Old Town, South Scottsdale area, great flavor, good portion sizes. If you want something to finish off a night of partying in Old Town, this place will be open late for you!"}
{"text":"After frequenting Filibertos and often being disappointed, I decided to try the guys across the street.  It was immediately apparent the quality difference by just the tortilla on the breakfast burritos I ordered for my friends and myself.   I have also tried their Carne asada burrito and was very pleased as well.  I haven't tried anything else so I can't comment on other reviews of other foods but this place is hands above the guys across the street"}
{"text":"Los Betos is standard Phoenix Mexican fast food.  It's no different than any of the joints ending in \"berto's\".

The tacos were good with ample portions of beef stuffed into them.  I didn't care for the Jamaica drink.  It had more of a natural taste as opposed to the more sugary versions I am used to.  That may be a plus for some.

This joint is not in my neck of the woods and I just happened to be driving by.  I wouldn't go out of my way to return but if I find myself in the area with a taste for Mexican I wouldn't hesitate to stop by."}
{"text":"My friend turned me on to this place, and so far I have really enjoyed eating here. Great food at a  reasonable price, and it will fill you up !"}
{"text":"As soon as I land in Phoenix, I go straight to Los Betos.  Having lived there for about a year, it was a staple.  Now that I am gone to the East Coast, I can only DREAM about their delicious breakfast burritos.  

I have read the other reviews, and all I can say that anyone who complains just doesn't appreciate the gem they have there.  Is it a pantheon of hygiene, no...but it is a drive through Mexican restaurant that is open 24 hours a day - if you want high class and floors that you can eat off - there are plenty five star restaurants in Scottsdale.  Also, as one with food allergies and a penchant for getting food poisoning - I have never, in ten years, gotten sick once from Los Betos.

Be warned - one burrito is like a pillow, and the red hot sauce is divine and will knock your socks off with spice.   It is a lot of food - but it is worth the calories and the salsa stains.  The staff are also always pleasant.

In all - my only complaint is that it is so far away from where I live now!

The address of the one I love is on the way to the airport or near Fashion Square - at

{"text":"When I lived in Scottsdale, I used to hit up Los Betos about 3-4 times a month.  I always ordered a Carne Asada Quesadilla, with sour cream. After a while, they got used to me ordering it, and would wave to me through the drive thru window. Apparently, I was the only one who ordered this.

Anyways, I got to know the staff, even though I couldn't really communicate with them but through broken English and gestures.  Friendly crew.  Plus, they alway accomodated me with extra hot sauce containers, and I always threw them an extra few bucks.

That quesadilla is heaven on earth.  Someone else posted about 'being in love,' and I can relate.  I seriously cannot go more than a month without one, as I live in Chandler now.  But I make it to Scottsdale once in a while, and every time I do, EVERY time, I stop at Los Betos.  

You put a spell on me."}
{"text":"Food is so yummy and always a fun late night snack when everything is closed. But as soon as we pulled up tonight to the drive thru window a cockroach was in the window and the girl working unfortunately didn't see it until we said something. I'm so sad this happened because now I won't be able to eat there again"}
{"text":"Great food, grest prices, big portions. It's a drive thru but better than a lot if sit down Mexican restuarants. Food came fast & was hot. Service was friendly. Did not experience any of the complaints some had. Food was not greasy, shredded beef in my taco was good. Everything tasted fresh. We had chorizo torta, beef burritio, chili rellenos burrito, rolled beef tacos (they're  crispy) with guacamole & a vanilla churro which was delicious! Look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Best chicken enchiladas ANYWHERE! And only $5 (+tax) for two big servings. I could practically eat these everyday. The chicken is so moist, tender, yummy! Highly recommend this fast drive-thru! :)"}
{"text":"The perks of this hole in the wall taco shop include the fact that it's got the typical rundown look of legit taco shops in SoCal. You know, the kind of nondescript building that indicates a shop thats not about the ambience but the quick, hearty and greasy food. The drive through and 24 hour operation add the ultimate perk of convenience. As for the food, it definitely does it's job as quick, hearty and ridiculously greasy. We tried the California burrito and carne aside fries - staples of a SoCal native - and they were simply decent....doing the job but not quite hitting the spot, you know? We figured that we may have to try other items to see if their specialty lies elsewhere but I can assure you that when we do it will be because the place is conveniently located and readily available at one in the morning."}
{"text":"Not too bad for what it is. I usually get three rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole, or a bean and cheese burrito. The service is quick and friendly, but I'm not too keen on the quality of food but its great for late night munchies. 

Try plain churro :) yum!"}
{"text":"Carne asada burrito with beans and cheese. Dank."}
{"text":"I like this place...I come here at like, 0300 and get tacos or nachos. I'm a night owl so I love me a place that's open 24/7. The food is pretty typical of our local 24 hour Mexican drive thrus. The menu is pretty extensive. Breakfast is available 0600-1100. Generous portions and not so greasy that it hurts your gut later. My go-to middle of the night spot!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend  come here all the time just to get   chilaquiles. So far this place makes the best chilaquiles!  Its very cheap only cost $5.50. This place has one of the best employees by the name of Alejandra also known as Alex. Everytime we come here she is always quick with our meals, she is very kind and communicates great with customers, when I go through the drive thru at restaurants  workers  are not as kind but Alejandra  is kind. Alejandra always has a professional positive attitude and leaves a good impression. I hope she eventually  gets acknowledged  for her great work effort  as a great  employee. We will continue  to come back she helps brings  business  with her professionalism and deserves  to have a raise in her pay for doing  such a excellent  job."}
{"text":"I love Los Betos.  I love all the 24 hour Mexican food places in Arizona.  It shocks me that these places don't really work in other parts of the country.  

I'm writing about this Los Betos because I live within 3 blocks of them.  God knows their food has probably lead to a healthy hardening of my 24 year old arteries.  I eat here at least once a week, and their food is always pretty amazing.  It's just delicious, greasy Mexican food at its best.

Watch out for the 2AM rush, as that's when the drunks show up en masse.  You will likely have to wait in line, and potentially deal with ridiculous behavior.  This pretty much goes for any of these 24 Mexican joints."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Mexican place when I want authentic Tex-Mex take out. My family loves it and the friends I've brought here do as well. I've eaten from here for years. The staff are nice and are good people. Cost is great and they are also open late which is a plus. Los Betos feels like a secret place I enjoy sharing. If you want to have some really tasty Mexican food, go here!! Gracias"}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for a good breakfast burrito. The bacon breakfast burrito here is pretty top notch. The red sauce could stand to be a bit spicier, but there isn't much to complain about."}
{"text":"Hello,

If I could give less than 1 star I would. 

I've gone here three times and the service was good the first two times then I went there the third time after work (I work till about 4 am). Not only did the person tell me they cannot melt the cheese inside a cheese enchilada he also closed and locked the door on my face when I asked about how long it would be. I, unfortunately, let that part go knowing how late/early it was and after working a 12 hour shift myself I wasn't in the mood to argue. After I went home I was eating and pulled 3 hairs out of my enchiladas. I used to enjoy coming here after work for my late dinner and now I'm going to make sure no one I knows goes there. 

I feel genuinely humiliated for the owners. Good luck. 

Best Regards, 

Lucy Cole"}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced, delicious, fast & friendly drive thru service!  I've only been here twice, but it's so good that during a 3 day span I'm back while visiting an area I've never even been to before! 

1st visit I devoured a Carne Asada Supreme Burrito that was massive on flavor & not lacking in girth neither ;) their salsa was the only thing that was underwhelming.

The next morning I bypassed my complimentary Holliday Inn Express breakfast for some machaca & eggs served with beans & grill warmed tortillas. I was in a rush & since it is drive thru only was eating in my rental car like a savage! By that I mean shoveling food into my agape mouth while taking bites out of the 2 or 3 tortillas that were rolled together instead of making breakfast burritos haha with this dish the salsa was a perfect addition! Maybe it was too liquidy for the burrito, but poured over my machaca, beans & eggs it was AMAZING!! The way the flavors all danced as 1 on my tastebuds was a delightful way to start my day!

I will return if I don't just open a Los Betos myself! Everywhere should have at least one drive thru 24 hour Mexican joint!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero I would...I have lived in SW for 25 years...I live and work in the area and felt the the need for quick tacos for lunch..I am a professional and manage the largest grocery  store in the vicinity. I went for taco tuesday...the chicken taco had zero flavor....I choked it down , the ground beef taco....seriously was served with meat that...I kid you not black meat it is was so old and burnt from being on the grill for hours...absolutely horrible..I am still shocked this was I got and it was not even part of taco tuesday...no doubt the worst meal I have ever encountered..I am in disbelieve....oh and the drive through person had zero personality....Tuesday April 18th noon...never again...old town area and not many patrons...now I know why.. how are they in business?"}
{"text":"Now they are using French fries in the breakfast burritos, but the fries were not good and they were raw in my burrito. I also ordered what was the worst side of pico de  Gallo ever. It contained some nasty pieces of white tomato and wayyy too much cilantro. This was a total mess. Place has gone downhill and needs to be demolished."}
{"text":"Real men and women eat at Los Betos.  You're here to get some hearty Mexican cookin', and you give no fucks about the 80,000 calories you're about to consume.  Diets are for the weak, anyway.  You're not on a diet because your body is already a god damned temple, and you're going to worship it by ordering  a combo #2, two cheese enchiladas deep fried in lard, an iron fistful of rice, and mountain of beans.  Then you're going to wash that shit down with a mother fucking ice-cold beverage.  The prices are more than reasonable.  That means you got enough cash left over to order another combo #2.  And you're a god damn rockstar so do you exactly that.  

The employees know the deal.  They make your food quickly and then they get the hell out of the way. You're hungry and you need to eat NOW.  Drive through is available so you don't even need to get out the car while you gorge on the finest Mexican cuisine $6.99 can buy.

Live la vida loca, mother fuckers.  Eat at Los Betos.  Open 24-7."}
{"text":"They need to give Alejandra a raise. She's the best drive thru worker I've ever come across. She remembered exactly what we liked and wanted on our second visit. She has great memory and amazing people skills. 

I ordered a vegetable burrito and loved it. This is now my go to mexican spot. It tastes like senor taco only with a cheaper price tag. I only paid $5.75 and it was huge! I'm so full now and somehow I still want more of it because it tasted so good. The horchata was good but they put too much ice in it. Next time I come here I'll try to remember to tell them no ice. The green chilaquiles here are amazing."}
{"text":"We love this place for the bacon breakfast burrito such good food and good value! Always fast even with a long line. Sunday morni g treat for us."}
{"text":"Where do I start. This was the worst place I have ever ate at. The salsa tasted like nasty. It tasted like it was watered down with sewer water. I got the California burrito. It was ok need some seasoning for sure. Got no guacamole. The service was ok. Would never come here again."}
{"text":"Any of you who read this who have ever been in love will be able to relate:

There's a first pang of distress, when the knife blade pierces the skin, when you know you are in for some pain.  But the endorphins kick in and you realize that you are in for more than you ever bargained for...

At los betos, after a few (5, 10, 20?) drinks, I had the sad misfortune of ordering a carnitas burrito at 220 in the am.  And what did I receive, but the most delectable delight ever served in the pinche madrugada ( rejoice, all my spanish speaking compañeros, a cuss word or two to titillate you).  The carnitas were cooked to a perfect crispy exterior, while the innards burst forth with a cornucopia of spices and flavors that made my very synapses fire indiscriminately with glee.

But, not to be outdone, heartburn would make its own dastardly play for my overwhelmed nerve endings, tearing me from neck to knave with pain.  Did I stop, even for one excruciating second?  Yes, but only long enough to pour on more green sauce, villainously spicy in a way that no beto, be it fili, rol, or eri, has ever been.  Nay, I succumbed to the sweet agony of picante and used that to goad me forth into the foxhole against the onslaught of acid reflux.

Each bite brought both more pain, acute, dire, and relentless, but also a sweet symphony of flavors that can only mean guacamole and green sauce replete with all the accoutrements.  I fought, and fought back hard, and what I can tell you is this:

No burrito has ever caused me such pain and yet no burrito has ever granted me such pleasure.  Like a sine curve, plunging predictably from zenith to nadir and back again, los betos has given me the pleasure--nay, the honor, of feeling every physical sensation known to sentient vertebrates.

Five glorious, painful, resonating stars.  Five harrowing yet riveting stars.  Five supernovas, five black holes, five big bangs of taste.  The world has never known anything like what I have just experienced.  You too can have what I had... all it takes is intestinal fortitude enough to jump in the car with a beer bong and head straight to thomas and hayden.  Oh, and leave the zantac at home, puss."}
{"text":"Their carne asada fries are AMAZING! nothing like filibertos nasty food. Los betos fish tacos are also very good. I love this place :P 

Don't bother going across the street to filibertos they are rude and their food is disgusting!"}
{"text":"A LOT of food and prices are comparable to Filiberto's across the street.  However, the quality is much better.  Tacos, burritos, super nachos... anything \"al pastor\" is flavorful and definitely worth a try!  The chicken that they use definitely has a kick- just the right amount of heat that will leave your mouth tingling for a bit. Minus one star for their carne asada which I found to be lacking in flavor.  Otherwise, everything is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and horrible cook lol i asked for number 9 with green sauce instead of red first he said no i can't, then he said let me ask,  just for me to get 2 wet tortillas in green sauce cold as fuck with a bunch of cold cheeze but on the upside the beans were hot...smh lol just wow this is deff going on my social media.."}
{"text":"Love Los Betos!!! It is nothing fancy, but after a night of drinking it definitely hits the spot. You don't have to be drunk to eat here, most of the food is good all the time. Personally I stick with their breakfast burritos and have never had an issue with it not being hot or cooked right."}
{"text":"Oh Los Betos!! I love you, but your customer service severely lacked tonight. Hubby & I came to get tacos and they were very subpar from the usual scrumtiousness. My husband brought them back to you and was treated horribly. He says we cannot ever return to your establishment! (I probably will on the DL) but will not go when tonight's crew is working. We had initially went through the drive through and when I gave them my card, they asked for my PIN (been there so many times, this has never happened before)! Ummmm, no, not giving out my PIN. Luckily I had just enough cash. We made it home, the chicken tacos were as usual, but my shredded beef was lacking big-time and what was there was dry, chalky, and inedible. When hubby took them back, they argued with him and said \"that's what you get\". No LB, that is not usually what we get. You just lost customers that visit VERY often. So sad. You've been my favorite place since moving here. :("}
{"text":"My sweet lord, The Betos!  I have had just about every item on the menu (except for maybe the shrimp, I mean I'm not insane) and this place just delivers time and time and time again.  It's my first stop whenever I travel back to Arizona.  The absurdly delicious breakfast burritos, the shredded beef tacos with roughly 78,000 grams of fat per serving, steak supreme nachos which weigh about 3 pounds, cheese enchilidas...this place has it all, and open 24/7 to boot.  The staff is friendly, fast, and helpful, so be a pal and don't be shy about dropping a dollar in the tip jar, these guys earn it."}
{"text":"Great place especially when you are drunk.  You can walk right up to it, and order, and for the most part, they get your order somewhat right... if they mess up, it is probably cause you were drunk."}
{"text":"I used to live right up the street from this restaurant and as a result came here several times.  I don't think that there is any way I'd return though.  I have literally never felt good after eating here - whether it was a hazy, late night encounter and getting sick in the morning, or more of a standard evening dinner and getting sick at night.  Maybe I'm allergic to some sort of special, exclusive ingredient they use..."}
{"text":"This my fix when I want cheap and easy mexican food quick! 

open 24 hours, so if your hungry and leaving the club in Scottsdale its nothing to take a cab down the street and get a burrito from this spot
I have only tried the breakfast burrito and the California both are delicious..

cant go wrong with 24 hr Mexican food especially this spot.."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just got to get yourself your sausage burrito fix... and it can't just be any burrito it has to be los betos! So a friend once told me that in order to judge a good burrito it has to be greasy, messy, and stuffed. Yea, los betos is damn right greasy! Once you're halfway done with your burrito it get's really messy, and I think they really fill up those burritos. I gotta admit that we Phoenicians are spoiled with our many drive-thru mexican fast food places and I'm spoiled knowing the greasy goodness of los betos. This is the place to head to after a night of drinking in old town, or simply craving carnitas with the pico and guac. So, these are my recommendations at los betos - try the carnitas burrito coz it's damn greasy and good, and if you're extra hungry, the carnitas supreme with all the fixins. If you want a breakfast burrito, go for the salchicha (sausage) burrito... the eggs, cheese and sausage is mmmmmmmmmmmmm YUM YUM... and finish it off with some horchata or jamaica... oh heaven."}
{"text":"Okay food. 
Beans are sometimes old with a little crustiness.
75% of the time the people have an attitude taking orders... so they get $0 tip most the time."}
{"text":"Favorite place to stop for a bacon breakfast burrito on my way to work.  It's always the same guy working too, and he reminds me to get sour cream when I forget to order it."}
{"text":"Entertainment for the evening.  After careful consideration can I have a chicken taco on a flour tortilla and a shredded beef with a crispy shell...response no we don't have a chicken taco's on a flour tortilla that would be a burrito...no I'm 100% sure that a chicken taco on a flour tortilla is still a taco...sorry we don't offer those....and we should raise minimum wage to what?????

Follow up, I acquiesced.  Crunchy chicken tacos are ok too and for a discounted price on taco Tuesday a good deal, I'm over it and back in the fan club."}
{"text":"Solid place reminds me of the Mexican food in San Diego! The price is a little up there but can't beat the quality of their food! Plus their horchatha is out of this world!!!!"}
{"text":"Ran through their drive through last Thursday. The employee working the window seemed to speak english perfectly but kept asking me to repeat the order. (it happens so whatever, thought nothing of it despite the fact I only ordered one item).

After the 3rd time, he said \"pull up\". I pulled up to the window and had my card ready but was surprised to see said employee chatting away on his cell phone. He didn't say anything to me, not even my total and because I was dumb enough to have my cc ready in my hand out the window, he yoinked it and promptly charged it and continued chatting away on his cell phone IN FRONT OF ME.

I'm a cell phone whore just as much as the next person but I have the decency to know when and where this is appropriate. THIS WAS NOT THE TIME/PLACE, DUHHH much???

I stared down said employee thinking \"surely, he MUST be getting off the phone to actually, ya know, provide SERVICE?\" He eventually walked into the back out of sight, still never having said ANYTHING, not even \"you want salsa?\".

At least when I go across the street to Filiberto's, they have the decency to 1) give me a bloody freaking total and 2) ask me if I want some fu***** hot sauce. 

I'm not expecting a 5 star level of service (I'm realistic, not stupid) but stuff like this makes me want to shove cell phones up the employee's  noses. 

I won't be back."}
{"text":"NO STARS..... Food is good...people who work there are rude ass holes. Im sitting in the parking lot eating lunch. as you well know the parling lot is empty. i am sitting  under the shade enjoying lunch. like i said food is good. So some ass hole, im assuming the manager there in a red ford F-150  he parked his truck right in front of mine \"blocking me in\"...what a prick...thats how you treat customers. Well not this one again. Mexican food is a dime a dozen in Phoenix , ill be sure to put the word out on this ass hole...."}
{"text":"Really good if your black out drunk! This place is really busy once all the clubs and bars in old town close for the night! The food is decent for a good price and it's quick! Don't expect the best quality but for the price can't complain!"}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are GREAT. I have ordered with bacon or with sausage. The tortillas seem fresh. Once I even ordered a cheese quesadilla and it had a LOT of cheese packed in there the kids loved it.

The only negative is it is greasy and the restaurant is definitely a hole in the wall place. But if you know that going in, you'll like it."}
{"text":"I love this place....and all divey mexican joints for that matter!  I was in the area today, and was unfortuantely still full from lunch, so I didn't stop.  I used to drive by every morning on my way to work and would go through the drive thru at least 2-3 times a week to pick up breakfast AND lunch.  I don't care how dirty their kitchen is....I have never gotten sick, EVER.  When I was on a low-carb diet, I would order a burrito, eat the insides and I was still full!!!  Now, I fully indulge in the greasy, lard-filled, carb-filled goodness.  How can you go wrong with a breakfast combo of scrambled eggs w/ ham, refried beans and fresh tortillas...YUMM!!!  I agree that their \"hot sauce\" is very watery, but it still works.  Carne asada, carnitas, pollo asado, it's all good \")"}
{"text":"Vegan option here. Vegetarian burrito  minus the cheese and sour cream. If you are a real meat lover then prove it by getting the Cabeza tacos  or the langua. Always funny to me how people who eat meet won't try these. They are delicious. 

Breakfast burritos and huevos rancheros are huge as well. 

Always good for a quick fix."}
{"text":"I was in the area, craving a breakfast burrito and yelped for it. Saw a few places hit the radar but this joint was on my path so went for it. I did check a few reviews while on my way and was worried. I believe the other reviews were being a bit critical. The burrito was good, not great, not amazing, but good. The tortilla was REALLY good, a little light on bacon, potato could have used another minute or two of the grill. Cheese and egg were right. The place wasn't \"filthy\" as some have reported. It was old, just old, not dirty. Tables and counters are very worn! It looks like someone started a biz on a low budget and are making due with what they have. I can't get mad at that! I hope they kill it and continue to grow! Check it out, it won't disappoint...plus there are not a lot of other options within a couple miles."}
{"text":"Worst burrito spot ever! If you guys like carne asada burritos or frys go somewhere else! The 2 times I went here were equally terrible. Had a lot of cartilage bites in the meat that I had to spit out, the guac is a flavorless liquid, and the dude is insanely rude. My homie ordered carne asada frys and the guy gave him a burrito, when explaining this isn't what I ordered the man argued with us and persisted on saying it was and that's that. On every angle this place sucks. The filibertos across the street isn't much better but still not as bad. If you're looking for good service and good quality go to either the one off 7th st and bell or cave creek and Beardsley. Shea and 32nd street isn't too bad either. But seriously, this place off 32nd and greenway is terrible, I live nearest to it of all the burrito shops and I'll still drive the extra 3-4miles to avoid suffering the disappointment and dissatisfaction of this terrible place."}
{"text":"Tortilla was delicious.  So was the potatoes in my bean, cheese, potato, guacamole burrito.  The guacamole was fresh with chunks of avocado but a bit spicy for my preferences.  Will try again without the guacamole.

This is drive through or window service only."}
{"text":"I worked close by, gave this place a few trys and  yuk! I ordered the beef burrito it was so full of green bell peppers i asked the cashier if it was the right burrito he said yes. Ordered the rolled taco supreme one time, the tacos were so over fried i couldn't hardly eat it.. i live close by and walk my dog, ive noticed they leave the back door cracked open and it looks pretty gross back there. I only ate there twice and stoppped going. Find a filibertos...."}

{"text":"Please do not ration my hot sauce! When I say I want a lot that does not mean 2 thimbles instead of one. Also please warm up your precooked ingredients before you slap them in a burrito.

I went on a trip here with a Friend after a hike, we were hungry, and his out of town guest wanted to try a \"taco stand\" so after driving around the shadier parts of town for a bit we found this place. 

 I ordered my usual Chile relleno burrito. Here they fill the space around the Chile with rice cheese and sauce. However my Chile it self was cool as if they just pulled it out of the refrigerator. The one surprising thing is that I did not get sick.

My Friends seemed content with their burritos however there was an extreme shortage of hot sauce, we shared it, then we fought for it, it was a truly sad scene."}
{"text":"Green chile means more than one thing, and although I didn't get the New Mexico-esque concoction I hoped for with the green chile burrito, it turns out that the burrito was worth it for the outstanding, juicy pork. Not radically different from carnitas, it reminded me a little of southern pulled pork.

The accompanying green sauce was fine, but a bit like anywhere else. However, the red was a powerful recipe that no spice enthusiast should miss.

There are no indoor seats, just a couple of outdoor spots at this mostly drive-through venue."}
{"text":"I love their sausage breakfast burritos!! But my only complaint is that it includes potato's inside and they sometimes put French fries instead. You can totally tell the difference on the texture and taste. The fries are old and hard and it ruins the whole burrito...So beware. Be specific on what you want in your burrito!"}
{"text":"Let's Order Mexican Ma!
3 fish tacos $5.95 that are craving-satisfying morsels
What's in that sauce? cilantro? special chee-lay? YUMMMM

Honestly I think fish are sticks so it's comfort food that returns me to this smellicious mex-y stand.  My fam is always SAVE ME SOME esp the rice.  Add a Mexican Coca Cola in the bottle AYE

they're 24 hours!

{"text":"I love this place. Everything I have ever had here is yummy! Not once has my order been wrong. Plus the $5 for 5 tacos is great!"}
{"text":"5 stars for a drive through Mexican food joint?? Eff yes.

 Basing this solely on the type of restaurant they are, Los Betos is pretty damn good (and affordable too). Monster burritos, cooked up and delivered in the drive through at record breaking pace along with some killer red salsa.

I love Los Betos for their quick and easy way of getting me a delicious breakfast burrito on the go when all you really want in the morning (or late at night - they're open 24 hours) is a tasty gut bomb that is Mexican fast food."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through for lunch a few weeks back. Had been craving a carne asada burrito. 

It took longer then I expected for a drive through, no big deal.

Tasted pretty good, I was impressed. Always glad to find a quick burrito place for those occasional cravings.

Later that day went to dinner with some friends. Before I ate anything at dinner something in the belly wasn't feeling right. Started feeling bloated and slightly nauseated. Left early and went home.

Arrived home, ran to the bathroom. Didn't leave for 6 hours. Not going to go into detail but I was sick as hell for the next 36 hours. Both ends.

Never again.

Unless you're 8lbs from your ideal weight and don't care how you get there, avoid this place at all costs.

Food poisoning is awful."}
{"text":"Cheap, quick mexican food.  Don't come here if you're looking for high quality.  Look at the prices & the environment & you got what you came in for."}
{"text":"Great deals - Five tacos for $5.00 and lots of meat.  I really like the salsa bar too!"}
{"text":"Los Betos serves up great food.  I like that they serve tacos with a grilled jalapeno and limes on the side.  The carne asada plate is good. The adobada torta is also good."}
{"text":"One evening I had hungry, loud, complaining kids in my car and, out of sheer desperation, I turned into the drive through of this completely 
non-descript \"berto's\" looking kind of restaurant.

WHAT a find!  Outstanding food, fast, cheap.  Happy day, happy kids.  We've been back a few times for pick-up.  No ambience, but that's not what they are about. Expect really good really reliable old school Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican place in all of Arizona. Very authentic and super yummy. The place atmosphere is a little run down and it's kinda hard to understand them in their drive through but the food makes it all worth it. I've never had anything i don't like here!!"}
{"text":"This place really scares me sometimes.  I bit into a taco last night and grease literally streamed out the other end.  Luckily I'm already on Lipitor."}
{"text":"Hands down best Carne Asada nachos I have ever had. Excellent distribution of toppings and the meat is cooked to perfection and deliciously seasoned."}
{"text":"I usually stop at this place once a week after work. The food is really good! I Usually get a  California burrito or super nachos, they are both delicious. I highly recommend this place if you want fast service and good food."}
{"text":"I am giving it five stars for doing what it is meant to do...let you indulge in some inexpensive Mexican food, fill you up and not break the bank.  There are many around town like it, and this one doesn't disappoint.

If you find yourself on Greenway and wonder \"should I go here or to Filiberto's across the street\"?  Go to Los Betos.  Read the competitor's reviews and take them seriously.  The tatted out surly girl who seems to always work there will begrudgingly take your order (she seems to always be annoyed you are making her deal with you and your empty stomach)  and the disappointment continues from the high prices to the terrible food.  But I digress. This review is not about them.

I have a couple of favorites I order and the cashier always remembers me by them.  Service is prompt, always friendly.  The food is generous with the guacamole and cheese.   The only seating is outside which is only good if the weather is nice and there aren't undesirables from the area hanging out. 

Great late night pit stop!"}
{"text":"The bomb nachos!!  I used to think 'nachos are nachos' until I ordered from here.  They are loaded and I ordered mine to go and asked to have the chips separate so it didn't get soggy.  I just expected them to throw it all together and then give me a bag of chips, but they put each ingredient in a separate container to build my nachos at home.  THEY WERE SOOOO GOOD!  Good quality ingredients, not greasy and humongus burritios too.  I highly recommend and I think I'll stop there after work now that I'm talking about it, I want some!  Thank you.

This is a drive thru type place, with an outdoor patio area, not an indoor restaurant, in case you were wondering."}
{"text":"Great service, best prices, much better than Filibertos. Free chips and salsa if you go inside!"}
{"text":"Chorizo burrito. Nobody else comes close to Los Betos. Everything is good with generous portions, and it's consistantly good. But their corizo burrito is the bomb."}
{"text":"Best San Diego style burrito shop this side of the Califoria border."}
{"text":"I live in NW Florida. We don't have this kind of Mexican fast food there. I have missed Los Betos since I worked out here almost 10 years ago!! Had the 5 rolled tacos and they are STILL delicious!! Gonna gorge on their food for the next 3 days that I'm here!!"}
{"text":"This joint was GOOD. 

I don't know about the other reviews saying it was cheap- $20 for a drive through isn't exactly cheap- but good, YES. 

It was quick and m deeee-lish. The food was fresh and yumo. 

Bean and rice come with the combos- the burritos were HUGE."}

While I was waiting for my order, I went to the Salsa Bar to load up.  I saw that they had the typical Green & Red runny, mild Salsa and some Chunky Spicy Salsa...yes!  I like spicy, so I grabbed a few cups and filled them up.  Slight problem though...the cups for the Salsa were the soft, paper like cups typically used for Ketchup & Mustard.  You're probably wondering why that's a problem?  Well, it's because when you fill it up with Salsa, it becomes wet and soft and very difficult to carry in your hand because it spills all over the place....yep, it was very messy.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=g1dj4KmtgcSb0p46KFcaHA#g1dj4KmtgcSb0p46KFcaHA

The food came out a short while later and I started with the Carne Asada Taco....it is a pretty big portion for Street Tacos.  The portion size was the only positive though....the meat was bland....and the Guacamole and Pico de Gallo that was on the Taco didn't help much.

Next was the Carnitas Taco.  This one had slight more flavor and was a little better than the Carne Asada....however, it was average at best.

Last but not least was the Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito.  This was very good.  Some Mexican Joints like these have oily BRC Burritos...but not here.  There was no oil and the ingredients tasted fresh.  The Tortilla was very good as well.

Overall, my experience here was average...3 Stars.  If I do come back, it would be strictly for the BRC Burrito.

Return Factor - 50%"}
{"text":"Convenient and delicious. Slightly higher price than other 'drive-thrus' but the portion size is relative. Even at the drive through I wait a little while, but honestly- it's worth it - which says alot!

I will definitely keep going back."}
{"text":"I'm a Mexican food junkie. Nothing beats a good Carne Asada Burrito or a Bacon, Eggs, n' Cheese Burrito when you got a case of the hangovers. Los Betos is average in satisfying your Mexican food fix.

If you're drunk, stop on by and get your favorite post-drinking Mexican dishes. They have what everyone else has. They won't disappoint. 

When sober, however, you'll notice the inconsistency. The tortillas are sometimes hard and taste days old, the guac is nasty on occasion, the Carne Asada frequently is dry and rough. 

It's okay Mexican food...unless you're schmammered. Then it's the shiz!"}
{"text":"Wowwww!!!!!! Went to Los Betos for the first time today. Ordered a chimichanga- it weighs about 3lbs- no exaggeration! The food is EXCELLENT!!!! Will NOT disappoint!!"}
{"text":"this place is the best + it's open 24 hours -- rolled tacos are dank af"}
{"text":"Seriously the best 3am quesadilla I have ever had.  It was big and gooey, with just enough browning on the outside of the tortilla to make it a little bit crisp.  As an added bonus it was kind of cold outside, so it made a great hand warmer as well.  Why only 3 stars?  OK, you do have to sit on some questionable outside picnic tables and I don't want to think about how clean the kitchen may or may not be, but the entertainment value of watching tipsy people stumble around while waiting for their food can't be beat."}
{"text":"If you're looking for clean, chic Mexican food, don't go to Los Beto's. But, if you want a messy, cheesy brick of goodness late at night to soak up some booze, look no further. 

Los Beto's is my favorite 24 hour Mexican food drive thru around. I have heard murmurings of health violations but only for really minor infractions that you would probably expect at a place like this anyway. Like I said, if you want to sit down in a clean restaurant with light ingredients this isn't for you. 

The Texas Burrito is stuffed with chicken, potatoes and melted cheese. Pour a little salsa on every bite as you go and you're on your way. 

But, don't eat and drive! I have salsa stains on many a pant that can tell you why not."}
{"text":"Dude! There is a Los Betos right across the street from the Whiskey! When you're done oogling the girls on Wednesday night, go there and pick up a burrito. They're under $4 and you're so effed up that you will be thinking it is the best damn unicorn burrito you have ever tasted!

But I actually recommend the bacon, egg, and cheese. They messed mine up last night and added chorizo and it was the BOMB! The horchata is also sweeeeeet!!!

P.S. - Don't expect fast service. Do expect a line."}
{"text":"Been a while since I have been here. It's definitely lost its edge. They Nicole and dime you for everything now. Salsa is an extra $1, sides are overpriced and the menu items have increased in price. Pass next time."}
{"text":"authentic fast food mexican like the ppl don't even understand english that work here and I had to pull around to the window to give my order. i highly recommend the carne asade fries it so huge-like at least 2 meals worth for $10 and so delicious with all the fixings you can think of-worth the 2000 calories."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  It is usually the first place we stop when we get to Scottsdale and the last place we eat at before heading back home.  I spent too much time and money there while a college student, but the food was cheap back then and it is delicious.   I can't find the equivalent out here in the San Francisco Bay Area.  The carne ascada tacos without beans are what always keeps me coming back.  The super nachos are really tasty too!  

Well, shoot!  Now I want that for dinner!"}
{"text":"Transplant from California to Michigan but here visiting family...needed an authentic breakfast burrito and am now feeling so happy. Yum and yum!"}
{"text":"If you're ever on 32st & Greenway, you're most likely in a bind with deciding Filibertos or Los Beto's. I'll tell you right now your best bet is Los Betos! Small family owned restaurant where they make you quality Mexican food! I've tried multiple burritos and plates and they are all delicious! Filbertos is too bland and the food is poorly prepped."}
{"text":"Found chewed up gum in my burrito tried to talk to the manager and he laughed in my face and locked the window. I have never been so grossed out in my life nor treated with so much disrespect. I will never be coming back."}
{"text":"My friend lives nearby and really likes this joint. It is very convenient! We don't have drive-through Mexican food in Hawaii...lol. Anyways, I had combo plate of 3 tacos with rice (no beans for me!) I didn't pay attention to the \"rolled\" before the tacos and was confused as to why I had taquitos. lol. But my husband assured me that they had given me the right thing. 

It was tasty, nonetheless. Their guacamole tasted a little odd to me, and they plopped on a huuuuuge pool of it onto the tacos, so it overwhelmed the plate a little bit."}
{"text":"You want to feel guilty, satisfied and happy come here during the hit of drunken cravings at 2am and its a no fail mmmmmmmm gooooood! The bacon burritos that I've taken in are badges of pride in the form of plaque in my arteries.  Totally have accepted it but its alright.  Clean kitchen from the viewpoints I can observe with speedy service.  That's all I need.  After this review Its gonna be time again for another bacon goodness."}
{"text":"Losbetos is the bomb. So dirt cheap and you get so much food. I live across the street so it's super convenient for me which I love! It's open 24 hours which is the shit. I haven't been there at any really odd hours as of yet, but I like knowing I have the option and I also presume I will end up there at some weird hours at some point. They're carne asada, chicken, and huevos rancheros are all soooo good. You will be in a serious food coma after you eat here."}
{"text":"This was the best breakfast burrito I have ever had. I ordered a bacon potato burrito - packed inside, everything tasted so good, tortilla is fresh, red salsa is a little spicy, but I have dreams about it now.. SO GOOD.  I grew up in Arizona and am so bummed that I didn't find this place until after I moved.  I already can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Good old fashioned authentic Mexican food. The Carne Asade burrito is delicious and the portions are very generous. I always feel full from one burrito."}
{"text":"This place has THE BEST rolled tacos.  They are so delicious it is hard not to inhale them.  In fact I ate them so fast today that I gave myself a stomach ache.  I also really like their breakfast burritos.  The one thing I will say is that we ordered their fish tacos for lunch at work and the fish was so overcooked it was inedible.  BUT they totally took care of it when I called them and let us replace our fish tacos with anything else from the menu in record time.  This shows that they care about their customers.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Really, I should know better...

It was late at night, we didn't feel like fast food burger places, and I have driven past this place millions of times. 

It's in a dark scary lot too close for comfort to Greenway square. Probably not the best place for a woman to go by herself late at night, but luckily I had the husband with me.

After looking at the extensive menu, I ordered the chili relleno plate and my husband ordered a chicken burrito, beef taco, and a horchata. 

I couldn't finish my chili relleno plate. (Quick lesson in Mexican cooking- when preparing anything with chilis, its a good idea to remove the majority of the seeds. Not just because of the heat, but because its NOT fun to have a mouthful of seeds.) Besides the hundreds of chewy seeds in my mouth, the chili rellenos were lukewarm. The whole plate was pretty bland, and with every bite I took I knew my stomach would be paying for it later. So I only ate half, then popped 3 tums and hoped for the best. I ended not having serious food poisoning, but I definitely felt uncomfortable all night.

On the other hand, my husband didn't think his food was too bad. His chicken burrito did  have a couple bones in it. He liked the beef taco. 

I might come back for a breakfast burrito. After all, it is hard to screw up an egg and potato burrito. It seems like this food would taste much better while drunk or hungover."}
{"text":"Braised chicken tacos are the bomb.  I could eat these every day.  Quesadillas are so cheesy too and huge"}
{"text":"Love this place.  I discovered this place when I moved to Scottsdale about 2 years ago, from a far far away city called Tempe.  Since I discovered it, I have gone at least once if not twice a week, every week.  

I love the authentic Mexican food places like this, and in AZ you can find stores like this  spread about everywhere.  This place closely represents Filibertos, but so so much better. The food is always super hot, super fresh and the girl typically running the window is friendly.  

The burritos are stuffed fat, and the super nachos are huge.

They have been gradually upgrading the place, pretty recently they got a brand new menu board and painted the building, so they are putting the work in the appearance.  

Really the only two cons about the places is that the guacamole is not the best, it taste store bought, and is not made fresh, and the prices can get kind of high.  The burritos and nachos, etc are super worth it, because you get a ton of food...I am a 190 pond male that goes after workouts, and sometimes I cannot even finish all of it....but the tacos are 3.25 each, and some other menu items are a little on the high side.  

I really hope they upgrade their guacamole...if they did that, I would change the rating to 5/5. 
 
Everything is so fresh and tasty...the guacamole really ruins the reputation of the rest of the food...its ok, just could be a lot better.

This place is great though, I will continue going here as long as I live in AZ"}
{"text":"This place used to be delish! Now it is absolutely HORIBBLE! Run. Don't go. Chicken tastes like it is either not real or the bottom of the barrel GROSS!
Made us sick the past two times we went. It is sad because they used to be better than most Mexican places."}
{"text":"Take it from AZ native, best machaca burrito and chicken tacos around. Try the flautas with guacamole, drive thru and go sit in the park to enjoy"}
{"text":"It is perverse that I like this place so much. It is in my top 5 \"fast food\" type eateries and I am lucky enough that I get to Scottsdale several times/year on business so I never have to go long enough without that I get the shakes. I'm amazed that they are open 24 hrs a day but I love it because I am usually jet-lagged when here and am looking for breakfast very early. This place never fails to be totally dead at 4 or 5 in the morning but the lit \"Los Betos\" sign in the driveway is always on and pulls me in like a moth. Some of my favorites are the carnitas burrito (the carnitas always has some crispy edges to it full of flavor) that comes loaded with a healthy dollop of excellent guacamole, the carne asada tacos (2 are a meal), and their breakfast chorizo and egg burrito. One of the other things that I love here are their version of chiles toreados which are large chiles (sometimes jalapeño, sometimes serrano) grilled and deep fried, salted and served with lemons. They are hot, salty and full of flavor and they will burn so good today and again tomorrow! The final thing for me that makes this place great is that everything is made hot, huge, fresh and a la minute."}
{"text":"Okay, the Betos isn't going to win any international awards for culinary subtlety but dammit if it isn't an institution.  And, yes, you'll hear the haters talking the mess about the 'Tos being just for late-night drunken gorging.  False.  Slander!  Their chimichanga, paragon of authentic Northern Mexican cuisine, I know -- is otherworldly in its cheesy, meaty assault.  The carne asada burrito -- aka \"the donkey dick\" -- is abusively delicious, as are the breakfast burritos.  AND, as a bonus, I've never gotten ill from eating there in ten or so years of loyal patronage.

And to address to accusations of cats being used to supplement the meats, as my buddy once pointed out, \"If this is what cat tastes like, it's all good.\"

And don't be fooled -- they're not open on Xmas Day.  That's why they get four instead of five stars.  Bullshit."}
{"text":"I love eating at los betos. My favorite is their chicken enchiladas which I get constantly. They fill my tummy up and taste delicious with their lettuce and chicken and red sauce.  When im not in the mood for enchiladas my second favorite item is the green chili burrito which has just enough kick before its overpowering. This place is definitely a hole in the wall but isn't that what makes a dingy little Mexican joint so awesome? The only reason im giving it 4 out of 5 stars is because their food isn't consistent some days their food is really good and other days its just alright."}
{"text":"They always have the most rudest people working at drive. I've been here three times and they are so rude, retrain your employees on how to greet and communicate with your customers. I spoke English and Spanish and it's not a language barrier they just have nasty attitudes."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious when you're intoxicated. A 50-50 chance being decent or totally gross when you're sober. Los Betos offers a lot of greasy food for cheap, but like any 24-hour drive through Mexican stand in the valley, it's a gamble that you will most likely regret when you wake up in the morning. 

I used to live a stone throw From Los Betos and ate here way too many times during that period of my life. Like a majority of the patrons, I drove through after a night at the bars or after a late night of working when traditional fast food just wouldn't do it for me. I also probably had a BAC that was pretty close to the legal limit. The staff was always pretty cool and friendly. For better or for worse, one guy even consistently remembered that my usual order was 3 rolled tacos with guacamole and a quesadilla."}
{"text":"Omar is the best!!!!! My friend and I come here probably more often than we should admit and every time we get the bean and cheese burrito and green salsa. It is by far, waaaaay better than Filbertos or any of the other mexican fast food places in Phoenix. And Omar is so friendly. The place looks kinda sketchy but you should definitely try it out anyways!"}
{"text":"We drove by this place forever and kept saying, hmmm, wonder if it is any good...it is! We love the steak burrito and the Jamaica is sooo good. Haven't had a burrito I haven't liked yet, only wish they had some indoor seating.

Mucho Bueño!"}
{"text":"The tacos are so delicious, huge, and reasonably priced, and I am picky about tacos! The best deal for any food I've seen in a long time. You can tell they take time to chop the vegetables and make the guacamole from scratch. The tortillas were homemade as well. Thankfully I just moved in down the street so I can come often. I had the carnitas taco and adobada taco."}
{"text":"While not as good as Fiesta Burrito, this place is an okay substitute."}

{"text":"Went here for a couple of beef tacos the other night.  The outside looks a little rough - it's pretty small too. 

The tacos were great - they came out fresh and not overly greasy.  I'd come here again for more tacos and maybe venture into some of their burros."}
{"text":"Food is good unless you go late at night. Late at night they leave egg shells in the breakfast burritos and you always feel sick after. But in the morning and afternoon it's great!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Definitely our new favorite spot! No completion in my eyes between here and the Filibertos across the street. Delicious food and really nice service."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in North Phoenix. I love the Breakfast Burritos with sausage and the Carne asada is awesome!"}
{"text":"I lived in San Diego for the last 16 yrs so I love a Taco shop like this place. I got the Carne asada burrito supreme. It had everything you want in a burrito, beans cheese, salsa, rice and sour cream. Many choices on the menu...all of them decent."}
{"text":"Plusses: 1. It's open 24-7, 2. The service is quick and friendly, 3. The portions are generous, filling you up when you're hungry.

Minuses: 1. There's nothing fancy about the food, so you're paying for the portion size and convenience

That's the only minus. It's simple, quick Mexican food. Anything more than a guilty pleasure and you're doing it wrong."}
{"text":"My complaint is not about the food or the majority of the employees at this location. Just one in particular. Looks like they have a new hire at the window. Usually during the night I'm greeted with an awesome lady. No complaints prior about the service. This time a younger male was at the drive thru. He was incredibly rude for no reason. Made us feel stupid for asking a simple question. You should not work in customer service if you are not a positive person. Also..When I asked for green salsa (why are they so stingy with this salsa? Why offer to two salsas if your going to be stingy about it? I'm sorry but if I spend over 20 bucks I want the good stuff.)...he acted pissed off or bothered. He only gave us two salsas also. Sorry but I'd rather have good green sauce then the mild red. As a long time customer it's super annoying to have someone be rude for absolutely no reason. I work in customer service in the food industry, I understand the stress of working the window. I am always tipping this place each time I come. Im not saying I'm entitled to the best service, I'm just stating that in all my years coming here I haven't experienced such bad customer service. Don't know if this kid is new and Doesn't  know what he's doing or if he is just rude. But I will be going to Tacos Jalisco, from now on. Better food anyways."}
{"text":"We ordered two breakfast burritos, one without eggs due to allergy, only to find out when we got home they both had eggs!  Neither was that tasty, and the two salsa options (red & green) were watery, not spicy or flavorful.

Drive-thru only, FYI.  So no salsa bar like others.

Tortilla not great/seems store-bought, unlike the excellent homemade tortilla shells at Regio's Mexican Food at 1705 E Indian School Rd."}
{"text":"AMAZING SERVICE so friendly, very reasonable , and really cares about their customers and their wants this will be my new go to spot for Mexican food . LOVE LOVE LOVE ."}
{"text":"I bought the bacon, egg, cheese and potato burrito and it is scrumptious. Everything inside  the burrito is evenly distributed as they chop everything and fill the burrito. Open 24 hours a day which is the best. They are a bit frugal with their hot sauce. They seem to want to give you enough but it's so good that it's forgiven. By me anyways."}
{"text":"As I put the bag on the counter and removed the pollo asado burrito I couldn't help but smile. As I held this monstrosity up to my size 8 head I noticed my head and the burrito were nearly the same size. Yes, the building may have seen better days, and I'm sure things could be much cleaner on the inside. but Betos is a strong value with huge portions and classic flavors.

If you are concerned about your waistline, this place isn't for you. This single chicken burrito had as much chicken as 2-2.5 burritos from Chipotle! In the future, I may eat 1/2 for lunch and 1/2 as a midnight snack.  As other yelpers have mentioned, yes there is noticeable amounts of grease, lard, and/or trans-fat. Who cares? It's almost refreshing to taste these old school flavors, as you will not find richness like this at the competition.

Because I was unaware of these epic portions, I also ordered a chorizo quesadilla for under 5$. This was also nearly comically huge! The chorizo was authentic, well seasoned, and plentiful. The grease level penetrated the fresh tortillas and created another unique rich flavor. 

What's even more impressive is that I lost track of time studying, and came in for a late dinner around midnight. Everything was perfectly hot and fresh. They even discount there already low prices for tacos on Tuesdays. I don't usually yelp after only a single visit. but this taco stand really punches above its weight."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again. I ordered thru door dash and they ended up forgetting one item so I called Los Betos to let them know and the guy who picked up the phone pretty much called me a liar when I told him what happened. He swore up and down that he did this and that and when I told him I didn't receive my item, he cursed at me and then hung up on me. What poor customer service. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Trash! 3 times I have been there and my enchiladas have been uncooked. Service is good but wow! If I wanted my food uncooked I would just eat the cheese out of the plastic packaging.. I mean wow!"}
{"text":"Considering how fast their service is and it being 24 hours you can't go wrong here. Not too crazy on their chicken but their beef tacos are really tasty. Great for the price and convenience"}
{"text":"Had a terrible couple experiences here after I was charged 3 DIFFERENT TIMES to my debit card for one single meal. After bringing this to the lady's attention who is always there (and doesn't speak much English) - and showed them my bank statement clearly showing the 3 different charges - she didn't believe me and insisted on making me wait 25 minutes while she tried to go through a week's worth of receipts.  I tried to insist she read my bank statement knowing that I wouldn't buy 3 of the exact same meals in 3 different transactions. The lady eventually said to come back and remind the cook instead of refunding my card or giving me a written voucher to compensate me.  She insisted that her and the cook \"were ALWAYS there\" and would remember...

Needless to say, I came back about a month later and they didn't remember at first. Then she clearly recognized me and then started to act like she couldn't speak ANY English all of a sudden!  My friend and I knew that she recognized me and told her, \"¡Sí, entiendes!\" (yes, you understand), then she had the nerve to tell me that, well, it was too long ago! Are you freakin' kidding me?!?  So unprofessional and unethical of them as they couldn't care less about doing the right thing, and compensating a loyal customer who they clearly overcharged.  I will NEVER go back there!! Their food is also waaay too greasy anyways made with cheap, low quality products.  Horrible experience and I urge folks to go to across the street to either Gordita's El Tio or Filliburto's instead."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of this place although I've been eating here for about a decade or so. Over the years, this place has been hit with multiple health code violations - make no mistake. It's an unclean place. Most of their ingredients come from huge cans or vats - they don't really \"make\" anything there as far as I know. It's all shitty crappy food. The shredded beef is dry and tough and looks like charred rat tails. I guess when it's the closest mexican food place still open after hours that isn't Taco Hell, it becomes the best option. 

It's edible and gets the job done, but it's not very good food. I'd never choose to eat there if any other halfway decent mexican food place was open at the time. This place wins by default only. Hell, I'd rather eat at Filibertos and they got busted for serving cat meat.

Another charming thing about Los Betos is that they make up the prices in their heads. You could order the same exact thing there every single night of the week and they would charge you seven different prices. It's bizarre, but amusing. Their food is really cheap anyway, so it's not like it matters."}
{"text":"Had an awesome breakfast burrito this morning. A lot for your money. Better than the Filibertos across the street & cheaper. Love their Cali burrito!"}
{"text":"Looooove this place! The breakfast burritos are always delicious, will keep coming back here for sure. :)"}
{"text":"It was almost impossible for me not to stop here on the cab ride back from old town for carne asada fries.mmmm sooo good! I really only went there between the hours of 2-4am but, los betos never let me down."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  This place is a hidden gem.  I actually ate the Spanish rice that came w the combo. Everything was served fresh and hot.  Has a home made feel to it.  Great Mexican fast food."}
{"text":"Bought my son a burrito and after stealing 2 bites of it I had to turn around and get my own. Their breakfast burritos are amazing no matter what time of day.  Food was hot and fresh, and the tortillas are wonderful."}
{"text":"What happened to this place.

Ordered 2 California burritos and it was disgusting. There was no taste and the meat was debatable.

Ordered Carne Asada fries and it tasted like mush as well. Fries were soggy and everything else was lacking flavor.

Worst part? I WAS DRUNK WHEN I THOUGHT IT WAS GROSS.. SO YOU KNOW IT WAS PROBABLY PRETTY BAD! AND HOW DID MY BILL END UP BEING $14 FOR 3 ITEMS?!

Nachos from Taco Bell would have been a better choice.. damn it. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"So my friend decided to pick where we'd eat lunch since he was driving.  We ended up at Losbetos.  We went through the drive-thru which wasn't that long of a wait.  I ordered carne asada fries.  I totally forgot how big a full order was and didn't think about order a half order.  We of course took the food to go.  Once we got home, we grubbed.  The food wasn't cold, nor was it hot.  I guess it was somewhat warm.  In general, the food wasn't great, nor was it horrible.  My friend concurred.  As for the hot sauce, it sucked.  It wasn't even spicy at all.  Tasted like watered down tomato juice or something.  The place looked pretty authentic to me...what a shame.  Maybe ordering from here will taste better on another day.  That's what my friend said who's a regular.

They take credit card, even American Express."}
{"text":"Do not eat here!   The food is tasty--greasy, cheesy goodness, but my husband found a piece of plastic like from the top of a bottle or something in his chimichanga.  CRAZY.  How does that even happen?!?!?"}
{"text":"Breakfast Burrito and lots of extra hot sauce. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this place.  I've been going to Los Betos for years.  For some reason it only agrees with me late at night.  Anytime I get it between the hours of 9am-11pm, it's disgusting.

I love their beef burritos and Super Natchos.  Super Natchos weigh at least 3 pounds."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for breakfast one morning when I was in a hurry for work. Got a burrito bowl. The surprising thing was for potatoes, they used french fries. I've done that at home before when I forgot I was out of hash browns or real potatoes, but I was not expecting that from a restaurant.
Aside from that, it was a good breakfast, not short on bacon or cheese."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's right down the street from my work so I eat here often. Every single employee is super friendly to me and the food is great.  
The breakfast burritos are to die for delicious, big chunks of crispy, meaty  bacon, no bacon fat. 
I also love the Carne Asada and chicken burritos, the Came Asada is always grilled perfectly and the chicken is stewed in a tomato based sauce. The Enchilada plate is pretty amazing as well and you can't beat the convenience of the drive through."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. I ordered 2 burritos through their drive thru and sat there for more than 15 minutes. At that point I went inside to ask what the problem was and the cashier (Clara) told me my food had been ready but they just hadn't gotten it to us. So when they finally gave us our food we asked to speak to a supervisor or manager and she proceeded to tell me that they weren't there and that there are never managers there so I wouldn't be able to talk to anyone. I asked when they would be there in the future so that I could call and she told me they wouldn't ever be there. I asked for her name and the managers name and she gave me 2 different managers names so who knows if she just gave me fake names. Clara was the absolute worst. She was so rude and disrespectful and slammed the drive thru door in my face. I was visiting in town and told my friend that I was with they had to try this restaurant because of how great it was. I always stop by when I'm in town but that will never happen again and I will tell everyone I can find that they should never visit this establishment. I'm very sorry if you ever go there and have to be mistreated by their staff and especially Carla."}
{"text":"Don't know where these other reviewers ate but this dump should be closed down.  My wife and I tried it and  got some enchiladas and a tostada to go. The cook was back there with no gloves on and wiping his hands on his apron continually. The enchiladas hardly had any meat in it and had mostly strips of green bell pepper in it. Then where the sauces are it was filthy. Crap everywhere. Told the counter person and he acted like who cares. Am reporting this place to the health department."}
{"text":"When it comes to taco stands, this place is the king. Their breakfast chorizo is without a doubt the best I have ever had.. honestly can't find a place that makes it as good. 

You can't go wrong with any of their burritos. Huge size and amazing. I dream about these suckers. 

As far as other menus, I think their rolled tacos and super nachos. Food is always hot. There is a drive thru and a walk up window but it's absolutely worth it to get it and bring it back to work. My favorite of all the betos."}
{"text":"I haven't been Yelping much lately...too, too busy!

But happily busy (busy means money and while the money may not buy happiness, it will rent you a parking space so that you can park the Bentley and stroll on over to happiness...so more is good!).

So I was surprised and delighted to receive a missive from Yelp HQ in my inbox...less so when I broke the seal on my mail and discovered that a photo in one of my reviews had been \"flagged by the Yelp Community and removed because it fell outside the photo guidelines\" .

Which review, you ask?...why the one directly below this one.

I thought for a moment about who would flag a small graphic in an obscure review about a third rate taco stand in South Scottsdale...and decided I didn't have a clue!

So I went to Los Betos to do a little investigating (and to have lunch...they may be third rate, but they still make delightfully greasy and satisfying rolled taco's...I had three of the little boogers!).

As I sauntered up the window (I was going to do drive through, but then I would miss the full Los Betos experience...dining under an umbrella, in the grease vortex that perpetually swirls between Los Betos and Whataburger, plus, I needed to be on foot to do my best Magnum P.I. investigative work).

I ordered my rolled tacos and salsa and then asked casually \"Hey, have you guys flagged any cute little graphs in a Yelp review of Los Betos, lately?\"

The sweet little undocumented worker behind the counter either said \"¿Quién, yo?\" or \"do chu wan rice 'n bean\"...I can't be sure.

In any event, the food was, as always, decent...no one stuck their thumb in my tacos.

The service was fine, if incomprehensible (much like the explanation from Yelp HQ, as to why my little graph didn't meet photo guidelines:)

The grease was pretty fresh (and now I am lubed for days:)

I guess I'll never know the answer to who flagged my little chart, or why (although I have my suspicions about the Bertos/Betos conglomerate and their minions).

I was going to take a photo of the grease traps behind Los Betos and post those, since they are an integral part of the restaurant experience when you are sitting outside and subject to the tornado like cloud of cooking gasses and particulates (unlike my small chart which, while accurately describing the crap to good stuff ratio of my meals at Los Betos, apparently doesn't qualify)...but then I decided, maybe I've made enough mischief for one day:)

Or not."}
{"text":"Just like Sonic I miss this place so much. I have not found a place that can come even close in Boston to the unreal Mexican food \"Betos\" had 24/7. Nothing beat hitting up Betos after a night of drinking or even hitting it up at 7am for a breakfast burrito. You cannot beat their prices, the breakfast burritos are less than 2 bucks and their bigger and as heavy as a brick. Betos will you and Sonic please move franchises to Boston."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a kid. I stopped coming for several years, but recently I decided to give it a go again and fell in love with the place all over again. 

The food has ten times the flavor than the Filibertos across the street does. Don't even try to compare the two, Los Betos is twenty times better. Their food is much more authentic, so if you're looking for real Mexican flavors I recommend this place. I will say, don't expect high quality, best-Mexican-I've-ever-had food; its not gonna happen here. However, its fast, convenient, and the closest place where I can get GOOD burritos (I've had so many that have tasted like cardboard its ridiculous... Ahhem, Filibertos). 

I recommend the \"California\" burrito, by far my favorite. Or the \"pastor\" burrito. Also, the carne asada is very good and if you want something cheap but filling they have 5 tacos for $5.95 I think and they're pretty good too. Also, if you want the carne asada fries but aren't sure if it'll be worth the $10, let me tell you it is, they're big, delicious, and smell divine. 

The service is also the best. I love coming and talking to the people who work there, always friendly and know how to make you smile. Oh and if you ask for pickled jalapeños (in Spanish they're called jalapeños en vinagre) they will also provide them (free of charge). 

It's a local business, so you can't feel bad for spending your money here. 

Happy eating"}
{"text":"Excellent dive for burritos.  No indoor seating.  Would go back again.  Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I'm the kind of gal that needs greasy, cheesy, spicy, yummy goodness after a rough night out.
Los betos has been my go to spot for the right kind of cure.
My favorite burrito is the California burrito, no pico de gallo, add beans. I order this every time and it does it's trick.
I recommend you get this burrito and you'll never go back to a different kind of burrito."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos all day, 'er day! 

It's delish. You will not be disappointed. If you are not acclimated to hot sauces, I would suggest you NOT put the red sauce inside the burrito. 

The red and green sauce are AUHMAZIN' though. 

All I can say is... don't judge a book by its cover. Pull on up to the drive thru and experience some mouth watering breakfast burritos (they have other items on their menu) 24/7."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos long enough to make a porn star go DAMN...

This unassuming drive through houses some legit burritos. I have had both the bacon and egg burrito, and the carne asada. While the carne asada one doesn't keep pace with burritos I got back in SD, the bacon and egg is seriously tasty. Extra large tortillas stuffed and wrapped correctly, it literally is enough for two meals.  Their salsas are decent as well. 

While it may not get a Michelen star anytime soon, they have an A health inspection sign proudly posted, and drive through service is quick and efficient. It will easily be a choice when I'm running late or too tired to make my own breakfast in the morning!"}

{"text":"Im not sure what kind of person checks yelp for a Mexican fast food joint with a drive thru  - usually best for after the bar closes. It's what you would expect. Greasy, filling, sauce laden, cheese covered Mexican food in a styrofoam box.
75% of the menu comes out of a deep fryer - these places are on every corner in Scottsdale and are pretty much the same. Not as cheap as they should be but they are sure to fill you up.

{"text":"We absolutely love Los Betos!  We have always been treated well and the food is always hot and fresh!  We have breakfast from here at least once a week and it's also our late night snack place!  The breakfast burritos are big enough for 2 people, and the tacos are always stuffed too!  The tortas are also outta this world!  Never get sick from it like other places either!"}

{"text":"So one day for lunch I was craving a burrito. This location is across the street from a filibertos so I was kinda in limbo of which one to go to. After reading a few reviews I decided Los Betos. I honestly do not know why I punish my stomach during work hours with fast food burritos. Anyhoo, I ordered the California burrito with a bit of sour cream. I also asked for some salsa. 

The Burrito was mostly tortilla and potato... I was pretty upset at the fact I wasted money on this thing. The crappy made and carb burrito was decent and let's be honest with each other.... I asked for this, I Damn well knew this was gonna happen. If your looking for a bomb burrito, dont visit a fast food chain ending in betos!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this place could potentially kill someone. That's alright with me ;)

Great if you want a huge greasy breakfast burrito, or a clogged artery. Either way, they're open 24 hours a day, and they're quick to get your order out.

I got the chips (plain), and a sausage breakfast burrito to go with the cocktail I made at home. I got through about half of that burrito and was stuffed to the brim. These things are pretty large, but don't let the previous reviews hype up the size. It was a good 12 inches long, and almost 3 inches in diameter. Packed with cheese, sausage, and eggs. My boyfriend ordered the chrizo and told me the chrizo was a bit over cooked (figured maybe they used left overs from the day before) and he would have liked a little more egg in there. It was a good pound of pure chrizo and maybe 1 scrambled egg total in that thing.

Nobody got sick.

After my breakfast burrito sat in the fridge for 30 minutes and I pulled it back out for a few more bites, it wasn't worth eating. All the grease formed solid, so I trashed it.

I'd go back again. Maybe next time I'll clog my arteries with cardne asada tacos.

PS: The chips aren't that great. But cocktails make everything delicious.

2 stars goes to food quality
1 star goes to it being open 24 hours"}
{"text":"Vegetarians Beware
Two days ago we ordered 2 potato, egg, cheese & bean burritos & 1 bean tostada. When we got home, 1 burrito had no beans & the other had a bunch of meat. I called & some man told me I could come back the following day & said he'd take care of it. We couldn't return until 2 days later & got nothing because I didn't get a receipt that night and he did not leave a note (after waiting 5 minutes while the woman checked.) She would not rectify the problem so that's the end of our 15 year Los Betos history. I'll just make the short extra trip to Fiesta Burrito on McDowell, between Miller Rd & Scottsdale Rd. It's better anyway!"}
