{"text":"Awesome pizza, very good perch dinner.  Best sweet potato fries I've ever had.  Katie was an absolute pleasure. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a place I would return, just was not overly impressed. Came here twice within the last couple months, and enjoyed my experience. Staff was always friendly and very prompt. The first time I was here, I hoped to order the Chicken Paprikash (which is supposed to be a specialty here) but they were already out for the day. I ordered some Cajun BBQ wings and was definitely pleased. I'm usually pretty picky about wings growing up around Buffalo, NY but these were solid, and would suffice if I was craving wings. We also shared some mac and cheese bites which were fine, but nothing exceptional. The second time, I came earlier in the day, to make sure that I could get some of the Chicken Paprikash before it ran out. I felt this was pretty bland, especially for something that was such a specialty.
I would come back here again, as the location is pretty convenient for us, but I wouldn't stress to run back to try the specialties again."}
{"text":"Nice place. Very nice outside patio and location. Prices are ok. Had the BBQ burger and it was awesome. The beef was top notch. Wife had Cobb wrap and lived it, great flavor. Bathrooms are hot and very dirty. Only bad part of this place. Inside bar is beautiful."}
{"text":"I really like what they've done to the place. The exterior renovation of the building is really amazing.  The sweet potato fries are good. Decent beer list and nice patio."}
{"text":"Tradesman's Tavern had that  typical Ohio neighborhood pub feel to it, but roomy because it's a good size place. Choose to sit on a bar stool at the large bar in the center of the room or at one of several  tables all around. There is also a nice size outdoor patio with its own bar. Servers are friendly. Prices are really beyond reasonable!
What's anything but typical is the food.  This is better than regular \"bar food\".  A house side salad is plentifully served on a dinner plate & was really nice - not just bagged lettuce tossed on a plate. I ordered the wings - 10 for $5 and they were tasty, moist & meaty.  Several different rubs to choose from & the garlic parmesan was a good choice. Friends ordered the burgers & all were happy. 
Drinks also reasonably priced. All in all its a good place for friends to meet & enjoy without spending a fortune."}
{"text":"Before you eat here please walk out to the patio. On your way out take a gander in their kitchen, something I wish I had done before eating at this establishment. I ordered the chicken wings, a cheese pizza and their nacho appetizer. The food showed up relatively quick, however the place was slow that night. The chicken wings were pre-cooked, frozen garbage doused in bottled teriyaki sauce. The pizza was burnt, rubbery and disgusting. The sauce tasted like they took a 10# can of tomatoes, threw some sugar in it and brought it to a boil. No salt, no seasoning, no herbs. The dough was covered in burnt flour. The nachos were the only thing they managed to not screw up, which isn't hard considering the cheese was bagged and everything on top came out of a can. Following this disgusting meal, of which we consumed 2 pieces of pizza, 2 wings and most of the nachos, we decided to step out on the patio. While walking out there, I glanced into the wide open kitchen. The wings were sitting on the counter at room temperature in a bus tub. Next to the wings was a stainless steel soup bane that was black and looked like it hadn't been though the dish machine since the got it. There was a hole in the floor, the cook was wearing a cut off tee shirt, which goes against state health code. The fryers had a layer of grease on them that made it look rusted. Please take caution while eating here. Or better yet don't risk it at all. On the up side, the beer was cold and refreshing. The service isn't the worst, the bartender was friendly and up beat, and we got our check within 3 minutes of asking for it."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident, was driving around looking for food and pulled into a parking lot to turn around and noticed this place in Yelp .  Great little bar in Cleveland.  I was astounded by the beauty of the woodwork, the tiling, abs the decor.  Made a quick friend with one of the regulars who introduced me to the owner.  You could tell he was passionate about showcasing the tradespersons who built things by hand: whether it was the gorgeous mirror behind the bar , the stained glass windows, or the mural on the wall.  He also shared his love for Soapbox derby racing and getting the community and kids involved.  Delicious ( almost addicting) pirogies , decent pizza  and a small but enjoyable selection of beer on draft."}
{"text":"This place sucks in every way possible. The food is pathetic. They would have better luck just serving bologna sandwiches. Terrible service, besides the poor hygiene the white trash bartenders are terrible at their job and have no personality.

The dozen people I know that have mentioned this place all have had very bad things to say about this place. Oh and two girls I know mentioned it was the creepiest place they have ever been.

I am usually an easy guy to please, but good lord this place is disgusting!"}
{"text":"Paprikash was cold and  tasted like flour, sent it back YUCK! burger was mediocre at best glad it was only $5, nothing to write home about, the deep fried cheese appetizer was good but the marinara needed alot of help, nice waitress, and was attentative, the atmosphere is great, food is much to be desired, wish it was better, looked like a great place to go,"}
{"text":"Went in with my Mom and friend for the first time and had a great experience.  We had a few drinks and food. Definitely recommend their pizza and salad.  You can tell it's a local place, but you don't feel like an outsider.  It's a nice, big place that I will definitely be going back to soon"}
{"text":"Their spinach and artichoke pizza is the best I've had!!! Bartender was nice and attentive"}
{"text":"This is a good neighborhood bar. The chili was thick and tasty. My friend had a burger w home made chips. She liked her meal and the drinks were good. 

The bartender served us at a table, and was attentive and polite. It was quiet on a monday night. I'd like to try their pierogies next time. 

They have parking out back. This isn't far off 480 so a good midway mtg point."}
{"text":"This place is okay if you go with the right people. The music is often really random, and the bartenders are SO rude. However, the drinks are strong and there's enough room to sit or stand if you choose. The dance area looks like a middle school dance, with that awkward grinding that you tried your best to avoid. The staff is too focused on socializing with themselves, and are not friendly."}
{"text":"Met up with old friends at this place in Parma, first thing I noticed is that it's very nicely put together and clean!
Weird thing? Music did NOT match decor because it was some sort of slowed down death metal thing that was very offputting...Thankfully they didn't rack it elsewise I'd made some calls to get the farkleberry outta there....
Wel it was karaoke night and we carried good conversation above the caterwalings of the dude that was singing Chriss Cross's Sailing...

\"Hello Cleeeeeeeeeveland!\"

couple beers at happy hour pricing...Nice...Got a pizza that my one buddy didn't like but I did...Homemeade crust and sauce! Actually delish!!!!!
It's a strange place though...."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go! Amazing food, great service, and being able to sit out on the patio with my dog in the summer is so awesome! The only thing that I CANNOT stand is the DJ that starts blaring and I mean blaring the music. It's quite horrific. Unfortunately as soon as they start the music it's time for me to go because of how loud it is. I can hardly hear the person next to me. Other than that I really like it here."}
{"text":"Pretty nice bar. The drinks are SUPER cheap, which is definitely nice. The bartenders are hit or miss- sometimes when I go I get great service, and sometimes the bartenders are too busy socializing with each other to help customers. I've never tried the food. For a night out with friends, I would for sure recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love their chicken wings and the classic Cleveland dish, chicken paprikash is done right (and enough for 2)"}
{"text":"Was taken there for lunch and liked it alot. In the evening its a better crowd. Great place to go in the summer as they have a patio."}
{"text":"Love this place. I go here with my Fiance all the time. Beer is great, food is great, and best of all staff is great."}
{"text":"The bar is the center of the room with tables on both sides. There is an outside patio, but it was too cold to check it out. On a Saturday night the place was not very busy. There was a DJ but the music was too loud to talk. We ordered pizza that was more like tomato sauce on pizza dough- very disappointed. The 2 bartenders were fine, but the bar was only 1/2 full."}
{"text":"Just wanted to give a quick update on this local bar to reflect my recent experience. The setting: it's November 1st, 2016. The Indians are in game 6 of the World Series. Like probably most bars in the area, just about every seat of the Tradesman Tavern has an ass in it. 

I rarely have such good service that I call a manager to compliment, but that's what happened when I left the Tradesman tonight. Even with how packed the crowd was for the game, it didn't take longer than a couple minutes to get a drink and the food orders came out quick, properly, and delicious. I interacted with everyone from the indoor and outdoor bartenders to the kitchen and wait staff and the manager -- I've been to the Tradesman a number of times, and even with the uncharacteristicly large crowd because of the game, the staff maintained a great level of personalism.   

Also, I hate to give such a \"neg\" compliment after such a wonderful experience, but for the occasion I went off my beaten path of my normal salad order from here and happened to add a side of fries - I would have never expected a random little Parma bar to have SUCH delicious fries. Maybe the best I've ever had, even better than some (okay, all) of the fancy schmancy \"comes with rosemary and a side of garlic aioli\" fries. A new serious -- and given the proximity to my home, dangerous -- contender in my rotation of cheat meals. 

I knew Tradesman was a good local bar with good food, but tonight they definitely proved themselves to be great. Roll Tribe, Roll Tradesman!"}
{"text":"Been awhile since I've been in but I'll be back the pizza and wings where spot on . I think the plum garlic sauce was our favorite"}
{"text":"YASSSSS. 

Good music, good draft beer, and close to my house. Not much more I need on a weekend night when I just want to have a chill night. 

I don't know if it's worth traveling miles away to visit, but if you're in Parma or the vicinity I think it's worth a visit. Beer prices are fair. They had a lot of beers on draft that I really like but can't find other places (Columbus IPA, Southern Tier Pumpking, etc). We just drank, didn't eat, but place was hoppin on a Friday night. We want to return!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are regulars here for Wednesday Wing Night. They have nice fat wings with different flavors like Chipotle Mayo and Garlic Plum. We normally sit at the bar in the winter or the spacious patio on the summer. This is a step above the local bar fare. Service is usually top notch. I would also recommend Taco Tuesdays.  :-)"}
{"text":"The Tradesman is my favorite local bar. It's low key and relaxed. The staff is always friendly and down to earth. This is definitely not a stop to make when you're in a rush but rather it runs at a slower pace. The customers are friendly also. You'll always end up making small talk with a stranger. Drinks are dirt cheap and the food is reasonably priced. Try their chicken teriyaki pizza. It's fantastic!  I also like how they support local events, especially those within the Ukrainian community. They're always willing to put up a message on their exterior sign--all you have to do is ask. If you need a regular, neighborhood bar I'd highly suggest The Tradesman Tavern as your go to."}
{"text":"Summer nights are fun out on the patio although there seems to be fights more often than expected. After 10:00 PM, the bar goes down hill. Some nights it's just the wrong crowd and other nights it seems to be that some are simply over served. With that being said, I still feel very safe at this bar. The location is great being close the the fire department and main road intersection. Parking is easy to find considering the bank next door usually allows the bar to use it. Bathrooms are clean but need to be fixed up. Food is served quickly but I'm usually there for drinks. The DJ is WAYYYY too loud. You can't even hear yourself think. I'm all for loud music, but I'd like to be able to order my beverage without writing it down for the bartenders. The entire building seems to shake when the DJ is there. Music is a must, but turn it down a little. Bar is laid back allowing us to have large groups attend and even move tables for a safer dance floor. If you're trying to go out and hang out with your friends, maybe this bar isn't best for you. But if you like the downtown scene and don't want to you downtown prices, tradesman is a nice spot."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with some family members, who insisted the burgers here were to die for.  I was very underwhelmed.  It tasted like your typical bar food to me, nothing special.  It wasn't awful, but it's not worth making a trip for."}
