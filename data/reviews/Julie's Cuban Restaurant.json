{"text":"I have been at Julie's many many many times. I love it! The only reason of why I am not giving a 5 start rating is because I don't understand why this place is sooooo over priced. The food is good, I am Cuban so I know, but sometimes I think it misses the real final flavour."}
{"text":"it is an adorable space, and the food we ordered was very good, with large portions. sadly their drinks are very expensive, prohibitively so in my opinion. a shame. perhaps a happy hour would help?"}
{"text":"We took some people from out of town here and the four of us had a great time.  The drinks were delicious, yay mojitos.  We shared eight plates of tapas and we really enjoyed pretty much all of it.  The server had recommended we get ten plates, but that would have been waaaay too much food.  It was a lovely summer evening and we got to sit on the patio. It's a nice little spot that if you walked too fast you would miss it.  Totally going back!"}
{"text":"Went here with my partner for an anniversary. The ambiance is perfect. The food, however was just kind of okay. Had the guacamole tostones, the blue marlin ceviche and the calamari. All of it lacked a little seasoning and some love. Similarly, my cocktails lacked a certain yumminess and flare. I think I might try it again, but as for my original experience, it was just okay."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere--front shaded patio, warm interior, and attentive service--in a pleasant out-of-the-way residential location, but the food is fairly bland and relatively pricey. I really wanted to like this place, but it was really a sub-par proposition...I spent more then I typically spend on a really good meal and got OK food that left me hungry. Sorry Julie!"}
{"text":"Never a bad meal here. Always try something different and always impressed.  If you go before 6pm they have a happy hour with cheap drinks and food priced at $1, $2 and $3."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and I can still find a lot to eat at Julie's. The corn fritters are amazing. The Pappa Rellina is fantastic. The avocado salad, amazing. The atmosphere is incredibly romantic. The staff is super friendly and the service is attentive and quick. I'm proud to have Julie's in my hood"}
{"text":"Julie's was yummy. Food was definitely pricier than I am used to for Latin/Mexican food. Snacks & Drinks for two was over $70.   I have some pictures on my blog of what we had, if you wanna have a peek."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto for many years, before Toronto became the foodie city it is. Such a cute little place, amazing service and delicious food."}
{"text":"It's been 13 days since my Julie's Cuban Experience. I think that's ample time to give a reasonable review.  First off, let me just say that I SO BADLY wanted to love this place. I had been wanting to try it since we moved into the neighbourhood in 2006 but for whatever reason, hadn't had the chance. One night about 2 weeks ago we walked past it on a rainy Friday night and I thought \"Let's just go inside and ask if there's a table, what the hell, if not, we move on\".    Immediately I was charmed by the atmosphere, the music and twinkly lights, the warm, homey feeling of the place. It was crowded and we were walk-ins but my hopes soared higher when the super nice hostess managed to find us a table in the back room (which I was FINE with, unlike the group of harpies seated at the table beside us who  repeatedly hounded the poor hostess until she moved them to the front room).  We ordered drinks and our dinner and happily prepared for a night of good food and mojitos.  Said mojitos arrived promptly and were tasty (yet I have had better for the price).  Our appetizer (bland guacamole made from unripened avocados served with bagged Tostitos chips) plunked down on table without charm (each item was delivered to our table by a different waitress). Dinner (two seperate entrees..basically meat and beans, one served with sliced bananas - not plantains, i know the difference) arrived soon afterwards and thats when things went down hill.   The food was bland and underwhelming, reminiscent of the \"locals\" section at a tropical resort's buffet. Let me state that I am very familiar with latin food and I know that cuban food can be on the bland side...but I also know when food isn't good, especially for the price.  I had checked in on foursquare and a friend texted me to say that I should skip the entrees and instead order the tapas. \"Ah,\"  I thought to myself \" That's where we went wrong. Oh well, I'll come back some time and sit on the patio and we'll order up a whole bunch of dishes and try again.\"  I maintained this attitude for another 35 minutes or so, desperately clinging to it like a drowning man to a life preserver as my opinion of Julie's sunk like the Titanic (sorry for all of the metaphors, I'm feeling dramatic). I made several excuses to my dining companion who was less than pleased.  For the rest of our time at Julie's we were invisible. No one came by to ask how our food was. I had to flag down a passing waitress to ask for a drink (I said \"excuse me\" and she turned and pissily said \"what's up?\" to me..I was taken aback but maintained politeness because that's how my momma raised me) and then the drinks never arrived. The three waitresses we had during the evening seemed to visit every table but ours. Empty glasses sat and food hardened on plates. We resorted to entertaining ourselves with the giant map of the world pinned to the wall beside us, picking out which places we'd rather have been then there.  Finally we managed to flag down a random waitress and ask for our bill. One of the original waitresses we had during the evening (a nice one) came back to collect it so I made sure that I still tipped (only 15%) because I know what the food industry is like and I refuse to be a jerk. we politely thanked the waitress and left, vowing (quietly, to each other) to never return.  As we walked away I looked longingly back at that gorgeous patio, dreams of hot summer nights under the twinkly lights, icy mojitos in hand crumbling before me. We won't be back and that makes me sad because Julie, i REALLY wanted to like you."}
{"text":"If you don't mind paying WAY over the odds for mediocre food, Julie's is the place for you.  I could understand the price points if I was a suit in a slick King West \"place to be seen\", but this is a \"cute\" little place in which decor wise everything is clearly cheap (aka authentic Cuban).  This should be reflected in the price of the food.  No draft beer (a cardinal sin in my opinion), so they sell bottles for $6!!!  A mojito was $9!!  None of my party of 4 had a drink as we were all put off by the prices.  The most scandalous rip I've ever come across in the history of eating out was the Chicken Quesadilla, it was a special and they were charging $14, when it came out I almost fell off my plastic chair, it was so small we hardly had a bite each, shameful to be charging $14 for that.  It was not superior in taste to any mexican restaurant either.   We had to send back a mushroom and garlic stuffed potato, because there was no filling when we cut it open.  When we got the next one, it was cold in the middle.  Very disappointed, had lived in the area for a couple of years and always wanted to try Julie's, wish I hadn't bothered.  Also wish I had heeded the words of other reviewers, who seemed to have the same issues.  The corn fritters were very good.  Service was pleasant.  Basically if you have very little concept of value for money, and you like \"cute\" places that will help you take your mind off the prices, well then by all means have at it hoss!!"}
{"text":"I was surprised to read such mixed reviews about this place.  I love the story, the atmosphere and the food.  While perhaps not the destination for your next gastronomic experience, this is a wonderful, quaint neighbourhood gem with great home cooked food.  My full review with photos is available here: http://thingsthatareawesome.com/2013/08/15/date-night-julies-cuban/"}
{"text":"The BEST Cuban food in Toronto...and I'm talking REAL Cuban food....the same taste and variety I remember from my childhood, made by gramma and mom back in Cuba. I wish I could go every day!!"}
{"text":"On the recommendation of a friend, I brought my partner here for his birthday dinner.  Thanks to other Yelp reviews, we were diligent and didn't walk right past it!  It was a Tuesday - the first day \"back to school\" - so the place was very quiet.  We got to sit at a table in a little nook by the window, which was cute and romantic.  I'd recommend reserving that awesome table if you can.  We especially enjoyed the avocado salad, salsa, chorizo, and calamari.  The food was a little bit expensive for us - we probably wouldn't go back unless it was a special occasion....and we'd order less!  We definitely overordered (salad, chips and salsa, and 5 dishes was a lot...and we love to eat!).  The real highlight is the atmosphere and the staff.  The staff were amazing - attentive, patient, and friendly.  When I sheepishly asked if we could have a piece of cake/pie with a candle, they were actually excited to sing the birthday song, and one staff member even did a little dance!   Thanks, Julie's staff, for making a birthday dinner so memorable and special."}
{"text":"Really nice patio space for summer dining, but the food is overrated and the service is only average. Overpriced considering food quality and portion sizes."}
{"text":"I love Julies Cuban because it's on a residential street filled with houses and it's like a little secret discovery when you come upon it. It's really charming and comfortable with it's checkerboard tablecloths and homey atmosphere. There's a wall of turquoise shelves filled with antique radios, classic boardgames, retro records, old books and photographs which makes me feel like I\"m stepping in someone's home. Plus the service there is unpretentious, inviting and so gracious. In the summer, there's a little patio that you can enjoy people watching and the BEST mojitos in the city and a great place to take a date!"}
{"text":"Great food,price and atmosphere.  Love the vibe . Everything tasted amazing! This place is a hidden gem,  cannot believe it is not always packed."}
{"text":"I think Julie's needs a review from a Cuban.  Well, half Cuban, half Colombian, born in the US, and officially Canadian since last fall.  I've been in Toronto for 7 years now and the lack of options when it comes to eating Latino food is quite disappointing especially for such a diverse city.  Granted, I cook a lot of hispanic food at home but it's just nice to have someone else do it for a change.  So it was with great joy that I learned of this little piece of Cuban heaven a couple years back.  And I was not disappointed.    I'm no food critic, but hopefully the fact that I'm Cuban, have been there twice, and have eaten the food all my life gives me a good foundation to base my opinions on.  I agree with most here that the tapas offered are delicious.  The yuca con mojo tastes just like my father makes it.  The garlic shrimp, tostones rellenos, and frituras de maiz are all exceptionally good.  The mains are great too, although I usually eat the ropa vieja.  It's one of my favorite dishes that I haven't quite gotten the hang of cooking well myself.  My wife usually tries different dishes and has enjoyed them all.  Although she likes my shrimp enchilada and arroz con pollo better.  (I'd have to agree)  =)    My only complaint would be that they should add one more main dish.  Goat.  That would make it truly authentic since it is a Cuban staple.  More so than beef.  And I can't forget to mention how delicious the mojitos are!    As far as the price goes, it is a bit expensive for hispanic food in general.  When I took my parents there, my father couldn't let me forget that he could probably get the same food on Bergenline Ave. in Jersey City or Collins Ave. in Miami for half the price.  But then again, Cuban restaurants are on every corner in those cities.    Julie's is one of very few hispanic restaurants in the city, but that doesn't stop it from serving excellent food in a wonderful atmosphere.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"When we first moved in to the nieghbourhood this was one of the only places to go. The food is good and the service is really nice. Last night we visited again, and Sylvia, the owner, who's been running the place for 14 years, was there. A whole group of cubans were in dining and they left almost when we arrived, and they were very happy and thanking Sylvia for providing a very authentic experience. If they liked it, it seems like it must be authentic.  The patio both in the front and back are both nice, although last night we ate inside.  But yes, the prices are high. I'd go 3x as much if the prices weren't quite so high."}
{"text":"Mmm - Que rico! My husband and I usually have to drive an hour to get Cuban food where we live in Michigan (I'm Cuban myself).  I must say, the food here was excellent! I was happy that they served Picadillo and they even had appetizers with Picadillo on them.  The food was a little pricey for the small portions, but overall highly satisfying.  The plantains were absolutely amazing, though. The atmosphere was adorable and appropriate.   I gave my appreciation to the chef :)"}
{"text":"Small portions at high prices. Not close to being real Cuban food. I am part Cuban so I should know. I don't understand what the hype about this place is?! Avoid at all cost!!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! This place is nestled away on a quiet residential street and looks deceivingly understated. Once inside you'll be greeted with walls of kitschy -but lovely- decor.  Fresh ingredients, pitchers of sangria and little tapas plates make this a great intro to Cuban food plus it's a lot of fun. The highlight was absolutely the corn fritters."}
{"text":"Julie's Cuban Restaurant (aka Julie's Snack Bar as per the signage up top) is the jam!  Tucked in between Queen and Dundas, on Dovercourt, Julie's is (somehow) a quick getaway from the city.  Dovercourt, being predominantly residential, is an unassuming road to venture down for eats, and Julie's maintains the low-key vibes to a T!  Their patio offers a great view of the (very) local traffic.  They've got a well stacked bar including some great wines, so hanging out here - just for drinks, or for your entire meal - is always a good time!  Inside Julie's, you REALLY feel like you're on a getaway!  The fading aqua-painted shelving, the Cuban poster-ads, the red and white gingham vinyl tablecloths -- she's got it all!  The menu does NOT disappoint.  They've got fantastic tapas options.  The Tostones Rellenos (plantain cups stuffed with either picadillo or shrimp or avocado) are unreal!  The majority of Tapas dishes are either plantain or shrimp based, and none of them have disappointed this guys palette to date.  The main plates are typical - large portions of meat with sides of rice, beans and plantain.  There's at least one beef, chicken, pork and shrimp option for the mains (again, all tasty!) but my herbivore homies are gonna have to stick to the tapas (not necessarily a bad idea regardless of your eating habits though!).  If you're on a date, grab a window seat.  If you're in a group, try to reserve the back room!   A lovely staff wraps an awesome experience.  Julie, you go girl!"}
{"text":"Julie's Cuban... Mild Disappointment with sprinkles of Ok-ness (is that even a word?!)   I went there last night with my ladies supper club. We were put on the patio which was great. Wonderfully decorated with a lot of charm. (this is what drew us to go there as we have all walked by so many times and thought it was a must eat place in Toronto). The patio was full for a Wednesday night (the inside, mainly empty though...).   We had Gaucomole to start which was delicious. (unfortunately store bought chips accompanied it. I wish they were homemade). We ordered water for the table about 5 times before it actually made its way to us. My girlfriend ordered a coke which was $5.... I've never seen a coke be so much at a restaurant! The food for the most part of deep fried but delicious. I really loved the Quesadillas and the flattened Garlic Bread. My friend's main dish left something to be desired.   The service was TERRIBLE. Slow and forgetful and even though there were 5 of us, they took the liberty of adding an 18% tip to the bill even though I was never told that would be the case and it isn't on the website to my knowledge. Had they not put that on the bill, the tip would have been 15%. We shouldn't feel obligated to leave such a generous tip when the service was horrific.   I recommend going there for an appetizer and some Sangria on a hot day in July. But I couldn't recommend it as a place to get together with friends for dinner.  Too bad. I had high hopes."}
{"text":"Julie's is such a breath of fresh air. It's tucked under a house and had such a family oriented homey atmosphere. Limited food selection but very extensive drinks and cocktail for relatively fair pricing. It's not a very noticeable place because of the low key signage. Which makes this place feel like such a hidden gem! They have a nice looking menue for Cuban food and I'll be back to give each a  try! I will comment on their rum and whiskey list being very nice and they range from bitter to sweet tastes bound to please all taste buds! The kind I tried was sweet caramel taste w a kick which is right up my alley! This place is perfect for a casual night snack or night cap, when you have time to kick back and relax. Don't go if your in a rush it's not that kind of vibe and is very relaxed service and chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"Maybe i'm being unfair, but i'm hispanic and grew up around tons of real cuban food. Definitely lacking in flavour. And everything was so overpriced. It can't be a good sign if not one single hispanic person eats there.   I order the pork and beef hash, that came with saffron rice and a fruit salad. It was so mediocre that i didn't know why i was paying $20 for it.   The corn fritters were really good though. the guacamole was also lacking, and when the waitress asked if we wanted guacamole she made it seemed like it was part of the dinner.   aside from the decor which has a nice cozy feeling to it, don't bother if you actually want real cuban food.   wouldn't go back there.... apparently only hipsters with extra money and no taste buds appreciate it."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Cuban, and instead of looking at Yelp for reviews, my friends and I heard about this place through word of mouth. I had to say, I now am a fan of Cuban food.   The atmosphere was wonderful. It was homey and friendly, and it felt like you were in someone's house while the host was cooking your food. I especially liked the way the bathroom was downstairs.   We started off with the tapas. They were all amazing, especially the plantains. We shared their chicken entree and it was extremely flavorful and full of interesting spices.  The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 was the desert. When we saw Tres Leches on the menu, we immediately ordered it. What we got instead was a lot of whip cream, some weird cookies in it, and a too sweet cake mixture in a big cocktail glass. Not our dream idea of moist tres leches cake.   While this place is cute and nice, I may not actually come here again unless I'm in the area. But it did make me a fan of Cuban food now!"}
{"text":"I submitted a review a while ago, an discovered it was removed.  I have no idea why, I have submitted reviews for other restos in the past without issue.   Ah well.  I don't feel like re-writing the whole thing, but overall is this:  This is not authentic cuban, but rather is roughly Cuban inspired.  Food is OK, not great, definitely not as delicious as the cuban meals I've had in Cuban-run restos in southern Florida, for example.  Portions are small, prices are large.  Drinks are very expensive.  The place has a nice patio, but the place is getting run down.   The service is good.    I think if they lowered the prices (the prices used to be much lower) I might recommend for casual dining.  With current pricing you can get much better elsewhere.    2 cents.  I was dissapointed."}
{"text":"If the thought of $3.95 for a 300ml bottle of Diet Coke frightens you, then you may want to stop reading now. If you're not bothered by the expense, keep reading.  It has been a few weeks since my visit to Julie's, so the specific's on my experience are a bit rough in my memory.  I would have to agree with most of the other reviews on Yelp. What I can remember is that the tables are placed rather  closely together (making for a less than private dining experience), the food is pretty good, but, it ain't cheap."}
{"text":"I've been to Julies maybe 4 times in many years.  The food and menu have not really changed since the first time I went many years back.    By now if you've read at least 2 other reviews you realize this place is near Dundas and Dovercourt on the west side of Dovercourt in what used to be a house.  Part of it's charm is it's location.  The closest pay parking I know of is behind the 7-11 at the corner of Dundas and Dovercourt.    The food is decent but I've had better Cuban food in different places in Florida.  I think one of the downsides to Julies is that the prices are pretty expensive because the tapas if you get a bunch they all add up.    The main dishes are larger of course but a combination of tapas, main meal and drinks will run you into the $$ price range trying to remember that if you order tapas to share, you will need a bunch of them because they are what they are, small portions.  I usually get a beef dish like the ropas viejo (sp?) but the menu does have a nice variety of different foods.  The service is satisfactory and the decor is very hipster type.  It literally feels like you're in somebody's house more than it feels like a restaurant."}
{"text":"A romantic little place tucked away in a residential area on Dovercourt right across the street from Luna Cafe.  Great patio out front with a run down, lawn chair, no frills type of place had me extremely excited to eat here, hoping to get an authentic no bullshit Cuban meal (no real idea what that is exactly).  Started off with a mojito and hemmingway for drinks, guac and chips, 2 cheese quesadilla and red wine chorizo.  FYI, this place is NOT cheap.  You'd expect a rundown shack looking type place to charge accordingly, but damn, it was $8 per drink with everything else costing at least $2-3 more than you'd hope... but hey, if the food's good who cares right?!  Looking at the menu, nearly 70% of the things had plantains in them.  If you hate mixing banana's and meat together like me, you'll just stare at the menu for a while thinking to yourself \"damn, that sounds amazing except for the damn plantains!\". Oh well, suck it up and order it anyways, you might enjoy it.  The guac was pretty delicious, fresh made, flavouful and they gave us a TON.  The chips were amazing and I was convinced they were homemade until I ventured passed the kitchen and saw big open bags of Tostito's Restaurant style =(  Chorizo was very disappointing.  It was tough and chewy, tasted like red wine rubber and lacked any sort of sausage-esque qualities.    The quesadilla was also ho-hum, but I enjoy anything with melted cheese on it so it wasn't all that bad.  For main we split the beef especial which was chile fried ground beef on plantains as well as their special consisting of black bean rice, crunchy stringed beef and vegetables.  The entree's weren't mind blowing but they were tasty enough and made up for the crappy chorizo.  It was fun mixing and matching what we had on the table and creating new combos of flavours and textures.  Really enjoyed adding the ground beef to the quesadilla and guacamole and eating that with rice.  Not how they intended, but good nonetheless.   If this place was a little cheaper, or the food was a little better I would be raving about it, but I'm not totally satisfied.  It's a great place if you want a quiet, romantic affair and want to show off your knowledge of hole in the wall establishments.  It's fun, kitschy and cute, but not impressive."}
{"text":"I feel like I need to say something about Julie's even though I have not been there in over a year. Yes, it is Cuban - but unfortunately it is not good Cuban food. I am originally from Miami, Florida where Cuban food is EVERYWHERE. So, I was very excited when I heard there was a Cuban restaurant in Toronto - but unfortunately I found Julie's did not offer that authentic fabulousness that my tastebuds remember. I found the food very bland and boring which definitely does not reflect anything Cuban. The ambience on the otherhand is good. But - not enough for me to return."}
{"text":"I followed my Guest of Honor through the entrance of Julie's Cuban and was immediately welcomed and seated simultaneously while I was still adapting to the Cuban music and the romantic lighting while seating on the side with white strings of Christmas lights and Cuban paraphernalia which sets the mood for the Sunday evening.  When I finally looked up I was kind of surprised why Rick Bayless(American Celebrity Chef) was serving us and in a Cuban restaurant rather than a Mexican one.  At least in my mind he resembled Rick Bayless but while he might not have first class Chef potential, our waitstaff had his craft perfected to an art even David Adjey would be impressed.   3.5 *Star*  Mojito Cubano - My opinion on this is I didn't seem to taste the Mint nor the Lemon while Rum was there still overwhelmed by Soda.  I'm not a Drink expert so I will say maybe move on to something flavourful that fits the atmosphere such as Pina Colada.  Chips con Guacamole($7.95) - Addictive delicious simply because it was seasoned perfectly and fresh ingredients made it even better.  It was an app but we put this Guac on everything else we got.  We were hesitant to order but our server made the right call.  Ceviche($8.95) - The Blue Marlin because of it's meatiness and thoroughly cooked, it did resemble White Meat Chicken under this  lighting.  Accompanied by Corn Kernels, Bellpeppers and Lemon Juice while extremely light on heat and fresh Herbs.  Put Guac on!  Enchilado de Camarones($8.95) - Medium sized Shrimp was limited while served with Spicy Tomato Salsa that didn't offer enough heat and seemed like regular Shrimp drowned in Tomato Sauce .  Put Guac on!  Tostones Rellenos(Picadillo version $7.95) - Picadillo(Ground Meat & Tomato mixture) did taste nice served on Tostones(Plantain Cups).  It's definitely not something I see everyday as my culture uses more of the Taro Nest as bowls.  Put Guac on!  Boniato($6.50) - It was a special item not listed on Menu and it was spicy as noted from the server, with jalapeño flavour that spreads around your Tongue but it's an enjoyable dish.  I don't remember enough about it but don't put Guac on it.  Use the Sour Cream given if you want to even out the kick."}
{"text":"Don't let the charming, eclectic vibes fool you into thinking that the Cuban cuisine here at Julie's is just as good. I paid over 18 dollars for a plate of very plain pulled pork and some fried plaintain. It wasn't bad, it was alright for your typical \"grubby food\" but for the price that I paid, I expected a more authentic Cuban dish and a larger portion. We all know that pulled pork, beans, and plantain are cheap. The small plate should not cost over 18 bucks for the simplicity of the arrangement and flavors. I just don't think this place has high enough cost-value score in order for me to rate it any higher.   I was in love with the charming, Caribbean family atmosphere in the restaurant and I also love how it's tucked away in the corner of a residential area. There are all these hipster knick knacks that you can take a picture of and instagram while you wait for your food. This is a hipster Cuban heaven for people who don't actually know what good Cuban food (that has an appropriate price tag) should be like.  I would say it's worth a try, food is one of the most subjective things in the world anywyas. Go with some friends and impress them with your hipster, underground taste in just about anything, including restaurants. You'll definitely enjoy the vibes and the fried plantains are quite good if you can get past how soaked the batter is in oil.."}
{"text":"\"Very disappointed with the main Entree\"    I was in Toronto on business and looked up Cuban cuisine off of Yelp. This restaurant and another came up. I reviewed the the ratings. It wasn't very high on the star chart, but I still gave it a try. First let me say that I'm Puerto Rican and also specialize in Puerto Rican cuisine. Okay- Now, I ordered the Yuca al Mojo and a breaded Steak with the Cuban version of rice & beans.   When my Yuca arrived it looked delicious! Well, that's all it did..looked.  I took a bite...wow! the amount of vinegar I took in nearly chocked me. Okay, not a problem.. I have a breaded steak with Cuban Moro coming.   My plate arrived and it looked good... As I began to salivate and the taste buds were spazzing out.. I took the first bite and,......... Lets just say that the Yuca had less vinegar.  Folks- I'm sorry. As a cook, I found this place totally out of touch with Cuban cuisine and in desperate need of a major overall with the menu, presentation of the food and seasoning... In my country of Puerto Rico.. Sofrito and Adobo goes a long way for the Sazon of the food being served."}
{"text":"Ambiance is all this place has going for them.... Everyone below who rated this under 4 stars pretty much summed it up. I took my mom here for her birthday a while back. Service is slow and food disappoints. I didn't get \"fully authentic Cuban food\" when eating at this place. As for the chips - try harder. They tasted like chips you can buy from the store. The best chips I've ever had are freshly made in house @ Valdez on King St. W. If you want to try Cuban - don't bother wasting your time here. Head to Mambo Lounge on the Danforth - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Definitely give this place a try. The interior totally makes me feel like I'm in a typical Cuban roadside tavern. Ultimate kitch, but cool as hell - great ambience and really good cuban beats. The food was nice but not amazing - the cocktails were excellent. I would definitely go back. Staff was super nice."}
{"text":"I live very close to Julie's Cuban, so people always ask me if I'm a regular there, and I have to tell them no. I am not a regular at Julie's because you pay way too much for what you get. The food and the drinks are good but it's all overpriced.  Pluses: The patio. On a nice summer evening, the patio is a relaxing escape from the madness of downtown. It's in the front on tree-lined Dovercourt, and there can be a lot of traffic, but the patio is still relaxing. The corn fritters are delicious. If you do go, they are a must get.  Minuses: Prices. They charge way too much for a drink you can finish in a gulp, and for bite-sized portions of food.   If someone is having a birthday and wants to go, I won't complain. Julie's serves good Cuban food and drink, I just wish they would charge more reasonable prices. So even though I live nearby, I don't go very often."}
{"text":"Oh My Heavens! Thank God for Julie's!  If you've never had real Cuban cuisine, you're not living! I can not rave enough about this sweet Cuban hideaway on Dovercourt. It's my favourite type of hidden gem: house, house, house, house, hidden gem, house, house, house, house.  They have decadent little items I bet you never imagined! Like corn fritters, fried sweet plantains and authentic mojitos... Julie's is a place that will make you happy. Especially in the summertime. The food just tastes nicer then.   My recommendaish? Go in a group of at least four, or more. Order the tapas as per, then share several main courses. There's so much goodness you need to try it all!  Have you made a reservation yet?  (I'm waiting..)  (the number's right there!)  CALL NOW!   (Julie won't let you down.)"}
{"text":"Being avid travellers to, and our love of Cuba, my partner and I have been looking forward to trying out Julie's to get 'a little Cuba' here at home. I took my partner there, as our first time, for his Birthday. We kept our expectations in check hoping to be pleasantly surprised. We weren't.   Only positive, our server was great and the patio quaint.  The negatives. Very overpriced for less than mediocre food and drinks. The mojito was watered down and far from authentic, using a simple syrup (per our server)  in place of cane sugar. The mint was not even muddled, just plopped in the glass. My frozen daiquiri tepid at best. Both not made with fresh lime, but with lime cordial. I tried a Wakalita next and was none more impressed.   Our apps, Yuca con Mojo with a not even close mojo sauce. And a Papa Rallena (potatoe puff picadillo) served on a tea cup saucer with a teaspoon dollop of salsa. Both served piping hot, yet underwhelming.   For our mains, we both ordered the Ropa Vieja. Pulled flank steak with rice and frijoles. It was a huge portion, served piping hot. We were hopeful up to tasting the flank steak... it was like eating rope. Very chewy and hard to swallow, very bland. The rice was fine, but over-piled with canned black beans. Needless to say, the effort it took to try to consume the steak was exhaustive, that I had to put fork and knife down until the server took it away.   I guess we've been spoiled by having the foods of the real Cuba when we are there (we try to stay away from the resort foods), but given the fact that Cubans have far less access to the many, many herbs, spices, meats and vegetables that we in Canada have, you would think that Julie's would easily be able to make authentic Cuban food.   They miss the mark, we miss Cuba, we will not miss Julie's."}
{"text":"Honestly the best corn fritters on the planet. They are melt in your mouth good. This place is lovely, chill and relaxed. It's mall but that is part of the charm, you wouldn't want it any other way. The walls are filled with spanish kitch and the staff are friendly and attendive.  Come here with friends for some shared food, gauc, fritters, dark and stormies. It's like a little holiday but without the tan."}
{"text":"this is the first place i will call pretty that ive reviewed.  its romantic even if you are just sitting across the street leaning on a fire hydrant (hopefully in the rain).   walk into this home thats been converted into a hopping little restaurant, aglow with christmas lights, christmas or not, and you might find your legs doing the bachata or something on their own.  the music is great.  theres a haze of light that smiles on each of the checkered tablecloths as your waitress passes you your status quo mojito or your guanabana juice, my personal fave.  try to speak if you can, after sinking your teeth into a rich, albeit oily, but nonetheless bear brown deep fried corn fritter.  if you close your eyes and go with it, you can pretend its just a big kernel of popped corn and order more like its free refills at the movies.   after that turn to your left towards the kitchen and say as meanly as you can under your breath, \"uno camarones al ajillo, rapido! rapido!\" and then spit on the floor. (for effect man, cmon, go with, go with).  when that arrives youll find that youll be drinking shrimp  - it looks like a shrimp, it tastes and feels like a shrimp, but that garlicky wine covered pink little letter c can be used to wash all the other food down in between orders of guanabana juices.     now before you pull out your guns and shoot up the place, lift up your sombrero, stroke your moustache, and say, \"PAPA RELLENA NUMERO UNO, FLACCA!!\", and watch as a little bomb of flavour comes wrapped in a dynamite ball of a golden potato that you might have to claim as your own as there is only one on each plate.   inside is a steaming treasure of lean ground beef, garlic, onion, red and green peppers thatll blow your mind.  hows does all that sound.  word."}
{"text":"Alright, so it appears that with many eateries in any city, different people (myself included) end up experiencing varying levels of dining experience depending on when they go to an establishment. After reading several of the less than 3 stars review for Julie's I went there on a Friday evening for dinner. Yeah, I went in with some doubt and apprehension but you know what, the entire dining experience turned around for the better on many levels.  The way the interior was fixed up looked somewhat ceremonial in its theme, mingled with an outdoorsy, island bar flare. Right across from where my group sat there is a shelf with lots of vintage pictures, trinkets, dolls, toys and some iconography. And on the top shelf almost dead center, and the only notable bright image on display is a picture of legendary Cuban artiste Celie Cruz, all flashy smiles to outshine the other items on that shelf. And the poster of her is what kept drawing my eyes back to that shelf.  Being the first person to get their I got a blended Mojito while waiting for the rest of my dinner mates to arrive. The subtle taste and affect of the rum did not suddenly kick in until I had gone through half the glass. Thumbs up electric shock to that! And also if you purchase a drink between 5pm and 7pm you'll get $2 taken of from the regular price.  Ok, so on to the highlight of the evening, the food. For the appetizers we respectively picked the Ceviche, the Calamari, Guacamole with Tortilla Chips, The Black Bean Soup, the Coconut deep fried Shrimp, the Shrimp in White Wine and Garlic, and the Potato Puff (the restaurant's take on a Potato Croquette) stuffed with vegetables and mushrooms accompanied with a small helping of tomato salsa.  All the appetizers looks scrumptious and boy did every dish receive get fussed over by almost all seven of us at the table; ok maybe except the black bean soup (it looked like one of those hot sweet bean desserts that are served at dim sum places) but the person who order it finished it all up. At one point the bowl it was served in was full, then half full and then empty. And the same person's Coconut Shrimp looked so crunchy.  The Calamari looked great and it was also polished off by the person who ordered it. The Guacamole did some accompanied (as one reviewed mentioned) with a mixture of Tostitos regular corn chips and scoopables but you know what the pairing worked out well because the chips were fresh and crisp and the Guacamole was just great, and at the first taste you instantly get a good spicy kick from one of ingredient incorporated into the mixture of avocados and chunks of tomatoes. I love my potatoes so I couldn't go easy on the Potato Puff, warm, soft mashed potatoes with a nice veggie and mushroom center and managed to eat it all up, and also the salsa helped to counter the starch and that also had a spicy kick to it. I think the award winner out of the appetizers was the Ceviche. It's been a very long time since I had this dish and I like the different look of it. Usually I've been larger chunks of fish in the salad but at Julie's the fish was cut into very small sized cubes. Why would it be considered a winner? Because the person who ate the first order loved it so much that she got a second one and she claimed that it was filling for her. I had a small spoonful to taste and I also liked it and so did a few others who also tasted some.  And after we had satisfied our taste of the appetizers through our eyes and our mouths to a point, we eagerly waited for the main dishes to arrive. I just want to note that some of our appetizers came with our mains so it ended up looking like we had side-dishes with our main dishes. And also only a few of us got the mains because the other wanted to try a couple of the appetizers. The two dishes that remember seeing was the Ropa Veja, a Cuban signature dish on the menu, a Vaca Frita and the Bistec Empanizado which was tenderized and breaded fried beef steak. And all three of them came with a bed of rice topped with cooked black beans. My dish also came with two sliced of fried plantain. We were amazed by the size of the plates that came and the portions also filled up the entire central part of the plates. I definitely knew that I couldn't finish all of my steak of I probably had two thirds of it and took the rest home. The rice and beans were good together, but let me rave about the plantains. There are similar fried banana snacks in my country and I also shunned them because I never saw the point of eating a fried sweet banana like that. But I tried one of the plantains and ended up eating both slices. And I was surprised by how they tasted. I had never thought that they would taste sweet and I always thought it had a savory flavor since it's always described differently from the bananas that you can peel and eat.   Alright, so I think our group might be planning another trip back to Julie's sometime in the future."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Julie's on Sunday, July 3 with friends and was expected to be wowwed but I was disappointed instead :( We requested that ALL dishes we ordered have NO bell peppers due to allergies, since we were sharing. We found bell peppers in a couple of dishes that not all could enjoy. Our waitress ensured that wasn't any bell peppers but clearly it was tested and tasted by those who could it eat and it was evident. We ordered the pricey paella and was very disappointing. Overall, the ambiance in the restaurant and patio were nice but the quality of food and service lacked."}
{"text":"First of all, I have to say, I love the ambiance of this place with its cute patio right in a neighborhood...sadly not too much love to give after that.  We started with the chips and salsa.  At $6, I expected a pretty nice salsa with housemade chips.  Well, the chips come and I realize that half of them are Tostitos \"Scoops\" (TM) and the other half other Tostitos.  Come on Julie, you're not even trying to pretend that you put some effort into it.  The salsa was spicy but boring with crudely cut large pieces of tomatoes and not much else....really just a pico de gallo.    This was followed by the ceviche ($10).  It doesn't come with chips or bread, but thankfully we had \"Scoops\" (TM) leftover to eat it.  It started off well, but then we realized there were large bits of lettuce wadded up in the ramekin of fish.  Basically, it was just filler to make it look like we'd received a larger portion.  I kind of think the fish was the previously frozen type, as it had none of the charm of a fresh ceviche.    Other dishes were small, overpriced, and underwhelming.  The one nice spot was the platano maduro frito ($5) which was indeed tasty and sweet.    The half liter of sangria was indeed pricy, although it was alright in quality.    Service was pretty uneven and below average.  Some amount of effort was required to get the bill at the end of the night.  Overall, I'm quite puzzled as to why this place is so popular.  All but one of our dishes were substandard and service was poor.  Julie is definitely phoning it in."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing atmosphere, awesome people, loved it!  James was our server - he gave the best recommendations, had a fun personality, and made us want to come back for more!  We ate so much food and would return 100 times more"}
{"text":"I don't get why people are crazy about this place. Perhaps it's a cute place to take a date, but I find the portions here small and the prices high."}
{"text":"Drove right past this badboy - it's really easy to miss, because it's actually located on the bottom floor of a house! Makes for a super cute and intimate atmosphere. Sat on the patio with a picture of creepily staring cats to my left, and some awfully chirpy sounds coming from the bush behind me. We ordered a bunch of tapas - sweet potato fries, quesadilla, and coconut shrimp - all amazing, especially the fries!  Minus one star because our (otherwise friendly and knowledgeable) waitress asked super casually if she could bring us \"some chips and dip to start\" as if it were on the house, and then charged $8 for it. And it wasn't that good."}
{"text":"A friend booked her birthday dinner here and I was utterly puzzled as I walked pass Queen W and deep into a residential street to find Julie's.  It's literally a residential house turned into a restaurant, really cosy and extremely hipster.  We had an entire room for the birthday dinner and that made it really intimate.  It felt like we were at grandma's old house.  There was a world map on the wall from the 80's.  The server was really good with the rowdy group, which included a guy that kept making inappropriate jokes.  I've never had cuban food before, but I would describe it as a mix of what I think is Polish and Jamaican... sorry if that's really offensive.  I had the rice and beans with veal cutlet, fried plantains and sour cream.  It was delish."}
{"text":"I love Latin food, toss a black bean my way and I'll dance toward it, mouth agape and ready to catch.   So when my boyfriend suggested we got to Julie's Cuban for Valentine's Day, I was thrilled.  The thrill continued when I walked off a beautifully snowy, mostly residential West End street (flowerlessly I might add,) to find a quaint, dimly lit, Latin paradise with fake palm trees, tikki lounge lighting and antique maps of South America plastered on the walls.  I noticed also while taking in my dream restaurant that the staff were all authentic Latinos - good sign - but more notably, the clientele was not -- bad sign.  That said, the food turned out to be not so amazing and the atmosphere grew a little old, the longer we sat and waited for the bill.    Julie's Cuban is a cute place but don't go if you're expecting a great meal.  If you do want a fun night with some apps and Margeritas, it's a good option."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with Julie's. I order take out close to once a week; avocado salad and chicken dinner! The chicken is so tender and juicy it's to die for!!   I highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"Great food, went for an early dinner on a Friday night before it got busy.  An impressive selection of cocktails and hearty dishes to share, makes it a great spot for a date or friends to hang out in a relaxed atmosphere.  Cute spot surrounded by residential houses, it's a neat restaurant for sure. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Was there a week ago with some friends and it was just charming sitting outside under the beautifully lit trees. We had a few tapas like blue marlin ceviche guacamole, plantain,calamaris and some desserts also and do not forget the reason we stopped by after our 1rst dinner \"cocktails\" will definitely go back on my next visit to TO."}
{"text":"Everything here is freshly made, well prepared and the prices are reasonable.  Really friendly, helpful wait staff and a nice patio during the warm months all add to the experience (but watch out for the bees)."}
{"text":"Julie's snack bar opened in 1954 and used to be a convenience store of sort. She (Julie) eventually even started selling fresh made sandwiches. After Julie passed away, her daughter Syvlia took over. Her and her Cuban husband turned the place into a mini homestead Cuban restaurant.   The place is warm, inviting and ambient. The servers are unbelievably personable. Tucked in the residentials off the Ossington strip, it's a welcome little surprise for those who wander.   Now truth by told, i tried with every ounce in body to fall in love with this place - just the one thing missing the mark is the food. The prices are reasonable but can be questioned in terms of value on certain dishes like the drinks and desserts.  Overall, my opinion is that the small plates are the way to go. Some of the best yuca i've had in a long time was here. But if you meander into the mains, that's where the disappointment begins.   So in my opinion - if you're heading down to Julie's, expect a warm inviting, almost romantic atmosphere. Order a few drinks as opposed to cocktails and a few tapas style plates as oppose to mains. Then you'll have an amazing time and you'll get the charm of Julie's."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Julie's, but as the setting of this year's birthday dinner, she barely cut it. First off the bat, I arrived early to a full front dining room and was not greeted for a very long time. Standing there awkwardly amongst the tightly fitted tables of glowing diners while wondering what happened to my reservation for six, I looked toward the two busy servers in the back and smiled, only to be met with frazzled glances and not even a nod. Finally, a third lady came out from the kitchen and showed me to the slightly less atmospheric back room where there was a table all set up for us.   Between this lady who had an owner-like air and a scatterbrained male server, our overall service was hurried but in slow motion. Our drinks were delivered to the wrong table (when there were only two parties in the room), settings were taken away when I assured them that everyone was coming, dishes were delivered to the wrong people (without any attempts at confirmation), and the bill took ages to arrive.    As I had been fairly warned by fellow Yelpers, the considerably high prices are unjustified. (I had originally justified them by comparing them with the prices of the menus on Ossington - where all the restaurants had already been fully booked.) It's all true though: the quality and care in preparation is not on the same level. The mojitos were refreshingly not too sweet, but was chock full of ice. We weren't quite sure what to make of the big show that was made of the litre of sangria being transferred from one jug to another as part of the presentation. Why wasn't it just brought in that second jug? Maybe this process aerates the wine, but we may never find out.  The shrimp with spicy tomato sauce on rice that a couple of us got was reported to be okay, not spectacular. The tapas that the rest of us shared were similarly underwhelming. The ceviche was far too limey. The daily special of taro and sweet potato fritters were over cooked and didn't have even a hint of sweetness that one would expect from that combination. The artichoke heart salad was as fine as canned artichokes on a bed of lettuce could be.   I absolutely adore the look and idea of Julie's, but that will only get me through their doors once."}
{"text":"Try the platano especial; pretty much a spicy beef banana split. Nice servers and very friendly bartender. if you want a dangerously easy to drink cocktail, try the stormy weather. For ginger lovers only."}
{"text":"We were in a rush, and they pulled off the most magical thing - speeding us along without dinner feeling rushed. Food was tasty, especially liked the hint of lime in the black bean soup (more than a hint, really), and the plantain cups filled with avocado were divine."}
{"text":"Have to agree with the other reviews regarding pricing.  Should know better then to get seated at a restaurant before reading Yelp reviews.  Food was good and the ambiance did make me want to move to Cuba!  but the prices as just too high.  Wouldn't go back.  All in all I was glad I tried it though.  If the prices were lower I would be a regular."}
{"text":"This place has 4 star potential but what really ruined it for me was the pricing! WTF?  Some of the other reviews are SPOT ON in mentioning that the price point is too high. The food is tasty, but it's pretty simple and somewhat bland. They are charging too much for the food.  I don't mind paying good money for fine dining, but not for what they are serving. It was like paying $12.99 for a McDonalds happy meal.   They do have a \"quaint\" little patio with plastic chairs and Christmas lights. Service was good.  My friend and I shared a salad and 3 appetizers. Drank water. It came to $46 including tip, yikes!   And the drinks...$9.50 for a mojito? Really? Aye, carumba!  The food here is overly greasy too. Our corn fritters were basically just deep fried pieces of gloopy batter. The fried plaintain was more oily than I've ever seen it prepared, even in Cuba. Avocado & mango salad was decent. Ceviche was OK but really plain and chopped into really big lazy pieces.  Anyway, next time I want to drop that much money, I'll go somewhere schmancy fancy!  Lower your prices please, Julie."}
{"text":"Julie's Cuban Restaurant is a place you could totally miss. We've been by it so many times and never saw it until my cousin invited me to join her family for dinner. I don't really understand Cuban food (even after having visited Cuba) but I imagine it's hard to do \"fancy\" Cuban and thankfully Julie's doesn't try. It's a very nice and homey feel and I think a lot of their dishes would serve better family style instead of a la carte.  We were a large group and got almost all of their mains. I got the Bistec Empanizado which I thought was pretty good. The serving is just way too big for one meal, but that means yummy left overs. At first the piece of beef looks quite bland but biting into it you know a lot of flavour has been introduced to it by way of breading. The Bistec de Palomilla is similar without the breading but with onions instead. My guy found his piece of steak to be a little tough in spots. We ordered some appetizers which were just okay, can't remember too much about them.  We ordered Tortilla Chips con Guacamole while we waited for a few stragglers to arrive. I thought it would be fresh chips, but when I went to the washroom I got a good look in the kitchen and unfortunately it was a bag of Tostitos. Yeah, kind of disappointing. I didn't find any pineapple in the guacamole, which would make it authentically Cuban. Another disappointment.  To drink we ordered the Sangria - just okay, Mojito Cubano - yum! and a  piña colada - made fresh and was so very delicious. Someone also ordered the 15 year Glenfiddich which was a complete UNDER POUR considering the price. The quantity was laughable.  We also ordered desserts but they weren't memorable and I just remember thinking \"way too sweet\" so I'd skip dessert and opt for the piña colada instead ;)  Overall it was nice to try something new in a place that could accommodate my large family and still give us friendly and unhurried service. There were a few things that need to be improved. I'd suggest they remove guacamole and chips off their menu. The mains are quite large so you don't really need to get an appetizer. And instead of dessert try their  piña colada!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars! Julie's is a beautifully decorated spot hidden on a residential street off Ossington. With help from the friendly and attentive waitstaff, I immediately fell in love with the ambience, and was ready to order almost anything and everything on the menu!  Fortunately I visited the restaurant with a small group, so we were able to order quite a variety of items. Alas, as has been mentioned in other reviews, we quickly noticed the price:food ratio is not really justified, and indeed the 1-2 slices of plantain that accompany the main dishes are more of a garnish than a side dish!  That being said, the Ceviche was excellent, and the papa rellena and plantains were excellent too!  The Ropa Vieja was a good choice. The beef was quite tender and juicy, though once again the overall portions were surprisingly small. Somebody mentioned Cafe Habana in New York and I must say the same meal would be half the price, with twice the portion at the popular spot!  Overall, I think the message is clear! Julie's makes fine tasting, pretty authentic Cuban, but they can do with bigger portions and tapas that can actually be shared for that price.  A good date spot!"}
{"text":"Restaurants in residential neighborhoods are always interesting. Stumbled across this one while parking on a side street was def a lucky strike. The place, a very Cubanish looking shack on a beach, with a vintage car parked out front, looked empty. Taking a stroll through the small patio, we noticed all tables were reserved and that's when we knew it was a neighborhood fav. Waitress was pleasant and gave us a table without reservation. Papa rellena was extreme goodness that resembled much of a  shepherds pie in a ball. The chorizes(spicy Spanish sausage) was a delightful app perfect on a mild august afternoon. Topping it off we had a hemmingway cocktail & Cuban margarita. If there is a next time, will def indulge in the entrees. Good for casual and intimate get togethers  The downside, food and drink prices were rediculously high. If you're going to charge $9-12 for alcoholic cocktails you have to put a resonable amount of alcohol in them."}
{"text":"I almost walked passed Julie's Cuban Restaurant ...as it just look like another house in this residential area... or it kind of look like a convenience store??   Nice, dark and dim... decorated with Christmas night and tons of Cuban's memorabilia of its glorious era.   The waiters here are some of the most friendliest and knowledgeable ones I have encountered.. and yes Cuban people does have the heart of gold!   Chips con Guacamole tasted awesome. One of the best I have in Toronto... Freshly homemade and with a great spicy kick!   The other items we order are just so so... Cerviche was a little disappointing because it either sour/limey enough and the fish texture is quite funny. Enchilado de Camarones was overpriced with that just 4 shrimps and didn't taste spectacular!   I think Julie's Cuban Restaurant is good place to share some apps and chill with your friends.. but if you going to have a full meal with drinks it does get quite pricey... and you wondering if it really worth it!"}
{"text":"It's a bad sign when the highlight of your visit is the kick-ass parking spot you snagged right out front.  Julie's is one of those residental chameleons, tucked away at the corner of Foxley and Dovercourt. You might even miss it as you walk by, it blends into the neighbourhood so well. There is a concrete patio out front with plastic furniture and umbrellas that is perfect for a summer night. I only glanced inside for a moment, but it seemed to be a dim and cozy space, decorated with shelves of bric-a-brac and a red-and-white checkered theme. Fortunately, there was room to dine on the patio, which was illuminated by candles and Christmas lights, i.e., bring a date here.  Their laminated one-pager is one-side drinks, one-side dinner. Noting that the bulk of the menu's real estate was dominated by tapas options, my date and I took a hint and ordered four dishes to share: chorizo sausage in red wine, postones rellenes (plantain \"cups\" filled with avocado salsa), papa rellena (a potato puff filled with beef), and just for the hell of it, coconut shrimp. The server recommended a fifth order to make sure we were full, so we tacked on one of the specials: a beef empanada plate.   The food was disappointing. The chorizo lacked the expected spicy smokiness; the potato puff was really low on filling and flavour; the coconut shrimp was OK -- but just OK -- and that's more Thai than Cuban, no? The real killjoy for me was the postones rellenes. Really dry and bland. The avocado salsa was not enough to save it and we left two out of four uneaten. I wish I had just ordered fried plantains. Why didn't this food have any flavour?  I don't want to tear this place apart. The restaurant itself seems charming, and the service was friendly. But as mentioned a few times, Julie's has a higher price point than most Latin American eats in this city, and the food really doesn't deliver at that level. I wish I could say I would return for drinks on their stellar patio, but at almost $10 for a watery mojito, I probably won't.   Obligatory Title Pun: This CUBAN's missed the MARK.  Menu Readability: Pretty clear and simple. And you can't go wrong with canary.  Need to mention: They serve Coke in tiny bottles. Yay.  What this place teaches me about myself: When I hear Cuban I think 'flavourful'! And 'Mark'! Am I wrong?"}
{"text":"Julie's can easily be confused for a craptastic corner store at first glance if the patio isn't set. Fortunately for Toronto, it's actually a quaint 6 table restaurant with lots of flavor and an extensive cocktail list.   When I think of Cuban food I think of the bland crud one gets at an all-inclusive resort. This is not even close to reality. Real Cuban food has spice, and has a lot of ground meats, plantains, hot sauce and fresh peppers. I tried it all here, like, one of everything with friends, and really enjoyed most of it. I'm not a plantain person*, but other people were into those dishes. Their guac is fresh, their chips are warm, their fritters are heavenly and the quesadilla-like-things are cheesy with a kick. The servers are delightful and make mean martinis, decent dark and stormys and a-ok caesars.   A delightful night was had by myself, Matt M and Michael N. In a funny coincidence a friend lives upstairs and has a small orange kitten. The servers knew the kitten and asked me what it's name was. I said Evelyn. This really made my night. (I don't really know the cat's name.)   PEPPER POINTS: For those addictive corn fritters. They're as good as everyone says they are. Get them, and slather on the sour cream.  *Cooked small bananas? Gross, Cuba. Gross."}
