{"text":"I went to a new restaurant in Whitby today for lunch. It's open for both breakfast and lunch. . I had a look at the breakfast menu and if you like Eggs Benedict give it a try.  The chef showed me a unique trick in making the perfect poached egg.  So I highly recommend. . But I was there for lunch.  I had a craving for a burger but this place is known for its smokehouse.  But I got lucky cause their burger was a smokehouse burger.  Handmade onion rings and fries were both as I like them. . I had no trouble finishing both.  As I was waiting for the burger I notice the window in the front was completely open allow I nice breeze into the Smokehouse.  The burger was juicy almost medium rare like with a hint of the smokiness.  It was delightful.  Next time it's smoked ribs or pulled pork. . Not sure what the favorite will be but I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Another Whitby restaurant failure.  Why do people go into this business with clearly no experience.  Waited over 45 minutes for an extremely mediocre breakfast.  Here is the rundown: 1.) asked for eggs over medium and poached eggs medium for my wife....both came out runny 2.) Asked for white toast...I received warm, limp white bread - not toasted. 3.) Breakfast comes with beans (which were the best part of the meal) except that you get a thimble-full. 4.) Three measly pieces of bacon, one which was rock hard.  5.) My wife had eggs benedict...from the minute the plate was put down, I could tell the hollandaise sauce was \"broken\", meaning it was not stirred and kept at the correct temperature - something that should be a basic skill for any cook.

If you can't even get breakfast right - give it up guys.  I will be surprised if they are still open by year-end..."}
{"text":"While I never wanted to write a bad review (we just vote with our feet and never return), my wife and I dearly wanted to have a good experience at the Boomerang. The old South side  Grill was a Whitby institution and for good reason. Boomerang fails from start to finish. While part of me wants the owner to read this and fix it, I fear they will not last. We were seated right away and given two menus at 11 am on a Sunday, we waited a good 15 minutes to get some coffee and attention. This gave us time to watch a very inexperienced chef (male) stumble and bumble around the exposed open kitchen. Once we did order simple eggs with rye toast, we waited 40 minutes in a diner that had less than 8 people. Rye toast was the two tiny end pieces that might make 1/2 a slice at best. 
The eggs were cold, which was of little surprise as we watched them sit on the kitchen counter while chef waited to burn the \"taters\" or whatever these poor substitues for home fries were. Made we crave the old south side real home fries that involved work and love. 
I figured using the name \"Smokehouse\" on everything on the menu, that the beans that accompanied would be okay . Nope...Canned beans for sure, but colder and less flavor.
So way more money than the old south side and not worth even trying again. 
Some advise, because I dearly would love a good breakfast place in Whitby: South Side always had lots of bacon , Ham and sausage on the grill and would add eggs cooked to perfection in minutes. Never waited more than 6 minutes on crowded days for a good hot breakfast
2) Keep it simple
3) tell the staff to focus on customers at tables and not socialize
4)  loose the canned beans"}
{"text":"Worst meal ever. All three of us received cold, over priced food. Eggs were over cooked. Fruit substitution for $2.00 can in a ramekin the size of a tablespoon. Owner/cook told us he had to leave for a huh and the waitress was making our food? Sausages tasted spoiled. And best of all good took over an hour to arrive- at a breakfast joint. All we got was a 50% discount. Insane."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the pleasure to have breakfast and lunch at Boomerang Grill Whitby. Little than we knew, we were pleasantly surprised about the tastefulness of the food. We realized that the ingredients were selected with care and the chef is remarkable in combining spices and ingredients together. Hence, why we are coming back for more. Everything is homemade and well crafted. The meat is smoked for at least 18 hours and my husband cannot get enough of the ribs. No more RIBFEST for us as we found our everyday RIBFEST. I recommend the chef to go compete at Top Chef Canada because her attention to details and spice selection are outstanding. Try it at least once and thank me later! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Boomerang is the best grill in Whitby.  I always go there when I'm working in the area and my buddies rave about it as well.   The big breakfast special is bettet than anywhere else because you get amazing home fries and homemade beans! But the omelette that has pulled pork is by far the best omelette you'll ever have.  Staff are great, atmosphere is clean and cozy.  Definitely one of my favorite places and I highly recommend you try it out."}
{"text":"One of the best eggs Benedict with pulled pork I have had so far. 
Service was great and the server was very friendly and pleasant.
She ensured everything was good and checked in with us a few times to ask how everything was."}
