{"text":"Well, that was uninspiring.   I go by this place all the time, and it's usually pretty dead. Tempted to try, but wary nonetheless.   I guess now I know better.   The $7.95 lunch box included my choice of entree along with rice and mixed veg. Also wonton soup or spring roll. 99 cents extra to get both.   Whatever. The veggies and cashew chicken were both coated in the same clear, flavourless sauce. Really, quite identical in their blandness, other than the components.   The clear sauce also did little to hide the pasty-white chicken chunks.   The rice was rice. Soup was kinda salty, and the teaspoon they included was tiny enough that a \"large\" takeout wonton would take an eternity to eat with it. Literally, you'd need to forego the spoon and chug the container if you preferred your soup hot.   It might be time for a complete makeover here, I'm afraid."}
{"text":"Where do I start.  I have ordered take out from this place many times.  Cannot have onion or green peppers.  So when some of my orders have come they have had onions and green peppers, so I would call and let them know, they would bring another dish over.  I asked everytime if they wanted the dish with the green peppers in it.  Her reply was, \"NO\".  So then I ordered food on October 31, 2011.  When looking at my cc statement I was surprised to see $56.00 from Pearl Fantasy.  I called to explain to her the problem and my worry.  When I called her to ask about this problem, she stated that she was busy and would get back to me.  She gave me a credit.  So I thought okay, another chance.  When I called Friday November 25 to place an order she stated that she was only giving me a credit of $6.00.    I stated that I wanted to see the reciept that I had alledgelly signed for $56.00, she told me to come in one hour, after her saying she did not want my business anymore and hanging up, i called back and told her I was on my way to look at my reciept.  When I go there she was NOT busy at all, no customers in the place.  So I waited for 45 minutes only to be told again that she was busy.  She would not even go look for the reciept.  Instead she stated that she new my pattern.  I am like what pattern.  She told me that I like free food.  i am like listen here lady, if I am paying for something and not getting what I pay for then YES I will complain.  She was totally unprofessional.    I would recommend that no one come here to eat.  If you oder out from here, be sure to look at your cc statement.  I have called the BBB as well as my cc company.  If she is holding back on showing the receipt something is wrong.  Stay away from this place, there are many place better then Pearl Fantasy."}
{"text":"Whether you enjoy bubble tea or not is besides the point...  the lady working at this place was extremely unprofessional. While we were there waiting quite a while for our beverages, there was another table of customers waiting for take out food. When their order was ready, they went up to the till to pay and had a disagreement with lady working there. I think it was over the price that they were getting charged because the eat-in price was different (cheaper) than the take-out price or something like that. In any case, the lady working there was confrontational. Not only that, she grabbed the bag of take out and placed it away from the customer (to show she didn't want to sell it to them if they were going to be that way). So the customers just walked out and left. I was shocked, but she followed the customers out and went after them still yelling at them.  I forgot to mention this was around 9:30 pm and there was no one else in the place except for us waiting for our drinks.  I don't know what logic that lady working there had... has she never heard of  \" the customer is always right\"... even if not \"always\"...  it's not like the customers weren't willing to pay.. i think it's kind of crazy that this place would charge a premium for take-out.. isn't is usually cheaper to get take-out?!? that's besides the point... the food had already been prepared and packaged.. why not make the sale, keep the customers happy.. even if you make a few less bucks.. instead of losing the sale altogether and having your other customers (my friends and I) witness this kind of outburst.  the beverages were nothing to write home about either... they ran out of most things such as lychee jelly... and they had very limited selection of what was available.. i had a mango slushee...  that tasted rather bland.. i seriously could have made that at home myself..   This was my first AND MY LAST time going to this place. I won't give my business to such unprofessional people. If I was able to give 0 stars to a place, this would be the place that deserves it! This is my first time witnessing someone go after a customer like that."}
{"text":"Let me just start off my saying that I have developed a secret (okay, well not so secret anymore) obsession with bubble tea. Seriously, in a perfect world I would have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner, 7 days a week.  This having been said, I was super hyped when I got off the C-Train and saw Pearl Fantasy beckoning my name.   When I went in, I noticed that no one else was in the restaurant, but was happy to be greeted by 2 friendly women with smiles. I thought everything was going to be all-smiles that day, but that was BEFORE I received my bubble tea.  It ended up being a GIGANTIC cup of mostly just ice-water. It had very little flavour and hardly any 'bubbles', so you can imagine my disappointment.  You know what the worst part ist? It's that I already have a place in the city that is my favourite bubble-tea place (see my reviews on Bubblicious and Thai Thi) but I convinced myself to try somewhere new because maybe, just MAYBE their bubble tea COULD be better...well no cigar. It was the furthest thing from better and I should have just stuck with what I knew.  Lesson Learned."}
