{"text":"What a great surprise this restaurant was! Go to Sonoran Salon monthly, but hadn't given the Grotto Cafe a try for anything more than ice tea & great lattes. Today went for lunch with husband and throughly enjoyed our yummy grilled sandwiches. Welcomed and encouraged back to try breakfast by a gracious manager. Yes, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot in Cavecreek for breakfast and lunch. Their patio is wonderful to sit at when the weathers nice. Sandwiches, salads, tacos French toast everything is wonderful! Definitely a must hit."}
{"text":"The Grotto is a great place for a quiet study place or a social sit down with some friends. All the staff is very friendly, bright, and helpful. They have GREAT breakfast opinions that are ALL ABSOLUTELY deliciously satisfying! Personally my favorite is their coffee, which is savory and made exactly the way you want it!"}
{"text":"We love this place  and come here almost every weekend as long as we have nice weather. Our dogs love it too!  Met a lot of nice people as well."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Sandwiches are yummy and huge! Good variety of salads with or without protein. Keep in mind that they are large portions and easily shareable. You usually have to wait in line to order but it seems to move pretty quickly. Staff has always been friendly and service is fast despite the crowd. There's seating room inside but sitting outdoors in the grotto area is really nice. When you're done eating you can wander through the Red Truck consignment store. We always make a point to have  lunch here when in town."}
{"text":"Local, not a chain, that's what I look for. Never disappointed at the Grotto Cafe.  Food is delicious and service is fast and friendly.  Nice atmosphere. Great patio.  Fortunately inside is air conditioned! So glad they are close by. Have brought friends and they love it, too.  Try it, bet you love it, too."}
{"text":"Yummy bruschetta, great entertainment, welcoming staff and good service"}
{"text":"I took 2 girlfriends from out of town here for breakfast today and  it was great! The outdoor ambience is delightful and we were all very pleased with our food. Manager Curtis went out of his way to make our experience extremely pleasant. I highly recommend this restaurant and it will continue to be one of my \"go to\" Cave  Creek favorites!!!"}
{"text":"Went back to the Grotto on Friday night; perfect snacks and well priced wine.  Good music, great owners..."}
{"text":"A favorite in my family. Great place to enjoy sunday brunch or just a cup of coffee. Only complaint is in the last year we are noticing changes in portions (coffee mugs a lot smaller for example)."}
{"text":"Have had a great Southwest salad here before (highly recommend) and a yummy gazpacho. The atmosphere is great. Made the mistake of ordering the veggie panini today and I now cannot believe I paid $10 for this. Hardly anything on it, just thick bread, but what is on it is overly salty and greasy mushrooms, a little spinach and hardly a roasted pepper in sight. You want to charge $10 for this? Then you might think about adding some pesto and losing the grease. I had to add my own avocado to even eat it. Did I mention salty? If you read this please consider putting some love into crafting a REAL veggie sandwich for your menu, then I will return again and again.."}
{"text":"great coffeeeeeeeee. great service. very fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"Gorgeous outdoor patio, and yummy breakfast food.  Coffee is great too!"}
{"text":"My 100 year old mom and I stopped here for breakfast. In her words, great food, nice and courteous people, clean restrooms.  She gave it an A. I thought it was great place. Sort of a hippie atmosphere. Relaxed, great food, friendly servers.  Good place to eat, read, work on your computer, hang out. Great atmosphere, music, couch, really interesting signs on the walls. Looks like it appeals to a wide range of people.  Might up there again just to eat.   Paul and lila"}
{"text":"A friend and I met for lunch today, our first time eating at The Grotto Cafe.  Needless to say, we will not be back.  I ordered a turkey sandwich without mayo and I think that meant to them light on the turkey.  I received a plate full of potato chips, a pickle and 3 slices of turkey (the size of a post it sticky note) 1 slice of bacon and the smallest piece of avocado - I almost missed it. However, I did get what I asked for \"No Mayo\". The baguette bread, besides the chips was the biggest thing on my plate.  The ice tea tasted very old and I asked for a diet coke instead. I left everything on my plate expect for the 3 post it note sizes of turkey, 1 piece of bacon and that very small piece of avocado.    For a cost of $12.50 plus tip.  NOT WORTH IT!!  My friend's salad was a joke as well.  I am not sure who rates the value of the menu, but they really need to see what is being served.  I would say it is $$ but NOT WORTH IT!!"}
{"text":"The grotto is famous to the local scene in cave creek as it sits at the base of the jaw dropping beauty of black mountain (best atmosphere award). This is the spot to go to be around people and have fantastic coffee, beer, wine, sandwich or salad. A very busy spot but don't worry because it's the fastest counter service in the west. I'm usually helped by Matt at the counter, who is of genius Witt with quick jokes and fast service (perfect way to get the day started). Owner, Kurt is without a doubt the friendliest business owner out there. He'll help you get whatever you need without making you feel guilty. All around great vibe with great regulars at this spot"}
{"text":"Everyone there is so friendly and welcoming. The tuna sandwich is by far the best sandwich. Their BLTA sandwich comes in at a close second...you really can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches. I always say I'm going to try something different like their salads the next time I go, but I cannot leave without a sandwich."}
{"text":"Service was very quick. Enjoyed the outdoor courtyard for eating the Delicious soup and sandwich outside."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It has good food, good vibes and the smoothies and coffee are out of this world."}
{"text":"Love this place! The coffee is really good, the sandwiches are amazing and the staff - especially Lindsay - are the best. I would definitely recommend this place. The decor inside is really fun too- check it out!"}
{"text":"Best Organic Coffee House Agave Stevia Price Architecture Friendliness Family Run in Cave Creek !"}
{"text":"Love this place! Dog friendly patio, great simple food, lovely lattes. The service can be a tad forgetful but always pleasant."}
{"text":"I love the endless iced coffee refills! I have been there twice now. Once to relax and read in their sitting area, and this week we went for lunch. We shared a turkey panini sandwich, and a southwest salad with jicama. It was delicious! It was a great experience, and a nice change from the cowboy or western theme that you would expect in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Impressive outdoor dining area greets you as you walk in.  But the magic stops there.  The coffee was acceptable but not much better than gas station quality brew.    Our drink order was completely messed up and nobody seemed to care.  All egg dishes are cooked with a microwave.  Completely unacceptable unless you've got the Golden Arches out front.  The worm in our side bowl of fruit was the icing on the cake.   Based on the owners's response, I will try this place again.  Maybe it was a fluke.  I will report back shortly."}
{"text":"Fun spot for coffee, breakfast and lunch. I especially enjoy sitting outdoors in the garden area. The owners and staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch based on reviews as we were passing through town.  I ordered the chicken enchilada soup which was delicious and the shrimp ceviche.  Since the shrimp ceviche was $9.99,  I expected a bowl of shrimp that had been marinated in citrus.  Instead I got a bowl of salsa with 4 shrimp in it.  While the salsa was tasty it wasn't worth the price.  If that is the way they want to serve it they should give you a side of tortilla chips instead of saltine packages.  My husband ordered a Club.  It was good and the bread was delicious.  Nice atmosphere. We ate outside and enjoyed the lovely AZ weather."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service even better. As long as you don't mind stepping over people's dogs."}
{"text":"I always enjoy my visits here. Genuinely friendly staff, who cares about the quality of their coffee and food."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot in Cave Creek!  Love the chicken salad sandwich on toasted cranberry nut break.   Their salads are great.  Everything is fresh.   It's always busy but the staff is friendly & efficient!!"}
{"text":"The setting, atmosphere and staff are what makes this place great.  The food I tried was OK.  the fruit was fresh and ripe.  the patio is great when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"My daughter and I go out for a weekly breakfast together and she always chooses the restaurant. This week she chose the Grotto CafÈ.  We've lived in Cave Creek for a few years now and somehow this gem escaped us until we walked in the front door.  The shopping center where the café is located is beautiful and the landscaping is gorgeous.  One of the first things we noticed was how friendly, warm and happy the entire team was. We both ordered the Red Truck Burrito and orange juice. This is the type of restaurant where you order your meal at the counter, go find a table and the team will bring you your meals.   My one criticism about the restaurant was that a few of the tables needed to be cleaned and there were a few seats that were very uncomfortable to sit in. If it wasn't for this, I would've given this restaurant a five star rating.  The burritos were amazing; everything tasted fresh and the flavor profile was incredible. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Chicken Salad Sandwich EVER!!!!! And the Breakfast Bowls are amazing. Beautiful patio, or sit inside and buy the furniture! Service can be frustrating, as there's only one person to take the orders, so you may be in line a while, even for a coffee."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have gotten lunch here a few times!  The salads and sandwiches are very yummy!  Love the outdoor seating as well.  Set back from Cave Creek road, makes for a pleasurable dining experience.  Grab a table outside towards the back and enjoy the Black Mountain backdrop!  They're also dog friendly so that makes this place rock even more!"}
{"text":"Salads are really good! Everything was fresh and tasty. The ambiance is excellent with a shaded patio for outdoor seating. A great place to grub after hiking Black Mountain as it's easy walking distance to the trailhead."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in town hands down. Been here over a dozen times and not once was I disappointed. Best part about a good joint for for is consistency and great quality consistency is exactly what you get. Definitely with the trip."}
{"text":"If you are visiting Cave Creek, the Grotto Cafe is the perfect place for coffee, breakfast and/or lunch.  It is comfortable, casual, the staff are friendly and food is wonderful.  Be sure to try the Baja chicken soup - salads are great as well.  Just wish they were open for dinner.  Indoor and outdoor (dogs welcome) eating"}
{"text":"They serve the best value Latte's not only in Cave Creek but I would suggest in the North Scottsdale/Phoenix locale. The food is pretty good as well, not quiet Home Cooking quality but with a little more effort and real eggs - who knows..  Well worth the visit, go on, try it, you will be amazed at the wall art and their background music is excellent  Look for the \"Red Truck\" parked just off Cave Creek Rd and head on in...."}
{"text":"I love this place! Cozy and friendly... delicious ceviche and loved the gluten free bread i was able to substitute on my sandwich! Great light lunch option in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Great food, service & atmosphere. The Red Truck Burrito with chorizo (& I added avocado) was super tasty. Latte was made as I wished.  Love the patio."}
{"text":"Amazing ROC2 coffee and great breakfast selections while in the most awesome hidden gem in all of AZ. Smoothies, sandwiches, salads, and beer too!"}
{"text":"So, apparently I have over 40 Check-in's here (of the times I remembered to check in) so it can be legitimately assumed I like this place. OK, it's probably my favorite spot to go for a morning coffee and a bite to eat as I read whatever book I'm involved in at the time. I first discovered Grotto Cafe on one of my road cycling outings with a friend, we'd paused mid-ride for coffee.   The courtyard is just a phenomenal little spot to relax and enjoy. Lately it's been more of a breakfast run on the motorcycle (I've gotten a bit lazy in that regard, lol, but that's another story). I'm an early riser so the Grotto is just an ideal, peaceful spot to start the day, usually on a day off from work. Whether I sit in that serene courtyard or eat inside, it's always a great spot.  Though I have to admit, I'm not a great fan of the country music that always seems to be playing...;  But the staff is ALWAYS friendly, smiling and helpful and you can tell they enjoy interacting with their customers.   My typical fare is an Americano ( recommended! ) or a latte to go along with the Red Truck Sandwich on toasted Everything bagel with bacon. Like most of the breakfast items it comes with an awesome little bowl of fresh fruit, usually cantaloupe, raspberry and blueberry or blackberry. The Red Truck burrito is also a winner, as is the Grotto Bagel: an open bagel topped with bacon, tomato & cream cheese. The oatmeal is also pretty darned tasty. I've only been there once for lunch; I had the Meatball Marinara sandwich, also quite good.   The Grotto Cafe just ticks of so many little boxes for me. It's a peaceful little sanctuary where I can enjoy a quiet morning reading and drinking coffee for an hour or so. The decor is nice and eclectic with vintage prints and LP's adorning the wall, cozy tables and chairs, while outside you can relax listening to the gentle trickle of water and birds. Great place."}
{"text":"We had breakfast there as out-of-towners. I would say the food was average. The egg was dry and the burrito bowl did not come with any salsa or sauces. So it felt dry! However, the coffee was excellent and the service was good."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere serving up amazing coffee and a delicious lox bagel!  If we are ever near Cave Creek will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Mijn favoriete plek in Cave Creek. het ligt een beetje achteraf, dus ik ben er wel een paar keer voorbij gereden maar omdat het echt de moeite waard is kom ik er graag. het is een groot cafe met verschillende plekken, je kunt er binnen zitten en kiezen uit drie ruimtes en ook buiten heb je gevarieerde keuzes. Het eten is bijzonder lekker en de koffie is uitstekend."}
{"text":"Great food service and atmosphere.Very generous portions. Friendly people.Very hard working owner. Staff is awesome. Great place to eat and hangout."}
{"text":"Very nice place, lots of seating in and outdoors. Seems to always be busy probably because of the ambiance of the outside seating. Lots of people equals a good business, but wouldn't mind if there were a few less people to savior my cappuccino. :-)"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? The sandwiches use to be awesome.  I ordered a Egg salad sandwich, cup of Chicken Baja soup, small soda water. $18.00 ??? for lunch. WOW Egg salad was sparse. bread was very thick and a mountain of potato chips and no chicken in the soup."}
{"text":"Very unique cafe. Had the pressed flat bread grilled cheese with bacon. Two thumbs up! Nice selection of beer and wines. Inside air conditioned seating with a lot of movie and music memorabilia on the walls as well as a large outdoor seating area with lots of shade. Tables, in and out are spread out so your not right on top of other diners. The owners Curtis and mike came over and not just checked on us, but struck up a convo telling the history of their place and made us feel very welcome. Highly recommend and we will return."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a delicious mango smoothie and chicken salad sandwich. Everything was delicious and fresh. The indoor cafe is spacious with some pretty cool funky decor and the outside was very pleasant.   Customer service was great and I would definitely come back for their food."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches and great service and atmosphere.  Perfect indoor or outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place with my husband and son - what a find!!! Loved the ambiance to start with - such a unique place with a patio that is perfect if you are dining with dogs! I had the iced tea (best I have ever had at a restaurant) and my son and husband had the Arnold Palmer - also delicious!. I had the southwestern salad - not only was it beautifully presented, but it tasted fabulous! My son and husband had the roast beef sandwich which they raved about! We will be going back to try breakfast! Service was friendly and our food was brought to the table not long after we settled in to enjoy our beverages."}
{"text":"Killer coffee and great food options. Fun people and a wonderful atmosphere. Get there early to avoid the crowd!"}
{"text":"Food came out fast.  Cute relaxing patio. Breakfast bowl was ok. My friend got the breakfast sandwich and it looked better.  Good juice and muffins too."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places! I love coming here for lunch and sitting outside in the patio area. The sandwiches are delicious, I especially recommend the grilled cheese with added bacon! The Grotto cafe has a great atmosphere, friendly staff and great food with very reasonable prices. I always recommend friends to come here for lunch or breakfast :) They have live music now too on weekends and I am very looking forward to it, I'm sure I won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ventured here for some Sunday brunch. While a little busy, still found a place to sit easily. I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo and my husband had the grilled cheese with bacon. The burritos eggs were nice and fluffy, chorizo cooked perfectly and potatoes were good. Even came with a side of house made salsa verde with avocado in it, really tasty, and a side of seasonal fruit. The best part is their bottomless drink section which included my favorite iced coffee. Had alcohol and espresso drinks as well. Cute shaded patio areas all throughout. Not dog friendly patio due to health code according to a sign I read. Staff was friendly and laid back vibe with bob Marley playing softly in the background."}
{"text":"One of the better basic breakfast burritos I have had recently. Despite the $8.99 pricetag, it just had that great taste and ingredients that made it worthy of the price. The eggs were very fluffy, the bacon was crisp and the potatoes were cut and cooked right. I like the avocado salsa served on the side as well. Coffee was very good and the smoothie received a solid review as well. Also a great patio to enjoy your food. A very relaxing and tasty breakfast."}
{"text":"The girl behind the counter kept scratching herself and rubbing her face. Tried not to think about it while eating. The food was good."}
{"text":"Only had time to get a coffee, and it was darn good. Got an almond milk mocha after hiking Black Mountain. This place was incredible. Looks like they opened fairly recently and are doing a really great job. The food smelled fantastic and the venue was ridiculous! It went on and on with several rooms, conference rooms and outdoor seating. It's a well-known place with the locals and the ginormous Great Dane- Diva is the mascot. Like I said, I can't wait to go back and eat!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. I had the breakfast burrito and my girlfriend and son split one. Very filling and decent prices. They had bacon in theirs while mine had the chicken sausage. Comes with a side of fruit (strawberries, blueberries, and mango)-very fresh. We ate outside in the courtyard which is very cool, inside looks good too and is deceiving huge inside so you will not be cramped. Plenty of small tables as well as larger five person or more sized tables. Ample parking on the side as well as in the back. Other shops are right in the same area as well. Definitely a place worth checking out while in the cave creek/carefree area. Just look for the old (but perfectly restored) red pickup truck and the cafe is towards the back."}
{"text":"Went here for an early morning coffee and I was not disappointed. The coffee was hot and delicious and the outdoor patio was just so serene. If I were a local, I'd be a daily regular."}
{"text":"I grew up in a Mexican household, eating Mexican food on a regular basis. However, I have never in my 38 years of life have eaten delicious carnitas tacos like the ones served at The Grotto Cafe. They were out of this world! They were seasoned perfectly and they were tender. And that sauce... Mmmmmm! I need to return and bring my entire family. Ricardo is one of the cooks who was kind enough to prepare the tacos during their breakfast hours. Thank you, Ricardo! The employees are courteous and the restaurant is very clean. Prices are reasonable. Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here based on someone else's recommendation, and we were not disappointed! So much so that we've been there three times in as many days. First of all, not very many casual cafes in the Valley have such a nice shaded patio with quite a bit of seating. But if you want to sit inside, they have plenty of tables to choose from in three different rooms (and a small, private meeting room), uniquely decorated with cool A/C. Either way, you order at the counter, and they will bring your food to you. The friendly owner, who is often walking around seeing how folks are doing, also owns a consignment store in the same plaza in three different suites, so it's worth browsing around when you're done eating. The rest of the staff is friendly, too. But I digress: Let's get to the food and drink! Well, it's really good, and there's a little something for everyone on the menu. The salads and sandwiches are excellent, and the portions aren't skimpy. We've tried the pulled pork sandwich and the Cobb salad. But the first thing we tried here was breakfast. I had the Red Truck Breakfast Burrito with scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, cheese, and chicken apple sausage (though you can choose other meats), and it was large and delicious. My wife had the Grotto Bowl (very similar ingredients without the potatoes and tortilla), and it was also delicious. And I can't go any further without mentioning the coffee. There are about five different drinks that are bottomless, and one of them is the 20-ounce iced cold brew from a local roastery for $2.49. Yes, that's right: a 20-ounce iced cold brew with free refills for that price. Who does that?! Amazing! On top of that, they have punch cards so that you can get a free drink once you fill the card up. We think the Grotto Café is a great little breakfast or lunch spot to visit with friends or to chill for awhile while reading a book. They have free wi-fi, so it's also a comfortable place to do a little work on the laptop...which I may just have to do soon, because I think that refillable cold brew is calling my name again. :o)"}
{"text":"I cannot understand why this place is rated so high. Portions are small, and the food was insanely bland. I had the breakfast bowl and a side of bacon. And my partner had the breakfast burrito. Neither had any flavor, including the strips of bacon. How do you ruin bacon? I don't get it. The staff is very friendly, and the dining room very well decorated and nice. But the food, omg!"}
{"text":"Darling place! While it was too late in the day for coffee (for me), I love that they serve organic coffee!  It seems difficult to find that. I had the carnitas tacos and they were delicious and satisfying.  Looking forward to trying this place again in the future."}
{"text":"So not only is the coffee here some of the best I have ever had (and a medium iced americano is only $2.50! very smooth and not bitter at all), the customer service here is incredible!!   we bought one of the berry scones and discovered that the center was still very undercooked.  I brought it back to the counter to exchange, and the young lady immediately apologized and got us a new one.  On our way out, we wanted to get a to-go refill on an iced tea, and she gave us two!  another employee apologized for the scone, and gave us a coupon for a free entree. we were so impressed with their hospitality and customer service.  they will go above and beyond to make sure you have a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant!!  Nestled in the heart of cave creek a breakfast/lunch oasis offering plenty of tasty offerings.  I had the meatball sandwich which was fantastic.  The bread was perfect!  They could improve by adding something to the plate other than chips.  Prices are very fair offering great value.  Parking is not a problem at least not when we went.  Saturday's are busy as you could imagine in a place that draws tourists.  Order at counter and they bring your order to you.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Perfect portion of fresh ingredients to a healthy choice for every visitors delight..."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches, salads and soup. Love this local establishment.  We enjoy the pulled pork and chicken salad sandwiches. Best around."}
{"text":"Great relaxing atmosphere to kickstart any day"}
{"text":"Had lunch today there for the first time.  Excellent food and great atmosphere!  My wife and step mother both had the chicken salad sandwich.  My wife liked the sandwich bread so much she bought a loaf from the restaurant!  It had cranberries and walnuts and was very tasty.  I had a turkey panini sandwich which also had cranberries in it and was very good as well.  Would definitely recommend this place for breakfast, lunch, or just some good atmosphere and a cup of coffee!"}
{"text":"This spot is my go-to place for a bite at breakfast/ lunchtime and/or a place to bring my computer to get work done when I need a change of scenery.   The food is consistently delicious- my current favorite item on the menu is the carnitas tacos. I had been getting either the BLTA or the turkey avocado sandwich, because I never associated this place with tacos, but I am SO glad I tried them!! They also make great coffee/espresso drinks, as well as a rich and tasty nitro brew if you are needing superhuman energy.   The staff is friendly and takes great care of their guests. The noise level is just right. All the times I have been here, the clientele has been an equal mix of families with kids, adults meeting friends for brunch/coffee, young adults, and people like myself who are catching up on work. The atmosphere is fun and unpretentious, with a wide variety of seating options whether it be a couch, a high top table or regular height dining. Everything is clean and comfortable. Power outlets are pretty well dispersed. When weather permits, their patio is lovely and the place to be! The setting as a while is really special, and a great place for locals to enjoy regularly, as well as a fun place to take out-of-town guests to enjoy a meal or coffee in beautiful, quirky little Cave Creek."}
{"text":"While menu maybe limited, food is flavorful. Hot food arrives hot. And that's a good sign. Staff is pleasant and efficient and aims to please. You'd be depriving yourself of a pleasant experience, if and when you're in the surrounding environs, if you don't stop in. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Very charming atmosphere. Acceptable salad when in a pinch, nothing special about it. The music is loud, so I've found it's just not the place to do my telecommuting work.  Don't buy the smoothies. What a sorry excuse for a smoothie. 6 bucks for ice and syrup?  Go for the coffee and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This cafe got off the ground 3-5 years ago.  It had a change in ownership I believe.  Since then, they have been going strong, and for a good reason.  Their coffee is VERY good, not to mention they have a large selection of various beverages (beer, wine, tea & smoothies) and quality food options.  The Grotto is a great place for breakfast & lunch.  They offer some fantastic menu items, some healthy, some not so healthy, but definitely a good balance of both.  Wi-Fi is free, so you are welcome to make it your \"comfort space\" if you have the option of working outside of your home.  For a more detailed look at the menu options, see their menu posted in the Yelp photo section of this business."}
{"text":"Out for a Saturday hike in Cave Creek, stopped into the Grotto Cafe for lunch, with two kids - ages 6 and 9 in tow. Just after we arrived, a bunch of people lined up behind us. I think this stressed out the woman taking our order, because she was really impatient and pressuring us to order quickly. We are far from a slow family, but hadn't really had a chance to look at the menu before ordering. With no kids menu, we requested a sandwich for them to split (they are quite large) with the fixins on the side (avo, lettuce, mayo, etc.).  I felt so pressured that I ended up not even ordering drinks for two of us and the other stuff we wanted (smoothie, and dessert of some kind).   The patio is quite nice, and they deliver the food to you. The guy dropped the food off and split - we had no silverware or napkins. None of the side fixins were included with the sandwich, so the kids ate dry turkey sandwiches. To Grotto's defense, I did go back in to get napkins (they were behind the counter, so we're supposed to reach back there and grab them?) and another server asked if we had everything. She apologized profusely when I said that none of the sides came with the sandwiches and offered to get us anything we needed. Problem was the kids were halfway through them, so it was kind of pointless to get the condiments at that point.  I had egg salad sandwich & hubby had BLT. They were pretty good. Nothing to write home about, but totally acceptable for a nice lunch.   Probably will visit again to see if our first drop in was just a bad moment for Grotto. The patio is so nice I would love to sit out there for breakfast & lunch with coffee and/or a beer and relax!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, good breakfast sandwich, and nice outside seating. Just what I was looking for."}
{"text":"Turkey avocado sandwich and strawberry feta salad were super tasty, but my friend's Cobb salad tasted as if it had been sitting for a while."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Customer service is above and beyond! Food is great and great coffee. I love all the unique wall hangings and the patio is beautiful to be when the weather is nice. I think I've tried every sandwich they serve and all DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"A solid average ... only because I loved how someone else's salad looked.  Had brunch ... breakfast burrito.  Small-ish ... very little of the sausage in it.  The fruit cup was a little \"aged\" - not bad .. but I had visions of the fruit having been chopped yesterday and sat in the fridge being sad all night.  Service was great.  Just not the 5 star experience I was expecting based on the reviews I had seen.   Perhaps lunch would have been a better choice than breakfast?"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in today for lunch.  Chicken salad sandwich for me, tuna salad sandwich for her.  Sandwiches were freshly prepared and the bread was incredible.  Prompt, friendly service.  Reasonable prices.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Truly love outdoor seating just like a grotto . The foods good not great nice place to go with a friend  to grab breakfast or lunch even just a coffee etc. I had a bloody Mary there if he's to good no extras what so ever nothing so not a no-frills bloody Mary I'll say no celery no olives no nothing just bloody Mary mix and vodka. Breakfast sandwich is just scrambled eggs with bacon and cheese already mixed on a bagel"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast , the staff does a great job and are very friendly.... Love the Lox & Bagel and you can't beat their prices"}
{"text":"What a great little spot. Had the carnitas tacos- and there were fantastic-do not miss them! Friendly service where employees clearly took a lot of pride in their business & food. Will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Had a breakfast burrito with chorrizo it was good. Also note that it was summer season I find off season food and service is not so good in the area. This was an exceptionally example of good food and service. Good place for my thrifty parents."}
{"text":"First time at Grotto's Cafe. Love the atmosphere as they have a collection of paintings and signs that decorate the walls of this overall western themed place.  They have indoor and outdoor seating. You will order at the front and they will bring you your meal. Being it was my first time, I asked the cashier for any recommendations and she gave me more than just 1 which I liked. I went with the Bowl with avocado and chicken sausage. It came fairly quick and it was a lot more filling then I would have thought. Not overly blown away by the food, but would come back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, quirky, interesting and addictive.  Each salad and sandwich I've had has made me want to go back for more and try different things from the menu."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday, in the dead of the summer, 105°, for lunch. As a consequence of the season, seemed like mostly locals were there for lunch, except for us tourists from Tempe, trying to get out of the heat (110°--there is a difference). There was a decent number of people there, but some open tables.   I had a chicken salad sandwich on cranberry/walnut bread, and switched out the potato chips for a cup of black beans. Good move - - the black beans with a bit of queso fresco on top were terrific. The sandwich was great, and even the dill pickle spear hit the mark.   My wife had the Monterey chicken salad with lime dressing and slabs of white chicken breast on top. Scrumptious. She had the black passion tea, and it worked. Well, it cooled her down. She took a second one to go.   We were impressed with the genuinely friendly counter girl who took our order, and the table server as well. My tip was already in the jar at the order counter so they weren't \"working for the tip.\" They seemed to actually enjoy working there, making our dining experience enjoyable.  And if you are nostalgic for Woodstock and all the famous counter-culture singers and bands since then, you will enjoy the decor. But if you are a young person, then the place will be a pictorial history for you.   There are a lot of eateries in Cave Creek, but they have some serious competition with the Grotto."}
{"text":"Only been here once. Decided to try it after tasting their food at the Taste of Cave Creek. I love chicken salad sandwiches and can never find a good one, well their is incredible. The chicken salad sandwich in an amazing collection of flavors in an outstanding bread. I have honesty never had a chicken salad sandwich that good. I may never be able to review any other good of theirs because I'm sure every time I go, and I will go often, I will get that heavenly sandwich. The service was friendly, the environment clean and inviting. Definitely a must if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Great local place for breakfast and lunch. Perfect portion sizes -- menu items are kind of breakfadt/lunxh standards with a slight (almost gourmet) twist."}
{"text":"I discovered a hidden gem and I almost (focus on the word almost) don't want to share my find! But, I will with my Yelp friends. During a morning of discovering new businesses, I decided to drive up to Cave Creek and work from a coffee shop in the area. I turned to my trustee Yelp app and noticed the Grotto's listing. Just then, I saw the sign and it looked like it was right up my alley so I decided to check it out!  This little coffee shops is filled with unique character. It's nestled off Cave Creek Road and trees hide it from plain site, but locals know just where to go! Inside, the walls are lined with different pictures and antiques and various tables and chairs fill the rooms. There's plenty of seating. My favorite area was the patio that felt like a little secret garden with several patio tables and chairs.   When I first walked in, I looked around and could tell that this is a local hot spot and it was obvious that I was not a regular patron. The staff is friendly and seemed to know all the regular's orders. I decided to order the egg sandwich on a bagel along with an iced mocha. I then headed outside to the patio and set up my computer for a morning of work. Did I mention I love the patio? It's filled with character from both the atmosphere and the regulars who hang out there. In the midst of working, I look over and a huge great dane is staring at me face to face! Yes, this patio is also dog-friendly!   While I enjoyed my delicious egg bagel sandwich and iced coffee, I worked using the free wi fi that the shop offers. It was a delightful morning and I will definitely be back to work from this adorable coffee shop in Cave Creek again in the future!"}
{"text":"Absolute garbage food. Our microwaved burrito with Jimmy Dean's potatoes and unmelted cheese  came out sooner than our lattes. The \"fresh fruit\" was at least 3 days old and the bowl it was served in was partially filled. I immediately asked for more fruit since we paid $9 for the plate. The lattes were good but I was so disappointed in their \"gourmet\" food we will never return. Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"A great little place in Cave Creek!  I love their outdoor seating and the there are little rooms inside.  I had a turkey panini with chips and it was really good.  The sand which was big and I took 1/2 home.  We were there in the summer, I would love to come back in the fall and enjoy the outside patio."}
{"text":"What a great way to spend a Saturday morning.  The food, staff, and atmosphere is amazing!"}
{"text":"Monterey Salad with chicken was great. Free refills on a hot day. Bacon grilled cheese was awesome also. A/C was killer.!"}
{"text":"Good food, chill indoor/outdoor vibe, dog-friendly (outdoors unless you have a service dog). You order at the counter and then they give you a number and bring it to your table. Very casual and cool. Tucked in amongst shade trees, little running water sculptures around and away from the street provides an oasis-like quality. Simple menu, but fresh, quality food and a friendly and efficient staff. Easy parking. This place keeps drawing me back for Cave Creek chilling."}
{"text":"Food is OK at best, coffee/latte's are excellent however this place smells AWFUL!! Please air out this place, it is enough to turn anyone's stomach! ICK!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Cobb Salad, possibly the best I've ever had! Yet reasonably priced. Good ambiance, trendy, great service. You have to order at the counter and they bring your meal to you."}
{"text":"Grotto cafe is a tuck away breakfast and lunch  spot in the heart of Care cave.....   My husband and I wanted to have breakfast in our neck of the woods so we decided to try Grotto..  As you walk in through the sliding  door the scent of fresh brew coffee hits you like a ton of bricks...  You wait on line and place your order first than take a seat... Okay I can do that!   The menu isn't extensive or complicated. It was straight and to the point... No standing in line looking up at the menu for 20 mins... Just know your order and order!!!   The place is very spacious and has a comfy, homey feeling... I love it... The staff including the regular customers were helpful.    I had the Grotto bowl with avocado, scramble egg whites, potatoes and a side of applewood bacon. How could I forget the side bowl of fresh fruits.... It was very good!!!   It had a made in your own kitchen taste to it.... Perfect!!!   My husband had the oatmeal with cinnamon and brown sugar...delicious!!   I would definitely stop by again.... Next time the for the Grotto Burrito"}
{"text":"This place is the best place around for breakfast or brunch.  The food is amazing!  Jessica was our server & she was the best.  She went above & beyond to make sure our breakfast was great.  They have a beautiful patio area to enjoy the weather when it's good.  Absolutely beautiful!  The inside area is great too.  If you are in the area you have to go there & try the pulled pork sandwich!"}
{"text":"This place is nice for meeting a friend for lunch or treating your mother! Nice shady patio in a calm, laid back atmosphere. Dog friendly patio with doggy water bowls. Interior is clean with quaint decor. The menu has some good offerings. Friendly service. Will go back for breakfast sometime. Pretty location!"}
{"text":"Good was excellent. Able to order a vegan compliant dish. And it was delicious. Also ordered a peach, pear, and apricot smoothy.  Two  very enthusiastic thumbs up.  Only drawback... it was a bit pricey."}
{"text":"This place was so great. The atmosphere was nice, relaxed. And I loved the large family dinner style tables. There was room for all of us, and we could really enjoy our conversation during our meal.   The menu has a great variety. Collectively, we tried the BBQ chicken salad (huge, and really tasty), fish tacos (good, cucumber was a weird addition, and very filling), carnitas tacos (sooo good. Highly recommend), turkey panini (really good, a little dry, but really good), and the ham and Swiss panini (also really good!).  Overall, delicious meal. Fun place and great service. It was perfect for a family lunch!"}
{"text":"LOVE the grotto. The interior is well-decorated and gives off a great vibe for having a casual lunch or getting coffee with a friend. A few co-workers and I have been coming here once a week for the last few years and it never gets old. Their seasonal tacos are a fan-favorite at the office, but my personal favorite is the hot turkey panini with cranberry!"}
{"text":"Chicken salad sammich was good.. little heavy on mayo... enjoyed the surroundings.. I will be back"}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafes in Arizona. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is very cozy and welcoming. The service is great. Beautiful and large outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Great decor and environment. Lots of tables for meetings or studying, with coffee, tea, beer, and wine selections. The recently installed a tap system for four beers, in addition to several bottles.   My order was pretty boring--cold brew coffee. My wife ordered iced tea. Both were good, but I can't speak to any food items.   It can sometimes be difficult to find places in north Phoenix to simply sit and study. This is a great location.   There was a beautiful outdoors area, but it was 110 outside, so....."}
{"text":"Cool place. Counter girl Cassie has a strange tone. Wifi is horrible.  The owner Curtis really cares. The food isn't anything amazing but the culture is really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I always take \"out of state\" guests to this hidden gem! Super cute antique cafe that has local coffee, breakfast, and huge salads.  I usually go and split the southwest salad between two people and get another entree as well.  My go to--is their cold brew, and chai tea lattes. The patio is perfect to sit outside or even stay inside to enjoy its antique charm.  I love this western town and this coffee shop is perfect to sit back, relax, and enjoy the AZ experience!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped for the first time for breakfast.  I'll say this, the food was 2 stars and the service was 5 star.  We ordered a breakfast Burrito and maybe they put in a  half strip of bacon, the  flour tortilla was to soft, which needed to be grilled. They served it with a small bowl of fruit that looked like it sat out all night.  What disappointment from the reviews we read."}
{"text":"Took a friend here for lunch.  We both decided on the Southwest salad with chicken.  We sat in the front and were served quickly.  I didn't see any chicken on either salad and went to the counter to inquire.  Apparently the staff did not hear me order chicken with the salad (although my friend heard it).  The kitchen said they would add it and that I could pay for one order.  I said that would be fine.  Moments later they brought the chicken to the table and comped me for the order.  Nice touch!  Thank you Grotto!   We enjoyed our salads with the shaved jicama, tomatoes, avocado, fresh greens and chicken.  The salad comes with a cheesy roll that is delicious.  Their homemade chipotle dressing packs a slight punch and has a good taste to it.  It is a bit loud in the front so if you're wanting a quieter lunch, go outside or into the next room,   Otherwise very pleasant.  Plenty of parking available."}
{"text":"I just love this place.  The food and drinks are very well prepared.  The atmosphere is inviting and everything is for sale.  That is that it is a store too.  You are encouraged to try out the tables and chairs with a meal before you buy them.  Great for groups, very accommodating and the prices are very fair.  Free WiFi and outside seating too.  Wonderful office away from office..."}
{"text":"Awesome! First time, perfecto! Tuna salad and egg salad sandwiches were served perfectly! Delicious! Bread was the BEST, too! Will definitely recommend, return and try their other menu items! Must have their house ice tea! Husband got the blueberry muffin, which he said was the BEST he's ever had. Try this place, you'll return, too!"}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is the best! Amazing atmosphere with the mismatched furniture, all of the pictures on the wall, and the laid back (but still professional) attitude of the staff! I had the best iced chai I've had in a long time (and I'm an avid sbux customer). The food was hard to chose from as it all looked good. My husband got biscuits and gravy, which I tried. They were great! He can't always handle the spice of the southwest, so this was the perfect meal. It had just the right amount of kick for him, and the biscuits weren't drowning in gravy like most places, the proportions were perfect. The fruit along side both of our meals was fresh and refreshing! I got the burrito with chorizo. I had to wait to eat it (my only disappointment), because it was so steaming hot and fresh!!! Once it cooled off, it was perfect!!! An added touch, as each customer left, the staffed wished them well! If you get there early enough and it's not too hot yet, the porch is beautiful!  The owner was also VERY involved! He was behind the counter getting out drinks (before we were even done ordering!) and was clearing plates from tables, refilling drinks and thanking us for hanging out with them!! Love love love!!!"}
{"text":"We love the Grotto. Love the breakfast bowls and they make a great cup of java. On a nice day, the patio is a lovely place to dine. The decorations on the inside are retro and fun. Definitely would like to try it for lunch sometime.  Nice place and worth the drive"}
{"text":"The veggie breakfast burrito is really terrible. It had only scrambled eggs and dry home fries with salsa verde on the side. No other seasoning, and the salsa flavors didn't even blend well with the bland main. Couldn't they at least add beans? Cilantro? Anything else to make it even worth the $9?   I'm giving this place two stars only because the employees were friendly. My friends liked their food, and it sounds like the breakfast burrito with chorizo was good. Decent mini fruit salad that came with it as well with blueberries, grapes, and melon. (At least it wasn't all melon like many restaurant fruit salads.)"}
{"text":"5 stars for ambiance, customer service, food and coffee.   Ambiance: the patio is amazing. Charming, eclectic, and totally Cave Creek. Fascinated at all the little unique details. Inside you sit on furniture for sale by Red Truck Trading.  Free wifi (yay)  Customer Service: friendly staff! They are so genuinely nice, cheery. You do stand in line to order, and sometimes the line can be long, but the food is almost delivered before you sit down.   FOOD: pulled pork tacos. Chicken salad sandwich. Salads. We have not had anything we don't like. And they serve beer and wine. A great place to stop when strolling through Cave Creek, and often where we go after hiking Black Mountain.   Coffee: they use Roastery of Cave Creek beans. It's prob a combo of the quality beans and skilled brewing technique, but whatever it is, their coffee is damned delicious. And THE BEST iced coffee anywhere."}
{"text":"Such a cute little cafe!  The patio is dog friendly with lots of shade. I like how the tables aren't close together so you can relax and enjoy your food.   I ordered the breakfast sandwich. Sadly my bagel was burned. Why would you ever serve someone burned food??? That's a chef that just doesn't care."}
{"text":"Chicken salad was great. The French dip fell a little short. We had a hard time getting our drinks refill. Atmosphere is very good the place has an excellent vibe. Too bad they close at 6 PM would be a great evening place ."}
{"text":"Great place for fresh food, panninis, sandwiches , relaxing outdoor patio.  Very relaxing.  Great coffee and drinks/smoothes, my niece loved their mango smoothie.  Service - friendly and fast  Sandwiches were good with fresh bread and fresh veggies.  chicken salad (5/5) - loved it the right balance of savory and sweet and texture with green apple, cranberries, pecans, perfect with the cranberry walnut bread  southwestern salad (4/5) - which was very different from others, lighter and the only real south western feel is the avocado and tomato, the jicama and lime dressing kept it light and refreshing.  pulled pork(4/5) was yummy, but needed something crunchy it was a little plain, but I liked the pork was tender and sauce not too sweet.  pastries(3/5) were good had a rolled pastry with almond and rasberry"}
{"text":"Best iced coffee i've ever had! 5+ stars for that!     However, the food quality is variable - sometimes it's excellent; at other times, it's barely edible, especially during the summer months, when business slows down. (They tend to serve stale bread then - so stale that toasting hardens it to the consistency of lacquered cardboard, impossible to chew.)      I would not recommend the lox; the meager amount of meat was mushy, and the tiny \"serving\" of cream cheese was laughable - you could barely see it."}
{"text":"We loved it so much that we went two days in a row while on vacation. Great food, great staff, nice ambience , convenient location and parking. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This place is a blast. Our motorcycle group went for a Sunday morning ride to Cave Creek with this destination in mind. They are known for their oatmeal. I got \"the works\". It was delicious. Sitting outside was comfortable, although inside seating also looked fine. The wait staff was quick and efficient and friendly. The Grotto Cafe is an eclectic place with fun posters and photos on the walls. Breakfast and lunch only. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"This was our first and last time at Grotto. We were new to the restaurant so didn't know the menu, the cashier taking the order was not too friendly.  There were no seats available on the patio so had to eat inside.  The table was located near the bathroom, which was not pleasant at all.  Once the food came the experience did not get much better.  The eggs tasted microwaved and there was a live inch worm in my sons fruit.  Needless to say we do not have very good things to say."}
{"text":"I had such a fabulous time with my friends last night that I just have to tell you about it. My very good friend David Sheehy got a new gig. He is now the House Musician at The Grotto Cafe in Cave Creek. I'd wax poetic about Dave, most of you know how much I enjoy his music, it's the place I have to tell you about. It was the most ...enjoyable venue I have been to in a very long time. The food was great with such reasonable prices that I feel like I could hang there all weekend instead of a big night out. The staff so friendly and helpful, the patio one of the most beautiful I've seen in the area and the atmosphere inside is the kind of eclectic feel I adore. David is now playing Friday, Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons. If there was ever a time to check out his great music, this is it.  The Grotto is uniquely located in a consignment shop called The Red Truck Trading Company. I noticed that there is a review on here by a disgruntled consignment customer and I'd like to address that. I spent the evening sitting on a very comfortable dining chair that, had it with my decor, I would have come home with the set because I \"test drove\" it more so than in a normal furniture store. My husband felt the same way about the chairs AND the table we were at. So, Bob P., I have to tell you, you are getting a unique opportunity to have your consigned items marketed. I walk in and out of consignment stores all the time and the chair I was sitting on last night wouldn't even have crossed my radar, yet I found myself wondering if it would be worth refinishing to work in my home. Great way to market used furniture, but I stray.  Come to The Grotto Cafe, Come to hear my good friend David Sheehy sing and stay for the food, the ambience and funky decor."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little breakfast/lunch place!  The atmosphere is outstanding, whether you choose to eat inside near the counter/bar, further inside in one of the semi-separate rooms, or outside in the little garden \"grotto\".  The staff were all very friendly and accommodating!  My friend and I both ordered the tuna salad sandwich, and it was the BEST I've ever had; definitely not from a can. Now I wish that my friend had ordered something else so that we could have shared two different items. As I looked around, the other customers also seemed to have awesome lunches. Loved the homemade chips, too, and the wide variety of hot and iced coffees, very reasonably priced. (They also have beer and wine.)  The menu is compact, which is a good thing. Apparently, the chef has picked just a few items and has focused on making them great!  Can't wait to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I come here often for lunch! My favorites are between the Cranberry Chicken Salad sandwich and the BBQ chicken salad! The staff Is always so helpful and courteous. The place is cozy and quaint!"}
{"text":"This place makes you feel so good. Wow what a vibe. Food was great. The decor is so interesting and Curtis (the co-owner) talked with us at length. I'm definitely going to be a regular."}
{"text":"This is by far the Best Chicken Salad plate in the Southwest. Highly recommended by the locals. P.S. The cookies, well the cookies are.... I will leave it to your eyes."}
{"text":"Hidden little gem perfect for breakfast or lunch. The decor was very unique and made the experience fun. The staff is friendly and made small talk to get to know the customers. The food was amazing. I am coffee snob and always skeptical of new places. I love the ice white chocolate. I will be making the drive back again."}
{"text":"Nice spot with outside seating on a garden type setting.  Food was good - menu somewhat limited.  Must like dogs as they are prevalent- with their owners.  Lots of options in the area - give this one a try!"}
{"text":"Great community  hang out place, with terrific ambiance, good service and great food.  The chicken sandwich is so good.  Salads are fresh.  Servers are welcoming.  Food is ordered and then delivered to your table....if you can find a table at certain times.  Becoming very popular place in Cave Creek.  Tables outside are nice and dogs are welcome.....So glad this  is in Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"I took my grandson to one of my favorite places , the grotto, for lattes. I'd never had their coffee yet so I decided on a mocha and as I was telling the lady at the counter that the one drink I'm familiar with is carmel macchiato she said Michael could make me a drink like it. So of course I changed my order and said go for it. He made a great carmel latte. Loved it. Good job Michael !!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, as close to a New York Bagel you will get outside of NY. Very good breads. All staff are friendly and helpful. A good way to start the day."}
{"text":"In the midst of the overly wrought tourist atmosphere of Cave Creek, this is a nice respite.  You can hear the dew-rag Harley crowd making their way to the big bars where everyone dresses the same and rides the same style of bike, but it is just background sound that is not intrusive.   Place your order, get a number, and find a place to sit, either inside or out.  All good.  We have been at this complex of shopping and eating numerous times and find it pleasant.  Breakfast and sandwich menu.  Compact bar/order area, and lots of varied seating options, inside and out.  Reasonable prices and the sandwiches and service are quite good."}
{"text":"I'll start with the things that I like about the place: The atmosphere is just lovely and the place is decorated with really neat little trinkets and cool furniture, most of which is for sale, I believe! The food is tasty, I like that they have healthy options for my and hearty breakfast burritos for my burly man!   The 3 star rating is a result of the fact that I've never had a sip of coffee there that I truly enjoyed, apart from the nonfat iced vanilla latte. There is no amount of cream and sugar that can save a plain old cup of joe around there. The chai is too spicy and not sweet enough for my liking, the espresso and coffee are too bitter for my tastes, and the only drinkable thing (the lattes) are way overpriced.   Honestly, try Janey's coffeehouse down the street. They've got a MUCH more friendly staff, and much more delicious chai (my personal favorite of all time, in fact). Better quality coffee and an overall better experience."}
{"text":"The outside patio is everything. So beautiful and peaceful. Even a roadrunner made an appearance through the patio. This place is very relaxed, pretty basic breakfast fare, rustic and old timey feel just like Cave Creek itself. My breakfast sandwich was tasty and we enjoyed sitting outside for a couple of hours. Plenty of easy parking and open tables on a Wednesday morning."}
{"text":"Perfect place for breakfast or lunch.  The coffee is from Roc2 and it is always perfect.  The patio is a wonderful place to enjoy an excellent chicken salad sandwich and gazpacho.  We go there about once a week...we can't resist!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches and drink selection!   Very unique atmosphere - and one of the best Patios in Cave Creek, which is saying a lot!  Their patio is also pet friendly! Lots of fun taking our yellow lab there for good sniffs and good people."}
{"text":"Wonderful local spot with lush patio setting and cozy indoor ambiance. Great service, food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Fun little place to stop and have lunch. There was plenty of parking out back, and more tables on the patio than there was inside. The lunch menu has all the basics. I chose the turkey sandwich which was very moist and tasty. I also ordered a strawberry banana smoothie which hit the spot on this hot day. This a dog friendly place that has tie outs here and there."}
{"text":"This is a nice ambiance. On a sunny day it's important to sit in the patio. Food is great and the coffee is excellent. This is a must visit place in Cavecreek"}
{"text":"Wow! My daughter and I were not disappointed with the Grotto Cafe today. We ordered the southwest salad, cold turkey sandwich, and iced tea. Everything was fantastic. The setting is lovely too. Despite being busy, they were efficient, and brought our food out far faster than I expected. I would highly recommend this place and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a neat place tucked in off the Main Street here in Cave Creek. Very good espresso."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! The roast beef panini was delicious. Nice outside seating, good for kids, funky artwork."}
{"text":"The bagels are fresh and just the way I like them, big! Good breakfast and great lunch! You really can't beat the eclectic ambiance both indoor and out. I could sit all day and people and dog watch. They also have a good selection of iced tea which I like more than coffee."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a little fuel after hiking Pinnacle Peak with my wife. Awesome place for something quick and tasty. The courtyard is where we sat and it was very relaxing. Can't imagine how the courtyard will be since it's getting so warm now but if you can get there early, enjoy it.  I ordered the breakfast burrito which came with a side of fruit.   We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Fun place! Sitting inside and outside. It was a nice day out so outside seating was limited but we found a quiet spot inside. Pulled bbq beef was good. So was the chicken salad sandwich. Nice portion sizes at a fair price. The staff was very friendly and polite."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating at Grotto Cafe several times a week. I like the Iced Coffee. Their salads are very tasty and always look so good. i have tried the Monterey, the Southwestern and their new Eggless Cesar Salad which is my new favorite.The Grotto Cafe has great employees who work very hard to make their customers happy.    ."}
{"text":"Outstanding Service Excellent food selection and very tasty food Awesome People Thank you guys for your outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"First, just what I was looking for in the land of grease/burgers/ribs. This is a sweet spot tucked in the back of a center, has a large patio area (great for when the weather allows) and what appear to be a large indoor seating area. They serve breakfast until noon and lunch after. Lunch options are sandwiches, salads, a few bowls, and enchilada soup. And before I forget, service was fast and friendly :-)  We were there after 12:00 and chose a bacon avocado sandwich on sourdough (crust is a very chewy and crusty, so be aware if you have any dental issues going on), a Cobb Salad, and a cup of soup (had to try it based on other reviews). The sandwich was a success minus the crust for some ongoing isssues, the soup was mildly spicy, hot, came with spiced tortilla strips on top and had plenty of cubed chicken in it. The soup is more of a cream base, than a broth base. It was flavorful and probably would hit the spot on a cold day. The Cobb Salad was HUGE, easily could have fed two and was LOADED with chicken, egg, avocado, and blue cheese. It was also a little heavily dressed with the house made French dressing. I wasn't particularly a fan and would probably request a different dressing on the side next time. It also came with a small piece of focaccia.  There is a fairly extensive coffee and menu as well as iced tea and chai. One star off for the dressing on the salad all around, but honestly it's a great spot in an area that doesn't particularly focus on lighter fare. Can't wait to go back and try it again!"}
{"text":"Best bloody Mary ive had in a while! It was only missing green olives. The red truck burrito with the apple chicken sausage was delicious!  And the patio environment was perfect for a Sunday brunch! Staff was delightful as well. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Decent coffee and an interesting menu... plus, if you are an avid people and doggy watcher... it is the place to be,"}
{"text":"I come here when I'm in town for work. Cute place with lots of little tables, good menu and friendly people. Recommend."}
{"text":"A great spot for lunch on the outdoor patio. I had a blended kona mocha javaccino, very refreshing on a hot sunny fall day. The grilled ham and cheese on gluten free bread was flavorful, with a side of chips and a pickle. My husband had the chicken salad sandwich on cranberry bread and a lemonade. Overall, we're very happy with the quality of the food, the friendly staff and the menu selections. They also serve breakfast, which my husband had - a bowl with hash browns, eggs and sausage with a side of fresh fruit."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure great service interesting and wonderful menu ... Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"4 stars for the latte but I have to give 3 stars for the rest of the experience. The veggie sandwich was good in theory (all great ingredients) but it was SO greasy! Kinda defeats the purpose of a veggie sandwich. Idk if they dipped their veggies in lard before cooking but blech! The other thing that is really lacking on their menu is a half sandwich/cup of soup lunch deal. They really need to get with the deal here as this is one of the most popular things to order for a lunch."}
{"text":"First time here and the girls attitude working the counter helped us decide not to come back. We didn't even want to order. The only reason I'm not giving it 1 star is because it smelled like bacon."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to stop for delicious food and good vibes! We enjoyed an amazing breakfast of their famous oatmeal with \"the works\" and biscuits and gravy with applewood bacon. The owner, Curtis, personally stopped by our table to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and everything was perfect! We will definitely be back! THANK-YOU"}
{"text":"Good food and fast service.  Nice atmosphere too.  Great place for lunch after browsing the nearby stores or while you wife goes to beauty salon next door."}
{"text":"We always stop here when we're in town. Food is above average. Add that to a nice outdoor patio ( if you can get a table ), and it's a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch!  Can't think of anything negative. Food was delicious, staff was so friendly and it was very clean. Free refills on all drinks including ice coffee. Portions were more than enough. If I could give it more stars I would."}
{"text":"So impressed with this place...if it hadn't been for the power outage this morning and another Cave Creek business sending me here, I would have never gone I think. While there was a line out the door, the staff was friendly and efficient. My small latte was ready in no time and was very tasty. My burrito was awesome, nice and piping hot with superbly fresh ingredients.  The mood and the atmosphere were cozy with locals and snowbirds gathered around the tables outside. I ate with my pooch who welcomed the treats from a mailbox nearby. Friendly conversation was flowing and possibly new friends were made. Very impressed with this place and very likely to return..."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and drinks.  Great for meetings of many sizes.  With wifi available it is the perfect office between meetings."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and wonderful coffee. We had a late lunch and it was the best food I've had since I've been here (2 weeks).  My husband and I split the chicken salad sandwich and the southwest salad. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here today for lunch. It was a beautiful day to sit on the patio with a nice breeze. The staff was friendly. I had an egg salad sandwich and a cup of the house enchilada soup. The egg salad was watery and the bread was partially toasted. The soup was so hot with spices that I couldn't eat it. I'm sure this is just one instance and that the rest of the menu is fine."}
{"text":"Lox and bagel - bagel was average and lox was a bit tasteless. Big upgrade opportunity.  Burrito - chicken sausage was good.  Potatoes seasoned well but could have been cooked a bit longer.  Coffee was good. Iced Americano was on the weak side.   Worst part of experience - they don't take American Express!! That's just ridiculous.   Tend to not go back to places that don't want to take my money.  Best part - if you can get by the part with the grown men wearing leather pants (fancy motorcycle outfits), the outside atmosphere is great to hang out."}
{"text":"Cool, hip atmosphere with a chill vibe.  Great coffee, creative menu.  Great place to hang out and use their Wifi or meet up with friends.  Big outdoor space that allows dogs (woof!) and wonderful interior with more great places and separate little rooms for more privacy.  I'll definitely come here again."}

{"text":"Great coffee and the breakfast burritos were delicious.   would've really liked to have red salsa as an option.   Great outdoor seating area too!"}
{"text":"The Grotto Café is a quant hideaway that can have you relaxing for hours either indoors or out.  For breakfast we tried the Red Truck Bagel Sandwich and the Grotto Bowl with bacon and egg whites and coffee...all was delicious! Since we were out of towners we decided to get the bagels and lox to go...and that did NOT disappoint!  Everything was so good, we came back the next day for lunch and ordered the special of the day, fish taco's and carnitas taco's both were deserving of a thumbs up!  We came on the recommendation of the homeowner of the Air B&B we stayed at in Cave Creek for Arizona Bike Week 2018. We will definitely see you in 2019!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Grotto! It's such a great spot to hang out at in the mornings, have some coffee, and enjoy great food. Lunch here is also great, with various options including sandwiches, salads, etc.  There's plenty of seating inside and out, everyone is very friendly, and the restaurant is overall a cozy place. You feel like you're hanging out in your living room, which makes it great for a relaxing meal or meeting with a group of friends.  For breakfast, I highly recommend the burrito and the chicken salad sandwich for lunch."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and I was not disappointed.  Great place to meet friends for a quick bite or morning coffee.  Food is good, staff is friendly and service is quick.  Plenty of room for outdoor as well as indoor seating.  Definitely a go to place in Cave Creek!"}

{"text":"I would come here every single day if I could. Great food, great coffee and great people! Very relaxing spot to be in cave creek."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Great service.  Nice staff.  Great atmosphere.  Loved sitting outside in the courtyard."}
{"text":"Our first trip here for breakfast and we really enjoyed the atmosphere and oatmeal.  The oatmeal is steel cut with fresh berries and bananas. The indoor and outdoor space is large and has some character. It is a bit pricey but Cave Creek tends to be that way."}
{"text":"I visited during lunch. The outside patio is so nice! I ordered the chicken salad sandwich. It was DELICIOUS! Reasonably priced, and the staff was nice. I would love to come back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Lively setting for an afternoon of wine and snacks.  I forget what I had ? but it was good."}
{"text":"This was our 1st time here and it was well worth the drive up! Great breakfast & lunch items and the town of cave creek is really unique and a great day trip."}
{"text":"I love the grotto for it's laid back atmosphere and friendly service. We enjoy the coffee and tea (unlimited refills) and their famous blueberry scones! This last time I went, my blueberry scone was undercooked and I brought it up to the staff. They apologized profusely and replaced it, but also gave me a coupon for a free entree. In my mind, this is what makes the Grotto Cafe a local must."}
{"text":"The BEST oatmeal I've ever tasted! Great atmosphere both inside and out on the patio. Super friendly staff. I'm definitely heading back the future."}
{"text":"For breakfast or lunch, this is a great place. Walk up counter where you order from a very large menu of  breakfast items sold until noon and also a big variety of sandwicges. Our part got a variety of BK burritos and sandwiches which came to our table in about 10 minutes. The place was very busy with what seemed like a lot of Cave Creek locals. All the dishes were very good; tuna salad sandwich, grilled cheese with tomato and bacon, vegi panini and 2 BK burritos. Great food, good prices and a warm and casual decor. Definately will be back."}
