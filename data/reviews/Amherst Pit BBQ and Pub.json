{"text":"Always fantastic! Loaded pulled pork fries will be on the menu in my version of Heaven. My picky 4 year old loves the chunky cinnamon applesauce. Nachos are excellent, brisket, chicken, variety of sauce, pie...OH MY...I could go on and on about the pie. I had a peanut butter, chocolate, salted caramel pie with a meringue top...YES people, all that is in one pie ...and it tastes as ridiculously good as it sounds! LOVE this place, I try to make it a point to go once a week. Can't wait to try the breakfast!! :)"}
{"text":"No. If this is the best barbecue you've ever eaten, you need to go somewhere that has good barbecue. It is not the equivalent of a Texas barbecue. The first clue was that you couldn't smell the smoke in the parking lot. The meat was clearly reheated, the sides tasted like they were out of cans or frozen food boxes. However, the portions were big, the sauces were decent, and the cornbread was good. If you could figure out what day they actually cook the meat and go then, you might have a better experience. The location was fine, but the interior smelled like a combination of mildew and skunks. We sat on the porch, and a neighbor's dog came up to hang out. The employees didn't care, and when I tried to shoo it from our table it snapped at me. So... Yeah. Also, no alcohol sales on Sunday."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Closest thing to Texas BBQ that we have found around here. We got the family fest and it was worth every penny. The meat was delicious, sauces were on point and the sides were icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"Good food but bad business sense would rather turn people away then tell them a wait time to get their food tried to talk to owners wife about the kids doing nothing but sending people away. She told me that is what I told them to do.  I asked her why and she told me I am running the business. I asked her if I could help because I have a BSEE and a minor in business"}
{"text":"Great service great food. Big portions, handcut fries are awesome be sure to get them with the parm garlic sauce!"}
{"text":"This is the first review but I am not being generous. The brisket was very good. There are a variety of BBQ sauces to choose from. Mine was Honey Bourbon. Tasty. We had onion rings for an appetizer that were very good as well. The Shrimp Dinner had 10 butterflied shrimp deep fried to perfection. They have many sides to choose from as well. We all chose fresh cut fries which were actually wedges. The cornbread was a bit dry. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem. Good BBQ along with some really good sauces. Nice people. Prices are good too."}
{"text":"Great place tucked away in the city of Amherst, in the old stone village. They have a full Bbq menu, including kids. The price isn't bad and it's great when considering the food. The people are friendly and interesting. First time we ate here there was a bartender that treated the wait staff very badly, but he is gone (owner very pro active in making it a great atmosphere for customers and employees, meet the owner at another event and that's when we gave it a second chance, been back many times). Props have to go to the current bartender he does a great job helping with the to go orders (we get to go often). Just added a breakfast menu, haven't been here yet for that but we will try it. Hoping to make it here when the village is open, I think it will be a great outing."}
{"text":"Brisket dip with au ju and sweet potato hash were Amazing! Excellent service and quaint environment."}
{"text":"This place just opened in July, and I've been there 4 times already and planning to go back again and again.  Fantastic brisket!  We usually order the family platter and it is easily enough for 4.  You get brisket, wings, ribs, pulled pork and sausage plus 4 sides for $40.  You can't beat it.  All the food is excellent, I the brisket is my favorite.  Staff is friendly the atmosphere is quiet.  I don't post many reviews or get excited about food places often, but the Pit is my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"I have to say this was unexpectedly wonderful.   I was cruising along the Ohio turnpike dreading a meal at one of the rest areas so I opened up Yelp to see if there was anything nearby that sounded good.  This place looked perfect and it really impressed me.  The service was so incredibly polite and friendly.  I had the brisket nachos and the rib dinner.  The nachos came out with tons of cheese and meat.  Perfect.  I made each bite with some brisket, tomatoes,  sour cream, cheese,  some habenero BBQ sauce and salsa.  Every bite was awesome.   I could have just eaten the Nachos but since the brisket was so good I had yo try the rib dinner.  The ribs are a bit fatty but fall off the bone, tender and tasty.  Incredible!  No diet food here!  Dig in!! I got beans and slaw and they are made on site and equally yummy.  The slaw was very creamy and the beans have a nice dark BBQ sauce.  I tried the hickory sauce and the hot garlic both were great.  Deep flavors, nice rich sauce."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch and had a great experience. We ordered their smoked wings with the garlic sauce for an appetizer. Which were surprisingly pretty good. He had the brisket sandwich and I had the slider trio. So I got to sample the brisket, chicken and pork. All three were good but the pork was the best.  Was a lot of food, so took quite a bit home.  Service was excellent, decor cute and cozy. They have a small bar in front with dining room in back. It's in a house remolded into restaurant. There's also a big deck and patio seating available for warmer months.  Overall, a very nice place. Would go again."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away but you will be pleased when you search just a little to find it!  Good food!  Great prices!  Amazing Wait Staff!"}
{"text":"Some of the best briscut i have ever had. The smokey habanero bbq sauce has just the right right touch of heat if your a fan of spice. Great sides too, the southern greens were fantastic. Service was great, as was the conversation with the proprietor Chuck. Can't wait to get back this summer to try out the huge porch."}
