{"text":"Came here on Friday night for dinner and had to wait for 30 mins to get even our appetizers! The portions are small and the dishes are not great. We ordered choke bhature where the bhatura was not puffed at all. The kid is really sweet but they need to improve their service and food!"}
{"text":"Super awesome place with great dishes and services. The food is super yummy and you can get it customized especially if you want less oil. I would recommend this retaurant ."}
{"text":"if you're a newbie like me and need a benchmark to start, then start at bay leaf cafe. Not only the service is outstanding but the food quality is not compromised by the dull ambience. definitely the best cuisine in chandler/phoenix area. I would go as far as to say the birani and meatballs (goftha) are one of the best and tastiest i've had in a long time. Ordered a plate of chapeli kabob and was blown away. super tender yet and well spiced.. spice level is perfect for folks that can handle 3-4 on a 5 point scale. will recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this cafe!  I eat here every couple of weeks and the food is consistently great.  The spices are bold and flavorful & the portions are large.  If there's something you want that isn't on the menu - just ask and they will make it if possible.   The service is good and the staff take the time to explain the dishes which is extremely helpful for those that aren't familiar with Indian food.  They also have a lunch special that has 5 or 6 different items so you can get a taste of everything."}
{"text":"First time eating Indian in Chandler. I'm visiting from the PNW and my relatives asked if Indian was okay. I'm a huge fan of Indian food so of course I agreed. The food was great. Small portions but good. I felt like I was full enough but could probably still eat more if available. We ordered two main dishes and some garlic naan for the four of us. I feel like these portions were just smaller than other Indian places. One of the curry chickens came attached to the bone so I didn't eat a much of that chicken than the other chicken that came pre-cubed. I say great food, although I guess I have high expectations of Indian food from where I live in Portland, OR and Tacoma, WA. I'm sad they didn't offer anything like chicken or more importantly lamb kabobs. Good for takeout !! Oh and definitely ask if you have the right number/restaurant when you call. We got confused when the lady who answered the phone only said, \"hello\" and then the ID number came up on the tv as a \"spa\" so I guess they offer more than just Indian dishes !! :-/"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise!   I have driven by this place so many times and had the wonderful opportunity to eat there tonight. The owner was delightful and made excellent recommendations from wine and the India brewed lager to our dinner selections. The food was magnificent. Cooked perfectly and beautiful presentation. We ate beyond full it was so good!  Certainly a gem in South Chandler. If you like Indian food or were thinking of trying it for the first time Bay Leaf Cafe is a must eat!"}
{"text":"I placed a to-go order and was given a 35 minute wait time.  When we arrived to pick up the food, it was not ready yet, so we had to wait around bringing the total time closer to 45 minutes.  The food was really delicious.  We had Chicken Tikka Masala, Alu Gobi, and Paneer Tikka Masala. The Alu Gobi was great and well-spiced.  I realized that we were never asked for a \"spice level\" like at some restaurants, and I think I like having the food prepared the way the chef intends.  That might be disagreeable to you if you don't enjoy spicy foods.  The naan was great, as it usually is.  The rice came with our meals, although the amount was a less than what is usually provided with an entree.  I think they might have been trying to avoid making another batch since it was kind of late.  So in recap, the food (most importantly) was very good.  The only complaint would be that the amount of rice was a little skimpy and the extra wait time.  These things are pretty minor to me for the convenience and good food.  I would order from Bay Leaf Cafe again, and I probably will."}
{"text":"Called the restaurant ahead of time and was pleased to know they are BYO friendly.  This family owned establishment was very welcoming and accommodating. The food was great, and we are in love with the Naan.  Every flavor was devoured and the kids begged for more. The kids stuck to the fairly mainstream items, only cause that's what they like.  Love their sauces and Tikka Masala.  FYI closed Mondays....they day I always crave it."}
{"text":"The lunch is perfect! The service at lunch was great with white table and chairs, and the friendly front desk young man. The food was excellent. Since it was our first time, we ordered the rice bowl, which you can taste 6 dishes. We also ordered nan, which is also fresh. The place is hard to spot from outside and no one would guess it is an Indian restaurant by its name and sign. The place is cozy. The other pictures on Yelp were confusing. I wish there is more photo about the food, not the party. The rice bowl is the way to go if it is your first time."}
{"text":"Had been before but this time was terrible. Saturday evening 5.30.  Prob. 10 people in restaurant yet guy was rushed off his feet. Didn't get water for 5 mins.  Food was disappointing. Far too spicey. Needlessly so.  Didn't eat half of food and not worth taking home.  Server had no personality and telling people where to sit? Even though it was almost empty?! Will not be back"}
{"text":"im one of rambha s client who alwayes comes for her,, now she has a very good resturant has the best indian food,, omg the food is soooo good  , everytime i go to the salon,, i have to get something to eat ,, i bring my familly and friends there and they love it, i think this resturant will bring alot of business to the salon,, so to whoever yo should go try thge resturant u will love it........"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good.  Smaller portions than your traditional Indian restaurant but then again it is a \"cafe\".  Its a family owned restaurant with them owning the yogurt shop and salon adjacent to them.    I prefer spicier food and have found that you have to make it clear you want Indian spicy hot or they wont make it so. The naan is awesome; garlic all the way.  I usually do the chicken tikka masala with the naan.  They offer discounts for Intel and other companies in the area.  However, if you do the yelp deal you cant combine them."}
{"text":"Loved the chole and Paneer tikka masala. Paneer tikka had a totally different gravy, never tasted such gravy earlier. Highly recommend this restaurant to experience a unique taste."}
{"text":"This family-run cafe is open less than two months, but I think they are on to a winner - the food is lovely and well-priced, the staff welcoming, the portions good. Minor niggle is the disposable plates and cutlery, but don't let it frighten you off - otherwise this is a nice place to have a meal."}
{"text":"Went for lunch a week ago and was super impressed with the quality of the food. The service was excellent and the food was amazing.  We both had the lunch \"buffet\" which they served us. There was a selection of 6 dishes pre-made on the steam table, and they were all exceptional. 3 of the 6 were vegetarian selections, and if all vegetarian food tasted so good, I'd never eat meat again. We also ordered fresh Naan bread and it was terrific.  The frozen ice cream-like dessert was very good and certainly will order more the next time I'm in.  I work nearby and I can't believe this place doesn't get more word of mouth business. All my business lunches will be held here for sure.     You owe it to yourself to try this place."}
{"text":"Never going back to this restaurant.  Worst customer service ever. We reached to the cafe around 1:10pm and front desk took almost 5mins to guide us to our respective seats ( Note: no other customer in the cafe except us ). After 15mins we got our menu and waiter took another 10mins to take order. And after a long wait of 45mins - 1hr we got our tasteless uncooked colored food. (Ordered gobi manchuria, kadai paneer and peas pulav).   We couldn't eat the food in restaurant as there was hell lot of chaos from the kitchen, Wish we can go back in time and not be in this restaurant ever."}
{"text":"Freshly prepared food and good Indian  taste. U can pre-order and go there to save time if u want :)"}
{"text":"it was an unpleasant visit.  food was ready to pick up after 50min.  i got the deal from groupon and the deal said either dine in or to go.  so i called to order to go and the lady who took my order was nice and have not problem when i mentioned i'm going to use my groupon.   but when i went pick up the 'man' who refuse to take groupon and said not for to go.  so i end up paid it without using my groupon.  I was very upset and felt like cheated from the restaurant.  so beaware!!!!"}
{"text":"Greatest Indian food in Fulton ranch area!  Their lunch plate is an awesome delicious deal!!"}
{"text":"Ordered tandoori grill, worst chicken,stale chicken , the grill chicken had a stale smell and was too dry and hard to bite, seemed like it was recooked and it was tasteless too, got biryani for my kids, portion size was too small , no value for money, biryani too was tasteless and being an Indian I feel sad to say this is the worst Indian restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Love this place. The chicken tikka masala is really good and the rice bowl is such a good deal."}
{"text":"Geat curry and naan. Grab and go lunches. Friendly staff. They now have real silver wear, cloth napkins and real plates!"}
{"text":"Still love this place. We get takeout often and the flavor is always outstanding. When I do dine in it's for lunch and always get the rice bowl. Great sampling of all their wonderful food for a great price. Always had good service and found the place very clean and the staff professional. I had no clue about Indian food until Bay Leaf opened up and it's now become my favorite foreign cuisine."}
{"text":"This place has cheap quality service, products and food. Ordered tandoori chicken that was dry and bad. Worst indian food I have eaten."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best chicken tikki masala I have ever had. The owners are extremely nice and the service is excellent. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place for the first time tonight. The food is fantastic and the service is really attentive. We will be returning to this place as often as possible."}
{"text":"Food is very tastey but not intensely seasoned. Just right for my wife. They don't have the expected Indian lunch buffet. Instead their rice bowl is one of the best deals around, 6 generous portions of entrees with the rice. The  Chicken Tikka Masala is our favorite. The dining area is pleasing and the service is always cheerful and accomidating. One of my Chandler favorites."}
{"text":"I've always had great food here. Clean bold flavors and good ingredients. I've always taken food to go and have never dined in. Great for a quick after work togo meal"}
{"text":"it's the real deal! Authentic Indian food with no fuss! owners were very welcoming as if we were visiting their home. food was extremely flavorful! At first the menu seemed a little pricey for the atmosphere...but with a coupon, the freebies the owners threw in, and after eating, it was well worth it.  The paper/plastic utensils didnt bother us one bit.... it's all part of the experience right!? and who eats Indian with utensils anyways! we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This little place outs out some great Indian food!  If you want something totally different, give them a chance!"}
{"text":"This is for the lunch special. It's a pretty great deal (6$) for the right amount of food. I couldn't finish mine and the boyfriend left full as well. It had a variety-chicken tikka, dhal, okra, potato curry thing, the cheese in the Orange sauce (paneer? I don't know. It wasn't green), and another chicken dish with rice. It was good food, not spicy but I'm sure they would make it hotter if we wanted it spicy. It was good, will be going again."}
{"text":"2nd time here and will definitely be back for a 3rd. Ambience is lacking, but the food is wonderful. We had three dishes tonight, a curry, a masala, and a biryani.  All were very good. Naan was just the right addition. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"We decided to go back to this restaurant for lunch. This time we both ordered the lunch bowl. The service was really fast and the food was really good. The rice bowl came with paneer masala, chicken curry, chicken tikka masala, okra, garbanzo beans, & some cauliflower and potato. The paneer & chicken tikka were my favorites but the rest of the choices were good as well. The cost for the plate was $6.55 with tax. Definitely worth it! I'll definitely come back for it."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food we've had in Arizona, and a plus is that they're not closed half the day like most Indian restaurants. The palak panner and pakoras are amazing, but I believe we were supposed to have naan with our mixed grill and didn't. Service was good, but its pricier than most comparable places. There are two large screen tvs on opposite walls which is fine but when eating out, I'd rather not have competing channels blaring at me."}
{"text":"I have been here twice once when it first opened. At the average cost of $14.00 a head we ate off the cardboard plates and were put off, although the food wasn't bad, but not at all spicy. I thought I would give it a second try. This time I did a takeout - I ordered two chicken Tikka Masalas medium spice  and a tandoori chicken for a friend who does not like curry - rice came with all three dishes and we ordered Naan breads too. The masala have 10 small chucks of chicken in them in a pale yellow fairly bland sauce and the tandoori chicken which should be dry was served with peppers and onion fry with a chili paste which they then coated the chicken with! Most of it got thrown away. I did return one masala which they gave me store credit for ($10.95) with two explanations - One, each chef has a variation on how they cook the dishes (our chef had decided that tomatoes shouldn't be a part of our tomato based curry).  Two, for our American customers we tell them not too cook it spicy! Sorry Bay Leaf Owners, but in my opinion consistency is an important part of running a restaurant"}
{"text":"I was very pleased I stopped here for a meal.  I have had tons of good Indian food having lived in California, though even there it can be harder to find more healthy dishes.    I had the Cauliflowe Bizule and my first bite was a OMGosh, it was so wonderful.  The flavor a were such a nice mixture of spices and it was nice that it was not breaded and deep fried so healthier.  When my server (I think the owner) knew I was from CA and had had a lot of good Indian food he suggested the Afgani Boti Kabab.  He created this recipe himself and again the flavor a were wonderful and the chicken moist.    I asked for a lassi that was barely sweet and it was wonderful with cardamom and other spices not always found in a lassi.   So it was also very nice that I could say I didn't want anything really spicy or sweet and I got directed to what would work for me or they adjusted the food accordingly.  I will defiantly be back with my husband."}
{"text":"we had been to this place before & the food quality was good. Just went for lunch today & had horrible experience. the cook cum server is very unprofessional. the food quality is also gotten worst. Gives a bad name to the Indian restaurant. Never going back."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the Bay Leaf Cafe. There are very few Indian restaurants in Phoenix,  so I am very glad to have found this restaurant. The food is amazing, the chicken is tender and soft,  and sautéed in delicious sauces. The staff is also very friendly and eager to help. Overall a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Family owned and operated business.  The son is such a nice kid!  We always enjoy chatting with them.  The food is amazing.  We love Indian food and are pretty picky about it.  It is fast and pretty reasonably priced.  The food tastes fresh, and the chef is sometimes willing to do special orders for my picky husband.  I personally love the plain naan and the chicken curry.  They have a huge menu though, try everything!"}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant was a bit below average.  I ordered Vegetable Samosas, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Garlic Naan.  The samosas were a bit overdone...boderline burnt.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was a bit bland with very little taste.  The naan was pretty good.  The staff provided good service.  I might give this restaurant another chance."}
{"text":"I have tried a lot of Indian restaurants but by far bay leaf is my favorite. The lamb curry and kadhai chicken from MAQSOOD Bhai is very delicious. Also service from JOBAN is outstanding. We love this place and go very often and always get nice service and food. Hope things remain the same unlike other food places...."}
{"text":"Tried some good stuff here. The sizzlers are very nice. Paneer sizzler and chicken sizzler. The place is very clean and well maintained. But it's too bright and feels like we can see too much of everyone around. The recess lighting can be off and that would make it cozy with their other light feature and chandelier. The owner is a friendly person and took personal care when the waiter took a wrong order. The mango kulfi didn't taste anything like it should. And the chicken in the chicken tikka curry felt more like rubber (old frozen ). They seem to be trying hard which is a good thing. But need some expert touches here and there to become better."}
{"text":"Great Friendly Service! The owner was very helpful and guided us to order what we were looking for! Overall Delicious food! We ordered some Roti with a cauliflower and a chick pea dish. It was all Spiced perfectly... Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place so much, I went back the next evening to pick up Afghan Chicken and Bay Leaf Cikken Tikka to grill for my party. Waiter was great. Chef was cordial. Only thing I would advise the owner is to be ready for more in house diners as the reviews continue to mount. I have found my Indian food mainstay."}
{"text":"We've been meaning to try this place many times and eventually got to to it a few weeks ago, only to find it was closed for renovations. So we tried again last week.  It was quiet, but we were early.  The owners were very friendly and helped us choose a few items.  We started off with the Samosas and Onion Pakora. Both delicious, but the Samosas were the star.  In hind sight 1 order of Samosas is enough for 2 as an appetizer, the owner warned us, and he was right. Next we had our entrees which consists of a veggie korma for my wife, goat biryanni for me and an afghani boti kobab to share accompanied with rice and garlic naan. Everything came out hot and perfectly cooked. Portions are just right, but with our large appetizer we did have to take a few bits home. All in all, really enjoyed the meal, food was good, owners inviting and made us feel at ease. Will be going back."}
{"text":"I am a hard guy to impress but the food here was so tasty that I was impressed instantly. I like non vegetarian food so had ordered fish curry and chilly chicken. Both dishes turned out to be fantastic! I can say that the quantity was a bit inadequate but the quality of the food certainly made up for that.   I would recommend this restaurant any day."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly and helpful suggestions. Staff provided great choices for all of our different taste buds. Food was flavorful, delicious, and we loved the fresh ingredients. My husband was able to enjoy Indian food for the first time :)    Great for vegetarians.   We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food. One of the best Indian Cuisine restaurants I have eaten at since I have been in Arizona. Everyone was very friendly. We were seated and waited on immediately.  Vegetables Samos's were flaky and had a wonderful taste. Paneer Tikka Masala was spiced perfectly. Do not forget to order the Naan! My husband had the Lamb Kofta Curry, he said it was very good. We will definitely be back.  Side note: The restaurant was clean. I could see the food being cooked fresh."}
{"text":"this neighborhood bistro could just as easily be found in Scottsdale, Tempe, or any trendy locale... and probably should be. they offer sumptuous fare at great prices from a fun and friendly staff that make dining in a pleasure or carry out a breeze.  the curry dishes are simply amazing and what I continue to get. loved it!"}
{"text":"We recently moved from the Bay Area and were so glad to find this Indian Café. The food is made fresh daily by Chef Maqsood and served professionally by Jobhan. The taste is fresh, flavorful and spiced to your request. The Rice bowl is a great deal and they have goat on the lunch and dinner menu. They have some of the best Samosa I've tasted. It's been a pleasure to find this gem of an Indian Café so close to our new residence. We eat there at least once a week. Keep up the good work and delicious meals guys!"}
{"text":"we have taken multiple take outs past 6 months and food is tasting so much better! Keep it up Bay Leaf Cafe!"}
{"text":"Try Nandini in Tempe. I don't like to leave reviews unless they are positive or at least constructive but in this case this restaurant deserves the poor review I'm about to leave.  First, the silverware was not very clean as it was quite spotty,  neither were the water glasses. The apathetic waitress /co-owner not only did not welcome us but she did not bring enough menus over when she got around to coming out from behind the counter, she did not offer a beverage and she was VERY slow as if she really, really wanted to leave which she did part way through our service.  She also did not ensure we had silverware so we had to walk around and rob two other tables to get some as did a larger party who was dining a few tables away.  What was the most disappointing was that I ordered the Bay Leaf Platter which was a sampler of many of their more popular dishes. Chicken Tikka was one of the times advertised in the description  however when I pointed out that it was missing the waitress pointed to the red chicken and said that was it. I responded by telling her she just told me moments ago that it was Chicken Boti-which it was. I challenged her and told her it did not look like Tikka and that she just said it was Boti. She said she misspoke and pointed to another item and said THAT was the Boti. Again, total BS.  After she left I called another young waitress over and asked if it was Tikka, she confirmed it was not and then called the owner/chef over. He said Boti is \"like\" Tikka so they did not bother to put the Tikka on my platter even though it is advertised as part of the meal and the first waitress said Tikka was on the platter. Bear on mind this was now near the end of the meal and he kind of offered to bring me the Tikka but in a very discouraging manner saying there was no point. Yes he said that. Please let me add that I had Paneer Tikka Masala for lunch with a friend at her home and I am also very familiar with Indian food. I felt so insulted that they lied to such extent assuming I'm just an ignorant American who won't know the difference. Let me also tell you that Boti is nothing like Tikka. They man also continued on with his lying over the items on the platter but I gave up and decided it was a worthless argument, I just wont go back. Their integrity is lacking, they have no pride for the products they execute, they insult the intelligence of their customers and the rest of the food was below mediocre.  One more thing, the platter was supposed to include a salad and chutney. They called a corner of dried out cucumbers \"salad\" and the chutney never came. AWFUL!!!! I'd also like to add that the owner's response was full of fallacies, there were no calls made ahead and as far as the coupon, we only had one which was not even mentioned until our check came and by that time the horrible waitress/owner had already left. I also think when a business chooses a rebuttal which is unwise to begin with it should appear professional and without pettiness and false information. This woman is clearly attempting to discredit me and my review. We were a party of four and all of us had the same thoughts on the experience.  And yes I was lied to and told very different things based on who I asked. It was ridiculous. I paid my bill and left a tip. Just not going back."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! This is a hidden gem! We ordered takeout.  1: Vegetable samosas: 2 per order. Came with mint and tamarind chutneys. Delicious. Crispy, tender, great seasoning. 2: Chole bhature: my personal fav is always chole, and this is excellent. Came with 2 (not one!) bhature to scoop up all the delicious juiciness. 3: Bay Leaf Chicken Tikka: my husband said that this was the best chicken dish he had eaten all year! (And he's a very particular/picky eater!) 4:Palak Paneer: beautiful emerald green goodness with just enough paneer.  5: Naan: perfect! 6: Basmati rice: fragrant, fluffy. 7: mango lassi: sweet, tart, ice cold.   So much food, we have enough left for either another dinner or 3-4 lunches (if I can stay out of the fridge tonight!) everything was perfect spice, nothing mouth-numbing. Staff was very friendly, takeout was very carefully packed.  We will definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"In a sea of taco shops the Bay Leaf Cafe is like a lighthouse of dining adventure. This was my first visit to an Indian restaurant and I loved it. Our server Jobi was friendly and helpful and navigated our way through uncharted waters. The vegetable samosas, a pastry wrapped appetizer, was flakey and delicious. Chicken tikka masala is outstanding. Be sure to order naan bread right from the oven to dip up every bit of the rich tomato gravy. Our meal at the Bay Leaf Cafe was a culinary adventure and a dining success! Look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala, Garlic Naan, and Samosa Chaat. The Paneer Tikka Masala was creamy but a bit too spicy for me (not enough Paneer as well). The Garlic Naan was deliciously garlicky and toasted quite nicely. The worst was the Samosa Chaat, it was soggy and tasted odd...  Overall, probably would be coming back to Bay Leaf Cafe unless I'm REALLY craving Indian food and no other Indian places are open."}
{"text":"Not much into writing reviews but this place definitely deserves one :-). Tried their chicken tikka, goat curry and naan...Excellent food both in taste and quality. Will definitely be going there often as this is the best Indian food I have come across in AZ in last 8 years. Hope they keep serving the same level of good food!!"}
{"text":"Maybe they got off to a rocky start, but their service is now great, sparkly dishes, and nice linen napkins. we are a fan of their food--particularly the rice bowl which is enough for two adults to share. The sizzling tandoori chicken is super and was presented truly sizzling on a wooden platter. A great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing!! The rice bowl with a sample of 6 different entries!! Wonderful taste and Super great flavors!! The garlic Naan bread is so nummy! I would defiantly recommend this to everyone!!"}
{"text":"We had channa bathura and palak paneer here this Thursday evening , the food was really good , very fresh and yummy and the service was great too , food arrived very promptly , it was a good dinner evening"}
{"text":"We have been looking for a Indian restaurant and this Is one is our favorite hands down! It's a small, very cute little restuarant with delicious food. I had the Chicken Korma and it was amazing! The cilantro gave it an excellent flavor. My mother in law ordered  the grilled talapia and that was also excellent. It was crunchy on the outside, but incredibly tender on the inside. The owner was very accommodating and very nice throughout the evening. Excellent service! This is now our go to spot for Indian food!"}
{"text":"First time.. Ordered Malai Kofta and Chicken Maharaja today to take home.  Taste wise , cooked very nice.. had enough spice (we ordered extra spicy).. The Kofta balls ingredients were good.. I ate two and one was cooked perfect and other wasnt so good..But you could feel the ingredients were mixed right. Sauce was rich and cooked nice.. My biggest complaint, for people like me, Bay Leaf , pls increase the quantity.. What you gave was so little that I will hesitate coming there next time when I am hungry..  Nutshell : Quality was good. Quantity was very little.. Update on 09/02/2012 We have bought to go many times here now.. Quantity has improved a bit.. I feel the best Indian food you can get in Chandler. I have increased it to 4 star"}
{"text":"Very tasty non-veg dishes. Try their kababs (specially the Chapli & the Afghani Kababs), the Kadhai dishes, the biriyanis & the koftas."}
{"text":"Today for lunch I picked biryani chicken and veg both ! Hats off to the chef  Will say this is indeed one of the best Biryani I have had I. A long long time"}
{"text":"received lousy service when we went there the second time.. and some very surprising and shocking replies and comments.."}
{"text":"First, the good things.  The Chili Chicken is awesome.  My wife and I both love it as it is spiced well and different than what we have had at other restaurants.  The Nan was also fluffy and not greasy. The Peas Palau was also unique with fruit and nuts.   Now the challenges.  I have been here several times and although they say Dosa on the online  menu and also on some signs in the restaurant, I have yet to be there when they can actually serve it. The beans in the Chana Masala were undercooked both times we ordered it.  They also don't make Dall.  What Indian restaurant doesn't make Dal?  Still too early to give them 2 stars but hope they get consistent on what they can serve."}
{"text":"My first time going to Bay Leaf, and my first time writing a Yelp review - I shared the Bay Leaf Cafe 'Mixed Grill' with a friend, and it was just fantastic.  I can't help but wonder why business was so slow during prime dinner hours of a Friday night.  Friendly staff and pleasant environment, and so many more dishes I'm itching to try.  I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I placed an order for take away from here and was disappointed in the flavor... there's hardly any seasoning and definitely no spicy kick, which is what you seek from traditional Indian food.  However, the man that put my order was so nice and was very friendly, with a great smile - and that's what will bring me back to try more..."}
{"text":"We recently moved to this neighborhood and was looking for some real Indian food. My husband was a big fan of Zam Zam which into renovation and was closed for a while, he loved biryani there. So we were looking for change now. We entered this cafe by chance and while talking to the chef we realized that it's the same zam zam chef. We are so happy to find him.  Food tastes awesome!! Been there twice in a week already. Chef Maqsood makes fresh food and Joban serves with all the heart. Perfect place for a change :) must go !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I got take out from here for the first time.  Y-U-M-M-Y!  This will be our go to place for Indian food from now on!!!  Everything was declicous!!!!   I really wanted Chicken Korma and they only have Lamb Korma on the menu but we asked if they could make it and they said no problem.  Melt in your mouth delicouness with crazy-good flavor!!  My husband had vegetable samosas and alugobi.  He was loving both of his selections and said he would get them both again.  We each got an order of paratha and dipping that in the Korma sauce has left us wanting more!  Thank you, Bay Leaf Cafe!  Please keep up the quality, freshness, and flavor of your food.  You've hooked us!!  :-)"}
{"text":"A little hidden gem in South Chandler.   I haven't had the pleasure of dining in so this will be based solely on take out orders.   I have ordered take out quite a few times so feel it is time to review this place.    Service: each time I've ordered they are always friendly over the phone and the first time where eager to answer any questions I had about the menu.  My order has always been correct and hot n fresh. No issue here!!!   Food: I've had the Tandoori Chicken and the Chicken Tiki Masala. Both of these are absolutely outstanding.  I want to order something different each time, but can't bring myself since these are so dang delicious. I don't have much experience with Indian food, but the few places I've had this place is excellent. Great flavor. And the naan bread is made fresh as well. I recommend the Garlic Naan. Yummo!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday around 1:15 to get a meal to-go. There was not a single person in the place. We ordered the vegetable pakoras, tandoori chicken, and chicken tikka masala to go.   We waited ~45 minutes for the food, which felt excessive.  No one in the restaurant, and that kind of a wait for two meals and an appetizer? Really?  The story doesn't end there. We got the food back and started eating. A red bell pepper garnish with the pakoras tasted off and then we came across a green bell pepper with mold on it. How can the rest of the meal be trusted at that point?   This place missed the mark today and we will not be going back. Be wary of the food quality should you decide to go."}
{"text":"We ordered catering from Bay Leaf Cafe, and it turned out great! There was a mistake in the order, which they made sure to correct immediately. I'm very picky about Indian food, but I really enjoyed the food. I recommend ordering the Kebobs we had the chicken sheesh kebobs as part of the order, and they were everyone's favorite! The food was not overly spicy, so if you like your food to be very spicy will have to specify."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely terrible. We had a groupon, so got stuck with ordering more than one dish. The cook and the janitor were doubling as the the waiter. The \"cook\" came out with his apron to take our order. That should have a sign to run to the exit, but we stayed since this was out first time there. We ordered the bay leaf tikka, the mutton biryani and the chicken tikka masala. All were terrible. The rice was under cooked and it looked like they had sprinkled on some of the spices right at the end. The other dishes were over spiced with \"heingh\" which made it uneatable. We  have tried several places around the valley and this is at the bottom of the pile. Sad to see all the effort to make the place look nice, but the food is less than desirable :-(. Our first and last visit."}
{"text":"A nice, quaint little local place.  The food is very authentic although the menu is quite limited compared to most Indian restaurants I've been to.  Of the dishes we've tried we like the chicken Tikka Massala the best.  The Lamb Curry is pretty good too.  It's not on the menu but the chef made me some Lamb Vindaloo and it was great.  Their Garlic Naan is OK but inconsistent."}
{"text":"I've lived up the road for 5 years and went to the Bay Leaf Cafe for the first time. I've always waited as I heard reviews that weren't selling me on the place. Well, I'm not happy I went. The Samosa was easily the worst I've ever had. I've probably eaten at 100 Indian restaurants in my life. I know Indian food. I love Indian food and eat it all the time.  Trust me, if you know Indian food, you'll know the food I got wasn't quality.  The naan was below average. The main courses I got were not good either. Edible just not real good. One had a decent flavor but the other entree was way below par. Ultimately though, my meal began with the Samosa, of which I threw out one of the two they gave me. It's too bad as I wanted to like this place so bad as there is no other options in this part of south Chandler.  Oh well. Worth it to drive elsewhere.  I just read all the positive reviews. I can only imagine that either (1) I got them on a bad night or (2) the people reviewing have no real idea of what true authentic Indian food is. I'm from CA and this place would go out of business in a week there."}
{"text":"Our first visit and it won't be the last. Delicious flavor in all the dishes we tried and we are vegan so it was great that they were so accommodating to our needs. Best customer service of any restaurant, we didn't want for a thing."}
{"text":"Had been craving Indian Food for a couple weeks. This place did ok with fulfilling my fix. What i enjoyed was the friendly service. It's a Sunday evening and hubby and I found the $10 for $15 deal on yelp and decided to give it a try. We were the only ones in the place so the young lady was able to give us her undivided attention. She explained the dishes i was curious about and actually offered up a couple samples. I absolutely loved the chicken sheesh kabob that she highly recommended. I asked for spicy and it was! It's minced chicken w green chili and Indian spices rolled into a shape of a sausage. Not on a stick. We also tried the Chicken Boti and the Chicken tikka Marsala (we like chicken) those were good just not as spicy as I like it to be. We plan to return to try the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"This used to be a nice place. But they constantly change chefs and now the person who serves, also cooks! At least that's what happened to us. The food is never consistent. If they make gulab jamoons hard and too sweet, they'll say someone ordered it that way and they are serving you leftovers from the catering order(yes, we were told that). But that's not we stopped going there.... we found soap sediments in our glasses, we kept finding hair in our curries and the last time we went there, we found an insect in our curry. Very unhygienic. I used to go there almost everyday, but avoid it now."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and looks like a newly built place. The customer service was excellent. The kid in glasses is a pimp.  Now the food...i hate doing this but it is not on par with other indian restaraunts. I had the goat biryani....jad it spicy...be warned it is a tummy twister. The chicken curry could have being better. The naan was burnt....not good.  So if you do eat the spicy food...to alleviate the pain...eat some Belgium chocolate."}
{"text":"So very impressed with my experience last night.   The manager was very nice,  food was some of the best Indian I have had in a long time.  I will be inviting friends."}
{"text":"Menu is pretty limited, but I was in the mood for a Chicken Tikka Masala which they had, so that worked out. I must say, it was one of the best I've had in years. Accompanied by Basmati rice (included) and a Naan bread, I was more than full by the end of it. If I was to change anything, I'd serve a slightly thicker sauce and maybe a little less of it. They could also benefit by a few more items on the menu to chose from.  I will definitely go back. Next time I think I'll give the lamb curry a try."}
{"text":"Recipes are not consistent. Couldn't rely on food taste it changes every visit. Sometimes it's amazing and yesterday it was not so good."}
{"text":"Ordered to go.  Had chicken tikka and saag paneer, nan and rice pudding.  For the most part it was good although the saag paneer was pureed to the to the point it had the consistency of cream (albeit green).  It wasn't bad, but it would have been nice had it been a little more identifiable as spinach.  I also wanted raita with the order and I was pretty sure I asked for it, I'm just not sure the guy understood what I wanted.  Overall, good but I would have liked to have gotten my raita."}
{"text":"Food was presented very well, and I have never had such authentic and high quality indian food in a long time!  Garlic naan was super soft and delicious! Joban was our server, very quick, courteous and good service.  Maqsood bhai was the chef, and he was very courteous and took out time to talk to us and made our experience very pleasurable. Beautiful ambience in white and green,  this place is a must go to for authentic indian food!"}
{"text":"Everyone was friendly when I came in, very helpful. I got a $5.99 rice bowl which is a great option for those with small stomachs. I love Indian food but post wls it fills me up faster than any other food. Buffets are a waste because I can't eat much at a time. The rice bowl was perfect. It gave me some variety without being overwhelming and was fine for me to take my leftovers home. The food was tasty and the mango lassi was fresh and huge. The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. Would definitely come back."}
