{"text":"Used to come here every other week while I was growing up. Very good food for cheap. Plus side I never got sick from the food, which is strange from a Chinese buffet. Not much variety but what they had tasted good. If anyone knows where or what happened to them it would be of good to know."}
{"text":"Gal from work turned me onto this no-nonsense buffet. Seedy on the neighbor outside but clean and startling pink walls and 1960's curtain beads once you walk in. went with girlfriends from work for a quick all-u-can fill up styro container from the all you can eat buffet.  The place was crowded for lunch (that's a good sign) with a buffet being replenished frequently in our short 10 minutes there.  I'm a spice junkie so i have to say i was a little disappointed in the variety.  they served noodles, fried chicken (crispy, fresh, but not spicy), egg foo young, salad with noodles, sweet & sour chicken, veggies, and soup which apparently doesn't come with the takeout styro container.  Sweet and sour sauce was good, freshly made.  all in all, worth the 5 bucks for a solid, but non-spicy bufet you can order and eat in a short lunch break. +1 for being very clean!"}
{"text":"I need to know where they moved to, it's been to long....everytime I pass by the mariscos place I say, i hate you and I'm Mexican! Anyone that ever ate here will understand. I miss my favorite food. I need to where they've gone. help this is a food emergency."}
{"text":"Awesome. Best chicken wings in town. Crispy on the outside juicy on the inside :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to this place for about 13 years.  We strangely love this little hole in the wall chinese buffet.  The food comes out fresh and its cheap 2, about $5 pp.  We r strangely addicted to this place even though we think its dingy and it could use some cleaning, we just keep coming back.  We have surprisingly never gotten sick from eating here.  We have gotten most of our family and friends addicted also.  We have even become friends with the owners son, which BTW works here.  we love it and as long as they r open we'll keep coming back."}
