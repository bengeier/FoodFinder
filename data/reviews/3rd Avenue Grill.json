{"text":"Attended a Paint Nite event held in restaurant within the Marriott. Staff was super friendly & welcoming. They were patient with us & very complimentary. Waitress was familiar with craft beers avail & suggested one I'd never tried. Loved it! Chicken skewers were fresh, hot, juicy & full of flavor. Chipotle sauce was so good! I'd go back for this. Hummus was good."}
{"text":"I've been going here for over a month now and usually I have a good experience. The food is okay and the service had been above average. I would rate this place a 3-4 start prior to today's experience. Today, I arrived here at 12:10pm and no one was there. I am literally talking \"NO ONE\".  I had a free lunch card because I purchased 4 lunches from their special lunch menu. I had a small request of a tortilla soup instead of the tomato soup. I have literally asked for this every Thursday for the last month. I know its typically not an issue. Today, the lady looks puzzled and finally agreed. I then sat while she figured out the computer input system. I couldn't believe how hard it was for her. I do understand new employees may not know the system but I've seen that lady there before. There really shouldn't have been an issue. I ordered the Grilled Cheese and Tortilla Soup with a Side of Fries to go! Another gentleman sat right next to me and ordered a salad with a few special request as well. The gentleman next to me showed up 10 mins after me. He stepped away from the bar were we ordered and was gone for less than 5 mins and his food was ready to go. Most people would say, \"A salad is quicker than a grilled cheese\" I would normally agree but he had added chicken. To me chicken takes longer to than putting a piece of bread on a skillet and heating it. So I waited and waited. Finally at around 30+mins of being there, I inform them that I need to go back to work. They said 5 seconds they are just bagging up the food. Those 5 seconds was really 5 minutes. I was fed up at this point but held it together. I asked for hot sauce to go. They said they couldn't put some in a little container for me to take. I know they can because I've done it. WHY NOT TODAY???  I also requested that I get ranch sauce with my fries, they put ketchup. Not only did they mess up my order and deny me hot sauce, they took an abnormal amount of time to do a basic choice. They also took better care of a customer that showed up after me. I would have honestly understood it better if the guy next to me was also waiting. There was nobody there and they took this long. They couldn't find lids for the soup, the grilled cheese tasted different. I dont know what happened to the usual guy but he did an amazing job. That is the only reason I didn't give them a 1 star review. Normally they would be a 3 start with okay food and great service. Now I see them as a 2 star with poor food and poor service. I hope management reads this an takes action to fix this. I used to recommend this place and now I refuse to because of the poor service! Please understand that for every bad review I write, I like to write 2 positive ones. I hate writing bad reviews but people need to be aware of bad service and bad food."}
{"text":"Located inside the Marriott, this is a great spot to fuel up after a night of heavy drinking and motor-boating. I give 3 stars simply for convenience. Although their $20 breakfast buffet is pretty satisfying for anyone needing their fill of breakfast meat in the AM, I could just as well buy a dozen or so sausage biscuits at Mickey D's down the street and be completely satisfied."}
