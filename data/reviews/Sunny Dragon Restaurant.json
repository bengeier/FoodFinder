{"text":"When you come here when it's not too busy, it's a fantastic experience. Delicious food, good service, decent prices and plaza lot parking! I personally wouldn't stray from the surefire Korean-Chinese menu items like jjajangmyun, jjamppong, tangsooyuk, kkanpoongi, rajogi, etc. but they do offer a bunch of other rice and noodle dishes for the more adventurous (though they are hit and miss, as to be expected). 

When the place IS busy however, the service goes way downhill. Multiple times I've been seated after a long wait only to be completely ignored (sometimes even after asking to order) until a server waiting on the adjacent table notices our empty table and hurries over. Food is slow to come out, the side radishes/onions often don't show up and tea/water is never refilled. I think declining quality of service relative to busyness is true for most restaurants and is honestly to be expected, but Sunny Dragon seems to manage it poorer than most."}
{"text":"Get their Ggampoongi Shrimp! AMAZINGGGGGGGGGG. I go there to eat just that and Jjajjangmyun."}
{"text":"If you're not familiar with Korean-Chinese cuisine, you're in the right place.

When you first arrive, you are given a hot pot of tea and their menus. You can ask for water as well, but we like our tea so we usually don't. On one side of the table, you can find the restaurant's combo special sign, offering a huge variety of prix fixe for large parties. At Sunny Dragon, the portions are very big, so even the smallest Combo A would probably be enough for 4 (than their recommended 2-3 people).

After you order, you are given a mixed plate of side dishes. In Korean-Chinese cuisine, there are 3 essential side dishes: pickled radish, kimchi, and raw onions with black bean paste. The white vinegar given on the side of the table can be poured over the pickled radish and onions to enhance their flavours. This is totally optional and is personal preference.

Sunny Dragon also has a great lunch special menu for a very affordable price. If you're in the area for a great tasting lunch, you can definitely count this place in.

As for our menu, we now have a set menu that we order since we've been here many times.
We always get the kkan-pun-sae-u (sweet and spicy shrimps) and another main dish (usually noodles) to share. 

Kkan-pun-sae-u:
At Sunny Dragon, the shrimp they use in this dish is huge! That is, they use the king sized shrimps and not the small ones. It is really worth your money. The tempura batter on the shrimps are so crisp and the sauce is drool-worthy. It is not that spicy on our palates, and more on the side of sweet and sour. We love this dish so much that we get it every time we go to Sunny Dragon. There are not only shrimp but a variety of vegetables and pineapple as well! The pineapple really gives the dish its sweet and sour flavour and I manage to find them all and put them in my belly. 

Fried Jjam-ppon:
This was kind of an adventure foodie experience for us because we didn't know what it looked like, or how it would taste. Like, how is a spicy noodle soup dish fried?? But, it truly was a good idea to try this. The taste was almost exactly how the original jjam-ppong would taste, except with less soup! I was in love. You see, I love eating jjam-ppong, but I didn't particularly like the soup part of it. This was the perfect solution dish for me! The dish had a hearty portion of noodles in it, with Chinese bok-choy, seafood (squid and shrimp), and other vegetables.

Family Jja-jang:
This dish can be ordered for one person, two people, or up to a party of five. The story behind this dish goes a bit like this. Traditionally, the jja-jang-myun is freshly cooked noodles with the black bean sauce poured over it. It is then taken to the customer, who mixes the noodles and sauce together oneself. This dish, the family jja-jang, comes out already mixed by the chef, and also with the addition of seafood and other vegetables not usually seen in the traditional version. As there are other seafood and vegetables in the dish, the noodles and sauce are cooked together by the chef once more. The family part of the dish originates from the fact that this dish can be shared, bringing the family together over their meal. This is also why you can order this dish for up to five people. On our visit, we tried this popular dish and ordered the one portion of it. We asked the waiter who was taking our order beforehand how big the portions are, and he honestly told us that the one portion would be enough for us to share since we were ordering the sweet and spicy shrimp anyways. And he was definitely right! The dish was exactly enough for us to share, and priced below $10, just like the fried jjam-ppong was.

All in all, this family restaurant is a hit go-to place especially during the weekend. You will find the place packed with Koreans and other Canadians alike. We highly recommend this restaurant! You could probably call ahead and make a reservation if you want."}
{"text":"Ohh goodness me, the Ja Jang Myeon (wheat noodles with black soybean paste) is HEAVENLY! After watching sooo many Korean Dramas and seeing all the actors/actresses eating this dish, I was finally able to taste it for myself and it was the most delicious bowl of noodles I have ever eaten! With such a unique taste and texture I basically gobbled and slurped my way down to the very last noodle. 
With the restaurant having such a family-oriented business feeling to it, it really felt like I was enjoying a home-cooked Korean meal.
Fantastic!"}
{"text":"The food is decent price and pretty good. I give it a 2 because of their service. We found hair embedded inside one of their fried dishes and the lady gave us a couple of drinks and then told us to still pay for the dish....Would you eat and pay for a dish that had hair? Their service i give it a zero cus she even argued with us for a good five minutes on how we still had to pay. We ended up paying and leaving unhappy. The old owner before the chef bought the store over was much nicer. She definitely had more customer service before she retired. I think since the chef bought the store over lacks service in numerous ways. The food itself is pretty good. Just be careful."}
{"text":"Came here on a friday night & was seated immediately since it wasn't busy. I had the sweet and spicy chicken, and bulgogi. I liked the chicken, but I found the bulgogi tasted too much like ginger. Maybe I'll try the Jajangmyeon next time. The customer service was friendly. However, what I found really lacking was their decor. The tables and overall appearance looked worn down"}
{"text":"This place actually tastes good. Even for me who was born and raised in Korea.
It's very hard to find places that actually tastes Korean here.
Their sweet and sour pork, ggam poongi, and jjajangmen are heavenly.
The downside of this place is the amount of MSG in their food. I'm very sensitive to msg, I get very sleepy and thirsty after having them. 
I know that a lot of Asian places use them but nothing makes me as sleepy as the food here. You shouldn't eat too much of this stuff. 
Also, they have a poor service. I used to work nearby, my co-workers had been loyal customers over five years ordering at least twice a month. We catered several times on birthdays too. The workers don't give a damn, no friendly greetings or anything when they see us.That's why it is a three star place. Not the right place to eat out often, maybe occasionally."}
{"text":"Grabbed take-out from this restaurant today for jang jang myun and fried dumplings! Awesome portions and it really satisfied my cravings."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my regulars. I went to Sunny Dragon after returning from Iiving in another city after almost a year, only to find out they are a lot better than before. I asked the staff and found out it's under new management now. Better and delicious food! Kudos!"}
{"text":"so.............. disappointed. very very small portion. typically fried rice. just few carrot and cabbage. not even worth $3.00. was my favorite korean chinese restaurnt. no more. no more no more. people nowadays are not cheap. rasie the price and provide good food."}
{"text":"Sunny Dragon in one word: inconsistent. 

Don't get me wrong, Sunny Dragon is one of my go-to restaurants and their food is usually great. The food they serve here is even better than the Korean-Chinese food I've had in Korea, at least in my opinion. However, I have to point out that the quality of the food is very inconsistent - somedays the food is amazing, other days it is very disappointing (which was the case for my last visit). 

My regular order is sweet and sour pork with jjamppong (noodles in spicy broth with veggie and seafood toppings). Usually the food is great - the sweet and sour pork has a lot of meat, and the jjamppong broth is very rich and flavourful. Unfortunately, my last visit didn't live up to expectations. The sweet and sour pork had very little meat in it and several of the pieces consisted only of fried dough. The jjamppong was also disappointing as the broth did not have its usual richness and the noodles felt slightly undercooked.

Regardless, I will definitely continue coming here because on the good days, the food is honestly fantastic. It's unfortunate that the food quality/taste is so inconsistent or else I would not hesitate to give Sunny Dragon 5 stars. If you've had a bad first impression, it's definitely worth giving it a second chance!

Menu recommendations: 
- sweet and sour pork
- spicy chicken
- jjamppong (noodles in spicy broth)
- jajangmyeon (noodles in black soybean paste with diced pork and veggies)"}
{"text":"I went after the peak lunch hour and had a kanjajangmyun. The waitress told me to have a seat and she never came back to bring the menu. As i knew what i wanted i just ordered the meal. Jajangmyun was delicious and the sauce was fresh. however no service at all! I will not go back to this resto but go to another one down the street on Steeles ave for korean-chinese food."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant for a long time!! This is like the best place for korean style chinese food restaurant so far.  Jajangmyun is pretty good and all the other dishes like tangsooyook, kanpoonggi, gochoojapchae are pretty good. Although i still think you have to go to korea for the best jajangmyun."}
{"text":"I love this place especially the Jja jang myun here is amazing.  I been to Sunny Dragon a few times now after my Korean friend recommended this place to me.  The staff is always friendly and helpful as well.  It is best to have a friend that can read Korean here as they have some menus only in Korean.  They have specials buy 2 get 1 free or something but it was only in Korean so I wasn't too sure.  We ordered the Kang poong gi as well and it was very good and the Tang soo yook was very good too.  Those are our regular dishes here at Sunny Dragon.  The portion is big and quality is very good.  We usually go in a huge group and the server gives us free pop which is very nice of them.  It can be a little imitating coming here if you are not familiar with Korean food as they seems to cater toward Koreans mostly.  The place itself looks outdated and not that big - it won't wow you to make you come here if you see it; but don't judge a book by its cover.  They do have booths and a big room where we usually get put into since we have a group that is 10 people.  I am looking toward my next visit to Sunny Dragon already.

{"text":"The original ja jjang myun and champong restaurant. The kam poongi is pretty good here too. The restaurant has been around for years so that speaks volumes. 

Lots of parking which is always good!"}
{"text":"Really great Chinese-Korean family style restaurant! The portions here are HUGE but the food can sometimes be hit or miss.

We ordered the combo special A-1 that consisted of kan pung ki (sweet and sour pork), tang su yuk (lemon pork), and jajangmyeon (black bean noodles). All of the portions were massive. The pork dishes were small sizes but were still mountains of food--about the amount of 2 university textbooks or 1 med school textbook. The jajangmyeon was family sized and it was no joke--probably enough for a family of 5 as a whole meal, with no other dishes. 
The kan pung ki has lots of sauce on it, really making you crave some rice to calm the flavour. It was mildly crunchy like it wasn't quite fresh. The pork was also covered in quite a bit of breading as well. 
The tang su yuk was a lot more mild in flavour--especially when compared to the kan pung ki. There was also a lot of breading on the pork but the sheer quantity of food probably made up for that.
The jajangmyeon here is my favourite! I love noodles and this is a must every time I come here. It's very savory but sweet and has a lot of the amazing sauce.

Overall great place. Sometimes you get crunchy pork, sometimes not, it may have to do with the time of day you come. We came here pretty late at night so perhaps they couldn't be bothered to whip up a new batch. I've come here in the past and the meat was crunchier. The jajangmyeon never lets me down though, so it's a pretty safe bet!"}
{"text":"Been there a few times and it's been good for me.
Menus are standard but decent choices."}
{"text":"If you want some Korean styled Chinese food around North York, this is the place to be.
Their jja jang myun is the best I've had outside Korea.They don't have the lowest prices in town but you can't cheap out on food like this(not that it's really expensive or anything)
They also have specials on main dishes (order 2?3? and get 1 free).
I just wish they'd close a bit later though.11pm is too early in my opinion."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm spoiled with the Korean food in Southern California, but this place was not that good.

I had the katsu and my sister had the jjambbong.

What else can I really say? I mean, I fly in from Southern California to Toronto to visit family and all they want is Korean food.

Sigh, I guess I am spoiled with the food here. Sorry, this place just can't compare with the restaurants out here."}
{"text":"I've been a loyal customer for probably most of my life to this restaurant ever since i was little ! I live pretty close by so i go their often for lunch when i'm to lazy to cook for myself or i go when my family wants to go as well.

I suggest going with a group but going with a group or family around peak hours (lunch and dinner) as it may feel a little awkward eating alone but out side of that its pretty quiet there.

I really enjoy the service as the waitresses are very friendly, food portions are pretty huge and tastes great. prices seem pretty fair and if you bring friends to split the bills on side dishes its even better!

My favourite thing to get is the Jajang myun (black bean noodles) tang soo yuuk (sweet and salty sauce on deep fried pork strips)  split bowls. they have combo deals with sides and main dishes for groups and stuff also so i suggest that when you in groups! They also do take out so you can bring the food home and eat it! 

On weekends it gets pretty backed so i suggest you make reservations if possible also, so if you plan on eating and want it to be quiet i suggest you avoid weekends and just order takeout!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Korean food in an un-reviewed location that my fiancee has been eating at for the past 10 years of her life. Run by a small family this quaint little spot has always hit the spot with every dish we've ordered, with the exception of their spicy soup which she says must have been made by someone different because it didn't have its \"Zing\". The servers are all pretty good at negotiating with you what you want. The language barrier is a minor hindrance, but most of the time if you give them just the extra few seconds they will figure out what you're aiming for. The portions are huge and are served family style, so if you are interested in trying a bunch of different foods take a group of friends and each order something to share. The noodle bowls have a lot of sauces and they even give you scissors to help cut through things. (If you're into doing that) We've always been too full to try any of the desserts they have here, but I can only imagine they would be excellent if they are any reflections of their dinner dishes. If you like Korean, give this place a shot"}
{"text":"Updating yet again after my last trip there had a very disappointing experience, and so I was forced to drop my rating again.  As usual I ordered the jajangmyun, Mandoo, and kampoonggi.  As we are sitting and waiting I start to realize that my eyes are burning and watering significantly.  At first I chalked it up to being tired, but than my partner said that his eyes were burning as well.  As we looked around we noticed that everyone was having issues.  I asked the waitress what was going on and was told that they were peeling onions and there was nothing they could do.  Unfortunately this made the experience of eating in a terrible experience.  We basically just wanted to eat our food and get out of there as our eyes were burning beyond belief.  We ended up packing most of it up and just leaving.  It was a very disappointing experience to say the least."}
{"text":"yesterday i ordered fried kimchi, pork, steam rice to go. when i got home, its totally vegie, no pork at all. So sad! Service is bad, but food is okay. Korean Chinese food."}
{"text":"Sunny Dragon offers the best Korean-Chinese style dishes in the city. 
I tried couple other restaurants previously and their location/interior may not be the best but the food is just on point. 
With generous portion and great prices, don't think I can say more.
Definitely recommend \"Jjambbong.\" It's a noodle soup with seafood and veggies. 
*Spicy but it's worth the sweat!!"}
{"text":"Sunny Dragon is a nice transitional restaurant for those who have eaten Chinese food and want a segway into a part of the wide selection of Korean food.

Every order comes with a small plate of their bonchon. Very simple, yellow radish, sliced raw onion, Kimchi, and black bean paste. It's recommended to douse the onion with the white vinegar on your table to cut the sharpness of the onion and dip it into the black bean paste before eating.

The Ja Jang Myun (black bean noodles) is very rich and savoury, but really hits the spot if you've got a noodle craving. Their standard Ja Jang Myun has ground meat and onions, but they have seafood options as well.

Kkampongi is essentially the Korean version of Sweet and Sour Chicken. Depending on the location, this dish can have a slight spicy kick, but I've yet to find that yet... It's sweet and very crispy (different batter than the Chinese counterpart).

We had a dish (can't remember the name off the top of my head) which was fried chicken on a bed of cabbage and green chilies on top. The sauce lathered on top was mildly sweet, and tangy. The green chilies really gives it the kick it needs. Very delicious!

All in all, really great Korean joint for cheap eats. Leave it to Sunny Dragon to be your gateway into the world of Korean food, or rather a partial bit."}
{"text":"I come here when I do my laundry right around the corner, and the place is amazing! They have a good variety of chinese dishes and korean dishes to choose from. I really like the fried rice with the egg wrapped around and the korean fried chicken. Good amount, fair price! I like what they do with the beer too (order a beer and find out!!) Hits the spot every time..."}
{"text":"Cheap option for Korean Chinese restaurant. Their food can be mediocre but they are very reasonably priced for what you get. Lunch deals are also great I think most items are less than $10. Their set menu for bigger groups are also good and come with a variety of dishes, a good option if you need to treat a big group."}
{"text":"Though Sunny Dragon Restaurant is more catered to family or groups, but even eating here alone is a good experience!

I love how they have the half portion of JjamBbong (Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup) and  JaJangMyun (Black Bean Paste Noodle) for $9.99, so I can eat 2 different type of noodle dishes in 1 seating!

Great portion size and good prices! Noodles has great bite and JaJangMyum is on the sweet side but taste good with tons of meat sauce!

Lunch specials at $6.95 serves till 3:30 pm.

Sunny Dragon is my to go place for Korean Chinese Food. I think that's better than Chinese Korean Food?"}
{"text":"I ordered Jajangmyeon with Spicy seafood noodle and my boyfriend ordered Jajangmyeon. I really liked the noodle and the soup!"}
