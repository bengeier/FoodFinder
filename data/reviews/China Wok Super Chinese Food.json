{"text":"It makes me sad that I have to give this place a low rating. I have fond memories of coming here since I was 8 years old. Over the years, their quality decreased. I'm guessing their quality had to go down to be able to offer their $2 special. Although it's extremely cheap and filling, I can't stand to eat it anymore. The fried rice is mushy and you are lucky to even find a piece of carrot or pea in it."}
{"text":"Honestly some of the best Chinese food I have had and all for $5.19 per portion(HUGE portion!!). Their chicken wings, fried rice, chicken balls, sweet and sour chicken are very good!!! It's in a tacky/sketchy mall but that's OK, it's worth the trip out there to get such good food at such a low price."}
{"text":"Shrimp and rice was delicious and fresh crunchy fresh veggies chicken balls were full of white meat and crunchy outside great service and great chinese food for a low price"}
{"text":"I know a lot of people think Jane & Finch and automatically assume the worst, in my opinion those are people that are just plain ignorant.I have been coming to Yorkgate mall for years and yes although in some ways it could fit into what people consider \"ghetto\" it also has one of the BEST chinese take-out places ever!China Wok is where I go when I crave Chinese...because they deliver! They have all the favourites and always fresh and ready to go!You don't have to wait around for long and the food tastes amazing. And this place has the best breaded shrimp ever.....6 pieces for $3.00!!!I will always recommend this place! Nothing but the BEST!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down THE best place to have fried rice and chicken wings. No where else have I had the best combination of rice and chicken together. Their chicken balls are really good too! Friendly service. Great food.  

I grew up having Chinese food here and have always been my favourite no matter where I go.  Definitely recommend it.  

Try the $2 rice and chicken wings (you get two wings with fried rice)"}
{"text":"Friendly service and quick happy they been around 
Order catering chicken wings it was good they give you a lot of sauces too."}
{"text":"If there is a rating below one star, I would use that.
Nothing special about this place. We should have looked across and might get a better tasting food.. To each his own, but for sure, we are not coming back."}
