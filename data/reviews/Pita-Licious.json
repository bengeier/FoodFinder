{"text":"Came here one day with my friend because we wanted to try somewhere new. Read the yelp reviews here and sounded pretty good. 

My friend and I ordered the beef shawarma dinner plate and the chicken shawarma poutine to share. When we were waiting for our food to be made we noticed that they took the old leftover pieces of meat that was kept warm. Food is given to you in take out boxes.

Right after our first bite of both these dishes we immediately thought it was wayyyy too salty! The meat itself was just too salty and the sauces on top made it even worse. We ended up only eating about half our food. Really couldn't finish it because it was that salty."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this looking for a quick bite on my trip from Minneapolis.  Falafel sandwich was tasty.  Lots of toppings to choose from.  Tabouleh was ok.  Nothing special.  Affordable alternative to fast food.  Everything was fresh."}
{"text":"I tried the chicken shawarma today and it was very good. They put a good amount of the garlic sauce which I liked and they had very friendly service. Also had the 2 for 1 special gyro and it was also very good."}
{"text":"I checked this place out after seeing the great reviews on Yelp and I regret spending my hard earned cash at this place. I ordered the chicken shawarma which ended up being 8 dollars and the portion of it wouldn't even fill a elementary kid. Furthermore, with the portion being a question the chicken was not fresh and was already cut and being warned in a hot box making the chicken taste incredible horrible. The chicken tasted like mush in my mouth and the owners probably knew and drenched it with the house made garlic sauce which also tasted horrible. All I could taste was oil in my mouth. Over all I'm extremely disappointed and was expecting a decent shawarma place near my house but I guess that wouldn't be happening. Those who enjoyed this place problem never had good shawarma. I recommend trying out golden pita or pitalicious both places make good shawarmas that's worth your money unlike this place."}
{"text":"Great food, very busy and slow service but the food defiantly makes up for it. Food has lots of flavour and the environment is very nice. We felt very comfortable being here and I'm sure if it wasn't so busy the service would be great. We will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"I went in for a chicken shwarma in a pita and was not disappointed. The ingredients were fresh, and very tasty. The decor inside was very nice. I'd definitely go back when I'm the neighbourhood, certainly beats the chain fast food that dominate this part of Brampton."}
{"text":"Went here for the 1st time, and had the chicken and beef shawarma wrap, very good, except the chicken was obviously sitting in the pan, off the spit, for too long, hard inedible bits of chicken, other than that the beef was lean and tender.  Comparable with paramount, although more expensive and not as fresh.  A little pricey$$. If ur in the area, they are the only shawarma place within a 5km radius, so no competition.  Nice and clean with plenty of places to sit, score would be higher if it weren't so expensive and the chicken was fresher.  He could have cut some off the spit, but, he didn't.  So the score reflects that."}
{"text":"My 2nd time having shawarma and this place does not disappoint! Nice, clean comfortable environment. It was not busy when we got there so we had ample choices for dining in. The two men behind the counter were extremely friendly. I ordered the chicken shawarma and let the man make it to perfection, entrusting him completely to make the most authentic sandwich. 

My first bites were delicious! The tahini sauce, the hot sauce, the tzaziki sauce and hummus, melded on my palate in an orgasmic way, bringing all the other flavours of the chicken and veggies together beautifully! I didn't eat the whole pita as it was filling; and nearing the end, the sauces collected in the bottom of the wrapper making a  fantastic dripping soaked mess. I can't complain cause even though I don't like soggy bread, I wouldn't have it any other way! 

Will be back!"}
{"text":"All the favorite Middle Eastern foods are here.  Shawarma, gyro , falafel etc. Made fresh to order right in front of your eyes. Salads are fresh with rice and spicy potatoes. Take out or eat in the place is nice and clean."}
{"text":"Nice, clean space. Friendly staff.
 I have sampled three dishes. I found both the beef and chicken shawarma to be dry in a way that the toppings could not disguise. The kofta however, was excellent: juicy and flavourful.
 I am somewhat reluctant to pay $5 for hummus or baba ghanoush...dishes you can make for a dollar or two at home, if you have a blender.
 All in all, a welcome addition to a mall where carbs and stodge have ruled the roost."}
{"text":"Pita so Pitalicious it makes me go LOCO!

I came here for their 2 for 1 special deal (2 gyro or falafel for $8.79) I got one of each. Falafel was served on Arabic pita bread while gyro was served on a Greek pita bread.

Gyro and falafel were fresh and tasty. They got the usual toppings you find in most middle eastern restaurants which were fresh and crispy. Employee handed me 3 coupons for even more sweet deals.

Location is clean and well maintained. Great staff. Free WiFi curtsy of Starbucks!"}
{"text":"They make their own fresh falafel and it's not from frozen! It tasted really good and fresh. The topings were also plentyful."}
{"text":"I am so happy to have a shawarma place in Brampton and, even better, almost right next door to me. When Pita-Licious had their \"opening soon\" signs, I thought they meant pitas like Extreme Pita and would've been happy with that but this is so much better!

The place inside is surprisingly nice for a shawarma joint. There's even some couch seating. It's clear they spent thought and money on the layout of a pretty small unit.

The owners/staff are incredibly nice and accommodating. When I first went a few days after opening, I ordered some baklava with my meal and he automatically said that was on him. He then offered one of their arabic cookies to my friend who hadn't even ordered anything. These are people who understand customer service, the need to establish good will. and it is clear they really want to succeed.

The actual food is delicious of course, with some of the best tabouleh I've had yet. I plan to be a regular at this place and wish them the best in what is a competitive plaza!"}
{"text":"Do not go here, not worth it!  Bought a chicken schwarma wrap and the owner went skimpy on the chicken.  Totally not worth $8.79.  Save yourself time and money and go elsewhere.  Over priced and cheap on fillings!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday instead of subway, wanted to change it up. I know I'm not in Lebanon so my standard for falafel is not as high. I ordered just the sandwich, the falafel was rolled and fried fresh to order. The toppings were fresh as well, the tahini needed more garlic, and so did the hummus in my opinion. I wish there was also more falafel in a sandwich. Overall, the sandwich was good and hit the spot, as well the service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"My new favourite place to eat!! It's so close to my house. My new favourite dish is the kafta plate, it's very succulent and I highly recommend that along with their other selection of food. The customer service is excellent there, very polite and well mannered. I just love this place!!"}
{"text":"Just happened to find this place after a bike ride. What a find went in for lunch. Beautiful restaurant and the food is fresh and so good. Had the best shawarma I've ever tasted. Plus the staff is super friendly. We'll be back soon"}
{"text":"This was a well appointed restaurant. Clean and very friendly staff. Be careful of the hot sauce. It was hot for me but I am a baby. Potatoes were good. I liked the chicken better than the beef. There was no coca cola? Just diet and zero. Music was loud. Overall good but not fantastic."}
{"text":"I don't think everything is completely fresh.. The potatoes and rice definitely tasted like left overs and I don't even eat left overs at home.. If everything was completely fresh then, I would like this place, they aren't bad. The beef has more flavor then the chicken, the rice and potatoes did taste good, even though I felt it was left overs. Oh, and they need to re grill if they are going to serve, luke warm food. I don't know if I would come here again.. Not bad?"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place based on the previous reviews, and I am glad I did.  I had the chicken shawarma sandwich with the garlic potatoes and it was very very yummy.  The garlic potatoes were my favourite.  With the extra sauce on the potatoes added to the yummy fresh taste.  The guys behind the counter were very nice and friendly.  I will definitely be back.  There are combos for each day.  Great prices too."}
