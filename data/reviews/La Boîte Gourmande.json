{"text":"Incroyable Brunch à la boîte Gourmande, trop bon tout ce qu'on a pris et pas chère! L'ambiance était aussi sympa et le service parfait! Ça fait plaisir!"}
{"text":"I went for a third time during the long weekend. Service was not friendly at all. Food was average but nothing special. I told the manager that he had a broken chair and table and he gave me the ultimate look of indifference. When I left 45 minutes later, the broken table and chair had not been removed from the dining area. 
I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to brunch on Saturday morning, maybe on the Plateau and close to a subway station ? Look no further, bacon, eggs, fruit, bagel and coffee. Although the coffee was a bit on the small side, it was really good ! Will come back again."}
{"text":"Endroit spacieux et sympa pour un brunch avec des amis qui ont aussi de très jeunes enfants. J'ai bien aimé le jus et l'entrée ainsi que les crêpes au sarrasin farcies de jambon, de fromage et d'épinards. Mais je regrette le montant de la facture. Trop salée à mon goût. Surtout pour un brunch sans rôties et sans réchauds de café. Je suis resté sur ma faim."}
{"text":"Think of this place more as a locals neighbourhood resto-café. Nothing fancy, almost reminiscent of a cafeteria, but with plateau flare. With this in mind, I'd give it 3.5 stars. 

I mean if you're thinking of coming out here just for this place, than I probably wouldn't recommend it. But if you're in the hood and looking for a chill place to work, have a meeting, enjoy a coffee and dessert, than yes this is it! 

In the summer, they have a quaint terrace. Plus it's literally two steps from Metro Laurier. 

My favourite part of Boite Gourmande is that they make all their cakes, cookies, cupcakes, brownies in house. And they stock a wide range of daily baked goods, which never disappoint. 

So whenever you're feeling peckish with a sweet craving, this is always a good option."}
{"text":"Bought two ham and cheese wraps here and both were moldy (very obvious and distinct mold taste was noticed by my friend and I). Spoke to the owner who was not receptive at all. He eventually became extremely rude and accused me of lying. He said it was impossible that the sandwiches were moldy because he saw no green and according to him mold is green. Reported this cafe to City of Montreal food inspection. You couldn't pay me to eat here."}
{"text":"One more update to my review. This place went from 5 to 4 to 3 stars over the years. Now it's an ok, conveniently located place, where I still go for the large space, family friendly atmosphere, and pretty good options for coffee and snack. Regular lunch is alright. The brunch is definitely not what it used to be and it's not even on my list when I am trying to find a brunch option around here. Things change and evolve in a way or another, that's the way life goes..."}
{"text":"Je me comprend pas bien pourquoi c'est souvent plein.. La situation peut-être?

L'assiette brunch est franchement pauvre comparée à la concurrence et le prix est par contre bien supérieur. À part la porte de chambre forte qui décore les lieux de façon inhabituelle -- le restaurant est installé dans les anciens locaux d'une banque -- je ne vois rien qui justifie des prix aussi élevés.

Café et service médiocres. Sourires rarissimes."}
{"text":"Not only are the breakfasts way overpriced, but the music and service leave a lot to be desired.  Pretty much the only breakfast place I've been to where they don't refill your coffee."}
{"text":"This review is for just the delicious gluten-free almond chocolate cake that I had. It was moist and sweet, and I'm glad that I don't live in Montreal because I would have this every day and certainly put on a few pounds. I suggest grabbing a delicious morning snack here and then going across the street for perfect coffee."}
{"text":"I love that place. Great food, awesome services, good ambiance... this is where I go every morning for my breakfast! Love there Petit Pressé!"}
{"text":"Great for lunch too!  Food was truly Excellent. Staff were friendly. It doesn't look like much from outside but inside is large, bright, chilled atmosphere with local art on the walls. Menu is not extensive and changes daily but food is fresh, healthy and VERY tasty. Great vegetarian options too. Order at buffet cafeteria style and hot dishes are delivered to your table when ready which was pretty quick considering the place was 90% full during lunch hour. Recommended."}
{"text":"Voici un resto surprenant. Surprenant parce que de l'extérieur franchement, ça a vraiment l'air de rien... Et même à l'intérieur d'ailleurs! Bon ok y'a une ambiance ancien atelier, avec de hauts plafonds et des matériaux type métal un peu partout mais ce qu'on retient surtout du premier regard qu'on pose ici, c'est l'ambiance de cafétéria. Alors forcément, on pense qu'on va avoir un bouffe de type cafétéria, le genre bourratif, sans trop de gout mais pas trop cher.  Et effectivement, c'est bien vu sur les prix qui sont vraiment bons. Sauf que voilà, la bouffe aussi est bonne! Et je dirai même étonnamment fine! Et aussi très bien présentée. Moi j'avais pris une sorte de salade au poulet, et bien jamais une salade ne m'avait paru aussi souriante auparavant!
Il y a aussi des choix de soupes, sandwiches, dessert, plats du jour et aussi des breuvages chauds ou froids et du pain qui est excellent. (Et c'est une Française qui vous le dit!) 
Enfin, dernier point positif, le service était très bon et les gens souriants."}
{"text":"Yeah, I decided to come back and I won't make that mistake again. That is how rude the service is. Actually rude enough to keep me from a good egg sandwich, which is a lot...

It's bad enough that you have to \"order at the counter\" (which is a pretty vague instruction after all...) and that, of course, no one will actually bother to look up and take your order so you have to kind of awkwardly stand there clearing your throat and hoping that someone notices you look hungry. But then, when you get it wrong, and accidentally order at the cash instead (not wanting to bother the folks who are way too busy cooking), they rudely inform you that you messed up, and that if you're hungry, because you've been sitting around waiting for a sandwich that will never arrive, you kind of deserve it.

No more - this place is ridiculous."}
{"text":"It keeps me coming back. 

It's got a cafeteria feel to it. But the food is way better than what your would expect from a cafeteria. I've only come for lunch but I've never been disappointed. It's very laid back. I really like the feel of the high ceilings and touch of the good old days. Small menu, but is appears to change daily. It's also a cafe where you can just hang out with a coffee, read a paper or surf the web."}
{"text":"Une cafeteria nouveau genre. Parfait pour bruncher!"}
{"text":"I came for breakfast/brunch with a group. I knew this place as a fixture along Laurier, with steady traffic from the metro station and from the yoga studio upstairs. 

We had heard that there had recently been a change in ownership here, and they appear to be working out some kinks. My sunny side-up eggs were overcooked: while the yolks oozed a little, they didn't run. Burned-black toast seemed to be an issue. One of my friends' breakfasts came with all four pieces of toast burned completely black on one side. This seems like pretty basic stuff for breakfast service. (Puzzlingly, burning was a problem for everyone who ordered multigrain toast but the baguette and bagel options came out just fine.) 

The coffee is par for the course, or better, at a good diner or breakfast place. I drained my cup pretty fast, as I am wont to do at brunch, and went back for more; the staff somewhat sheepishly informed me that there were no free refills, and that I would have to pay. At least it was only $1.95 and there were only three people in line in front of me. I returned to my table to share the \"no free refills\" news with my friends, and just a few minutes later, a woman did the same the next table over in the same disappointed tone. 

The atmosphere remains the same as I had seen it from the sidewalk for years before visiting: convivial and welcoming, even if not spilling out onto patio tables as it does in the summer months. I found the prices very reasonable and the food (above issues aside) to be satisfying and well-portioned, if not enormous. I will definitely return but I may drink a coffee on the way first, and I will definitely hope for more edible toast."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this café. I am sure they will start knowing me by name soon enough - I visit several times per week. 

First, the decor is so welcoming and charming. A whole wall constructed from old doors, big airy spaces and a cute room in the back fashioned from what must have been an old bank vault. The walls in this room are made of chalkboards perfect for philosophizing 

Brunch, lunch, coffee tea and desserts are delicious. The soup changes daily and is ALWAYS good. I love the staff, they all seem to really enjoy being at work and they contribute to the neighborhood feel that I get from this place. 

It`s a perfect place to meet a bunch of friends, a colleague for coffee or to grab a spot by the window to people watch on a rainy day. Best spot in the area hands down"}
{"text":"The sandwich I picked up was dope! Crispy bacon, delicate eggs, flaky croissant... It was perfect.
 On to the ordering process... That left a lot to be desired... I'm not the first person to complain about the lack of clear directions and whatever assumptions you make are almost certainly guaranteed to be wrong, so keep that in mind. 

Food gets a high 5. The service is alright. The atmosphere is airy, open, clean. Just know what you want before you get in line, and then whilst tucking your tail between your legs, ask them if you get it at the counter, or if they will be bringing it out to your table.

Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"J'y étais vers 9h30 un lundi matin avec le journal. 
L'endroit est très aéré, avec de grandes tables permettant ainsi de ne pas se sentir tassé comme dans certains autres resto/cafés. 
Ayant commandé un latte, l'employée me demanda avec combien d'unité d'expresso je le désirais, ce que j'ai vraiment apprécié. Son service fut \"correcte\" mais son latte très bon!
Je vais très possiblement y retourner pendant la session scolaire pour y étudier."}
{"text":"Un beau petit café/cafétéria juste en dessous de mon studio de yoga. C'est situé parfaitement pour que j'en profite pour prendre un thé quand j'arrive vraiment trop tôt pour mon cours de yoga. J'y ai aussi mangé quelques fois et c'est toujours pas mal bon. L'avantage des repas du jour est que la plupart du temps, on vous donne l'option d'une portion pleine ou bien d'une demi-portion! Parfait pour les petites faims qui n'aiment pas gaspiller! Le wifi gratuit est disponible grâce à Île Sans Fil! Avec de petites et très grandes tables disponibles, c'est parfait pour travailler ou étudier, autant seul qu'avec un petit groupe. C'est aussi juste à côté du métro Laurier, alors si vous avez à vous y rendre pour un rendez-vous, vous n'aurez pas à vous inquiéter pour trouver ce beau petit café, ou bien si une urgence à l'autre bout de la ville vous attends, vous serez vite en chemin!"}
{"text":"I came here to meet friends for brunch and was pleased with the price, the fact that you get fruit salad and a little smoothie to accompany your brunch and there is always seating, inside and outside. Lots of choices for vegetarians and the coffee was pretty tasty as well. That said, carrying a mug of coffee, your plate loaded with food stuff and your utensils? Screw it, I'd rather pay the money and be served rather than almost burn myself trying to get to my table (there is a reason why I was NEVER a waitress, people!)

My complaint about this place though is that is is SO confusing! I was in line with everyone else and when I got to the cash, he asked what I wanted, wrote it down and asked where I was going to be sitting. I waited and waited and no food came. Finally I trotted up to the counter and the cash dude shrugged at me even though I showed him my bill. The cook noticed what was going on and motioned for me to come over. I told him that everyone else in my group had food except for me and he shook his head and said \"sorry, but you should have told me what you wanted, not the cashier\"...ummm ok. There should be a sign or something cause how in the f&*k would anyone know to interrupt the line cooks and say \"I want some French toast, yo\"."}
{"text":"Ca bouge dans le café mais tres agreable, grande fenestration , en face du metro laurier. Special 2 pour 1 pour les repas pour emporter dand le frigo les vendredis apres 4pm ."}
{"text":"Tout près du métro Laurier juste en bas du Bikram c'était une ancienne Caisse Desjardins. Des gens sympa sont à la cuisine et les prix sont très abordables.  J'y ai mangé une bonne soupe. L'endroot est aéré avec un plafond très haut et il n'y a pas trop de bruits. Musique calme d'ambiance."}
{"text":"L'endroit est très joli, longs bancs d'église en guise de banquette, une porte de voûte, vestige d'une ancienne banque, agrémente l'entrée de la 2e salle à manger. Prix raisonnables, un grand café pour moins de 3$, petit déjeuner du jour pour 4,95. Ici, on ne se ruine pas! En contrepartie, le café est ordinaire, la nourriture est faite avec des ingrédients frais et de bonne qualité, mais manque un peu de saveur (à mon goût). Mais pour le prix, on sourit car on n'a pas dépensé tout nos sous et que somme toute, la satisfaction est au rendez-vous, même si on est pas tombée à la renverse de plaisirs gustatifs!"}
