{"text":"Very good Indian food. Arguably slightly on the expensive side, but nice atmosphere, consistently good service, and delicious, albeit mainstream, Indian food."}
{"text":"Very simply, they have a great $10 takeout buffet.  The food and service are top notch and they are passionate about their cooking.  Lots of options both veggie and meaty.  With very little effort you can stuff a take out container to the gills and be in a delightful food coma in no time.  Yes the menu is fairly typical with all you'd expect from your average Indian restaurant, but it's always fresh, always tasty and well prepared."}
{"text":"**TAKEOUT REVIEW*  Having seen two solid reviews of this place, I was shocked at my own experience.  Stopped in at 9 on a Monday evening to find the dining room lighs out (until I pulled the door open, that is) and one person in the place - the guy working there (he seemed like an owner, but I'm not sure).  The Good:  Owner-guy was very friendly.  The Bad:  The butter chicken (that owner-guy claimed they were famous for) was more like cinnamon chicken, and was light on chicken.  The rice was dry, obviously cooked some time ago.  The Ugly:  For $21.70, it's appalling that owner-guy would even consider serving me a microwaved dinner.  But that's exactly what he did - about eight minutes on medium, with occasional stirring.  I'm still in shock."}
{"text":"Closed!  Shocking!"}
{"text":"The only thing worst than the food here are the prices.   The service here is great and so is the ambience. Unfortunately everything else you can get better from the frozen foods isle at Loblaws.  The lunch wasn't terrible...but the delivered dinner was really hard to swallow. I don't normally enjoy writing mean reviews but carrot aachar and white rice mixed together should NOT be called vegetable biryani!"}
