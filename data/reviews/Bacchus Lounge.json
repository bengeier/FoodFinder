{"text":"One word - sliders.  The sliders here are seasoned perfectly, have a slightly crunchy bun and are just the right size to have 2 and a salad and be full.  The draft beer selection is great and the service is fast and friendly.  

Very fun place to hang with friends and get a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I know Russo's has usually good food, so I naturally thought this would be an extension of that, but it is not."}
{"text":"Excellent Po Boys!  Chef made us oyster ones on request. Sat outside and had a great lunch."}
{"text":"Always a favorite when we are in the area. Stopped in for a couple Long Islands, Boneless wings with the Tiger Sauce and a Pizza!"}
{"text":"Monday night is $5.00 burger night at Bacchus Lounge, located in the building that also holds Russo's. Reviews for Bacchus have been good, but their prices were noted to be rather high (burgers are listed as $9.00-$11.00). So, myself and 17 burger-loving friends crashed this place on a recent Monday evening to take advantage of their $5.00 offer. Not surprisingly we overwhelmed them. I tried to pass on word to the kitchen that we did not have to be served all at once- bring out the burgers as they were done. Unfortunately, the kitchen didn't get that message.

When we were finally served 45 minutes after ordering we were all pleasantly surprised. The burgers were great. Burgers come with a choice of one of eight cheeses and choice of three of 21 different toppings. I went with Bleu Cheese, topped with caramelized sweet onions, avocado and bacon. While the bacon could have been more crisp, the combination of the cheese, onions and avocado was fantastic! I will be trying this one again. And nearly everyone in the party had a similar experience. Fries ($4.00) were served hot right out of the fryer, the only way to eat fries, and were more than adequate for this meal.

I am rating Bacchus at 4 1/2 stars (I know you can't give a half star, so I am verbally). I would encourage anyone to try Bacchus on $5.00 Burger Mondays."}
{"text":"I love Bacchus Lounge ... it's a great place to sit back and have a cocktail. It's been awhile since I had done more than have just a drink there, so last night I decided to get some food. We started off with the chips and guac, which was amazing, so I highly recommend. Then I got a house salad and some crab cakes. If I am going to a restaurant, I usually try to steer away from just eating a salad, since I can make that for myself at home. But Bacchus has white french dressing, which I am OBSESSED with, and it is very hard to find it at any other restaurant, or even in the stores. So it was a must for me. The crab cakes were also delicious. They had a little bit of a kick to them, but I can't really handle anything spicy, so I'm sure any normal person would be OK with them."}
{"text":"I have to be quite honest when I say that this restaurant really confuses me. It is part of Russo's but is the lounge part of the restaurant. Bacchus sits in the very back of Russo's and has it's own menu but the two places are attached. I am very confused on why they have two separate names. 

After all my fuss and confusion I have to say I really like the menu and food here. They do have happy hour (not listed on their website) that has a few food and beer/cocktail offerings. We started with the Red Bean Nachos, which were to die for! 3 of us scraped that plate completely clean! For dinner I ordered the Spicy Brasato Sandwich which was absolute perfection! The braised beef on this sandwich is incredibly delicious. The flavors were so good that I didn't want to stop eating, although I did, so I could have the sandwich again the next day! Even the desserts were on point!

This place is definitely worth checking out for a casual meal packed with amazing flavors!"}
{"text":"Go Here Go Now! Everything is always fantastic and fresh. Pizza is so yummy but if you truly love good fried chicken then Bacchus is for you. So crisp and deliscious and you have to put the pepper relish all over each bite. my mouth is wateriing as I type. They also have these smothered house fries that we seem to never have enough of. Great wine list good beer list great people. this place is the back part of Russos just so you odont miss it."}
{"text":"Food is good, Pricey.  
Atmosphere is good, Music related.  
Specials are horrible or non existent.  
They have \"Taco Night\" which a few friends and I went to. 
For \"Taco Night\" there are actually no specials except for $5 Margaritas and they way they offer it is shady, Here is what happened.

ME: Taco Night perfect what are your specials?
SERVER: $5 Margaritas
ME: You don't have specials on tacos for \"Taco Night\"?
SERVER: No just $5 Margaritas.
ME: OK Ill have a mango Margarita.

Later - 
Check comes, I was charged full price for the Margarita. ($9+)
ME: I ordered a Margarita and was charged full price?
SERVER: Oh Yeah, If you want the $5 Margarita you have to order THE $5 MARGARITA...

I guess my only advise would be to watch what you order and how you order it because they run the menu like a legal contract.  (A LOT of small print)

Very Shady in my opinion."}
{"text":"Hidden gem tucked away behind amazing creole restaurant- enter in back. Nightly specials, happy hour and flat screens. Yet it doesn't feel pretentious or seedy, it's found a comfy place in the middle. Fabulous angus burger with malt powder on the fries is my goto meal. Great wine and beer list but the nightly specials are amazing! $1.50 oyster shucks on Tuesday with a squeeze of lemon, cocktail sauce and a dash of LA hot sauce were briny heaven in my mouth!!! Served ice cold - I ordered another round of them immediately!!! Staff is great and prices are great. It was 1/2 off app night as well so I'll be returning regularly."}
{"text":"This is a fun bar space on the back of Russo's.  I went with the Wednesday night special of a $10 large pizza with two toppings.  I ordered it with the hot banana peppers and onions and the pizza was tasty and had the right amount of heat I was looking for.  But the winning dish of the night was the Bacchus nachos.  The nachos had beans, chihuahua cheese, an awesome sauce, and tasty sprinkled on seasoning.  I could have asked for more description on the sauce and seasoning but I was too busy stuffing my face."}
{"text":"I don't even write reviews but felt compelled to do so.

Probably the most overpriced place I've ever eaten. And yes I've eaten in New York City. Ordered the jambalaya from the entree part of the menu. $10 for one cup. Naturally I was still hungry expecting an entree so I ordered the Grilled chicken po-boy. $12 for a bread and mayonnaise po-boy w 2 oz of chicken. I've never left a place feeling like I truly got pick-pocketed. Cant say that anymore."}
{"text":"Go here about once a month. Great pizzas, the fried chicken is the best around, and the various new orleans influenced specials are ahhhh-mazing. It's a little more laid-back than the sister restaurant Russo's (not that Russo's is overly fancy)."}
{"text":"Bacchus Lounge is the perfect place to go for a casual but amazing meal. I love to go here after a long day at work when I don't feel like cooking but crave something really tasty. Their pizzas are fantastic and so are the wings...and the burgers...and the Cajun food. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Although the menu is quite eclectic, Bacchus specializes in New Orleans-style flavors. 

The interior is casual - with a bar, wooden tables and a few TVs, and it is attached to the more upscale Russo's restaurant. 

On our last visit, I got the Sazerac, a classic New Orleans drink, and the gumbo ya ya complete with Crystals hot sauce, which you don't typically see in Ohio restaurants. 

My husband got the burger, and he said it had a really unique and flavorful seasoning. He added a fried green tomato and an egg for an extra southern touch."}
{"text":"I realize this is late but stopped here last summer.  We waited 15 min for a table but the hostess/waitstaff were so disorganized that a party of two was seated ahead of us, at a 4 person table, even though we were there first, and we were a party of 4.  Since we were not in a hurry, we didn't say aNything, just waited until next table was available.  When it was, we were seated by the rushed hostess.

Now comes the frustrating part; there were only 2 or 3 waitresses working and not one of them came over to take a drink order.  We were even trying to get their attention but they were obviously ignoring us.  They all looked very overworked and frazzled, and I think they just didnt care.  Anyhow, we were at the table for 15 min without any service so we got up and left.  Haven't been back but hope they got their staffing problems corrected"}
{"text":"We love Russo's and were excited to find the more casual bacchus behind the restaurant.  Taco Thursday is fantastic- (we always get grilled chicken or steak) and the guac is better than some Mexican restaurants around! Definitely get the peanut butter pie you won't be disappointed ."}
{"text":"We go this restaurant a couple times a year.  The waitress tonight was very rude and wasn't paying attention to customers and their orders. She was too busy socializing at the bar with her coworkers.  The food was so so.   I used to really like this place.  Won't be back"}
{"text":"Wife and I found this place by accident. Glad we did!! Bacchus is an excellent local bar that provides live entertainment, spirits and serves a WIDE variety of dishes, from fried chicken to Cajun/Mexican to grilled burgers, fries, pasta and even pizza (which is fantastic, btw). The food can be hit-or-miss (the veggie patty can be awesome or awful, depending on the night), but when it hits, it hits. The service is always pretty good and the great atmosphere and excellent food have my wife and I coming back week-after-week."}
{"text":"Business and family favorite. My wife didn't like Cajun food until we went to \"The Big Easy\" and fell in love with the whole thing. Now she will only go the Russo's/Bacchus to relive the experience. The meals are a bit inconsistent but always good. If you are stuck in Ohio craving the casual NO experience close your eyes and drift through your time/space warp the the Bayou."}
{"text":"Had a quiet business lunch here last week - at night, the front (Russo's) is open, and my lunch partners said that the food is similar but with much higher prices, so they prefer to come here at lunch.  I can see why!

We arrived right at opening, and we were greeted and sat very quickly.  Service was a bit slow throughout the lunch, but we weren't in a huge hurry, so not a huge deal (we were still done in about an hour, so not too bad for a sit down lunch).  Everyone else started with soup, but I held out for the burrito special, knowing that it would be more than I could finish.  Well seasoned, juicy beef and fresh rice, I was a happy girl.  About $10 for my burrito - definitely not a bargain, but for a served lunch, it's about right."}
{"text":"Good happy hour drinks specials. Portions are small for price. Slow service. Order a angus burger medium came dry and well done. A bowl of soup was more like a cup of soup. Fried chicken was awesome though- tender and crispy."}
{"text":"SHHH! I don't want to tell this. Yet, my tongue is so happy it's doing it's own thing.  It's dancing and flapping and says I must tell you that this place is one of the best little secrets in Northeastern Ohio.  I have always been delighted here. Have you ever gone to TJ Maxx and found some overly priced, namebrand item for a third of the price?  Yippee!  Right?

I don't think it's a big sister, Russo's in the front, comes at a big price. My point is for the quality, the enjoyment and the atmosphere this place is one hell of a value.  The menu is unique for this area and the cocktail list is impressive. The atmosphere is laid-back and casual, but the food is top notch. That Spicy Brasato, oooooh that Spicy Brasato!  Ok, enough now back to writing. This is the type of place that triple D should visit. Then it wouldn't be a secret anymore. SHHHH!"}
