{"text":"Tom's is at a brilliant location: Queen and Ossington - so it gets its fair share of CAMH (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health) clients, so it's not without some fun.  The menu is cheap (but jumped recently: the $2.75 hamburger went up to $2.95), and the service is fast.  There are a few women who work there - the younger ones are spot-on, but Tom's wife is only pleasant if it's not too busy.  Grab a table, order breakfast - the bacon is lovely; the portions are big."}
{"text":"excellent service, down home country cooking - all fresh made to order.  homemade chicken rice soup was lovely, irish breakfast was perfectly done -- w/ proper pan fried home-fries (not glorified french fried squares :) ), fish and chips were fresh and good - fresh cut fries, and i had turkey open face platter - the fact that it had beef gravy on it instead of turkey is the only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars.  homemade mashed taters too.  homemade turkey.  all very good - we will return."}
{"text":"Tom's or Ted's as I call it -- because Ted is the owner, is one of my favorite Queen west places to eat.  Don't judge a book by its cover as some would say.  Ted makes awesome roast beef sandwhiches, and while the food is definately reminiscent of a greasy diner, its not bad at all.  Breakfast is great, lunch and dinner.  The steak sandwhich is my fav.  Fries are good too.  Milkshakes may be made with syrup and ice cream, but they are yummy.  I am a fan of Tom's Restaurant."}
{"text":"I never expected to find Tom's Restaurant on Yelp! But since it's here, I'll add my praise for it. This is greasy spoon diner dining at its best. The place is absolutely nothing special in the decor department, and service, while always prompt, can be friendly or not so, depending on the server. Ted's wife is the unfriendliest. Ted himself (not Tom - Ted obviously bought the place from Tom sometime in the past) seems rather shy, but if you come in often enough and give him a \"Hi\" you can start getting a smile and a nod.  There's a small bunch of regulars that come in after 5 for beers, just ordinary working-class folks. There's also a regular trickle of take-out business for coffee from CAMHers.  I eat there often for lunch and dinner and occasionally breakfast, as it's just around the corner from me. Maybe too often sometimes if I'm snowed under with work and can't be bothered to think about cooking.  Try the homeburger. It costs a little more, but Ted makes the patty himself. Also, watch for the spaghetti and meatballs special on the chalkboard in the window - it's not a regular item; the menu item is spaghetti with meat sauce, which is quite a filling meal in itself, but the meatball special is even better.  However, my favourite is the chicken souvlaki dinner. Souvlaki very nicely grilled, downscale version of a Greek salad, rice, potatoes and a roll; it's delicious.  A big plus for me is that Ted's is moderately quiet, especially at lunch when the back is open. For a person who's hard of hearing it's a blessing not having to cope with loud music. I gave up on the Lakeview Lunch after they put speakers in the only slightly quiet spot in the place."}
{"text":"Sad to see that this place has closed down. A great place for traditional breakfast and very cheap too. Friendly staff, they were willing to customize my order a bit by substituting the bread with eye bread."}
{"text":"Really good diner food at a great price.  I went there for lunch and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Another wonderful place to have an inexpensive standard breakfast to start your day."}
{"text":"I really really really want to love this place.  I mean I love cheap greasy spoon dives as much as the next person and possibly more, especially if you've heard about some of my epic food journeys.  The thing is, I don't.  It's not the lack of cleanliness of the restaurant.  I mean that's a star in my opinion for a greasy diner! :)  It's not even that the menu is tiny and limited, that's also is a staple of diner dive.  I had this funky taste from the breakfast I ordered from here.  Bacon, eggs, potatoes, toast and grease.  The potatoes were ok not my favourite type of diner potatoes but the eggs and bacon had this weird taste to it that I really did not like.    Will I try it again and possibly risk my health?  Hell yeahs!  However, I'm going to have to let some time pass before going back."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch the other day and had the classic burger combo. The combo comes with hand-cut fries and a salad. The salad was an iceberg salad of the type your mother probably made for you back in the 80's and 90's. I honestly haven't had an iceberg lettuce salad since I was a kid and I don't miss them. Needless to say I didn't really touch this one aside from the cucumber slices.  The burger was homemade and had an impressive char. The patty, unfortunately, was very well done so it was a bit dry. The fries were thick and handcut, but not very crispy. They had a really golden brown colour, but just not very crisp. Not sure whether the oil was too old or they're cooking at too high of a temp, but the fries would be better if they were just a tad crisper.   This is an old school, small town family restaurant that probably won't wow you, but will likely satisfy you all the same."}
{"text":"wow.  if you absolutely, must have breakfast and no where else is open (our situation) then enter blindly and deal with it.  A total greasy spoon, which is usually appealing to me.  the patronage was frightening (and that's coming from a recovering alcoholic).  My over easy eggs were served atop my pancakes.  Is that a candian thing? Doesn't matter since its greek immigrants operating the place.  They were nice, which helped."}
{"text":"Homey small town diner. Exactly what you'd expect in terms of choice and quality. Homemade soups and pies. Try the French onion soup!"}
{"text":"Some of the food is cheaply priced, but that's because it's cheap. The cheese sandwiches are made from processed cheese, and the meat in the Western sandwich was so gross it made me feel nauseous, and I couldn't finish it. The coffee is decent and cheap. My main qualm with the restaurant is that the last time I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, the owner (is his name Tom?) took my money, rinsed his hands for a max of 2 seconds without soap, and then flipped my sandwich with the help of one hand. Ugh... no. The other reviews describe the typical clientele, which represents atmosphere of the place."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look fancy or anything but BOY do they make a mean roast beef!!! Definitely recommend this place, also operated by avery cute and friendly old couple."}
{"text":"I eat here ALL the time. I work right nearby, so it's a perfect lunch spot. They have all the greasy diner requisites (grilled cheese, homeburger, french fries, onion rings), but also a great Greek Salad with Chicken, and a Chicken wrap with peppers and mushrooms that's really good.  Once you get past the smokers and people asking for money out front, you'll find some friendly staff and great, cheap food!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location and dodgy storefront fool you, this place is a true, throwback diner that carries no pretension and offers simple, but honestly prepared food. $4.25 breakfast special with bottomless coffee  is available before 11am, and only a buck more the rest of the day. There is also a blackboard lunch/dinner special that changes daily: steak, pork chops, souvlaki, roast beef, spaghetti, etc. Ted, the owner, is a decent, charming guy."}
{"text":"Tom's was my go-to greasy diner place when I lived in Liberty Village. I still crave its cheap yet yummy breakfasts surrounded by oodles of entertainment (read: crazies from CAMH).  It's not the fanciest of places by far, nor probably the cleanest. But the truth is that the food is made fresh to order, the service is pretty quick and the price can't be beat.   Now that I live on the other side of the city I really miss this place when I'm paying $11 for 2 eggs and a side of bacon - at Tom's I could eat like a queen, roll out of that place, suffer concurrent heart attacks and be begging for more cause I still have an extra $6 to spend."}
{"text":"This place is around the corner from me, and I have always been hesitant to try it. Stupid me! Just because it's across the street from the CAMH, and there are sometimes suspicious people outside, I avoided trying an excellent diner. Well, no more.  Breakfast yesterday. There were a few tables occupied, and soccer on the TV. All sorts of egg combos are available, including the Canadian, 3 eggs any style, choice of meat, white or brown toast and home fries for $6. BrianS chose that, and I ordered the spinach and feta omelet. The verdict? Very good. #1 - they give you heaping portions for cheap. #2 - yummy food. The omelet was creamy and full of feta and spinach, the potatoes had some creative spicing and #3 - good friendly service.  Really, everything a diner should be.   I will be back. A grilled cheese for less than $3! (before tax) Oh yea, I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place I think is the best breakfast deal in town. After 11a its the second best breakfast deal in town.  For 4.95, you get 3 eggs, bacon, sausage or ham, potatoes, toast and coffee! after 11a, its $1 more.  This is your no fuss, home cooking, quick and easy breakfast. I'd come back here everyday. What's funny are the alternatives the neighbors offer for a bit more expensive."}
{"text":"Tom's isn't the cleanest or fanciest place by any stretch of the imagination. It's more like an old rundown diner ... but it's a cheap quick place to get a delicious breakfast ($5 including tax!).  It's across the street from CAMH so some of the people hanging around are kind of sketchy ... but just politely decline whatever they want (asking money, selling you a radio, bumming a cigarette, etc.) and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Shady people in and in front of the place shouldn't deter you from eating here. It is a greasy spoon diner at its finest.  Super cheap, huge ass, deliciously filling breakfast. I don't promise cleanliness, or even servers with clean fingernails. But it gets the job done."}
