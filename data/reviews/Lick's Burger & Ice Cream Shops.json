{"text":"Easily the best fast food in Oakville, if not the whole GTA. Their nature burgers are simply TO DIE FOR. There are plenty of awesome menu items and it they're almost all as health conscious as you'll find at a fast food place. They also have ice cream.  It's a bit pricey and the wait is longer than at Mickey D's but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"It ain't what it used to be.  Growing up in Bronte, Lick's has always been a big part of my life, and my regular rotation of restaurants.  It is still pretty good, but not as good as it used to be.  The burgers are still really tasty and nice and juicy, but the prices have gone up so much that 2 burgers with cheese to go cost me $15 yesterday!  The portions have gotten smaller, toppings on the burgers as well, and the $1 they charge for a small pinch of cheddar cheese isn't worth it.  At this point I only go back when I am in town visiting my family, but I am always satisfied after my meal.  If your options are McDonald's or Lick's, I'd choose Lick's hands down any time."}
{"text":"Best burger you can find in a fast food joint.  Best veggie burger you can find anywhere (although not exactly a healthy alternative to the beef patty).  Great shakes (ask for a strawberry milkshake blended with a banana and chocolate milk-- a delicious secret introduced by friends of mine when they worked at Lick's in highschool!)  It is what it is. And it always is. And it is delicious. That's Lick's."}
