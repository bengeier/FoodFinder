{"text":"Mediterra Cafe is coming in hot!!  I've been impatiently stalking their social media account ever since I first heard that it was coming to Sewickley several months ago.  For as many perfectly lovely places as we have here in the Village, no one location has married together excellent boulangerie/patisserie offerings, high quality meats and cheeses, simple plates, and specialty/high-end grocery the way that Mediterra is clearly aiming to.  My boyfriend and I had dinner on their first open day to the public.  We shared the grilled eggplant and pastrami sandwiches, and while both were excellent, we agreed that the pastrami in particular just got better and better with every bite. 

It was so memorable, in fact, that we returned for breakfast just this morning and split a slice of quiche, plus a scone, a butter croissant, an almond croissant, and a regular drip coffee for me and a cold brew for him.  The quiche was done proper: very soft, silky, and custardy. The dressed greens on the side had the perfect amount of acidity and bitterness to compliment it.  My croissants were good, though truth be told, a certain other French bakery located in Lawrenceville & Downtown is still my #1 for being closest to what I've had in Paris and is priced more favorably. However, vennoiseries are much more in their wheelhouse, whereas Mediterra's is clearly in the artisan bread category. Loaves of which are in my To Try Next list. On the whole, however, I found the prices to be quite on par with city prices for similar offerings, if not a little lower. Oh, and before I just breeze over that coffee, can I just say that if you like iced coffee, you have to try their cold brew.  When you dine in, it straight up comes ion a tray in a decanter and highball glass, complete with a giant round cube of ice. Classy as all get out, and not to mention the dang coffee is SO smooth. My drip coffee was lovely as well, although it edged just on the bitter side.

The decor has a bit of a French brassierie feel to it, although most of the grocery items are Italian. I ain't mad about it.  There are so many little details and touches that make this place feel warm and accessible, yet high end. My boyfriend, a marking and visual design guy, was particularly geeked out when he noticed that the window lettering was hand-painted. 

And last, but certainly not least, the staff has all been lovely and attentive. It's a lot of hard work to get a new restaurant up and running smoothly, and they seem up to the task.

All in all, this felt well worth the wait, and I look forward to being a regular patron."}

halves with a shaving of carrot made up this dish. I really like everything about this beautiful place. I hate to complain but I was disappointed to pay twelve dollars for that salad. That said, this establishment is a most welcome addition to Sewickley and one I think will bring more and more people here. Simply put, it will be good for business. Congratulations on this newest addition to Sewickley."}
{"text":"I was blown away from the moment I walked in the doors. From the gorgeous tiled floor, to the delicately placed floral arrangements - everything was perfectly placed and staged. 

I loved this place before I even stepped up to the register. 

And then I fell in love even more: I ordered the cold brew, and I have never seen such a cool way of serving it!! (unique serving platter only served when you order the large size - 16oz). You are given a gorgeous golden plate with a large sized whiskey glass that is filled with a large square-shaped ice cube. The cold brew is placed in the most beautiful apothecary-like jar that is to be poured over the ice.  

I also ordered a yogurt-fruit parfait which was delicious from the first bite to the last.

And, as if this place wasn't cool enough, they sealed the deal by offering water options on tap: still OR sparkling!!

To top it all off: the front windows allow you to observer the hustle and bustle outside"}
{"text":"I am blown away by the perfection that is Mediterra Cafe. You can tell they took their time to make every detail perfect. From the beautiful aesthetic to the food, it's an impressive show right out of the gate. 

The place is seriously beautiful. The tile walls and floor, the perfectly curated shelves of merchandise, and the display case of delicious food. The ordering process is fairly simple too. You just wait in line, place your order and grab a number. 

I was super excited to see Gluten Free Goat bread, so I could actually have a sandwich! I was excited to order the tuna melt, but they had already pre-made the sandwiches to accommodate for their busy opening week. They came out and told me and offered to make a grilled cheese. Seriously, good problem to have, because the grilled cheese was amazing! Fontina cheese and fig spread makes for an incredible combo. 

Can I just pause for a second to talk about the sparkling water fountain!!! Okay, I'm done. But seriously, that's awesome. There's also a full coffee bar, and was excited to see there's a house made chai blend. Gotta get that next time I'm in. 

I'd love to see some more side offerings to compliment the sandwiches. But I'm sure over the next couple months they'll be tweaking the menu. My only wish was that the place had more seating and was closer to my home (that last part is just a small hint to open a cafe in Dormont)!"}
