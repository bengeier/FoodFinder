{"text":"Ambiance. Very nicely decorated and comfortable. Plenty of space and you don't feel crowded unlike a lot of other places

Food. Appetizers were great but a little pricey. Oysters were fresh and sweet. Mozarella di  Buffala was elegantly served although portions were small. The charcuterie plate was excellent. Main courses were all good. The veal bajoues was tasty but a little more gelatiny than usual and lacked salt. Others in my party had the pasta,shrimp and risotto and all had good things to say. Desserts were excellent. Donuts were a good choice and plentiful and although the Natas was to die for it was only one for $8. 

Wine. Good not great selection. Heavy on the Portuguese which is fine for me but our 3 first choices were no longer available. Expect to be gouged as usual. This is where profits are made. 

Service was excellent and attentive. Did not remember having to wait for anything and all was done with a smile. I would definitely return but have a lot more to visit in this up and coming area."}
{"text":"Came here for my last lunch in Montreal before heading back to Florida.

Had the lunch special which included an appetizer.

Very well created and presented.

Loved the olive oil and bread while we waited for our appetizer.

Also enjoyed to complimentary sparkling water.

Recommend giving this new place a try!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with service. We arrived for dinner around 7pm and the restaurant was not busy. Maybe 3-4 tables. 
They told us  the special of the day and we decided to go with the halibut. The waiter takes the order and comes back saying we can  only serve one halibut per table because they don't have many. So I was forced to change my order. I choose  the cod, bad decision. 

Wine: The menu only shows bottles, since my wife is not a big drinker,  I asked if the serve by the glass, he said yes and asked me for my preference. I told him white Sauvignon blanc and to be served when food arrives.

The starters arrived, tuna tartare and grill octopus. They octopus was okay but the tartare was out of this world.
10 minutes into my staters and still no wine, I waved him down and the waiter comes with some other wine he recommended. At this point I just need some wine so I didn't really care.

Main dishes arrive, I asked they waiter if he can bring me another 2 pcs of bread, he said sure but never go to it. 
By this time my wine glass was empty, was waiting for him to pass by @some point and I would take the opportunity to ask for a refill but he never did. So I finished my meal with water. 

Dessert: I picked a pastry , so he tells me did never made that filling today so that dessert was not available, but they have home made donuts with cognac chocolate sauce. So I tried it out, they bring 3 donuts with this minuscule container of chocolate that was only good for 1 donut. Never in my life I didn't finish a dessert, after the chocolate dip was gone , it was just a warm old fashion donuts. Not worth the calories"}

{"text":"An excellent choice for a Portuguese fusion. This place has a great vibe.  The service is excellent, ask for their reserved Portuguese wine. I loved this place"}
