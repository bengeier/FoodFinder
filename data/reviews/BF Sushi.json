{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Immediate seating and attention by staff. Chose the lunch sushi special. It arrived within 10 minutes, included miso soup, a beautiful greens salad, nicely sized sushi and roll. I especially liked that the sushi fish to rice ratio was to my liking ( too many places have a large clump of rice, this was just right). It was all delicious. Admittedly there were not many clients there so the attention we received might not be the norm. A great meal, just the right amount of food.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've had AYCE sushi at many places around Vegas/Henderson but BF Sushi is by far the best! The fish was fresh... The proportion of fish to rice was excellent, and the variety of dishes great. I started out with the baked bay scallop appetizer, which was baked scallops with bacon and cheese in a little cast iron skillet but then went on to tuna, salmon, eel, and masago nigiri where the fish extended beyond the rice underneath. The spicy scallop hand roll was the largest I've ever had (it was as big as my hand) and the specialty rolls were delicious. Definitely try the I Love Starbucks roll if you come here. (Don't worry... It doesn't have coffee in it). The staff were friendly and attentive and the decor was clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"This is the best place we have ever ate sushi! Excellent selection and customer service isgreat! The best part is -desserts are included with \"All you can eat\" .  We had fun a lot!"}
{"text":"An awesome place! Good price for all u can eat. 22$ for lunch and 27$ for dinner . Very fresh and yummy ! It's new and  Seems like not well known, since it's never busy.  Not lots of rice with sushi and in the rolls. Staff is very nice and fast. Only bad thing was the bathroom . Not always clean."}
{"text":"Great food, great service CONSISTENTLY! Their fish is so fresh!!! I'm not trying to sound clich√©, but I am 100% dedicated to this sushi restaurant. Please try this place if you haven't. I promise you won't be disappointed xo"}
{"text":"I've been hunting for a good ACYE spot for awhile now. My hunting is finally over. This is hands down my my favorite AYCE in town. The sushi was fresh and they all just melt in your mouth. It has a good ambiance and the waiters were friendly and attentive. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food! Affordable prices. They adjusted my order just the way I wanted it, and gave us extra."}
{"text":"Been on the hunt for a go-to sushi joint. Was yelping in the area and decided to check BF Sushi out. It's a huge restaurant but was slightly empty around 1pm. We were seated immediately after we arrived. Our server was very quick and attentive, and took our drink orders right away.  We opted for the A.Y.C.E (All you can eat) for lunch. Reasonable/competitive prices with those of near by sushi restaurants. Portion sizes were generous. Taste of sushi was so-so. Not great, but not bad. If you like Tuna, I would say majority of the rolls were tuna based.   While I can't say this is the go-to spot for me, I wouldn't mind coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"We found a great new sushi spot on the southwest side of town! The food is amazing and the service could not be better! They have daily sashimi specials and the Itchy Tuna on Friday night was delicious! The Yum yum and the Las Vegas Raiders rolls were two of our favorites! They serve their mussels without the shells and they did not disappoint! The restaurant is very large and inviting! We will be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. Friendly staff. Recommend Fire Cracker and Ultimate Blue Fin rolls. Very tasty and exotic looking. If you want fantastic all you can eat sushi come by."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with some friends to try out this new place. Apparently this is a sister restaurant to Blue Fin Sushi on Sunset on the east side of town and 8 Ounce KBBQ. This location took over the old spot for Kobe sushi.   I've never been to Kobe previously but the decor currently is pretty nice. Very open location with a bar (drinks) and sushi bar. We were a party of 5, with one super late as he misunderstood and drove to Egypt, i mean the east location. XD Since it was fairly early (630P) and it wasnt busy, they gave us a huge booth to sit at.   We were instantly seated after we arrived and had the waitress come to take drink orders almost immediately. Service was pretty good overall. Very attentive in terms of drinks and orders.   ---------------------  Soft Shell Crab Tempura - Half a soft shell crab per order - Not bad. Lightly battered. Served over a small salad bed.   (1 order per person for items below) Grilled Yellowtail Collar (wasn't available - sold out) Rib Eye Steak - Served on a hot plate of maybe 4-5 slices with onions - Not bad of an appetizer. Had some fatty pieces. Flavored well. Not overcooked but not exactly medium rare either Lol.  Oyster - 2 pieces per order - Huge oysters. A bit fishy in smell and taste. At least they were clean and had no sediment.   (Nigiri) Tuna, Super White Tuna, Salmon, Halibut, Ikura, Masago, Unagi, Uni (limited 1 order per person)  Overall, the nigiri were decent. The ikura was mildly \"less fresh\" than expected as the balls were a little deflated. Our 2nd order of salmon somehow became salmon belly, which was nice. Lol   Salmon avocado handroll - A LOT of salmon diced with some avocado. Friend was like, wheres the avocado? XD   Over The Rainbow - essentially otherwise known as a \"rainbow roll\". Assorted fish topped on a california roll.   (Dessert) - Supposedly its unlimited. We will see how long this lasts Lol   The ice cream mochi seems pretty decent. Mochi skin is nice and chewy. The honey toast is made with hawaiian bread with a scoop of ice cream on top. Didn't really get to try others. Saw the tempura green tea ice cream. Looked pretty decent  ---------------------  Overall, good was decent. Service was great. The rice to fish ratio is pretty decent, still incomparable to some places in Cali which is ridiculous (rice so small and fish so big, the fish can wrap around the rice completely). Fish overall is pretty fresh and clean.   Some downsides are like, hot tea is served in a pot, vs refilled as needed per cup like other places. Hot tea becomes lukewarm pretty fast unfortunately with the use of a pot for them. Convenient but loses its temperature pretty fast. The soy sauce seems to taste weird to me and my friend. I tried tasting both the green top and red top soy sauces and it seems much diluted and seemed to taste somewhat sweet? it was weird. Its at the point that we thought we should bring our own soy sauce. Price i think is a little bit higher than some competitors but is more convenient and less packed."}
{"text":"Excellent service and quality sushi! They also allow you to order half rolls so you can try a lot more variety. Their muscles are also really tasty and unique. Plus dessert is also unlimited. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Came in last week sometime and had a great experience. Service at the sushi bar was great. I ended up doing AYCE afteralll. The sushi was so fresh and wish I had room to eat more. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Sooooo Gooooood!!!! Not the most extensive menu, but everything I had was great  They also have not so common items like tobiko (flying fish egg), tako (octopus), squid, soft shell crab tempura, super white tuna, salmon AND yellowtail collar, ribeye steak... and I'm sure others that I haven't mentioned.  Would hav given 4.5 stars if there was an option. took off 1/2 a star for flavor of a few items that I'm sure weren't their fault. oysters themselves did not offer much in the taste category even though the sauce was great, also the \"no rice roll\" was wrapped with raddish instead of cucumber like the \"naruto roll\" at jjanga that i love and didn't offer much flavor, steak was only so-so but it is not a steak restaurant (what did i expect?). HOWEVER, service was Great! our orders arrived relatively quickly, everything else I tried was delicious!!! AND no extra charge for hot tea or \"fresh wasabi\". Fish to rice ratio: definitely more fish than rice  Recommendations: spicy garlic tuna sushi, salmon &/ salmon belly, tobiko with quail egg, yellowtail collar, tako...   All-in-all: good food, good service, and would return for AYCE here."}
{"text":"This place is freaking fantastic...solid food, a good variety of sushi and the atmosphere is open, clean and inviting."}
{"text":"We got the AYCE option and the rice to sushi proportion was just right. I like that there is a lot of variety for the appetizer section. The food were all good and wasn't disappointing. The only sad side was the ahi poki salad being a little too salty but other than that everything was great. The service was on time and friendly. The dessert was amazing. The money honey bread was amazing as along with the tempura ice cream in green tea. This will definitely be a go to place for sushi."}
{"text":"Oh Yum! Definatley will be going back here. Came in with a large group of 14 people & they were so on top ove everrhing it was amazing. Food came out fast& furious. Best ahi poke & uni I've ever had. Everything was so yummy but I could live on the last two alone."}
{"text":"One of the best bento boxes in town!  Love exploring new spots for work lunches and our first visit here was so good that it inspired us to come back.   This place is HUGE. It's also clean and has some fun decor touches.   The food has been really great. NOTE: my review is only based on the bento boxes during lunch time. The value is out of this world. You get so much tasty food for a very good price. Average for lunch is about $9 per person. The teriyaki chicken bento comes with a good amount of rice and chicken, side salad with ginger dressing, 4 piece Cali roll, egg roll and macaroni salad. Not into the macaroni salad so that's the only thing I don't eat.   The service is hit or miss. First time was quick and second time was extremely slow and they forgot one of our poke bowls. Third time was on the slower side as well but we got all our food. Hopefully they can staff up and everything else will fall into place."}
{"text":"Was craving for sushi, I had my husband yelp somewhere we didn't try. Very happy with his decision. I love it that it's AYCE, staff was very friendly, and it wasn't so busy. I love how their nigiri's was mostly fish and little rice like it was almost sashimi but not quite. Will be a returning customer."}
{"text":"We came for a couple of rolls and everything looked so good that we ordered from the All You Can Eat menu which as it turned out was a great value.  Unlike many all you can eat sushi restaurants this one is a little more upscale and the staff is extremely friendly.   Among the dishes we tried were the soft shell crab which was so good that we had to order a second one. Crazy Jalepeno, Screaming Orgasm, Seaweed Salad, Salmon Sashimi, a Salmon Skin Hand Roll which could and should win an award, the RM Special Roll and the Raiders Roll which was on par with the quality and award winning taste of the hand roll. The sauces and quality of all of the above was spectacular. The only dish we had that we weren't crazy about was the Rainbow Roll. It didn't look as appetizing as the rest and it had a tart taste. Not fishy. Just tart. We finished with Tempura Ice Cream. I have never tried it before and it was incredible. A must try.  We have been to other all you can eat restaurants around Las Vegas and they were all good but this experience was just a little touch above. I rarely give five stars but for an all you can eat sushi restaurant, this one deserves it."}
{"text":"My girls and I absolutely love this place. We usually get the all you can eat lunch for $21.99. You can't go wrong with any of the rolls. They'll also do the half rolls if you want to sample their menu.  Excellent service too!  Try the Go Golden Knights roll."}
{"text":"BF Sushi has just become my all time favorite sushi ayce. The service was on point I must say, the servers were super attentive. They dont rush you or give you attitude like other ayce restaurants so we can always feel comfortable eating like animals we are lol. The food was fresh and excellent, especially the uni (sea urchin), I have never tried uni so fresh before at ayce restaurant. The portion they give you here is gigantic and the plating is spectacular even though it is ayce. In conclusion, I hope this place keep its consistency since for sure we are coming back with our friends. Thanks for such an amazing meal!"}
{"text":"I've visited BF sushi twice in the last week! I love the quality of their food and their service. Tee was my waitress and was very polite. I asked her tons of questions about their menu and for recommendations. She recommended I try the \"Rock and Roll\" roll, it was definitely my favorite. It didn't have any rice, it was very light and really refreshing. I also enjoyed their tuna poke. It had really large chunks of tune and avocado which I enjoyed. Tee also recommended the tiger roll which was another favorite of mine. Another great thing about their all you can eat menu is that they allow you to order all you can eat desserts! That's a winner. I enjoyed their strawberry and vanilla ice cream and green tea mochi. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Dear sweet baby Jesus is this good sushi! If I could literally pick my house up and move it next door I would legit do so. The wait staff always greets you at the door in a fast manner. Seats are available at bar, booths, or tables. The sushi chefs are ridiculous but in a good way. They seem to get along with each other which makes for good food coming to your table. Sushi Chef Angel is like a presentation master. He's one of the reasons my  girlfriend and I go to this place. TRY THE GOLDEN KNIGHTS ROLL!! Its not just a random roll with a tending name, its probably their best roll on the menu. My mouth is literally watering right now thinking about it. All you can eat prices are on par, but the variety of rolls and items are Top 3 in Vegas Valley. Thanks guy/gals!"}
{"text":"Delicious! And greatly priced for the ambiance, staff, tasty sushi and all you can eat special."}
{"text":"I was pressed for time but i stopped in and grabbed the beef teriyaki lunch special . It was a nice portion . The special cake with miso soup, rice , teriyaki, spring roll , salad and 4 pc California roll. I will be back to try the all you can eat sushi. The my server was very attentive and polite."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about sushi. All because it's AYCE (all you can eat) doesn't mean it's good or if they have some sort of douchebaggery of rice to fish ratio. But this place is on point!   Here's the breakdown. I sat at the sushi bar & had Chef John & Chef Joseph. They were great. I've been to a lot of sushi places in Vegas, but this place impressed me with fish quality & appetizers. We came for dinner on Christmas Day.   OK, let's get to the gluttony part. And Go!  Appetizers: Hamachi Kama was so good and meaty! Oysters were fresh AF! The Sizzling Ribeye... OMG! Punch me in the face good!  Nigiri Sushi: All were AMAZING & so FRESH! Yellowtail Salmon Super White Tuna Uni Unagi Amiebi shrimp w/ deep fried heads  Dessert: We ate it ALL! Red Bean Ice Cream Hawaiian Honey Toast w/ Green Tea Ice Cream Tempura Ice Cream (Green Tea)  Btw, this is my 2nd time here. But it was lunch so I didn't get to order the specialty items. So I had to come back.   To close. This place is Tony the Tiger. \"It's Great!!!!\"  Ok bye!"}
{"text":"It was one of the best all you can eat sushi places in Las Vegas. We had great service and taste great!  We definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed having meal at BF Sushi. The food that I had was so delicious and everyone was so nice and friendly. I definitely recomend you to go to the restaurant."}
{"text":"The restaurant that used to be at this location was good but that was over a year ago and has since changed ownership. I'd give the business zero stars if I could but then I wouldn't be able to write this wonderful review.   For a restaurant that was busy and only opened a week they had a hard night to keep up...think they were overwhelmed. I DO NOT recommend this place to my parents, my best friend or anybody that I care about. The food was mediocre, the service was absolutely terrible in that it took 3 tries to get a child's order right. The kitchen staff was told by the server several times of the allergy but still failed to comply; it's been decided that they can't read or follow directions. When asked for a manager no one showed up probably because I wasn't looking straight at our server, Alvin and he chose not to listen.  We didn't ask for my child's food to be comped but he offered it anyways because of the lack of service we received, but when the bill came it was never taken off; husband forgot to check so our loss not the business. Then on the way home, I started feeling sick and now am taking care of a possible case of cross-contamination even though all food was checked prior to consumption. We will NOT be returning for lack of care, dirty tea cups and slow service and/or lack there of."}
{"text":"I've never felt so upset about a restaurants' service before! When I walked into the restaurant I liked the whole atmosphere, but I was not greeted by anyone. Waiters and waitresses kept walking past my boyfriend and I with no one greeting us or coming up to seat us.  Probably after a minute or so we were seated. The woman who sat as was very nice and had a huge smile, which kind of made of for the wait (which btw the restaurant was NOT busy) My boyfriend and I did AYCE dinner for $26.99 which is pretty average so I found nothing wrong with the prices. For our first order we ordered three appetizers and two rolls. Probably 5-10 minutes later, one appetizer and both rolls came out. I thought, \"Okay probably cos they have to cook the other two they'll be out in a bit\". Nope. We had finished everything and had waited about 20 minutes for our waitress (woman with short red & black hair) to come back to us to place another order and ask about our two appetizers missing. When she finally came around I asked her about our appetizers and she goes to the back to check (or I'm guessing put a new order in). She then never came back to tell us what happened to our food. About 10-15 minutes later (we still didn't get to order other rolls) she comes out with our two other appetizers. She almost didn't take our other order if I didn't stop her from walking away from us. After those two other rolls we ordered came out, she stopped serving us and a waiter named Ron began waiting us. He was great and I wish I could've I had gotten him in the beginning.   Overall ratings: Food: 7/10 Service: 3/10 Price: 10/10 Interior Design: 7/10"}
{"text":"Very quick and delightful service, delicious AYCE options and a wide variety of choices to choose from.  The lunch specials are the perfect size for a work lunch!"}
{"text":"Food : 4/5 for the $21.99 lunch AYCE. The fish was fresh, and you can order half rolls for most rolls. Also, they have an excellent fish to rice ratio...not trying to fill you up with rice. And, their regular lunch menu has pretty good deals ($7 - $10).  Service: 4/5. They're usually packed during lunch, but they have enough employees to keep up the pace.  And they're all pretty cool.  BF Sushi will more than likely remain on my weekly lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I yelped the nearest sushi restaurant since I'm new in town and took my kids here. They're a pretty new place and first off the service is amazing. The two gentlemen there are great forgot their names but anyway the food is also really good to me. It's a really nice setup. I highly recommend anybody and everybody to try this place out"}
{"text":"We can here for a late lunch early dinner and we were the only ones in the whole place. We always sit at the sushi bar because we like being right near the chef. We were treated so kindly and the chef (Joseph) even chatted with us, asked us our names and gave us some samples of some amazing sushi. It was very good! Super fresh! We really enjoyed it! We would totally be back more often if we didn't live so far!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch ALYCE.  Everything was very fresh and good. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love the service here.  Super friendly.  The chefs remembered to go easy on the sauce for my Nigiri orders.  The sides are great.  My favorite part is the honey toast!!"}
{"text":"Clean place but too spacious to have a warm and cozy feeling .  Very kind service- A Korean woman ( Don't know her name)   Food is not bad but not impressive   I have been to many AYCI sushi restaurants but to be honest, I had high quality sushi and other Japanese food in my country so the food of AYCI can't be so good with that price ( $22 - 27)"}
{"text":"Having to have had bad service this morning at another restaurant for breakfast, coming here for dinner with good friends made up for it. Service is great here and my main thing is that FRESH!, FRESH!, FRESH! Everything is fresh and even the sides are big portions as well. Rib eye steak on a hot grill. Hand rolls that has more fish then rice which is great! Every dish was good up to the end of our meal with desserts yum! The sushi chefs are very kind and sends out their specials if you're kind to them."}
{"text":"Used to go here when it was KOBE sushi bistro. But I have to say this place is still good! The service is fast and my wife enjoyed the sushi!"}
{"text":"6/16/18 Took my husband here for an early Fathers day dinner. Staff was friendly and attentive, food was quick to serve, place is clean, and the food was awesome. The rice ratio to sushi is true to what yelpers say. Then lastly here comes the dessert..UNLIMITED!!! Yes, all you can eat too. We had a great experience here and will return. This is one of my top 3 AYCE sushi place with great customer service. Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"Great sushi restaurant, better than before. I love Blue Fin across town. Same owners. All you can eat lunch menu is expansive with minimal limitations. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great service, fast service, great rice to raw fish ratio and the all you can eat had good portions. Definitely will be back and telling my friends."}
{"text":"I've had good experiences there in the past, but am VERY disappointed with my most recent service.  I like their tiger roll, but  I thought I'd try the Grand Canyon roll.  Menu describes it as \"In Crab Meat: Cucumber and Avocado.  Out: Dynamite on top with eel sauce.  Did not realize that \"dynamite\" means greasy mushrooms, onions and tiny shrimp.  I HATE MUSHROOMS. It was take out so I called because I was confused and just got laughed at.  Ha ha ha.  I WILL NOT BE BACK."}
{"text":"Food  Service Ambiance  What more can you ask for. Place is super clean and modern. It also has a place where you can be an Angel ~~ a must check out place.  Master Yang is extremely nice and the team there are so talented. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great Service. Fresh Sushi. Great Decor. Period! My NEW FAVORITE Sushi place... Try them, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"It took us probably 15-20 minutes between each roll in the all you can eat sushi deal. Then we waited 30 minutes before we had to flag someone down for our bill. Huge restaurant, maybe a quarter full, a lot of employees, but no one really seems like they know what they are doing."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I Love this place!  I highly suggest the all you can eat dinner! You don't have to get full rolls. If you're a taster you can get half rolls. Our server Tee was so helpful and super sweet!"}
{"text":"This spot is actually pretty good. I came here with a good friend during my visit to Vegas. It was around 10pm so the kitchen was closing an hour later so we decided to order the all you can eat sushi because it made more sense to go that route, versus trying to order all types of entrees. The best part about the AYCE is that everything is available! I had multiple miso soups. multiple bacon wrapped scallop orders, and sushi rolls on top of sushi rolls!  The waitress was amazing and gave us excellent service and made sure that we were taken care of. I'm huge on customer service, and she definitely passed that test. I would highly recommend this spot to anyone who is in search for good sushi ant a decent price."}
{"text":"From the people who brought you Blue Fin on East Sunset comes BF Sushi!!  I like to tell myself that BF stands for bestfriend and not Blue Fin.  The restaurant took over the space vacated by Kobe Sushi Bistro.  Got in a little before 6pm on a Friday night.  The place was pretty dead.  I think there was just 1 other table seated.  It looks even emptier because the restaurant is really large.  So here we are, eating our food.  Staff was super friendly and gave great service.  With our heads buried in our food and the menu, when we got up for air an hour later, we noticed that the place was more than half full.  Not too bad I thought.  The whole time people kept piling in, our level of service never changed.  Kudos for that!  We had AYCE, of course.  I was happy that they had hamachi kama, seems like a lot of AYCE places \"run out\" of it.  When our nigiri sushi arrived, I thought to myself that the pieces of fish were on the smaller side, compared to other AYCE places.  Then I lift the fish to check out the rice portion and boy was I surprised.  You get a tiny nugget of tasty sushi rice.  I'd say the fish to rice ratio was as good as it gets in the Vegas valley.   Here is a rundown of what we ordered:  APPETIZERS: baked green mussels soft shell crab tempura (half a crab per order) shrimp tempura screaming orgasm shumai (they come fried) gyoza spicy garlic edamame (very garlicy) chicken karaage (overcooked and hard) bacon scallop skewer bacon asparagus skewer salmon skin salad udon oysters  ROLLS:  blue fin special rock and roll (no rice)  NIGIRI:  garlic tuna hamachi uni amaebi (with the heads) halibut  DESSERT:  green tea tempura ice cream  Needless to say, we all left very full and very happy.  Everything is delicious, except for the chicken karaage.  I will be back and recommend this place to anyone wanting to try a solid AYCE place."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat sushi a lot. We were hoping this would be a good place since it's close to home and the ambience was great.  But we were very disappointed. The  sushi rice was very cold, undercooked and soggy. Shrimp tempura and fried shrimp heads were not crispy. It was like they pre fried it and heated up in a microwave. To top that off, our waitress Myunga was horrible. We had to ask other servers for stuff and she never checked on us. We constantly sat there waiting, drinking only our hot tea when we had them:( what a horrible experience. we will definitely not be returning!"}
{"text":"A new AYCE place in the southwest side of town. It's in the same plaza as Starbucks, Archie's, etc. On rainbow and sunset.   Likes: 1. They have yellowtail collar included in the AYCE and it was tasty (if you want this, ask first if they have it before you sit down. We asked and were told they only had one. We were there for an early dinner at 4 PM and the restaurant is supposed to be open until 11 PM. My friend stated that fact and pretty much complained and asked the waitress to check again. She finally came back and said they're cutting a new one, so we could each have one LOL). 2. All of the fish I tried tasted fresh. Uni also tasted fresh. 3. Sushi rice portion on the nigiri was on the small side. 4. They have specials (ask them). We had salmon belly and yellowtail belly. 5. They have oysters (2 per person).   Dislikes: 1. Seaweed salad tasted a bit fishy. 2. Baked mussels were awful. They cut it in half and baked it in a lot of mayo. It was flavorless and just tasted like baked mayonnaise.  Lunch is $21.99 and dinner is $26.99. Service is all around good. The place is spacious and looks really clean.   I don't do too much AYCE sushi anymore, but if I have to, I will choose to eat here again."}
{"text":"I order very often from this restaurants via amazon Restaurant. Today I order Crazy Jalape√±o, Crispy Rice Spicy Tuna, Happy Ending , and Gangnam Style Both Rolls withextra Sauce as you can see in my order request photo all in caps. When my 55.00 dollar order gets deliver all the sauce I had was 1 eel sauce, 1 spicy siracha sauce and 1 spicy mayo. The screaming O sauce for my favorite roll Gangnam Style was missing.  Very upsetting. Quality since to be going down with their attention to detail. Not the first time they forget something. Quality assurance for delivery is disappointing. I called the restaurant and they said they would give me something free next time.  I DONT WANT ANYTHING FREE, I just want my order RIGHT the first time."}
{"text":"Took my Husband here yesterday for an early Father's Day dinner... Food was really good. The remodel was amazing! This spot has so much potential, all they need is a Bartender, so you can have the option to sit at bar and maybe a few local artist to come in and add to their art wall, it's almost like a chalkboard, but it was maybe like six panels and only one had a set off wings on it....But we will definitely be back!!!! Service was great!"}
{"text":"This is my new sushi spot from the screaming o' to the ribeye to the sushi my favorite is the solana roll I prefer this place over umiya now literally the same menu but they give more and it taste better also nicer interior in restaurant, thanks guys be back soon !"}
{"text":"My boss treated me to a birthday dinner at BF sushi. Our waitress was Tee and she was phenomenal. My boss isn't an avid sushi eater so she asked Tee a lot of questions and for recommendations. Tee was incredibly patient and informative and all of her suggestions were delicious. Our absolute favorite was the rock and roll roll (it has no rice). Oh man, the flavors were awesome. You could tell the fish was fresh and each flavor complimented another. We orders two of those! I wasn't a fan of their baked green mussels. I like cheese but their version was too cheesy for me so I just ate the mussels. The mussels were good and I definitely enjoyed them. My favorite thing about their menu is the all you can eat dessert which includes mochi ice cream! Ugh, every single sushi restaurant I've visited has limited the mochi to just one serving but BF sushi lets you order as many as you'd like. I had their strawberry and mango and enjoyed both flavors. My boss orders their strawberry and vanilla ice cream dessert and damn near licked the bowl so I'd say she enjoyed it. Ask for their fresh wasabi, it's AMAZING. First time I've had fresh wasabi and it's a totally different experience which I recommend you try. Overall, I'd definitely go back and hope that Tee is my waitress."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Las Vegas!!! Always great service from hostess at door to the chef at bar! The fish is always fresh, I've never had a bad bite of fish here! They have a very wide selection of different fish/rolls and drinks! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND trying this restaurant!!!! I have been to more than a dozen Sushi Restaurants in Las Vegas from China town to the nicest casinos. And the most important thing is that it is the cleanest Sushi bar I have ever been to!"}
{"text":"I came in during my lunch break, they weren't very busy and they looked well staffed, my TO GO order took 25/30 mins and I ordered 2 classic rolls which I don't think is much...when I asked how much longer it would take the guy that was \"helping\" me asked me twice what I ordered and looked like he forgot and flustered. Very annoying when someone comes in on a lunch break. Needless to say the service was crap and for that only reason I will not be returning even if the food is good (which was mediocre)...."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place in Town,  excellent service, amazing food,  friendly staff. We definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"The phone now works, but still takes a few rings to get an answer."}
{"text":"Poor service. 2 out of 5 plates came out right away and the remaining 3 were over an hour. This was our lunch break and the orders had to be made to take out.."}
{"text":"This place is great and I drive 35 min out of the way to have their sushi.  The waiters Ron/Jen were very helpful and attentive to my party's needs. The sushi came out quick and damn it was delicious.  You have to try the mackerel ane their hawaiian bread.   Great vibe and atmosphere. Def recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Customer service 10 Food 10 Cleanliness 10 The fact their all u can eat is weird 0  U can't do half rolls on ANYTHING deep fried and their NOT deep fried choices are mad limited.  So if you're going and you're are NOT planning on all you can eat then this may be your place!   Otherwise if you're looking for AYCE it's not good!"}
{"text":"Hello! First of all, I don't mean to be rude. I try to give a very fair review whenever I can.  In summary, we came here to get the AYCE at lunch time. The rice on sushi and rolls were very inconsistent. The service was also inconsistent.   To further explain my experience, the rice we had initially or our first 3-4 rolls/nigiri were very wet. Meaning that you cant even distinguish the rice pieces individually as they were mushy. I am not a pro sushi chef but I think that's not the way it should be. And then, we ordered a few more nigiri and the rice in there was undercooked. You could see the individual rice pieces, but at the same time was very chewy and hard to eat cause the fish is long gone before you can swallow the rice(the rice serving wasn't even that much).   As for the service, we had 2 orders taken in our first 30mins. After that, we had to wait 30mins to get an attention from one of the employees. My mom literally had to hand out a piece of paper containing our written order to their manager because nobody else would pay attention to us. It was my first time to experience a service where all the staff ignores you. They might've not done it intentionally, but that's how they treated us.  On the good side, this resto has a very good fish quality. Very fresh and not overseasoned.  Edit: To add to my statement, the other customers which didn't have AYCE got better service. So, please be mindful when coming here to get AYCE."}
{"text":"Really, the best sushi in the SW valley. Maybe in Vegas! Another visit with wonderful service from Tee, and the rest of their staff.   Their fried tempura is the best I've ever had.   Of course you can't go wrong with any of their nigiris and appetizers.   I also love a place that do half orders! I'm not sure if they do it for every roll, but the ones we ordered they were able to do so.   Thank you for another great experience!"}
{"text":"For now BF sushi in best all you can eat sushi in Las Vegas. Price is regular price for all you can eat. But the don't put a lot of rice so you can eat more fish  Also they do have many kind of appetizer too :)"}
{"text":"I have my go-to spot for the days I am craving AYCE sushi for lunch, and it's always a struggle for me to try a new place when my normal spot is so solid..   And it doesn't help that the last time I tried a new AYCE sushi spot I was far from impressed...   When I learned that BF Sushi took over the old Kobe Sushi location on Rainbow I was cautiously curious, when I realized the BF was in reference to Blue Fin Sushi on Sunset I was convinced to give it a try... and I am SO glad I did. A coworker and I had AYCE lunch at BF Sushi on a recent Friday afternoon.  Everything that bothered me about the last all you can eat sushi spot I tried was a non-issue here.  -1/2 rolls available? Check. -All You Can Eat sushi menu just as diverse as the a la carte menu? Check.  -Dessert included with AYCE? Check.   The items that we ordered were all excellent. I was happy to see the riceless roll I enjoyed at Blue Fin on the menu at BF. Awesome fish to rice ratio on the nigiri sushi. Make sure to get the honey toast for dessert!   Service was excellent. Our main waiter had a great personality and the people that were supporting him were efficent and friendly. Drinks were refilled quickly and we had no long waits in between the items that we ordered. Empty plates removed from table in a timely manner.   I am very pleased that we didn't decide to play it safe and go to our normal sushi spot for lunch, BF Sushi is legit and I will definitely be back.  Yelp Reviews 2018 15/100"}
{"text":"Love this place!! The food is excellent (just like their original location across town at Blue Fin) and comes out quickly.  Unlike their competitor up the street, they use fresh, real ingredients (no imitation meat!) and you don't have to wait forever to get your food. The restaurant is classy and spacious. Keep telling everyone I know to stop going up the street and come here instead because it is so much better. Hoping that word of mouth will spread and this place will do really well because it deserves to be a success!!"}
{"text":"The food is always good but I can't go back anymore as the service is always bad. The waitresses are all friendly but nobody seems to know what they are doing when you order food. If the place is empty then it's a great meal and service but they can't handle it if they have more than 5 tables. You wait and wait and hope for your food to come. After last night , and my 20th time there  ... I'm done coming here !  Ordered all you can eat and after a hour 20 min only some of my 5 people in our group got food. We kept having to re order to be told after a hour they are out of what we ordered. In the end we hardly ate as I kept asking for our food. The waitress was super nice and apologized again and again and offered what she can do for us , I kept saying please just bring us food we ordered and she kept coming back with excuses. I finally said charge us for just one person all you can eat as they are the only one that got food. We asked for bill and left. This has happened too often there and I can't go back again. But the food is good that's the sad part."}
{"text":"My wife and I invited our friend for dinner at this place a week ago (totally forgot to Yelp.) when we originally invited our friend for sushi, we thought we were going to Kobe Sushi, but when we arrived it was BF Sushi. Clearly we haven't been to that place in a while.   When we arrived, we were seated right away. The place was empty when we arrived. We have dinner pretty early. Service was great. Very attentive. The only thing that stood out was I had asked for Asahi beer because I saw on the table sign they had it on draft. I love draft beer! The server brought out the bottled beer. I was confused, but didn't say anything. The second time around, I was specific and asked for a draft asahi. To me, I think she should've asked for my preference in the beginning. That's just me though :)   The rolls were delicious. I enjoyed each one. Wish I remembered the rolls we ordered.   I definitely recommend and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi I'm here now writing this review ! We are regulars here and we have our favorite waitress she is the best ! Please come here and enjoy !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try a new sushi joint because we were getting tired of the same one we've been going to. We did try one close to us but gosh damn they didn't even give us time to order. Like they wanted you in and out. SO, we ended up here and absolutely love it. They offer AYCE AND unlimited dessert. We love the decor and the atmosphere in the restaurant. The staff are also kind and they don't rush you at all."}
{"text":"This is our second time coming here and it was just as great as our first time! The garlic tuna is so fresh! The staff expedited our food and the new restaurant is classy and clean!! Love this new spot !!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. So fresh. Possibly the best all you can eat I've ever had.    Tuna poke spicy with a ton of fresh tuna.  Super white tuna and garlic tuna AMAZING   Rock and Roll was great.   Everything was super fresh and so reasonable plus they give you 90 min which is better then other places.  I will go back. So good."}
{"text":"BF sushi used to be kobe and th re-opening of this place is sooooooo much better!!  We had an early dinner (monday 4pm) only couple of tables were there.,   Service was tremendous and the food was sent out quick!   The nigiri were made perfect meaning it does not break the whole fish covers the rice (i like it coz the rice was not too small but small enough to enjoy a lot of nigiri!!!) and its great quality seafood.  We also had oysters  Softshell crab Baked mussels  Coconut shrimp  and Las Vegas raider roll   Everything was good!!!  Will definitely be back on our next sushi night."}
{"text":"This is seriously my favorite sushi spot! Ron is the best! Thank you so much for your hospitality. The rib eye appetizer is beyond delicious especially paired with the oysters!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this new sushi joint in the southwest area. And IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!! Another go to place for date nite or family dining! Ambiance is super nice, with a very modern vibe. Very up to date murals. Huge place to accommodate a nice group party. (Will consider this as a venue for a party) We are still trying to explore the menu, but pretty impressed with their selection already.   We got here around 8pm, and i must say that their fish selection is pretty fresh. Tons of appetizers to choose from! The Nigiri is yummy and has awesome fish and rice ratio, so that's always good. Tons of rolls to choose from too! You can order them half. My favorite is the Las Vegas raiders, and coco. They have daily sashimi special included in the AYCE. Monday, is the white tuna sashimi nite, tastes bomb! Desserts are unlimited so make sure you save a space for that!!!   Apart from how the ambiance is, I liked this place because they have such a great presentation of everything, appetizers to dessert! I wish I took a photo of every single one to show it off!  Very classy!   Lastly, the service is 5   I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Came in around 1:30 on a Tuesday afternoon. It wasn't packed but a couple of tables were occupied & a couple of bar stools were taken. We were seated promptly & given waters. We were waiting for one more person so they kindly waited to take our order.   We ordered a variety of nigiri, sides, and rolls. I think my favorite from the nigiri menu is the garlic tuna & garlic yellowtail. That garlic sauce on top really adds wonderful flavor to the fish. I wouldn't say everything tasted super fresh... but it wasn't bad. The fish to rice ratio is ideal but some of the rice was really dry. I tried the spicy salmon tar tar cos I saw some raving reviews about it. However, i wasn't a fan. It needed something else on it? Idk, but it lacked a certain something. They have a good amount of desserts but can't order more than one.   The service was good though! They were on top of giving us refills & taking our order."}
{"text":"While this location is new, all those new location kinks are non existent. The fish is fresh and the food is delicious. The service is top notch. Not one time did we have to ask for anything. Great experience. I would come again."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi in town, everything is fresh and tasty. Lots of seats, parking spot, nice environment"}
{"text":"Sushi was great and fresh, I definitely recommend trying their oysters. Esther was our server and she was amazing. You can tell she loves her job. The food was amazing but I would definitely go back just for Esther because her customer service was phenomenal."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch AYCE.  Servers were friendly and fast.  Nice interior and atmosphere.  I would definitely come back here again.  Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service; Our waitress Tee was very kind and attentive! We had many questions (probably too many) and she answered them all with clarity. Probably one of the best service I've ever received. The sushi is also great with reasonable prices and portions. Will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Came in with my SO, definitely enjoyed their AYCE for dinner.   They offer half-rolls on most of the non-baked stuff so you don't over commit and get to enjoy more of their offerings without getting full on their rice.  Favorite dishes: uni (one per person with ayce), ribeye steak, yellow tail collar, yellow tail hand roll, Blue Fin Special, Over the Rainbow, Hawaiian Honey Bread dessert and Rock and Roll (fresh and no rice!)  Liked: service, interior design, clean bathroom  Disliked: Gangnam style roll (it was swimming in a weird sauce that wasn't enyoyable) and their tempura ice cream (the green tea ice cream was icy, and tasted watered down)  Will definitely come back the next time I have a AYCE sushi craving!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! My first time here and I was blown away!! Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This place has the best quality of sushi and service. It is way better than just regular sushi restaurants. I guarantee you'll love this place"}
{"text":"We decided to try this new ayce sushi place And now this probably will be one of my favorite ayce sushi places!! This place recent opened so not alot of people know about but definitely worth the price! Their service n food was being expectations! The rice to fish ratio was perfect. Not too much rice at all. Everything was so fresh and the best part that catches my eyes is their yellow tail collar!! So juicy and big. When I go to sushi places, yellowtail collar is one of the main dish that catches my eyes. I recommended for people to try it out there if you are looking for a sushi place."}
{"text":"First impression: very nice, clean, casual date night spot. Nice ambience for evening dining.  Ordered: Royal Veggie roll - Delicious, I'm glad it's the right ratio of cream cheese and veggies. Supreme Veggie roll - Delicious, good ratio of rice and veggie and I like the green soy paper Dynamite- Good... lots of mushrooms  Yellowtail Collarbone Grilled - this was amazing not too dry and crispy on the outside  Mochi - green tea, small but just right! Hawaiiian Honey Bread with green tea - AMAZING!!!! Please try!"}
{"text":"First off, BF sushi is substantially better than the restaurant that it replaced.  I think everyone nearby appreciates the upgrade.  Interior decor: 5 Star Service: 5 Star Lunch special price: 5 Star Food: 3 Stars  The new restaurant has this modern and cool kind of look.  It's probably the nicest restaurant in the entire plaza.  It's also super clean, which is an important consideration for a sushi joint.    Service was also prompt.  The servers made frequent rounds and picked up spiked plates and trash moments after I was done.  They were also discreet when they came by.  Just close enough if I needed by not so close that it felt intrusive.  It was the kind of place where everyone helps out - so when my main server was busy, another one would walk by and take a peak to see if I needed anything.  Dare I say service here was comparable to a five star resort.  I had the two roll lunch special, which was a selection of two rolls, miso soup, and salad for $8.99.  Considering that's how much it costs for a large cold sandwich elsewhere in the plaza, I'd call it a pretty sweet deal.    I ordered the California roll and salmon roll as my two sushi choices.  Unfortunately food is where BF failed to impress.  For some reason, the rice had a very powdery texture, it kind of just disintegrated into tiny chunks.  I did not enjoy that.  For the salmon roll, the salmon portion size was great, but the salmon itself was really chewy.  The California roll was..well... imitation crab, cucumber, and avocado, so no way to mess that up.  Overall I would probably come back again simply because I work in the plaza and it would be awesome to have sushi for lunch once in a while."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  I was very glad to see it wasn't cramped inside. Unlike other places when 2 or 3 parties come in, the service gets slow and food starts coming out slow.  This was not the case here at all.  The place was very spacious, very nice decor, and food came out at a steady pace.   Service: Fast Friendly Accurate My iced green tea was not only delicious and was a nice dark green (not watered down) and it stayed filled.  The menu had a very nice variety to choose from, and I liked that it was not copied from other places.  They do make half rolls upon request. They also had their own unique rolls to pick from without it all just being crab meat.    Beware though if you try the crispy rice cracker spicy tuna appetizer, it's really good but it's sort of a big portion for an appetizer.    Quality and taste was excellent.  Sushi chef's were fast too.  I was a little disappointed that they don't have a stamp card but it's not a deal breaker by any means.    I absolutely recommend trying this place.  I will DEFINITELY be back.    Thank you BF Sushi for a really good dinner!"}
{"text":"our new AYCE sushi place! the place look cozy... awesome staff and flavorful rolls.. if you live in the SW area... this is the spot for sushi!"}
{"text":"Great dinner with my family tonight! We were a party of 11 and all enjoyed the fresh fish and fantastic service.   I have to say the uni was spectacular.   We usually go to Jjanga, but  decided to try a new spot since our last experience there was disappointing. Glad we tried it. Now we have a new favorite AYCE sushi place!"}
{"text":"If you can, sit at the bar, Chef John is awesome, definitely knows what he's doing and takes good care of the customers, even my aunt who never ate raw fish enjoyed her dinner and was pretty happy. Food is fresh, service is good, will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"So, I guess this place is the sister(brother?) location of Blue Fin sushi in SouthEast part of town... my wife and I have been to that other location and thought it was very good. We went to BF the other day and had no idea the two were related. For starters, the inside is huuuuge, or at least it felt huge. It is nicely decorated, clean, etc... they do have AYCE. As stated by another reviewer previously, the menu isn't extensive but the quality makes up for it. You are allow d to order half rolls for most items which allows you to try more than you usually would. They have Spicy Garlic Tuna which was incredible. We had a few rolls, goyza, salmon, tuna, and a couple drinks. Rolls were delicious, sushi cuts of fish to rice ratio was very impressive. The non-AYCE places I have been to have huge cuts of fish and a thimble of rice underneath. BF Sushi was right in line with that, I couldn't believe how big the fish cuts were for AYCE. Service was great and friendly as well and very attentive. The only issue, and maybe it was just completely me, but I was charged for a club soda. Not a Perrier or Pellegrino, but a carbonated water from their gun. I don't believe I have ever been charged for a club soda from the beverage gun before so I found that a bit strange... other than that a great experience and would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Fish is good :) Rice is not :/ Service not great :(    So: Umiya, sushi way, sushimon, oyshi sushi"}
{"text":"I'm a sushi aficionado, I seek sushi bars all over the county...  excellent experience.   John at the sushi bar was fantastic,  he made a custom dish that he caked \"the kiss\", not to be missed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite ayce sushi places!!! Their fish to rice proportion is almost always perfect when it comes to their nigiri because there is more fish than there is rice which is the way it's supposed to be! I have not tried any of their rolls yet because I actually only go for their nigiri and appetizers and I love the fact that they have a large appetizer variety as well.  On top of that, the service has always been great. All the waiters are always so kind and patient with my party and I especially since I always go with 3-4 people and we order a ton! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's nice right when you walk through the door, but it's too bright. The music is annoying, the tables are too close to each other. I don't think this place is going to fill up.   The prices are resonable. I ordered the Blue Fin special and it was boring!! It had no flavor to it. The Cajun Albacore they used it's like they smothered it in a mexican seasoning. It ruined the roll! My friend got the Over The Rainbow roll and she also said it was boring. Also the sushi rolls just completely fell apart!!! They weren't rolled tight enough. We still ate it though because we were hungry. I wouldn't come back here. I love sushi and this is by far the second worst place I have come to! I was so excited for this place to open up and I regret making this decision.  They also were ALL on their phones just out in the open so we could see! I know there's something to do then just standing at the counter looking down at your mobile device."}
{"text":"I eat sushi all the time and everywhere and since I ate at BF Sushi I got food poisoning. Have not ate for 2 days and have been throwing up non stop!  Had very high hopes for this all you can eat joint to be a new go to for me.  I was very excited to try it before it got busy. So my friend and I went for a early dinner and it wasn't busy at all.  First sat down the servers were very attentive, I would still be eating a bunch of food and they would continue to ask if we wanted to order more, which is fine with me.  But somewhere in the middle of dinner we decided to order 2 strawberry margaritas since we haven't seen each other and we decided why not.  Order the drinks, the server repeated it back to us and we never saw the drinks or anyone at the bar making them. Also they never got our orders right.  We would order 3 orders each of nigiri and 1 would only come out every time."}
{"text":"Upon first entering, I was surprised at how big this place is! Decor is very nice. It's wide open with a huge bar in the corner. We were seated right away.   When we sat down, I was pleasantly surprised at the menu selection. It reminded me of the very popular Goyemon. My husband asked if they could sear a lot of the fish since I'm pregnant and shouldn't be eating raw. And the waiter said, of course! What a game changer! I've never been to a restaurant that was so accommodating. Basically, they would prepare 2/3 of a dish raw, and sear a bit of it for me. Isn't that great?!  Not only was the selection great, but the quality of the rolls, and nigiri was delicious! The rice was tiny and the pieces were small. This is great in an AYCE so you can have room to try a lot of other things. The fish was super fresh as well.   I also need to commend the service. We ordered and the food came out within 5-10 mins I think! Empty plates never sat on the table very long. And the waiter kept coming to check on us. We felt so special!   First visit and BF Sushi is already my favorite AYCE in Vegas! Way better than a lot of the older more popular ones around town. And since the restaurant space is huge, the wait time is negligible.   Love this place. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I came in on a Friday afternoon @12 and opted for the AYCE lunch because I normally just order a lot of nigiri and some kind of salad and I usually get my money's worth.   Today I ordered several different nigiri, Over The Rainbow roll and salmon skin salad. The sushi chef offered me a yellowtail sashimi special on the house which was quite tasty! The fish to rice ratio was perfect. It was probably only about less than tablespoon or so of rice to the fish which were good portions as well. I didn't care too much for the salmon skin salad. It actually tasted burnt and I can still taste the burnt charcoal taste in my mouth after downing water and eating more sushi. The over the rainbow roll was perfect. Variety of fish and not overwhelmed by too much sauce or rice.   The staff was very attentive and followed up with me often. I was able to get in and out during my lunch break. It's a short drive to and from my office so will likely be back again."}
{"text":"This is probably the best sushi restaurant I've had in Las Vegas.  Excellent presentation, excellent service, and excellent selection of fish.  Will definitely be telling my friends and family about this place and will be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try the ayce here. The quality of fish was actually pretty great! The rice to fish ratio was also really good. We ate a looot of sushi. The only downside was how greasy the fried food was. We could not eat our shrimp tempura or the bacon scallop skewers,  it felt like drinking oil. The desserts were good, gotta love the honey toast. We would definitely come back here again, just no fried foods!"}
{"text":"I live in Southwest so I decided to try BF Sushi that's only 10 min away from my house. First time, I went there for a dinner. Sushi chefs are super friendly and they had a large selection on the menu. Service speed was decent, and my Sashimi was fresh. I visited again with a group of 10 people. Again I had great food and great time with my friends. So I visited again for a lunch. Their lunch menu price is very decent. You get a great amount of tasty food for what you pay. I feel that this restaurant is the best all-you-can-eat (AYCE) sushi restaurant in Southwest."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The new ownership has really changed the food quality around."}
{"text":"The service is excellent here! Very attentive and friendly! Orange Blossom and Rock & Roll were my favorite rolls. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best sushi i have had in a long time...i would recommend this place to any sushi fan."}
{"text":"Came here to try this new sushi spot and compare it to other all you can eat restaurants.   When we walked in we were not greeted right away and since there was a sign that said wait to be seated we waited for someone to come seat us. After a few minutes someone came to seat us and asked right away whether or not we were doing all you can eat.   We chose to do all you can eat and ordered green tea for our drinks. It took a little longer than we expected for someone to bring us our drinks and take our order.   I thought the nigiri to rice ratio was generous compared to other all you can places. The yellow tail nigiri was my favorite. I also thought they gave a really generous portion of the salmon skin salad. The desserts we're not limited to one dessert per person which was nice when compared to other sushi restaurants.   Overall, the rice on each nigiri piece was not overwhelming which was great. The appetizers we ordered were really good and the salad we ordered was a good size. I did not however like how our server basically left us mid meal and we had to flag some other server down to take our next order and to even get some water."}
