{"text":"When reading the reviews take a moment to look at the dates. New ownership and overhaul of the food, menu, and layout, so don't hold the new owners responsible for the faults of someone before they took over.
Poutine was excellent. Fries were perfectly browned and fresh cut, the gravy was the right balance between rich, salty with onion notes, with chunks of cheese curd generously spread on top. I have to imagine if you're Canadian this is going to be closer to home than the americanized versions that other places try to replicate. Authenticity counts!
I've been here twice for the breakfast bagels since the new owners took over and it's a marked improvement. I like over-easy yolks on my bagel sandwiches.  This is the only place in Henderson I've found that will actually do that properly! Einsteins advertises their \"fresh cracked eggs\" but it's still just a microwaved egg. This place grills everything to order and so far has gotten it right both times. 
Excellent service and affordable. I'm going to go back next week to try the cheesesteak..."}
{"text":"Bought bagels at 8am on a Sunday, there's no way they were made the same day...dry & stiff, the entire half dozen of them"}
{"text":"Amazing family owned bakery! Ordered two bagels and tried the Mediterranean pizza! We loved it so much the nice old man brought us another for free! Love this place and will come back :)"}
{"text":"This place looked like I should give it a shot. However, they only had a few shmears, and most of the bagels weren't out on display. 

On top of that they let this other couple cut in front of me in line. They were about 60ish so I didn't say anything, but seriously- what the hell is that about? Won't be back. Ever.

Update: we actually decided to go to einsteins bagels because we didn't have any clue how much longer it would be and no one told us."}
{"text":"I just love the staff here! Susan and her husband really make you feel like family. They cook REAL down-home food that makes you feel good and is really delicious. They also have some of the best coffee I've ever had. It takes time sure, but its the best breakfast spot in Henderson if your craving a taste of home."}
{"text":"Heard this place was under new ownership. Decided to come here for lunch. My husband ordered some poutine and I stuck to my favorite kinda food--breakfast. Food tastes fantastic, and service is top notch. Poutine was authentically made, gravy on it was yummy! My eggs were made exactly how I like them, and it came with bacon and some fruit salad. I would definitely come here again. Everyone should give them a try! (Plus, I didn't have room but they said they make their bagels fresh, on site daily, so I am going to come back to try those!)"}
{"text":"Words can not describe how bad the \"beagles\" here are. Awful, terrible disgusting, say whatever you want, it's not negative enough. What a huge disappointment !!!!!"}
{"text":"My niece from Wisconsin and I took a road trip to Nevada. It was her first time going to Vegas. Before we got to the Vegas strip we stopped to have breakfast in a city called Henderson. There was a plaza with Starbucks, bagel shop, baskin robbins, and more. It was a nice plaza. 

We noticed people coming out with bags of bagels from Henderson Fresh Bakery. I must say this has been my first bagel shop where I enjoyed eating the Loax bagel. My niece got a muffin and a few eclairs. The muffin was very tasty and the eclairs were to die for. :)

Will be coming back soon :)))"}
{"text":"Quality of the bagels is awful. Also in the mornings, questionably the busiest time of the day for a bagel place, there is only 1 person working there so it takes forever to get your food. 

Can someone just plz just open a decent bagel spot in Henderson?"}
{"text":"Salmon and capers, oh and pastries! Oh yes. Was in town visiting family and stumbled upon this place. I loved it, brought back a box for the family and it was gone that afternoon. I'm not always around, but I'll be back here for sure."}
{"text":"I really hate writing bad reviews. I try to be fair and see the positive side of most things, but this place is just bad. Slow service, tasteless food, and overpriced. 

I've come here three times total and every single time the service has been so slow it's comical. Now that I sit here and actually think about this past Sunday's interaction, it resembles a Portlandia skit minus the millennial hipster ego. 

My fiancée and I ordered two of the same bagel sandwiches, but mine with sausage and hers with bacon. Shortly after ordering, we paid, sat down and watched three more couples walk in and do the same thing. After about 15 minutes of conversation and smartphone gazing, we both started to look at the time and realized we're still waiting on two basic bagel breakfast sandwiches, \"Order up!\" we look up only to see the couple who came in immediately after us get there bagel sandwiches. Ok, maybe their order was just bagels and cream cheese? Then another couple gets called, they grab their food and leave, then another few minutes pass by and few a more customers get their food. 

My fiancé walks up to the counter and asked about our food and also mentions that last three people had all come in after us, \"No, no, they were here before you\" Is what she's told, \"Umm... no that's not true, but is our order almost ready?\" \"just a few more minutes\". After about ten more minutes, our order is finally ready. 

Two bagel sandwiches took over thirty-minutes and the best part is that both of our orders were wrong, no sausage for me and only one slice of bacon on my sandwich, my fiancé didn't get any bacon, they put hers in a separate piece of foil and then put it on top of the bagels, whaaa?

See the pic of the bagel I waited thirty minutes for, derp."}
{"text":"Came in today for a bagel...no longer make salt or garlic bagels. I'm Jewish. What's the point of having a bagel place when you can't satisfy the clientel. Guess it's back to Smith's, Einstein's and Vons for bagels. The variety is less than and a disappointment again. Sad."}
{"text":"A midst the poor reviews, I felt like I needed to up the ante following a delightful little lunch I just enjoyed here with my fiancé and his daughter. First off, one of the most noticeable things about Fresh is how impeccably clean the entire place is. That is hugely important when it comes to food service. Every surface is noticeably clean. Although the menu is small and apparently dialed down from the previous Layers menu, it is simple. I like simple. It makes choosing easier. Plus they have a good variety of options perfectly suiting a small cafe such as this. The food took a couple of long minutes to come out to us, which shows to me that care and concern was put into the preparation. That care and concern was noticeable when the plates (delivered to us by a very kind employee) arrived to our cute table. \"Cute chairs too!\" Says Olivia. The food was put together in a simple and beautiful presentation on the plate. Something I always look for. And the food was very tasty! Again, simple. But very FRESH! My fiancé and I both had the hummus and quinoa wrap and mine came out with the omission of tomatoes, as I had requested. It was very tasty and I quite enjoyed the dressing on the little side salad. Olivia had a turkey sandwich (also with multiple omissions, that were also handled perfectly) and she darned near cleaned her plate. She is a teenager, so that is rare!  
All in all, I am impressed and feel this place deserves more stars than what is reflected. I will return!

P.S. Bryan says it is okay if the rest of you don't like it so that means there will be no lines and plenty of food when we come here again!! Just kidding please come and support local businesses!"}
{"text":"Nothing has changed here since it was Brooklyn  Bagels. I am bummed because I was so looking forward to the opening of this place with the hopes of getting a decent bagel locally and was hoping it was going to be a full bakery since the name is Henderson Bakery."}
{"text":"If you charge .99 for a bagel then have the balls to charge 2.99 for adding cream cheese, put 2 bucks worth of it on there, I mean wtf am I spending 2x the cost of the bagel for you to cut it and add a spread to it?

The bagel was mediocre and the cream cheese was not great either, still looked like the Brooklyn Bagel before as if they cloned the menu 

Doubt I would go back, can get a bagel just as good at tropical smoothie cafe or Starbucks next to this place, if you want a sandwich maybe it's ok, I won't rush back"}
{"text":"This place is so good!!! I've been looking for a breakfast place like this since I moved from Boston. I'm glad I stopped in and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the breakfast platter and I got my husband the Steak & Egg Wrap. Everyone working behind the counter seemed to be a little confused and when I ordered my food, the woman kept looking at the menu to see what I ordered and what what it came with... weird.  Overall the food tasted ok, except for the eggs, which I noticed came from some sort of liquid eggs milk carton... are liquid eggs really that much cheaper than an actual carton of eggs? Either way, I was a little grossed out. Also, by the time I got my food the toast was a little rubbery. I guess if you're hung over from the night before this would be great greasy drunk food."}
{"text":"Come and try Henderson fresh bakery. Everything is fresh and tastes amazing. Try the bagels, try the fresh cooked breakfast, grab a muffin and coffee to go or some of the pastries."}
{"text":"Went in when they opened this am expecting my bagel to be fresh. Bought a cup of coffee and bagel and cream cheese $5.35.  I couldn't even eat the bagel it was def not fresh. Too bad Starbucks closed in that area. I would have gone there"}
{"text":"It would be a zero star rating in my book but then I wouldn't be able to write this review. I came in to order 2 dozen bagels. The woman told me it would take a little while so I could go get coffee or do whatever else I needed to do and come back. WHAT IN THE WORLD?  I didn't order custom bagels. How hard is it to shove bagels in a bag?

I told her I wanted 12 in each bag. She said she had to do my cream cheese and I could separate them myself. When I said that I'd prefer not to touch each bagel with my hands, she handed me gloves and put me to work. She then went on to complain about being short handed. \"Please be understanding,\" she said, \"...these things happen\". By \"things\", if you mean giving the worst service ever and stressing the customer out with your issues... then no, I'm pretty sure that rarely happens.

I was then overcharged by 2 tubs of cream cheese and she kind of argued when I questioned it. 

The bagels are small and taste like cardboard. I don't think Henderson Fresh Bagels has ever seen a \"fresh\" bagel in its life. I'd rather get bagels at the supermarket. From now on, I will go out of my way to Einstein."}
{"text":"So glad to have a local bakery back in business again!  :-)  I'm thrilled to see that my breakfast sandwich is still on the menu...  can't wait for them to finish remodeling to try out the new pastries!  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! Took awhile to even get greeted. They were so worried about their trainee. Waited for 20 minutes for 2 bagels. Never again."}
