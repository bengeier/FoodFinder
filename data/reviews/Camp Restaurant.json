{"text":"Camp does a lot of things really well.  The decor of the place is fun and quirky, the wait staff is super friendly, and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Welcoming, friendly, homey feel! 

The name \"Camp\" sold it for me but it has more of a cottage on the lake feel with kitchy art, old school trinkets and games on display. They even have rolls of gimp and the beer taps come out of a toy model Winnebago they call Beerebago. 

I've only ever had the breakfast burrito and caffee Americano.  Super tasty and filling! 
They always seem to have a lots of additional menu items. I have brought many friends here and all have enjoyed the unique and warm atmosphere plus the food. 

The place is small and gets busy on weekends but the staff are extremely friendly and make you feel like you're a regular."}
{"text":"Camp makes me sad.
It has great decor, great potential, is in an area that desperately needs more cafes and restaurants, and yet it just fails to perform. 

We first went to Camp just after it opened, and were happy to put up with a few bumps in food consistency and service for a place that was still getting into its own groove. But it's been there a while now and after our last visit, I doubt--despite desperately wanting a place like this to succeed in the area--that we will go back. 
Seated in the middle of the restaurant, we could hear both the restaurant music and the kitchen music. Great this place wants a home vibe, but I shouldn't feel like their teenager is pumping music from another room while I eat. I would have gladly listened to either the slow pop of the restaurant or the bizarre love triangle being pumped from the back, but both, no thanks. It leant the feeling that no one was really worried about our experience as long as they had the tunes on front and back that they enjoyed.

The food took ages and no one seemed bothered that we were waiting and waiting. How can 4 meals that don't involve any cooking other than a toaster take so long? When they did arrive, they looked for the most part lovely, but were so, so very bland. Even a liberal dosing of salt and pepper did little to make my quiche taste like anything at all. It wasn't \"bad\" as in it didn't taste unpalatable, it simply just didn't have any taste or flavour to it at all. Nothing. I was actually amazed eggs could be made tasteless, I don't know how they managed it. They have a great salad dressing, but I don't think dressing can carry the meal. My boyfriend's home fries were the most anemic soggy looking potatoes I have ever seen and I felt sorry for them, they must have been embarrassed--no self respecting spud wants to be seen like that. They were rubbery and undercooked to boot.

Already feeling dejected by the general fail of taking guests here for brunch (we thought the Canadiana perfect for visitors from abroad and this was the only successful point) I went to pay. To do so, I had to interrupt the owner and the waitress from playing with a green lantern figure. While I was handed the debit doohickey, they continued to talk to each other, rather than me. I suppose one can't compete with a 6 inch posable super hero toy. It's good they enjoy themselves, but once again we felt less like we were guests in their home, than that they were at home and we were interrupting. 
Visually this place is a treasure. If they could extend the attention to detail and charm to the food, the music and the service, we would be frequent guests. But after a half dozen attempts I think we are done with waiting for them to find their groove."}
{"text":"Amazing food and the NICEST people I have ever encountered at a restaurant...will definitely go back despite not living near the restaurant at all. Really liked the breakfast burrito, sandwich, soup special, chocolate croissant...but so many other things looked good as well. Love that you can get breakfast food there during the week as well."}
{"text":"First time visiting this new restaurant. Right around the corner from our house, and MUCH needed in our 'hood.
Very unique take on Breaky & Lunch. We ordered the breakfast burrito and the \"Camp\" French Toast on special. Everything was sooo very good.  The burrito has house-made chili w fresh avocado, veggies, and comes with a side of sour cream and a wonderful homemade pickle chutney. They only do scrambled eggs, and since they don't have a grill, they \"steam\" their eggs using the espresso machine steamer. Very unique, very good and very healthy too!  The Camp french toast is also unique - basically they take 3 kinds of croissants (almond, chocolate, etc) and cut them up and re-bake them into a thick slice, served with fresh maple syrup & fruit. Out of this world! :)
The prices are AMAZING too. Meals were $7 & $8, and the fabulous Cafe Americano coffees were $2.75 ea.
That art-deco red Italian espresso machine is to-die for!
This is going to quickly become a favourite haunt!"}
{"text":"This place is very has a very homey and comforting feel. Small spot but decorated nicely. The food is good but it's a little overpriced which the service almost make up for. The employees are friendly and polite. This would be a great place for Sunday brunch or even Tuesday night date night."}
{"text":"A refreshing change from the same old same old boring brunch options of bloor west. With welcoming and friendly staff, the place has successfully created a warm atmosphere where you feel like you are sitting in a country/cottage kitchen.

The menu has a fresh bright feel with plenty of healthy choices. My gluttonous carnivorous brunch buddy was more than happy with the veggie chili which was full of flavour and had just the right amount of spice. I had turkey links which were a daily special, they were pretty tasty. We both had perfectly steamed scrambled eggs on the side.

We were pleasantly surprised to find that Camp was licenced and took advantage with a Caesar. They were so good we had to order another. The freshly grated horseradish added a kick and freshness that made this much better than your average Caesar, they took a while to come but only because the server was putting some extra love and care into it! A big juicy caper was the perfect garnish!

The portion sizes are decent but not massive. We liked that there was very little grease on the menu which includes breakfast burritos, smoked salmon bagels and various salads which you can add smoked trout to, this was a nice and different option instead of your usual chicken or shrimp. It is also remarkable how the chef works in such a tiny space behind the bar/counter.

They had fun music playing. The servers were bopping around the place to the cure and depeche mode. It is fantastic to see places like this open on Jane. Brunch is served until 4pm, they change over to an evening menu at 5pm and are open until 10pm. Oyster night is Friday night, we hope to visit soon to find out if Camp's charm can carry through to the evening!"}
{"text":"I joined a book 'n' brunch event here at the weekend and it was a pleasant surprise. It's a small place, bright and functional with lovely food. I had the breakfast burrito, which was great especially with a splash of red and green tabasco sauce. It didn't look much from a size perspective, but it was good, fresh and very filling. It's a lovely. relaxed place with great food for a great price."}
{"text":"As stated elsewhere, this is a great addition to the neighbourhood.  Had the breakfast special and was quite happy.  The decor and service are great.  I was really curious about the paninis and will have to go back and try them soon.  I was a little surprised that they didn't offer regular coffee, although the americano was really good."}
{"text":"Trudged here in a snowstorm and it was worth the walk. It's nice to have a great brunch spot hidden away in the neighbourhood.

Staff is friendly, the decor is cute and kitschy, and the food is fantastic. Looking forward to going back and buying myself some chutney to take home."}
{"text":"My favorite part about camp is that in any weather I can run from my front door to theirs without getting cold or wet. It took me forever to get over (that's generous) to Camp, which is tragic considering it's so close. Now I've been for three meals: two brunches and a lunch.

The menu is simple and it's the same for breakfast and lunch. I'm a fan of the steamed eggs, and the coffee is quite good. Service is excellent and friendly. Everyone is cheerful. Even the walls are full of good cheer. 

The menu is deceptive. It seems like there isn't much on it, until you start to combine things and count the specials. It's really quite full after a think. Breakfast options, thus far,have all been really good and filling! But, I will the portions for the lunch were greater... like with a side of some variety. The sandwiches are really good, but for the price, there could be some more on the plate to really turn it into a full meal. It's strange that it works out that way. 

Haven't been for breakfast yet, but it's imminent!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Camp!!  The smoked salmon salad is SO good, it's become my new #1 craving.  Everything is so fresh and flavourful - and the staff is as amazing as the cappuccino.  I was so happy to see that they open for dinner now!"}
{"text":"Great brunch, nice atmosphere, friendly service, good prices.

Food came piping hot and tasty. 

Will be back for sure. Only cons were a bit of slow service, and the place felt a bit cramped."}
{"text":"We're visiting the area and opted to meet friends here for Sunday brunch and I am so glad we did.  Everything was fantastic....the service....the preparation.....the presentation....and our dishes were oh so yummy!"}
{"text":"Well isn't this a cafe from my whimsical dreams! Campy canadiana dot the walls and muskoka-like touches are found everywhere. The menu is pretty considerable considering they don't have a kitchen - sandwiches are simple, fresh and panini pressed. The eggs with my breakfast special were a bit weird, like when I was a kid and used to make them in the microwave - just a bit off in texture but the sausage accompanying it was fantastic. 

Camp is totally kid and baby friendly. There is a few stairs to get into the restaurant but it's not impossible with a stroller. They have a high chair available, as well."}
{"text":"This place is cute and right across the street from me! I love the idea of a Canadiana themed restaurant that's not too cheesy. My boyfriend and I sat at the bench that faces the window. Unfortunately the place is a bit cramped, and this looked like the only nice spot. It was a nice place to sit though - a view and lots of lovely plants in front of us. The service was very friendly, although a bit slow. Food was good - we had a burrito and a grilled cheese with onions, both delicious. I had the crumble for dessert and it was great! Large and hot and tasty :) But I have to say for what they serve (simple, camp-themed food), the place was a bit pricey, and for that reason we'll only be visiting on an infrequent basis. This is really a 3.5 star review - I would give it 4 except for the price and cramped layout."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with some friends - perfect Canadian fare all around!  I had the grilled cheese sandwich (perfect size) and some banana bread, and everyone else had the BLAT sandwich and the scalloped potatoes with Italian sausage.  Those of us who had sandwiches were pleased, but the scalloped potatoes were a bit more thin and less cheesy than anticipated.  

The thing that really made it for us here were the cute decor all around, and the super friendly (and amusing) staff.  Would come here again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Camp Restaurant is A-OK.  Nice Ambiance and absolutely a wonderful addition to the growing neighbourhood of businesses along Jane Street.  Visited for the first time today, for lunch.  The waiter was attentive and helpful in finding items on the menu that did not include meat.  The Leek and Lentil soup was fantastic. You drink water out of a mason jar which I have mixed feelings about but my environmental feelings win out that it's a good idea.   Other than the waiter no one spoke to me. I sat at the bar stools but the girl working right opposite me did not say a word.  She was busy of course.  Still she had time to chat with the waiter about where he lived and how he liked living there.  She had time to complain about someone.  You hear everything in this restaurant.  There is little to absorb the sound so it has a noisy feel to it.  On the other hand you can listen to the various conversations and Dr. Seuss books being read (that Camp provides, nicely).  I ordered a sandwich with the side soup portion.  The sandwich came without the soup and then the soup followed when I asked for it.  I was told \"oh I just noticed that\" but a sorry would have been nice too.  The menu said that the sandwich came with fresh greens.  I was thinking that the fresh greens would be on the plate but no such luck.  Instead I received a single grape tomato cut in half, one olive, 2 prunes and a green striped thing which was small on a stem and unknown to me.  When I asked about the fresh greens I was told that the fresh greens were on the sandwich but alas that meant the few pieces of wilted lettuce amounted to the greens.  It was disappointing.  I will go back and I will try something else.  I see they have a veggie chili but it may be the only item on the menu which is non-meat and non-dairy.  Most \"vegetarian\" items have cheese and/or eggs. However the waiter did mention I could make a special request so they are flexible.  It's great to see they have their liquor license and it's really wonderful to have them in the neighbourhood.  Worth a try for sure and for me it is worth another visit. Still there's something about hearing the owner tell the staff in front of me that another person could not have anything more for the special that I think would have been best said outside of earshot of the clientele.  It's a bit tricky because of the size but for a moment's respite from work it's nice to hear nice things."}
