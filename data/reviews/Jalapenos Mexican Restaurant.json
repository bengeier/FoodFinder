{"text":"Really enjoyed Jalapenos. All of the staff were super friendly and the food was really good. They also had good food and drink specials."}
{"text":"I finally found a Mexican restaurant worth returning to. Nice inside and plenty of menu options. Do yourself a favor and order a Mangonada!"}
{"text":"First time visiting. Food was all very good. The fresh guacamole was amazing. Love the atmosphere. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Jalapenos just opened in our neighborhood and I'm sure it's about to become THE local Mexican spot.   The chips were thin and salsa had the perfect amount of spice. Our chips were quickly refilled and pipping hot when we began to run low - salsa as well.  My husband and I both ordered the chicken fajitas - he had steak added. The chicken was perfectly cooked - red/green/yellow peppers, onion and tomato soft but still just a bit of crunch. Overall an EXCELLENT meal, well priced (fajitas $12.25) and well portioned.   We came in late around 8:45 but the staff was still all smiles and very friendly. The menu has a wide variety of options - everyone can find something to their liking! I took a peek at the drink menu and will be definitely be ordering a 'sunburn' margarita next time!"}
{"text":"Really great food! The staff was also super nice. I had a margarita and one of the special fajitas (I forget the name..Jalapenos Fajita maybe). Literally everything about this place was awesome except the price....it cost about $50 with tip just for me. That's pretty high for this kind of place. If the prices were a little more reasonable I would frequent this place but as it stands it will be a once in a while adventure."}
{"text":"This place was awesome family friendly environment but overall the food was great!  Ive tried two different things from the large menu they have . I gotta say the Service was on point ! Shout out to Veronica our waiter did great job. The margaritas was good and very strong just like I em ! :) I had the garlic shrimp and requested lil extra kick.  But this was no kick, This was a Lu kang mortal kombat bicycle kick, This ish was spicy as hell and had my nose runny but couldn't stop eating ! The salsa they provide for the chips is the best I've had in charlotte so far and also has nice lil kick to it. The TEXAS DIP IS MUST TRY !!"}
{"text":"Wow... we have been looking for a fun place that has outstanding Mexican food. They also have great margaritas and the service is outstanding.. This one of our favorite new place."}
{"text":"Ok...  this is a three visit summary.  The food is good, actually quite good.  I left a five star review for the sister property by the same ownership group.  However, they miss the mark here.  The first two visits had ok service and good food.  Last visit was WAY off the mark.  They are extremely over priced on the Michelada, so I ordered a beer instead, it was so warm that I thought maybe it had just come off the beer truck.  I switched to a water.  I tried to order tacos de asada, and Jessi told me they did not have that.  I pointed out the fact that I had eaten them there before, then she pointed that it was on the lunch menu.  WOW... really, I am wanting to give you money, any dollar amount did not really care about price, and I cannot get what I want???  I ordered two super tacos instead.  After a thirty (30) minute ticket time for two tacos and a quesadilla, the taco shells literally fell apart due to being made so far ahead and the grease soaking the shells as they sat under a heat strip.  A greasy floor, slow cook times, warm beer, and lackluster service did not make for a pleasurable experience.  They are on the edge of being a great place, but there is some serious fine tuning that needs to be done.  This was on a not busy weeknight, and creates real concern about what a weekend would hold in store."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great. Salsa is got a hint of heat on it with a great flavor. We both had frozen lime house margaritas which packed a punch! I ordered the steak and chorizo which had great flavor (I'm a chorizo snob and it was good) and my wife ordered the Texas Rice which was great as well. Everything was reasonably priced with good portions. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food deserves 5 stars.  It is fantastic!  The service deserves 1 star.  I have visited Jalapenos in Indian Land twice in the last week.  Both times I ordered the shredded beef chimichanga. The menu says it comes with tomato, lettuce, sour cream and guacamole.  Both times I asked for no tomato or lettuce, and both times it came without sour cream also.  On the first visit, the server argued with me saying it doesn't come with sour cream? Seriously?  You are going to sit there and argue with a customer and not even bother to just look at the menu and give me some freaking sour cream???  On the second visit, the server did not come back to our table (or even make an appearance in the dining room at all) for 10-15 minutes after we received our food.  I finally flagged him down and asked for sour cream.  At this point my husband was already finished with his meal, and both of our drinks had been empty for a while. Other than taking our order, bringing us our bill, and when I flagged him down across the restaurant for sour cream, our server never came to our table.  Not to mention that we finished off a whole order of chips and salsa before he even came to our table for the first time to take our drink order. And this was a Wednesday evening when the restaurant was only half way full.  When we got out bill there was a $1.25 charge for the sour cream.  So I got charged for something that the menu said came with the entr√©e.  At this point I'm completely torn.  The food is so amazing, but I don't think it is worth the poor service at this point.  Servers arguing with me, getting charged for something that should have been free, drinks not being refilled, and servers disappearing in the back for the majority of the visit...."}
{"text":"Texas Rice is ridiculously good and huge portion. Definitely will be back to try more.  The complimentary chips and salsa are a nice touch and are very tasty as well."}
{"text":"We went for the first time tonight. Some good and some just ok..  the Guacamole (table side) is really good, but pricey. $7.50 for a small that has 1 guacamole. But like I said, was good. The queso is also good. We had the Texans burrito and chicken fajita. Kids for tacos and chicken nuggets. The kids meal looked like a frozen dinner. Round nuggets and fries.  The food tasted fine but the main issue is the chicken and steak are cut into very small and thin pieces. Makes you wonder if they are very low grade cuts of meat. Most places have \"strips\" for fajitas but these are very small cuts. For example, On the Border we can split the fajitas.  But not here. My wife ate all of the chicken easily. So the smaller pieces looks like a lot but really isn't. The shrimp is good size and also cooked very well.  We will go back again, but had very high hopes when we went.  It wasn't the great Mexican we hoped for, but will do from time to time."}
{"text":"Probably the best Mexican food we have had since we moved here from Texas.  We have been impressed with everything we have had there so far, with the exception of the tamales.  We will be back!"}
