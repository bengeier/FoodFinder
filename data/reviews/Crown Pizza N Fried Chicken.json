{"text":"I really wanted to love this place as it is only about a 10 mins walk away from me, but I was left dissapointed. I ordered the large 3 topping special and took it home to share with the family. Upon opening the box, the first thing I realized was how much they skimped on the cheese and sauce!!! It looked like dough with a couple veggie toppings. Hardly any cheese or sauce! 

Very dissapointed, but I am hoping they turn things around soon. Will give them another try sometime in the near future."}
{"text":"Our family has ordered, pizza, wings, and fried chicken a few times now and have enjoyed the food every time.

They now have a website (albeit not a great one) that allows for online ordering which is great to see."}
{"text":"So, we ordered online. An hour ago. We decided to call to see where our order was- Staff answered from the shop said that their website is not set up and operational. Ya. That would be good to know. Not a great impression so far...made an order, again, not terrible pizza but not great either. Wouldn't recommend, there are better places in Whitby with better tasting product and much better service."}
