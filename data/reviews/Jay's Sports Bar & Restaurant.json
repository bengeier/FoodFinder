{"text":"YES! This place is just my style. Hockey / Ice Rink, lot's of TV's to watch the game, pool tables, juke box, video games, and great friendly service!
Decent prices, one night had a mini pizza and side salad- very tasty!
Lot's of choices on the menu from pizza and wings, to burgers and pasta.
Close to both the Hilton Garden inn and the Hilton Homewood suites, also close to my work's PA office- a great stop for happy hour! 
When I go back to PA I will deffy be going here!
and ladies... it's a total sausage fest! Giddy up! ;-)"}
{"text":"We went here last Friday night to watch my husband's brother play hockey.  First, having been dating/married to my husband for 7 years now, I have been to a ton (ton ton ton) of his brother's hockey games.  While I like watch hockey, sitting on the bleachers is 1. cold 2. boring (I sorta have an AD/HD thing going when watching sports) 3. smelly (sometimes).  To be able to watch the game (and clearly) from a table while chowing down on wings and fries and yummy bar food made my night. 

I haven't even started in on the food, and already table placement gets 2 thumbs up.  

Anyhow, the food.  I got wings (buffalo ranch) and loaded fries.  Perhaps it was because I was eating at 7:30, a good 2 hours past my normal dinner time and I was STARVING...but the food was really really good.  Nothing better than fries slathered in cheese and bacon then dipped in ranch dressing.  And the wings were really really good.  I'd put them on my favorite wings in the 'burgh list (which I will promptly do after finishing this review).  They were saucy, and perfectly done.  Yum. 

I probably wouldn't go back unless we had another hockey game to watch, as it took 45 minutes to get there, but for those in the area - definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Visited Jays Sports Bar and Restaurant for dinner.  It was first time ever eating there.  There were 4 adults 1 child. Alot of great tasting food for your buck.  The staff was pleasant, and seemed to be enjoying thereselves.  My drink never went empty, the waitress had a new on there before the old was at a 1/4 glass.  Then with in 1 min of me finishing the empty glass was gone.  Waitress was great ( mind you she had alot of tables to tend to as well)   Now for the food  We ordered 2 appitizers.  When the waitress brought them, they were like a full blown meal.  They were full of flavor and tasted great.  Main course was delicious we could barely finish.  Again very large portion.  So I would reccommend this place to anyone and everyone.  Great food Great Staff Great Experience. Great Fun.

Keep up the good work Jays Sports Bar and Restaurant."}
