{"text":"Very tasty shawarma wrap! Add hot sauce if you can handle a little spicy, it will make the shawarma even better!"}
{"text":"Shawarma Q has to be my favorite takeout place in the area, the service is always fast, efficient and the food is great quality. My go tos are the falafel (which I especially love because it is so spicy/also easily made vegan) and the lentil soup. The lentil soup is a must try, and you can't beat the price! I'm a vegetarian so I haven't had their meat dishes, however my partner swears by the chicken shawarma! At lunch there is usually a lineup, but it moves quite quickly so don't let that deter you!"}
{"text":"Truly an amazing experience. The beef Shawarma sandwich was delicious! The portion was a little small. The hot sauce had a very nice kick to it. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! The garlic mayo is amazing. I come with my husband everyday for lunch"}
{"text":"Secretly, this is the best shawarma in Toronto.  Spicy, meaty, and they even have the turnip.  Shawarma wrap, a pop and a lentil soup for $11.  I could eat this everyday."}
