{"text":"I spend many of my days at 7th. St. Market. It's definitely one of my favorite spots in Charlotte. So, it's unfortunate how consistently terrible Local Loaf is. Adam and his staff are always unfriendly and inattentive. This morning I decided to give them another go after many bad experiences with cold \"biscuits\" that look like dinner rolls and long waits and again they served a cold biscuit after a 10 minute wait and others being served ahead of me. I think they have potential but they do not care about their customers. For all my bad experiences I have never been apologized to or asked if I wanted my money back. I have given them so many chances and today is the last straw. 

Don't go here. Bring your own breakfast to the market during the week or eat Cookie Cult cookies from NJC."}
{"text":"* GROUPON BUYERS PLEASE BE AWARE*

Recently I purchased a deal from Groupon. The deal is good for 6 take out box lunches at this place. However, I was not able to use the Groupon during my visit. The cashier told me that I can only redeem all at once, meaning that I have to get six sandwiches during one visit. I explained that this restriction was not specified on the Groupon deal page, and I asked if they could offer me a voucher for 6 visits instead. Unfortunately, they declined it and told me to either use it or lose it.

So apparently my first experience with them was quite upset. Before I purchased the deal, I tried calling them three times to specify the restrictions, however, no one answered the phone during their business hours that day (Saturday 3pm). So I just went ahead and purchased the Groupon.

I agree that it's possible that a misunderstanding could occur during a business. Nevertheless, when both parties realize that it's a misunderstanding due to some unclear clause provisions during the initial communication; at that point, if the seller decides not to honor it or issue a proper refund, then it becomes a scam. Unfortunately, this happened to me today. So I wanted to bring awareness to other potential buyers to this dishonest behavior.

{"text":"Completely disappointed with this establishment as a retail bakery.  After 5+ trips and having no baguettes sold retail, stick to wholesale then and don't tease us with loaves on display that you won't sell. Plus calling your baguettes as \"baguettes\" is an atrocity. Might as well call 'em bread sticks. If I enter the 7th street public market again, I'll add a picture."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service but the food was a bit of a let down. I ordered the BLT, which features a fried green tomatoes, popcorn shoots in lieu of lettuce and applewood smoked bacon. Conceptually it sounded great but the execution failed. The bacon was clearly not freshly cooked and the tomato was mushy and flavorless. Overall, the sandwich was just a mess."}
{"text":"My husband got the Cuban with chips and I got the black bean falafel burger with the cucumber & onion salad. The salad was fresh and the sandwich was the perfect amount. The ingredients on the sandwich are thoughtfully put together and it didn't leave me overly stuffed. It was nice to go to a place that doesn't slop on a bunch of ingredients to make it \"big.\" Loved it and would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"It's a Friday lunch time, and the waiting lane was only two or three people. But I waited 30 minutes after placing a order of salad. Is that hard to prepare a salad? It looks like they completely forgot my order. I was hungry, but now I have no mood to eat anymore because this long waiting period. Lunch time is ruined. I asked them to refund the money, and they did. Bad experience."}
{"text":"The Bottom Line:
- Point to something on the menu.
- Order it (you can't go wrong)
- Enjoy the old standards with a very special twist.
- Repeat....

I am just so impressed with all of that I have had from the Local Loaf. There are little touches of detail and skill that elevate every dish. So, so decadently good!"}
{"text":"So good! Had the croque madame, a specialty omelet, and a donut. All were delicious and the croque madame was very unique. I wish they could open another one where I live! In addition the market where it is located is great with unique shops, coffee, and other food options."}
{"text":"With the unique options of food, I would assume service would be better. I ordered a Steak and Egg Breakfast Sandwich with a Cucumber Salad. It was was a busy Sunday so waiting was to be expected. Once I received my meal and took a bite, the steak was extremely greasy and the eggs were a little bit well done. I went back to the count to explain the experience I had and to see if I could trade my meal out. The hostess explain that the food was fine and that how it was cooked and just ask if I wanted a to go box. On top of that, the owner/exec chef was standing within ear shot of the conversation and not once stepped in."}
{"text":"I bought the steak and egg sandwich, it was alright. The steak was marinated and was good, but the egg was too over salted for my taste. Took me standing there for 3 minutes waiting to get someone's attention. I asked for take out, and they got that wrong as well. Alright food, but wouldn't come back without a groupon."}
{"text":"YUM. Delicious food. We tried the chicken & egg sandwich and the steak & egg sandwich, both of which were very tasty - although the amazing bread kind of overshadowed the fillings. I would not, however, recommend the grits as they were kind of bland and lumpy. The homemade potato chips were much better. We came for brunch on a Saturday and it took about 10-15 minutes to get our food. I'll be back if I find myself in Charlotte again!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Uptown for the morning and wandered into 7th Street Public Market. We instantly liked the vibrant atmosphere where locals and tourists mingle together looking for a delicious bite to eat. Local Loaf's unique menu caught my eye. I ordered the duck and waffles! The scrumptiously warm and soft Belgian-style waffles were perfectly paired with the yummy Jack Daniels maple syrup. I really enjoyed the perfectly fried Southern duck confit with the soft cotija cheese. My sister and brother-in-law enjoyed the flavorful Monte Cristo with the fried cinnamon ice cream. All the flavors simply burst in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Great food. Loved the pancakes and my husband had a great sandwich with the house chips.  Probably going to go back again tomorrow."}
{"text":"The bread is a fantastic start. Then add fancy chicken or meat. Fun garnishes.  Good sides. Wowzer. I like the cucumber salad. A nice tartness. The home made chips are bland...but way over compensated for by the general awesomeness of this place. Can you deliver? How about a standing order for a biscuit in the morning???"}
{"text":"I wasted 32 minutes waiting for an over priced sandwich! The cashier was very helpful but the manager's comment of \"Your ticket says you've been 19 not 20 minutes ticked me off\", It's a sandwich not a cooked dish. I saw at least 25 to 30 other orders delivered before mine. As compensation for my long wait time, a muffin does not make it worthwhile to ever eat there again!"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast--delicious omelet and sour dough toast. Then got a coconut macaroon for my flight home. The thing was delicious--really really good--and also huge! I ate it in three parts and it lasted all day. Much better than a more expensive coconut macaroon I got from a local French bakery downtown."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I like to get the Local Dip sandwich with a cup of soup. The sandwich is amazing! The meat is tender and full of flavor and the bread is freshly baked. The soup is different each time I've been, but I've always liked what was served. I do have to say one thing about their soups - no matter what kind it is, you can bet it will be spicy! I'm not weak when it comes to my spice tolerance, but 2 out of the 4 soups I've tried have caused me to tear up. The other two just caused me to need an extra napkin for my nose. The soups are definitely spicy, but I still eat every bite."}
{"text":"My bf and I ordered the chocolate croissant, spinach and feta croissant, and blueberry pancakes to share. It all came on wooden boards lined with checkered paper, which I thought was awesome because I'm a sucker for little details like this. 

The croissants just were okay. Really greasy and not flakey like it should be--to say the least, I've had better. The pancakes had a nice crunch on the outside and were soft and fluffy on the inside, but they were just so sweet. I didn't even need to put syrup on them. They weren't bad, but I just couldn't get over how almost sickly sweet they were."}
{"text":"I'm dumbfounded reading these other reviews because my food was awful. I ordered the chicken and the egg. The chicken tenders were the quality of any chain restaurant-overbreaded and stringy. The BBQ sauce was way to sweet-I could barely detect any flavor over the sweetness. The biscuit was pretty good considering. I also tried the croque monsieur. The ham was so incredibly sweet it was gross. The \"bread\" was like a sweet burned pancake. 

And for the grand finale......the chips were burned. On both orders. They were the color of a chocolate bar. I think with chain restaurants they put a lot of sugar in everything because that is the perceived american palette..but this place is not a chain, so I expected good food and I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"We ate here on Sunday morning around 10 am. The hubster and I each got a Palli  (vegetarian) sandwich: cooked spinach, sweet grilled red bell peppers, olive oil, and a thick slice of melty mozzarella on freshly made focaccia. We got a side of house-made chips. After paying and receiving our table marker, we went over to Not Just Coffee for their \"to die for\" lattes w/almond milk. The sandwiches were brought to us about four minutes after we started sipping our lattes.

Everything was delicious! The sandwiches were simple, tasty, and though vegetarian were quite hearty. The bread was fresh; soft and flavorful in the middle with a perfect crisp crust. We both enjoyed the chips too. Yes, there were a couple that were dark and bitter but the majority were a delicious compliment to our sandwiches: very lightly salted so you can actually taste potato. I think the sandwich could be even better with a couple thick slices of grilled portobello mushrooms brushed with a little BBQ sauce.

A perfect dessert afterwards was chocolates from barChocolate...(^.^)"}
{"text":"I love this place! I make a stop to the 7th street public market at least once a week and local loaf is my go to spot! The food is amazing and staff is great. They've recently been carrying more pastries and there homemade croissants are to die for! The sandwiches are all so delicious and so unique! The turkey in the rye is my favorite right now, or the hot steak! I just can't chose!! The sandwiches are so well crafted with tons of amazing favors. No offense, but these masterpieces are not for the simple pallet. Try everything that comes on them! They were made that way for a reason, trust me!"}
{"text":"February/2015- Saturday lunch and I am thrilled I chose this place. Yummy \"hot steak\" sand which and loved the seafood chowder on this cold day. My girls shared the chicken tenders. Super tasty for the normally typical kids menu item. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Enjoy their french toast and chicken and egg sandwich. Never had a bad meal from here."}
{"text":"It was my first and last time eating there. Last Saturday my family and I want to try this place so we did. After we got our food and start to eat I notice the bread was dry for my Cuban sandwich and it was very salty. I went back to the vender and tell them that the sandwich is too salty I couldn't eat it can I get something else. They said sure. So I order another sandwich and the short Hispanic lady want to charge me for the sandwich again. After that I want to talk to the manager and the manager act like an idiot and act like he don't know what I was talking about and still want to charge me. This place is mess up. I won't go back to this place again."}
{"text":"I normally don't write scathing reviews but this place deserves it. When the owner (Adam) tells a customer that he doesn't care if he ever comes back, he doesn't know the meaning of customer service. Especially when his kitchen messed up my order not one, not two, but three times. Actually, I never received half my order.  After receiving half my order, my girlfriend never received her order (after over an hour waiting). 

To tell you the truth, the food is above average. But decent food without good service is not a place I want to patronage. The service was beyond horrible!!  Even though the servers were apologetic each time I spoke with them about my order, it was never fixed.  And then to top it off the owner gives me attitude!?! The correct response to a customer should be, \"I apologize for the mix up, how can I fix it?\"  Instead, I got attitude with a response that \"you're probably not going to come back and I don't care\". Maybe he was just having a bad day. Either way, I DON'T CARE!!!!  I'm a customer who had paid for a meal, and didn't receive what I paid for."}
{"text":"My husband's croissant sandwich was amazing! Buttery, flaky and rich in flavor! I ordered an egg white omelette with some veggies which, in most other places would have been bland, but this one was seasoned so well and cooked just right that it was the perfect combination of healthy and tasty."}
{"text":"This is a review of the service and food service practices of the restaurant, not the food itself. 

I came here for the first time today and ordered a veggie burger and cucumber salad. I was given a number (32) and took a seat at a table. After waiting 30 minutes for my food I got up and asked about it. I was told they were preparing it at that time. When I asked if it usually takes 30 minutes they said that they were in the process of cleaning up to close so it was probably just taking that long because they were multitasking. 

They then brought the burger out and showed me a receipt to prove to me that I had not been waiting 30 minutes. However, the number on the receipt (38) was not my number (32) so I told them that is what I ordered but they should check to make sure they weren't giving me someone else's because that was not my number.

A few minutes later they walked over to another table where they had set a plate of food down at least 15 mins prior. They took that back behind the counter and then took it to the person who had the number on the receipt they showed me.

I had watched them set the food down initially and took the number (34) that was sitting on the empty table. Nobody was at the table but they left it there anyway. I kept looking over and nobody ever came for that food. This being my first time I didn't know that what they sat down was a veggie burger. It seems like they made an error in the numbers and left my food at an empty table. Then when I asked about mine they gave me someone else's order. Then gave that person the burger that had been sitting out unattended for at least 15 minutes! 

I will not be returning here after seeing them serve someone food like that!!


Update: As I spent my whole 30 mins waiting facing the register I know there were no more than 5-10 customers during my time waiting. At no point was there ever a line. Even if this small number is what you consider \"high volume\" for your establishment, that does not justify serving a customer food that has been unattended sitting out in the public area where anyone could have tampered with it for over 15 minutes. My review was not of the 30 minute wait, but of the unsanitary practices of your establishment that you chose not to acknowledge in your response."}
{"text":"Great customer service I felt very cared for. Their recommendations were good. Their burger is a must try as are their fries which are crunchy goodness. Their presentation is all done on cutting boards which is a nice touch. The salmon burger was just ok. The she crab soup was boring."}
{"text":"Asked for bacon well done. It was barely cooked. Eggs looked beyond disgusting. Service was not very friendly."}
{"text":"Local Loaf recently opened at the 7th Street Public Market's in Uptown Charlotte, NC and we are already hooked.

Adam Spears is the creative mind behind Local Loaf and the vision is to provide the finest freshly baked artisan breads, world class ciabattas, handed rolled baguettes, and a variety of fresh baked loaves. We haven't come across anything like this in the Queen City yet and we were in love at the first bite.

The Local Dip comes served on a hand rolled baquette with red wine braised sirloin, provolone cheese, caramelized onions, and au jus. The best part of this sandwich was easily the baguette. As a baker I (ella) really admire people who will take the time to hand craft the bread they serve. The baguette was light and airy, had great flavor and didn't cut the roof of my mouth when I ate it. The sirloin was dripping with flavor that paired perfectly with the provolone and carmel onions, and the au jus was the perfect dip.

I (curtis) opted for the hot steak sandwich which is served on a crusty baquette with marinated skirt steak, red onion jam, melted aged white cheddar, cress mirco greens, and topped off with a horseradish garlic aioli. I hate horseradish... but the horseradish garlic aioli was what I would consider \"finger lickin' good\" and the skirt steak was as juicy as it was fresh. This was the best steak sandwich I've had in... well... maybe ever?

We loved Local Loaf so much on our first trip we decided to head back a few days later to check out the breakfast menu. Ella got the chicken & egg biscuit with a generous piece of fried chicken breast topped with a Cheerwine chipotle honey glaze, aged white cheddar, a soft poached egg, and mustard greens.

This is by far the best tasting and most creative breakfast sandwich I (ella) have ever come across. The chicken was super juicy with the perfect amount of fried crunchy exterior and the poached egg added a nice sauce to soak up into the light fluffy biscuit. The part that really stood out was the spicy, sweet, and very delicious Cheerwine chipotle honey glaze. One bite of the chicken and egg biscuit made be an instant fan.

The steak & egg baguette came with marinated steak served with soft scrambled egg, honey roasted garlic and smoked jalapeno aioli, arugula served on a rustic hand-rolled baguette. I (curtis) absolutely loved the sandwich but didn't like the focaccia it was served on. Normally its served on a \"rustic hand-rolled baquette\" but they weren't ready when we were there so mine came on focaccia instead. Ella makes an amazing focaccia that I have become slightly accustomed too so maybe I'm a little biased but whatever.

Local Loaf just opened in the 7th St Public Market and if you haven't been by there lately you really need too. Chef Adam has an amazing concept on his hands and we're in love with Local Loaf."}
{"text":"Got I the chicken and egg breakfast sandwich and it is out of this world! A must try in the 7th street market"}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place! Love purely cause the food is amazing and hate because they take all my money!

Local Loaf is located within 7th Street Market. Typically, I am walking here from my office but if you park in the 7th Street deck, you can validate your ticket for 90 minutes (validation machine is at the Bonsai Sushi place).

I have eaten both breakfast and lunch here. For breakfast, I typically stick to the breakfast burrito because it is just amazing. Chorizo, egg, peppers, sweet potato, cheese.....mix made in heaven! I have heard that the steak and egg and chicken and egg are both real good as well. For lunch, I have had the broccoli burger and the french dip (that was on special one day). The broccoli burger is absolutely fantastic. I mean, you don't even notice that the patty is made of veggies! It has a sriracha ketchup on it that is perfection. It is actually my go to on the menu! For sides, you get to choose from pickles cucumbers, house made chips, or a cup of soup. Typically I go for the chips or their soup of the day. The soups are always fantastic! The house made chips are some of the best tasting chips I have ever had. 

Run, don't walk, to this place. Order anything on the menu cause you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot for uptown workers. I have had several of their meals and have enjoyed all of them. My favorite is the chicken & the egg. The hot steak sandwich is great, and my next meal will be the porchetta sandwich. I do wish they would serve (or offer) a sauce with the house chips, though."}
{"text":"Their hot steak sandwich was pretty good. I enjoyed my first couple of bites of the cucumber and onion salad, but the vinegar was a little too potent for me. I would go with the chips next time. My kids seemed to enjoy their grilled cheese, so that's always a plus. A few dollars more than I would like to spend on lunch, but it's conveniently located next to Imaginon, so I will probably be coming again."}
{"text":"Did not live up to expectations. Food was sub par when it is busy. Come back when it is slower."}
{"text":"Needed to kill time this morning while my hotel was prepping my room so I yelped and found Local Loaf for breakfast. They had an offer for 15% off too! The service was great and my entree was prepared quickly. I had the biscuit and gravy with a side of scrambled eggs. The biscuit was homemade and HUGE! They slice it and cover it with a homemade slightly spicy light brown gravy.... Not your typical white sawmill gravy. I liked it, though! The biscuit was just a little sweet so the savory gravy went well with it. My eggs were cooked perfectly, not too runny or overdone, and perfectly seasoned with salt and pepper (no need to add more). The gravy also went well with the eggs. I would visit again!"}
{"text":"This is my very first review. The manager was very personable and honored the coupon even after the time stated.  I had a longer wait than normal but he said he made them remake my pancakes. Because I don't like eggs or cheese the pancakes and grits were not my favorite but I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The turkey burgers are to die for. They literally just fall apart in your mouth which i like. They also have a few selections of breakfast items. The potato chips are homemade which are really good!"}
{"text":"Too expensive for the quality of the food in my opinion. Lots of tastier food spots and vendors in uptown, not to mention with atmospheres that are more welcoming!"}
{"text":"The croissantwich was amazing! The homemade chips looked on point but I went with the cucumber salad to try and keep it lighter (hah!) The cucumbers were a great side. Thoroughly impressed with the quality and presentation overall. Very reasonable pricing. We are just in town for the weekend and wish I could take this place back with me. If I lived here I would be there every Saturday."}
{"text":"My friends and I all ordered the Chicken and the Egg based on Yelp reviews and it was really good, and beautifully presented.  Perfectly spiced fried chicken on a biscuit with a great sweet syrupy sauce - I was full before I even got to the biscuit on the bottom!  It comes with either homemade potato chips or cucumber salad which tasted like bread and butter pickles - both were good so if you're with a friend order one of each and share, since they give you a ton of food!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I wasn't quite pleased with my food here at Local Loaf. I had the Chicken and Egg biscuit. It was a mess. The poached egg (perfectly poached) was on the bottom side of the biscuit and I don't know if it was cut unevenly or what, but it seemed like part of the biscuit was missing. The chicken...way over seasoned! I don't like bland food, but I'd rather be able to add to it if need be. The seasoning on the chicken combined with the chipotle glaze was just too heavy on the salt scale for me. One of the chefs told me the chicken tenders are hand breaded...I can appreciate that, but it was all bread. Hardly any chicken under all the breading. Hate to say this but, I've had more substantial chicken tenders at Bojangles. That really made me sad. I had to eat it with a knife and fork and I was searching for the chicken and some aged cheddar flavor. The biscuit...no. No buttery flavor and not very flakey. It was almost dry. Not a \"southern\" biscuit by any means. My breakfast biscuit came with chips and they had some soggy almost wet spots on them. I'm guessing it was grease or something (I hope). Not quite sure. I think Local Loaf needs to go back to the drawing board on this one, or maybe I caught them at a bad time. I will go back to try a fresh loaf of bread. I kind of wish I could have my $8 (almost) $9 back for that biscuit. :("}
{"text":"This is a place my girlfriend and I love to walk to on the weekends for brunch. We love this location with all the vendors and the farmer's market like grocery in the back. We always get the chicken and biscuit with the sweet drizzle. The biscuit is large and dry usually so make sure you have your drink but don't let that scare you because the flavor of the drizzle, chicken, and egg give such a great flavor. They have soups of the day and if you see they have beer cheese broccoli, you better get it. It may be the best cheesy broccoli soup I have ever had. The only draw back to this place is they don't have drinks except for bottled or canned drinks which I wont pay for especially water, I dont let that stop me from coming."}
{"text":"Phenomenal bread and the BEST Italian sandwhich in town! Sides are also great. I want to try more on the menu but again that Italian is my weakness. Service is fantastic and they are always super nice!"}
{"text":"Just went out of our way to visit Local Loaf. Went to Polka Dot bakery first, and to LL for lunch.
We ordered a Reuben to split. What a disappointment!  $9 for what? A VERY small  (size of plain loaf bread) sandwich that had practically no meat. The little bit of corned beef was chopped, like it was for hash. There wasn't even the equivalent of  of 2 regular slices of meat. Sandy said it looked like what you get from a can.   There were gobs of the dressing which tasted like mustard, some cheese and a little kraut. The bread was ok, but I wouldn't pay $9 for 2 small slices of bread. Again, very disappointed! 

Probably won't be back! And, no, I don't work for the competition.

I will say, it was one of the only places with no line."}
{"text":"The guy working was so attentive and kind! (I wish I got his name..) He offered to help answer any questions we had about the market and the restaurant. Great service and such a memorable experience!

We ended up ordering from his restaurant and I got the veggie Broccolini burger with a side of pickled cucumber. My mom got the pancetta sandwich with the soup."}
{"text":"I stumbled into the 7th street market after my flight from DC super hungry. I ordered the chef veggie sandwich based off my craving for the honey chipotle hummus spread listed as part of the sandwich on the menu. I picked the cucumber salad as my side. What a winning combo!! Not only were the veggies and bread super fresh, but the hummus did not disappoint. The cucumber salad was a great combo of vinegar and dill, which I could have slurped up in its entirety if I wasn't in a public setting. So good!!! I'm glad Jerris (spelling?) took my order even though they looked like they were closing shop. Not only was the food delicious, but the customer service set the standard for southern hospitality. I want to come back and taste the ham & brie sandwich, which was my second choice off the menu. A++++"}
{"text":"Food is good, they are creative and are also risk takers.....sometimes it pays off really well but let's not walk out without a net"}
{"text":"Second time trying the Local Loaf, exactly one year later, and ordered the Chicken and the Egg again. It was a little disappointing this time unfortunately. I felt like the fried chicken wasn't as flavorful or big in size as the last time, and it lacked some of the sweetness we had previously. Biscuits are still pretty good though I would have preferred less salt. 

The biggest frustration was when I ordered an additional side of cucumber salad, but the servers were a bit careless when they prepared my order. I got a large side, though I saw a smaller container, and the server just explained that they ran out of lids for the larger and just gave me some extra on the side with the entree. Well the entree is already supposed to come with a small side, and I discovered that they didn't give me any additional cucumbers to make up for the rest. The server insisted that there was more in the other container w/ the entree, so I took her word for it. Unfortunately this is they type of thing that makes restaurant servers seem inexperienced. I could have gone back to complain but sometimes it's just more trouble than it's worth. They should have got it right the first time. Sigh!"}
{"text":"This is one of the only bakeries near uptown that offered a savory bread loaf, so I gave Local Loaf a try. Pecorino Rosemary sounded perfect, but it was a bit disappointing. This bread did not taste that great straight out of the bag. However, once I doctored it up, it was very nice. After brushing with roasted garlic olive oil, oven toasting and sprinkling with salt and pepper, it made a great base for bruschetta and artisan cheeses. However, I would not spend $6-$7 again for a loaf of bread that needs this much work. 

Based on other yelp reviews, I will be back at least one more time to try their lunch sandwiches."}
{"text":"Impressively delicious chicken & egg biscuit sandwich with savory chicken tenders in a cheer wine sauce & egg & homemade biscuit. I wasn't sure about the chipotle cheer wine sauce but the bf said he thought he'd had it before & it adds a hint of sweet to the sauce. He was correct because it gave the sandwich a sweet spicy finish. The side of homemade potato chips were the perfect tiny handful so I cannot wait to try another sandwich. Good service & fabulous breakfast sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Local Loaf keeps getting better and better.  The signature chicken and the egg with the sweet hot chipotle sauce is dreamy.  It will cure a hangover or a broken heart. 

Take some bread home to eat later, it is all wonderful.  The french dip, the burgers, the brunch, the lovely people that work there and the unique quality of the food is unprecedented in Charlotte. 

You wont experience this anywhere else.  Go! Then thank me afterwards :)"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here before a big NFL playoff game in January. Wifey got the breakfast burrito, which was pretty good. I ordered pancakes, which were inedible when I received them as they had been burnt to a crisp. I showed them to the cashier who apologized and took care of it right away, getting me new pancakes and two free coconut macaroons. The food was good, but not great but I really appreciated their resolving the issue of the burnt pancakes: they are thin crusted, so they finish them in the oven to crisp them up so they must have left the first ones in the oven too long. I don't know if I'd come back for breakfast but I'd definitely get their pastries again. The price is really good too, $20 for two big breakfasts."}
{"text":"When searching for some brunch food at 7th Street Market, I was passed by a fantastic looking open faced biscuit sandwich with fried chicken and a poached egg covered in a deliciously sticky looking sauce.  I just knew I had to try it... so I made my way to Local Loaf.

The Chicken and the Egg dish was a wonderful combination of crispy chicken tenders and a lovely poached egg, which were both quite delicious.  My only wish was that the biscuit underneath was warmed up and the cheerwine sauce was a little less sweet and more savory in flavor.

Despite it being prime brunch time on the weekend, Local Loaf was quick to delivering my dish!"}
{"text":"Steak, egg & cheese breakfast sandwich... delicious!  The bread was the perfect mix of hard outside and soft inside.  The steak was tender, hot and flavorful.  I wish we would have been able to go back the following day to try the chicken breakfast sandwich!  Everything looked amazing!  The staff was super friendly, and the food came out very quickly.  I will be going back next time I'm in charlotte!"}
{"text":"Food is so so but the management of this business is horrible!  Hard to believe a place can stay in business with someone running it who's so rude and insulting.  Not worth your money or your time."}
{"text":"Great service. Had their chicken and egg dish and it was GREAT! Chocolate chip pancake was good but nothing out of this world. Also tried their sugar donut. Very good stuff, highly recommend and will be going back. Also, if you get the donut go across the shop and buy a sample of Nutella, dip the donut and ."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a bit with family and friends. Delicious food and second to none service. I had the Tostada cobb salad....Flavor explosion!!! Everything tasted so fresh and the prices are reasonable. Stop by and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the sea bass Cesar salad for lunch and I love it! The portion is big and the fish tasted fresh. Other items on the menu looks good but I think I will get the same thing again when I come back. It's that good!"}
{"text":"Get dat chicken biscuit, yo.  I was still drunk from the night before, cams here, and it probably single handedly prevented me from spewing in public."}
{"text":"The BEST chicken and egg biscuit in Charlotte. 

Yep. I said it. 

This menu had so many yummy choices. But I decided to give this sandwich a try with a few modifications. I switched the biscuit for a baguette, asked for my egg to be fried hard and asked for the cheerwine sauce on the side. When it arrived to the table they got my order right and everything was nice and hot! 

But to be honest this sandwich is so good it deserves to be ordered with no modifications! Next time I'm ordering it just like they make it. 

The chicken is very well seasoned and so crispy. And the cheerwine sauce is heavenly. I need them to bottle that up and sell it! 

I can not wait to enjoy every. single. bite. again!!! 

Get yourself here for this sandwich! I can guarantee you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to 7th Street Market seeking a nice spot for brunch. There was a large variety of options on the Local Loaf menu so we decided to check it out. Ultimately, I was not a huge fan of the chicken + (poached) egg, although my friend loved it. I think this meal would have been much better if the egg was scrambled. The homemade chips were pretty good though."}
{"text":"Very good food and quality. Staff was friendly.  4 stars because I found them a little pricy. For $15 I thought I would've gotten more food than a 6in sub and a cup of soup. I understand the concept of quality over quantity but a 15 dollar sandwich I would expect to see in a restaurant, not a an order out place."}
{"text":"The owner of this business has repeatedly harassed and threatened another vendor at 7th St Public Market to the point she had to close up shop. Pass and spend your money somewhere that isn't owned by such an awful person."}
{"text":"I've had breakfast sandwiches and salads here and everything is delicious. Most recently at 7th street public market, I got the Cobb salad. It far exceeded expectations. Not only was it beautifully decorated, but so colorful and great quality. The fried chicken was perfect, the avocado nice and fresh and the tortilla strips nice and crunchy."}
{"text":"Two visits here and have been very happy both times. Had the Chicken and the Egg the first time and the Croque Madame the second time. Both were cooked perfectly and had a terrific combination of flavors and textures.

My wife both times got the pancakes. She is a pancake connoisseur and judges these among the finest she has eaten. Flavor, texture all just right. It is $6.50 for two so they had better be good! 

The only downside is that they serve all of their food on cutting boards. This works well for a sandwich, but not as well for things that have runny eggs or syrup. Both times my wife was not able to utilize her syrup well because pouring the syrup would have made it run off the cutting board onto the table."}
{"text":"Had to give this place a try, my first time in Charlotte. The market was super cute and the local loaf was even cuter. Really interesting menu items but decided on the steak and egg sandwich. The jalapeño aioli was great and the bread was super soft. Hit the spot after a rough night of drinking!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here yesterday and was more than impressed! Yet another place in the 7th street market that is ridiculously awesome. I got the chicken and the egg. Omg talk about one of the best sandwiches I have ever had in my life. The chipotle cheerwine sauce is super delicious. The chicken is cooked perfectly. This sandwich is seriously enough of a reason for me to drive 20 mins for breakfast on a weekend. 

My friend loved her omelette and the grits. Parmesan and pepper grits were yummy. It is pricey but it's worth the extra $5."}
{"text":"Absolutely love there food I even got to talk to one of the managers they take big pride in there job I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Yesterday we finally made it down to the famed 7th Street Market. My boyfriend and I were on the hunt for delicious coffee, grub and homemade soap. 
    We decided to eat at Local Loaf for breakfast. We both ended up ordering the Chicken and the Egg sandwhich. Let me start of by saying that I did like it, despite the difficulty in eating it.  The biscuit that served as the base for the meal was good not great. A little crumbly when trying to carry the weight of all the filling and fell apart more than once. The breaded chicken tenders were quite astounding and way more flavorful than expected. I like the Cheerwine glaze/sauce but felt that it overpowered the other flavors. Unless you ate the chicken on its own, you couldn't discern it from the sauce. I also would have preferred something other than sprouts but I also couldn't even taste them. 
    For future reference, might I recommend NOT attempting to eat this as a sandwich but more open-faced style.
   I will be back to sample more tasty meals here in future."}
{"text":"Local Loaf is in a pretty cool small business incubator. The steak sandwich I got was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"We ate at this bakery almost every morning of our visit to Charlotte and it never failed to be delicious. It is most definitely a heavy start to the day, but what more could a couple of travelers want really.

The bakery is located in the market and so is effectively just a counter front. There's a huge board with a big array of sandwiches, waffles, fried chicken etc. you place your order, take your number and the food is delivered to you.

We tried their take in the croque monsieur, a Cuban & chicken on biscuit. All were very tasty, but definitely heavy and a bit oily. You can chose a side - the home baked chips were delicious! So, if have done your exercise for the month, this is an excellent spot to eat!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fantastic and such a cool little location in the public market. The burger that I ordered tasted great and I didn't have to wait too long to get it. The chips that came with the meal had to have been freshly made in the back because they definitely were not normal sized potatoes chips. They were very greasy, but also very darn good."}
{"text":"I might have to fly back to this city to get this again. 

Out of town, on a layover, I took an Uber to uptown. I got here at around ~8am on a Thursday so it was pretty quiet. Went for the 'Chicken and the Egg' and boy, it's next level. 

Food took about 20 mins or so to come out on a quiet day but it was worth the wait! The chicken was on point with some great spices and cooked at a optimal level, not dry at all. The biscuit and eggs were great, I loved the jam on everything, really brought it all together. The chips were... chips but they were really well done, well done rustic style chips making me want more. 

Overall, really worth stopping by, some great food out here."}
{"text":"Nice local place downtown in the public market! I got the chicken biscuit with poached egg and some type of honey sauce served with a side of grits it was really good. Chicken fried Nice and crunchy and the sauce had plenty of flavor. Grits were just ok nothing special. Overall the chicken biscuit had nice size definitely a hit!"}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy in my tummy!  On a weekday lunch trip with my girls, Dion L., Katie M. & Simone M., Katie & I decided to try out Local Loaf.

It was such a hard choice, because I love me some sandwiches. AND, I love the Local  Loaf - get it, LOCAL ;) - has local ingredients. After much thinking, I went with The Local Dip & cucumber salad as a side.

I didn't have to wait too long for the food, maybe less than 10 minutes. While I love the presentation of the food on the wooden plank, it made for a bit of a mess every time I went to dip my sandwich in the delicious au jus. The steak was cooked nicely & it was very tender. The baguette bread...mmmm! Not too hard & not too soft, it was just right! You could taste how fresh it was. The cucumber salad was cool & refreshing, with onion & dill. 

The employees here are very friendly. Adam, the owner, was extremely nice & you can tell how proud he is of his shop. 

Prices are reasonable & they use \"Square\" for debit/credit card payments."}
{"text":"Local ingredients. When I say local, I don't just mean local to Charlotte or the surrounding areas, I mean local to the 7th Street Public Market. These guys are using tons of products directly within the market and using them rather well. Coffee from Not Just Coffee, salt(s) from Salts of the Earth, produce from the market, and so on. It's the market's little microcosm of local perfection. 

Hailing from a history of bread baking and jiving with freshly baked bread of any sort, this is the holy grail of local purveyors for yours truly. I love bread. I'll say it again -- I love bread. Wait....Let me reiterate that -- I LOVE BREAD. Adam, owner/Chef, makes some killer breads. Namely, the Pecorino Romano blows my mind every time. We've taken home a few loaves, I've had it on the Cuban sandwich, and we've even paired it with some chili at home. Stellar execution on that recipe. 

Now serving breakfast and lunch -- the menu is tremendous. Can't speak too much to the breakfast items, but lunch is wondrously perfect. I've had the Cuban and the veggie sandwich. The Cuban is heavy, packed with tons of great stuff. Love the pulled pork and the lighter pickles. The mustard concoction is so complex and makes for a flavor dynamic that keeps your palate on the edge of your seat. Served on the Pecorino Romano alongside the clam chowder -- winner. I loved every bit of it and it was a great lunch. The veggie was equally legendary. Whatever that corn spread is brought tears of joy to my eyes. 

Also love the cooler packed with fun bottled sodas -- Sunkist, root beer, Cheerwine, and others. 

Focus: Bread, bread, bread. There is so much love, thought, and expertise put into every loaf. Do yourself a favor and pick one up next time you're at the market."}
{"text":"New in town and decided to try out this place. It was located in an upgraded warehouse of sorts called the 'Public Market'. There were other foods spots in the Market. At any rate, I ordered the steak sandwich and got the house made potato chips to compliment it. Sandwich was incredible!!! Chips we're good but could've used a pinch less of salt. I'll be back to try out some of the breakfast sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Spinach and feta croissant for breakfast! YUM! I love how they serve the croissant on a wooden cutting board with it's name, Local Loaf, burned into the wood! I had a pour over coffee from Not Just Coffee and watched the market come alive!"}
{"text":"Nasty place run by nasty people, no one should dine at this restaurant unless they support harassment and mediocre food"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Local Loaf and was looking forward to Biscuits and Gravy offered on their breakfast menu. However the gravy had a very unusual taste. I took the food back and explained that I tried to like it but it was very unusual. They explained that they used Chorizo sausage. Certainly unexpected and not to my taste. Also it was not cited on the menu that they were using that kind of sausage. I expected them to offer to refund or allow me to choose something else. But all I got was \"I'm sorry\". So low marks for customer service."}
{"text":"Located inside 7th Street Public Market, Local Loaf doesn't necessarily stand out, but the food will knock your socks off. 

The Chicken & The Egg: the BF's favorite sandwich in Charlotte. It's 1/2 open-faced chicken sandwich and half open-faced egg sandwich; SO CLEVER! Between the crispy fried chicken (which he declared his favorite EVER, a bold statement), the cheerwine sauce, the buttery biscuit and the perfectly cooked egg, it left him speechless for the entire breakfast. 

They are one of the few places that brings your food straight to your table, and service was extremely kind! We will definitely make this a repeat visit :)"}
{"text":"What a delicious breakfast option! 

I ordered the Chicken & the Egg with a side of Broccoli Cheddar soup, I wish they served Hash Browns as a side option but this is a smaller space so the menu is limited. This is considered their signature sandwich - chicken tenders, white cheddar, a poached egg, microgreens and a Cheerwine sauce pilled high on a biscuit. It was delicious and filling, the only downside is it was difficult to eat (it was pilled too high and the biscuit was difficult to cut with a knife). The soup was ah-mazing, one of the best Broccoli Cheddar soups that I have consumed. Plus, look at that presentation! I definitely recommend Local Loaf!"}
{"text":"the staffs were friendly,I ordered the french toast, it arrived approximately less than 10 minutes. ok maybe its because I'm not a fan of cinnamon,my $9 french toast was not the best. i still ate it all but will not order it again.
sorry,cinnamon flavor was too strong for my liking, I will try their sandwiches next time though."}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful. I had the Monte Cristo with the cucumber salad an my husband had the Steak and Egg on baguette with the soup of the day. Both were delicious. Service was excellent with a great recommendation from the staff because we were having a difficult time choosing. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because my husband felt they could've put more horseradish dressing on his sandwich. Otherwise it was a wonderful brunch."}
{"text":"The service here is quick and delicious. Here are our favorites in order:

1. Chicken & The Egg Sandwich: the Chipotle Cheerwine Sauce is to die for! 
2. Croque Madame: the poached egg brings the dish together! 
3. Cuban: this comes with a lot of meat!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast while in town and wasn't disappointed.  Ordered the steak sandwich for $10, a little pricey. The steak was cooked perfectly and had good flavor. I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce (a horseradisch and I think jalapeno aoili).  It wasn't spread evenly enough and when I did get a big bite of it it was a huge shock lol.  The house smoked mozz was a good touch though.  All in all a very good breakfast sandwich, but a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"No visit to Charlotte is complete without breakfast at Local Loaf. Eat the chicken and the egg!"}
{"text":"QUICK:  artisanal, quality-crafted food with unique twists on local favorites.  Go try this place!  It's a bit difficult to find (located in the 7th Street Public Market), but well worth it!  Like Chick-Fil-A?   Try to the chicken and egg sandwich....holy S!

DETAILED:  This place is located in the 7th Street Public Market.  Don't try to Waze it or Google Maps it, both took me to wrong places.  Go to the Epicenter, take a left from Trade, then go two blocks and take a right.  Go inside the Public Market and it's the first place on the right inside.

The menu is somewhat limited, but they do a great job with what they offer.  Having recently moved to Charlotte from California, Chick-Fil-A's chicken and egg biscuits have been a local treat.  This one is on STEROIDS!  They give you a home-made biscuit, hand-breaded chicken tenders, micro greens, a poached egg and Cheerwine (which is a Southern soda for those of you not from the South) reduction glaze.  So dope!!!

The people were friendly at the counter.  I called ahead and they actually got the order right (not a knock on them, many other places screw up takeout orders - I guess b/c they figure you won't notice until you're back at home/work).  

The other stuff looks good too.  Give it a shot, I don't think you will be disappointed.

Oh yeah, and they serve breakfast all day, which is a plus in my book!"}
{"text":"They prepare omelets to order with a choice of toast.  Grab a seat and they'll deliver.  Nice."}
{"text":"Step into the 7th Street market on a Saturday and you will see a long line for Local Loaf.. I can't help it but be part of that group. Eager to try this place out.. I ordered the Steak Sandwich with cucumber salad. I love the steak sandwich. Was hoping the bread would've been warm also but the steak is good enough. However the cucumber salad slapped me in my face hard. I didn't realized it's pickled cucumber salad. I'm not a fan of anything \"pickled\". I don't like the \"vinegar taste\". But for those who do. I'm sure it's refreshing for them. My cousin alway get the chicken and eggs sandwich. She never finish it but gets it every time. Hopefully I can go back soon to try it others on the menu. Nothing better than supporting our locals!"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast Sandwich I've ever had!!!

Popped into 7th Street Public Market for a quick bite before a day of exploring the Queen City...and voila...magic!!
The Local Loaf serves the unbelievably delicious 
Chicken and the Egg...with genuinely hand-breaded breast tenders, chipotle-Cheerwine reduction, aged cheddar, poached egg, microgreens on a toasted biscuit. We ordered a side of cheese grits as well. At just over $10, this was the perfect breakfast to split for two. You'd have to be starving to finish it by yourself. 

All elements of the dish were perfectly seasoned, not overly salty and worked absolutely flawlessly together. I cannot wait to try the remainder of their menu items. 

WOW!!!"}
{"text":"I had the veggie sandwich and it was quite tasty.  It fell apart and the bottom of the bread was soggy by the end, but tasty none the less.  My fellow diner had the Hot Steak sandwich.  He was pleased.  Said the flavors were really good and the baguette was great.  We both thought we would see more bread for take home sales.  Only a few loaves were displayed.  I did see them making bread in the back so it sure is fresh! I am very interested in the Chicken and the Egg.  Will be going back to try.  They were out of the Ruben by 12:30p, so it must be good!"}
{"text":"So 2 stars is a little on the generous side. I was so surprised at the quality and taste of the food after reading the reviews. I feel like yelp let me down this time. I got the chicken and the egg biscuit and the biscuit might as well have been a hockey puck. You're in the south and that's like the one thing that should have been right!! No light flaky fluffy biscuit from a bread company?!?? The chicken was okay but nothing great and the cackalacky cheerwine sauce (sp?) was spicy (a good thing) but sooo overly salty and then sickeningly sweet on top of that. Just did not like it at all. My boyfriend got an omelette and well it was ridiculously over cooked. When it arrived it was brown... Basically I'll probably never eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm stuck between 3 and 4 stars with this place. Came here on a Friday morning for brunch and went straight to the counter to order. The girl recommended the breakfast burrito over the biscuit and gravy so I got that and the bf got the chicken and the egg. He absolutely loved his and j was pretty jealous of his food. Oh also both came with the choice of chips or cucumber and vinegar salad. we both chose chips and they were awesome! My issue was with my burrito. It was cooked just as I order and was very hot but there was absolutely no flavor to it. It had green peppers black beans corn chorizo jack cheese in it and it honestly had zero flavor. I had to go to the counter and get a side of Siracha to put on it in order to eat half of it. It just was meh. I was expecting so much more because the chicken and egg that my bf got was great. We also went back to get muffins to take home since those came recommended. I got blueberry and he got carrot and cinnamon. Mine was good he didn't really like his. We both agreed that it would've been better served warm instead of cold. I would come here again though to order a different menu item! Great service also!"}
{"text":"The thing that sets this place apart from another sandwich shop is that they bake their own bread.  The burger I had was also really light for being meaty and bacon-y, thanks to all the greens and light fluffy bread. But despite the localness of it all, my burger wasn't my most memorable sandwich. However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't check this place out.  The environment is chill and sitting outside is definitely a plus.  The staff was really attentive and super quick to bring out our food. 

I wouldn't say local loaf is the most amazing, mind blowing place to get food, but it's definitely not at the bottom of the list either.  It's a great place for a light lunch with an environment that is easy to relax with friends or catch up on some work."}
{"text":"Walked here before heading to nearby museum. 

I'm visiting Charlotte as a tourists. Public Markets are general points of interest so I took my sons here for a quick bite. 

My son and I got the croissant egg sandwich in my other son got a steak and egg sandwich. Both were very well prepared but the sandwich that came with steak and eggs had a little too much horse radish, according to my son. It was also hard for him to eat because the bread was hard and would squeeze out the sandwiches main ingredients.

If it were lunch, we probably would've gone for the sushi across the room. And the less, this is a good bet for a bite."}
{"text":"Had one of their delicious salads for lunch, it was truly amazing. The combination of the roasted beets and a poached egg is so good. I took the chicken curry salad to go for dinner and it was equally delicious. The curry vinaigrette was super and the cranberries and roasted coconut gave it that little bit extra! I will definitely return here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My wife and I got 2 sandwiches, and both were quite disappointing - the Philly Cheesesteak and the Chef's Veggie special.

The Philly Cheesesteak just had some kind of weird squirted cheese on it, not real cheese. It tasted like cheese-flavored mayo, in a bad way. The steak pieces were also weirdly large for a cheesesteak. And the veggie sandwich had some kind of grainy veggie loaf -- weird texture, flavor, etc. Edible, sure, but all around odd.

2 stars instead of 1 because the bread was great.

Maybe their other sandwiches are good, I dunno. But not these two."}
{"text":"First off, did you know that most of the 7th St. Market is open on the weekends for brunch on Saturday?

We had the most delicious experience here. You could even score one meal from Local Loaf and another from the Crepe place about ten steps away to split.

We tried the Chicken and the Egg, Biscuits and Gravy and a make your own omelet. 

We sat at tables in the center of the market and waited maybe ten minutes for the food to come out. You could grab something from Not Just Coffee while waiting on shop the market.

I haven't always liked biscuits and gravy but I must say the ones here were enough to convert anyone. They do their bread right at Local Loaf and the sausage gravy could convert vegetarians. 

Big fan of the Chicken and Egg- I had them pick for me and I was pleased with this. Not too big not too small, perfectly executed egg, Cheerwine sauce giving it a sweet/savory thing with the fried chicken. Comes with a small side of cucumber salad or house made chips. 

if you want something remarkable for brunch (or any other meal but I feel like the wait may be longer then) check out Local Loaf.

Their food is local (does that go without saying?) and you won't fight the crowds for brunch."}
{"text":"We visited 7th street public market for the first time on Saturday and what a lovely little place... it was about lunch time and we hadn't eaten so decided on the local loaf. There was a queue which is always a good sign plus they had a veggie option for myself. I opted for the veggie falafel burger with chips and my husband went for the French toast with maple syrup. Overall, the service was great, the girl behind the desk was very helpful and my food was great. The chips are homemade and deliciously salty and crunchy, the burger was 4/5, it was tasty enough and the bread roll was delicious but it didn't taste much like falafel just like a bean burger tbh. My husband however was really disappointed, his French toast tasted and looked really bland, no sugar or cinnamon flavour and he left half of it on the plate. A real shame for a pricey brunch!! Overall 3/5"}
{"text":"Amazing food and some of the best freshly baked bread you will find in the Queen City. The owner Adam takes tremendous pride in the food he serves. His creative approach to simple and traditional food truly separates Local Loaf from other places in the area. This place alone is one of the main reasons to visit the 7th Street Public Market."}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing. We come for breakfast once a week. The chicken and the egg is outstanding, and their omelets are the best!"}
{"text":"Local Loaf. You serve me delicious sandwiches on beautiful wooden boards.

You let me order breakfast sandwiches all day! And your savory, lunch choices always delight. 

Your Reuben sandwich makes my list of top 3 best Reubens I've ever had. 

Your \"Not Just\" BLT pairs two of my favorites 7th street vendors, you and Not Just Coffee, between two pieces of freshly baked rustic ciabatta. Your switch of Not Just Coffee cured pork belly for bacon must have been divinely inspired. 

Every baked goodie I've had from you has been tasty. I especially love your raspberry chocolate chip scone.

Yes, you'll set me back $8-$10 per sandwich, but I declare that you are worth every penny!

I can't wait to visit you for brunch on Sunday."}
{"text":"We stopped in the market to get some coffee and while we were here decided to get some breakfast as well. I had seen several people trying the pancakes and decided to get some too, they had a variety of flavors which was great. I had the blueberry and my husband had the banana. They said they had a bit of a wait for them but it turned out even longer than predicted. It turned out ok though because they were delicious and it was so great seeing them make the batter fresh. One of my friends that eats meat had the steak and egg baguette and said it was delicious, she got it with the homemade chips which I tried and they were amazing. They are much thicker than most that places make and were smothered in salt and pepper. I can't wait to try some of their other items!"}
{"text":"When you've got a few hours to kill in Charlotte and you're wondering what there's to do, you'll get excited about something called the 7th street public market. An interesting \"market,\" that I would call more of a food court close to the financial district, but you'll find one or two interesting stores to walk through... And, when you get hungry, you've got plenty of options as we did. 

Local Loaf was the clear winner in terms of what I wanted to eat, but I was hesitant knowing this place was a \"bakery\" and I was going to order a burger, but the Local Loaf Burger with the \"salad\" was great! Don't worry if you don't like salad, it's actually pickles!"}
{"text":"The Local Loaf.. where have you been all my life?! I finally tried them the other day for lunch and they did not disappoint! I came around lunch time and got the Green tomato BLT with the cucumber salad and my mom, who was with me, got the Fried Chicken Cobb. Our food was delivered to us in about 5 minutes and was nice and warm. 

The Cobb salad looked out of this world and it was huge! It could easily be split with someone and the amount of avocado on it was outrageous- it had to be almost a full cado! The dressing was also delightful. However, the winner here was the BLT.

The sandwich was one of the best BLTs I've ever had. The green tomato was cooked to perfection and kind of tasted like it was breaded in quinoa. Very good. But I forgot to mention- it was topped off with their white pimento cheese! It was savory with a kick of flavor. The cucumber salad was also a great side choice, but they also offer house made chips or a side salad.

I can't believe I've lived in Charlotte for almost 4 years and have never been to Local Loaf- next time I'm getting a breakfast sandwich!!! They look and sound BOMB."}
{"text":"Solid choice for sandwiches if you're in the area. Definitely a lot of options I would like to try."}
{"text":"Really impressive show of talent and culinary sensibility from chef and baker Adam Spears. Handmade croissants, brioche, bread and biscuits are delicious and the flavor pairings creatively excellent. Pickled blackberries and scallops, yes please! Grits croutons, crisp fried anchovy and aged cheese pair with fresh romaine and house dressing in a well balanced act of culinary genius. This is a must-try foodie spot with a high level of creativity and execution at ridiculously affordable prices. I envy locals who can eat here regularly."}
{"text":"We had an all family meal from Local Loaf instead of sourcing from different vendors. Kids had the choc chip pancakes with bacon, wife had the breakfast burrito and I had the blue line cheesesteak. Everything was 5 stars... The pancakes are probably the best I've ever had (crispy on outside, chewy inside), burrito had delicious seasoning, and the Jalapeño queso on my perfectly toasted cheesesteak baguette was awesome. Can't wait to come back..."}
{"text":"Just fantastic in every way.  I had the Chicken and the Egg. I cannot believe I didn't find this place sooner!"}
{"text":"If you're at 7th Street Market and are looking for a delicious breakfast, I HIGHLY recommend Loaf. It's the best bang for your buck and leaves a bang inside your mouth [flavor bang that is!] They serve up their food with class and it just makes you want to take a photo to post to any and every social media site, because it looks divine. The kicker is that it truly IS divine and you will NOT be disappointed. I recommend trying the basics: BECB [made that up, but it's a bacon, egg & cheese on a biscuit]. YUM! Out of the handful of breakfast options I tried, Local Loaf definitely took the cake...I mean biscuit!"}
{"text":"We ordered the 'Chicken and the Egg', the regular glazed donut, and the mixed berry muffin -- all to share. It was a lot of food for the money. 

Hands down, the 'Chicken and the Egg' is the best breakfast biscuit I've ever eaten. The chicken had a fantastic scald. The poached egg was cooked to order and to perfection (which I'm weird about how my poached egg is cooked so, this is high praise). The chicken and egg combined with the grilled toasted biscuit, aged white cheddar, and chipotle cheerwine sauce was a culinary balance without relying on heavy salt to make an impression. Served with house-made potato chips, this plate is a high fly, out of the park, home run. 

The regular glazed donut was the surprise of the order. It was not sicky sweet and/or dense as in your standard donut fare; but rather it had an airy, meaty quality making it enjoyable to chew and wanting to savor every bite. Seriously, when was the last time you wanted to savor a donut? It's that good. 

The mixed berry muffin was tasty and is solid to stand on its own if you need a muffin fix. But, it was so overshadowed by the donut and biscuit it did not get very much attention. We left half on the plate at the end of the meal. 

If you are visiting the uptown Charlotte area or live in the area, make time to visit Local Loaf for breakfast. And, although we did not eat from the lunch/dinner menu, I imagine these items will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I really like this place. One of my favorite spots in 7th Street market. Adam and his staff are awesome. So lets talk food. I can't say I have a favorite b/c Adam keeps changing the menu on me. But that's a good thing you can never get board with the food here. They had a fried bologna sandwich. I miss that one so much. You really can't miss with anything on the menu there. I need to get back there and see what's on the menu now."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service

Once again Local loaf is one of my favorites,  I went in yesterday for the \"chicken and the egg\" and they were out of biscuits so I waited for them to make a new batch,  they were so friendly with complimentary drinks and the owner even came out and apologized about the situation and offered me a coupon,  the chicken & the egg was delicious and well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem! I had an excellent breakfast here over the weekend and their delicious food and generous portions already have me wanting to come back. Local Loaf is located inside 7th Street Public Market along with several other local businesses.

The duck and waffle in other yelp reviews is what brought me here, but I didn't see it on the menu during our visit. But no problem, they had some other tasty items to try! I ordered the Croque Madame, which is honestly a cheese lover's dream breakfast. Melty cheese on the inside AND the outside! Also, you could tell the quality of the bread was really good. The sandwich was huge and I could only eat about 2/3rds of it. I even enjoyed the unique presentation of the sandwich on a cool wooden board, instead of the typical tray. 

We had no problems with crowds or seating since we arrived right when they opened, but I can see that seating could become more difficult during lunch as the other restaurants start to open for the day too. Also, I know parking downtown can be a little tricky. I wish we had known that you can park in the deck next to 7th Street Public Market and have your ticket validated inside the market. If you do, then you get your first 90 minutes of parking for free! We'll definitely be doing this next time, instead of driving around downtown trying to find free street parking."}
{"text":"Went to the local loaf in 7th street market this past weekend after walking past it many times before but never opting to try it out. Local Loaf has their bread in shops all across town and It's already made a good impression on me. Going to the market have me a chance to try one of their sandwiches as well. 

I got the Cuban sandwich with house made chips. The Cuban was fresh and delicious. The meat was almost in a patty and crispy on the top and bottom from the grill. The sandwich wasn't too big that it left me feeling stuffed but was a good enough size to fill me up. The chips were really good as well, but would have been marginally better if they were on smaller pieces. 

My wife also got the portobello sandwich and she really enjoyed it. 

I can't wait to go back and get a breakfast sandwich. The photos look really good and you can get 15% off with Yelp check in. 

They are opening a location in NoDa at some point in the future which will be much more convenient for me. Can't wait for that!"}
{"text":"Bread was good, but this place is usually closed/ closing when I'm there. They reluctantly sold me the last loaf but were not happy that I delayed closing. I park for work in the deck above this place & have no place to pick up anything better the convenience store bread on he way home, so I've been disappointed that this place just isn't working out for me."}
{"text":"There are multiple options here for a foodie. The entrees I've tried on two separate occasions are the pancakes (unique & delicious) and the omelets (solid, safe choice). I highly recommend dining here when you visit the market."}
{"text":"Do not give this establishment your business. Gross. Both the owner and the product, that is."}
{"text":"This place is totally over-rated.  As is 7th street Market in general.  The employees at Local Loaf were rude and the owner was even worse! The food has the potential to be good but I cannot support a business that does not treat customers well.  With all the good and locally owned food places in Charlotte- there is no need to go here."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. I enjoyed the \"Chicken & The Egg\" breakfast plate. The fried chicken tender, poached egg, sweet chipotle sauce over a dense buttermilk biscuit was near perfection. 
Get the cucumber and onion side! They share a few hints to make them at home! Excellent fridge pickles!"}
{"text":"The food here was very good. I had the chicken and the egg and it was amazing. Definitely not your average chix biscuit. The cucumber salad went very well with this dish. There are plenty of menu items and baked goods to try from and the staff is extremely helpful when ordering. Great hospitality. Will definitely return soon."}
{"text":"Since I've moved to Charlotte, this is my favorite place for a Turkey Burger. Seasoned well, applewood bacon, yummy mustard, and the bread is phenomonal. The perk, the people there are always very nice and personable...yes and the bread! 

The Breakfast Burrito is delicious! I don't even like eggs like that but this bad boy is large and filled with sweet potatoes, black beans, and more.  
My only gripe, the grits are no bueno, tasteless to say the least and I've tried them twice. 

Otherwise great spot.

Tip: Park in the garage, bring your ticket and get it validated at one of the merchant, whoever has the stamp. You need to just buy something from the market and you'll earn 90 minute validation. Don't even try to street park or parking lot, its not worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious! Perfect spot for a laid back brunch with the convenience of multiple options for everyone within the market. I had the steak and eggs, after being undecided on what to get. Did not disappoint. The staff is very welcoming and friendly as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Freshly baked goods mmmmm the aroma. It will linger in your car on your drive home, in your kitchen for days, and more importantly the taste is SO MUCH BETTER than that grocery store loaf. Why waste your money? I happened across Local loaf at 7th street market which I highly recommend stopping by. Local loaf has an assortment of baked goods including the infamous croissant. I would get one of those to treat yo self and then a loaf for the week ahead! Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! I got the Cuban and hubs got the hot Italian. We both got the cucumber salad and it was really good too. The honey mustard sauce on the Cuban was so good and the pork was delicious and flavorful! Their breakfast menu looks pretty amazing too!"}
{"text":"Visited during the Kansas City and Panthers game - good food/nice location near to the stadium and good service"}
{"text":"had the croque madam and chicken and the egg. both were great dishes! what I liked most is the description matched exactly with what was delivered. the service was great, and the complete dishes had various ingredients that were highlighted based on the bite. croque madam is extremely rich, you've been warned :)"}
{"text":"Great local food at an affordable price.  Love their baked goods but their hot steak sand which is the best! Cheers!"}
{"text":"We visited the Seventh Street Market on a Sunday morning. I had their croissantwich. It is a toasted croissant sandwich with scrambled egg, bacon, and cheese. Customers order at the counter and get a number to display at their table in the open marketplace. When the food is ready, it is delivered to your table. Although this wasn't exactly a healthy meal, I did enjoy it."}
{"text":"The people that work here are all so nice. We are Sunday regulars. The only thing I wish they did differently was using less butter."}
{"text":"The food here is hit and miss. Sometimes it's decent, and twice this week the eggs have been waaaaay too salty. I tried to wipe the salt off with my napkin. 
The flat boards they serve the food on is also irritating because the food kinda flows where ever. My salty over easy eggs had their yolks cracks and the yolk ended up on the server because the stupid boards don't have sides to hold the food together. Won't waste any more money here. 

Also, why would ANYONE who wants to support a misogynistic owner who treats people like sh*t?"}
{"text":"When we went to the 7th Street Market to get lunch and do some shopping, I was initially disappointed to see that Local Loaf still had a coming soon sign on their location. Fortunately, the sign was outdated, because they were very much open.

I ordered the fried chicken sandwich, and it came with a poached egg on top. It was pretty dang tasty... the biscuit was flavorful and flaky, the chicken was moist and well-seasoned, and the egg added that extra deliciousness that only a runny yolk can. I only wish that the biscuit on which it was served had been a bit larger, since it got messy toward the end. 

I'm glad to see Local Loaf in this space, and it will definitely become a regular weekend lunch spot."}
{"text":"Most delicious decadent breakfast sandwiches in the world. So reasonably priced for so much food. It's worth the walk and having to find a table in the dining hall."}
{"text":"Excellent, high-end restaurant-quality food in the 7th Street Market. Come hungry -- the Cuban filled my up for hours. Worth a trip to the market just to score a sandwich here!"}
{"text":"Turkey burger with Brie was excellent. Great paring of ingredients. 
The muffins were too dry for my taste.
I'd definitely go again and try other menu items."}
{"text":"This business regularly conducts and condones harassment of its neighbors, most notably expressing misogynistic animosity towards Gateau Baking. Never expect my business again, and count on me spreading the word regarding your conduct."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place because I had sent my sister here before and I had never been able to go. She got a great sounding chicken breakfast sandwich so I needed to see what it was all about. 

We walked around 7th street public market which was buzzing because it was Sunday and decided to order at Local Loaf. My husband and I ordered the Chicken and the Egg which was a beautifully fried piece of chicken breast, on a buttermilk biscuit, with aged white cheddar, a cheerwine sauce and a fried egg. It was really tasty - I could have done without the cheese as it was sort of congealed by the time it got to the table. We ordered a side of fruit to go with the sandwich and I was pleasantly surprised that it was blueberries, strawberries and grapes. Not your run of the mill cheaper fruit salad options. 

My friends ordered the same sandwich and an order of the special of the day: tamales. They looked really good and they had grits on the side and said they were great! 

The people working the registers were very friendly. 

My real gripe which sort of tainted the whole experience ... we ordered on two separate tickets one after the other and our meals came out completely spaced.  So my husband and my sandwich came out first, then about 8 minutes later came the second sandwich and then about 10 minutes after that the tamales came. So almost 20 minutes after the first meal. The tamales and the second sandwich were on the same ticket so I'm confused as to why they were sent out at two totally radically different times. 

Good was still good, but wish the delivery to the table was a little more refined."}
{"text":"I came to the local loaf and had to try what they are most know for, their chicken and the egg breakfast!  It was very good, it was like two separate dishes in one on one side you had the egg, microgreens, and some of their glaze.  The other side was amazing chicken tenders, aged white cheddar, and their glaze.  My personal favorite was the tender side.  I also got a blueberry cream Danish that was fantastic as well!"}
{"text":"I used a Groupon for this restaurant.  I did not know what to expect.  I loved the Hot Steak sandwich.  However, I did not care for the chicken/egg combination.  Not a fan of the house chips.  I will go back but next time I will try something else."}
{"text":"The Ham and Brie is EVERYTHING. My friends think they have the best burger in town. It is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I really like local loaf, their bread is delicious and there sandwiches are great. I love the atmosphere of the public market so I will certainly be back! The people that work here are cool too."}
{"text":"I work on 7th street so frequent the 7th street market. First, the guy who works the front is so friendly and just a genuine guy. I've enjoyed most of the food I have gotten here. While a bit pricey, the ingredients are quality. 

We once ordered a large order in the morning and those sandwiches were disappointing. Would recommend getting something fresh there."}
{"text":"Nice spot for brunch on in the 7th Street market . I really enjoy the bacon and blueberry waffles. The waffle is a waffle of the day , so subject to change. The most famous dish here is 'the chicken and the egg'. I'm not a fan of their grits , but overall this is a great brunch spot to come to . Unfortunately, breakfast here does not come with a drink , so it can get pricy eating here ."}
{"text":"Three of the five of us had lunch at the Local Loaf today for lunch.  I had the hot steak sandwich with chees, arugula, garlic aoli, and horseradish.  It was delicious.  The arugula was a nice addition instead of the usual lettuce.  It was served with homemade chips.  Fast service."}
{"text":"Awful service. We ordered brunch for 3 and waited for over 50 minutes before canceling. When we asked about our food, the cook yelled at us and told us to go to IHOP. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"This place has breakfast or lunch all day. Great service with a variety of choices. The waffles we're good, but not ass crisp as I prefer. The scorpion fish poboy was great and the chicken biscuit is to die for."}
{"text":"My favorite place at the 7th street Market. Friendly staff, great food and speedy service. I visit at least once and week when I'm in Charlotte:) I usually order the Breakfast Croissant sandwich with a cucumber onion salad. They have great options: sandwiches, salads, burgers, and muffins to name a few."}
{"text":"During this past visit, my family embarked on a journey called \"breakfast carnage\". We basically got just about one of everything from the pastry case. My kids were hungry beavers gnawing Pain au Chocolat, shooting crumbs like a wood chipper. These things are so flaky they need some Head and Shoulders.

The Ham and Swiss Croissant was straight up perfect, as was the Apricot Danish featuring a fresh half apricot sleeping on a pillow of pastry cheese.

Go Chocolat, it's your Birthday, get your Pain on!

Blueberry muffin explosive goodness!! Smush the morsels that fell from your mouth together and make another muffin. Then eat it again. 

Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"This place is located a market full of stores which I love. I have been here 2-3 times and had a few of the breakfast sandwiches.  First thing I must say is everything I had was good they use only top end ingredients in their food.  My bacon egg & cheese on whole wheat tastes so fresh and was pretty big too.  It filled me up my sister had one the 4 speciality sandwhiches they make and I had a bite and it was great.  I cant wait to go back try some more items off the menu.  I also could see the bread they were making and can I just say the smell filled the room and made me even hungrier!"}
{"text":"This place has been a solid go-to for breakfast and lunch again and again. For breakfast I'm a fan of something simple like a bagel or pastry although their omlet did not disappoint. For lunch I haven't been let down but I was highly impressed with their BLT featuring fried green tomatoes (get the chips with it, the cucumber salad is for higher tastes).

Pro tip- while you wait shop around the market"}
{"text":"First timer to 7th Street Public Market/Local Loaf. Ordered the hot steak sandwich for lunch-it was just OK, wasn't blown away. The horseradish garlic aioli and red onion jam on the sandwich were an amazing combo though.

Expected the bread to be the star of the dish, but I would actually say the homemade potato chips were. Waited 20 min for my food, that came out lukewarm. Good food overall, however, would try somewhere different next time."}
{"text":"You only get one chance to make a first impression, and this restaurant/bakery, being at the front of the 7th St. Public Market, does a fine job of impressing.  

With a focus on using local ingredients, including produce and spices from other market purveyors, Local Loaf crafts a number of fantastic sandwiches and pastries for both breakfast and lunch.  With a recently expanded breakfast menu, you can order just about anything you like, from fresh fried eggs to sinfully fluffy biscuits topped with local honey.  Count me as a particular fan of their seasonal scones, including peach and chocolate/raspberry, as of late.  Combined with a cup of artisan coffee just a few steps away, that's a proper way to get your morning started.  

Not that the heartier sandwiches play second fiddle here.  The proof of quality here is in the details.  For example, the common chicken and egg biscuit is elevated to the next level with a sweet and spicy glaze sauce and micro greens to add a bit of freshness to the final product.  And while I am no fan of buffets, in general, I have tried the Sunday brunch buffet here and the attention to quality is just as apparent and made for quite a satisfying meal.

Ordering is easy at the counter and all entrees are delivered wherever you most like to sit at the market, even at the coffee bar across the way.  Just take your number with you and the staff brings your order to you, on a nice butcher block that feels just as artisan as the craft fare that sits atop it.

Do check out the breads all baked in house too.  The baguette is phenomenal and there are several specialty breads that change with the days and the seasons, so feel free to ask the staff what's fresh.  Local Loaf is a welcome addition to the market and it's great to see independent businesses with such a showcase to show off their talents.  These guys have easily earned their spot up front."}
{"text":"Visited at 12:45 pm on a Monday and waited almost 45 minutes for a stone cold, mediocre, and pricey steak sandwich. Doubtful that I would have received my food if I hadn't eventually followed up, and even then the staff was non-apologetic. My dining companions portabella sandwich was very good and arrived more promptly, but there are more reliable and tasty options in the public market. Would avoid."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!   We all had a variety of menu items and they were all amazing!!   Still thinking about this mornings breakfast and wishing I had gotten a meal to take home for dinner!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. I ordered the Chicken and the Egg and was definitely not expected the size of the dish for the price I paid. The chicken was perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of spice. The eggs were cooked perfectly as well. The sauce on top tied everything together and each bite was incredible."}
{"text":"I love coming to 7th Street Market for brunch at Local Loaf and ordering chocolate chip pancakes with the Jack Daniel syrup. This pancake is unlike any pancake that's ever come out of my kitchen! It's a little bit crispy and crunchy and the flavors are awesome. I bring most out-of-town visitors here to show off how cool my city is :)"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot at the 7th street market. Great bread, sandwiches, and salads. There is a make your own local six pack right across the seating hall which pairs well on the weekend. The Levine new South museum is right next door and is a good way to spend an hour."}
{"text":"Great place to walk a few blocks and avoid hotel breakfast. Everything's fresh  and lovingly made right there. Great pastries and biscuits.

Make sure and check out the small stands in the back of the space. There are some great specialty vendors."}
{"text":"Can't agree more!!! But I prefer to walk, that is why I weigh 108 pounds. I get to eat two without blinking an eye. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I was in the market today for lunch.  I decided to try Local Loaf and have to say, the jury's out for me.
I went for the Steak Sandwich, it was very good.  For what it was I felt it was overpriced.  Marinated skirt steak, horseradish aioli, microgreens, and some kind of onions on a baguette.  The bread was good and freshly baked and it was a good sandwich but again there wasn't much to it.  I am understanding of the fact that they use good quality ingredients but for $10 I expected a bit more.  It was served with either chips or cucumber salad.  I must say that I loved the cucumber salad....tons of oregano (one of my favorite spices) and cucumbers and onions in a mildly sweet vinegar.
My wife had the veggie sandwich which was served on jalapeno foccacia.  The bread was way overbaked and the crust of the bread was burnt.  It should not have been served.  She went to the counter to ask for different bread and one of the ladies commenced to argue with my wife for about 5 minutes about how the bread was slightly overbaked and some BS about eggwash caramelizing on the top causing a darkening effect.  This is a prime example of just because you have a chefs coat on, doesn't mean you know what the heck you're talking about.  She wound up getting a new piece of bread but it would have been better if she got it without an argument from the staff. 
I like the market as a whole and this experience was just ok, IMO.  I wasn't taken aback by what I had at Local Loaf, but do appreciate and like the concept but for what they charge they should know that they have to step us the customer service and make sure everything their serving is top notch."}
{"text":"Super nice staff, the blonde girl (I didn't get her name :( ) was super nice and helpful when suggesting things to order. 

I tried the breakfast burrito and it was just okay. I'd say about two stars factoring in the price. It was an okay portion but lacked any real flavor, I could only eat about half of it before my stomach could handle no more, which was disappointing considering it topped $10. The tortilla did taste good too. They were out of fruit BUT thanks to the girl working, I chose a great replacement... the house made chips were wonderful and i did eat all of those partially because I was very hungry but also because they were good.

Extra star is for service, they really are very helpful.i don't think however that I would be back."}
{"text":"Delicious! We had the biscuits and gravy and the French toast and both were fantastic. It was wonderful having a coffee place inside too"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Last weekend I went to the 7th Street Market for the first time. Local Loaf was highly recommended, so I ordered the Chef's Waffles. This plate came with blueberry waffles, two slices of bacon and eggs. The waffles were soft  and layered with an icing! The only thing I wish was that I had some syrup - not because the Waffle needed it but because I just love syrup. Definitely come here!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast and coffee at the 7th Street Public Market on Sunday morning. If you're ever looking for a place to grab a healthy breakfast, try the Local Loaf! It was delicious. My omelet had spinach, tomato, peppers and onion. I love that you can build your own! I also had Not Just Coffee with my breakfast."}
{"text":"They put a nice twist on traditional breakfast and lunch classics, such as biscuits and gravy. We ordered these with eggs and bacon. To our surprise , the gravy had a distinct curry flavor, which added an interesting touch. Though the portion wasn't huge, we didn't end up being able to finish it because of the unexpectedly powerful flavor. I love that they also bake their own bread for this stand, and would definitely try a lunch sandwich on a fresh slice of wheat bread when I visit again!

This place is also nice because it's in the public market, so there are many different options if you're with a group of people. I think it would be a great lunch option in a weekend afternoon, and will keep it in mind when I'm back in the area!"}
{"text":"My husband and I's first experience with this restaurant was out of this world Excellent! However, since then I have since noticed a serious decline in the quality of service and the quality of food. The staff is beyond rude to the customers whether they are busy or not. With said rudeness they still manage to demand a tip and proceed to get a serious attitude if not a big enough tip is given. The last time my husband and i went during the weekend the poached egg was extremely undercooked and gave both my husband and i food poisoning for the weekend. With all that being said i decided to give them another try today. I figured going during a weekday i would get better results. WRONG. Same rude service and same quality of food. My lyon potatoes which costs me an extra 2.00 was unrecognizably over cooked. I am saddened to take this place off of my list of eating establishments however, until big changes are made it has to be done."}
{"text":"Wandered in yesterday for quick lunch and browsed the menu. I was get ready to move on, but the clerk mentioned they serve breakfast all day and maybe I'd like that. SOLD! I treated myself to some comfort food (already a hard half day of business meetings) -- biscuits and gravy. And I've never had any close to equal. They were worth every calorie I consumed. It was delicious and very filling. Is the gravy (amazing) over cheese toast (what????), with generous side of thick cut delicious bacon and fluffy scrambled eggs. I was in heaven. A tad expensive maybe, but completely worth it. I'll go back for other choices too -- if I can bypass the biscuits and gravy...."}
{"text":"After hearing loads of reviews about this happening place, my first instinct was to go to Not Just Coffee. 

I was surprised when I was immediately greeted by the workers of Local Loaf. I was lost down town, and I asked them for directions, they gave me accurate directions. After I got my cup of coffee, I decided to go to them for an afternoon snack. 

The man who took my order was Jaris.(Like Paris with a J- like he said). He was wonderful, wonderful reccomendations and extremely professional. 

The asiago croissant he treated me with was delightful, probably the best I've had in a while-- Speaking from a New Yorker's tastebud, of good food at local joints.

Yes, I'm going to drive about 25 minutes out of my way to get a croissant from Local Loaf, and for the service I experienced here. 10/10."}
{"text":"No complaints, from service all the way to the food. I ordered the chicken and egg an I'm in love. So far the best breakfast I've had in Charlotte and I will be back."}
{"text":"Very average food. Slow service. Order was served incorrect. On a positive note the staff was friendly but seemed overwhelmed."}
{"text":"We love everything here! We especially loved their meat pies which we were disappointed to find out, aren't being made much anymore. We also love how they have a stand at the NoDa farmer's market!"}
{"text":"So I stopped by here on my lunch break. I have an hour for said break. It took them 45 mins to bring my burger out. Needless to say, I was NOT HAPPY. There was no kind of warning that the wait would be so long so I was completely blind sided by this. They don't have fries which is sad for me and even sadder that their chips are bland. They don't put any condiments on their burgers. The actual meat and bun were yummy but the wait time definitely left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"7th Street Public Market is one of the places I take out of town guests. There's a variety of food options in an open market setting. Local Loaf and Hazelnut are some of my favorites here. The chicken and the egg is my go to entree with a side of cucumber salad unless they have beer cheese and broccoli soup. There was one time the beer cheese and broccoli soup was congealed. But normally it's pretty good. Just got the chicken and the egg again and at least three people asked me where I got it because it looked so good. My friend said people were coming up and looking at my food and staring. So here is a pic."}
{"text":"Love this place, a real gem! A must do in Charlotte.

In a very cool market that you can explore while you wait for your food. Friendly staff is always appreciated.

Best burger we've had in a long time. It comes with a tomato jelly? What? Delicious. All fresh ingredients, made to order. Comes with home made potato chips."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!! Amazing!! What's better than Bfast thats served all day...? Yes, they have salads, soup, sandwiches and burgers including 3 veggie burger options- falafel, portobello and broccoli but the BREAKFAST is OMG good! Fresh, quality ingredients made to order and the service is surprisingly fast. Speaking of service, everyone was very nice and they personally deliver the food to your table. We had moved to a far corner location to find the ONLY outlets for our laptops (note to 7th Street Public Market- we need outlets!!!) and the service staff at Local Loaf came and found us!! Prices are mid-range with most items at $10 and worth every bite. Overall a Yelp success and looking forward to coming back again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Local Loaf is a unique French bakery and brunch spot in the 7th Street Market that is anything but ordinary. I wouldn't call the food here authentic French cuisine, but it is very good and the portion sizes are huge. They definitely cook everything with the quality you'd expect from French cuisine and give you the portion sizes you'd expect in America. I came here early Sunday morning for breakfast. Seating is limited in the market, so plan accordingly. They do validate parking! So park in the parking deck. Because it's located in the market, you can get coffee and other foods from the other vendors there. 

For breakfast, I had the chicken and the egg. It is the French take on a chicken egg biscuit, and it was amazing. The freshly breaded and fried chicken tenders were juicy, crunchy, and seasoned so well. They sat on top a flat top grilled biscuit, and the chicken was covered in an awesome melted white cheddar and Cheerwine chipotle sauce. The sauce was sweet with a touch of spice and combined with the incredible cheddar, the flavor profile was just unreal. You also get a poached egg and some micro greens. I chose to get a side of grits, which were also cheesy and tasty. 

Overall, I would highly recommend trying Local Loaf for breakfast. The chicken biscuit was huge, very flavorful, making it the perfect way to start your morning."}
{"text":"Ordered biscuits n gravy - biscuit is good, eggs were over cooked (their heat was too high-amateur move on scrambled eggs), bacon was good. 

And now the gravy... it was cold as an Eskimo's nipple in the winter without a shirt on.  Theres no way this was held to standards of temperature... hence the \"90\" sanitation rating score that is somewhat hidden.  They over peppered the gravy with an Italian seasoning reminiscent of how i would flavor an Italian sausage pizza... maybe they are on to something there, who knows.

I hate the places that have a \"tip\" line before you get any food or experience any service. Well have no fear millennials i am not like my peers, i confidently mark... no tip followed by \"have a nice day\". Then if i like the experience i hand them cash afterwards... this should be the norm

I also tasted the grits, taste bc i would not eat another bite...

The worst grits in charlotte- which also consisted of an up-charge. Literally gagged when i bit into the cold pile of shit that it was.

Good day mates! (as i finished writing this, just now, more pizza pepper just came unstuck from my teeth... eeewww)"}
{"text":"We were very excited to give this place a try, but ended up so disappointed.  We ordered three sandwiches. I took my first bite of my sandwich and it tasted a little burnt so I looked at the bottom of the bread and it was charcoal. They put that burnt side down on the bottom, but the top half looked fine. That is just unforgivable. If you burn the bread, re-fire. Don't try to hide it! The egg on the sandwich was also raw. Not over easy - raw. Most of the \"white\" was totally clear, the yolk was room temperature. It was disgusting. The other sandwich was dry and the steak was tough and over-cooked. I had a couple of the homemade chips they put on the side. The first couple were tasty, but the rest were burnt and bitter tasting. Other sandwich tasted decent but the bread they chose didn't work for such a wet sandwich and the bread became a soggy, crumbling sponge. One of the worst experiences trying a new place.  They clearly don't respect their customers and don't mind sending out inedible food. Horrible."}
{"text":"Currently at local loaf, ordered the expensive $13 Tostada Cobb Salad. I got here at 11:30 when things were still quiet, and there was no line at the register. I've been waiting over 32 minutes and still have not received my to go salad."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. It is close to the center square, so I walked from my hotel, no need to find parking. It is located in a market with other neat eateries to explore. I love the seating layout. Good for groups. 

I'm mixed on the food.  I ordered a waffle, which looked great, but being from out of town I didn't realize it was a \"Waffle of the Day\" mix. Do I was surprised it was a blueberry Waffle when it came out. I don't eat blueberry. So I would've appreciated if they would've just mentioned what the flavor of the day was, because it wasn't posted anywhere and they only serve that flavor, there were no plain waffle options. The server was not happy when I said I didn't want it. But she resolved the issue by bringing me a pancake which was different because they actually deep fry their pancakes. It was pretty good. The eggs, grits, and bacon were ok. 

They also have a giant donut that was pretty tasty as well."}
{"text":"The chicken and biscuits were awesome!!! The sauce on them was perfect. We loved eating here!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a candy coated sugar bomb yesterday noon and got to chatting with our lunch company about their lunch so on Sunday bun-day we're here! The chicken and egg for my lovely bride, biscuits and gravy for me.
Her sandwich was a crazy good tender moist wad of chickens open-faced under Cheerwine sauce on a half-biscuit with a poached egg served on the other half on a board with a few too few hand-chipped potatoes.
Biscuits and gravy could have used better planning on my part. Came on a board with two eggs up and no hash browns to gush into the yolks (proud of myself that I didn't end up wearing it.) Quite good but I think the rue got away from the cook on this one as the gravy as a bit brown. Thick cut firm bitey bacon
Wanted a donut but no, nutz! Opted for a coffee cake muffin which was almost as good (hint: no donuts left but several muffins) and also came on a board. very very odd."}
{"text":"Inside 7th Street Market among the many MANY options available to you I personally find Local Loaf to be the best. The name initially sounds deceiving, not to mention the loaves of delicious bread lying about. Don't fret, they serve meals and sides not just loaves of baked goodness.

You won't be disappointed by the various concoctions they throw up here on the daily. They even have specials on the best days. This past weekend I had a lightly cooked tuna steak (raw in the middle = great!) topped with bacon, avocado and an over-easy egg between two giant halves of toast. It was a fantastic meal especially for the price (less than $15 - not bad considering the size of that tuna cut). When not looking at the specials there are plenty of salad concoctions, breakfast sandwiches and tasty burgs. Probably the most ubiquitous item of note here is the chicken and the egg sandwich(?) that is more of a fork and knife sandwich. So good!

They seem to drop an over-easy egg on several of their menu items which ends up making most of the sandwiches fork+knife (as I mentioned above). On that note, while the wooden cutting boards make for a truly neat serving platter they do not work with the runny over easy egg. Be warned: you will dirty the tables when you break the yolk. I think they'd do well to pick and choose how they serve certain dishes here. Otherwise, I highly recommend grabbing your weekend lunch at Local Loaf. Then run over to Viva Raw or Not Just Coffee for a drink."}
{"text":"Best bread in Charlotte! The Local Dip sandwich is my current favorite. Fresh baguette piled with tender pot roast and onions. Slurp. Cannot leave without taking a baguette or 2 for home. Perfect in the oven or toaster. Amazing dipped in ...well...anything you like to dip bread in."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. And it's located inside 7th Street Market, which is amazing in itself. If you want to have a perfect Saturday morning head there, get a coffee from Not Just Coffee, brunch from Local Loaf, and just browse around looking at trinkets and buying samples and possibly heading home with a tub of homemade pimento cheese. 

I felt it was my duty to get \"The Chicken and the Egg,\" being from Salisbury and all (home of Cheerwine). Let me tell you it did not disappoint. Biscuit was perfect, chicken was perfect, and everything tasted great together. Warning: this is not an eat with your hands sandwich-- way too huge and messy. Knife and fork it is. BF got the \"Steak and Egg\" and it was great as well. 

We also ordered a loaf of their sourdough to take home. So fresh out of the oven they couldn't even slice for us. Was wonderful with the pimento cheese we picked up from Virginia's. 

Can't wait to go back and try some of the other menu items!"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple times while at Not Just Coffee in the market and we've been happy every time.  The first time, we had blueberry and banana pancakes which were amazing although they did take a little more time to come out than you'd expect.  Well worth the wait.  The second time we ordered an omelet with tomatoes and green peppers and a side of parmesan and black pepper grits.  Oh man, those grits!  Creamy, salty, satisfying.  They use a lot of local ingredients from Greeneman Farms which is also located in 7th Street Public Market (an awesome place to be).  

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try local loaf for a while since moving to Charlotte. Whenever I come to 7th Street market, I find myself eyeing the delicacies coming out of their kitchen. I came on a Sunday morning and it was quite busy. I ordered the breakfast burger. It sounded like exactly what I was in the mood for. A burger with egg and bacon on a bagel. When I asked them for mayo, they said they didn't have any which broke my heart because I LOVE mayo on my burgers. My husband got the breakfast burrito. It was stuffed with egg, cheese, corn, black beans, and sweet potatoes. It was yummy but dry. I had hoped for a sauce maybe inside it or a salsa? My friend got the chicken biscuit with an egg on top and it was divine! They serve your meal on a wooden cutting board which is a cute touch. I did wish that they had more condiments available."}
{"text":"Local Loaf has consistently good food with quality ingredients and an interesting menu. In particular, I recommend the \"Hot Italian\" or the \"Local Loaf Burger\". Service is surprisingly fast during lunchtime rushes and the 7th street public market is a nice place to hang around while you wait/eat."}
{"text":"Disappointed of his professional approach toward other business owners sharing the same space (7th PUBLIC Market). Extremely POOR taste in partnership and unitized communities. A bully doing business is absolutely unacceptable!! I have been in food business before and have been severely burnt by a bully businessman who escaped with murder, therefore I have NO tolerant for bullies in business, especially local.  Being selfish and aggressive isn't the best way for the business to adapt and grow."}
{"text":"Woah, consider me pretty blown away after one visit to Local Loaf. The Chicken & the Egg and the BLT were both incredible sandwiches.
I ordered the BLT, which comes with fried green tomatoes, bacon, popcorn shoots, and white pimento cheese. To call this sandwich a BLT is honestly a bit of a stretch, the star of the show was definitely the pimento cheese. The bacon was cooked perfectly- not super floppy but not overdone and crunchy either and the fried green tomatoes added a little crunch and good flavor. There were very few popcorn shoots, however, and with the tomatoes being fried it didn't really remind me of a BLT much. This doesn't mean the sandwich wasn't good though because the white pimento cheese was incredible. You could put it on 2 week old Wonder bread and still make a tasty sandwich.
As good as the BLT was, the chicken & the egg biscuit might have been even better! The biscuit was nice and fluffy, the cheddar added a nice dimension, and the poached egg was perfectly cooked and burst open as soon as my girlfriend cut into the sandwich. The best part by far though was the chicken. The chicken tenders were heavily spiced, but the chipotle Cheerwine sauce provided the perfect balance of sweet. I would order these tenders at just about any restaurant on their own; adding in the biscuit, cheese, and egg just made it incredible. 
The prices were very reasonable as well, especially for a farm to fork location with very high quality ingredients. My only complaint is that when I ordered I didn't mention sides for either sandwich and the cashier never asked, so my girlfriend and I assumed sides were extra and weren't worried about getting any. Instead we later realized we could've chosen between cucumber salad, chips, or soup ($1 more for soup) but instead were just given chips which neither of us really wanted. Overall, I can't complain much about this, I just wish the cashier had asked us our choice (or we had read the menu better haha)."}
{"text":"Great bread! I had the local dip. Classic french dip. My wife had the veggie sandwich and it was very very good! Great addition to 7th Street Market! Friendly service and great presentation of the sandwiches. Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Local Loaf has always looked delicious, but unfortunately their mediocre quality paired with a terrible service experience has ended my brief relationship with this restaurant.

I came to 7th street market for a work lunch with colleagues and was really disappointed by the service. I ordered a Falafel Burger, and my order came out as a Portabella Sandwich (not even a burger, not the same thing, not at all). I took the food back up to the register. They looked up my order number and sure enough, they confirmed that I had ordered a falafel burger. They had no explanation for the mix up but said that they would get my burger out to me \"within two minutes.\"

I sat back down with a new number. Ten minutes later, my burger comes out. Now, I can understand some mistakes, but they honestly did not seem to care at all that I had been given the wrong food and they definitely did not try to remedy the situation quickly. Excellent service would have been offering me a discount on my next visit, offering a side/dessert/other token,e tc. Mediocre would have been getting me my burger within two minutes. But this was just plain poor.

Also, the falafel burger really wasn't that good and really disappointing after my now 30 minutes wait for it. The cucumber salad was decent, though."}
{"text":"It's inside the market place. Opens early and has fresh food. I couldn't eat anything on the menu so I made my own order but the girl at the front looked mad and kept rolling her eyes... so rude. Other then tht my creation was delicious! I got two poached eggs (they don't do hard boiled ) on salad with sautéed mushrooms"}
{"text":"So of course I checked on yelp for suggestions before I came and basically everyone raved about the Chicken and the Egg so of course I ordered it and of course it was everything everyone said it was. 
It came out super fast and the presentation was very instagrammable. The egg is cooked perfectly and the yolk sinks into the biscuit when you cut into it and it was great. The chicken is crispy on the inside but tender on the inside and the melted cheese on top made it even better. The chipotle cheer wine sauce and the honey sauce gave it a sweet/salty dynamic. The only downside is that the biscuit was a bit hard and the dish was hard to eat in general without having stuff fall all over the plate (board?)
I ordered the cucumber salad on the side because I was trying to be healthy and it's not normally something I really enjoy eating but this tasted like fresh pickles but less pickle-y and more tangy - I highly recommend it.
It's also a giant portion for how much you're paying."}
{"text":"Awesome as always. Their steak and egg sandwich is absolutely dominate. The serve it with a cucumber salad which is also solid. You great get value for your dollar there as the sandwich is 10 bucks. You also get 15% off by checking in on here."}
{"text":"Great customer service--some of the best.

I'd pass on the Cuban, not the greatest... to be fair, I'm not a huge fan in the first place.  Cucumber salad wasn't what I expected... too much vinegar, and literally just cucumber--dress it up some with tomatoes, onions,etc. please!

dmo out."}
{"text":"The chicken & the egg is the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had. Seriously delicious. It's the only thing I've ever gotten here, but Local Loaf deserves 5 stars just for this sandwich alone. The biscuit, egg, chicken and sweet glaze all tie the flavors in really nicely. 

It's located in the 7th Street Public Market among some other small businesses. Best thing to do is park in the garage and you can bring your ticket to get validated."}
{"text":"I spend most of my days daydreaming about the hot steak sandwich. I've only tried that one sandwich at this shop, but if the other sandwiches are as delicious, tender and mouthwatering as the one I had, then this is probably the best sandwich shop in the city. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both meals were flawless. This small unassuming bakery is situated inside the 7th Street Public Market. My usual style is to try something different each time I visit a place like this so the fact that I've eaten at Local Loaf 2x (and still haven't tried that nice looking Italian place or the creperie) is significant. 

At Local Loaf you can order your food and have it served to you outside in a super casual environment making this an excellent stop after some time with your kiddos at Imaginon next door. 

The burgers at Local Loaf are some of the best around; fresh baked artisanal breads, very high quality meat, and creative toppings - paired with homemade chips - all blend together to create a mouth watering treat. 

But don't stop there. A few days ago we had the special sandwich...marinated pork belly cooked to perfection and garnished with small bits of chicharrones. This was served on a peanut butter bun...not a bun with peanut butter on it but a bun with PB cooked into it! Combined with this heavenly Sriracha cream sauce and lettuce it made for a very unique (and delicious) sandwich experience.

Staff at Local Loaf are very friendly and the facility is always clean and tidy. Plus, with prices this reasonable, t's not hard to become a repeat customer at Local Loaf."}
{"text":"Local loaf has great pastries and some of the best sandwiches in Charlotte.  My favorite pastry was the apricot Danish."}
{"text":"Got the chicken and the egg per the recommendation of the girl at the counter, it was one of the best sandwiches ive ever had. 5 stars. Its a mess of a sandwich but its incredible."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous, most wonderful food experience for brunch.  I am not a brunch fan, but let me tell you what, BLOWN AWAY.  I am up for brunch every Sunday now.  I could eat the chicken and egg breakfast sandwich every day and be happy.  So, it's crispy chicken tenders, micro greens (so cute), cheese, a biscuit, a perfectly poached egg, and cheerwine sauce!???  Yep...cheerwine sauce.  It was so delicious, I can't wait to have it again.  It comes with a side, I had the cucumbers and onions, which was pretty good as well.  

I recommend this place to anyone.  In fact I'm begging you to go delight in the luxury and delightfulness of this brunch treat.  You must have it.  I can't believe I waited so long."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious breakfast. I had the croque madame and a friend had the chicken and egg. Both were delicious and had generous portions. 

Staff is polite, friendly and courteous. I've always loved 7th Street and it might very well be my new favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"This place is not a restaurant, but a bunch of different food stands throughout. It's a cool place inside like cheese stands and Italian specialty shops and souveneirs. We ordered fro the local loaf and I got the Croque madame and Baldie got the waffles. I wasn't impressed with mine. Baldie liked the waffles because they had  real blueberries.We got coffee from the coffee stand and that was pretty good. Overall, cool place for a bite. I'll try the Italian stand next time and maybe the cheese stand."}
{"text":"Service - Friendly!

Food - Visually appealing, but average in taste.
1. Steak and Eggs - Steaks were a little overcooked. Eggs and jalapeno aioli were both overly rich.  Therefore, it needed some acidity.
2. Chicken & The Egg - Do get. Although the chicken tenders were a bit dry, the Cheerwine sauce was spectacular!"}
{"text":"Wow - I tried the chicken and the egg for lunch here. This sandwich was stacked on a biscuit and topped with some of the most delicious fried chicken in the world (not exaggerating). On the other side of the biscuit was a perfectly cooked fried egg. With a side of pickled cucumbers, which had just enough punch to be a refreshing taste alongside the heavy and savory sandwich, this was perfect. It was also reasonably priced for how enormous it is. It was kind of difficult to eat, but with a fork and knife I perservered. I barely was able to finish this thing, but don't worry...I made it."}
{"text":"Amazinnngggggg!!!! Finally got a chance to give this place another shot and I wasn't disappointed the food was awesome. There are so many good options to choose from I didn't know what to get but I decided on the chicken and biscuits and I couldn't have been more happy with my decision."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast wrap with a side of pickled cukes and onions which were delicious."}
{"text":"Food:  (5/5)  -  Local Loaf, obviously, bakes all kinds of fresh bread every day.  They better when they have the word \"loaf\" in their name, haha.  Sometimes, I don't even go there to order lunch.  I just get a few baguettes to-go and call it a day.  Other than the bread (which really is the backbone of every sandwich), they do a phenomenal job of creating fresh and unique sandwiches.  The Steak Sandwich is the one that really stands out for me.  Nice succulent cuts of beef, some sprouts, and perfect amount of homemade horseradish spread.  D...licious!  Oh yeah, homemade chips or cucumber salad with every sandwich, too!  They really do an excellent job of not over extending themselves and trying to create a crazy complex menu.  Sweet and simple - maybe ten things on there (bfast & lunch).

Atmosphere: (5/5) - It is located in the 7th Street Public Market in the corner nearest to the 7th street entrance.  This is a great location for socializing and a little shopping (see my 7th Street 5-star review).  

Overall, you can't go wrong and everything on the menu is repeatable.  Enjoy!!

-Ian M."}
{"text":"This is now one of my favorite brunch places in Charlotte. We got the Chicken & the Egg and the Croque Madame. Both were absolutely delicious and I can't wait to go back. The service was fast and brought to your table in the market. This was better than the sit down restaurants that try to do brunch."}
{"text":"My experiences here average out to about 3 stars..
5 stars for the times when they serve up the most delicious pancakes (banana-walnut and chocolate being my favorites) and... 0 stars for when they mess up orders, serve burnt pancakes, deny that they are burnt, and for the times when you have to wait in line for over 20 minutes just to place your order (which is most of the Time) but once your order is in, the food comes out pretty quickly, it's plated beautifully on their wooden board and more often than not, it tastes pretty good too. They bake fresh bread daily, and it's really cool to be able to see the bakers working right there, but there have been occasions when the sandwiches have been made with really hard / chewy bread. They need more people at the register taking orders, to speed up the order taking & payment process. I couldn't guarantee you would have a splendid experience if you ate here; it's hit or miss. Perhaps with time the food quality will get consistent and the service will get better."}
{"text":"A fun place to stop for a tasty brunch while visiting Charlotte. I love the location in 7th Street market.. I grabbed a latte at Not Just Coffee across the aisle-way and was able to explore a few shops in the back. The food was very good. I had the chicken & the egg and thought it was delicious. The Cheerwine sauce added a fun, local touch. I had the grits as a side, and they were okay. My boyfriend had the steak & egg sandwich. It was super yummy and very hearty. The only negative was it got very messy at the end.. Trying to take a bite without everything sliding off was a feat. He had the cucumber salad as a side and was pleased. I loved that everything was served on the stamped wooden boards. We went at 8:30 a.m. on a Sunday, and there were several empty tables. We had our food within 10 minutes. Prices were very reasonable, and we got 2 meals for less than $25. We also found lots of free parking as the meters are only enforced Monday-Friday, but they do validate for the garage next door. Definitely worth stopping in."}
{"text":"i had the chicken and biscuit entree. the chicken was cooked perfectly. not overly dry or undercooked. it was kind of messy to eat so i used a fork and knife. overall flavor was good and i paired it with the tangy cucumber salad. it was good balance between salty oily and fresh and tangy! only downfall they didn't have any water :( that day! service was great! i recommend u try it!"}
{"text":"The Chicken and the Egg was every bit as good as the Yelp reviews suggested it would be. Probably one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  It would be difficult to go there and order something else, but everything else coming out of that kitchen looked pretty terrific too.  Definitely worth a visit (and the surrounding market is pretty cool too)."}
{"text":"I was at Not Just Coffee during breakfast hours on a Sunday and saw everyone and their moms with some very tasty looking fried chicken and egg tray. I thought to myself that I had to try that out for myself, and sure enough the dish is called the chicken and the egg. Some 7 minutes later and a few sips of coffee, my order came and I was drooling. Fried chicken tenders with melted cheese and a poached egg, each over a biscuit and drizzled with syrup. Oh my goodness it was amazing! Like \"shut the front door and just let me stuff my face\" good. I decided to dig into the egg first but I'll let you choose which to eat first, the chicken or the egg. For $9 I couldn't have been happier. For sides, I would recommend the house made chips. They were tastier than the healthier cucumber option."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a Sunday afternoon, 7th street market was buzzing, and Local Loaf was the first place to catch my eye. After making a round and checking out what people were eating, I decided that this place looked the best. I ordered the Chicken & the Egg - hand breaded chicken tenders, white cheddar, poached egg, and microgreens on a southern buttermilk biscuit and topped with chipotle sauce. The dish itself looks so good, it's what initially caught my eye when I saw someone else in the marketplace eating it. I'm such a sucker for fried chicken so I was definitely in foodie heaven with this sammy."}
{"text":"Ice cold eggs,sausage gravy like glue. I asked for chicken tenders inside of bacon. Got weird pieces of poached chicken not fried tenders. It looked so good but very disappointed."}
{"text":"Three stars on price. Four stars for the food. FIVE STARS for the Chicken and the Egg breakfast!! 
Everything was perfectly prepared. Atmosphere was that of the European market."}
{"text":"the food wasn't bad, but it was priced too high and VERY hard to eat. I don't mind good, stick-to-your-bones food that is sloppy.... But this was not the case. They just put their food on a piece of wood, essentially, and half my fries had fallen off by the time i got to the table (they don't give you many to begin with). Their chicken-and-the-egg is also just very hard to eat and it kind of took away from the experience because all the ingredients were falling all over the place. Not great. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Limited menu a hard place to find using gps, parking can be a little hectic too! That being said The chicken and the egg was pretty decent. Fried chicken cutlets w poached egg w arugula on biscuit w cheer wine sauce. Served w house made chips that aren't that great."}
{"text":"This place has some very interesting options like the chicken and the egg.  Their product usually doesn't disappoint. However they mess up orders frequently and can be somewhat inconsistent."}
{"text":"Located in 7th street market, local loaf might be my favorite cheat meal muffin place in the city. Of course, muffins ain't all they do.

They also make breakfast staples like egg sandwiches, pancakes (they have a red velvet pancake right now that looks magnifique), and other morning time delectables. Their decor evokes a modern workmanlike bakery, and this is reflected in the quality of their fare. I had a butterscotch white chocolate muffin that I saved for later.  2 hours later when I ate it  (with cold brew because, yes, I am that guy) it was still bakery fresh. 

I recommend asking for the social of the day. They sometimes have 2 choices, and you can't really go wrong with a muffin... You know,  on cheat day..."}
{"text":"How have I yet to review this place?!?!  I guess as often as I've been, I just assumed I had!

Nestled in the corner of 7th Street Public Market is where you'll find Local Loaf.  Towers of fresh baked bread await behind the counter.  Muffins, croissants, and more await you in the glass case.  The chalkboard menu boasts a variety of breakfast and lunch options with daily specials peppered in.  

Wanna build your own omelet?  They've got you covered with a bountiful list of potential ingredients.  Fluffy pancakes more your fancy?  They do that too!  Brioche french toast?  Yea, baby!  Eggs with bacon and toast?  Over easy?  Over medium?  Over hard?  Sunny side up?  Yes, yes, yes, and yes!  Can you tell I've frequented this place more for breakfast?  Though I can assure you, the lunch options are equally enticing. 

The staff is quite friendly, and most now know me by name.  Adam, the founder, is always busy in the kitchen.  He works hard to keep the menu fresh, making periodic changes.  When you go, you'll place your order at the counter and you'll then be provided with a number to place at your table, or wherever you chose to sit throughout the market.  The ingredients used to prepare your entrees are fresh and local, and you can taste it with every bite.  If you like what you taste, chances are it's available for purchase right there in the market.

So what are you waiting for?  If your answer isn't breakfast, go get your loaf on!"}
{"text":"I must say that in addition to the baguettes (still amazing), I've sampled a few other items at Local Loaf and I love them all.

- Veggie Sandwich. It brings tears to my eyes, it's so good. A super thoughtfully constructed vegetarian offering that is worth its weight in gold. 

- Croque Monsieur sans ham. The béchamel sauce along sets this sandwich apart from the rest. Perfectly seasoned and mouth-wateringly tempting. You won't be sorry if you order this one.

- Blueberry peach pancakes. I must confess that I didn't even touch the syrup served with these bad boys. Didn't need it. They were really moist, and the sweetness of the peaches paired with the fresh blueberries made my breakfast just exactly what I had hoped for."}
{"text":"Three Egg Omelet was extremely tasty. Loved the cheese and veggies. There was actually so much that I almost wish it was a four egg omelet!

The toast was freshly baked of course, and delish! I thought the employees were very friendly, and I loved the presentation of the food on the flat board. All around win!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusted to hear of the harassment that the owner of this establishment has caused to other local business owners.  I will never endorse a business that uses bullying and threats of violence to try and manipulate others. Unacceptable and intolerable.  Check out Gateau Baking Co's website to find out more about why Local Loaf should be banned from 7th Street Market."}
{"text":"I'm still unsure about Local Loaf. The logistics of every food item I've ever got there have been less than desirable. Just really messy--difficult to eat food. Don't get me wrong, the taste is there on pretty much everything. The only thing I haven't liked were the grits...something strange in the taste, almost perfumey. 

Location is perfect, I love 7th Street Market.

Service is always friendly and helpful--they always offer suggestions and answer questions.

I love that breakfast is available all day. 

It just hasn't been a homerun hit for me, but I'll keep going back to get it there!"}
{"text":"We have been here three times and one thing remains consistent... The bread here is fabulous. I recommend any of the breakfast items as the plates are large and delicious. The side of chips are a perfect combination of crispness and saltiness. 

We will be back here for a change-up of the usual, mundane Panera. The only downside is the seating at the 7th Street Market."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I got the \"chicken and the egg\" and my girlfriend got an omelette. Absolutely amazing food, and it came out fast. The guy who helped us was great. Very kind, talked us through all of our questions (it was our first time at the market), and checked up on us during our meal. Would love to go back. Best breakfast I've had in Charlotte so far."}
{"text":"So I'm all about the 7th Street Station Market.  Local Loaf makes a good \"anchor\" restaurant as far as breakfast and lunch options.  Now that my office has moved away from the center of town... 7thSS is probably the closest walk, without making lunch too terrible a hike.  I haven't had a breakfast here I haven't devoured in 5 min because it's so good.  The atmosphere in the weekday mornings is super relaxed and the folks here are friendly and get you your food quickly.

My favorite is the Chef's Waffles.  Since it's the chef's waffle flavor of the week... almost like roulette, but the outcome is great every time!  It comes with eggs and bacon.

Sandwiches and burgers are also on the menu.  Most (if not all food) is served on wooden cutting boards and you get plastic cutlery.  Oh yeah... they do have salads here too... but life is too short for salads... j/k.  Just make sure your salad has a side of burger!

Being next to the Lynx Station makes this a perfect way to start my day before hiking to the office.  If you drive in, the parking can be validated (with proof of purchase) here or at one of the other vendors.  It used to be honor system but some people took advantage and didn't help with small business (shakes head here)."}
{"text":"The good:
The food, the staff, the prices, the happiness at the end when you're full

The bad: nothing. Really good place, just go before or after the business rush to avoid the crowds.  The chicken biscuit is Divine"}
{"text":"The Chicken and the Egg was fantastic.  They give you a big serving of chicken fingers over two biscuits with an egg.  Pure heaven!   Got the chips with it 

The real win though was the biscuits and gravy.  The gravy is a bit spicy and frankly the best gravy I have ever have with the biscuits.  It's a great biscuit too.  The line gets long and this is one of many good stops in the market.  However, there can't be a better breakfast stop in the whole market."}
{"text":"When I think of 7th Street public market I think of Local Loaf. This place is amazing. The chicken and the egg is my all time favorite. And their biscuits are so good! I also highly recommend the Cuban."}
{"text":"I finally came to 7th Street for lunch and managed to tear myself away from Pure Pizza to order food from another vendor.  I got a Local Dip sandwich with a side of chicken noodle soup and it was nice to have the option of soup as a side on a chilly day.

First off, any of their sandwiches will get a big head start because of the quality of the bread they are served on.  The Dip was on a baguette which was a perfect blend of crispy and chewy and was toasted in some garlic butter.  The meat on the sandwich is pot roast braised in a red wine sauce.  Caramelized onions are added and some local cheese is melted on top.  The sandwich is served with some yummy jus for dipping.  The only downer on this visit was that the very first bite was a big hunk of fat which had me deconstruct the sandwich to eat with some more inspection involved.  That was the only sandwich misstep however as the flavors were very good and hearty.

The side of soup was OK but not outstanding as it tended to have an onion flavor that overwhelmed the chicken.  It did take the chill off the day though so I gobbled it up!

After ordering at the counter and being given a number, the food came out quickly which is a real plus during lunch."}
{"text":"Chicken and the egg. The chicken is so juicy and the white cheddar and cheerwine sauce are a perfect compliment"}
