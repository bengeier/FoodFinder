{"text":"Pretty awesome place and about as authentic-Madison as it gets. You can expect lines at this place and it is slightly cramped but those are basically the only gripes.

The food is awesome, from the giant pancakes to the scrambler (omelette piled high with chedder cheese and gravy). There are several different pancakes (regular, cornmeal, blueberry, strawberry, etc.) and they are big. Almost an inch THICK. It's $5-$6 for 2 pancakes and one is generally enough.

Cash only. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Mickies Dairy Bar is not healthy, the portions are enormous, and you are given an incredible amount to choose from for breakfast. Mickies gets a four for all the Saturdays my family came here and grabbed a booth early in the morning. Chocolate shakes aren't the same when they aren't served in a huge tin cup and finally I am to the size where I can actually finish a scrambler. If you go to Mickies make sure you go when you've got plenty of time, because you are going to need it for all the food. There is often a wait also."}
{"text":"Friendly, authentic breakfast spot conveniently located next to the Hotel Red where I was staying. The service was fast, the coffee decent, and the food excellent.

These guys know how to do breakfast."}
{"text":"Mickies did not live up the hype. It was busy and crowded so I expected the best, but unfortunately ended up with food poisoning from doughy and uncooked tasting pancakes.  Even the toast was limp and subpar.  The service was fine but I will not be going back for any of their food."}
{"text":"Three little words (On my God!)came out of our mouths when we saw the size of the pancakes on our plates. One plate was enough to feed an army. Of course, we didn't know it when we ordered so we ordered  three for our family. The pancakes were better than IHOP or other pancake places but I still think mine are better. :=). I like it that it is not a chain restaurant and you are supporting locals. But it wasn't a spectacular. 
We heard good things about their pancakes so that's what we ordered but next time we go, we might order different thing just to try it out."}
{"text":"I would give it three and a half stars if I could.

This place is just a step up from Waffle House (the original hangover joint). The food is what you would expect from the price, solid but nothing fancy. It also probably tastes a whole lot better when you are hungover, and I was not hungover. 

I will probably go back, but not when I want to do brunch the right way.

I got the blueberry pancakes, and they were huge and average tasting. I also tried the scrambler (I think that's what it was called...eggs on potatoes), and it was pretty heavy. (As a side note, I had no clue what \"yanks\" were. They are potatoes, apparently.)

Overall, this place gets 4 instead of 3 stars because Waffle House holds a special place in my heart, and there aren't any of those around here."}
{"text":"The pancakes tasted like raw flour.  I couldn't really eat them because they were awful.  So I ordered some coffee cake, which was good, but nothing special.  We also had the scrambler.  I can't figure out why it was bad.  I mean it was okay.  Just very disappointing.  An bacon and cheese omelet on home fries.  I mean, eggs are eggs, right?  Cheese is cheese?  Home fries are home fries.  So I'm going to guess we just weren't in the mood for that type of food.  

 I kind of feel like a moron for actually criticizing greasy spoon quality food.  It's all basically the same unhealthy crap, right?"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant in Madison. It's a great old-fashioned restaurant, perfect for breakfast or brunch (I haven't been there for lunch or dinner). The food and service are great, and the prices are even better. If you go to breakfast on weekends, make sure to get there early. Also, they only take cash."}
{"text":"I confess I've never had anything but breakfast at Mickies, but everytime I'm in town I eat there each morning.  Sometimes I adjust travel to Monday, the only day they're closed. Nothing fancy just excellent omelets, any ingredient you can imagine (my favorite omelet is sauerkraut and swiss cheese), and the Yanks are the best breakfast potatoes anywhere, especially, with melted cheddar and Jalape√±os. Be forewarned, after a breakfast at Mickies all you'll want to do is go back to bed."}
{"text":"The pancakes are the best American pancakes I've ever had! Chocolate chips in the pancakes are gooey and warm. The blueberries are a healthy but tasty alternative. They size of the pancakes are enormous! The only problem is the long line and the early closing time. I wish I could have tried more items, but the place was too busy. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Warning: cash only; seat yourself
Pros: large portions, reasonable price, nice waiters
Cons: long wait, stressful seating process

Walking into Mickies Dairy Bar without knowing anything about it can be quite daunting. On a weekend morning, the place is packed. There is a small sign at the front that informs people to seat themselves, but it's a little stressful. Unless you were born with the ability to determine when people are going to leave a table, you may find yourself a little anxious to get a table.

Once seated though, that stress dissipates and is replaced by good, hearty food. The scramble is delicious. It's also quite large. My friend and I split a cinnamon roll, a milkshake, and the scramble, and we were perfectly satisfied with the amount of food. The cinnamon roll doesn't look that appealing, but it's tasty. The milkshake comes with an extra cup-full, so it's great to share (or imbibe alone). The scramble is amazing. It's the perfect hangover/comfort food option. Eggs, cheese, meat, potatoes, and whatever else you want mixed together and served on a giant plate. 

My friend got their chocolate chip pancakes and was pretty disappointed in them. They weren't soft and moist, and without syrup, it was difficult to eat much of it.

This place is a staple of Madison, so I recommend trying it at least once. I would suggest coming here in small groups, as the seating is limited during the most popular hours. Also, don't forget to bring cash!"}
{"text":"Very generous serving of American breakfast to start you day. They have almost everything classic. I went with a group and so had tried pancakes, omelette, potatoes and toast. Pair that with a milkshake, if it's not too early for one. You can split the milkshake with a friend (although they might charge extra for that, I don't remember).

They get pretty busy during the weekends. Definitely go early if you want to avoid the crowds. Their system took a little getting used to for me, you just walk in and take a seat wherever available. For that reason, you will usually find yourself sharing a table with people you don't know, unless you are lucky enough to get one of the few booths. 

For me personally I don't think the wait is worth it. Their menu items do not wow me enough, in the sense that these are just classic breakfast items. Nothing that can't be easily gotten elsewhere where you don't have to wait for a table. So I will stop by if I wake up early enough (usually never on weekends), and if I happen to be in the area.

Oh, and if you decide to brave the morning crowd, do bring cash since it's a cash only place. And get a hearty meal to start you day."}
{"text":"Mickie's Dairy Bar is maybe one of the most disgusting and vile places I have ever eaten. I have been to Mickie's once on a Sat. morning. I ordered a large orange juice and one blueberry pancake. The pancake was burnt on one-side and underdone on the other. The garnish (a chintzy orange twist and parsley sprig; who has ever hear of a parsley garnish for a pancake?) had not one, but two fruit flies on it. The orange juice had ice in it, making it watered down. The service was terrible, seeing how none of the waiters were under the age of 50. Needless to say I will never, ever in my life go back again. Not even if someone paid me."}
{"text":"A Madison breakfast classic - the one place I will get up entirely-too-early to go to. This place gets REALLY busy mid-morning on the weekends, and don't plan on being able to get a table here before a football game in the fall. But, it's worth the wait and jockeying for seats with the other waiting patrons.

The pancakes are great! One is more than enough, even for those with a healthy appetite... yet, somehow, I always get talked into ordering two. They're pretty delicious heated up the next morning, too!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice waitstaff, huge portions. Can anything bad be said about a restaurant that brings your coffee cake before yor meal. Nice and warm, and e seasonal strawberry rhubarb is to die for."}
{"text":"This place is like family, as is everything in Madison. A must stop on game day. (Football, Basketball, Hockey, etc..) The largest portions you have ever seen anywhere in the state. Also has one of the most fun atmospheres in the city. I have been going there from childhood."}
{"text":"I can't give it five stars because it's too small, and too long to wait a LOT of the time.  Forget homegames, don't show up on Saturday or Sunday mornings unless you want to wait.  I'm tellin you though, it's so much food for such a reasonable price that you feel it 24 hours later.  Not for the faint of heart, or soft of stomach.  Be prepared, be very prepared because you will spend the rest of your day curled up on the couch cursing your misfortune of having eaten all of the scrambler.  Also, they might have the best shakes in Madison (ice cream, not post stuffing yourself seizures)."}
{"text":"Went there with high expectations because it was featured on ESPN during college football season last year.  They do give huge portions.  However, my taste bud could not tell what they served any different from Denny's or IHOP. I think it just has the advantage of being located right across from the football stadium."}
{"text":"The Scrambler
A layer of hash browns, a layer of your choice of filling, eggs and cheese. It's enough to feed an army. You have a choice of toast and gravy (unnecessary in my opinion). It's an intimidating plate full of food. I usually cut it down the middle and take half home. It's fantastic.

{"text":"This place has amazing breakfast!! However if your a health nut or un any way watching your weight or heart this place is defiantly not for you!! I always get dessert after my HUGE breakfast! At least a milkshake"}
{"text":"For a classic diner feel, Mickeys delivers. It's not gourmet food, it's not too creative, there are no frills: but the food tastes good, the coffee is cheap and endless, and you feel like you are taking a step into the past when you enter. 

I'd advise visiting on a weekday or before 9:00 on a weekday lest you have to wait a considerable amount of time. I'm not sure it's worthy of a wait, but it is worth a visit if they aren't swamped. 

I'm a fan of their pancakes. As some have mentioned, they are not light and fluffy, but they are delicious and relatively sweet on their own without syrup. My favorites are the Griddle cakes (a cinnamony, raisin filled dense cake that doesn't even need syrup) and the cornmeal (savory with a rich taste and hint of sweetness). The serving sizes are gigantic, so you can definitely bank on getting stuffed. 

Service is pretty friendly-- cash only, so be forewarned. Also, they will usually let you mix and match pancake flavors, which is a plus in my book: you get to try more!"}
{"text":"This place is always filled with people. Go early to avoid having to wait in long line especially on game days. I really recommend their pancakes and milkshakes. The other dishes are very cheese based for example their scrambler are basically eggs and tons of cheese. The food portion here is huge and the price is quite cheap. Service is pretty fast and friendly"}
{"text":"Four stars for Mickies just being what it sets out to be - a dairy bar. Not sure what more I can add to the sentiments shared already, but you really should fast for a day or two before heading to Mickies. And just resist getting a side of something because your entree is going to kick your ass several times over. Sure, pancakes (with fake maple syrup...this ain't vermont), home fries and a shake seems doable when you're looking at the menu and the still-very -low prices. But each pancake is the size of the plate, and turns to a well-what-we're-you-expecting tower of curing cement once it's buttered and syruped up. A word to the wise: get the short stack. And of course your milkshake is accompanied by the metal mixing cup so you have a refill at the ready should you not go into lactose shock too soon. Truly one of Madison's gems."}
{"text":"A couple of suggestions.  First, get there early.  The place fill up fast and there isn't much room to wait.  Second, come hungry and bring cash.  The servings are enormous and the food is very reasonable.  My daughter got 1 pancake, which was the size of a dinner plate.  I got the scrambler, which was taller than 4 slices of toast.  The food was delicious and very filling.  The service was fast and spot on.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"The eggs were brown, the coffee was weak, and the hashbrown potatoes were a bit flavorless from being overcooked... that being said, I totally get why people love this place! I got two eggs over medium with toast, bacon, and hashbrowns (my standard for judging any breakfast establishment), and my boyfriend got the ham scrambler with gravy on top (he's a sucker for gravy.. what can I say?). We managed to find two seats at the end of the counter on a busy Saturday morning. Service was quick and our waitress was so attentive.. our water glasses were never empty and she was happy to give me a styrofoam coffee cup and she even topped me up on the way out! This place is straight out of the 1950s from the cramped space to the way the order tickets get sent to the line. The food was relatively inexpensive ($7 for each of our meals that stuck to our bones for the better part of the day.. and we have hearty appetites!) and was definitely satisfying. Like some reviewers have mentioned before me: don't make this place something it isn't! Also, I mentioned that my potatoes were a bit flavorless, but when I took a bite of my guy's scrambler, it all came together! They need the gravy and cheese for sure. If you're new to Madison or just visiting, this is a classic establishment that you really should check out!"}
{"text":"Rating: 3.0
Short description: Dinner style breakfast
Pluses: Lots of food, very inexpensive, good cinnamon rolls
Negatives: Huge wait, cash only, last time I was there they messed three things up on my meal such as steak was overcooked, eggs were the wrong kind, and I got the wrong toast type.
Recommendations: Try it once.  Otherwise, take the drive to Kenosha and go to Frank's Diner instead."}
{"text":"I always go for the scrambler,milk shakes, and coffee for Sunday brunch.  Really cozy diner which is unique to Madison."}
{"text":"Come hungry and expect a wait. My family and I went last Sunday around 1pm and there was still a line out the door. Worth the wait though! My husband and I ordered the skillet platters, they were HUGE and delicious! Country style potatoes with & onion, bacon and then topped with 3 eggs and a heaping pile of cheese to boot. My boys ordered shakes, burgers & cheese curds, everything was great. Granted, we could have been rolled out of there but it was a fun splurge. Old school through & through!"}
{"text":"My best friend brought me here one morning while I was visiting her in Madison- we basically stuffed ourselves silly. She ordered the scrambler and I ordered chocolate pancakes. We both got milkshakes with her breakfast because which were delicious and thick. We arrived early before a rush and could see the line going up the street for people waiting to eat. Definitely want to visit again. The staff was friendly and helpful. Cash only too FYI."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was midday on a Wednesday to avoid their notoriously long wait. There were just a handful of people there when we walked in and we got seated by the window.
The inside is very true to the theme- lots of old time-y decorations and they have the original menu up on the wall too for comparison.
Since it was my first time at Mickey's I had to get the Scrambler - for those few who have yet to try one, you get to choose your fillings and a cheese and it comes on top of a mound of potatoes with gravy. I decided on broccoli with pepper jack cheese.
My dining companion decided on the Reuben omelet based on a recommendation by our server and got cheese and onions on the yanks (potatoes). It was a really interesting combination of flavors for an omelette but it all worked together really well!
The portion sizes are HUGE- at least two if not three to four meals worth of food.
Their coffee was surprisingly very tasty - much better than typical unlimited diner coffee.
We also couldn't leave without trying one of their shakes -we got the malted chocolate shake and it was delicious (as expected). They also were super nice and gave us the excess shake since we were sharing."}
{"text":"A fifty year old american dairy bar owned by a republican Thai man who blasts country music at five o'clock in the morning. The best boss I ever had. The prices are as low as the portions are huge.  Payow's weekday only lunch specials and homemade soups are well kept secrets.  The scrambler is not a well kept secret.  Highly recommended by Lyle Lovett."}
{"text":"What a classic restaurant! This is the place to have breakfast/brunch in Madison. Honestly, you cannot come to Madison without coming here! Their scrambler is everything. Just order it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Fun and Funky!! Huge portions! Right social setting! Good food at lower prices! Love this place! Especially before a Badger function!"}
{"text":"Mickies, a Madison institution. Had to try it, glad I did, even happier that I won't have to again. Now, I will say that I am not a big fan of piles of breakfast foods covered in gravy, but their's was certainly nothing special. I got the Scrambler because that is what you get when you go to Mickies. It was good not great. The coffee was decent, the atmosphere was existent, all was satisfactory. 

I am told that this place is packed most days and that on game days (like the day I attended) it has an hour plus wait. If I had waited even 10 minutes to sit down this place would have only gotten 2 stars. Just saying.  All in all it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"My last day in madison, so I decided to have brunch at mickeys. Corned beef hash was good, steak had no seasoning, portions were WAY to big.  Staff was friendly however I spent the evening with food poisoning. Just writing this review makes me nauseous .....I will never go back!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Be warned.... must bring cash!!! But don't worry there is an atm right outside. Parking was a bit of a pain. If you find a spot. Park and walk there. Otherwise you'll be circling.

The portions are huge!!!! We had leftovers. Really this was a bang for your buck. Our waiter was not quite awake yet but did an awesome job. Friendly people. One note is the menu is on the wall and it's seat yourself. Enjoy that American diner feel with most dishes for breakfast at least under $10. Classic."}
{"text":"Take home message: DO NOT eat here if you have any type of dietary restriction whatsoever (including restrictions related to your religion, allergies, or being vegetarian, vegan, or needing to eat gluten-free) unless you want to eat a plain salad, a beverage, or a cinnamon roll.

This past Saturday, I went for the 2nd time to Mickies, expecting good food and fine service as I had experienced the 1st time. Instead, to sum up the experience I had on Saturday, it was terrible.

I went with 3 other friends. Two of us have food restrictions (I'm a strict vegetarian and she doesn't eat pork for religious reasons). 

Here's what happened:
1. A friend, who doesn't have any food restrictions, asked about the ingredients that go into the scrambler. Our waitress said \"the list is up there; those are your options.\" My friend again asked what they were, and mentioned she couldn't see the list well (we were seated in a position that makes the list difficult to see). The waitress said impatiently and condescendingly, \"I told you, they are listed up there. Any vegetable you can think of ok? So what do you want in it.\" That was off-putting but what happened next I couldn't believe...

2. My friend, who does not eat pork, also wanted a scrambler, but without the gravy. She asked if it would be cooked on the same grill where all the meat is cooked. Apparently it is, so she asked if it would be possible to have it cooked on a different grill than where the meat is cooked (this is something I personally know is done in many establishments for people with dietary restrictions). The waitress asked \"Well why? Is this like some sort of a uh...religious thing or...something?\" Why pry and try to find out if her reason for not eating pork is valid enough for you? Inappropriate. Absolutely unacceptable. My friend nodded, but just did not want to get into things with her. Why should she have to explain herself and validate her reasoning to a stranger? So she just said \"well, it's an allergy thing.\" The waitress responded, shaking her head \"no\" condescendingly, \"well, I can ask, but we don't do that here. We got 2 grills and that's it. It's a small place. So you still want it?\" We were all appalled at how she was acting toward my friend, and my friend just ordered a cinnamon roll and orange juice.

3. Next up to order was me. I'm a strict vegetarian and would always strongly prefer that my food be cooked where meat remnants wouldn't be. However, I was so frustrated with how she was speaking to my friends that I just ordered an omelette and moved on.

4. After she left with our orders, it occurred to me that many establishments that I've visited offer to clean off their grills before making a specific kind of dish for someone with dietary restrictions. So, after making my friend feel badly about having a dietary restriction, when she came around our table again, I asked her if it would be possible to just clean off the grill before making a meal. This apparently tipped this waitress over. She said \"look, we're very busy here and don't have that kind of time. It would take over 10 minutes just to clean it and we are not going to do that.\" (NOTE: I've been here before; it was past 1pm and wasn't that busy anymore; there were empty seats and tables by this point). She walked off. Then immediately came back and said \"Hey, I've been doing this a long time; that's just the kind of thing you'll run into when you are requesting that.\" My friend gently said \"well, I've actually eaten at [I don't wish to name the place she named here] just recently, and they just offered to easily clean off the grill before making my meal.\" The waitress shot back, with a huge attitude, with her neck rolling and her pointer finger up in the air, \"well you know I'm glad they have time for that and did that for you, but we don't here. Ok? Besides (looking at me), yours is probably already on the grill anyway.\" And she walked off. She came back with my friend's cinnamon roll and orange juice, didn't say a word, but slammed them both on the table in front of her and walked off. Seriously? Because she asked about accommodating dietary restrictions? 

People like her are disappointing. Establishments that refuse to make any accommodations to customers with dietary restrictions are disappointing. 

I'm not eating here again. And I will continue to share this story with anyone I know who has eaten or plans to eat at Mickies."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in Madison. Great remedy for a hangover. I've only had the pancakes and hashbrowns, and they are great. I've heard the shakes are legendary. Fun old-school ambience, very affordable place. My only qualm is that it is a pretty small joint so you might have to waiting awhile for a place to sit."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was amazing. Came in at first opening and had the Scrambler with bacon. Absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity the finally go to Mickie's dairy bar.
Wow what a place! Love the diner atmosphere,eating at the counter close quarters, the buzz of the customers enjoying their delicious food. To those who have been dining there for decades or even weeks, this is nothing new.  But for me a first time customer....Wow
Great atmosphere,great food and great people.
Going to eat there often."}
{"text":"Had a dream last night about their homemade strawberry rhubarb coffee cake...  And strong coffee too!"}
{"text":"By the time my son and I got here I'd already run 5 miles and was starving.  The omelet (size alone) was mind-blowing.  Their potatoes, which they called some weird name that is currently escaping me, were even better.  Coffee was good, hot, and magically refilled.

We sat at the bar, great for people-watching because you're up higher.  

I'm not usually one to enjoy dessert after breakfast, but you really can't pass up their milkshakes.  Remember - everything in moderation, including moderation."}
{"text":"Un diner pour le petit d√©j comme on en voit dans les films. Et en plus c'est bon et copieux. Et pas cher.
Peut √™tre le pan cakes √©taient un peu p√¢teux, mais ils √©taient bons, l'omelette l'√©tait √©galement (bonne, pas p√¢teuse).
Le service est cool, le cadre est tr√®s sympa.
C'est un diner populaires √† tous les sens du terme. la client√®le est vari√©e mais plut√¥t √©tudiants (on est √† Madison!), travailleurs et habitu√©s \"du quartier\"
Une adresse tr√®s sympa."}
{"text":"Old school, cash only diner. 

Be ready for huge, hearty meals and take-away containers. Great place to take a date/share a plate.

I dream of yanks. Best breakfast potatoes ever! 

You must try a scrambler, don't be nervous. You can choose toppings, get gravy on the side, and the staff is ready with to-go boxes.

Kick your milkshake up a notch by making it a malt. It will be the best you've had. After sampling the original flavors, go bold and have a butterscotch malt. It will knock your socks off! 

Blueberry pancakes (and all others) come in pairs and are so thick, most people cannot finish one. 

French toast is made old school. Four slices of heaven, covered in egg, waiting to be devoured. After over a decade of dining here, I haven't ever tried lunch or dinner.  My friends have assured me there is no bad plate at MDB. 

Crowded on weekends from about 10-1:30. Wait isn't usually too terrible and always worth it.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been traveling to Madison for sometime and wanted to stop at Mickies and today was the day. Great feel of an original diner, real friendly staff and a daily special ham and cheese omelet, American fries, toast and coffee for under 7 bucks. WOW

It sure is worth trying to find a nearby parking space, cash only to eat here at Mickies. My hats off to a restaurant that can combine reasonably priced good food and excellent service in this day and age. You made my day!

Continued Success for a long future."}
{"text":"Just had spectacular mid morning breakfast, Scrambler! Shared it with my daughter who is checking out campus. We got blueberry crumb cake to go bc we didn't have room for more. My favorite things were our very friendly waitress and that we didn't smell like breakfast when we left! Great ventilation!"}
{"text":"First, I would recommend knowing the right time(s) to come here. I've been here approximately once every week for about 5 months now, and I highly suggest coming during a weekday lunch. For those who do want the weekend brunch thing but do not want to endure the wait, call ahead and get takeout. I'd say sacrificing the dining experience in this regard is well worth the good food.

Now Mickie's is straight up no fuss breakfast food, and that is a philosophy that champions well. On a given day, I am by no means a \"fancy\" breakfast food person, so I welcome Mickie's philosophy with open arms. The essential Mickie's item that is a must try is of course their scrambler, which is a heaping omelette on top of a heaping pile of the most fluffy, buttermilk potatoes (yanks) you will ever eat. Oh, and it comes with a mountain of gravy and toast as well. The scrambler is definitely a multi-meal endeavor, and for $7-8, it is definitely worth the price. Pancakes are also a good choice, but keep in mind these aren't the traditional stack you would get at an i-Hop. These are gargantuan in diameter and are more dense than what you would normally expect. For $6, this is again a multi-meal endeavor. You can get tired of it quick though, so I personally recommend the more savory items.


Now there will be customers who see the food here as too generic and too simple, but keep in mind that it is not execute simple things easily, especially when it comes to food, so take these criticisms with a grain of salt, and realize that after all is said and done, Mickie's is one of the best places in town."}
{"text":"I am a regular at this place.  I have eaten there at least once a week for 10 years.
I have noticed that the service is getting worse and worse.  I always sit at the counter and you would expect that someone woulkd notice me.  Lately I have to ask other servers who are standing 2 feet away drinking coffee if someone could please just wait on me.  This is ridiculous.  I know some of the servers are new but still this is a basic restaurant skill.  I like the food OK and always leave a generous tip even if I have been ignored.  I think this institution is getting just too jaded to really care anymore."}
{"text":"Great burgers, cheap beer, friendly staff, and a relaxed dive-ish atmosphere.  What else could you want?"}
{"text":"I haven't lived in Madison for 10 years, but I still fantasize about the Scrambler and the blueberry pancakes.  I lived at the Regent and this is where I'd sober up after a night out or fuel up after a row.  

Your best bet is to get there early.  You'll want to stand over tables like a hawk, gawking at the patrons as if to say \"Come on, finish that last bite and get out of here so I can have your table.\"  Actually make them feel uncomfortable.  They will leave.  You will eat.  All will be well.

My first time at Mickey's I learned about the pancakes from an Indiana fan.  He was there for an away football game.  He ordered pancakes and put them into plastic ziplocks to bring back to Indiana for his wife.  Yes, they are that good."}
{"text":"This place gets very busy during peak hours, but it is 100% worth the wait.  I highly recommend building a scrambler or trying their blueberry pancakes.  Prices are incredibly reasonable.  Truly a landmark of Madison.  Just be aware that they only take cash."}
{"text":"It's so simple, or so it seems... but it's amazing how many people manage to screw up eggs, meat, potatoes, pancakes, french toast, and the rest of the breakfast experience. For what it serves, Mickies Dairy Bar does it perfectly... every single time."}
{"text":"To say the Scrambler is a lot of food is an understatement.  A plate stacked high with potatoes, eggs, cheese and your choice of meats and veggies.  My wife had the Reuben Omelet and a friend had pancakes (the size of the plate and an inch thick).  All were delicious.  The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 5 is the dive-like atmosphere, but that is part of its character on a college campus."}
{"text":"Mickies is such a great place to go for breakfast, or lunch, or a snack, whichever you prefer.  Their pancakes are GINORMOUS, and for less than $10, what a steal!!! Their pancakes are about 8 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick.  You'll probably be full with just one pancake.  The pancakes are really fluffy.  I also love their corned beef hash. It's four dollars for a \"dinner-sized plate\" full of corned beef hash.  What a steal!!! The has also has the right amount of salt and flavor.  For a great price, you are going to get a fantastic breakfast! I've also had their milkshakes, which are really tasty, but not as smooth as I'd like it to be.  At least my experience with their coffee milkshake was that it was a little more icy."}
{"text":"Thanks to our FL neighbor, a Wi Native, we came! Just the ambiance itself is worth the stop. Love the 1950's signs & prices ;) I'm doing a (Thank God! It's HUGE) Banana Nut Pancake, my husband got the Egg & Pork Chop special...no way we finished either of them. The pancake was enormous with an abundance of nuts & banana slices. His pork chops (2) were tender & delicious. Why would college students sign up for the meal plan? Their folks should just send them here! Lots of character - even the ladies room. This is a must-do WI spot (after finding all the FLW structures)"}

{"text":"its okay, butit is \"a Madison institution\".  Three of our 4 pancakes were undercooked and doughy. My scrambled eggs were thin and flat. The toast and jelly had no flavor, andsausage was nothing special. The potatoes were good, and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Madison has far better options for a basic, big portion breakfast.  It's fine  if you want to relive the hangover breakfasts of your college days but not so good if your main goal is a really tasty breakfast."}
{"text":"Went here on March 24 in the morning. Had the blueberry coffee cake, blue berry pancakes and a scramble with gravy. Portions are super big. Would definitely recommend going there. Best blueberry coffee cake with lots of blueberries"}
{"text":"I've gotta say, after reading the reviews I went in expecting a good quality, greasy spoon type of meal.  The wait was short and the place was packed.  The staff was efficient and very friendly.  

The food however left something to be desired.  The pancakes, while properly cooked and of good size were flavorless to a point they were not to be helped by the poor quality maple-ish syrup.  The potatoes were...  well...  potatoes, unseasoned, nothing special.  They have some fun combinations for their omelets but anything stuffed with corned beef, sauerkraut and thousand island dressing is going to taste good.  We did have a malt on the side which was under-malted and over milked.  

I cannot understand why the place is so popular with a Madison crowd usually so sophisticated in its tastes.  The place really has nothing special to offer.  Maybe it's due to the fact when you're hung over on Saturday morning you just can't tell how mediocre it is.  If you changed the name and moved it to a different part of town It wouldn't last more than a few months.

I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"A classic Madison staple on football weekends, Mickie's never fails to fill you up with starchy goodness in the form of pancakes, scramblers, and endless coffee. Don't come to Mickie's expecting five-star cuisine, but do expect a historic diner vibe connecting yourself to Camp Randall and Badger traditions. 

I've been a handful of times to Mickie's during undergrad, having tried the scramblers and pancakes which are pretty heavy in your stomach and great for the price, but today I just had the apple cinnamon coffee cake and some coffee. It's always good and not amazing by any means, but this is a place you come to with friends the morning after a football game to cap off a fall weekend in Madison. 

Come to Mickie's with an empty stomach, have a scrambler, coffee cake, or some chocolate chip pancakes, and you will not leave disappointed or hungry!"}
{"text":"Loooove this place; I've been going here for 25 years and it's a classic Madison experience. Killer milkshakes, huge pancakes and coffee cake slices, good prices. There can be somewhat of a wait for a table, but in my opinion it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great place! From price to quality to quantity, Mickey's had it all. Whoever said you couldn't have something fast, cheap, and delicious was wrong. 

Definitely recommend for breakfast or \"brunch\"."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for breakfast sat- and the entire family enjoyed it!

Go early on a sat am or the line will be out the door! The milkshakes are wonderful- my daughter had a cherry flavored one that was great. As described the place is a dive but they have reasonably priced, and good breakfast food. I ordered the pancakes- which I enjoyed. Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for breakfast in Madison. I found Mickey Dairy Bar on Yelp and all the reviews are accurate. It is in an older building but the food is great.There are frequently lines for breakfast, but it is totally worth the wait. Yes, the reviews on Mickey's are correct  as we over ordered the first time. Now we share a scrambler and it is plenty of food for two of us. We get the scrambler with spinach, mushroom and cheese. The  staff are friendly, the food comes out quick, and Mickey's has a hearty breakfast."}
{"text":"Busy place, there may be a waiting line.  Cash only and four of us ate at the counter ...starting with homemade blueberry and an apple cinnamon coffee cake.... they both were delicious!  The breakfast scrambler with the gravy was quite amazing; the pancake I would not recommend; corn beef hash was quite enjoyable; the French toast was good, yet eggy; the omelette made to order was quite large and tasty for the price.  If I were in the area again I would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"This place was mediocre at best. Prices were good, overall execution of my dish was poor. My toast was very soggy, yanks undercooked, and my buddy says don't get the pancakes because they don't taste like pancakes. (Odd texture and they're not fluffy.)"}
{"text":"7 years at UW and decided to check this place off my bucket list before leaving Madison. Ohhh myyy how did I put this place off this long!?!??! We were fortunate and  got seated right away. Wait staff was soo friendly and happily recommended the staple scrambler which I went with while my friend got omelet. I had my scrambler with mushroom, bacon and spinach! We only waited 10 mins for our food.. Super fast for a restaurant crowded with people, definitely a bonus. The scrambler was fantastic! Hash on the bottom, scrambler, topped with lots of cheddar cheese and I had my gravy on the side. Sometimes hash can be greasy but not here. I thought the greasiness was just about right.. Or just right for the hungover morning i had. The portion was ginormous!! I end up taking half of the portion home and had another breakfast of champions the next morning and it tasted just good! I end up going back again a week later and got the same thing. Same nomness!"}
{"text":"The most unhealthy place I have ever eaten. The scrambler is insane! Eggs + meat + cheese. Oh my lord it's huge. If you can handle the cholesterol spike, go."}
{"text":"This place has a very unique old school atmosphere.  I had the scrambler which was giant and good!  More than a grown man can eat in one sitting.  They only take cash; however, there is an ATM for you to use."}
{"text":"Mickies is a Madison classic. There's a reason this place has a line outside of it any given weekend morning. Mickies is a nice classic dinner vibe in the middle of a city with a food culture that is sometimes too trendy and too pricy. It's the perfect place for a game day breakfast or to nurse your hangover after a fun night out. Mickies is a classic dinner with affordable food and huge portions. For example, their delicious milkshakes come in the metal mixing cup, so you really get the full serving! However, considering the amount of leftovers customers have to box up, I do wish Mickies offered to-go boxes that weren't made of styrofoam."}
{"text":"If you like big cheap breakfast with usually long lines. Come here. 

Things I've tried: 

Oriental chicken omelet: interesting, not in a good way. It's dinner meets breakfast and just didn't work for me. Imagine throwing Chinese take out leftovers into your morning scrambler, if that sounds appetizing -go for it. 

Build you own omelet (corned beef, tomato, onion): delicious! Nothing fancy. Just tomatoes, onions and corned need folded into an omelet. Toppings were not saut√©ed beforehand so raw onion taste (I didn't mind) 

Coffee: cheap, does the job."}
{"text":"For a breakfast place, Mickies is fantastic. This place has great scrambles and omelettes. The potatoes here were well cooked and well seasoned. A bit greasy, but for breakfast, cooking eggs in bacon fat is fantastic. Unfortunately it's rather packed in here during the morning and can be a bit cramped and uncomfortable. 

The service was quick and friendly. 

All in all, pretty solid food, for a great price. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"If you are UW student or just live downtown this place is a most visit! Mickies has been around for a very very long time, My grandfather told me stories about when it was open until midnight while he attend UW back in the forties! Just image Mickies as drunk food! The food is delicious. The service is fantastic. My personal favorite is the tuna melt with yanks. There are also great lunch specials that come with yanks, soup and soft drink for around $5!!!!! Remember that Mickies is cash only and gets very busy on Sunday."}
{"text":"Old school diner that is usually busy.  If you want a milkshake for breakfast, this is the place.  I've always had friendly and quick service.  Huge portion sizes to fill you up for most of the day."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast and Bang for Your Buck

Well there is no way that this joint is not 5 Stars. I've been here once and I don't care I feel confident with my assessment. Friendly service, huge portions, and very wallet/Purse friendly. I'm not going to long winded with this review because this is simple folks. pancakes bigger than my hand see my pic. Some of the best home made  cornbeef hash I had and the price is crazy cheap. More beef than hash for sure. A meal like this at home in Ft. Lauderdale with the portion served to me would cost at least 18 to 20 bucks. Easy. Here with coffee $12.25. The buttermilk pancake was nice and fluffy and I just put syrup on it and no butter and it was excellent. 

Ambiance.

No nonsense mom and pop old style joint goes to college.   That about sums it up.

Verdict

You should already be walking, biking, running, taking a cab, a bus or driving here before you finish reading my review. LOL.  Stay Hungry!"}
{"text":"VERY popular Madison institution for breakfast/brunch, with prime location on Monroe St., right across from Camp Randall.  This is a no-frills, 50's throwback, Badger-loving eatery, with their menu posted on the wall above the kitchen, counter seating in the center and booths all around.  If you can handle a bit of a wait on weekends, you'll walk out of there happy and stuffed.  
I always get their popular Scrambler, which is basically a large omelet with cheese, served over potatoes, and your choice of 3 meat/veggies filling (extras cost a little more).  The service is fast, friendly and it's a fun atmosphere to be in (says the guy suddenly longing for his college years again!)."}
{"text":"I've been reading the past reviews and there's always the occasional comment that the food is mediocre at best. The fact is, Mickey's (in my personal opinion) is not really for everyone. If you're looking for a refined breakfast that offers healthy options, look somewhere else. This is a place for the hungry, the sloppy eaters and people (college students=myelf) who will not find a better deal for a hearty american breakfast at 7 bucks.  At the end of the day, it is what it is, a classic all american diner, and i'm hoping it stays that way even when i come back to visit in the future!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but get there early to beat the crowds. The Scrambler is iconic. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went to Mickeys on a Saturday morning about eight, no lines and Not very busy . Seated ourselves, it was small so I could understand why at times there could be people waiting in line out the door. Ordered corn beef hash and the waiter said we'd either love it or hate it,didn't like it, took it away and got us breakfast potatoes right away, no charge! Good happy employees, reasonably priced food in large portions served in a diner that takes you back in time."}
{"text":"The only things I would give a 4-5* for in this place would be the atmosphere and service. It's a quaint little diner ambience which is fun. Food, however, was very disappointing. Our French toast was cold, the over hard egg was undercooked, but the two good items were the scrambler w/ gravy and the side of bacon. Coffee was hot and always filled. Very loud so if you're wanting a quiet breakfast i'd avoid this place. Don't think we'll go back."}
{"text":"To be fair, I haven't been there for breakfast, so maybe I missed out on \"the best experience of a lifetime,\" yada yada...

I went for lunch.  My sandwich was good, the fries were good, the milkshake I shared with my boyfriend was EXCELLENT, and huge - it filled both of our glasses & then some.  Even better- when he asked for the milkshake, she brought out TWO glasses along with the metal shaker, w/o either of us saying anything... hah - I got automatic access to the milkshake w/o having to get permission from him ;)

The food was pretty much just like any other family style diner in Wisconsin (and many other places.)  But you do get a LOT to eat, and the employees were very helpful & nice.  If the place is so packed every weekend morning like they say it is, I don't understand why they can't afford to upgrade the building a little bit - it's practically falling apart!  Maybe because the prices are so cheap... I was looking at the menu ((on the wall!)) and thinking, \"wow, I wonder if they turn a profit!!))

If greasy-spoon diners creep you out, don't go.  If you're thinking of going for a leisurely late morning breakfast on a weekend, don't go.  If you want a good, cheap meal and you're not on a diet, eat your heart out!

And no matter what else you order, ALWAYS get a milkshake or a malt.

Heaven!"}
{"text":"Being from NYC, you never get to see this kind of restaurant.  The whole neighborhood, college town, friendly, homegrown atmosphere is very lovely and hard to come by.  As early as we came on a Sunday and with a party of 2, we still had to wait for a seat.  Anything more than 2 would've been hard to get a table for.  We took our seats at the breakfast and were quickly greeted with coffee and a friendly smile.

The menu is simple American breakfast food; you get your eggs, sausage, bacon, pancakes, etc.  It's wonderful to see the original menu still up on the wall from oh so many years ago.  We took the plunge on the scrambler.  SHARE THIS!  It was such a huge dish for one person, almost to point of wastefulness.  We made sure to share so we won't end up hating our meal.  We ended the meal with a shake to go.  

Nothing but good feelings about this place for a big breakfast and hometown feel."}
{"text":"We usually go to Stacks  and wanted to try something new.  This is a great breakfast spot. Expect to wait a while but worth it.  Omelettes and pancakes were excellent.  Portions are massive.  Shakes are good.  Try the cinnamon roll!! The inside is cramped and bathroom is nasty so be forewarned.  Staff was really friendly. Great value.  Definitely will repeat."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever, and the original mid-century signage (with mid-century prices) is still up. I was originally ordering off of it, thinking it was the actual menu haha.
Mickies serves great brunch/breakfast/diner-type items. I had buttermilk pancakes. Let me warn you that the portions are enormous. I only finished about half of the standard order, so I would share with a friend or pare down your portion. No complaints about the food quality at all. Only issue is no credit card machine but it's 2015. Still, I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in The World...love it! The place hasn't changed since they opened their doors in 1950-somethin' ....the best."}
{"text":"They have the most colossal flapjacks at this famous old-fashioned Near Westside breakfast dive catering to the diehard Badger fans.  Students flock here from miles around on weekend mornings to nurse their achy hangover heads back to health over a massive plate of grub and a cup of strong coffee."}
{"text":"If Mickies was not on campus I am not sure if it would make it like it does but it fits perfectly into student world. Huge mounds of food for cheap and seat yourself atmosphere that makes this place feel perfect for any poor college student or alum who wants to pretend they are still in school. The fact that they do not take credit cards is a pain but only adds to the feel of the place. Somehow it all feels right at Mickies."}
{"text":"If you don't go to Mickie's at least once a month, do you even live in Madison? I've been here so many times and it has never disappointed. It's great. You get really big portions for what's usually only a few bucks. Their waffles are amazing, but I have also been equally satisfied with their omelettes! My only complaint is that on Saturday/Sunday mornings, it gets super crowded and the staff isn't great at handling it. I know a buzzer system/a bigger place would take away from  a lot of the 'fifties' charm that I and so many other people love about it, but I think it would be worth it as well. Either way, if the wait is not too long for your taste then I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"yummmmmmy. This place is just delicious and the portions are freaking huge! I don't have much to say because all the other reviewers pretty much said what I have to say. You really just have to come and try this place for yourself. You won't be disappointed! Also... Their gravy is DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Just went here today with some coworkers after months of being told I HAVE to check it out, and it did not disappoint! Whenever I drive by the place on weekends there's a line out the door, but 10am on a Wednesday seems like a good time to go if you want to be guaranteed a table--there was almost no one there. I love that the interior is so no-frills and that the restaurant looks probably the same as it always has. I could definitely see it being a great hang-out for students on the weekends. I ordered a scrambler with cheese and veggies and a side of toast, and I got a slice of blueberry coffee cake to go. Everything on the menu is dirt-cheap, and you get a lot of food for the price. I was able to finish my whole breakfast and it held me over until dinner! The service was friendly and quick, too. If you're looking for high cuisine and adventurous flavors, this isn't the place for you--the food is good, but I felt like my scrambler could have at least used some salt. But if you want huge portions of semi-trashy (in the best possible way), down-home cooking, Mickies hits the spot. I'll be back, and I'll be sure to try one of their huge pancakes next time!"}
{"text":"So I had heard great things. I think the love of this place is largely related to college nostalgia and the death grip some use to try and hang on to their youth. 
I get it. 
My college town of Orono, Maine had a handful of restaurants that he a special place in my heart. They were dark, small, not so clean and If I went back and ate the food now... I'm not sure it would be as good as I remember. 
I ordered the coffee, pancakes and a side of potatoes. 
Weirdly the potatoes were amazing... I have since thought of ordering just the potatoes to go.
The pancake was a disaster, the inside consistency was paste. It was browned and golden looking on the outside but very dense and had an awful texture. 
I will say the waitress was a saint. 
I have worked in diners in a previous life and would dread the complains that would trickle in. 
She took my pancake away/ took it off the bill as I enjoyed my mountain of delicious potatoes and before I left she brought me a cinnamon bun to take with me at no charge. She assured me I would love it. \"Warm it up in the microwave for 20 seconds\" she said. 
She was right. I will be back and will order more cautiously. 
I will likely get my meal To go."}
{"text":"I'm probably going to be shunned for this review...and granted, I wasn't here hungover on a weekend morning so I may have to give it one more shot sometime soon. But, if given a choice I would not make the trek to Mickies for breakfast food again. 

I know, I know. It's practically treason to say that in Madison. But I have definitely experienced better. Hence the 2 stars. 

Came here at 1 PM on a weekday for lunch with my co-workers. My boss was craving a milkshake so we made the hike over to Mickies. I had heard enough about the place so I wasn't expecting much as far as ambiance goes. It really is a dive bar/diner feel. Which I don't dislike, there's definitely a place for that kind of scene in the breakfast food scene. There was hardly anyone there so we were seated right away. Service overall was poor. Sure things came out quickly but our server was downright rude and inattentive. It was clear that it was the end of his shift and he was really upset that we had walked through the door.

On to the food, it was all a lot of meh. I ordered a scrambler with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. Topped with Cheddar cheese with the gravy on the side. First of all most of the potatoes at the bottom were burnt and practically inedible. Which was sad because the ones I did taste were pretty yummy. The eggs and everything in the actual scrambler were cooked well. But I'm pretty sure the mushrooms were out of a can which was disappointing. Cheese on top was shredded and hardly melted, gravy was okay but my dad makes better. Other people at my table seemed to enjoy their food just fine. The milkshakes received a \"pretty good\"rating. 

So, like I said, I'll probably give it one more shot when I'm hungover on a Saturday morning and craving greasy breakfast food. Maybe next time I'll try the pancakes instead. It honestly makes me sad to write this review because of the nostalgia of the place, but there are definitely better breakfast places in Madison."}
{"text":"SO MUCH Delicious food. The portions are plentiful! Came for brunch on a Sunday, it was busy. The staff was great and service was fast. Definitely coming back before I leave town."}
{"text":"What once was a bi-weekly weekend breakfast staple in my undergraduate years, now is a faint memory of coffee malts, scramblers of old, and nostalgic-tasting (mediocre) coffee in just as nostalgic of a mug.

The cash-only, stand-and-wait-for-days line, is part of the experience. I recall shivering fall and winter Sunday mornings after a Saturday of exhausting UW Marching Band  insanity, longing for a coffee malt and hot coffee on the side. 

Favorites include the legendary scrambler: Green peppers, onions, mushrooms, cheddar and pepper jack cheese with gravy on the side and Frank's hot sauce. My mouth waters instantly at the the thought!

Coffee cake is yummy, malts and shakes are out of this world tasty, pancakes are classic and plate-size (try the chocolate chip and banana walnut combined, if they still offer walnuts...just ask!). French toast is standard and sweet to the max! 

And lest we not forget, Mickies DOES have lunch/dinner options, even if they're not open late! A late morning cheeseburger or reuben? You're darn tootin'!

If you're looking for pristine, uber-clean, and snazzy. Go away. The charm of Mickies is it's long line, 'whad'l'ya have\" staff that doesn't have time to chit chat, and stick-to-your-ribs Midwestern diner-style breakfast.

Go. Go now. Go later. Go yesterday. Just go!"}
{"text":"Ew. Ew ew ew. My palette is not THAT discerning, by any means. But. Flavorless canned mushrooms and frozen spinach in my omelet. No seasoning, and just sort of a big sloppy mess dropped onto a plate. Took forever to take our order, much less get it to us. Only reason it's getting 2 stars is that the hash browns were okay. Not really sure why it gets such high reviews."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to love this place. I love breakfast and hit Sophie (Sofia's?) on the East side, which I loved. I love dirty spoons/diners. It's not about the decor or even the service-it's about the food. You may get quantity but what good it quantity without quality? The scrambler was a big plate-but the bottom was about a 1/3 lb of breakfast potatoes, gravy was low quality and a little funky. I had the french toast which was cinnamon bread dipped one side in egg. In fact-one side of the french toast was egg yolk yellow and the other was plain bread. The bread wasn't soaked-it was more of a fried egg bread than french toast. Also-the place is called a DAIRY BAR and the cream for your coffee is the little cups on Dean's creamer that sit out all day. I can see this as a hangover place for Camp Randall kids-the price point is low. But so was the experience. I think the place is resting on its laurels-the nostalgia and location will bring locals in-but not a place I would ever make a special trip to again."}
{"text":"On an adventure from California.  A friend and I stopped into a local gem for Madison WI eats and we were not disappointed!

Ambiance was down to earth and by no means pretentious.  Lots of families and/or groups of men or women just getting together to enjoy a meal over conversation  (whatever that may be).  The place was busy and a good kind of loud...the kind where you know everyone is having a good time.

Service was fantastic (so friendly and out of her way helpful) and the food good!  We ordered chocolate chip pancakes (melted chocolate chips in most bites---yum) and the scramble with bacon and tomato (gravy on the side).  Price was incredibly reasonable at $16 for generous portions.

Everyone- Consider this spot recommended!"}
{"text":"Go early. Friendly, helpful waitstaff, reasonable prices, slightly overwhelming menu. The scrambler and yanks are really good, as is the coffee and OJ. Friends liked the corned beef hash."}
{"text":"YUM!  This busy little place has an actual bar. 

I grabbed a stool at the bar on a Saturday morning and ordered the Scrambler with sausage. YUM!  It's the perfect combination of creamy egg, melting cheese, perfectly cooked potatoes, and yummy sausage.  The place is huge and comes with four half slices of wheat toast.  Best $7 spent.

The Blueberry Coffee Cake was also good at only $2.  The coffee is mediocre at $1.50."}
{"text":"Wow! Mickies really lives up to the hype. I'm kicking myself for have lived here a year and half without having tried out this Madison staple yet. Itseemed very cozy and friendly - The staffers, the other patrons, and the building itself were all inviting.

4 stars for the food's taste. 5 stars for the serving sizes and prices. (They also brought it out super-fast, though to be fair, we showed up a 1:45pm and the restaurant was only 2/3rds full.)"}
{"text":"OLD SCHOOL DINER.  
If you could bottle the smell, taste, and look you would be a rich man!
Barely anything has changed, original menu maybe slightly tweaked, but otherwise this is a genuine diner for breakfast, and breakfast I can eat at any meal.
Be prepared to come early on the weekend if you don't want to wait in line.  
My favorite is still rye toast with fluffy scrambled eggs and bacon.
DELISH.
Absolute must to take guests, newbies, or any others that somehow missed this spot right on Monroe Street."}
{"text":"The scrambler is delicious and it's only 7 dollar (big portion!) And the people here are friendly too. We were lucky enough to get free blueberry cake from them :)"}
{"text":"This diner-style joint is at the center of food quality, service, and value for your money. It might not be the type of place you would take a special guest, but it's a great stop over on a lazy Sunday morning with family or friends.

The scrambler is always good, and big enough to split between two people. Pancakes are giant-sized, cakey, and make excellent leftovers. My go-to items are the blueberry coffee cake, a side of bacon, and the refillable coffee. I can always count on the coffee. Game days are usually really crowded, but the line moves along pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Came here a few times for breakfast. It's a pretty good place to grab breakfast on a weekday morning. Apparently the wait is a whole nother story during the weekends, but since I don't live in the neighborhood, i've never experienced the weekend crowd. So far, everything has been tasty. The portions are huuuge! The only down side is they are cash only."}
{"text":"A Madison icon. Simple throwback diner style. Cash only. The food is delicious but come hungry because the servings are enormous. 

I've tried the scrambler (of course) with the gravey on top. The chili cheese omelet is also a favorite. And you can't go wrong with pancakes. Order a milkshake with breakfast. Yes... Seriously. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"They give you A LOT of food. I make my yelp ratings base on taste and dining experience which are both just good here.  There are places that I give 4/5 stars to and would never go back but  I would come back over and over again just because it is decent and affordable."}
{"text":"This is the only place I want to eat breakfast when visiting Madison.  I've been going here for years with my high school buddies.  After a long Saturday night of partying and fun, we would wake up Sunday morning and head to Mickies.  

A lot of times there's a line outside of the restaurant so get there as early as possible as it gets busy really fast  The last time there was almost 15 people ahead of us and we still got a table in about 10 minutes, which is pretty good.  

It's a small little diner and the menu is up against the back wall.  Everything is fairly cheap, but not as cheap as the prices from the 1950s menu that they have displayed on the other wall.  
The portions of the food is decent for what you're paying for.  I love my omelets and I got the chili cheese omelet last time...so good!"}
{"text":"In college we had a monthly tradition of going to Mickies on a Friday morning, ordering scramblers and then overcoming a looming food comatose in class. You can feel the tradition in this place going back decades, with generations of UW students who have had their breakfast here.

Alongside Camp Randall football, Union Terrace euchre, farmer's market saturdays, and jogging out to picnic point, Mickies Dairy Bar is one of my favorite memories from student life in Madison.

Just one note though - they only take cash so visit the ATM beforehand."}
{"text":"Really loved the retro vibe going on in this place! Went here with a party of four. There was about a fifteen minute wait on a Saturday morning, not bad. We got seated at a shared table top. All four of us ordered the breakfast scrambler. I got mine with sausage and over medium eggs. The scrambler was smothered in gravy and the over medium eggs added to the delicious ooziness. I believe it came with 3-4 eggs, and the dish was massive. I was probably able to eat only 1/4th of it. For only about $8, it's a deal and you definitely won't leave hungry. This scrambler came with everything that a scrambler should have: cheese, gravy, potatoes, eggs, sausage or bacon, you get what I'm trying to say! I recommend you come early, or you bundle up because you'll be waiting in the long line outside! Can't wait to go back! Also, this is a cash only restaurant."}
{"text":"Worth the lines.  Try the scrambler--remember to share it with another person, it's nearly impossible to finish yourself.  Can't go wrong with anything off their menu here.  Cash only, tip well!"}
{"text":"My luck with finding cash-only establishments recently has become more of an annoyance than a welcomed change of pace. I'm not intentionally seeking these places out! But, as long as what you're offering is worth me having cash and loose change in my pocket, I'll curb my attitude. Mickies Dairy Bar - the place that will serve you a scrambler that you can't finish in just one sitting. Or at least that is what I was told - and to my friend, after I stopped laughing at his tale, I told him there could be no such place.

I was wrong.

I ordered the scrambler for breakfast, with a large milk and a side of toast (though, I think the toast came with it - but that's neither here nor there). That scrambler of potatoes, eggs, cheese and meat (I know there was bacon in there!) filled my entire plate - and it was not a small plate! I didn't waste time admiring the portion of food I was served, I dug right in. It was just as tasty as it smelled! Bite after bite, I continued to enjoy it, after about two-thirds I realized that if I chose to finish it, I was likely going to feel sick for the rest of the day. I still had enough to make it a nice lunch later, so I threw in the towel and gave in to the hearty meal.

So my friend was right, you can't finish it in one sitting (assuming that you add the idea of leaving comfortably to the end of his sentence). Believe me, if there was a wall of shame, I would have made it up there - but there was no point in doing it if all I'd leave with was an aching stomach.

The actual venue itself was pretty retro, you could eat at a booth or table, but if you didn't want to wait, you could just belly up to the bar - as I did. Though, if you're 6'4\" like myself, waiting for a table or booth with the necessary leg room should be something to consider. Needless to say, I won't be sitting up at the bar again, it was a bit uncomfortable.

Look around at the walls while you're there. They still have their original signs up that advertise a time where meals were down right cheap! Don't forget to bring some cash and use some of it to tip your waitress."}
{"text":"OMG! OMG! I fell in love with this place as soon as I walked in.  I don't think the place has been remodeled since the 40's and Mickies, please don't, it looks fab. I started out with the Chili Mac Soup, OMG it's the best I ever had.  My eldest got the Milk Shake, pancakes and tatters, I got the scrambler.  OMG, OMG the food was HUGE!  I am a big gal and I could not even finish half of my meal. The pancakes could wrap a mans hands they were so big.  They serve Pepsi products which is an excellent choice.  The waitress we had was friendly and help me with my order.  I just love this place!"}
{"text":"Long line, weird seating, great prices, and food that lacked flavor and texture. 

This is a great place for college students to go because the food is inexpensive and you don't have to cook it. For everyone else, just go to experience it and that's it. Because honestly, it's a cool place to go just because it's been around for so long and hasn't changed much. Otherwise, it doesn't offer much.

I was with a group of 5. We waited for around an hour to get inside the diner, and then were seated at the bar. It was noisy and really difficult for all of us to have a conversation. The menu is very basic, which cheap, greasy bar food. My man and I split a scrambler with spinach and onion. The potatoes were soggy, and I don't think any of it was salted. We also split an order of banana nut pancakes, which we took a few bites of and decided we didn't need any more. The pancakes are thick and dense, not lofty and fluffy like a good pancake should be. 

Overall, I'm glad I tried it, but I probably won't be returning. There are other good places to go."}
{"text":"Mickies Dairy Bar is a great, uber-popular breakfast joint right near Camp Randall Stadium. The food is delicious and the portions are gluttonous, so make sure you come hungry wearing stretchy clothes.

I highly recommend their milkshakes and pancakes.

Seating used to be a problem as it was a free-for-all: if you showed up with 4 people, you had to wait for 4 seats at the same table to open up and then hope you got to them before another group of 1-4 did. Luckily, they now have a host(ess) person who seats groups in the order in which they arrive, which is a GREAT improvement."}
{"text":"Note that this review is solely for the pancakes (specifically the banana nut ones). If you go there, get something else. After all, other reviewers seem to like this place okay. Each pancake was like a thick slab of cardboard. They were way too dry. You could barely choke them down, and when I drenched them in syrup to try and moisten them up (to the point where the syrup was nearly overpowering), it was still too dry. Once again, I don't know about the other food, but go somewhere else for pancakes."}
{"text":"Mickies sure is great... friendly staff, large amounts of food and decent prices. I always eat too much and feel sick after (which isn't their fault, I just need to chew more)"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. Mainly because I've heard a lot of great things about it, but our experience was forgettable.

My wife's family came into town from CA for our wedding and we chose this place for breakfast. The portions were enormous and most of them enjoyed their meals. My wife ordered the chocolate pancakes and she barely made a dent in it. Now this is a woman who will bathe in chocolate if she could, but she didn't care much for it. I had scrambled eggs with sausage and bacon and hash browns. It was pretty average. 

Overall, everyone else thought the place was great because of the portions and most were hungover. My wife and I, the locals, weren't too impressed."}
{"text":"Mickies is the best breakfast joint in Madison.   Been going Mickie's for 20 years and have never been disappointed with the experience.   Favorite dish is the bacon scrambler."}
{"text":"Love this place! Unfortunately my pancakes are sometimes undercooked, but otherwise everything else is really good and service is surprisingly fast considering how busy they are."}
{"text":"Just like hundreds of people did, I went to Mickies Dairy Bar before the Badgers game yesterday.   Two hours before the game, there was a line wrapped around outside about 20 deep. 

It's a cash only establishment, so be prepared to bring a few coins.

I went with my son.  We definitely had to have scramblers (although everything else looked fantastic).  He had the bacon cheddar scrambler.  I wanted to go rogue, so I got a scrambler with corned beef hash (in place of the potatoes and $1.25 more) with bacon and cheddar.  You can get gravy on the omelet or on the side - I'd advise to get it on the side, so you can fold it in or dunk one of your two pieces of toast in.

With the potatoes (or corned beef hash in my case), they come to your table appearing as if they're six-egg omelets - massive is an understatement!  

On the table is Vietnamese version of Sriracha (Double Chicken Brand, I believe) and the customary blend of salt and pepper.  

The taste is incredible.  I really enjoyed it with the hash rather than the fried potatoes.  Their hash is deliciously chunky and spicy (it tastes like it has a chili and maybe a bit of a curry thing going on). The eggs were a perfect topper with what was likely a 1/2 a lb. of shredded cheddar.  

The calorie counter died on the way to the table - I think I swallowed it with the corned beef.  

With water, I had coffee.  It was the standard diner coffee, but maybe a little bit weaker than some.  My son stuck with water.

The bill for approximately 10,000 calories of goodness  (remember, the counter was lost in the carnage, so I may be a bit off) - only $16.87!!!   As far as calories (and saturated fat) per dollar - this is has to be one of the deals around.  In addition, the food (taste and preparation) was perfect for our cravings.

Tip: The crowd eased up about an hour before kickoff, so that might be the best bet going forward if lines are to be avoided."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is the best breakfast/brunch place in all of Madison (because I've never been there for dinner).

If you're looking for a big, hearty breakfast at a cheap price, Mickies Dairy Bar is the way to go. I highly recommend the scrambler, a huge egg-fiasco with your choice of ingredients. By the way, it's huge. But, truth be told, anything and everything on their breakfast menu is fabulous. I love the banana cinnamon nut pancakes, the steak and eggs, the french toast, and their omelettes (forgot which omelettes I had, but I assure you they're all good).

Anyways, my advice is to go to Mickies Dairy Bar with an empty stomach and a hungry appetite because sometimes you might just want to order more than one thing. I will forewarn you that you might have to wait a bit on Saturday mornings, but it'll be worth it for sure."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast/brunch in autumn of 08. It was very good! I loved my blueberry shake, it was super delicious. The breakfast food was satisfying, but wasn't knock your socks off insanely awesome or special. I'd definitely go here again, it's a very homey, comfort food kind of place. Try the shakes!"}
{"text":"Highly overrated.  The food was awful.  Service mediocre.  Hair in the food on top of it.  So disappointing."}
{"text":"Awesome food, service and atmosphere! This place is TINY and they only take cash, so be prepared. The wait can get long on the weekends, but its worth it. 

The scrambler is always great, but its a humongous portion, so go hungry! The cinnamon rolls and daily coffee cake are worth the extra $1 and the griddle cakes (oatmeal batter with raisins) are delicious.  I've never tries their lunch items because breakfast is too good, but I always see a lot of people ordering sandwiches so imagine they're tasty as well. 

Definitely a \"must\" when in Madison."}
{"text":"You cannot find a better value for your dollar for breakfast in Madison.  This place does everything very well, but in my opinion, they do 2 things outstanding which absolutely cannot be beat in Madison:

1.) Home made Corned Beef Hash - AMAZING - I think they put onion and cumin in it which gives it a really unique flavor.  It's so good, I'll sometimes go there to have it for lunch.  Add 2 eggs (over easy) to it, and you won't be let down.

2.) Griddle Cakes - Oatmeal pancakes packed with cinnamon apples and raisins.  Don't even try to finish it, expect leftovers.  You've are warned...

Seriously great breakfast, and the lines out the door tell it all.

To avoid the lines, get there by 7-8 a.m (especially on weekends)."}
{"text":"This place is legend....dairy.   Maybe it's nostalgic college memories, but it is still home to my all time favorite breakfast, the scrambler.  I have mine with sausage, gravy and cheese on top.  I still make it a point to go back whenever in Madison.  Last time in town I brought my wife for the first time.  We ordered a scrambler and an order of hot cakes to share.  She liked it so much she didn't share.  I got stuck with the pancakes (not a bad consolation prize).  The only solution was to go back the next day and get 2 scramblers.  True story."}
{"text":"In town for homecoming weekend - Go Badgers! - our group had to try Mickie's.  We went on a Friday morning and the 6 of us waited maybe 5 minutes and were able to grab a big table, a big deal since it's seat yourself.  

The service was a little slow, but it's an old fashioned breakfast place, so it was expected.  As a vegetarian and health nut, I was so very happy to see whole grain pancakes on the menu board.  They were.....different.  Kind of like bread, thick, and huge.  I liked them though.  The boys of course tackled the Scrambler.....and didn't eat until 8pm that night because they were so stuffed.  

Overall, a cheap breakfast place near campus which us visitors enjoyed for it's individuality."}
{"text":"On this (of many past) occasion I got 2 huge whole grain pancakes and a monster sized veggie omelet with toast for just a bit over $12 and it was amazing! Filling is an understatement! It hit the spot and then some lets just say that much. Plate sized, hot thick pancakes full of fluffy flapjack goodness on one plate and then a plain omelet stuffed with 6, yes 6 veggies (of my choosing) on the other. Service was fast and friendly despite a fairly busy Thursday morning (8am) I was please with this experience on many levels! It saddens me to be relocating 2000 miles away by the end of the month for work! I will miss Mickies dearly!"}
{"text":"Mickie's Dairy Bar takes you far from the hustle and bustle of downtown Madison. You forget where you are- more so you forget when you are. With a purposeful vintage feel, complete with the original menu from the 50s, you definitely escape fully from today's life and get a chance to relax.

The staff is incredibly friendly, courteous, and warm. Our food came out incredibly fast, was piping hot, and delicious. My best friend ordered one of the skillets, and I got the corned beef hash with eggs and toast. The second they set the food down on your table, they ask, \"would you like any hot sauce with that?\" - as any quality breakfast place should. Her food was delicious, but the corned beef hash stole it for me. It was perfectly seasoned, had bits of crisp and crunch, and the eggs were cooked just as I had asked.

The only reason they get 4 instead of 5 is because it is cash only, and my card wouldn't work with the ATM inside the building. They were prepared and told me that the Wise next door had a less fussy ATM, which was wonderful, but square readers aren't too much trouble and you can get so much more business that way. There's a lot of us that don't carry cash anymore."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best restaurants in Wisconsin and hands down the best breakfast place around here. You can order anything off the menu and you can know for sure it's gonna be absolutely delicious. If I have to complain about something, it has to be the bacon. The cut is too thin. But everything else... Mmmm Hmmm!"}
{"text":"I love Mickie's! The place is a bit cramped and you will probably have to wait a while before being seated. The food is definitively worth the wait, though! The pancakes are like little pillows!  A visit to Mickie's makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside and brings me back to my days as a student at UW. :-)"}
{"text":"I'm from back east and this place was suggested by some locals. The scrambler was epic deliciousness. My kids had the chocolate chip pancake (HUGE) and scrambled eggs with ham. My picky eaters devoured that food. The portions were huge so we have enough for lunch. Also, milkshakes with breakfast. I officially feel like I'm on vacation! Next time I'm in Wisconsin, I'll be stopping here. The staff is amazing, atmosphere is awesome. We need a place like this in my hometown!"}
{"text":"I read the mixed reviews on here about Mickies - and returned myself a few weeks back. I hadn't been to Mickies in years, but it was as great as I remembered it. 

Now, comparing it to a foo-foo fancy breakfast place isn't fair. This is an old dated joint - with a menu on the wall and napkin dispensers from long before my dad was born. Plus, I don't know what most people order - but the breakfast I ordered was not anything I would consider healthy. It was good old fashion, great tasting, greasy fattening breakfast. That's what makes this place great!!

We got great service - the waitress was super nice and very funny - great food and it was very very affordable. This place is fantastic and I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Mickies Dairy Bar is awesome b/c it is a Madison staple that is located walking distance from Camp Randall (and coincidentally by where I lived for two years). Mickies Dairy Bar is also awesome b/c they serve the BEST milkshakes in town!! I mean the kind that come in that old school tin cup that keeps 'em cold for hours. 

My only real gripes about Mickies is that for some reason I had a hard time figuring out their hours AND don't even think about coming here the morning of football games unless you get up at the crack of dawn and have pretty good patience/tolerance of the cold and major hunger pains... :("}
{"text":"Huge portions!!! Their scramblerd are extremely big! I can usually take some to go. their milkshakes are tasty as well. There's  usually a line of you go at brunch time, but anytime after 1 there's no wait. Remember its cash only"}
{"text":"Very large portions of food that all seem to be very potatoe heavy.  I guess that's how they keep their prices so low.
I've been going here for years due to its 1 block from house.  The service has been the worst I've ever received in a restaurant Period!  Our group had some confusion over the number of pancakes and the waiter / manager responded with \"Don't be a dick\".  I was a loyal customer for many years but, not anymore.
Sorry Mickeys but you have an employee that is destroying your reputation .
The coffee cake is fantastic and the other staff is great."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with any of the options here! Anything you order will be delicious."}
{"text":"Mickies is definitely that thing about Madison which I'll miss the most. I've tried most of what they have on their menu over the past couple of years and have never yet had a bad order. Everything is very reasonably priced and tastes as good as they can possibly get. They're insanely crowded on weekends, but are generally very free on weekdays, especially for lunch. My near-regular lunch order was that of a tuna salad sandwich, which is one of the freshest I've found around. The staff is also super friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Oh man, where else can you get a blueberry milkshake with a heaping midwest breakfast? Nowhere. Always worth the wait for this heart attack inducing cafe."}
{"text":"Love the old school charm of the place! Had a corn bread pancake, a serve of griddle and the reuben omelette. The omelette comes highly recommended and it does live up to its reputation! Friendly service and homely atmosphere. It's cash only though."}
{"text":"I think my first visit to Mickies' was in 1992. Was the founder of Yelp even born yet?! We didn't have much of a wait on UW Spring Break Saturday morning. And Monroe Street was torn up for construction, so it was a task just getting there, perhaps keeping away the less than hearty trekkers. 

Some might call Mickies a greasy spoon, except for it's impeccably clean! It's a classic diner, and breakfast is their specialty. Go for breakfast and amuse yourself- it's worth the wait. 

- Banana Nut pancakes- a huge order and very yummy
- Corned Beef Hash scrambler- my dining partner loved her dish!
- Coffee was nice and bold, and refilled often by our server and others

Service is great, and breakfast was affordable, and afforded me two meals. I'll have to come back just for a milkshake. 

What a Madison institution, thanks for not changing a bit, Mickies Dairy Bar!"}
{"text":"Not only huge portions, but also delicious food. The service is quick. Even during weekend lunch time, the wait time was reasonable and the service was very homely. The attendant helped to get right dishes - based on the dietary preferences. The only flipside is : they accept ONLY cash...Overall hidden gem (may be known only UW students)"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in town hands down. You may have to wait 10-15 min max but is entirely worth the wait."}
{"text":"You've gotta stop by Mickies if you're in town.  Don't let the wait scare you - the experience is worth it, and the food is delicious! We tried their standard eggs/toast/sausage breakfast, a scrambler, and their pancakes.  Everything was amazing and exactly what you'd expect from this 50s diner.  Make sure you take note - it's cash only!"}
{"text":"This place is the epitome of an amazing college town diner! Badger decor, huge portions, completely affordable, hearty meals and awesome service! The ambiance is very chill and comfy. Just moved to Madison and already went here twice (two days in a row) because there's really nothing like this place. It's going to be hard to find another place like this in regards to service, taste, portions & price! My husband and I will definitely be regulars here! 

The only thing that might be a bummer for some people is that this place is a cash only restaurant and the parking situation. But other than that, the food will make up for it!!"}
{"text":"There are few places in Madison that match Mickey's Dairy Bar for breakfast.  The place is historically marvelous.  It's like stepping back in time.   You can enjoy classic diner decor.  The portions are generous and the price is reasonable.  It's hard to go wrong with any of the classic breakfast and lunch items on the menu. My recommendation goes out to the SCRAMBLER - a behemoth mountain of fried potato, egg, cheese, meat and veggies smothered in Gravy.  You'll also enjoy their pancake (singular) that overshadows the plate. A single pancake is a meal. Huge portions of coffee cake and cinnamon rolls are also available.  On weekends -- and when there are Badger home games -- be prepared to wait for a table. It's a small restaurant. It's worth the wait, tho!"}
{"text":"After being advised by my son to NOT eat at Mickey's, I thought, \"well, how bad could it be for breakfast?\"  The answer: very bad.  This is a sleazy, greasy, dirty dinner frequented by people who are looking for only quantity because there is no quality.  The place, on a Thursday morning, was packed.  

I ordered a cheese and bacon sandwich on toast.  The bacon had an \"off\" flavor.  I don't know if it was rancid, but the bacon was awful.  I was done after one bite. 

My sister ordered French Toast which means \"bread dipped in an egg/milk wash and fried on a griddle.  When it came, it looked like well-done scrambled eggs; no discernible pieces of bread found.   The  \"mass\" covered the entire plate.  She said there was something wrong with the French toast; it had cinnamon and the bread was lumpy.  Then she tasted the raisin.  The waitress said this was \"Mickey's take on French toast.\"  She should have said, \"This was yesterday's cinnamon raisin roll that was recycled for the poor souls who want french toast.\"  After noting my sister was not happy with the cinnamon/raisin/egg much, she brought some regular toast as requested.  

If you like a quality breakfast in a clean restaurant, this is NOT the place for you. A Waffle House is much, much better.  I should have listened to my son.  Never again will I pass though this dump."}
{"text":"THE COFFEE CAAAKE! Oh. It is the coffee cake that haunts my dreams. Moist and full of apples and topped with the most luscious, crumbly, crunchy topping. Huge, probably 5 inches tall. That alone is an excellent reason to visit here. 

The pancakes are ridiculous - bigger than your head and for sure worth sharing. The milkshakes are also huge and fabulously rich. I've had their burgers, which are scrumptiously greasy and fitting for a diner. 

I love the old-timey decor. I've been coming here since I was a kid and I don't think they've changed a single thing, which is pretty amazing. Service is quick and efficient. 

Basically, anything you get here is going to be huge and incredibly filling. Love all of it. Be prepared to wait for a table if you come at a busy time or have a group larger than 4. It's worth the wait. (I've noticed a few other reviews talk about the difficulty of \"vying for a table\" - my experience is that people are willing to be polite and orderly and establish a respectful \"no budging\" line... maybe this isn't true when the students are in town, as I usually go over summer break?) Parking might also be difficult, particularly if it's a game day."}
{"text":"Love it- its like a trip back to the 50's (I think?)

If you are a diner fan, you should make a stop here. Even if not, who doesn't like the occasional greasy spoon?

The breakfast here is great and classic. Scramblers are a good choice.

FYI - It gets really busy on weekend mornings."}
{"text":"Somewhat decent breakfast food in a crowded, dirty restaurant. I guess I don't quite get the charm of this place. There was a diner that used to be on the east side that I thought was much better. Madison really doesn't have very good options for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! I had the reuben omelette and it really tasted like a reuben sandwich in between eggs! The portions are huge and the prices are low. It's the perfect place to come to with some friends after a big night out. Only disappointment - the chocolate chip pancakes."}
{"text":"For a hangover, there is nothing like the Chili Omelet @ Mickey's Dairy bar."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today (Saturday 10:00am) and was very impressed...best breakfast food I've had in Madison yet!  I got one of their scramblers and a cup of coffee.

Pros: 
Great food.  Good value.  BIG portions.  Really friendly waitress.  Once I got a seat, the wait wasn't very long to get my food.

Cons:
RIDICULOUSLY busy.  No form of order...seat yourself.  Cash only.



Great place and I'll definitely go back!


Edit: I forgot to mention to try their coffee cake!  I got a piece of their apple cinnamon coffee cake served to go and it is the best $2 I've spent in a long time!!!"}
{"text":"Mickies is a hole-in-the-wall breakfast place, but to me and many, it's a Madison staple.  I've taken out of towners, family, and friends all here.

Hungover or sober, the food is good with very generous portions for what you pay. I'd recommend the scrambler. It's eggs, hashbrowns, and toast with cheese and meat/vegetable. The pancakes were just good but not great when my sister ordered them. 

It gets really crowded on weekends and is closed on Mondays.  Just know too that it's cash only! There's an ATM close by if needed. Breakfast usually cost less than $10 a person."}
{"text":"It may be cramped, but it's efficient, old school and still the best value breakfast around.  Huge portions, inventive home made twists on just about everything...and I dream about that corned beef hash like a pre-teen fantasizes about a rock star. Branched out to try the corn meal pancake and gooey cinnamon roll and they didn't disappoint.  Worth every minute of wait in line outside."}
{"text":"This right here is one of the Gems of Madison Dining. A nice little hole in the wall where, for less than $10, you can get a heap of food edible for 2 meals. I am, of course, referring to the one and only Scrambler. To describe it, one must experience it. You can customize this delicious dish with whatever meat or other toppings you request. As far as breakfast restaurants go, this place wins in my heart.

Oh, bring cash... they don't accept credit cards!"}
{"text":"Mickies! 

To be honest, I haven't been here in ages. I use to come here all the time when I was a student and absolutely loved it. When I was in Madison, this was the shinning beacon of breakfast joints. 

During the weekends it would get pretty crowded. So crowded that sometimes the people waiting for tables could hover you. At times, that was a bit uncomfie. Otherwise, everything else was fabulous. 

Its retro in looks and amazing in taste. Love the scramblers. I also have fond memories of their pancakes as I got to have them next to Butch Vig."}
{"text":"Second best traditional diner in the city. Good food, huge servings, good prices, I'm only giving it a 4 stars because the curve is better, and it is always packed. Impossible to get a table after 8 in the morning, especially on game day. 
The milkshakes bring all the boys (and girls) to the yard. For real."}
{"text":"Great pancakes.  My wife and I shared an order and couldn't finish. So massive and delicious."}
{"text":"Mickies Dairy Bar is an institution in Madison. It's excellent at what it does (no-frills breakfast and lunch diner food), but there's very little here that you can't either find better for cheaper at a place like The Curve, or that you could probably make as well as or better than Mickies in your own kitchen.

The ambiance is almost like stepping into a UW-Madison time capsule malt shop from the 1950s. They have old menu boards on display, the booths are weathered with a lived-in feel, the diner counter is an antique, and the bathrooms are tucked away under a squeaky wooden staircase. It can get impossibly loud on Saturdays, and I would abandon all hope of ever finding space on a Badger Football Saturday.

The service is quite good. Servers are cheerful, the kitchen is very fast (even when busy), and the coffee flows endlessly, as long as they aren't closing soon. I once wanted to do a crossword puzzle but had no writing utensil, so our server fetched one for me. They always remember to ask about the details of orders (such as whether you want gravy for your scramble on top or the side). He was pretty stingy with our coffee refills as soon as our food (quickly) came, though, since they were going to be closing. I get that he's probably exhausted - I used to work the weekend morning rushes at Marigold - but rushing us out like that (we'd gone in at least 45 minutes before closing) was obnoxious, since there were several other patrons still dining as we were leaving. If you are the kind of person who likes refills, I suggest trying a counter booth or counter stool, as you are more in their line of sight.

The food is hearty diner fare. You can order off of the breakfast meal all day, and possibly the lunch menu, too. They also have daily specials (at least during weekdays, except for Mondays when they're closed), which have generous portions and several accompaniments.The breakfast scramble is legendary, and an excellent hangover cure. It does need some salt and pepper, though. The two-egg breakfast is pretty cheap and good for an early weekday breakfast. The pancakes are enormous, and incredibly thick and heavy. A few bites are good, but I don't think I could even make it through a whole one. The coffee cake is a less-dense, delicious alternative if you like sweet food with your breakfast, especially when it has blueberries. Lunch-wise, they have fantastic sweet potato fries (sometimes), though the regular fries are nothing to write home about. The soups tend to be pretty good, but the sandwiches (toasted on the grill) are so heavy and greasy. You don't need to slather butter onto bread when you're making a Reuben with a ton of cheese and thousand island dressing; I love fatty diner food on occasion, but even this is beyond me.  The burgers are a safer bet. All in all, it's delicious and reasonably-priced after a night of regrettable drinking, but not something I crave on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Went here a year and a half ago, so let me reach back in my foggy memory.... What stands out the most, honestly, was the line. We waited for about an hour for a space (for 2 people!), and basically had to elbow some other people out of the way to get to our spot since they tried to swoop our seats! The prices were stellar. The food was good, but since I haven't been back in a year and a half when I have had ample opportunity to says something about the place.

Have to say though--that corned beef hash was HUGE and darn good. That alone was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Always must stop in for Sunday breakfast on our Madison visits to the Arboretum.  Everything the prepare is amazing & the ambiance is the best experience"}
{"text":"I'm probably going to be echoing many others claims about Mickie's when I say that it's a great place to get your lot of throwback American food in an American style. Every time i've gone there, there has been three certainties:

1. I will get the scrambler, because I love scramblers. (Comes with an add in like a veggie or meat. Note that a few of the add ins aren't too great of quality)
2. I will get a milkshake, because I love milkshakes. (Comes in numerous flavors, all are at least decent)
3. It will be extremely busy, because Badger gamedays / the only other place open for breakfast nearby is Indie Coffee, and their menu is too different to even make comparisons to Mickie's.

So yeah, i'm pretty satisfied every time I go there, but not in a \"I just had an amazing and unique dish\" way, and not a \"I just made healthy choices\" way, but in a \"I came in hungry, and now I am leaving full\" kind of way. The portions are quite large, and the prices are quite cheap. I never spend more than $15, and one could easily get a full meal here for $8. Mickie's isn't a 5, because they haven't made my favorite scrambler or milkshake ever, but they do a good job at making scramblers and Milk Shakes, so a 4 it is.

P.S. Sometimes I've gone with people who got pancakes, and they're really big, and my friends said they're really good. So yeah, if you like pancakes, you could give those a try."}
{"text":"Always went here as a kid very good service, quiality to food price is great and excellent customer service. 

They were very accommodating when I threw up all over a booth table one time. 


5 star rating"}
{"text":"This place is a Madison tradition, go there on game day, the weekend, or just when you're hungover.  Closed Mondays!  Get there early if you want a seat on Saturdays.  It's nearly impossible to get seats for a group of 5 plus when they're busy.  No waiting list or lines, prepare yourself to fight for a seat.

The place looks like it hasn't been changed in 50 years.  There's an old school bar in the center and barstool seating, along with booths around the perimeter.  

The food is filling, plentiful, and cheap.  $7 will get you more than you can eat.  Pretty standard for breakfast food, not great, not bad."}
{"text":"Mickies Dairy Bar is a Madison must-do.  Generations of UW-Students, alumni, football fans, locals, athletes and their families all frequent Mickies.  

The wait staff is friendly,  the food is good (and served in generous portions), and the atmosphere is interesting.  Decor is certainly diner grade, but that is part of the charm.  

Bring cash (no credit cards-ATM is available down the street).  Depending on time of day/year, parking may be difficult to find nearby, so plan on a short walk from one of the side streets.   Seat yourself, but be warned Mickies is popular, so you may have a wait.  Highly recommend a Scrambler and Chocolate Malt, or the corn beef hash.  I have found I much prefer their breakfast options to their burgers.  For easier seating, arrive early.  Enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Earlier I wrote a five star review of this place. The review was full of sarcasm and boredom. This is a diner that is like many other diners in the world. If you are a fan of functional, yeah, it's functional. They will put things on plates for you, and you will eat those things or not eat those things. That's entirely up to you. As far as I know the things they put on plates match the words that come out of your mouth.

Congratulations, Mickies Dairy Bar! You did your job!

That Oriental Chicken Omelet could use a better name, though."}
{"text":"Old-fashioned, no-nonsense diner.  Has the old menus on the walls.  Can sit on a swivel stool at the counter.  I got the omelet special which came with a too-big portion of home fries and coffee.  Very tasty.  I'd go back again when I'm in town, and staying at Hotel Red next door.
Cash-only!"}
{"text":"Yes there most likely will be a long line outside the door. Even so far as the end of the sidewalk to the street. But don't let that stop you from finding a parking spot.

When we went on a Sunday morning, the line was long but was moving fast. We found when we got inside that there was a person helping navigate the line.

We got seats right in front of the shake maker on the counter. Forget the name of the guy working the machine but he was a show of fun. That was he job just to make shake and malt. He showed us his hands. They looked freezer burned. Really wanted to give him a pair of gloves. Watching him make all the flavor made the time go fast waiting for the food. It did come surprisingly fast with the full house. Put for some reason whenever your hungry your stomach likes to make it feel so much slower.

Our waitress was friendly and didn't seem rushed thou it was crazy busy. They had extra hands just to clear tables and fill waters. We all got the Scrambler. You can get bacon, sausage or ham in the eggs. There is potatoes under the eggs, topped with cheese and gravy with a side of toast. If you want you can ask to have the gravy on the side. Huge portions for everything. The gravy wasn't very rich in flavor and on the more runny side. I always end up eating my eggs with ketchup anyway. Pure comfort food right there! Shared a side of Hash and Buttermilk Pancakes. The Hash had an excellent smokey flavor. The pancakes were huge. Had great buttermilk flavor but on the denser side. But im just think that was because we had so much food and it all came at once that they just sat there densing up. Hopefully that was the case.

Overall my stomach hates me. My wallet loves me. Will be back to explore the menu. The Cinnamon Roll looked gooey divine.

CASH ONLY!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't ever understood what people love so much about Mickies.  Sure it's super cheap, and sure they give big portions.  But, I tend to like my food to TASTE GOOD.  I tend to like my bacon NOT to taste like metal, and my pancakes to be less flour-y and dry and have some actual flavor.

I'd rather go almost anywhere else for breakfast."}
{"text":"After always hearing about having to eat here, I left with an omelette in a to-go box and a lost appetite. It's not a bad place if you like seeing mice running around in the open while you eat."}
{"text":"We avoided the Saturday Badger crowds, but even on Friday morning, Mickies Dairy Bar was packed. There's no waiting list or anything, so you just gotta keep your eye on the prize, and hover with purpose. There seemed to be a pretty quick turnover though, so the four of us were able to get a table before too long. The place is fairly small, with a long, U-shaped counter space in the middle, and tables lining the perimeter, with waitresses darting in and out serving their charges. Lots of history adorn the walls, lending Mickies the air of the quintessential diner.

As we sat down and ordered coffee, we talked a bit with our friendly server who explained a few of the offerings to us. We didn't peruse the menu very long before we had all settled on the Scrambler: A plate-sized bed of potatoes piled high with eggs scrambled with your choice of meat, all smothered with cheddar cheese and cream gravy, with toast on the side. Two of us went for sausage, two for bacon, and based on our server's recommendation, we got a side of corned beef hash as well. When our mounds of diner breakfast glory came out, we couldn't believe we had ordered extra, but that hash was actually the surprise hit. The large potato quotient in the Scrambler could get a little bland in spots, but we all agreed that if you chose the hash as part of your Scrambler, it might just be breakfast heaven, with its unique hints of chili powder and cumin.

The four of us waddled out of Mickies fully sated, and fueled for an epic day in Madison."}
{"text":"It IS as good as everyone says! Especially those heavenly pancakes! There's more to this place than just the tradition, the food really is great. I have had the red fish sandwich, BLT, corned beef, Reuben, burger, strawberry pancakes, banana pancakes and cheese curds. Everything is delicious and you get your food FAST."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here with some UW friends before we drove back to Illinois because they hyped it up quite a bit. Boy, did it live up to the hype! It's definitely a no-frills place, but when the food and service are so good you really don't need any other bells and whistles.

Ordered a scrambler with corned beef. It was awesome and the portion was huge! It was literally enough food for 3 meals. The price was well worth it and service was quick and friendly. The huge pile of leftovers I had still tasted good for dinner that day!

Would recommend this place if you're looking for a good breakfast in Madison! I heard it gets pretty busy a lot of the time, but if you can get a spot it's worth it!"}
{"text":"So I love the food here.  I do.  I give it TWO full stars for food.  However, the other three they lose come from lack of service and organization.

You come in and wait in a hoard of persons vying for a table.  The line usually splits in two so it is the luck of the draw as to whether you get seated before the people who were five behind you in line.  It would be so simple (and probably quicker) to have someone directing people.  It is terrible enough that it loses three stars.  Perhaps that is not a breaking point for other people, but essentially stalking people while they eat is not my cup of tea.

The space in there is terrible.  You can not fit between tables, let alone in the winter with a coat on.  People bring strollers in to the restaurant creating blockages and tripping hazards.  None of this ok.  If you are going to have a diner as packed as the Dairy Bar, please prohibit strollers.  Callous?  Perhaps, a little.  However, it brings down your liability when someone will inevitably trip and fall.

The food is great.  Affordable, delicious and huge portions.  One portion is enough to feed two people (maybe three).  The food is hot and it is served quickly.  I was impressed that when I ordered scrambled eggs they came out fluffy.  In the restaurant business, eggs are generally the make or break point.  They are sometimes burned, some flat, sometimes just plain inedible.  Mickies is great when you want to grab a quick breakfast and just hang out for the day.

Avoid this place like the plague if you are there on the day of a football game.  It is a stone's throw from Camp Randall and as you can imagine packed with a sea of red.  

Overall, Mickies is not to be missed.  However, leave everything but your wallet in the car.  And wear comfortable shoes because it is going to be a long wait."}
{"text":"I don''t understand (and never have) what the fuss is all about.  This place has always been talked up as the zenith of cheap, delicious breakfast.

Cheap?  Yes.
Delicious?  No.

There are so many diners in Madison where you can get a cheap breakfast that actually TASTES GOOD.  Everything there is too greasy and under-seasoned.  How do you manage to screw up eggs scrambled with cheese??  Their pancakes are bigger than dinner plates, but they're thick and dry and almost inedible.  I've given this place more than 3 tries and I come out disappointed every time."}
{"text":"This is one of my fiancee's and my favorite places in Madison. The only downside is that you have to pay cash. All the food we've gotten is great. I love the chili and cheese omelet, my fiancee loves the scramblers, and the pancakes are great. Also, you have to try the coffee shake with chocolate syrup added - seriously to die for.

The other thing to consider is the seating - if you come during the \"peak\" hours, expect a wait and be ready to pounce on any open seats. I like to come right about 1 - most people have cleared out by then."}
{"text":"My experience with this place was it was a helluva good deal, tasty and greasy, but a TAD (just a tad) overrated.  But they called their hash browns \"yanks\", or at least they used to, which gives them bonus points."}
{"text":"This is everything a great greasy spoon diner should be.
Good, cheap, and extremely filling food in a well worn atmosphere.
I am always surprised by those who have spent considerable time in Madison and have never eaten at Mickies at least once. It breaks my heart.  Even if the food isn't totally up your alley it is an experience you must take in.  Mickies is living history.  There aren't many places like this around anymore. At least none that are this authentic.  It comforts me to think that this place is about the same as it has been for 50+ years and that it will likely continue to be exactly the same for another 50.
Now specifically about the food. Everyone lauds the pancakes.  All you'll need is one and they come in an array of varieties.  The coffee cake is also stellar.  And I agree with others who lament that the omlettes and yanks are sometimes lacking in flavor, but hey, that's what salt and pepper is for. But for my money, the best thing on the menu is the scrambler. Especially if you just finished a night of hard drinking and/or you have a day of hard drinking ahead.  And go ahead...get it with the gravy.  That's the most illogical and thus delicious part."}
{"text":"Ok, if you're going to Mickies during the weekend, be prepared to wait. In line. Out the door. Needless to say, do not go here on a gameday. You will wait way to long to eat and not be a happy fan after that experience. BUT it is well worth the wait!

Get the Scrambler. Grilled potatoes, piled with eggs and your choice of meat and topped with gravy. You can also ask for the gravy on the side, which I always do.

This was the first restaurant I missed after moving away from Madison after school. Gotta love the bang for the buck!"}
{"text":"I have 1 word for you: Scrambler!
This place is great. A tucked in little \"old time\" cafe. some of the best big plate breakfast choices you will find in the Madison area. I always get the signature breakfast item, the Scrambler.
 It is multiple eggs combined with your choice of 1 item (or more for extra) including but not limited to, sausage, bacon, peppers, onion, mushroom....you name it pretty much and they will throw it in this fantastic concoction. All this on top of yanks (sliced soft potato's) covered is brown breakfast gravy and a ton of cheese!!!!!!!!! With bread.
A ton of cheese, yes please!!!!!!!!!!
A word to the wise, prepare yourself for a wait to sit down on the weekend, and football season is mad crazy since this little cafe is next to Camp Randall. On the week day, you should be just fine getting a decent booth seat.
 Fast service all the time, even when they are packed full. 
If your in Madison, you have to hit this place up for Breakfast!"}
{"text":"Yuck!  Limp, cold toast, limp, cold bacon!  Not my idea of a BLT!  My husband's eggs and sausage weren't much better.  The coffee was barely drinkable.  When we nicely complained, we got the bum's rush.  Huge disappointment after all the hype."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. Such good food. Seating is crowded but the staff are incredibly friendly. Favorite place for breakfast. Would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Mickie's, I've been waiting so long for the perfect time to return to you! And this morning was it! We got scramblers and they're too good for words. That might be because they have what could quite possibly be a whole bag of cheese dumped on top of each one... But hey, it's Wisconsin, we're cool with it. Our server was so sweet and our food came promptly despite the crowd. This place's diner feel and homey food always has me coming back for more! Mickie's, you're cute, I love you."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in town I always visit Mickie's. Always a great place for breakfast in the morning. Go early to avoid the long line wait though."}
{"text":"Large portions! Especially the scrambler the pancakes were good very large good selection of sandwiches also. They only accept cash. Go at an off time so you don't have to wait in line. Good shakes and the waiters are friendly. Nice cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"I want to break out into song, by Toni Basil, Oh Mickie You're So fine.....but I won't (and you're welcome for that earworm).  

I LOVE MICKIES! I wish I lived down the street from a place like this! FRESH DELICIOUS BREAKFAST and FANTASTICALLY FRIENDLY STAFF!!! I normally ding a review for payment limitations, because they don't accept credit cards, but everything else was so amazing, I am giving them 5 stars! So there! :)

It is a Seat yourself place. Best time to go during the week, mid morning. They serve Breakfast till 3pm for late risers.

Eggs - cooked perfectly to order, scrambled (fluffy and creamy), over easy (tender whites with a yummy runny yoke), and omelet - soft blanket of eggs that hugs the ingredients you choose to add...plenty of ingredients to choose from, including a hearty chili.

Toast - two slices cut into diamonds - good, standard toast. Room temperature butter, so you don't shred the toast while spreading the butter - love that!

Pancake - I think one pancake weighs almost 1 lb! It was good cooked thoroughly and it was moist and not overdone at all.

Bacon - GOOD midwestern bacon - crispy and chewy and plenty in a side!

Corned Beef Hash - there is something they do that makes it wickedly good and spicy. I normally wouldn't have shared, because I cherish my breakfast meat, but they give you a half of plate full which was about 3 lbs?? Again, perfectly cooked...some browned edges and it was moist and delicious.

Most of my family got to-go containers because there was just so much food.

Again, they don't accept credit cards, but it is worth all the cash you might have. Mickies is a MUST and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A Madison favorite, spitting distance from Camp Randall. My favorite is the Ruben omelette. Great coffee."}
{"text":"Get...
- a milkshake (a good, old fashioned milkshake, not something you'd get at culverts) 
- the griddle pancake (I don't even like pancakes, but these are the bomb diggity!)
...and you'll love this place. 

The scrambler and the omelettes are alright, average diner food. Their sweet potato fries are just ok as well, but the fact that Mickey's serves sweet potato fries at all is at least a step in the right direction."}
{"text":"I finally decided to visit this local favorite, and I was lucky enough to be seated right away. During warmer months, expect a long line out the door though!

The place is cash only, but they have an ATM machine. Their menu is simple to navigate, but they have a lot of choices. Some notable items are their french toast (which is made out of cinnamon rolls instead of white bread), scramblers (gigantic mixtures of scrambled eggs, breakfast meat, fried potatoes, cheese, and gravy if you want it), and the cornmeal pancake (think corn bread cooked like a pancake).

I got the chili cheese omelette with \"yanks\" which are their fried potatoes. For $7.50, I got a probably 3 potatoes worth of yanks, and an omelette topped with chili, shredded cheddar, and american cheese sauce with 2 slices of toast. It was a lot of food. I saw a lot of people taking leftover omelettes and scramblers in take out boxes, so I was proud of myself for being able to finish the whole thing.

I should probably talk about the service: It was friendly, fast, and helpful. They were quick to help me decide on what to order, and they were able to explain all their menu items and point out their unique dishes.

Overall, I had a great experience. The food was good and cheap and the atmosphere was loud but homey. While I had a great time, I just can't give Mickies an honest 5 stars because I can't confidently say that this is one of the best diners I've been to food-wise. The food was interesting and pretty good, but I didn't find it to be as refined as some other diners I've been to in the past few years. For example, the french toast made of cinnamon rolls was pretty good, but I found it to be too eggy and dense and not fluffy at all. It was like eating scrambled eggs with cinnamon rolls inside. Still, Mickies is a great place to eat breakfast. If you live in Madison, this should be on your bucket list."}
{"text":"Old time charm and the best milkshakes in Madison!"}
{"text":"Restaurants should be judged against what they're trying to do, not against Tavern on the Green in NYC no matter what restaurant it is.

This is a breakfast place in a college town.  It's a ton of food for very little money, and the perfect cure for a hangover.  If you're looking for haute cuisine, this ain't it.

The pancakes are overwhelming in size and portion, the scramblers are famous, and any meal there can feed two over-30 adults.  Great malts, great 50s diner atmosphere, and long lines on weekend mornings.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Excellent tasting, greasy spoon, breakfast with large portions and cheap prices.

They don't take cards but do have an ATM on site.

If you're coming with a group larger than two, or on a weekend morning, you may be waiting for 5-20 minutes to be seated.

The \"Scrambler\" will leave even your largest lineman satisfied!"}
{"text":"All five stars and if I can do more I would. Food is always great friendly staff and I honestly don't think I've been to a restaurant that was almost perfect with their food every single time with the amount of times I've been there! Chilly cheese omelet is my favorite, steak and eggs and you can't go wrong with the scrambler!"}
{"text":"Mickies Dairy Bar is a small diner that happens to be very popular.  My first time visiting Mickies on a random Saturday, there was a small line outside of the door.  The good thing is that my party of 2 did not have to wait longer than 10 minutes.  

As soon as I saw the menu, the first thing that came out of my mouth was, \"Wow, this place is cheap\".  I couldn't believe that a grilled cheese sandwich was only $2.50.  I live in Dallas, and grilled cheeses in Dallas can easily go for $10-12.  I was so excited about all of the options, so we ordered a lot of things.  We started off with Cheese Curds, which I hear are a must in Wisconsin.  I had never had a cheese curd, nor did I know what they were, but I am so glad I was introduced to them.  They are fried balls of cheese, also known as, fried balls of goodness.  The cheese curds are a necessity to start any meal off here!

We then ordered 2 Blueberry Pancakes and a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich to share.  The blueberry pancakes were huge.  1 pancake could have easily been a full sized meal for one person.  I couldn't believe how big and thick they were.  The blueberries were sweet and delicious; however, the pancakes were a bit too thick for my liking.

The Bacon, Egg, and Cheese on wheat toast was bland and not worth eating.  The sandwich was just dry.  But, the potatoes and cheese that accompanied the sandwich were outstanding.  The potatoes were seasoned wonderfully and were some of the best I've ever had.

The portion sizes are huge at this place.  You can easily get full at a low price, while still leaving happy.  I would like to come back and try one of their omelets...of course, with a side of cheese curds!"}
{"text":"Great price, great hangover food.  Eggs, potatoes and enough grease to suck up the nasties leftover from the night before.  The service was pretty decent too.  Not too much ambience, but its cool anyway because I think its the same as it was when it was opened years before (50s?)."}
{"text":"Wow. Really out of date interior. NOT expecting a huge menu on the wall to order off of. It looks like NOTHING has been changed or removed since the 1960s. BUT. BUT, the food is great!! Seems like a locals hot spot for sure:)"}
{"text":"Our first time eating here. The food was great....huge portions. Fantastic service. And the prices are outstanding."}
{"text":"When we first drove up there was a line almost around the block. We had heard the food was delicious and decided to wait in the long line; it went by fast and was so worth the wait! Food and service were wonderful!"}
{"text":"Banana nut pancakes were huge...should have ordered just one (and I am a big man - 6'4\").  Loved the cinnamon rolls, which had the perfect amount of frosting and were fresh and warm. ..perfect with the cup of joe.  My wife had an omelette made to order...not too bad.  The home fries were a bit heavy and \"mealy\" - I like mine crispy on the outside.  Overall, a great amount of good food for the dollar."}
{"text":"I'm awfully glad I chose this culinary Madison landmark for my first breakfast out here. I did this on a Saturday morning which happened to be homecoming weekend, and the place is a stone's throw from the stadium. There was a short line when I arrived, but I was whisked in and plopped down at the one free seat at the counter. (Sometimes it pays to be a lone ranger diner.) I fell in love immediately with the claustrophobic comfort and old school decor of the place. Menus on the walls for all meals of the day. Prices are old school, too. Hearty breakfast  for under $10.00, and lunch specials in the same range.

I'm a huge breakfast fan, especially the big weekend kind. The breakfast menu is extensive with the usual egg choices, omelets, and scrambles which to me resemble what I am used to as a skillet, minus the actual skillet. Thickest pancakes I've ever seen (the guy next to me had) and special 80-year-old recipe coffee cake, made with blueberries or on my visit, rhubarb. I chose a scramble with sausage and cheese. You can add as many ingredients as you like. Service was very fast, and my server was just the perfect diner server: outgoing, helpful and conversational. Although she did not call me \"sweety\" or \"honey\", something you often get in diner. Have to get my shooga elsewhere!

In summary, a very traditional and unique local diner, the likes of which you will not see anywhere else. But it did remind me a bit of a couple if famous place in Chicago, Valois or Lou  Mitchell's, having the same historical value. I look forward to trying the lunch offerings soon."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck!! We had a ginormous breakfast for 3 that was also delicious for under $20. You can't beat it. 

I had the French toast which is 2 cinnamon rolls cut in half and dipped in egg-DELICIOUS!! My husband had the chili cheese omelet with yanks (home fries) and devoured the whole thing. Our son had the kids breakfast and loved every bite.

The decor and feeling of place is a delightful mix of a quaint soda shoppe mixed and your grandmas living room. The service was great and we will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Very old fashioned restaurant and so cute! Very cheap food but very busy atmosphere for Saturday at noon. I got the chocolate chip pancakes which were unlike any pancakes I've had before. I personally didn't like them because they were almost like cake batter. The chocolate malt is definitely the best malt I've had and very filling!y boyfriend got a ham and sausage scrambler and that was so good! The gravy is very good with the potatoes. Definitely will be back to try out more stuff!!!"}
{"text":"what a place...

had sky high expectations.. that were totally exceeded. the griddle cakes are da bomb diggity. every bite had a morsel of apple or raisin hidden inside. i'm not sure if i should admit this publicly, but i actually finished my FULL portion of those damn good 'cakes. i ate ~ 2/3 while at the restaurant BUT due to fear of being judged by my pal and the waiter (\"wow, you're making some good progress over here\") opted to leave a few bites on my plate... which i packed in a take-out pack and gobbled up when i got home! so yes, folks, i managed to down BOTH griddle cakes... there may have been some regret after (belly full of bricks for last 8hours) but what a meal...."}
{"text":"I've only been here one time and it was a really cool experience. I went before a badger game so it was packed. I was apart of a big group and we still got our food with an reasonable time. It was loud in there, it didn't bother me but it may bother some. Also this place only takes cash so be prepared."}
{"text":"If you want to time travel a bit, put Mickies on your list. Just make sure you get there early, because this Madison institution often has a line out the door. 

There's not a whole lot that's changed about Mickies since it opened in the 40s; the booths and counter look original, and the prices are still quite low (though they have gone up considerably from the original menu board offering breakfasts from 20-50 cents). 

Things I can pretty much guarantee:
- it'll be busy
- you'll leave full
- your items will be made fresh and won't come from a container
- you won't regret the milkshake you just ordered with your breakfast

I'm serious about that last point - this is the only place where it feels right to enjoy a creamy blend of milk and ice cream along with your bacon and eggs. 

There's a reason Mickies has been open continuously for nearly 60 years; go see why for yourself."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. A favorite from college.  Right across the street from Camp Randall."}
{"text":"As good as this sort of thing goes. Classic greasy spoon, enormous portions, perfectly good old-fashioned diner food. Super pleasant service. The only real knock is that it's sort of loud and tight and thus not all that comfortable. 

If you go on a weekend with a large group, prepare to wait. Seems like it's best approached for weekend breakfast/brunch either solo or two to three people."}
{"text":"I have only been to this place one other time and I don't really remember that visit.  What I do remember is that it was crowded, it had long wait times, and they only accepted cash.  Five years later and none of that has changed.  

I am simply not a fan of this place.  Upon walking in I was told the wait would be about ten minutes.  This doesn't seem too long until you realize that you are waiting those ten minutes shoulder to shoulder with people in their extremely small front waiting area with lovely freezing air blowing on you whenever the door opens.  When we finally got a table, I realized that it was sandwiched between another set of diners. I usually don't mind this but for some reason today I just couldn't deal with it. The man must hv noticed this because he saw two open seats at the bar and suggested we sit there instead; at this I gladly obliged.

There aren't individual menus outside of a huge menu on the wall.  I ordered the scramble with corn beef hash and onion; gravy on the side and no cheese.  It was not good.  The hot sauce that I drowned it in gave it all the flavor that the dish lacked; not a good sign.  The man ordered the corn beef and blueberry pancake. The corn beef was tasty but was unlike any corned beef I had ever seen.  The pancakes were way too sweet and seriously just too big.


All the things that I mentioned: cash only, small, and portion size are all things that people seem to really like about this place. Not me.  I prefer to use my card and a bit more of a modern setting. If I can't have that I at least want a place that serves good food and not supposed charm.  I will not be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"Classic diner vibes with humongous pancakes and scramblers. It's a UW-Madison classic, so people flock for breakfast on game days and weekends in general. You are almost always guaranteed a wait out the door given the popularity. 

The interior boasts a cool, retro atmosphere and good service. The crowd is always lively too. I love the strawberry pancakes, but can never finish more than half. Oh well, they make good leftovers! 

It's like a little piece of history, so it's worth a visit! Oh, and don't forget that they only accept cash!"}
{"text":"Lots and lots of stick to your ribs, good food. You won't just leave, you will leave stuffed."}
{"text":"If you love diner breakfasts, this place is a MUST. I'm gluten-free, so I can't enjoy the amazing looking coffee cakes and pancakes, but the scrambles and potatoes were plenty. The coffee is delicious. Great service. I didn't get to try a milkshake this trip, but it is on my \"to-do\" list for next time. We went early and on very cold weekdays, so never had a wait, but I can see where this place would get packed, but I would still wait for breakfast..so good!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool! James my 10 year old and I stopped here for pancakes and they were just yummy!  Atmosphere is very old school cafe with red stools and checkerboard flooring.. The menu is on boards over the pick up area in the kitchen.  Our waitress Stephanie was quick and super friendly.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Haute cuisine, you seek?  Keep moving.  This iconic diner has managed to keep prices within reason, while maintaining the original atmosphere and food quality.  The scratch oatmeal which I enjoyed here as a child has long been absent, but many \"signature items\" such as \"The Scrambler\" maintain the original identity.  If the lack of healthy options make you skittish, the token side salad should likely ease your guilt as you enjoy the ample corned beef hash.  Best time to go is early in the week for breakfast."}
{"text":"Ok, my 2 star review is based solely on the food, specifically the pancakes.  As has been mentioned, they are ginormous.  They are very thick, and neither fluffy nor light.  I got whole grain pancakes and maybe that had something to do with it, but my kid's pancake was not that great either.  That said, if I was rating on other criteria:

Service - 4.5 stars.  Another review mentioned a problem w/ coffee refills.  Mine was refilled constantly, after 2-3 sips!  Maybe because we were next to the coffee station?  Service would be 5 stars in my kids' eyes since after they cleared off (ate!) the whipped cream from their pancakes the waitress came around and asked \"need more whipped cream?\"

Price - 5 stars (neglecting that the food was not great).  \"Kiddie Breakfast\" for $4 = Pancake, egg, juice, and 2 pieces of bacon or sausage!  (This would feed most adults).

I don't like giving low ratings to locally owned places run by nice people but this place is an institution and won't suffer from this review... worth a try if you're looking for a ton of food cheap and maybe get something besides the pancakes (and go when they're not busy)."}
{"text":"I like the scramblers here.  They give huge portions so it's worth the money.  The only things I don't like is how small the place is so it's impossible to find a place to sit, and that they don't take credit cards.  Worth going though...after all, they did feature this place on ESPN."}
{"text":"Before this past Saturday, I have never waited outside of Mickies and have considered myself extremely fortunate.  During my last trip, our group had to wait for about 10 minutes.  Our table was crammed up to the radiator next to the main window.  There were people bumping into us everywhere.  I LOVE MICKIES!

Our service has been prompt in the past.  During this trips \"swamped\" time, our service was not slacked at all.  Our waitress (who my wife and I have had several times before) was legitimately happy to see us and kept our drinks filled the entire time despite the hectic population.

For breakfast (though it was lunch time, I can not live without breakfast) the Scrambler is king.  Do it any way you want.  You can not lose at Mickies.  As long as this cornerstone of Madison is here, I will be a happy patron."}
{"text":"Get the scrambler with sausage. Great Breakfast joint. and a really nice meal before a Badger Football game."}
{"text":"Sensory Overload. 

Sunday Fundays should be started with food similar to what is on the menu at Mickies Dairy Bar. I woke last Sunday morning with a wee-bit of a headache, a dog breathing in my face, and my friends waking me telling me to get up for breakfast.
As someone who doesn't say no go greasy eggs and potatoes, I was all in.

My friends were veterans to the Mickies Dairy Bar scene. Me, being the newbie had no idea I was walking into shoulder-to-shoulder breakfast goers. We hunched around a table like a pack of wolves about to descend on some prey. As soon as the people got up from their table, game on. 

Our server was great. She arrived promptly, and never let my coffee get empty. No errors in our order either, and my friend's order was pretty fine-tuned/precise (she's a bit of a princess). Our food came out hot and plentiful.

I ordered the scrambler, aka a heart attack on a platter, and ate about a 1/3 of it. The eggs were good, but the potatoes were mushy and lacking in flavor. I tried adding hot sauce, as well as salt and pepper but it was still lacking in flavor. 

If hangover food is what you are looking for, this is your place. There is a lot of food, but from I tried, it is lacking in flavor. Would I come here again? Yes, if you are looking for greasy-spoon type food, but not if I was looking for a more flavorful classier breakfast.

It is loud. It is red and white. It is Wisconsin."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try Mickies for a while now but the weekend crowds - visible as a line out the door - have kept me away. Now that I made it, I see what the magic is - cheap, straightforward diner meal with all the comfort of someplace unique and local and a solid cup of dark coffee. Your food isn't going to be that much different than a Denny's but the vibe and service make it much more enjoyable. Loved the build-your-own omelette and the old school mannerisms of our server. If you've been watching too much Twin Peaks and have to get your diner fix, only 3 spots in town will cut it - the Curve, Willalbys, or right here at Mickie's Dairy Bar. 

Unless you truly love crowds, save your trip for a weekday."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch place in Madison! Has the best coffee in the world! The scarmbler is very tasty and large portion. It is always crowded on weekends"}
{"text":"Given name by a student. Sat at the counter. In a nutshell, the scrambler was awesome and I couldn't finish mine. Cash only but worth the stop at the ATM prior to waiting in the quick moving line outside."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to visit Mickie's when I was in Madison visiting my girlfriend. I like the old school 1950's lunch-counter vibe. The portions are huge and the food taste like its prepared from scratch. That being said, it's just \"ok.\" I'm sure I'll get a lot of hate for that statement, but its true. If you can't get into Mickie's (its a small restaurant, so the wait time can be pretty long), try Ella's Deli. That place has good breakfast too and a ton of character."}
{"text":"I had to check this place out after seeing it featured on home games on ESPN. Hard to believe that when I was a freshman at The Regent over 25 years ago, this place was right around the corner, and I never went there. As a lost kid from Hawaii, I literally thought this place only served milk and ice cream. Not my favorite things in life so I never ventured in.
On a recent trip back to Madison (first in 14 years), my buddy picked me up at Dane County Airport and we made a bee line to this place. It's not a small place but it was crowded with folks standing against the wall waiting for people to leave the counter. Luckily, we just beat the crowd and were seated quickly. We went over the menu and I decided on the chili cheese omelette. The gal next to me was nice enough to warn me how big the portions were. Our waitress was busier than a one legged man in an ass kicking contest but she was cool, collected and patient with us as we asked questions. 
The food arrives and it is HUGE! Not Cracker Barrel huge but for $7 it was large and in charge. Usually when servings are this big, it's to make up for a lack of quality. Well, the chili was excellent and the omelette was done just right. Fluffy and not overcooked. Coffee was also pleasantly good. Not the usually weak as tea stuff you usually get from diners.
Overall, this place is a gem. Staff was awesome, clientele (mostly hungry students) made me nostalgic for my old college days. Next time I'm back in Madison, I'll have to come back and try something new.My only regret, I should have bought a shirt..."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place after seeing good reviews on Yelp. It's a Madison classic and we heard the pancakes and the scramble were musts. The hubs and I shared one of each. The blueberry cake was as big as a dinner plate and very thick and dense. The flavor was quite good but because of how dense it was it was a bit doughy inside. We ordered our scramble with bacon and cheddar. The potatoes on the bottom are home fry style and very tasty. The bacon comes in whole slices, not chopped and my husband disliked it because he felt it was underdone. I don't disagree with that, it could have been cooked a bit more but it was so smokey that it overpowered the entire scramble. I love smoked meats but this was so harsh I couldn't eat it.  The gravy wasn't Southern creamy style it was a light brown pan gravy and very good. We couldn't even eat half the pancake between the two of us and barely nibbled at the scramble for the reasons described above. The coffee tastes, as my husband said, like it had been brewed it a lot that hadn't been cleaned since 1864. Ok, a bit of an exaggeration but if you cherish really good coffee, pass on Mickie's. It's a hopping hot spot, old-fashioned/nostalgic, small and crowded. I liked all of that. But, based on the food alone, this will be our last visit. Friendly waitress!!"}
{"text":"It's just okay. I think this place is definitely over-rated, but if you want that whole 50's diner experience this is the place to go in Madison! I'll have to say that for the portions you get, it's worth the money. Quality of the food was alright. I've had better for the same price on Willy Street or even down the street at Bluephies. 

It's definitely just a nice environment, but do not go on game days - it's too hectic. AND BRING CASH. They have an ATM there, but we all know how those evil dollar stealers are."}
{"text":"The Scramblerrrrr...........Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
The buttermilk pancake........Ooohhhhhhhhhh
The prices......ummm, did I even pay?"}
{"text":"This place is awesome sauce! We take troops from Chicago to the Delis and make sure too stop here in Madison at this spot.  Usually at 630a - it's packed.  Its definitely a local favorite spot.  The prices are unbelievable.  The service is GREAT. The food is delicious home cooking.  I've been here several times and I have ordered several different items and been pleased with all.  Whatever you pick you will be winning.  Only bad thing? Good luck finding parking. 
See you again soon!"}
{"text":"I could write a review with just three words....and they would be: Try the scrambler. 

But alas, I'm honest and have to say I've really never had the scrambler at Mickies. Oh I've seen plenty of them but I always chose to order their delicious pancakes instead. So, on that note, order pancakes. Any flavor will do, they are all incredible. Special attention should be paid to their pumpkin variety when in season. 

As others have said, the food is quite affordable, service very sweet (a la your grandmother's kitchen) and man it can get crowded on the weekends. And if you're feeling really great one day, definitely get a milkshake. Mmmmm."}
{"text":"Great dive and local place to experience.  Ordered the omelet...eh...nothing spectacular and wouldn't order it again. Hubs had the scrambler which was a lot better. A plentiful mixture of whatever you want scrambled together. Also had the strawberry pancake which was delicious. Warning: not fresh strawberries, but nonetheless good. Overall, service was outstanding. Waitress was very helpful, friendly, fast...everything you want. Downside - CASH ONLY! No ATM on the inside either."}
{"text":"I came here with the BF for breakfast and was expecting the worst since I'm not really a fan of these counter style breakfast places where everyone seats themselves and are packed in like sardines. When we got there it was utter chaos but the gods must have been watching over us because we spotted a hidden empty table and sat down immediately (much to the dismay of the other people who were waiting and didn't see the table bwahahaha). Our waitress was super friendly and reminded me of Sarah Palin (I didn't hold that against her). The BF ordered the Scrambler with bacon and sausage with a small glass of chocolate milk. I was shocked by how much food that was and was even more shocked by how delicious it turned out. I got the blueberry pancakes with a side of sausage and home fries. These were the biggest, most dense pancakes ever. I was very proud that I was able to almost finish one of those beasts. I took the rest to go and enjoyed them later as a post breakfast/pre lunch snack. All in all we were both very pleased by our meal and the price was very reasonable considering how much food we got."}
{"text":"I've heard a ton about Mickies since I've moved to Madison, and I'm glad i finally got to try it out! It's an old-styled diner, and fairly cheap for the huge portions. I highly recommend trying out the Scrambler, which is basically just a huge mixed portion of breakfast foods. I've never seen anything like it before in any brunch diner, so that was really unique! I personally got French Toast topped with strawberries, which was delicious!

It's always pretty busy - I went at 11 AM on a pretty snowy day, and I got one of the last booths available. I would always expect a bit of a wait if you're going around brunch time, but I think it's well worth it. Perhaps with a few more visits, I would be able to put this at 5 stars! 

Finally, I've heard their shakes are amazing, so I would certainly try them out if you're a fan of shakes! Would definitely recommend trying it out if you're in town and want a quick brunch!"}
{"text":"Ah, the coffee cake!! I miss the blueberry coffee cake so bad .. I haven't had it in a while. You can taste the \"home-made\" and \"they know what they're doing\" in the coffee cake. 

I've also eaten breakfast there. I had a giant oriental omelet with \"yankee\" (hash brown type of thing) on the side. As it was suggested, I had the omelet with soy-sauce ... it makes sense with the \"oriental omelet,\" right? So right. I loved it. My friend's gynormous  pancake was moist and fluffy and delicious, too. Both of us couldn't finish our meal, so we the took the rest of it home. 

If you plan to be there on a weekend morning, go early, otherwise bunch of hung overs like yourselves are going to be there and the wait can be pretty long."}
{"text":"Mickies used to be one of my favorite places in the world to eat. I used to go multiple times a week. 
Now, the management seems exhausted and not very pleased to see you. The food has gone down in quality, the water cups taste like soap, the coffee is always awful , and on top of that they don't even refill your coffee after two servings. 
You get your check and they expect you to leave...excuse me I'm here for food and a conversation. It would make sense on a game day to get kicked out but not in the summer when there's barely anyone there. Is this a diner? Or just some place that was featured on ESPN, thus leading to management caring less about their locals and regulars. 

I won't be back. I'll go to the curve, pay more, and be happy about it."}
{"text":"The.best.breakfast.in.town.

Thanks bye.

Okay to elaborate a bit - no matter what you order here for breakfast, it's going to be awesome.  And don't look for menu's - the eats are up on the wall, silly.  And it doesn't matter what time of day it is, order a milkshake.  I guarantee you ten dollars it'll be the best one you've ever had (the kind that they serve to you still in the freezing cold tin cup with a big long spoon).

*Tip:  if you are smart you will PLAN to go to Mickie's and you will be there early, and not on a football weekend.  Otherwise you will be standing in line, most likely outside in the cold, for a long, long time.  Take it from me.  -30 degrees on a rumbling, empty stomach in January isn't really that much fun."}
{"text":"Pb milkshake, blueberry pancakes, and the scrambler. All delicious and it was a ton of food!"}
{"text":"Oh Micky your so fine...

Haven't eaten here for a long long time... and most likely this was the first time I wasn't hung over or already had a few to start a big Madison weekend!  

Gotta love this place, pretty much on campus and in the shadows of Camp Randall.  Lots of nostalgia and still great food!  Prices are pretty good too!  

The portions are amazing, be prepared for a take some home.  

Even though I gave it 5 stars there are some drawbacks.  The place is cash only.  It drafty when the door opens, which can be uncomfortable if you are seated by the door and its cold outside.  Parking in the area sucks, and it is extremely loud when the place is busy.  

This is such a neat place that I'm willing to overlook all the issues above just because it's Micky's and it's been around for a long time.  Plus the food us good!"}
{"text":"Read about this place and had to try it. The service was fast and the atmosphere and location were awesome. The food, amongst all four of us, was extremely sub par. Think, ihop in a cool location. Only that's giving it too much credit. It really was blah unfortunately."}
{"text":"You know what? The price is right. That about sums up this place. This establishment continuously makes nationally recognized lists, and don't get me wrong it is an establishment, but sometimes too much hype leaves one aching for something more...If you've never been here before, relax. It's a diner not a Michelin star and your expectations should reflect that! :)

After a hike around the arboretum my fella and I decided we could splurge. We ordered 2 cheeseburgers (standard order comes with lettuce, tomato, american cheese, and pickles), cheese curds, and a vanilla malt. (Total of $19) Cheese curds were great - standard issue, normal serving, but who is going to argue against fried cheese!! The burgers were classic - served medium. I would sub the cheese for Swiss and ask for the bun to be toasted - but that's just me. The \"malt\" however was a low point...it lacked malt flavor, had lots of ice chunks, and was very thin...sorry but at $4.50 they can do better! - The server did give us two plastic cups and spoons - so splitting is not extra.-

I like this place. The old charm makes for a fun dining experience. With that being noted I think the location makes it more popular than if it were elsewhere in the city. But, all that said, if I found myself in walking distance I'd probably wander back in."}
{"text":"Definitely delicious. I love the atmosphere of the diner and the hustle and bustle. The food was great and inexpensive. I'm at Edgewood, so it's really close and easy to get to. It does get crowded on the weekends, so make sure you have enough time. It also gets a little tight and you can end up sitting by strangers. It didn't bother me, but it gets kind of cramped! Overall really awesome place, great Madison feel!"}
{"text":"I always think of Mickies as a must-go place when I am in town, but this time around, I questioned why that is the case.  The food was decidedly mediocre, not cheap and the wait was interminable.  My companion's omelet, ordered with pepperjack cheese, was served with cheddar sprinkled on top.  My mushroom and swiss omelet almost certainly was made with slimy canned mushrooms.  The fried cheese curds - which my every visit to Madison must include - were forgettable, sadly.  Even the coffee was not up to snuff.  At least the waitstaff was friendly and trying hard."}
{"text":"I was here last week with my wife and 1 yr old baby. Waited outside for 10 mins as their wait in line system moves pretty fast, and the patrons inside are very cognizant of people waiting outside to be seated. It's like that they eat, enjoy the food and leave! Very nice people for doing that, and we definitely pay it forward for other customers. 

The Pancakes and Skillets are a MUST have if you come here. I had Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes with a side of bacon and eggs. It was UBER delicious. Pancakes were fluffy and moist, it was made with fresh smashed blueberries, eggs were scrambled just right and the smoked bacon was cooked perfectly.

I had sooo much food, I needed a to-go box, and I ate it later for dinner that same night. It was very delicious for the price. The wait staff was very cool and hip, and they all smile and make you feel at home.

I love this place mucho!"}
{"text":"At the risk of getting killed by everybody else who gave Mickies 4 or 5 stars I just don't think the breakfast here is 
a) worth the wait
b) all that good or special
c) I haven't had many meals here that didn't go right through me

Go to Original House of Pancakes instead."}
{"text":"I'm with Onotse and Kelsi on this one, I just am not a fan. I've been to Mickie's a few times now, trying to give it a few chances to redeem itself in my eyes. Unfortunately, I find the food too greasy and just not that flavorful. I also think the portion sizes are ridiculously large. Normally I like big portions, but I really don't think eggs reheat or keep well as leftovers, so in this case it is a downside.

The atmosphere is a bit crazy, as it's always super busy, and the food simply doesn't impress me. The scrambles and omelets are way too heavy, with what seems like 3-4 eggs, tons of cheese, and a whole ton of grease. Not the way I like to start my day. Everything is oozing cheese and gravy and oil, but none of it really tastes like much. I always have to add black pepper and hot sauce, and it still often tastes like it could use more flavor. The food also in general seems like it's not fresh at all, either coming out of a box or a can and reheated or mixed in with eggs. Even the pancakes aren't that great...really huge but overly cake-y.

I probably won't come back, as there are so many really good breakfast and brunch options in Madison."}
{"text":"Great food.  Huge portions.  Quick service.  Amazing prices.  There is good reason why people line up out the door to get in"}
{"text":"Hmm, wasn't quite a fan.  Perhaps it was the fact that my Reuben omelette was not altogether tasty and neither was my boyfriend's corned beef.  Still, I appreciate the ginormous portions and the cute setting."}
{"text":"Mickie's has AMAZING milk shakes.  Seriously, so good.  Go try their chocolate banana malt right now.

As for their food, it's pretty disgusting.  They give huge portion sizes (always a plus) and for a very reasonable price, but the taste does not make this deal work.  Today I ordered the french toast.  I had eaten their french toast before and thought it was OK, but today they did something different.  They took really gross, cheap cinnamon bread (the kind you pull off a grocery store shelf) and put 4 slices on the grill, then dumped non-seasoned eggs (as in PLAIN eggs) over it.  It was so gross I couldn't eat them.  I won't be eating the food again. 

It's on the dirtier side and there is usually a long wait (for what, I'm not sure -- unless it's the milkshakes).  Lastly, I will add that it's extremely loud.  If you want to go there to talk with friends while you eat, make sure to yell, it's the only way you'll be heard."}
{"text":"I guess I don't get all the hype. 

Yes the portions are large and the food is cheap. But it also just doesn't taste good. 

I got the scrambler, which I guess they're known for. It was a large flavorless mess of overcooked eggs and mushy potatoes. Even after adding the gravy, it was in desperate need of salt and pepper. 

Alternatively, my husband ordered the Cajun Steak Sandwich. (He doesn't breakfast).  It was so over seasoned that it wasn't quite edible. 

So, by all means, if you're hungover, eat here. The food might be better when you're still partially drunk."}
{"text":"the best breakfast you will ever eat.  she gets pretty busy in there, but the scrambler will bring your concept of time, worries, and interal organs to slow stop.  wonderful."}
{"text":"This is a Madison staple and an iconic breakfast place on Monroe Street near Camp Randall. This place is cheap, and you can a lot of food for your money's worth. On the weekends, be prepared to wait in line for at least 20 minutes because it is a hangover cure place. 

The ambiance of Mickey's is an old school diner, and it's cash only. They have the main menu above where the kitchen. Then they also have a menu from the 1950's for a comparison. The service is phenomenal even when it is crazy busy. 

The pancakes are to die for, and they are the size of your plate. Also the scramblers are great and come with a side of toast as well."}
{"text":"Holy tits. I travel a lot for work and I went to this place too late in the week in my opinion. The best French toast. Perfectly cook bacon. The atmosphere is amazing. The waitress was adorable in a northern caring mother sort of way.  Kind of like Marshall's mom from HIMYM. Anyways: 15/5 would devour again."}
{"text":"Easily my favourite breakfast place in Madison. Portions of food are plentiful, staff is friendly, and it's right by Camp Randall. If you get there early enough their cinnamon rolls are. I definitely recommend the scrambler (3 eggs, your choice of ingredients, and breakfast potatoes underneath)."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to Mickies and took the other reviews here in account when we arrived. We went early on a weekday because it is very small and does get easily crowded, so this was a good time to come. We brought cash since credit cards are not accepted (also please note, the ATM next door at Hotel Red does not work very well, so don't rely on it).
My husband ordered the griddle cakes, I ordered the banana nut pancakes, and we shared the yanks with cheddar cheese on top. Neither of us were able to finish our food (this is very very rare for my husband!!). We could only eat one pancake each because they are very dense and cover a full sized dinner plate. We also had coffee which is bottomless and nice and dark just the way I like it. 
Our server was very friendly and visited our table often to make sure we were doing ok.
It is important to keep in mind that this place is not glamorous by any means, but has a nice homey divey retro charm. The food is decent and very generously portioned which I appreciate. We actually ended up eating our left over pancakes for dinner with some sausage, so we literally lived off our breakfast for a day! Awesome. :D
We will definitely be coming back and I would like to try something different each time. I saw on my way out that they also have coffee cake and cinnamon buns which sounds enticing. 
If you're looking for a relaxed atmosphere to eat comfort food with a few good friends on the cheap, this is a good place to check out."}
{"text":"It was Sunday morning (ish) after a long weekend of exploring (drinking) around Madison. The room was full of worn-out (hungover) people, and we were all looking for something to cure us of our ailments before a long drive back to Indy. Mickies was suggested immediately by everyone in the room who knew the area, and we set off for what had been described to me as a must-visit when you are anywhere near Camp Randall. 

The first thing you will likely notice when you approach this establishment is the line of people outside waiting for a table. If you aren't someone who can wait for your food, you better get here early. That being said, unless you are seconds away from keeling over due to excessive hunger you are best off just to wait. The tables get turned over quickly so the wait likely isn't as long as you might first suspect. 

Once you finally do make it in, you quickly get an idea of what this place is all about. It's not big, but they utilize every ounce of space they have. It looks like your stereotypical greasy spoon diner, with a big bar in the middle surrounded by a bunch of booths and tables that are all a little bit closer that put you a little closer to your neighbor than you would like. The hostess was surprisingly nice and organized for how busy it was that morning, and it appeared this was just business as usual. We were seated in a booth and directed to the large menu up on the wall. 

As far as the food goes, this place is the definition of \"you get what you pay for.\" It's what they try to do and you can't possibly fault them for not doing it well. It's a lot of your standard breakfast items at prices that can't be beat. They are served greasy spoon style, so your sweet foods are going to slightly resemble a breakfast item that has been turned into an over the top dessert, your savory foods might actually stop your heart after the first few bites, and everything in between is going to come with enough food to feed a small family. You can easily walk in here with $5 and walk out full. Being a weekend of gluttony already, I opted for what they called the \"scrambler\" which was somewhere around $7 and came with a little bit of everything. Basically, it was a bunch of hash browns, covered with a bunch of eggs, stuffed with a bunch of meats, topped with a bunch of cheese, and covered with a bunch of gravy. They serve that with a health portion of toast and call it a meal. It was the perfect meal for me that morning, and I even struggled to finish half of it. 

This place is what it is. It's a college place in the shadow of one of the best places to watch a football game anywhere in the country. You aren't going to get any culinary masterpieces or unique creations. The flavors don't taste better than anywhere else, and the guy cooking isn't trying to make any fusion dishes to mess with your taste buds. You will, however, get a ton of food for a small amount of money that will hit the spot when you are looking for some comfort food or a sugar rush. If that sounds like something you enjoy, this place needs to be on top of your list.

P.S. Cash only"}
{"text":"This has long been a favorite for me, and is now so for my son as well. Standing order if a buttermilk pancake, bacon, fruit, and OJ for him and it's the perfect size breakfast for a growing boy. Standing order for me is a cornmeal pancake, patty sausage, yanks with onions and jalapenos, and an iced tea. I usually have some left overs, which is fine because it's such an affordable place. It's an old place with TONS of character (some of which is not great...tiny bathroom...). We always try to sit at the counter, but frequently the restaurant is PACKED and you may not have a choice of where to sit. As long as you party isn't too large and the line isn't too long it's probably worth waiting, but good luck on game day. 

When I was working on campus I used to pop in here for lunch about once a week or so and it was always great for lunch as well. Soups were delicious, hearty, and warming on those cold winter days; highly recommended. 

Really I've enjoyed most everything I've had at Mickies and never been there with anyone that felt differently. The one exception may be the french toast, which was VERY eggy. 

It's a 'greasy spoon' in all the right ways. Definitely worth a look!"}
{"text":"Everytime I came to eat here there's always a long line and I was too lazy to wait. Fortunately, today I got seated right away! It's a classic breakfast place and they have the menu on the wall. It's super duper duper cheap and the portion is humongous!!

I had the steak and eggs (I substituted the fries with sweet potato fries) I think the food is just meh. They overcooked both my steak and eggs. The sweet potato fries is not crispy enough. Service was good, our server kept on coming back to check on us although the place is fully packed

My boyfriend had the scrambler and his food was basically buried under a pile of cheese. He said it was just ok, the best part of the scrambler is the potato and gravy. 

Those two food we had + 2 coffee = $20 and we had leftover too. Would I go back for the food? Probably not. I would definitely bring people here for the experience though."}
{"text":"A Madison tradition, particularly for breakfast. Jammed on most mornings, I have to say that their food is only partly worth the wait. Their grill is always too hot in an effort to get food out quickly. As a result, eggs are perpetually almost burned on the outside and uncooked on the inside. This applies to their pancakes and omelets too. However, their coffee and cinnamon roles make up for these problems. So order carefully, and you won't be disappointed. Part of their popularity stems from the fact that they are the only \"real\" breakfast place in town..."}
{"text":"Incredible! Definitely worth the wait in line. Food is incredible and way more than expected! Going back as often as I can!"}
{"text":"Best greasy spoon in downtown Madison.  As many people have noticed, portions are huge and they only take cash and they can be quite busy.  COnsidering how busy they are, I think service is decently fast.  I like the chili cheese omelettes and the pancakes.  The malts are good but I never order them because I can't imagine how bad my stomach would feel after a scrambler AND a malt!"}
{"text":"Huge portion of breakfast/brunch to start a day. Scrambled eggs are my favorite. But too bad they don't accept cards :("}
{"text":"This place is the bar amongst which all breakfast places will have to measure up to.  The scrambler is a beast of a breakfast which has already been touted as a hangover cure in other peoples' reviews.  It's true, I know from experience.  Basically an over-sized meat (of your choice) and cheese omlette over hash-browned potatoes with more pure melted Wisconsin cheese goodness over the top of it all.  Along with a side of gravy, 4 pieces of toast, and a masterpiece milkshake, this meal could maybe even cure cancer.  Too bad you'll have a heart attack right after all the cancer cells wave the white flag.

I never even bother with the pancakes when all you ever need is a scrambler, though I hear they're fantastic and huge.  And the prices are super low too.  This place gets busy on weekend mornings, and rightfully so.  I miss this place, a lot.  I guess I'll just have to suffer here at my new home in Hawaii... suckas!"}
{"text":"Huge portions and cheap prices.  Cash only but an ATM is inside ... really?  The one star ding is for not accepting digital transactions."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness - spoiled spoiled spoiled. This was my first trip to Madison for work (Go Badgers) and I was told by my boss I could not pass up Mickies Dairy Bar. Lucky for me, I have the sleep cycle of a retired grandmother so I was up and ready to eat by 6:00am. I strolled across campus from my hotel and found a quaint restaurant where I wasn't the only person outside taking pictures of the facade of the building. Inside, I had a flashback to the 50s that I never lived in with the old menu price and decor. I sat at the bar and took far too long to order because I wanted to examine my options (aka check out other peoples food). I settled on one griddle cake and a side of bacon as I had a long day of walking ahead. The griddle cake was the size of a toddler bicycle wheel and came along with an apology for taking so long -- which it didn't take long at all. Soon after I arrived, ESPN followed me in to shoot a special on the \"tastes of the town\". I slowed the pace of my eating to be an innocent-background-fat-kid-eating-pancakes bystander (why didn't I order an omelet...) and made friends with the locals just chit chatting. Just the one griddle cake was too much to handle but I wish I could have eaten the strawberry rhubarb cobbler fresh out of the oven steaming with melted butter right in front of my nose. The manager was so nice to explain all of the foreign Wisconsin words and foods and told me about how nuts it got during the day. I could have sat and made friends all day but I decided to scoot and pay my bill (cash only) and wander on my way. A MUST eat if you are in Madison, just arrive early! Thanks for the hospitality."}
{"text":"Sorry, I don't get it.  The food's incredibly cheap, and the portions are unbelievably generous.  And I'm not a snob; I love diner breakfast, and I think the ambience in this place is great.  Love the old-school signs and counter.  But the last time I was there, the breakfast sausage had something nasty and gristly in it.  If the best thing you can say about the food is that there was a truckload of it, not sure that's the best advertisement."}
{"text":"OK, I'm bumping this one up to 4.  Yes, you're still going to have to wait but it is worth it.  On the most recent visit, service was really good in spite of the long line, and, quite honestly, for the price, it's kind of hard to beat it.  Our server this time was very charming and funny and it definitely added to the experience.  If I ate here every week, I would probably die, but for when we are in town, it will continue to be one of our breakfast spots, no matter how long we have to wait!"}
{"text":"I've been in Madison for a while now and have heard people rave of Mickies Dairy Bar every since I got here. I finally got the chance to visit and I can say that it is definitely worth the hype. The inside is very charming and everything is very vintage looking (because it is!). There are a lot of vintage Wisconsin badgers sports memorabilia and photos hanging around. Know before you go that there will likely be a line as this place is always super popular and the inside is not that large, but it is 100% worth the wait. I ordered the banana nut pancakes in addition to toast and two eggs as I was pretty hungry and unsure of what the size of everything would be. Everything was made perfectly and I ended up having to take a box home. The pancakes are huge, fluffy, and super filling and I've been dreaming about them every since, next time I go I may not even need to order any sides. The restaurant in general is super friendly from the decor to the people that work there. Before you order just remember that everything comes in huge sizes! In addition, they only accept cash, but there is a debit machine in the restaurant, and parking might be difficult but not impossible! Great place for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"We were in WIsconsin for a wedding last week and only had one day to spend in Madison. Our very first stop? Mickie's! It's always packed in the mornings with hung over college kids and hot as all get out during the summer. The service is pretty slow and it's usually so noisy you can barely hear yourself think but it's awesome! We had to go in and get a sausage scrambler. The size of the thing is massive and seeing it  helped me understand why I put on so much weight in college :) 

This place is just a Madison landmark and I look forward to many more scramblers in visits to come."}
{"text":"Are you ready for the best corned beef hash of your life? SO GOOD and less than $4!! 

I was recently in the Madison area searching for some good breakfast and Yelp led me to Mickies Dairy Bar. It may not look like much from the outside but there's a reason for the long line out the door. The food here is delicious and cheap, two of my favorite things. 

The corned beef hash comes with eggs and toast, which you really don't need because the hash is the star of the menu in my opinion. The bacon is also crispy and delicious and you can get a side for dirt cheap. My picks for beverages include the fresh-squeezed orange juice and milkshake (we ordered a combo of strawberry and Oreo cookie). All the Yelp reviews rave about the pancakes but I wasn't as impressed. Sure, they're big but I'm all about quality over quantity. 

A huge breakfast for 2 (but we ordered like it was for 3) cost less than $20. Love it."}
{"text":"Such a cute little diner! The menu was on the wall which was really fun. Service was quick and friendly. We would come again."}
{"text":"Madison isn't a diner town, so it's a good thing the one real diner we have is such a good one.  Most of the reviews here are about the breakfast, which is just fine, but (as the Yelp consensus has it) more distinguished by size than by taste.  But the secret of Mickie's is that it's a great place to have lunch -- no lines, especially on weekdays, and you can still order breakfast food if you want.  I like the $3.50 short-order hamburger here better than the $7.95 one at Dottie Dumpling's Dowry.  And their corned beef hash is terrific -- powerfully and interestingly spiced, quite a bit different from the standard formula for this dish.
 
Very friendly to children -- the kids special, a big pancake, a one-egg omelet, bacon, and a drink, is a full meal for $3.95."}
{"text":"Our favorite couple to visit in Madison took us to this amazing place. I don't need to say much more than ermergerd reuben omelette, but I will.

The seating is first come first serve (no hostess), and I bet that can get brutal. However, we went on a Sunday at about 10am and waited about 15-20 minutes. Not bad at all. The place was small, cute, and old-fashioned looking. The service was on point and polite - a huge plus.

Our friends got chocolate shakes, and boy howdy do I regret not getting one. That was the best damn chocolate shake my lips have touched, and I used to work at an ice cream place. So hopefully that gives me some credibility. 

The guys got the scrambler, and it looked tasty enough. It was huge, and from what I gathered, it's what the dairy bar is know for. But ignore that, because I hit the jackpot in this story. If you like reubens, you would become absolutely obsessive over their reuben omelette. It had everything you could want: tender corned beef, swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and thousand island. Ate the whole thing. Just get it okay? You get hash browns and toast, too.

This heifer gives Mickey's a thumbs up."}
{"text":"If you don't mind the wait...

Mickey's has very sizable portions of breakfast staples. I've had omelettes, pancakes, and hash browns, and all were inexpensively priced while filling me up before a Badger game or the morning after a night of excessive drinking. The food is your basic greasy spoon fare, and it will be served quickly once you get a seat and order. However, you might wait in line around the block to get a table. If you can't stand for an extended period of time, it is raining heavily, or you don't like being seated shoulder to shoulder, you might want to hit IHOP, Perkins, or Original Pancake House instead. I've had great times at Mickey's, but I've also had the worst dining experience of my life here."}
{"text":"I saw this place on  the TV show College Eats and told myself the next time I was in Madison, I was going there to try their legendary Scrambler.  Recently I was in Madison for my Granddaughter's State Gymnastics Meet so I took the family to Mickies for breakfast.

I was surprised at how small the place was, but we were there early and we got seated immediately.  The staff is very friendly and makes you feel more like a guest than a customer.
They do not have menus at the table, it is on the back wall which made it a little difficult to read from our table since we were at the back of the restaurant, but with the waitress's help everyone quickly got their orders in.  The food was delivered quickly and it was hot.

Needless to say I ordered the Scrambler which is, I guess to be, about two whole pounds of eggs, potatoes, sausage, melted cheese  and gravy. I added bell peppers, onions mushrooms and jalapenos.  With the other ingredients they offer you could probably make this into a three pound creation.  It was cooked perfectly and was delicious. Since I couldn't finish it, I had it for breakfast for the next two days and it was almost as good when reheated.

My wife had the whole wheat pancakes, which were the size of the plate and about 1/2 inch thick.  The bacon was crisp, just the way she likes it.  Probably because of the size of the pancakes, they serve the syrups in juice pictures.

The rest of the family enjoyed their meal as well.

When in Madison, this is one place that is a must stop if you want a good breakfast of natural food well cooked and served in a very friendly environment."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch with nostalgic 50s vibe and prices. A madison treasure!  It was my first visit back to Mickey's in ten years but they maintained the same quality of service and food.  Iconic venue in UW Madison area."}
{"text":"AMAZING! The pancake is the size as your head, but hardly takes a dent out of your wallet. Get there early, otherwise you'll wait for a table. Wish the place was a little bigger, but I also love that it's a small diner."}
{"text":"This is a pancake-enthusiasts heaven, at least in my opinion. The banana nut pancakes are just divine- I've ate a lot of pancakes in my days and these are like my absolute favorite. Dense, moist, delicious. I've had a bit of the scrambler, stolen bites from family members, and that tastes just as amazing as the pancakes. 
Would 100% recommend this place to all Madisonians, Wisconsinites and all Americans, in general. 
Good coffee, good service.
Only thing is- remember cash! 
Mickie's will always be my go-to breakfast place in Madison."}
{"text":"Hefty! Hefty! Hefty! Portions that is.

If you're looking for yummy, cheap food in massive quantities, look no further. Mickies is the place to be.

The pancakes are monstrous!! But they are truthfully delicious. In fact I've been engaging in a scandalous love affair with their chocolate chip pancakes...(and sometimes, though less often, their strawberry pancake)...for the past few months. The relationship is a tough one that's cost me normal blood sugar levels and more importantly, friendships. Eating off the plate of my dear comrades who had themselves ordered the pancake has ultimately led to bitter disputes that never end smoothly. Ah well, the contentment I extract from each forkful of syrup-drenched, melty-chocolate-chip-covered pancake makes up for all the troubles. 

On a more savory note, the corned beef hash is also quite fantastic. Get it alongside 2 sunny up eggs and rye toast and badda-bing, badda-bomb, you've got one killer breakfast for yourself. 

One of my other go-to orders is the steak and eggs with hash browns and onions. Wowza! Now I know I wasn't exactly around in the '50s or nothin, but talk about old school diner food done wayyyy right.
  
Basically, Mickies nails it all. Everything they serve up has got yum written all over it. Be here or be square."}
{"text":"I'm not angry with Mickies, just sorely disappointed.

A group of us came to Mickies after hearing so many great reviews. We were promptly seated by a sweet employee who was willing to accommodate our party of 10. Unfortunately, the service went exponentially downhill from there once we were given a different employee as our server.

1. Our server was not friendly at all. She rushed to gather our order in as quickly as possible--this was understandable considering the morning rush, but it certainly did not make for a welcoming experience.

2. Our server gave us attitude because we pointed out that she gave us the wrong plate order. I was sharing my plate with a friend who is vegetarian; however, the server gave us a plate with sausage and gravy on top. The upsetting part wasn't that she made a mistake, but that she insinuated that WE were wrong when she said \"You ordered second, so you get the second plate.\" (We ordered first, by the way.) After we were able to flag her down to explain that we did not order meat, she realized that she had given our plate to someone else at our table, and expected us to switch the plates after they had already eaten half of their plate! She rolled her eyes and left, without apology, as if WE were burdening her for HER mistake and wanting to get a new, uneaten plate.

3. We went to go pay for our meal and the cashier had charged us for a plate that SOMEONE ELSE in our party had ordered. We pointed this out and, instead of owning up to his mistake, he told us that since someone else had paid for our plate, we had to pay for the other person's more expensive meal. When we told him that we should be paying for the meal that WE ordered, he shrugged us off with the gall to say, \"that's just how it is,\" and made us pay the extra money for the mistake that he made.

We understand that mistakes happen and that things get busy. However, it is NOT unreasonable for us to expect to be treated decently; to not be blamed for wanting the service that we paid for; and for them to simply own up and apologize for your mistakes. I sincerely believe our dining experience could have been considerably better if the employees had simply apologized and owned up to their mistakes. Instead, we left with a guilt trip for the mistakes that were made by their employees and felt incredibly disrespected.

TL;DR: several mistakes were made, no one apologized, they made us pay more than what we ordered"}
{"text":"Great deal. Great service. NEVER go on a homegame day. EVER. No one ever listens to me but I swear that the cornmeal pancakes are some of the best I've ever had. As my boyfriend says, this place serves food that \"sticks to your ribs.\""}
{"text":"Mickey's dairy barn has the best hangover brunch food.  It comes in huge portions and is so delicious, especially the scrambler.  They have a big menu with decent prices, the prices are especially good if you go for lunch and get a burger.  This place is always packed for brunch, especially on football game days."}
{"text":"Madison tradition but nothing great except the shakes.  Breakfast is heavy and not great.  The pancakes are big but doughy and not that great.  The scrambler is the best thing to get.  Don't wait in line for this place."}
{"text":"This cash-only classic is a fantastic find for families visiting Madison! Located steps away from Camp Randall, the football fortress on the campus of the University of Madison, this 50's lunch counter has classic charm and a simple, affordable menu. Pancakes, eggs, cinnamon rolls, coffee cakes, shakes and malts make up the bulk of this menu. A kid's menu also offers smaller portions of adult options. The potions are large, the food is great--classic comfort food served quickly and with a smile--and the restaurant has both stools and booths. You'll need to park in the surrounding neighborhood, and you should be prepared to stand in line to get inside, depending upon what time you arrive. With lines of people waiting to eat, lingering is not an option--but exposing your kids to diner style dining is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Had friends in from out of town last weekend, had to take them to Mickies. Can't come to Madison without at least one meal here.  Food and atmosphere is great.  Breakfast is the best.  Only drawback can be wait, but worth it."}
{"text":"I always make time to visit this place when I'm in Madison.  It's part Old School Big 12 college town grub and part Wisconsin Dairy State throwback.  If you've got the nerve (and the appetite!), order the SCRAMBLER.  It's a bed of fried potatoes covered with scrambled eggs with sausage, covered with gravy and grated cheese.  Subtract five years from your life for each one of these you eat."}
{"text":"Pull up a chair, son and let me tell you about The Scrambler.  It begins, like so many breakfasts do, with a plate of hashbrowns and about four scrambled eggs.  But that's just the start.  Sprinkle those eggs with your choice of meat (bacon, ham, or sausage) and cover the whole thing with cheese.  Wait, you think we're done?  Not yet, boyo.  There's still some sausage gravy to top the whole thing off.  

All this with a milkshake.  Consistently voted best breakfast in the Big Ten, it's the perfect hang-over food."}
{"text":"There's a reason why this place is packed with a line on weekends. It is a lot of food at a great price. The scramblers are the main attraction; they are a heaping omelet-like plate with pan-fried potatoes (aka \"yanks\") and a generous covering of cheese. Cinnamon rolls are a nice addition, but you may not have enough room unless you box up part of your meal. The sandwiches are also pleasant, I don't get them as often, however."}
{"text":"Mickies is really all about a matter of opinion. If you're looking for some down-home diner food, this is for you. And by diner food I mean food that's produced en mass and not necessarily attended to for quality. and service that's rushed because the place is always full to the brim. Portions are big, prices are good.
...matter of opinion?"}
{"text":"The best breakfast in Madison. Been around forever. Order the Scrambler and you won't need lunch. Yummy"}
