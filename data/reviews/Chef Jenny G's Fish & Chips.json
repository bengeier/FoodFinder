{"text":"I had a craving for fish and chips because my brother had brought some home the night before. He opened up the box and we're pretty big eaters so any place that only gives one piece of fish we complain. So the next day I thought I'd give it a try.  I ride my bicycle over and ordered the Ackroyd. The order took a little while to prepare so if it's really busy be prepared to wait a bit. I felt bad I didn't leave a tip but it's my first time trying out the place and don't believe in tips until I've had it 2-3 times and they're consistent. I opened up the box by the beach and I already knew what to expect. I took my first bite of the fish and man was it tasty! The batter was delicious and the tartar sauce nice and light. The fish was tender, not too chewy and had a good taste. The French fries. I usually prefer my fries cut as shoestring and seeing how big these were I was a little disappointed. I popped one in my mouth and these were some darn good fries. Crispy outside and nice on the inside. Lightly salted and then I proceeded to do something stupid. I put vinegar on them and it ruined the fries crispness.  Coleslaw. Not something I look forward to but even their coleslaw was good! Just the right amount of tanginess in the dressing and the green onion complimented it nicely. I gave a 4 star because it was only my first time there. In the future given consistency in their food it could be 5. If you're a fan of fish and chips it's definitely worth a try. Even if you're not, this place has lots of potential."}

{"text":"Best Fish & Chips I ever tasted! The fish was beautifully cooked, not greasy, the batter was crisp and tasty. The fries were chunky, salted & cooked perfectly. The big surprise was the Spanish onion rings. The onions don't slip out when you take a bite! They actually almost melt in your mouth and have a sort of juicy sweetness to them that practically forces you to savour every mouthful. The price is great as well. My son gobbled up every bite and he's incredibly fussy about what he eats. I plan to make this a regular spot for us. The sign out front says Ackroyd's Fish & Chips, but this is the place. There isn't much seating and it doesn't look like a fancy place, you don't walk in expecting the best fish & chips ever, but then you just get blown away. I recommend ordering take-away and enjoying this down on the beach, which is maybe a five minute stroll down south."}
