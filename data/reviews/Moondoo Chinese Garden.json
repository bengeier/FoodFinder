{"text":"What happened to you, MoonDoo? You got to be pretty great and then you disappeared! The number listed is for Lucky Dragon who took over Moondoo's location on Weston Road.  Lucky Dragon is a solid \"meh\" at best. We miss your spicy eggplant and Almond Soo Guy, Moondoo. Please come back!"}
{"text":"Completely hidden but a good find. If you're familiar with the area, there really aren't any good restaurants in sight but you should stop in.

I've sat in and taken out, fast service and always quality food. They also deliver.

I've had several things over the years and never been disappointed. Crispy Beef...yum...my favourite, Great Tom-Yum, Can never go wrong with Shanghai noodles.

Try it!"}
{"text":"EXTREMELY disappointed after having dinner at Moon Doo.

Started off with some wonton soup - I have NO idea what was wrong with the (pork?) meat that was in this soup. It tasted AWFUL! I don't know if they don't wash their cutting boards thoroughly because the meat tasted like detergent and like stale OLD meat.

Also ordered some Shrimp Dim Sum - also tasted horrible, not fresh and too jelly, YULK!

The meat in our main dishes (Red thai curry chicken and beef flat rice noodles) didn't taste fresh and again, tasted like soap detergent. 

I will no be eating here again that is for sure!"}
{"text":"Slight above average Chinese.  5/5 would be Cynthia's in Newmarket"}
{"text":"Best gen tao in the city.The server/cashier guy hong is very friendly.Im a fan of the place!"}
{"text":"Not the worst Chinese food I've ever had, but definitely not anywhere near the best. Mushroom Fried Rice was great, veggie chow mein was super oily and unevenly cooked. Thai green curry was a joke but the veggie spring rolls were decent. Safe to say I won't be eating the leftovers."}
{"text":"Easy to miss on Weston Road (in a small semi-industrial shopping center), this place offers tasty Chinese-Canadian food.  

The decor is minimalist modern but is nicely done.  The dining room was immaculately clean too.

Everything we ordered was very tasty.  Kung Pao chicken needed more peanuts but the seasoning was excellent.  Hot and sour soup really was both hot AND sour, something that most places miss on.  An eggplant dish was very good too.

Friendly, capable service.  If you are in the High Park area and want a nearby non-authentic Chinese fix, this place should serve the purpose."}
