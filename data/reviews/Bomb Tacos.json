{"text":"Amazing quality food!  Spectacular service! The best tacos I have ever had!  A must to check out!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos, great selection too. My favorite was shrimp and fish. Chips and salsa at your table with a selection of salsas, green was my favorite. Always have to try out the beans and rice, super delicious, the beans were so creamy and the rice was so buttery and fluffy! My favorite new taco place!"}
{"text":"If you're going for bomb food in just the right size portions (for me. Female. 5'2\" 130. Light eater; I took half of it home) then this is your spot. Seriously good food."}
{"text":"SO delicious! I had the crispy potato, Baja shrimp, & fish tacos. I recommend this place and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down THE best! My wife and I just dined there with our 2 year old. I ordered the fish tacos which were better than my favorite ones in La Jolla! My wife had the pork tacos and was just as happy! Super friendly owner who was extremely sweet to our baby who loved the rice and beans and guacamole. Food is as fresh as it gets and you can taste the quality. I am so excited we found this place I cannot say enough amazing things about it. These are THE best tacos in LV and quite honesty the best fish tacos I have ever had!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING! Finally, finally, finally a restaurant in Las Vegas that makes delicious , authentic Mexican tacos. My wife (a chef) and I have been searching Vegas for this since we moved here 4 years ago. Thank you Bomb Tacos!"}
{"text":"Bomb Tacos - \"muy delicious\". It's 5 de Mayo today and I decided to have  real and authentic Mexican food. The newly opened Bomb Tacos on Durango across the park was the best choice I've could ever done. The Fish Bombas Tacos were extraordinary. I got also some guacamole,  chips and salsa. It was so good that I ordered brisket flautas to go to continue the party in style."}
{"text":"This is the third time we have been to Bomb  Tacos. My husband and I so enjoyed our dinners the first time, that we have taken friends back two more times. It won't be our last either.  EVERYTHING we have tried has been delish! The chips, salsa n guac are worth starting with-all homemade.  Try Taco Tuesday (carne asada n chicken), al pastor n fish tacos.  The owners are very friendly and do all they can to make your dining experience a good one. We have dined in and done take out.  Highly recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fish and shrimp tacos where out of this world! Also the Jamaica water was delicious! I loved all the tacos I tried!"}
{"text":"Carnitas wet burrito is the bomb!  Great friendly and quick service in a comfortable and homey setting.  Bomb Tacos can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Great tacos. Carne asada curly fries were delicious. Good new addition to the Southwest for Mexican fare!"}
{"text":"Had the Carne Asada Burrito and A+++. Chips and Guac were on point too."}
{"text":"I drove across town to give this place a shot, and then grab some Thrifty's next door.  I'm pretty sure it was the owner on the grill and who greeted us when we walked in. You could tell he not only cared, but was excited to show off his food. He also made it clear that if it wasn't on the menu, he could probably make it happen anyways.  My wife wanted a burrito that she could pick up and eat, since she's not a fan of the wet burrito knife and fork style. So we asked if all the normal stuff on top could just go inside, and they agreed it wouldn't be a problem. I ordered the 3 taco plate with rice and beans, the rock shrimp. I also asked if there was something spicy they could throw on there, since I like it a bit hotter than normal gringos. He said he could give me some habanero juice. Sounded good.  We sat for a few minutes as I sucked on my horchata, which tasted homemade, until the food came out. The waitress said that since everything was put inside my wife's burrito the plate looked a bit sad, so they added free chips and a small ramekin of salsa to the plate just to keep the burrito company. That's a small thing, but still costs them, so that's pretty cool.   My tacos were overloaded with all sorts of goodies, fresh guacamole, pico, and tons of cabbage. The beans were white, and the rice was fluffy. I started the rice and beans and they were crazy good. I'm not even normally a fan, a few scoops of some refried with the Mexican rice and I'm usually done, but these beans and rice were freaking awesome. He must have a secret recipe, like MSG, nicotine and cocaine, because just talking about them makes me want to go back for more.  After wolfing down my rice and beans, I could only get about 2 tacos down, and the wife ate half her burrito, so we boxed it up and took it home. The food was just as good a few hours later when we could both handle more.  Verdict is - while not close to home, when I'm in the area I will definitely be going back for more. This place puts real quality into the food, and the guy on the grill knows his stuff. I can't wait to try different stuff on the menu and see if it's as good as what we've had so far."}
{"text":"My wife dragged me to this little restaurant but I have to say this is the best little taco place in town. The shrimp and fish tacos are just awesome. I am definitely coming back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was great. We will be back...often. Seriously, you haven't lived until you try their Al pastor tacos. We all know of some restaurants that have a problem getting the sweet and savory of Al pastor right, well Bomb tacos does not have this problem. The word I would use to describe Bomb's Al pastor is perfection."}
{"text":"I just went on a taco testing spree, and these were easily the best of them all. The favorites of our family were carne asada tacos for the adults & shrimp tacos for the kid. They have an amazing chicken quesadilla too, but in the future I'd skip the crispy tacos altogether. I'll definitely be back here often.  Edit: I just read the negative reviews, and they mostly mention the crispy tacos. Like I said: skip them."}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco place in the area, hands down the best taco place. Staff is extremely friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"This place was overpriced. Del Taco has better food. So disappointed. I eat Mexican food all the time and this was terrible. Ordered taco de asada and one al pastor. The asada had too much fat and the al pastor wasn't edible. This place is not bomb. They do not know how to make al pastor. Eeeekkkk."}
{"text":"Went to this place because of the reviews, customer service was good. I ordered the carne asada curly fries, meat was over cooked and fries were super salty"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's like a familiar place and the owners  Roberto and Mailin worked so hard to open their new place and I like the other one at Durango with the manager Kevis he's really nice guy and he send me to this one...!"}
{"text":"Asada tacos are amazing! Anytime I'm in this area this is where I'll be having lunch. Super friendly service as well"}
{"text":"Carnitas streets Tacos were so crunchy and perfect! I ordered the homemade chips with salsa and guacamole . They have veggie options as well that looked amazing Loved the decor and service from Marco and Alex were very kind and polite . The decor is very reminiscent of a cool place you'd find in downtown Los Angeles. Everything was excellent and I'm glad I stopped in"}
{"text":"Super fresh and yummy .. we had fish tacos.. sooo good.. always happy to see small new business that's trying hard to do well"}
{"text":"Got it right on the name. Ate tacos chips/salsa/guacamole.   Yum E. Will head Back soon"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in this place as a whole. I came for the nachos but they didn't have guacamole. As a Mexican food place, you can't not have guacamole. After all it's on the majority of everything on the menu. Which I figured out they were out of due to the sign after I paid for the nachos.  So I changed my order to the fish tacos. Which for 3 fish tacos I paid $11. The fish tacos were disappointing as well. Very small, slightly over battered, & soggy. The batter wasn't to bad, however there wasway more batter than fish (fish wasn't fried long enough to have that nice slight crunch)."}
{"text":"There tacos at soo good I loved the carne asada and the melon drink. And the service is excellent thank you:)"}
{"text":"One of, if not THE best, fusion taco place I've had the pleasure of finding. Thank goodness there are two locations in Vegas, one on the west side Durango and one downtown near Fremont. Their carne asada taco is to die for, perfectly grilled with a nice sweet subtle flavor. Not too spicy. I also had a fish taco that was extremely delicious. My sister and her friend ordered cauliflower tacos which I did not have the chance to try during this trip. But they both raves about how delicious it was, I'm gonna have to make another visit to try them. Perfect that they have vegetarian options here to accommodate! There are a few other unique items on their menu, such as a crispy taco selection which I didn't get to try this time. BOMB TACOS will keep me even more excited for taco Tuesday's to come. A must visit in Las Vegas! The only reason I post 4 instead of 5 stars is due to their being out of sangria... on a Friday night! How could they  still love this place regardless."}
{"text":"Had the carne asada street tacos. Good not bomb...i did not like their \"special\" salsa and there was very little meat. Tacos are palm size, filled with guac and salsa.  I want to try the carne asada fries but they have to put more meat in the tacos."}
{"text":"The name says it all. Hands down, best tacos I have eaten in Vegas. Midget man took very good care of us up front, Vatican doll and Chuy were cheffin it up in back. (Had to ask their name). Would give my highest recommendation."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and we're not disappointed.  Tried the carnitas tacos and loved them. Rice and beans were good too. Service was friendly and quick.  Big plus you can have desert at Thrifty ice cream parlor in same center."}
{"text":"Staffs are friendly and place is cool. Food is thumbs up. Will come back for more crispy quesadilla."}
{"text":"So I live in the neighborhood and I always drive by this place and always am up for something new. I went on Friday night about 6:45 the place was empty really don't know why because the tacos were delicious.  I ordered their tacos tacos plate three  carne asada tacos with veggie rice and something I never heard of charred beans everything was delicious, and it was only ten bucks. While I was there I met the owner Robert he was very friendly and outgoing and he offered me his special habanero sauce it's behind the counter so if you like hot ass salsa make sure you ask for it, it's not in his salsa bar. They don't have beer or wine yet but they plan on getting it soon along with some sangria. I definitely we'll go back the food is very reasonable and it tastes delicious."}
{"text":"They definitely live up to their name here, these tacos are BOMB! I got vegetarian tacos & they were forsure some of the best I've ever had. My boyfriend ordered the wet steak burrito which was also so yummy. We will be returning here (:"}
{"text":"went here to enjoy some good mexican food unfortunately they didn't have tortillas to the burritos they had advertised on their menu . So i left with the same craving i came in with , even worse went to pinches afterward actually placed a order for steak fries and never even received them."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch as it was nearby and convenient. First heard about this place from a friend looking for some good tacos in town to hopefully match the ones we ate in Austin, TX. Located on the NW corner of Twain and Durango across from Desert Breeze Park, next to Dirty Fork, it was a surprisingly hidden place i never knew about, despite going to another restaurant in the same complex regularly (Zaytoon's).   I've been hoping for a place to open up near by that served street tacos so i didn't have to travel to at least the Strip for Tacos el Gordo or only have access to Taco Y Taco if i get off work, when i work at a nearby location.  This is a small little restaurant with a few tables and seats, painted super colorful that serves a surprisingly small menu. All tacos are corn tortillas unless otherwise specified. Since my friend absolute hates corn tortillas, i had asked if they had the option for flour. They said yes, and its an additional $0.50 PER taco because flour tortillas are bigger.   - CARNE ASADA w/ Onions, Cilantro, Guajillo Sauce, Guacamole - $2.25  - GRILLED CHICKEN w/ Onions, Cilantro, Guajillo Sauce, Guacamole - $2.25 - CARNITAS w/ Onions, Cilantro, Guajillo Sauce, Guacamole - $2.75 - AL PASTORE w/ Onions, Cilantro, Pineapple, Guajillo Sauce, Guacamole - $2.75 - CHORIZO w/ Onions, Cilantro, Guajillo Sauce, Guacamole - $2.50 - CRISPY BEEF BRISKET w/ Lettuce, Pico de Gallo, Sour Cream, - Guacamole, Guajillo Sauce, Cojita Cheese - $3.00 - CRISPY CHICKEN w/ Lettuce, Pico de Gallo, Sour Cream, Guacamole, Guajillo Sauce, Cojita Cheese $3.00 - GUEROS w/ Flour Tortilla, Carne Asada, Pico de Gallo, Cheese, Cabbage - $3.25 - GRINGO w/ Grilled Chicken or Steak, Lettuce, Pico de Gallo, Sour Cream, Guajillo Sauce, Cheese - $3.25 - SHRIMP w/ Creamy Cilantro Al Chile Sauce, Cabbage, Pico, Cheese - $3.25 - FISH w/ Creamy Cilantro Al Chile Sauce, Cabbage, Pico, Cheese - $3.25 - SHRIMP DIABLO w/ Cabbage, Pico de Gallo, Sour Cream, and Habanero - $5.00 - BISTRO TACO w/ Onions, CIlantro, Guajillo Sauce, Guacamole, Fried Egg - $5.00  - 3 Tacos (Carne Asada or Grilled Chicken - $10.00), (Carnitas or Al Pastor - $12.00), or (Fish or Shrimp - $12.00) w/ rice and beans  - 3 Crunchy Rolled Tacos w/ Pulled Chicken or Brisket w/ Guacamole, Sour Cream, Pico de Gallo, and Cojita Cheese - $8.00 - 2 Crispy Shell Tacos w/ Pulled Chicken or Brisket, Rice, and Beans - $10.00 - Bomb Nachos w/ 3 Quesos, Green Tomatillo, Beans, Pico de Gallo, and Guacamole - $10.00 - Asada Curly Fries w/ Tomatillo, 3 Quesos, Pico de Gallo, Sour Cream, and Guacamole - $10.00 - Wet Burritos w/ Rice, Beans, 3 Quesos, Tomatillo, Pico de Gallo, Sour Cream, and Guacamole $12.00  There are also VEGGIE options including CRISPY POTATO, FRIED CAULIFLOWER, and MUSHROOM  -----------------------------------  I had ordered 2 carne asada, 1 carnitas, and 1 al pastore. I had picked up small cups of the red and green sauce, as well as their pickled carrots and jalapenos.   When i had arrived home, I, honestly couldn't tell which meat was which. Supposedly the Al Pastore has pineapple, but it fell over and covered two different tacos.   The tacos were indeed small. Definitely 2-biters. Meats were all grilled. I cant tell if it was the Al Pastore or the Carnitas that had some grispy bits to it. Carnitas wasn't the usual \"pulled pork looking shredded pork, but also was chopped to pieces like the other meats. I'm assuming the Al Pastore was the 3rd taco that had its meat in slices, but in comparison to all the other al pastores i've had in other places, this was different as well.  The tacos overall were OK at best. Not particularly flavorful nor tender. Their red or green sauces weren't spicy nor was the pickled jalapenos. If anything, the pickled carrots had a bit more spice to it. LOL?  Price was good at least. Wonder how their shrimp/fish tacos are like? Hopefully not chopped up or sliced with crispy bits..."}
{"text":"I like the vibrant decor. It's pretty small, only about 6 tables, so don't come with a big group... the tacos are really good. The meats grilled and juicy. Guacamole is nice and fresh. Good prices. Nice variety of meats. Service is good. I look forward to going back"}
{"text":"Let's start off with the pickled carrots... I could stop here... these are phenomenal.   Shrimp taco- crisp, lightly fried shrimp...just the right amount of cabbage, cilantro and lime to keep the shrimp front and center... light, bright and wonderful.   Al pastor- meaty mouthful... plenty of pineapple to balance the salty smoke and light heat from the pork... delicious.   Crispy beef- tender shredded beef in a crispy fried shell... hearty, tasty and good.   The space is small with simple bench seating and an order counter... real casual and comfy.  The service was warm, friendly and quick.  This place is Bomb.  I'm coming back tomorrow and trying more stuff..."}
{"text":"Coming from Texas, I like more of the tex-mex flavors and spices. This place is amazing. The owner is a great guy, he will come out and talk to you making sure everything is perfect. We had a vegetarian friend along and he whipped her up some off the menu tacos. Great food, amazing flavors, outstanding customer service, and good prices to boot. Also make sure to try both the Tomatillo salsa and his off the menu hot sauces. Check tacos off my things to find in Vegas list, this is the spot."}
{"text":"The name says it all. BOMB TACOS . Not the usual tacos. Very different and unique. My lady is hispanic and isn't amused by them. On the other hand I loveeee Bomb Tacos ! Try it yourself! You might love it...you might not ? You'll never know till you try :)"}
{"text":"Soooo idk where to even start. Being from Cali it is ridiculously HARD to find good TRUE \"street tacos\" in Vegas. I went here craving tacos and I won't go anywhere else now in Vegas. The owners are extremely nice and even hooked me up with two extra tacos because he wanted me to try the different flavors. Prices are GREAT, they aren't selfish at all with the meat, all around a great place, plus I get to support small business WIN WIN. And to be in an actual building and only be what $0.25 more then the taco trucks in LA I recommend Bomb Tacos to any and everyone."}
{"text":"This is now our favorite place for tacos, the guero taco is delicious (I highly recommend).  My husband tries something different each time and hasn't been disappointed. The green salsa that comes with the chips & guac is so flavorful,  guacamole is fresh and yummy. 5 stars for great food and service!"}
{"text":"Just stopped for the first time. Chicken taco was amazing, carna asada was good and the fish taco was nasty. The first two were so good though. I'm coming back soon to try some more."}
{"text":"Tacos and nachos were really tasty. Meats tasted freshly made. I had asada, chicken, and al pastor. I ordered taco plate, wasn't a fan of the rice and beans. So next time I'd only order the tacos because those were good. Salsa selection was good too. Service was A+ was attended to quickly and food was delivered without delay. So definitely would be back when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ok third time I've tried them gosh they are so friendly but damnit not the best quality meat very tough and grisly! So today I tried the wet  asada burrito the rice and beans ate so good but they burnt that meat to a crisp I could not even eat it had I not took it to go I would have definitely returned it ! I'm done"}
{"text":"These are legit bomb af tacos. Served fresh, served hot.   The taco shells are aromatic and not overpowering. Battle won.  The Al Pastor Taco is sweet with a little intended char on it to add texture and a smokey flavor. Will be getting this again.  The grilled chicken has the char and smokey flavor too. It has a sweet-sour taste. Good contrast from the sweet beef.  The shrimp taco is loaded with red cabbage which makes it good. It is a little too crispy though. I would like a more juicy shrimp taco please.  Oh and they also serve Mexican soda. That means real cane sugar and well placed guilt.  Hipstery vibe on the place. Very pleasant lady cashier. Decent enough price. And I overheard they have vegan options. 5 star for being a legit tacos el gourdo competitor."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the 1st time today for lunch and I have to say the food was outstanding...I got the Mushroom/Cumin Street Tacos with rice and beans and this meal was full of flavor!!...I absolutely love the vegetarian option in a taco!!!...Can't wait to get back here on future trips...Great job"}
{"text":"Have eaten here 2 times now...will absolutely be returning! Shrimp tacos are amazing and filled with great stuff. Shrimp in every bite. Thought it was very good value. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"These are the best tacos in Las Vegas! The ingredients are fresh and the meat is well seasoned. They have a variety to choose from and even have vegan options."}
{"text":"Very friendly owners/operators need to try the rest of the menu next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"WOW.... I'm genuinely surprised, I was born and raised in Cali so I'm picky about my street tacos however this place is the real deal. The tacos are authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"So glad yelp notified me this place opened up near me. I couldn't get over how good the food was. The word BOMB was thrown around a ridiculous amount of times. Was already craving it the next day. Fantastic flavor. Very friendly staff . Amazing food over all for a price that feels fitting"}
{"text":"OMG!  Delicious!  I love Roberto's, but this place is waaaayyyy better!  You can tell that the ingredients are fresh and that everything was just prepared in house.  Don't go anywhere else.   (I won't even mention the asada curly fries )"}
{"text":"Tried the tacos for the first time. The customer service is exceptional and even though its a small location its very welcoming. I tried al pastor, they were good but not like an authentic al pastor taco. The other taco I tried was the shrimo one. It was okay for my taste. I couldnt figure out what was sweet in them. To my liking it would be better without the sweetness. Definately will be returning. Its a very convenient location for downtown offices"}
{"text":"Nice little hidden taco place that you just have to try! Best al pastor I've had and the owner is awesome. Everything we've tried there has been good. My boyfriend loves the light habanero sauce with his grilled chicken tacos. The al pastor and grilled chicken are my go to. If you love tacos, you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Service was pretty nice. Nothing special. The food was just ok. The carne Asada curly fries turned out to be waffle fries, which was ok. The asada was burnt leftovers with some seasoning."}
{"text":"I really liked the décor but not as much as I liked the food. The guacamole is crazy good and the chips made fresh, makes for a great opener. Had the quesadillas and carne asada tacos which were both packed full of flavor. Would really recommend this place"}
{"text":"Not bad.. not great.. average priced Mexican joint.   Restaurant was clean with bright seating and decor. I went with coworkers during lunch and they weren't that busy so we had our choice of seating.   I ordered 3 tacos - carne asada (meat was average), crispy beef brisket (the only thing crispy about it was the taco shell), and shrimp taco (shrimp was deep fried and it had more coating than meat). I appreciated the toppings on the taco more than the actual meat itself. Tacos were about $3.00 each so it didn't break the bank.. but food itself was not that memorable.   Still debating whether I'll be back or not."}
{"text":"It was very good i had the steak,fish and shrimp taco and the service was excellent. Try the ghost pepper salsa .the only thing they need is the the bags for the carrots and jalapeño when you get it to go.whenever i come to vegas i will visit this place and try the other restaurants that the chef owns"}
{"text":"Awesome Taco/Burrito joint away from the bustle of downtown. Got quite busy at lunch so a little slow but the food was super fresh and very tasty!  Recommend for anyone wanting cheap and good food!"}
{"text":"Bomb tacos is right!!!!! Everything is fire there and has amazing flavor.  Carne asada is bomb from there tacos to there curly fries asada plate. The chorizo tacos are dank! Shrimp a la Diabla tacos are bomb.com!   You will not be disappointed here.  I will be returning soon. There service is amazing , everybody is awesome from the cooks to the server to the owner."}
{"text":"They may have just opened, but they're already living up to the name. Mix and match the fish and shrimp, they're both pretty good. I preferred the shrimp, as the fish had a slight sweetness I didn't care for. The street-sized tortillas were packed with protein and piled high with guac and other toppings, every bite was bomb. I'm excited to see they also offer enchiladas.  This super-colorful location was previously another Mexican restaurant known for their vegan options, but Bomb Tacos has already made effort to retain those customers with their own vegan options. Props for that, will be trying that or a chile relleno next time. Hopefully as they settle in, they expand their menu and adjust prices. I would love to see breakfast items, and feel $8 for chips and guac/salsa is a bit too steep for this area."}
{"text":"The tacos were indeed BOMB! For sure coming back.   Tacos we ate: * Al pastor* * Fish * Carnitas  * Crispy Beef Brisket * Bistro* * Crispy shell tacos*  *Our favorites"}
{"text":"Food is excellent, just wish the price was reasonable compared to the portion size. Otherwise with the $12 per person!"}
{"text":"Saw this new place while running an errand during lunch. I tried the carne asada, grilled chicken and crispy beef brisket tacos. They were all Bomb! The service and food was great. Tastes so fresh. I will definitely  come back!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Chips and salsa is amazing. Both salsas and guac were great."}
{"text":"This place lives up to their name! If you like tacos, definitely try this place out! Carne Asada tacos are a great go to but if everything on the menu is great. I normally pick up a couple of carne asada and one or two different tacos to change it up. The chrispy tacos are fried and gooey with cheese."}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos were great. The ends of the meat are very crispy  which may not be a great fit for everyone but I liked it, gave a lot of flavor to the meat. Tacos had the right amount of meat and toppings. The decor of the restaurant is cool as well."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for my first time and loved it. The food was authentic and delicious. The service was amazing. The guy served us outside and continued to check on us and bring us water and drinks. I will definitely be back for the nachos again. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"BOMB food & friendly staff! This isn't like any other taco shop. Definitely upscale and lives up to the name. Everything is unique and tasty!!!"}
{"text":"You must come and try  The shrimp taco Was fantastic The people were friendly  Place was very clean"}
{"text":"Seriously by far the best carne asada tacos in las Vegas!!! Coming from Southern CA and tried almost every well known Mexican restaurants, this place is definitely bomb!!  I could tell they use fresh meat where it's juicy and tender and corn tortilla was perfectly soft. I will be coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"The name reflects the food! We came in on a Tuesday and ordered about fifteen tacos to go for my family. We got in and out in about 20 minutes and the staff was so friendly! I recommend the vegan potato tacos as well as the carne asada tacos! My dad loves the brisket tacos with rice and beans! I can't wait until I'm back in town so I can come back."}
{"text":"I ordered carne asada and chicken street tacos. I did not care for the carne asada tacos, some of the meat was inedible. The chicken and pickled carrots were good"}
{"text":"Love this find! Great food. Love the options and all were delicious. We tried several things and enjoyed them all. Staff was super nice. We got there a bit before it opened and they let us and our kids sit inside so we didn't have to wait in the car. Big fan. Will be back."}
{"text":"This place definitely has not only bomb tacos but bomb food altogether! The ingredients are fresh and the dishes tasty. The salsa has just enough spice. And, the guacamole .... the guacamole... yum!!! As soon as you walk in you are warmly welcomed by the staff. I'm definitely spreading the word of this wonderful place!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing tacos I was very satisfied with my food and service but Total would  come back again"}
{"text":"Bomb tacos are the bomb!  .  The guy at the counter (could have been the owner/chef) was happy to accommodate a vegetarian diet and recommended subbing a potato/herb mixture instead of meat... he also had a pototo/vege chorizo mixture.  The tacos he recommended were perfect with crispy fried shells, made in house and topped with tomatoes, lettuce, onions, queso fresco and a sour cream sauce.  The guy at the counter brought out two habanero salsas to try (one fresh habanero and one roasted) which were amazing.   We also had the rice and beans. The rice was really good but different than any Mexican rice I've had. It was made with white rice and was cooked with celery.  We really enjoyed it.  My husband had the Carne Asada, Grilled Chicken, and Crispy Chicken tacos and loved all of them but liked the Carne Asada so much he went back and ordered 2 more.   The guy at the counter had a true passion for his food and said he's experimenting with making and casing his own chorizo in house to improve the flavor and consistency of it.   This place lives up to it's name. We will be returning very soon and often!  Try it out!"}
{"text":"The name is spot on: the tacos here are bomb! I'm a fan of the original location on Durango, particularly of their grilled octopus tacos that are an occasional daily special (peep the insta to know when), but even without specials, the standard street tacos are anything but, particularly their vegan varieties.   Despite the name, they offer more than tacos, including burritos and asada fries, but I stick to the handheld version. The array of protein options will make your decision making difficult, but the rock shrimp, crispy potato, fried cauliflower, asada, and mushroom are all pretty good. They also have a crispy brisket version I haven't yet managed to try.   TIP: Prices are high and my appetite for tacos is large so, I go on Tuesdays when they have specials- 5/$15, from a limited selection."}
{"text":"Ok ill keep this review simple. Carne asada fries BOMB, carne asada tacos BOMB, churros with ice cream BOMB, brisket tacos meh... it's a counter service restaurant with cute decor, minimal seating and a decent menu. Tacos are about $2-4 each with optional beans and rice addition. They have horchata, lemonada, pina fresca, and a few Mexican sodas as well as soft drinks but they didn't have any alcohol advertised like I've seen on their Instagram so I'm not sure if that's only at their downtown location. It's not on my side of town so my frequency most likely won't be often but I'll definitely give the recommendation out!"}
{"text":"This is the best taco shop hands down. The proprietor brought his flavorful and colourful spin on what other taco shops were trying to achieve and rasied the bar to a standard that will be hard to follow. BOMB Tacos has a  unique marinade it uses that enhances and elevates the flavor of their menu items. Fresh and vibrant is the look, taste and feel of his food that invites all your senses to take part in the pride and love of what he's created."}
{"text":"Ok so if you've read my reviews of taco restaurants then you know I've been searching for the best one since I've moved to Las Vegas.   I've found it. The bold name matches its tacos! I had the Carne Asada and the Al Pastor and my gosh. The meat on both were seasoned just right , almost a sweet and spicy flavor and were not dry (a problem many places have), the onions nice fresh crunch, cilantro fresh, the pineapple on the Al Pastor was juicy and sweet making the flavors just kick, and even though the young lady at the register (turns out was the owner) warns you they are the small Tacos the portions are great! Her husband stopped and said hello on his way out to make sure I had everything I needed. On top of it all they gave the credit to the cook in the back. You pay like $.25 more or even $.50 per taco compared to other places but who cares! Worth it! I'm a fan and I hate the fact that I work only 2 blocks away...I'll be back! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Bomb tacos is the 1st place in Vegas that rivals California or Mexico. It's so crazy how Nevada's Mexican lags so far behind based on similar Hispanic culture. Love this place"}
{"text":"Love love love this place.. had the brisket, carnitas , and potato and cauliflower tacos... I can't pick a favorite.. and it won't break the bank eating here.. service is awesome .. love this place will be eating here often.."}
{"text":"I think it is a little pricey but it was a good size burrito with really good flavor. Small shop that seats 20. Bottle cokes, they need to add tea. The counter person came out to the tables often to make sure everything was ok. That was nice of her to do so."}
{"text":"Been open 18 months. Finally made it in here. They just open second location downtown. This place didn't disappoint.  My son is really picky with his quesadilla but he love the carne Asad's quesadilla. The servers are very helpful.  We tried the carnitas- love the taste and crunch. The shrimp taco was great as well. Will definitely come back a try the fish tacos and other stuff. Only thing is they didn't have Mexican corn."}
{"text":"I want to give 3.5 but not an option.  Wait was very long maybe 25 minutes for fish tacos but they are prepping for an event. Fish tacos good but fried and something was too sweet. Beans was perfect. Rice a little bland. Not much heat/spice on anything. Brisket taco tasted like boiled pot roast in sauce. That's not brisket.   Menu is super confusing and the crooked TV on the wall gave me anxiety.  Despite that still a nice menu not like every other taco shop."}
{"text":"I was very impressed...tacos were delicious.....even my kids asked for more..A++++++ the taste is very different but delicious. I had the carne asada tacos and they were bomb!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great overall experience! Food is seasoned very well, may be a little pricey but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"A true downtown gem! You can't go wrong with any of the tacos on the menu, and they have great vegetarian options. Marco, the owner, is very kind and the environment is warm and friendly. I'd highly recommend it to anyone in the Fremont area."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I avoided this place at first because of the name.. (Bomb tacos) ?  I have also  become accustomed to just making my own Mexican food at home and believed that if you want the traditional taste,you have to make it yourself. That being said with the 4 1/2 rating and the fact that it's close and convenient,I decided to give it a try. The woman in the counter was very friendly and offered to help if I had  any questions on the menu.  I have my mindset on what I wanted. I ordered the Brisket Taquitos and Chicken quesadilla. Don't expect really fast service like a  traditional taco shop. They take time to make the prepare their food and it shows.The owners obviously have a lot of pride in their restaurant.   Now for the food.  The brisket taquitos were the most flavorful, delicious  I've ever had in my life.  Juicy,crispy,flavorful not greasy..  Really nice sides too.  Quesadilla as well was really good and tasty..  I'm looking forward to going back and trying a few more things. But if you want to try something different,try this place, I highly  doubt you'll be disappointed. Not the Cheapest place in town. But you are paying for quality that's for sure. An easy 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and the service is amazingly fast! Have loved the carne asada tacos, bomb nachos, and fish tacos and have loved it all! Definitely a new favorite for my work week!"}
{"text":"Bomb Tacos lives up to its name. Seriously, some of the best tacos I have ever had. The service was top notch as well. The Crispy Brisket Taco was the favorite and the Chorizo did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I had such a terrible experience here.  My friend and I came in on a Friday evening to order food for take out. After placing our order, we sat at the table closest to the register and waited. We were soo excited to try out these bomb tacos, especially since the reviews got high ratings.   There were only 2 other tables occupied in the restaurant (4 people total) waiting for their food for dine in.  Tell me why we waited ALMOST AN HOUR before leaving with our to-go food. Two parties that came in after us even got their food before my friend and I. The wait was reaching 40 mins so I decided to check up on my order. It turns out that my order had been ready, just sitting there. Ridiculous! The servers had walked by us sooo many times and they didn't notice that we were WAITING for our food?!? We didnt even leave the restaurant for them to forget us.   I asked where my friend's order was......they stated that it was almost ready. After another 15 minutes, they had admit that her ticket got lost and just made her order also giving her an extra taco.   This HOUR wait should have never happened, they were not even busy! We were sitting there the whole time and no one even bothered to wonder why.   By the time we got home, my order was cold and soggy that I didnt even enjoy it. They could have been bomb tacos but with that wait....they didnt taste bomb to me.   They gave a voucher to my friend to come back in for free lunch. I didnt get any kind of acknowledgement or apology. No thanks, I wont be back."}
{"text":"My taste in Mexican food must be different from the other reviewers (place is averaging 4.5 stars at the moment).   I'm not saying I'm right or they're right but bomb tacos weren't the bomb to me.    I just got the brisket taco and the Gueros Taco.   Brisket taco was very small and came in a deep fried tortilla.   I personally found it to be bland and when I opened it up, there was very little inside.   The Gueros taco was better but nothing to write home about.  Not sure if it was meant to be but the tortilla was a little burnt and that flavor negatively masked the other flavors.   The meat inside was tender and pretty flavorful.   My tacos were $6.25 (I know not too much) but I feel like it hardly put a dent in my hunger.   I would need at least double to maybe get full.   Not saying don't try the place but my wife and I won't be trying it again.     Extremely hot insider the restaurant.   Luckily they have seating outside and it's a beautiful night.   Hot sauce a lacking flavor to me.  Casual dining....   order at the counter and they bring the food to you."}
{"text":"Good food but a bit pricey for tacos and asada fries. The al pastor and shrimp tacos were pretty good. I like a bit more boldness to my sauces and flavors. The waffle fries were fun & tasty but the asada was a bit over cooked. We liked the carrots and jalapeños. The rice & beans were pretty good as well. It's a nice little taco shop on the southwest side. It's nice to have over here. I'm afraid my heart still belongs to Tacos El Gordo."}
{"text":"I had the al pastor tacos and love that they actually put pineapples with it very delicious and different. My bf had the carne asda wet burrito and really enjoyed it, was a very nice size for a burrito smothered with the green sauce. I also love how he came to the table to check on us a couple of times(I wished I knew his name) and asked to refill our drinks instead of us going up to get it. Customer service was on point!!!   We will most def be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable! Had the fish tacos. Perfect. Wife had the rock shrimp tacos....and I had one of hers. Delicious. Rice and beans were awesome. Seriously the best beans I have ever had. Coming back next week! Awesome place."}
{"text":"Guys, you should try this place out. I like other Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas like Habaneros taco Grill and Michoacan. We went here for ladies lunch. I got the grilled chicken tacos. I went with Amy, Kim, and Karlee. Amy got the same one I got. Kim and Karlee split their's. And a bonus, we got chips and salsa and guacamole. Everybody here in this town. Try this place."}
{"text":"Excellent steak nachos and yummy tacos . I think my husband got a fish taco instead of the shrimp taco he ordered but other than that everything was great ."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best taco places in the valley! And we are a taco eating family!! We love street tacos and their el pastor tacos are divine, the have grilled fresh pineapple on them that complements the flavors perfectly! My husband loves their carne asada tacos they were equally yummy! Seriously go check out this new place it will not disappoint your taco cravings."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm cheap but, coming from SoCal where tacos are a dime a dozen, 12 bucks for 3 tacos seems a little steep. Nothing all that special. And Maybe when it's overpriced, I feel like they should be faster but it seemed to take forever. I almost forgot what I ordered."}
{"text":"Their tacos are literally BOMB! Most of them come with Guacamole. I haven't tried one I didn't like.  My favorite is the Crispy beef Brisket but all of them are so good! All the tacos are 2.50-3 each and you can really taste the quality."}
{"text":"These are great street tacos! Since they have opened i've been back 4 times and will most likely be back within the week. I love fish tacos and i normally goto Rubio's or Wahoo's but since Bomb tacos opened, I won't be returning to those places any time soon. I really like their shrimp taco plate. The ingredients are so fresh and they are so colorful, beautiful and delicious. Yeah i do agree with other reviewers that they could give more rice and beans, but these rice and beans are so tasty. Normally i dont even eat my side dishes but i eat it all. It's a perfect portion of food.  If you like good food with fresh ingredients goto Bomb tacos; if you want a plate full of fillers goto Robertos!"}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of tacos in Las Vegas, so when this place opened up right around the corner from my house, I tried it out. Hands down, best tacos in the city. I'm serious.  Also, the service is dope. The restaurant is super cute and clean and everyone is really friendly. I'm a new regular!"}
{"text":"First time here kinda pricey $12 for 3 taco plate rice an beans but its quality  food not the street tacos on the corner was very good i had shrimp fish an chicken tacos i think chicken was my favorite most definitely will be returning to the bomb taco"}
{"text":"Delicious, fast, friendly service. Yummy guacamole on the tacos and the carne asada burritos was tender and seasoned perfectly."}
{"text":"Is this place more expensive than I had thought it was going to be? Yes. But was it worth it? Yes!   It's restaurant quality food masquerading as a strip mall taco shop. The owner greeted us right away and even told us that he knows that his prices are high, but it's because he believes in quality ingredients. Now we can debate whether or not that's a good thing, but I guess that's his vision. Also, I think the owner has changed a few things since the first reviews. (1) I didn't have a credit card fee. (2) I saw someone get a refill on their drink for free when they asked.  But on to the food....  This was some tasty stuff! I got the tacos al pastor. My boyfriend got the chicken burrito. I got the green and red salsa then asked the owner which was hotter. He told me he had a habanero one in the back if I wanted heat. I took him up on it. All three were great. As expected some paired differently with the dishes. So I suggest getting all three and picking the one you like with what you're having. The tacos were street style/small, but they were packed with flavor. That burrito was fantastic from the bite I had. I honestly was still hungry after my tacos, so I ordered the carne asada fries. They are curly fries and packed with flavor. All of the meats were moist and well seasoned.   As for miscellaneous observations: The shop itself was clean. He seemed to have a few regulars already. Also,  I watched some get an incorrect order, but they did remake it.   Overall, I loved it. If you are looking for a tasty quickly bite and you care about what you are eating, this is a great find."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Super cute set up, has a sort of beach shack vibe & the tacos are to die for! I ordered four tacos, the carne asada, el pastor, shrimp and crispy brisket. I give all of them a 10/10 except the brisket, that one didn't thrill me. They added chopped pineapple to the carne asada taco and that was a great new twist for me. Think I'll be asking them to add it to all of the tacos, especially the shrimp next time. It did seem a little pricy; two of us ate for $38 and that included 8 tacos, a chips and salsa basket & two drinks. However, it was definitely worth every penny!"}
{"text":"They advertised a Cinco de Mayo event Sat 5/5. Did a Facebook Event even. Went there after Race for a Cure, had several people going to meet there. I know $.75 a taco isn't a big deal but I hate bait and switch.  Went to Kitchen at Atomic and had a great lunch."}
{"text":"Bomb tacos are just that!!  They have the best street style tacos in Las Vegas, it brought us back to Mexico.  We had the crispy chicken, carnitas, fish and al pastor tacos...all delicious!!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  I had the Fish Taco and the Spicy Carnitas Taco a few minutes ago.  The reputation is well-earned.  Added to my list of go-to places."}
{"text":"Delicious! Ordered the carne asada nachos and the Al Pastor tacos! Amazing! Way better than Roberto's/Don Tortaco and just a little bit more in price."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend the al pastor tacos and three rolled tacos as they are amazing! The interior of the store is super cute and well done, but most importantly the owners are incredibly friendly and kind. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Legit taco shop, off strip, with some of the freshest ingredients you'll find. Chips and taco shells are fried fresh and come out piping hot.   Try the al pastor, served with a bit of pineapple and char."}
{"text":"Man was this place good!  It doesn't look like much, the chairs and tables are crammed into a little space but we had the Nachos with Grilled Chicken and 3 Grilled Chicken Tacos plate.  Excellent food!  I will return!"}
{"text":"Good tacos and very friendly. Not much seating but I did carry out. Their chips were thick and crisp."}
{"text":"I frequent Downtown more than the strip, I like how it is progressing and rather support a small business than the mega chains on the blvd. I first heard about this location via recommendation from the awesome folks at donut bar. Unfortunately I was hungry and in a big rush but the gal who took my order was very nice and made some recommendations on what to grub on. I was hungry but there was no way to prepare me for the Carne asada fries which were beastly in goodness and size. I want to come back again to sample the tacos, but first impression wise I am a fan. Taco on!"}
{"text":"Came to this place based on reviews.  Very yummy if you love tacos.  My soon to be 4 year old LOVED her rolled chicken tacos.  I had the carne asada taco and the crispy beef brisket taco.  Both were delicious and didn't disappoint.  If you are looking for not your normal tacos this is the place to try."}
{"text":"Really a 4.5 star rating but ultimately, I would definitely come back here again when I'm in the area. Came here Saturday around 11:30a for an early lunch. Customer service was good, the cashier was patient with us when we were being indecisive. There's just so many options to pick from!!!  The carne asada tacos, man.....OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!! Yum!!!! The onions & cilantro, avocado, the flavoring of the meat....it was juicy and tender...typing this is making my mouth water and suddenly craving for Bomb Tacos so bad! You can order a taco combo plate or a la carte. My carne asada tacos were around $2.50 each (?) and my boyfriend's al pastor taco was $2.75.   Next time, I would like to try their shrimp taco and their al pastor taco. Oh and their carne asada curly fries looks mighty tempting also!"}
{"text":"Sooo good!!! They were already sold out of the beef brisket taco so get there early for that! I got the crispy shell taco and it was amazing! I've had tacos all over the world and this ranks in the top 3 best tacos ever!! The prices are amazing too. $2.75-$5 depending on which one. The decor is super cute too, very modern/chic Mexico style. Come here!"}
{"text":"Delicious taco place !! Definitely will be going back to bomb tacos . The staff was friendly and the food was amazing . Everything tasted fresh and you really are getting that spicy Latin flavor ! YUM ! Can't wait to go back and try more on their menu ."}
{"text":"Today was my first time coming to this place and I am so glad that I found this place. Hands down, the absolute best tacos I have ever had in my life. And trust me I've had my fair share of tacos from all over. Everything about this place is perfect.  The place is super cute, colorful, and kind of rustic at the same time. The staff was super awesome, warm, friendly and all smiles.  I came in just to order take out for my husband, but ended up trying them out while I waited for my take out order. I ordered grilled chicken tacos for the kids and ordered myself a vegetarian shiitake mushroom street taco. When I bit I to that vegetarian taco, it was an immense burst of flavor. I have never been to a place where they can make veggies taste that good. My kids loved the chicken tacos, and their lemonade. My kids are really picky eaters, so when they ate their food in less than 2 mins, then that means the food was great.  For my take out, I ordered fish tacos, al pastor and carnitas tacos. My husband and his co workers  loved it so much, that they sent me back to the restaurant for round 2.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that's looking for seriously great flavorful tacos or just food in general. This place is really really good. The chose the perfect name for their business. I will be back-soon!"}
{"text":"These tacos live up to their name.  They are so good we went back twice in one day.  Al pastor and fish were my faves but everything we tried left us wanting more.  I wish they had margaritas but made due with some delicious sangria.  Prices are a little high.  My main gripe is that they advertise specials on social media and don't honor them.  Not sure if it was a miscommunication or what.  Other then that service and food was outstanding."}
{"text":"Stumble along this taco place Friday night. Don't let it fool you, this is no Roberto's Taco Shop. These are truly Gourmet ingredients put together and assemble to make gourmet tacos. These are without a doubt the best tacos in Las Vegas I have been everywhere in the city and I can unequivocally say this."}
{"text":"Sooo good and the vegan options are even amazing!!! Very nice staff as well. They have an amazing variety on there menu. If you like really spicy things ask to try the habanero salsa!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. I got the fish tacos ($12) both times and it's been excellent. This place is a little on the high side for a hole in the wall Mexican restaurant but it is really worth every penny. Everything has great flavor, including the rice and beans. The owner suggested I try the habanero sauce on my tacos and it did not disappoint! He keeps it behind the counter and it comes with a warning so you need to ask for it   I want to go back and try something else but honestly the fish tacos are so good I'm afraid to try anything else. There's probably a hundred Mexican restaurants between my house and here but it does stand alone from Roberto's, Habanero's or any of the counter-ordered Mexican joints."}
{"text":"Even though Bomb Tacos is no where near where I live on my typical driving route, I found a way to make this part of my return route home and created a \"long-cut\" - something I seem to be doing more of lately, lol! Not very efficient but it works. :)  I got there right after the opening hours and ordered 4 tacos: carne asada, al pastor, carnitas, and crunchy beef brisket. It took a bit longer than I expected for the order to come out, but not too long. Pricing is reasonable as well.  But was it worth it? Absolutely. All the tacos were really good. I think my favorite was the carnitas. They were all simply dressed with onions, cilantro, and guacamole (except the crunchy brisket, which had lettuce, tomato, and cotija), the flavors were on point.   It has been awhile since I have had Cali-Mex, so it is harder for me to compare to that standard. But I have to say this comes close, and will become my go-to taco place in Vegas."}
{"text":"Finally made it here, tacos everything i hoped for.   The Beef brisket hard tacos were fried perfectly and the brisket was super tender.   The cauliflower taco and the mushroom tacos were also stuffed as full as they could be with the cauliflower winning the vegetable taco taste test in my book.   Service was great, venue was clean and the prices were on point and prices right. 5 stars for being exactly what they advertise.   Photos to be added later."}
{"text":"Bomb Tacos is a pretty bold statement, and boy, do they live up to the name!!! I will add pictures next time we go, but for now, let's start from the beginning.   We walked in to a quaint little spot with bright hand-written menus posted around the counter and colorful, vibrant decor adorning the walls. We were instantly greeted by a friendly face behind the counter. She was more than happy to help explain the menu for us first-time visitors. She took great care of us!   We decided, so that my husband and I could try a couple different things, to order a shrimp taco plate and a chicken and asada taco plate. Each plate come with 3 gourmet tacos and rice and beans.   As soon as they brought our plates, you could see right away just how fresh all the ingredients were. All the colors of the veggies and meats on the plate popped and complimented each other beautifully. *Each taco comes with a dollop of guacamole on top, too.* The presentation was spot on!   We swapped a taco from each plate, added just a little of the delicious salsas they have, and jumped in! Every single bite was bursting with flavor! The shrimp were cooked perfectly, with just little bit of a crunch from a light coating. The grilled chicken was tender and moist, with a slight smokey flavor that was amazing! The cabbage, pico de gallo and guacamole in the tacos were super fresh! And even the tortillas were really good!   Needless to say, we will most definitely be returning to this fine, family run establishment. You can tell that the owner/chef really takes pride in his art, from the freshness and quality of ingredients, to the presentation, to the customer service! Thank you! Those were some very BOMB TACOS!!!"}
{"text":"Tacos were amazing and I'm rarely impressed with the selection of Mexican food in the valley. Very authentic and the rice and beans were delicious too. You can tell they use fresh ingredients because you don't feel heavy after eating their food like you do when you eat at Mexican places that use lard.  I would love to see them add a few things to the menu such as a vegetarian/vegan taco, a taco salad of some sort and margaritas/beer.  I am looking forward to seeing this business grow."}
{"text":"Holy shit, the fish taco is crazy! I sampled several of the menu choices but the one that stands out is the fish taco, the shrimp comes in a close second with carne asada and al pastor close after that.  Milene, and The rest of the staff are super friendly and helpful.  I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"So I rarely give 5 stars on my reviews and I have to be honest and say that I've been to bomb tacos on the west side a hundred times. This location doesn't disappoint, it is a carbon copy of the west side just a little bit more hip. Chef Robert has the best period fish taco period in the city period! Every now and then I will get him to make me fajitas which aren't on the menu YET. Make sure you ask for them and you will be blown away."}
{"text":"This place is unreal. The owner is amazing, very hospitable.  BOMB TACOS, lives up to the name."}
{"text":"Not only are their tacos bomb but their chips and guac are bomb, wet burritos are bomb, everything is bomb. Other reviews complained about price but I'm a broke college student and I'm not complaining man this place is bomb as hell. It's $12 for the shrimp tacos but not only do you get tacos with a bunch of shrimp (they ain't cheap with their food here, bro. they make sure you'll enjoy it.) it comes with a side of rice and beans. The quesadilla comes with guac, pico de gallo and sour cream. The quality is A1. You're paying for the quality you don't usually get at other places and the person up from is super friendly!"}
{"text":"What can I say but the tacos here are the bomb-diggity. My homies and I rolled up 3 deep to this joint and I must say, these are some of the best tacos I've ever had. They put tacos el gordo and los tacos to shame. I had the crispy beef brisket taco, the carne asada, chorizo and fish taco and ALL of them were superb. The chips and guac were also on par and de-lish as hell. Customer service was good also. Shout out to my man, \"Midget Man\" (that's what he called himself) on taking care of us and giving us some great customer service. I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Arrive by myself at 938pm when Google and yelp both say 12am. Open sign Is on. Walk in and they say we're closed but you can order food to go. Meanwhile others are dining in dining room..  Being closed is completely different than only offering food to go so learn the difference. Clearly people are just being lazy and not willing to wipe down another table.  This isn't gueridon service nor do you need to crumb my table while I eat 3 bite tacos.. What a mammaluke running a new restaurant and turning down customers. Because I'm a loser with nothing better to do I will probably try it another time.. this visit was an epic FAIL.."}
{"text":"Ugh this place is a gem! I've never been here, we have only ever ordered from BiteSquad.  We just recently tried the curly asada fries and WOW!!! One of my favorite things from here & honestly best asada fries I've had! The curly fries are PERFECT and so much crispier and tastier than the traditional fries. The shrimp and fish tacos are our to go to tacos. Very juicy and full of flavor. The very last time we ordered a chicken quesadilla as well that hubby and I shared & it was also delicious! I usually don't like ordering from places like Uber eats cause the food is always usually cold or gross when it's to go but BOMB TACOS DOES NOT DISAPPOINT"}
{"text":"First time here and the owner / chef was very very kind and had amazing customer service! My husband got the fish tacos and I got shrimp they were both so good! Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Saw the very positive yelp reviews, and had to try for myself. Dined with my sister and her family from SanDiego, and all agreed that the drive from Vegas strip was worth it. Great street style tacos. All ingredients seemed very fresh and just in the right portions. I had the carnitas tacos (3) and would highly recommend. Small place with about a dozen tables of 4 and 2."}
{"text":"Finally!!! A proper taco shop on the west side (not named Chili Express)...by proper I mean several notches above the Faustos/robertos variety.   I have tasted almost everything and it's all good...proper tortillas, well cooked meats, fresh ingredients, strong salsas although the pickled carrots need more pickling.  Overall I am happy to eat here vs driving to Tacos El Gordo or Taco Y taco for my daily fix."}
{"text":"Probably the best tacos in town. Fresh ingredients and friends staff. We will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"Seriously this is the best taco shop ever. They truly live up to their name \"bomb tacos\" we have been here three times and every time it tastes better than I remembered. In addition to tasting good the place has great atmosphere. The staff is very friendly. The clerk already remembers us like we were long time regulars. The decor is super cute too. We highly recommend this place. It's right across the street from desert breeze park so make a family outing of it. You won't regret it :D"}
{"text":"This place is the best brisket taco the flavor of the brisket was great and also the pork and pineapple taco excellent I will go back"}
{"text":"We sampled a few different fillings: fish, shrimp, al pastor, and carnitas. These tacos are amazing!! Seriously. Amazing. We had chips and salsa, too. Everything tastes home made and flavorful."}
{"text":"This is now going to be my go-to place for tacos. I love tacos. These tacos I loved a lot. A lot!  Had 3 tacos - fish, beef brisket, and carne azada. Each one of them had a unique flavor and ingredients that complemented each wonderfully-prepared protein. The side of rice and beans were nice too! Chef brought us a couple of sauces to taste on the side - a roasted habanero sauce and a rawer habanero sauce. Both were excellent and very spicy, a little goes a long way and adds a nice kick to the dish.   Excellent hospitality and I think the chef takes pride in his creations. Chef told us that they also have vegetarian and vegan options. Excited to try more of this place."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! Everything on the menu is delicious. I especially love the crispy brisket tacos and the fish taco. The churros are a MUST. I absolutely recommend stopping by this yummy taco spot next time you're downtown"}
{"text":"Los tacos mas ricos de las vegas definitivamente, todo fresco y el servicio lo mejor recomendado cien por ciento"}
{"text":"Love their vegetarian mushroom street tacos! Such amazing flavor in the entire menu. I recommend trying the churros and ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"They sure do have some bomb tacos! This place is for meat eaters and vegetarian/vegans. I got all three of the vegan tacos, one was deep fried, one with mushrooms and the third with fried cauliflower. They were all tasty but the mushroom was my favorite, hands down! We also enjoyed their delicious chips and guacamole which comes with both red and green salsas. I love that each of the tacos were topped uniquely to make for different delicious flavor combinations.   The prices are good here as we enjoyed 4 tacos, chips, salsa, guac and two really large beers for $25. Great for late night grub if you're hanging downtown."}
{"text":"Bomb!!!!!!! This place lives up to its name! I would recommend this place ten times over! Bomb tacos is BOMB!!!!"}
{"text":"Super good street tacos. The Al Pastor was the star! Liked it better than Tacos el Gardo. Carnitas weren't our favorite. Generous size quesadillas with sour cream, guacamole, pico all for $6! My kids loved them. Salsa verde was delicious. Don't let  hole in the wall outward appearance stop you from trying these awesome tacos!"}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time. Ordered a few tacos and a wet asada burrito. Food was great, can't be more happy. Great place for not a lot of money."}
{"text":"Totally yummy and great customer service. A tiny shop, behind the Animal Hospital, with seating for about 25 people. Highly recommend Bomb Tacos! We had the carne asada and chicken tacos, and we'll come back for more."}
{"text":"New hip place.  LIKES: Customer service & Fish taco  DISLIKES: Way over priced especially when my Al Pastor meat was BURNED OR OVERCOOKED and my carne asada in the curly fries. I felt like we got the old batch of the meat."}
{"text":"Dank Deliciousness! Family owned and they take passion in their work. Shrimp Taco was Money!! Carne Asada tacos were \"Bomb\" too! When you order they will tell you what's bomb on the menu too!! Haha, good people here."}
{"text":"Tacos are by far the best tacos in all of Las Vegas . This place is super cute. Ever since I discovered this restaurant I probably have already ate it about 7 times within the week I discovered it. I have ate the fish, chicken, shrimp and vegetarian ones and they are all super delicious! There's layers to flavors you discover as you but I to it. I recommend for everyone to check them out"}
{"text":"The food is good, like solidly fresh and delicious.  However, the two times I have been by were for lunch and they are slooooow.  The first time, there were 2 people ahead of me, and it took about 20 minutes for us to get our 3 tacos (carnitas, crisp brisket and chicken) and some asada bomb nachos.  Food is good enough to forgive the wait.  Second time around, we arrived and there were again 2 people who had ordered (3 tacos each) ahead of us, and again it took at least (!) 20 minutes to get our 2 tacos (diablo shrimp and crisp brisket), asada bomb nachos and asada curly fries.    Nothing wrong with the food.  It's really good.  The diablo shrimp tacos and crispy brisket beef tacos definitely stood out.  The asada was as good as amazing home-cooked asada, but otherwise not special.    All that said, the time they spend on taking care of your order does show.  The fries were crisp and not greasy as they were properly drained from the fryer, and the nachos were warm and not just hot item to melt over a plate of chips.  Also, the carnitas was cut and each piece evenly seared crisp on both sides, etc., to name a few special details afforded when concentrating on getting out one order at a time.    The hot sauces are tasty and feel freshly made, but they do lack flavor.  I don't just mean they lack heat, which they also do, but for the bold and bright fresh look and consistency of the sauces, they just don't pop.  That is a serious bummer for tacos.    This review is only 3 because the wait on the kitchen prevents me from coming by for lunch anymore, and the food is good but just not special enough for me to make a special trip across town."}
{"text":"I made fun of this place's name when I first drove by.  I still think it's kind of dumb, but I gave it a shot anyway because the Rice Shop was closed.  It was fantastic.  All of it.  The rice and beans that come with mexican food are usually something I just pick at a little and then throw away.  Not this time.  Nothing on the plate went to waste.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I so wanted to eat here and like it! A few weeks ago, my son and I went to see Hamilton at Smith Center and were starving afterwards. Wanted tacos, so we drove to this place because Yelp said its as was open until 11pm. Got there at 10:30 and it was all locked up --  what a bummer, don't say you're open late if you're not going to do it!"}
{"text":"Great spot for some delicious Mexican food. Great service and bomb food that's legit. Highly recommend this spot if you're in the area, and midget man says \" get your booty's on down here and have some tacos\""}
{"text":"In love with new taco shop in town. The food was amazing. The tacos al pastor were really authentic and full of flavor. The owner is energetic and friendly. The decor of the shop is vibrant and chic. Great new spot worth a visit."}
{"text":"Seriously BOMB TACOS! I have been to this location a few times now(which is completely out of my way-that's how BOMB they are) and every time I've gotten a different taco, for research purposes and every taco that I have had is amazing including the vegan tacos. I recommend trying the curly asada fries. AMAZING."}
{"text":"The food might be good. Idk! It's been 40 minutes since I called and my food is not ready. I called and placed my order over the phone, yet, two customers who were ordering when I walked in the door, got their food and left. When I asked the two employees in the front counter, they just blamed each other and one started arguing with me instead of fixing the problem .. and I'm still waiting...."}
{"text":"***4.5 Stars*** Ordered: -Crispy beef brisket  -Shrimp Diablo taco -Al Pastor taco -Carne Asada taco  Crispy beef brisket taco - perfectly seasoned/super tender brisket that is contained in a crispy deep fried shell. It is topped with lettuce, pico de gallo, sour cream, guajillo sauce, and cotija. This was pretty good.   Shrimp Diablo taco - contained habanero sautéed shrimp topped with cabbage, pico de gallo, and sour cream. It had the perfect amount of spice which was balanced out with the sour cream. The shell was slightly harder than a typical street taco shell. I love spicy food so this was my favorite.   Al pastor taco - this was topped with guacamole, onions, guajillo sauce, cilantro, and pineapple. This tasted slightly different from what I'm use to.  I usually go to taco y taco or tacos el gordo for al pastor tacos so I was expecting it to taste slightly similar. The al pastor at this place had more of a smoky flavor to it and was slightly dry. Not my favorite but was still good.   Would I recommend this place? Yes. Definitely give this place a try. You can't knock a place until you've tried it. Just a heads up, the place is small so it can feel a bit congested when standing in line to order."}
{"text":"They just opened. And ive already had about 50 tacos there. It's absolutely amazing. The cashier, Marco, is amazingly nice, and greets me with a smile and a handshake whenever I come in. I highly suggest the carne asada, and al pastor. I havent had one taco that's less than amazing there, and I plan on going at least once a week. I'm a local artist and would love to help paint."}
{"text":"Lunch break downtown between hearings and checked out Bomb Tacos that just opened this week. The only bite for under $4 in this hood. The shrimp taco, sweet and crunchy, was my favorite! Great service and near the Donut Bar and Container Park so you can take a stroll around after your tacos."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here, it is definitely worth trying! It's different than any other taco shop in Vegas and each taco has a unique but delicious flare. Everything tastes very fresh. Brisket and Carne Azusa tacos are what I'd recommend! Also the service is fantastic and the owner is sweet."}
{"text":"Hey, People. I am sitting in Bomb Tacos on Carson and just Wow!! We had the shrimp, carne asada and pastor soft tacos snd the crispy beef snd crispy chorizo tacos. Pastor came with mango salsa and great seasoning. Shrimp was very nice with a bit of a zing. My tough reviewing husband jumped up with the last bite still percolating in his mouth to get \"just one more\"!! This is a great place. Tuesday night is great for local parking, too. My husband asked for the most popular taco and got the beef brisket, which is pictured. Oops- 6 tacos disappeared before I could take a shot! So, we will be here often! Fun music, great people watching, good beer, Mexican soft drinks, and wonderful food."}
{"text":"Drove by this place and after checking out the IG page I had to check it out. The food look awesome. Came here with my girlfriend, who is a vegetarian, and found some delicious options for her. The carne asada curly fries.. BOMB! Potato taco.. BOMB! Carne asada tacos.. BOMB! The cauliflower tacos.. Bomb! We met Robert who was super friendly and helped us make our selections. Will be back again.."}
{"text":"Oh man! What can I say??? Bomb tacos are really really bomb! I had the shrimp tacos and homemade horchata. The flavors are on point. The owner is such a sweet humble guy and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Went here based off the reviews and I was not impressed. I ordered A le carte Carne Asada Tacos and a Quesadilla.  The tacos were plain and nasty. The Quesadilla was falling apart and the topping did not taste good either. This was the worse Quesadilla I ever had. Maybe this was an off day but I won't be back. I got better food at a none authentic Mexican place."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great little taco place. I'm in love with taco plates and the steak quesadilla. Really great service. Fun atmosphere, lots of really cool chalk work on the walls. It's a little pricey but I believe it's worth it! Try the brisket tacos!!"}
{"text":"Food is Amazing!! The Carne Asada Curly fries are such a delicious creation and the flavors complement each other so well. The Chicken tacos are full of flavor, as well as the Al Pastor tacos. Everything was so fresh, the meat was lean, the sauces burst with flavor and you can really tell they take pride in their food. I highly recommend this place and will be a returning customer! The staff was extremely friendly and the set up of the restaurant is super cute too, bright and vibrant colors. And when you are done eating the delicious food, don't forget the churros with ice cream for dessert. DELISH!!"}
{"text":"Solid tacos, but the standout was the carne asada fries. They're curly fries, and the meat is like a cross between burnt ends and carne asada, topped with guac, sour cream, and cotija."}
{"text":"Really stoked to see a new taco restaurant pop up here in Vegas. The food was excellent especially the Carnitas, brisket, and carnet Asada"}
{"text":"Thea tacos are sexy af and also delicious. Love the vegan options!! Deep fried cauliflower taco street style mushrooms."}
{"text":"I LOVE BOMB TACOS. There is a small handful of great street taco joints in Las Vegas, and Bomb Tacos is among the best. You can order pretty much any taco off the menu and be confident that you're going to get a lot of strong, delicious flavor. The place is small and intimate, but the staff is super friendly and everyone there is happily enjoying delicious tacos. I'm super stoked they recently opened a downtown location in addition to their location on Durango."}
{"text":"This place deserves my first ever yelp review! Great mexican food and great staff! I love their Crunchy Chicken tacos! And I always order it with rice and chips on the side. The Diablo shrimp, carne asada and rock shrimp tacos are a must try too! And they also have the best Horchata that I ever had! Make sure to order it, you'll see why."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some tacos and sangria. Tacos were very flavorful and sangria was amazing as well. The decor is very colorful and fun. I would highly recommend checking out this place if you're ever in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The atmosphere was really cool they played awesome music with there great food. I ordered the asada fries which were really really good. Definitely need to ordered that. There salsa was really good lots of flavor not watery like some places. The horchata was really not over sweet or too much cinnamon. You definitely wanna check this place out"}
{"text":"Small little taco shop, but lots of food to choose from. What I ordered and enjoyed was the carne Asada curly fries. It was definitely different, but it tasted good. I would recommend sharing this with two people because it's HUGE and has a ton of food.   The only thing I wished were different was when I asked for water, I was offered bottled water. I avoid using plastic water bottles, so I pulled out a canteen and she said they only had soda and bottled water, I couldn't even get a cup of water, so I ate my food without any water.  Other than that, the food was good, but there's not a real point in me eating here if I can't drink any water."}
{"text":"The Sangria is fantastic! I'm always down to try new spots in town. I get even more excited for taco places with good veggie tacos!! I had the potato and deep fried cauliflower. I'm sure I'll be back again someone this week :)"}
{"text":"Small little taco shop in shopping center across from dessert breeze park , while the actual place is small and only seats like 15 people , the quality sure is good . I got 3 tacos , carne asada, al pastor, and shrimp. Even though there was only like 3 people ahead of me the food still took around 15 mins to get out but I think for good reason . All the meat was steaming hot as if they had just cooked each one individually before serving . Definitely fresh meat, salsa and shrimp . Extra salsa is on the side as always with taco shops but the flavors are great . Tacos are regular street taco size so 3 for me was like a good sized snack , 4 would have gotten me full I would say . The menu includes quesadillas and curly fries so definitely will be back to try more . Vegetarian options also available and willing to try at least one taco from every kind they got ! (About 6)"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. We got the chicken tacos and a carne asada burrito they were great. We will be going back again."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos south of Alaska. Staff is wonderful and the food has just the right amount of heat. The carne aside fries are awesome but so much food...bring friends"}
{"text":"Game changer, scratch that, LIFE changer. These are hands down the BEST tacos I've ever had, period, full stop!  Small little dine-in or carry out, the rice and beans taste like they're smoked in some secret something, the fish and shrimp have a slight batter, but it provides just the right taste.  I don't think I could sing enough praises about this place, you just have to try them!"}
{"text":"Looking for a quick bite and stumbled upon Bomb Tacos. What a treat ! The food came out pretty quick and wow was it delicious!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to its name! Definitely a place that i can see myself coming to weekly. You must try the taco de carnitas!"}
{"text":"Located in the same plaza as Other Mama, The Rice Shop, Zaytoon and others, Bomb Tacos took over the space formerly occupied by a couple other taco shops. But this is nothing like its predecessors. It's run by Robert Solano, formerly of Mundo, and he brings a level of sophistication to the food that other casual taco shops lacked.   I got a platter with 2 carnitas and 1 al pastor, which came with vegetable rice and beans. Both tacos were amazing. The carnitas tacos full of tender morsels of pork with crisp edges and a good bit of heat. The al pastor also brings the heat but the pineapple sitting on top tempers it, somewhat.   On another visit I tried the asada curly fries. I loved the charred edges of the asada that still managed to be tender in the center and packed some noticeable heat. The meat topped a large mound of curly fries along with tomatillo cheese sauce, guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo to create a massive serving that's large enough to share or you can just pig out yourself for the ultimate cheat day meal.  For dessert I tried the churros and ice cream. It's a large portion good enough for 2 or 3 to share with crispy, cinnamon and sugar covered churros cut into small bite size pieces along with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream. After the heat from the tacos, it was a nice way to end the meal."}
{"text":"Very friendly service from the door. Smells good tastes great. Bomb ass sauce too. Carne nachos was the business."}
{"text":"So open for a week at this location. Located Downtown Las Vegas where a much needed taco was in very much need! Place is clean and very cute with some beginnings of murals painted by Chef Robert himself. So, not only does he cook some delicious food but he brings his artistic talents to create a great atmosphere. The menu has a little bit of everything. So, I began with the basics when it comes to tacos.  Carne Asada -  Fine diced onions/ cilantro with a guajillo sauce (not spicy and very tasty), fresh guacamole and light cheese all on a small (street tacos size corn tortilla) super hot which is the way any taco should be served in order to enjoy the freshness of the guacamole and other fresh ingredients. Next I had the Carnitas - same construction as the asada except with pork carnitas.  Next had the Al Pastor which was very good. Probably not my favorite of everything I had, but definitely worth trying. Why was it not my favorite? It's more of  home made al pastor not shawarma style which in my opinion is what a true al pastor should be all the time no exceptions but none the less good flavor. I then moved on to the Braised Brisket which by far was the best of them all. Fresh Romain, guajillo, pico, a dap of sour cream, fresh guacamole and topped off with just the right amount of cotija cheese all in a crispy warm shell corn tortilla. To finish it all the rock shrimp tacos which were good. In my opinion best and must have's are:  Braised Brisket, Carne Asada and Carnitas.   They have veggie and vegan menu options (which I will try next time I stop by)   Currently they do serve beer, Mexican Coke and other Mexican drinks as well as fresh waters are coming soon.  They will also be expanding the menu to burritos and some other seafood options.   Bomb Tacos are bomb and glad to have them downtown!  Perfect place to go eat after being on Fremont Street on a late weekend. Open until 2am on weekend and midnight during the week.   Thank you Chef Robert & Team for bringing some quick, easy and enjoyable tacos to our Great Downtown Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I ordered the wet burrito with carnitas. It was HUGE and truly bomb.com. The carnitas were crispy in some parts, which I personally liked. Overall, I think this is a great addition to downtown for lunch options and I would definitely come back when I'm craving tacos.   4 stars because it took longer than you would expect for the type of food they are serving. We came around 1 pm hoping to avoid the lunch rush. It was still busy (every table was taken), so maybe that's why it took longer for the food to come out. Also the restaurant might be working out kinks in service since it's new. The staff was super friendly and attentive though!"}
{"text":"Tacos where bomb! Tried the fish, shrimp, crunchy chicken and asada. All full of flavor. Staff was very friendly, sad that they ran out of the sangria but overall very pleased. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my husband, he said we have to try this place. I got 3 tacos. 2 fish and 1 chicken and a soda. The fish tacos were very good and have a kick. The chicken taco was amazing just the right amount of everything.  I will order this again. They are Street tacos. The service is great to. It is a order and find a seat place."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised to stumble upon such a tasty place. Everything was fresh and made to order. My kids had a grilled chicken quesadilla and I had fish and shrimp tacos. Everything is grilled! The salsa tastes homemade. Decor is fun and bright with  the menu is on chalkboards. I'd recommend highly!"}
{"text":"What a cute little taco shop! I wasn't expecting it to be so colorful and ...packed for lunch! As soon as I walked in, I ran into the line of maybe 5 people. There was one person behind the counter taking orders and running food and drink (poor guy I thought.) Waiting in line gave me enough time to look at this awesome taco menu. It's written beautifully on a chalk board! They have so many options for such a tiny shop, and I wanted to try them all! I settled for a. 3 carnitas tacos plate with rice and beans and one shrimp taco (OMG THE HABANERO SAUCE IS DEADLY PLEASE ORDER IT ON THE SIDE IF YOU DONT WANT TO DIE) and a Sangria! What!? You sell alcohol too? Beers on tap? Holy Guacamole!  We took an open table and as much as I love the decor, the tables are very awkward.. This was a puzzle for me as I sat and waited..when I finally realize that these tables are works of art! They are bar stools turned tables! That's super rad. Our food and drink came out pretty quickly and overall was ok, I think I may just need to order something else but the SHRIMP TACO was BOMB, but I think the sangria was my favorite. Ha! Can't wait to bring the squad! The cashier/server, Alex, was very personable and very attentive regardless of how busy he was!"}
{"text":"This place.... this place is great! A lil pricey ($3/taco) ($10/nachos) but worth it! If you come you have to ask for the habanero sauce! Friendly staff and even asked if i had questions from the menu"}
{"text":"Dropped by this new taco joint last night after work. The news is quite obviously spreading, as within a few minutes of arrival, the place was filled with customers. Though the menu may look familiar, the quality and taste of the food is refreshingly well done. The pricing falls in-between your go-to sit down Mexican Restaurant and your regular taco joint.   Being a Las Vegas local where you have the culinary world at your fingertips, it is always great to add a new, yet familiar, option where hard work, skill, and love are the main ingredients to your meal. I will definitely stop by again soon."}
{"text":"We had lunch here on Cinco de Mayo and they were running a  $12 special for any 5 tacos which was a great way to try a variety on our first visit.  I got the following 5: Al Pastor...A-Ok Fish(sole)...pretty BOMB Carnitas...interestingly BOMB...crispy, meaty pieces as opposed to shredded pork Shrimp...FRICKIN' BOMB! Crispy Beef Brisket...FRICKIN' BOMB! I just love that each taco has it's own distinct flavor....so BOMB!  Horchata...Fresh, not powdered  Chips and Salsa ($5) made fresh, served with salsa rojo, verde, and guacamole...BOMB  Service was great and food was tasty overall. One of my favorite brick and mortar taco spots along with Los Tacos...not a fan of those overrated cafeteria style joints  (*cough Tacos El Gordo *cough Taco y Taco *cough) Most definitely a fan!  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  4"}
{"text":"Place is legit! Robert the owner was very hospitable and food exceeded expectaions! Will def be back!  Fish tacos, and the taquitos were awesome!"}
{"text":"Bomb Tacos are delicious. They earn their name. The best, to me? The fried shrimp tacos, the crunchy potato tacos (deep fried), and the al pastor tacos. Simply the best. Less appetizing were the asada fries, which they did with waffle fries instead of curly fries when I was there because they were out, and the quesadilla. On the former, the fries were greasy and salty. Not a fan.  On the latter, I've had better quesadillas at Rubio's. (But to be fair, Rubio's makes a mean steak and cheese quesadilla!)  Bomb was also out of churros when I was there so I cannot comment on that.  Then again, why run out of dessert, and one for which you are known, on a weekend??  The only other thing to point out is the atmosphere. It is in a strip mall that is not so quaint.  But the decor is super cute. The service is slow but friendly, and you should just leave enough time to enjoy. The music (at least on the day I went) was far too loud and obnoxious. You will quickly ignore this when you get your delicious tacos. The worst part of the atmosphere are the Generation X-ers and millennials that it attracts.  So pretentious and molly-coddled that it makes you unhappy to be around them. I mean, this is metrosexual, entitlement heaven in this place. Gringos galore! I don't mind gringos...after all, I am one.  But when we far, far outnumber Mexicans at a pretend authentic taco place, that's a bit of a heads-up about what this place is and isn't. It ain't authentic, that's for sure. But it is good.  Just stick to what they do best, don't explore the menu, and take your tacos to go."}
{"text":"Small, quiet, taqueria that is away from the craziness of Fremont Street.  They have a wide variety of tacos, two types of salsa (both great) and the sangria was very good.  Service was prompt and genuinely friendly.  The tacos were excellent."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried Bomb Tacos for the first time..The good, they have ALOT of options and good menu to choose from. My boyfriend really like the carne asada tacos and the chicken taquitos. I ordered the shrimp burritos and wasn't really a fan of, it had a sweet taste to it that took away from the shrimp. we also had al pastor tacos but they seemed a little dry. My boyfriend enjoyed the place but for the food I thought it was a bit over priced, we have been to way better taco spots in Vegas. It was okay"}
{"text":"Tacos are ok; although, the rice taste like plastic and beans are always cold. Even so beyond the lack of quality control and care, this place price gouges; 4 dollar for bean and rice, 8 dollar guacamole and 8 for frozen churros. What's even more strange is watching the prices go up. I can't morally and logically give my money to someone like this. However, I do recommend los tacos and frijoles and frescas; food is quality moreover no price gouging."}
{"text":"This is my first time here I ordered my Food to go on a scale of 1-10 I would give this place a 7."}
{"text":"They have amazing customer service, the moment I walked in the lady was very sweet and helpful and their food is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is really good. The wait is not long I ordered 80 dollars worth of food and it was prepared in less than 20 minutes. They make fantastic potato tacos. They need to put up a menu online but besides that it's a great spot."}
{"text":"One of the best taco places around. Definitely has great sauces, and their carne asada is sssooo good."}
{"text":"Amazing! Must try! Flavorful fantastic tacos plus awesome customer service. New favorite spot!"}
{"text":"I can't say that this taco shop would be my first choice to go to, but if it's convenient to your location you should try it. Unfortunately they made a mistake with our order- we ordered 3 al pastor tacos and 4 carne asada tacos and instead received 3 carne asada tacos with the al pastor toppings and 4 al pastor tacos with the carne asada toppings. Not too big of a deal so we ate them anyways, but I was not overly impressed with the quality of the tacos. However, the employees were very nice and I enjoyed the decorations inside. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but again if it's convenient it's a decent shop."}
{"text":"The tacos and nachos were actually da bomb. A little pricey but worth it for sure!  My 17 year old said they were the best tacos ever and we know tacos!"}
{"text":"First time going there. Walked in and met a smiling young Mexican lady.  I have eaten at a lot of Mexican places before but this is authentic and really delicious."}
{"text":"I have tried almost every item on the menu and I have not one bad thing to say about any of it and I honestly don't think I can even pick a favorite item. I love it all. The Rock Shrimp Tacos are delicious, there is something so different and tasty about them. The dressing for the salad is amazing! The guacamole is probably the best I have ever had and for a girl that doesn't typically like red salsa, I could drink this stuff. I don't know how a chicken quesadilla can be so good, but, wow! Did I mention the tacos & burritos are BOMB! Something really special is happening in that kitchen, Robert truly is a genius and you will not find better Mexican food anywhere in town."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this joint for 4 straight days because it's so good!!! My favorite is their grilled chicken tacos with their salsa it's so amazing! Everything tastes so fresh and their customer service is friendly and warm. I love this place so much!"}
{"text":"We loved bomb tacos! After a long day of walking Fremont street, these hit the spot. So fresh and tasty! I had the vegan taco and it was so crunchy and delish."}
{"text":"Try the shrimp diablo tacos !great service and delicious food!  Be sure to ask for the habanero sauce if you like spicy. They also offer vegetarian options which are just as delicious."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good definitely above average. Just based on the food it could get a four or five star however it is in a rough neighborhood, we went right before closing and there were two homeless people right in front of the shop, one of them asked for money. Second is the price, it is about double what you would pay for similar items at other similar restaurants. For example the rice and beans add on is 4.00 and a burrito alone cost 12.00.  We probably will not be eating here again unless there is a Groupon or other special ."}
{"text":"Visited Downtown Las Vegas last weekend and was lucky enough to find Bomb Tacos for an early lunch. My wife and I were hungry and overwhelmed by the 12-15+ taco variations on the menu. We settled for eight and they were all delicious and we could barely finish them.  Tacos I supremely recommend: Fried potato  Rock shrimp Carnitas Barbacoa in the fried shell  The inside of the restaurant is clean and is decorated with vibrant colors.   I can't wait to go back to Vegas and stop by the Bomb Tacos shop on Carson."}
{"text":"Gluten free eater here. AMAZING TACOS!  My husband and I come from a small town with 14 Mexican restaurants so we know what we like. And we loved everything about our order. We ordered Guac, salsa and chips. Fresh fried corn chips, yummy Guac and two types of salsa. My husband loved the red and I loved the green. But it was hard to compare because they tasted amazing.   I ordered the chicken and carne asada. My husband ordered the carne asada and brisket. I ended up with his meal and he with mine. We didn't notice until the end. Either way it was fantastic. It's hard to find good carne asada with good seasoning, these hit the spot. The brisket had a crunchy shell and I loved all the additions. Really made the taco. They are small but don't lack in taste. Each well filling portion. My husband loved his chicken, I recognise by the wide eyes he gets when he finished his first bite. I kept oogling my first taco before I realised he has finished both!  Another customer had received the wrong taco and she sent it back. I got sad, I would have eaten another, regardless what it was. :)"}
{"text":"Finally a place that lives up to its name. We saw this place on eater and decided to give it a try. We had the carne asada, chicken, beef brisket, fish and the carnitas tacos. They were all very good. My favorites where the chicken and carne asada tacos. The place is small but super cute. They were sold out of the Al Pastor tacos, so we'll try them on our next visit. Give this place a try. You'll find something you like and the staff is awesome."}
{"text":"You know a place is good when they nail their basics. Carne Asada taco was through the roof with the little melted cheese addition.  Owner is super friendly and very passionate about his food."}
{"text":"Wonderful tacos. Of all the tacos I've had in Vegas, this tops them all. Saw it on cheap eats, and since it is in my area of town, I went as soon as I saw it. On the show, the guy got the Al Pastore, so I decided to get that, along with the shrimp and the gueros, which I may or may not have chosen due to Beck singing a song with the same name. (*^^*) Anyway, all of them were amazing. The pineapple was perfect on the al pastore, the shrimp had a perfect crunch, and the Gueros having a great cheesy taste. The place can get crowded all of a sudden, so don't come during the lunch rush unless you want to wait in a line. All in all, these tacos are indeed BOMB"}
{"text":"Love the food at Bomb Tacos. Fresh and delish! I Have told many people about this gem. He owners are a pleasure and it would be great to keep them busy. Today is my third trip in 10 days."}
{"text":"Bomb Tacos is the newest addition to my son's list of Taco shops we have been to, and according to him it has rocketed past Fuzzy's to #1. Carne Asada with the perfect amount of char and fresh made tortillas make this place our go to post flag football lunch spot. In addition to great food, it has a cool third world vibe without the risk of a parasitic food poisoning incident.  Try this small taco joint, it's the Bomb!"}
{"text":"Tacos were great.  Love the Fish Taco, and I am not big on Fish anything.  Really want to try the Brisket Tacos next.  I hear they are fantastic."}
{"text":"I was on my way to eat somewhere else and noticed bomb tacos and seen they had vegan tacos as well on the sign out side so right away that caught my eye! Then seen 6$ sangria and I was sold!! Right when you walk in the vibe to me was beachy and cool. There were lots of taco options from mushroom to shrimp diablo.   There were so many yummy options we ordered about 7 different tacos. I will tell you right now the crispy potato taco is sooo delish!  We were handed our drinks and took a seat to wait for our order we didn't wait long but we were greeted while waiting by midget man (that's what he said to call him) to see if everything was ok and assured us our order was on its way and offered to dance for us while we waited haha. He brought us out a extra taco as well because he thought our wait was long, which it wasn't.   As we dug in to our tacos we noticed we were missing 1 taco so we went to tell midget man and he fixed it right away. The manager came out and apologized for the missing taco and offered us some special sauce they made that was a habanero mango Chile it was super spicy but sooo good!!  The manager then brought us out our missing taco plus a extra and still was apologizing but it really wasn't a big deal.  We really liked the place and the staff! Tacos were on point as well as the sauces! Midget man was so cool and definitely made our experience memorable! I will be visiting bomb tacos again"}
{"text":"Stopped off here because it was close by and I wanted to try something local and small. I am usually skeptical about little taco places but this one was pretty good. My kids and husband enjoyed it too. The only thing I would change is that they could salt the beans and rice just a tiny bit more... not really a big deal though. Great experience and would go back."}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Yes! I,m so thrilled I found this downtown gem. Had fish tacos and they were seriously better than any I've had in L.A. or O.C. Fresh affordable and cute - just go!"}
{"text":"YuM! YuM! YuM! OMG so much YuM! Everything is REALLY good, no complaints here! Friendly and fun atmosphere too, very accommodating! Food is so good and customer service and interaction makes eating here a superb experience!"}
{"text":"Wow it's called Mom Taco for a reason the food is incredible the service is impeccable this is the type of place you can come too and really feel like you are with family I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"These tacos are the bomb!  Chef Robert Solano has the freshest ingredients.  Shrimp, Asada, and Pastor Tacos.  Also check out the great Quesadillas."}
{"text":"Holly ymmmies finally a taco place on this side of town that makes you excited to come back and try more the owner came out and personally told us his favorite's and they are amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food quality. They could use work on serving drinks. Keep it up. Get the cane asada for sure. Shoutout to midget man for helping us out super tough. I appreciate you!"}
{"text":"I had a not-so-bomb first experience here and will not be back. Be forewarned about takeout orders. First off, I wanted to order three plates of tacos and some chips and guac, and when I called to place the order the girl on the phone had no idea how to punch in the orders, and we ran around in circles for 15 minutes for her trying to get the order right. It really *wasn't* that difficult or complicated. I told her I needed the order for an hour out, and she said she would get it ready for that time. I knew I wouldn't be there for at least an hour and 15 minutes, but I wanted to make sure it was ready when I got there.  Fast forward, I'm on my way an hour and 15 minutes later and get a call as we're about to pull in- \"Oh hi, your order will be ready in 5 more minutes\"......!!!! Sweet, so they forgot to even start MAKING my order. I get there, go inside, and the woman says 'Oh, just 5 more minutes' and I see them all scrambling in the back to make the order. Great. It's over 15 minutes past when it was supposed to be ready. I took an Uber there with a stop included so I could go in, pay, and get back in my Uber to my destination. Should have been easy.  Proceed to wait 10 more minutes for my order (putting it 25 minutes past when it should have been ready), mind you they were NOT AT ALL busy. They just literally forgot to make my order at the time they should have. And now me, and my pissed off Uber driver, are stuck waiting. They finally finish and I'm out the door with my 6 super small, thrown together tacos, 3 sides of rice and beans, 2 chips and guac for $50. Food tasted fine but GAWD not worth the price or the hassle or the extra tip I had to give my Uber driver for waiting so long.  I literally took extra precautions to make sure it was ready on time- and they still messed it up. So unprofessional.  Thanks bomb tacos. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love their shrimp tacos... come here at least once every 2 weeks... I would eat here every day if I could... super tasty and flavorful with great service always"}
{"text":"Never had it, We looked at the menu at walked out.  $12.00 for 3 tacos?. The cashier never asked us if we had any questions..she just stood there and stared at us..."}
{"text":"I recommend the asada curly fries if you're craving some BOMB fries. A little bit salty and bunch of oil but I'm here for a good time, not a long time."}
{"text":"This is the first time I'm been impressed with a taco spot in Vegas! They use the small taco shells just like I like. Definitely a 5 star for flavor! Chicken and Rock Shrimp were my favorites with the habanero salsa. Be careful it's HOT! Ask for the secret cup of elote.."}
{"text":"Yummy! Finally authentic tacos like you'd have prepared by abuela. Super fresh salsa and guacamole.  We ordered the 3 taco plate with carne asada, rice, beans. We also ordered the chip basket. The tortilla chips were fresh out of the fryer. Greensalsa, red salsa and guac comes with them. The tacos were street style served with cilantro, onion and guac. The meat was well seasoned. The owner was super friendly. The rice is a Guatamalan recipe. The beans are not refried. Things to know:  It is in the strip mall across from Desert Breeze. 7 tables (3 two tops, 4 four tops). Order at the window.  Menu is on chalkboard. Definitely added to our list of favorites."}
{"text":"While at the DMV, I got the craving for tacos and pulled up my Yelp app to seek a Mexican food establishment. I did not have to look very far when I scrolled across and found Bomb Tacos. After finally finishing up there and a jaunt at the park, it's now eating time. This taco restaurant is directly across the street so it's so convenient to where I was. Awesome!   When I came in the cashier at the counter was swamped and informed us that it would be a 20-30 minute wait for our order. I informed here it was fine and placed my order with here. The lobby has Reggie type tunes playing and it is so vibrant feeling while I wait for my bomb tacos. The cashier brought our cokes out to us and directed me that she will bring our food to the table too.  I ordered the 3 tacos tacos with carne asada and I'm not one for all the cilantro and onions so I had them hold these. I only wanted cheese on them and sour cream on the side. When our order got here the steak had a red pigment to it. I was intrigued and first off thought they were undercooked, but was totally mistaken. The red on the steak is how it's cooked and they were delicious. The tacos were street style on corn shells and the steak was perfection itself. The $10.00 a plate for the tacos is so worth it. I can find no better end to the day than with some bomb tacos with green sauce and sour cream. It's perfection at its best!"}
{"text":"It took 25 minutes to get my three tacos to-go order!! I've never waited that long *anywhere*! I could've driven home and back twice. However, the tacos were very tasty. I liked the crispy potato taco more than the two fish tacos. As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the fish tacos are quite soft -- not crispy enough for my taste, but still good. The rice and beans that come with this combo are okay, but I've had better for less money and a shorter wait. I think I'll come back to sit in -- seems like to-go orders are pushed to the end of the kitchen list. Hopefully I can get my tacos fresh off the grill next time."}
{"text":"The food was good not amazing. 3 tacos (tasty but tiny) a few tablespoons each of rice and beans $10.00. Another $2 for a soft drink. The fountain is behind the counter so apparently no refill. $12.98 for a meagre lunch . This price point may fly in Summerlin but not here in working class Spring Valley."}
{"text":"The carne asada curly fries were so bomb! The only thing that sucked was that they got soggy fast but other than that I totally recommend l."}
{"text":"I ordered the curly fries with carne asada and it was BOMB! The horchata was definitely authentic, it even had some cinnamon sticks inside of it which I really liked! The man that took my order (I think it was the owner) was super nice. Food was made fast! I also ordered a chicken taco for my daughter and she loved it. The churros with the ice cream was also really good! I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went there on a late night dinner hunt. It was beyond expectations. The owner explained the menu with enthusiasm and then went to cook our order. Tacos al pastor. Tacos tacos steak. And carnitas. Everything was made quickly and fresh! The tacos are full of flavor and they just melt in the mouth. Portion size was just right and the prices are very reasonable. This place deserves more than 5 stars for a new business that has everything down pat so early! Oh, and they also have real sugar Coke from Mexico instead of the high fructose corn syrup. My new late night spot"}
{"text":"The BEST tacos ever!! Seasoned perfectly!! And the beans and rice were amazing! Authentic Mexican food at a reasonable price! We found our fav place!! The owners are super friendly too!!"}
{"text":"I got 4 tacos (beef brisket, carnitas, asada, and shrimp) and I couldn't pick a fav. They were all so good! Service was awesome as well.  Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great Food! Everything is fresh! Service was quick and cashier was very nice. The salsa station is a little on the small side and was running low but other than that the restaurant was very clean. Only downside is the prices but I guess it's worth it for fresh food. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service is great..  Decor is lively. Tacos are .  I don't drink but my friend said the red sangria was really good!  A must try!!"}
{"text":"Yes the is the BOMB!! Unbelievable.. finally found tasty food in Las Vegas.    The best food and service in Las Vegas.    Food- outstanding.. we ordered Chicken, shrimp and steak tacos. Also a chicken burrito.. the food was absolutely amazing. The best food that I've ever tasted in Las Vegas. We travel here frequently and I've always been disappointed at the food. Some of the most popular places out in Vegas doesn't impress me (food nor service).  Keep in mind I'm from Louisiana where we have some of the best food in the world.  Bomb tacos  This place is off the strip but definitely worth it. The food is so delicious and the prices are great. The service given by Midget Man was beyond amazing. I love to dine at a place that has happy pleasant people with smiles.. The best food and service in Las Vegas.  I will definitely return..   Street paid parking or paid parking in the rear."}
{"text":"Had to try this place based on reviews, plus its close to my house, my husband and i went there sunday for dinner, we took out, cute decor inside, has about 8 tables to dine in, i think the gal and guy in there are the owners, super nice people, its a small menu, which is kinda good, you dont get overwhelmed with a huge menu.  I had the shrimp tacos, came with rice and beans, food was so good! Then my husband had carne asada wet burrito, huge, he still has some left and its tues, lol, and you gotta try the beef taquitos too, or you can get them with chicken.  This place was so good we went there again for dinner monday night, food is fresh, not heavy tasting. A must try if you want some good mexican food."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a coworker. She said that this place was amazing and worth a try. So coming here I already had high expectations. Unfortunately it was a major miss. I got the carne asads tacos, el pastor and the crunchy beef brisket and I split the carne asada fries with friends. It was all overly salted! There were 5 of us who went and all agreed that it was over salted and basically all tasted the same. There was no balance in flavors and we were all sorely disappionted."}
{"text":"Tried this place after driving by downtown. It was SO GOOD!!! The crispy potato taco from the vegetarian menu was pretty good, but the rock shrimp taco OMG it was amazing. The service was great too. Definitely be going back here!"}
{"text":"I've been seeing pictures and posts of bomb tacos on Instagram and had to try it out, it did NOT disappoint! I had the rock shrimp tacos and they were delicious! Midget man aka Alex (DTLV) was an absolute pleasure with his hospitality!! Can't wait to go again 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Fresh chips!!! I had two Rockfish tacos and one fish. They were amazing. Friendly atmosphere and very clean. Bomb Tacos was the \"bomb\"!"}
{"text":"Supposed to be open until midnight, but closed at 10:30pm when I arrived. Personnel inside, but dark."}
{"text":"Well I gotta give them their due...yelp did not disappoint... I had two tacos; one fish and one mushroom   Sucked them both down in the car on the way home ... both were excellent!  They even had real Mexican coke in bottles."}
{"text":"I stopped by just to try a taco before investing in an entire meal. Oh my pastor heaven! This is absolutely some of the best al pastor on earth! It's crispy, the way I like it, not  full of gristle like some places. The cut pineapple and touch of guacamole in incredible! This will be my new go- to place since Serrano's closed."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best tacos places In Town. This places is clean and good. Meats are marinated with lots of flavor! Will definitely continue coming!!!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in strip mall land.  Great selection of lots of street tacos.  Went for carnitas and crispy brisket - both did not disappoint.  Nice service!"}
{"text":"As the name implies, the tacos here are bomb. A little tiny bit on the pricier side but good nonetheless. I'd highly recommend the beans here SOO good. I got the 3 tacos plate that comes with the rice and beans for ten dollars, I think that's a good deal for all the food you get!"}
{"text":"Lives up to the name. Friendly family and delicious food! We got a carne asada burrito and chicken burrito and 6 street tacos. The burritos were huge and seriously good. Go for the food, keep going for the great customer service!"}
{"text":"Craving Tacos after watching the Netflix Ugly Delicious with David Chang and yelped Tacos.  This place came up and with so many stars, I had to try it.    Salsa Bar full of carrots, jalapenos, and onions.   Red or Green salsa and plenty of limes.  Curly Asada fryes came with guacamole, cheese (not the melted nacho cheese which was a disappointment) and sour cream. Won't order again as the cheese goes cold and sticks together.   4 Al Pastor tacos - they added a few pineapples and called it al pastor...hmmm (***)    2 Crunchy chicken tacos - to salty  (***)  2 Asada tacos liked this best as it had a light crunch (****)  1 fried shrimp taco - don't see myself ordering it again. (*)"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place today! The service was wonderful and so was the food. They just hit their one-month mark and I hope they're here to stay.  Delicious authentic Mexican food with great music playing. Be sure to stop by and give them a try. I even love the decor. All in all, this place is SO BOMB!"}
{"text":"This place put me back at home,  eating my Nana's (grandmas) cooked from scratch,  amazing food.  I've had the carne asada tacos and burrito.  Oh em gee! Their carne asada is sooooooo good!! The corn tortillas taste like my Nana's , home  made with amazing flavor.  The carne was perfect work so much flavor. It was tender,  had a nice char in the meat and the flavor explodes in your mouth.  The burrito was huge and fed me twice. Once again,  the beans,  meat,  rice and salsa are all delicious and cooked very well.  My room mate got the shrimp tacos and they were perfect.  My dad was a chef my whole life and here taught me a few things.  Bomb Tacos are definately bomb,  I've been there twice in  2 days and I have no doubt this will be one of my new favorites.  Highly recommended. The staff is incredibly friendly and their service is great."}
{"text":"Bomb Tacos was amazing!!! Super fresh authentic ingredients. The guacamole was fresh and tasty. I got the shrimp taco, chicken taco, and carne asada taco. Hands down the best I've ever had. You won't be disappointed if you eat here"}
{"text":"OMG!  This place is amazing!  The tacos are delicious. The sauces that compliment the tacos are perfect and add a burst of flavor to each bite. I got the chicken and shrimp. My husband got the fish and veggie. He couldn't stop talking about the fish tacos. My two year old loved his quesadillas and rice. We are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for tacos! I had the shrimp diablo, crispy brisket, pastor, and asada. All were excellent!"}
{"text":"Tasty fish tacos with fresh ingredients. Chips weren't as fresh as i had hoped and so were hard crunch rather than a crisp one. However the two salsas were flavorful. Crispy brisket taco was delicious. Friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"The wait for Tacos El Gordo was horrific at BOTH locations.  Maybe I don't remember waiting that long when you're craving it late nights and plus there are no families with kids around at 1 or 2am to order food.  We stumbled into this place after reading the reviews that they were just as good as Tacos El Gordo.    I think they were really really good! I had the chicken and al pastor tacos.  Al pastor was mouthwatering.  The service was great and the food was amazing.  I would definitely come back here for some BOMB tacos."}
{"text":"Bomb Tacos has the bomb tacos!!!! Seriously.... these are some good tacos! I had the crunchy chicken and the al pastor street tacos, both were delicious!!!!! The rice and beans are excellent as well. It took a little longer than some neighboring lunch spots to get your food, but I personally don't mind waiting an extra minute or two for good fresh food that when it arrives is so good you completely forgot about the time it took..... This will definitely be in the regular rotation for tacos!"}
{"text":"The name says it all, Bomb ass tacos. Pastor, awesome, asada, awesome. Will be definitely going back."}
{"text":"Truly authentic flavor, very fresh tasting. We stumbled upon this place while a family member was playing softball across the street at desert breeze park, will surely be coming back!"}
{"text":"These had to be my favorite tacos since arriving in Vegas. I had the crispy chicken and carnitas. Both were awesome and satisfying."}
{"text":"Damn good tacos. Service was great, too. Will definitely recommend and come again. I have nothing more to say but I'll keep typing because Yelp is being annoying and said my review was too short."}
{"text":"I heard about this spot from Instagrammers & other Yelp! Elites so since I was in the area I decided to check it out. It wasn't hard to find it's the next block over from Carson's Kitchen & Donut Bar and next to Vegenation, so it was easy to find.  It was around 8:30 PM on a Thursday night, it was a quiet night for them. We ordered a few tacos and carne asada fries. Just make note that it does take a while to receive your orders so just stay patient. Once everything came out, it was all worth the wait!   The staff is friendly and was helpful in the ordering process. The restaurant was clean and very cute! The style was hipster and trendy. It is a small restaurant but has a decent amount of seating. You order at the counter and choose your seats.   Overall, it was a great experience and I would come back and try more of the menu. I'm definitely coming back when they get their agua frescas!"}
{"text":"You gotta give this place a try. Food is fresh, hot and delicious. Service is awesome. Cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"They are \"bomb tacos\".  My favorite is the mushroom quesadilla. Absolutely delicious an a must try. The place is quaint and clean. Most of the times the owner is working at the restaurant, he is very nice and friendly. I go almost 3 times a week for lunch and thoroughly enjoy anything in the menu."}
{"text":"The tacos are small, the flavors are big and delicious! I had Fish, Carne Asada and grilled Chicken tacos. Both cuts of meat were flavorful and juicy. The Fish was well made, not overfried, very tender and moist.   Easily has become my go 2 for Tacos on the far west side!"}
{"text":"I had the Fried Brisket Taco and a few Carne Asada and Chorizo street tacos. All were excellent, made to order, and fresh!!! Midget Man was awesome at the counter and serving... very attentive. My wife is a really picky eater, so she had a somewhat custom order, which was brought out quickly and correct. The music and atmosphere was nice, even at 2:00 pm when there wasn't much of a crowd. I really like the look of the place on the inside. Easy walk from Fremont. You won't regret stopping here!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great!  I ordered the shrimp tacos and al Pastor. Amazing!  Great food, service and ambiance!  You won't regret it"}
{"text":"We previously dined several times at Chef Richard Solano's Mingo and always enjoyed our meals, but had not gotten around to eating at Bomb Tacos until our recent trip.  I was surprised at how tiny the restaurant is with not much in the way of seating.  A few people were occupying tables while waiting for their takeout orders to be prepared.  We ordered a quartet of street tacos, (2) carne asada, 1 each chicken and pastor.  The tiny kitchen was backed up so we had a very long wait, further exacerbating the shortage of available tables.  Another table was occupied an employee and friend who having their lunch.  We did sample the pickled carrots which were fine, but no better than those found elsewhere and the salsas were pretty ordinary as well.  On receiving our order, we could not distinguish by one taco from another except for the al pastor which was topped with pineapple because all the meat had been diced and fried into oblivion."}
{"text":"Moved here from California 3 months ago and we have been looking for a taco place to frequent. We checked this place out and loved it! My boyfriend, who is super picky, actually got seconds! He agreed that this place would be our new taco place.  We got two chicken and two carne asada to try, and ended up ordering more after we devoured our first order. Check this place out! I recommend it. Also, they have Mexican Coca Cola in glass bottles so, bonus points!!! :D"}
{"text":"This is more of a 3.5 star rating but there were a few cons that really kind of weighed big on this rating.  I've heard a lot of hype behind Bomb Tacos. My office is in DTLV and they just opened their second location and people have been raving. Since this location is by my house, we figured we should check it out.  The service here is great. The people were very kind and were very patient with us because we were definitely trying to order the whole menu.  There were two items that really stood out - the fish tacos and the shrimp diablos! Like those two items alone were phenomenal and I would definitely be back for those! The fish tacos were probably the best fish tacos I have had in LV. The fish is battered perfectly and literally did not require any salsa. Same for the shrimp tacos. They were spicy but also so very good.  Now... I really wanted to love the potato taco but I was really not impressed with it. There was not much flavor and it was just not what I was looking for to fulfill my craving. I also felt this with the fried beef taco. Serious lack of flavor and pretty pricey. We also got carne asada and pastor tacos - both - meh. Also not impressed and the meat seemed either a little old or a little dry. I guess it was either a bad day or a little overpriced. I totally don't mind paying the premium if it's going to be BOMB - but we just didn't experience that.  Lastly, we ordered al pastor fries. Geez - when we were looking at them, we were SOOO hyped! Like YES, this is going to be amazing aaaaaand the fries were old. Legit dried inside. And we are fries people. It looked so great but the fries were legitimately dry! It was so sad!  Great to photograph but we probably ate less than a quarter of it before throwing it away. Sad face for wasting food!  Honestly - I will probably be back for the fish and shrimp tacos but that's about it. Those were bomb for sure, however, the other things, I probably won't be back for. Maybe I'll give the fries another shot one day but I'm still pretty heartbroken over the dryness."}
{"text":"Where can I start with this place? I was really speechless when I saw my food. We ordered gueros tacos and crispy beef brisket. Oh man, the crispy beef brisket costs $3. I wouldn't mind paying $3 for a good taco, but it was so pathetic, it came out fried, bland, oily and a tiny bit of meat. I guess they cared about my cholesterol level: if you have fried food, you shouldn't have more than one piece of red meat.   Gueros taco: just okay, not great, not bad, but I wasn't impressed. Their carrots were super thick, not really my style. Hot sauce isn't too flavorful either. I don't know why they got so many good stars. Or is it just my tastebud is broken? Anyway, it's just not for me. Not coming back.   Oh, I guess I added the second star for them is for their colorful furniture. This place is very small and when we came in, I felt like they had heater on or something, it was so hot, but that's okay for me, as I'm always cold."}
{"text":"Take it from this fluffy guy they have some bomb tacos. This is their second location and I have been to both"}
{"text":"They have vegan options!!!  Try the mushroom tacos or the cauliflower tacos. They also carry aguas frescas."}
{"text":"I still enjoy this place, but after going several more times, I've noticed a pattern of lots of gristle in the carne asada. Way too much gristle. When I tried the carne asada fries, most of the meat was gristle and the remaining edible meat was small, burnt pieces. I'll have to stick to the carnitas until they can trim the carne more thoroughly!"}
{"text":"If you like spicy authentic Mexican food. This place is for you. Their tacos are amazing! I'm not big on eating spicy foods, but man these tacos are good and spicy The first time I stop by I was looking for the Grilled octopus tacos. But they didn't have it so I tried the al Pastor, rock shrimp, crispy beef and carne asada. And they were all pretty good!  The second time I came back specifically for the grilled octopus tacos.  this time I was lucky I got to try them out and they were really good as well. Probably my favorite taco there.  The service was really good everyone was really nice. They are also offered us different types of hot sauce but I had to pass on that. It was already spicy enough."}
{"text":"Wow these tacos really are bomb!!!   My favorite was the brisket taco but everything was delicious.  Even the quesadillas were bomb.    Plus the service was amazing and the space was super cool.   I'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Glad I found this place while visiting Vegas! The brisket taquitos and asada quesadilla were superb, as was the crispy chicken taco. Fish tacos and al pastor tacos were delicious, too! And whatever you do, don't forget a Mexican Coca Cola?"}
{"text":"This review has been long over due. I came here a few months ago but I can remember it like yesterday. I wish I could say everything was so bomb but unfortunately it was the opposite. My friend and I wanted to try something new so I looked to Yelp for suggestions and behold Bomb Tacos was recommended. We were pretty excited to try this place. We arrived around 8pm and placed our orders. There were about 2-3 ppl ahead of us and a group of ppl about 3-4 ppl total dining in so definitely not that busy for a Friday night.  We placed our orders and I was sooo looking forward to the carne asada curly fries the most. We sit at the table right near the register and wait.... I kidd you not, we waited for almost an hr for our food!! We kept seeing ppl coming in and ordering and getting their food before us! I still can't fathom that no one not one single employee asked us if we were okay. Did it not register in their mind wtf we were doing sitting there for that long, oh you know we just wanted to spend our Friday night inside your restaurant and not eat or drink anything. The server didn't think it was odd that she never served us anything at all?  My friend decided to check on our order about 40 min. later and her food was bagged up and ready! But where the hell was my order? They tell her it is almost ready but about 10-15 min. later they tell us they lost my order ticket. I had to place my order again and the owner gave me one taco on the house including a voucher for free lunch for 2 as an apology. So by the time we leave it's been an hr and when we get home my friend's food was already cold and soggy since her order was done way before mine. The tacos and carne asada curly fries weren't BOMB and that's mainly because the whole experience ruined it. I think I was pretty patient that night considering I was 9 months pregnant at the time, LOL. This place gets 3 stars instead of 1 because the owner did apologize and offered 2 free meals but I haven't even been back to use it, in fact I don't even know if I still have it."}
{"text":"Crispy Beef Brisket....I LOVED the way they fried it and chopped it up into little pieces idk how they did that but pretty great. I haven't had anything bad from this taco place yet! I don't think I plan to :)"}
{"text":"Tacos were great!!! Amazing!  Sangria was watered down (deducted star) Prices were high each taco (deducted star - paid $5 for a taco and got a baby scoop of guacamole- my pet peeve from businesses)."}
{"text":"Hands down, absolute best shrimp tacos I've ever had. Best taqueria tacos I've come across so far. The chips are made fresh and the salsas are awesome. Come check these guys out, they can have allll my money!"}
{"text":"Went in to get lunch with my family. Ordered three plates and three drinks. Total was $45. Gave them my credit card and was told there would be a 50 cent fee for using CC. Told them that was ridiculous on a $45 order but they insisted. Told them to cancel and walked out. Ridiculous policy."}
{"text":"This is the best street taco spot in Vegas!! Always fresh ingredients and the woman in the front taking the orders is always so helpful and friendly.  My favorite was the carne asada, but the chicken and fish were delicious as well.  I will be coming here regularly!"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD. We got the bomb nachos and they were possibly the best tacos I've ever had. Also the rice and beans were awesome! Very friendly staff as well! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Yes, the name says it all. Bomb food all around. Ordered carne asada, carnita, and pollo tacos, along with carne asada curly fries. Everything was delicious. Ask for the habanero sauce they keep in the back if you're a spicy lover like me. It actually made me sweat. Coming back."}
{"text":"Flautas are amazing. Chips are hand cut and homemade. Crunchy tacos mmm everything is freshly made and they are super friendly. I call it Mexican soul food"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food in town!! It's all fresh and made to order. Everything I've tried on the menu is fantastic."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Was heading out of town back to AZ and was not disappointed! The service is great and the place is clean. The food was delicious. I forgot to ask if they offer flour tortillas....."}
{"text":"New favorite spot in town! very authentic. There's not too much else to say other than that it's the real deal. Glad I walked in today, will be coming back to bring friends and family"}
{"text":"Wow, I really like the food here, fresh and tasty. A must stop for a taco lover, and if you don't love tacos, you have to try these ones lol"}
{"text":"I love the variety they have here. They have vegan and vegetarian options as well as your typical Mexican food. I love the cauliflower tacos and the shrimp tacos. They serve alcohol here and have chill music making it a really cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"A short walk from Fremont street downtown - the tacos are delicious, fair priced, and the sangria is delicious and loaded with fruit.   Totally worth the visit."}
{"text":"Literally BOMB tacos. Cute little place with a great selection of different types of tacos and they're a good size. The rice and beans are forgettable. My only wish is that the tacos were a dollar cheaper so I could get a few more!"}
{"text":"They live up to their name!!!! Tried this place for the first time today. I had 2 potato tacos and a mushroom taco. Both were Bomb!! Let's not forget the Beans... most authentic tasting beens. Place was clean, fast & friendly. We will back again & again!!"}
{"text":"Came for the tacos, stayed for the loveliest of lovely people working there! They were so attentive and genuinely nice.  Sangria hit the spot! Wet burrito was enormous and delicious!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here A bunch of times all the foods is very good love the street tacos.. The people serving the food work very hard and very pleasant to make your dining experience a nice one"}
{"text":"I was in the area getting an oil change and happened to walk into this place. Small but clean dining area. I ordered pastor and carne asada tacos. Comes with onions, cilantro, and guacamole. The carne asada was delicious! Nice amount of char, very tender and a little bit of fat which is nice. Pastor was pretty good too. Staff was friendly. Can't wait to come back to try other tacos on the menu."}
{"text":"Food is good. Customer service is bad. My child accidentally dropped his just filled horchata and instead offering a free drink or one a small cost, we were asked to purchase one again. I mean it was an accident. I would of expected a different reaction."}
{"text":"Thus far I've tried the fish taco, shrimp, crispy brisket and potato and they are ALL amazing! I got the quesadilla for my kids and there was nothing special about em so I only stick to the tacos! My kids love the potato tacos!  yum"}
{"text":"Ehh food was ok/ good.  I got the Asada fries and while the flavor of the fries was really good it was brought down with the over cooked / burnt meat. The alpastor tacos were good and the asada tacos also ok.  Not wowed, decent 3 stars."}
{"text":"Terrific food. They don't start cooking until you order, took about 10 minutes to get my takeout. On Tuesdays they have a special where you can get 5 asada or chicken tacos for $10, or any 5 tacos for $12. I got asada, carnita, shrimp, and brisket and they were all excellent, with particular nods to brisket (which is a hard shell) and carnita. Next time I'll try their $8 chicken quesadilla.  My 5 tacos weighed in at 1 pound even."}
{"text":"We've enjoyed everything we've had here. The crispy chicken and brisket tacos along with the rolled are super good. I really liked the diablo shrimp too. SPICY!"}
{"text":"I've eaten good tacos at Chelsea market in ny and these are as the name suggest Bomb!!"}
{"text":"The tacos were bomb and the great customer service! And they deliver! Will be back...."}
{"text":"Killer amazing tacos..!! Do yourself a favor and go check it out for yourself, u can thank me later..!!! Seriously best tacos I've had in Vegas yet and I've lived here 20 years.. Super friendly staff and absolutely great food.."}
{"text":"In a city where Tacos can be found up and down several roads east of Las Vegas Boulevard, not to mention on any number of 24/7 Bar menus for prices that frequently exceed ingredient quality, it was not until news broke of Robert Solano's Bomb Tacos opening a second location downtown that the decision to visit his Westside original became pressing, a stop late Friday finding the Chef and his team turning out the sort of Meats and Sauces rarely seen Stateside at prices so affordable.  Open now for just over a year on South Durango across from Desert Breeze Park, a location invisible driving South and hidden going North further handicapped by a subpar website and lack of Facebook Geo-tagging, it is likely surprising to most that Bomb Tacos has actually been around so long in the Plaza also harboring Other Mama and TC's Rib Crib, the simple signage probably not helping matters though those lucky enough to step inside will invariably be rewarded.  No stranger to the local dining scene, Solano's involvement in Mundo at World Market Center probably his most well-known role despite time previously spent at Michelin-starred Topolobampo in Chicago, guests entering Bomb Tacos will quickly find themselves thrust into a space full of hand-built furniture where Spanish tunes play loudly, the menu scrawled in Chalk to one side with additional items including Vegetarian options as well as Beverages also available.  Operating out of a tiny kitchen with no walk-in, the product assuredly fresh and Sauces made \"at least once\" daily as told by the affable owner, it is after assessing the options that diners are invited to make their requests at a window where money is exchanged, a brief wait of no more than ten minutes to follow with some items coming out quicker than others, though those desiring things to be 'coursed out' should make it known when placing their order.   At this time a more full-service space than the one on Carson in DTLV, housemade Jamaica and Horchata for which Solano toasts his Rice to create a complex and nutty finish complimenting a collection of Mexican Sodas, it is wise for any who enjoy Chips and Salsa to begin with a basket additionally carrying made-to-order Guacamole for just $6, the fresh Chips a nice touch even though Tortillas are not made on-site while the dark Red Dip eschews heat in favor of smokiness.  Looking next at the Restaurant's eponymous item, a variety of braised or fried Meats and Vegetables offered beneath fresh toppings including Solano's signature Guajillo Pepper Sauce, it is no mistake that Bomb Taco's best-seller is the Carne Asada listed atop the menu for just $2.25, the cheapest item intended as a hook and barely making its money back considering the tender Sirloin's quality while thinly shaved Al Pastor is also a worthy contender for stomach space given its poignant aromatics that are carefully balanced with cubed Pineapple.   Further impressing with Fried Shrimp set-up against Purple Cabbage, the use of Cilantro Dressing instead of Peppers allowing Crustaceans to shine while those looking for a real punch in the mouth may instead upgrade to \"Diablo\" by way of Housemade Habanero Sauce, it is briefly stepping away from Tacos that guests will find Nachos, Burritos and Carne Asada Fries, the latter as messy as it is delicious with enough crispy coils and Beef to feed a group while the Tomatillo Salsa-soaked Flour Tortilla stuffed with Beans, Rice, Meat and Cheese should also be shared by all but those who are almost starving.  Capping individual Taco costs at $5, both the aforementioned Shrimp Diablo and \"Bistro\" version with Beef beneath fried Eggs still a good value as priced, a hidden gem on the menu is Solano's double-coooked Chorizo that comes as a sliced Link rather than ground and dry like so many others, the intrinsic heat used as an accent rather than overwhelming everything else and arguably the most delicious item available.  Not forgetting those with dietary exclusions, Corn and Flour Tortillas interchangeable, it is with a nod to Vegetarians as well as Vegans that Bomb Tacos additionally offers three Meat-free options including earthy Mushrooms cooked snappy as well as diced Potatoes that mimic the texture of Ground Beef with lots of Seasoning, though those not harboring such restrictions should probably consider the juicy Beef Brisket on a light and crunchy Shell instead.  ****Truly a hard scene to differentiate oneself in, the competition abundant and prices highly variable from Strip to Suburbs, there is no doubt that Bomb Tacos is amongst the West Side's best in terms of authenticity, quality and price - the too loud for comfort music, lack of Dessert or Beer and poor visibility (both online and from the street) notwithstanding."}
{"text":"Bomb Tacos came highly recommended to me by one of my coworkers. As a taco connoisseur, I knew I had to give them a try! Please keep in mind that I ordered only their vegan options.  My friends and I arrived right when the restaurant opened. It was a very strategic move on our behalf to avoid extended wait times. Why did it take approximately 40 minutes to make two orders of carne asada fries and 12 tacos?  I ordered the vegan \"carne asada\" fries and cauliflower tacos. On a positive note, the cauliflower tacos were very innovative and pretty yummy. On a scale from 1-5, I'd give the tacos a solid 3. Now, the vegan \"carne asada\" fries were made with mushrooms instead of beef. I was super excited to try them because I know that mushrooms generally have a meaty taste. They also used curly fries, which are my fave, so I knew it had to be bomb. I'm not sure what was saltier, the mushrooms or the curly fries. One forkful exceeded my entire sodium intake for the day. I thought, maybe I just got a bad batch, but my carnivorous friends had the same experience with their carne asada fries.   Lesson learned: Good things don't always come to those who wait 40 minutes for tacos."}
{"text":"The tacos are delicious, we tried the Vegan tacos and and my sister and brother tried the Carnitas, Shrimp snd Carne asada and really enjoyed it.  We also tried the Sangria and it's s Bomb!!"}
{"text":"I had the carne asada tacos and the potatoes tacos there were delicious. Not bad at all I liked the fact to they weren't greasy like other places. Would go back."}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday afternoon and there was no one there so the service was quick. Order at the window and they'll bring your food out to your table. We ordered -   2 al pastor tacos - meat was juicy, had tons of flavor, and there were chunks of the grilled pineapple with the meat to give it some extra sweetness Carne asada taco - lots of spice on the meat but not heat-spicy, meat was so tender! Mushroom taco - the mushrooms were so hearty and paired well with the salsa, lots of flavor in this one, too Carnitas taco - meat was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside, seasoned just right Shrimp taco - lightly breaded and fried shrimp, had a buttery flavor that was delicious! Cooked perfectly and had a good amount in the taco Crunchy potato taco - filling was like mashed potatoes, topped with cotija and pico de gallo, super crunchy and surprisingly flavorful  Only thing I wasn't into were the pickled carrots from the salsa bar. I usually love them from other places but theirs were soft, almost like they'd been boiled, and had a floral flavor to them. Otherwise, the tacos live up to their name."}
{"text":"Me and my wife tried Taco Bomb and this place was great. It was a really cool place to relax and eat good food."}
{"text":"The best tacos in town !! The best attention of the cashier and the cheffs are the best in the city. Recommended 100%"}
{"text":"The best tacos in the town! And the Server really good!!!! I love this place and the Durango localitation!"}
{"text":"Not sure if we would go back. It was ok...not great but not bad. Cute place, fun tables, chairs and decorations.  Food: I had the 3 taco plate Al Pastor with rice and beans. My man had 3 different tacos, carne asada, brisket and the taco guara (sp). It was a taco in a flour shell.  We shared the Carne Asada fries. The soda machine was out so we had mexican cokes which I LOVE.  The fries were delicious, but the Carne Asada was extremely seasoned...a little too much, overwhelming flavor.  My al pastor tacos were good, not great.  The rice was delicious and the beans were not fully cooked.   My man's tacos were ok he said...when he says ok I know he's not happy. Although the brisket one he really liked! I just don't know if we would go back!"}
{"text":"Just ok. Ordered 3:42pm on Saturday and received 4pm. Taste was ok. Go eat at the truck on Tropicana and Jones. Taste so much better and cheaper. Again, it was ok."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The tacos were really bomb. My husband and I were prepping for our wedding but we're craving Mexican food so we decided to go there and see what healthy alternatives there were. We had great fish tacos that tasted fresh and had a lot of flavor. We also got the mushroom quesadilla which tasted just like a steak quesadilla. Clean place and the owner was really sweet too."}
{"text":"Tacos are so freakin' good carnitas are the best with carne asada and brisket a close 2nd. People are super friendly and the ingredients are high-quality. Don't expect super cheap taco truck prices but very reasonable for the quality. Get some!"}
{"text":"Saw this place months ago and decided to try it tonight. I usually don't like authentic Mexican food but this place has the best authentic Mexican tacos I've ever eaten. I tried four different tacos which was the carne azada, al pastor, shrimp, and the fish taco. I liked them all except the al pastor because I'm not a fan of pineapples combined with meats. Their horchata is pretty good, it's not too sweet like other places. I'll be back to try the Asada curly fries"}
{"text":"This is mainly for the service. Just left there and could not have had worse service . For some reason the cashier keeps taking orders instead of making sure people have their food . Ordered 2 cokes. She said we would get right away . Had to ask after people after us had gotten their drinks . Got served our tacos And rice before chips , guacamole , salsa . No napkins , no spoon or fork for the rice . Again had to ask . Had to ask for our chips , guacamole , salsa . Takes 2 more orders before she gets them for us . Chips were over cooked . Asked for coke refills since there was so much Ice I couldn't even get my straw in my cup . She proceeds to leave our cups at register where we put them to help yet another customer who was after us and get him his refill first . Tacos are very good . Your cashier/waitress needs some help doing her job .. maybe she is overwhelmed . That was ridiculous. Tipped her nearly $3 when I ordered and couldn't even get a have a nice night. The bomb tacos downtown is amazing ! We will go there if we go back ."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a new experience with Mexican.  I was driving down S Durango and took a chance on Bomb Tacos. Nice place the manager Robert was very inviting and pleasant. I ordered a couple of carne asada tacos and he asked me would I like to try  any of the other tacos I told sure ive kind of been stuck on carne asada tacos for a while he  turned me on to two other kinds tacos that they had and they will also great fish and chicken. There you haven't he let me know he wanted my business and Bomb Tacos is now my go-to for Mexican."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've actually written a yelp review anywhere, but this place was worth it. I tried the carnitas, fish and carne asada tacos. The carnitas was my favorite but they were all delicious. They have great service, even when it started to get busy. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"All I can say is that this place literally lives up to its name...they're tacos are seriously BOMB!   Prices are very reasonable and come in at or below what many places charge for their \"Taco Tuesday\" deals! Lol $2.25 a taco isn't bad at all!   My bf and I got the vegan cauliflower and potato tacos and tried the vegan mushroom \"asada\" curly fries and were seriously blown away! The cauliflower tacos were perfection (my mouth is watering thinking about them lol) and I liked them so much I had to get another order of 3 more! Haha Someone in our group for the beef brisket tacos and really loved it so that's also a definite must try!   Nice and casual ambiance and conveniently located in area with lots of parking nearby! Definitely come here whenever you're craving for some delicious tacos!"}
{"text":"Came in here on a whim with a craving for tacos but also not wanting to travel too far to my normal taco spots, and I've gotta say that Bomb Tacos definitely satisfied my craving.   Seating is pretty limited, but the space is so inviting & vibrantly decorated. Customer service was amazing. The cashier and (I'm assuming) the owner were extremely friendly and helpful in explaining their menu since this was my first time coming here as well as my friends'. They do offer combo plates, typically with 3 tacos served with beans and rice, but my friends and I decided to go with their a la carte menu since we wanted to try a variety of their tacos.   Out of the four that I ordered- carnitas, al pastor, rock shrimp, and crispy chicken- the al pastor and crispy chicken were definitely my favorite; however, all four tacos were extremely flavorful. I also tried the fish taco that my friend had ordered and it was AMAZING. Like, my mouth is watering thinking about it. The flavor profiles of all the tacos were so delicious, and you can tell that all their ingredients are fresh. I also ordered their horchata which is homemade, and OMG I need more of it in my life.  The owner (again- I'm assuming since I didn't ask for his name) brought over to our table two of their homemade habanero salsas. While I didn't personally try them, my friend is able to vouch & say that they both complemented the tacos exceptionally well & didn't compromise the flavors of the tacos.   All in all, Bomb Tacos definitely lived up to the name & did not disappoint at all. I am already planning my next trips since I'm determined to try everything on the menu while sipping on horchata."}
{"text":"Didn't have a chance to take a picture, but the spot was nice. Staff was super friendly! My husband had  veggie/vegan tacos. They were pretty dam amazing. I had a combination plate to split with my daughter. 2 tacos de carnitas and one de apastor with rice and beans. Everything was so delicious! Owner was very friendly and talkative. Right near freemont."}
{"text":"Just had to try a place with local fare so we still had gambling money. I had the fish taco and the Diablo shrimp taco; both were excellent and freshly prepared and the flavors . . .! My hubby had the 3 Taco plate with chicken tacos and enjoyed his as well. Next time we visit Vegas we will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely, categorically the best tacos in Las Vegas. Will never eat Mexican again at any place other than Bomb. The owner knows what he's doing! Try Bomb. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bomb Tacos is one of the best places on the map, it has good Food, the people are nice, the flavor is fantastic, and has California Taco taste. If you don't care much about full authenticity, then this is the best place to be. The Crunchy chicken with the soft tortilla was a great blend and the carnitas flavor was authentic as well as the al pastor, the rice and beans soft and tasteful. We will definitely come back in the future and to the people who haven't gone reading this review we recommend coming here in the future or soon."}
{"text":"The food was just ok. The prices are too high for the size of the portions, and the restaurant itself. The restaurant is small, very casual, and imitates a street taco style. There is only one kind of salsa at the salsa bar and no free chips are given. $7 for churros and ice cream? We left hungry and disappointed after the amount of money we spent at this place. Forgot to mention, we waited a super long time to get our food."}
{"text":"They have so many taco options and great vegetarian and vegan choices too! The wet burrito is enormous, but a little on the spendy side as it was $12. The rest of the menu was reasonably priced. It's a cute little restaurant with a friendly and good vibe. Definitely a must try if you are downtown."}
{"text":"So, I was referred to go here by a client of mine and it was such amazing food I was so grateful! I'm heartbroken they aren't a 5 star location because they absolutely deserve to be! The cost isn't bad the picture I attach was only $10 and I was stuffed! The quality was so good I'd hope they keep the prices high, heck I'd be will to pay $15 for my meal. My family and I hope to eat here for many years!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to local taco place in the valley. The al pastor is enough to go back to. They have a solid soft taco game and the crispy brisket is awesome.  Service is great! I know its a casual place but there is genuine concern for customer satisfaction. 5/5 will go back and eat here again."}
{"text":"Excuse my bias, but I went in here prejudiced.   I figured I would give it a 4* review.   4 stars is standard for an upscale taco place - - one with a 'creative' menu, where you pay somewhat more than at a barrio taqueria,  but basically, you are getting tacos.  And after having the tacos, you say, \"well that was different - - I like what the did with the [fill in some random aspect here]\".  But, basically, you just had some upscale tacos.  Despite my most curmudgeonly disposition,  I have to bow my head in respect.   Yes, the menu is every possible shade of 'creative'.   Yes, in the end,  you get tacos, with a twist.  But wow are the people there great - - the person taking the order had real heart.   The person serving the tacos, and asking if everything is OK,  had real heart.   The tacos were, in fact, not just creative,  but wowsville subtle.   Gems of perfection.   Works of bloody art.  Call me jaded, call me curmudgeonly,  but this is great food, served up by great people.   5 total stars."}
{"text":"Is call bomb tacos for a reason. This place is legit great food. Super fresh and delicious. I've been coming here twice a week. Price is fine for me since I know they use fresh ingredient. Customer service was really friendly."}
{"text":"Came back and the service was fabulous and way more efficient than last time. The tacos again were delicious! I tried the Baja shrimp tacos and absolutely loved them. The presentation was good and the taste even better. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Have lived in the Summerlin area for nearly a year, and can't believe it has taken me this long to find Bomb Tacos! Casual vibe and awesome eats. Vegetarian options at most taco places are usually pretty pathetic, but Bomb has you covered with their fried cauliflower and crispy potato tacos. Tried both and was not disappointed! Amazing flavor, filling and at a price that's hard to beat ($3 per taco). Must try!!"}
{"text":"These are great tacos but is it worth the wait? Some would say yes, actually a lot of people said yes. Well, the tacos are definitely b0mb! I've taken out of town friends here and they all agree that these are some great tacos. Don't forget to try other stuff, they are all equally delish and if you like spicy like I do, try all their sauces! My bf's mom always said the secret is in the sauce and I don't doubt that!"}
{"text":"Really delicious rock shrimp tacos! My son loved the carne asada tacos as well. Very friendly and cute place!"}
{"text":"VEGANS!!!!! I haven't had an amazing taco since I was 8 years old and when I say their tacos are a must! THEY ARE A MUST! they are so good I had the mushroom street tacos! They were amazing! They staff was great and very attentive! Hopefully they expand to LA soon!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly expensive--$12 for three tacos with small sides of rice and beans. If you're going to charge that much, the food had better be good. Luckily, the food is actually good, quite tasty in fact. I had the rock shrimp tacos, which were filling and had an ample amount of flavor to them, with fresh-tasting ingredients. The guy who took my order (owner, I am guessing) was very friendly, too. So, despite my reservations about the price point, I'll give this one a thumbs up."}
{"text":"The tacos here are amazing. They have traditional street tacos as well as daily unique specials. We came in last night and had the al pastor and rock shrimp tacos. They were both excellent but we did favor the rock shrimp. They mentioned their specials tonight would be pork belly and grilled octopus tacos so we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I actually tried to eat at The Rice Bowl which is in the same complex, but they were closed. So I walked over to the Bomb Tacos and I'm pleasantly surprised! The tacos are the Bomb! I ordered only one fish taco and devoured it. So, I ordered another! Muy Bueno!"}
{"text":"I don't usually go to many Mexican restaurants because it's so hard finding one with a true authentic taste - Bomb Tacos is different! The Shrimp tacos here are like none you ever had before!"}
{"text":"Tried bomb tacos at the taco festival and wow the fish tacos were bomb. Whenever I'm close by the actual restaurant I will definitely stop by and get more bomb tacos!"}
{"text":"Yummy!! Thank the YELP pioneers for coming through again.. we had their shrimp and fish taco combos and it hit the spot!  You can taste all of the amazing veggies and herbs.. The beans and rice were incredibly flavorful.. we'd visit again - when we're in the area.."}
{"text":"I've only had takeout from this place twice so far, both times the food was excellent. Very flavorful and fresh, carne asada fries is as amazing as everyone says. If you are in the area, make sure to try this place."}
{"text":"Best place ever for tacos! Al pastor tacos were amazing!! I will definitely come back here again"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place out on our way home. We have missed our taco spot back home so much and other place weren't cutting it on our side of Vegas so what the heck lets try it. We purchased four Carne asada tacos which came out to $9 and some change (ouch a little pricey). We also waited 15 mins for our order. As we were waiting my husband whispered \"Wtf these tacos better be the business.\" Lol finally we received our food and you know what is was worth it. Best tacos that I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical of the name when I first ate here.  Months later and I eat here at least once a week.  I lived in LA for 15 years and Vegas is pretty lacking in good Mexican...it's really really good at this place, lot of love in the food and the lady running it is super nice."}
{"text":"Seriously bomb! We tried about 5 varieties of tacos, and most of them were amazing! My favorite were the carne asada and shrimp tacos, and the carne asada curly fries were awesome. My one gripe would be that I found everything just a bit too salty, but that didn't stop me from enjoying my meal. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Would rate it 2.5 for customer service.  The staff was friendly but I wouldn't consider this an \"authentic\" Mexican restaurant.  I ordered the 3 taco platter with one shrimp taco, one carnitas taco, and one carne asada taco.  The only one that actually had flavor was the shrimp taco. My husband got the asada burrito and rated it a six on a scale of 1-10.  We got our food pretty fast but they literally had no condiments. No limes ,  no salsa ,  no nothing. Everything was out of stock.  It wasn't until we were getting close to finishing our food that they restocked it.  They only restocked the salsas, they didn't take out any limes.  What are tacos without lime and salt ?! It also took us a while to find the trash can which was all the way in the back of the house by the restrooms.   (They only had one trash can).  The cashier was very nice and friendly but I just feel like the hospitality was not there.  They only offer salsa and pickled jalapeños for your tacos.  No limes or anything else.  It is a little small taco spot which is understandable but I feel like I would not come back. For what they offer , their prices should be a lot less.  $40 for a burrito and 3 tacos w/ 2 fountain drinks is ridiculous ."}
{"text":"Did somebody say tacos, I mean Bomb Tacos???? This place delivered just that :-P My husband & I visit the Las Vegas area a few times a year traveling from the Bay Area, California. During our last trip (Oct) it was a must to find some legit tacos (all past locations we were left disappointed, felling that Vegas doesn't know how to do tacos). Coming from an area with a huge Mexican / Latino community the bar is set pretty high. I consider myself a taco snob, meaning my last meal would be tacos.   We arrived just as they opened, and was immediately greeted by staff. Together, we got a combo of carne asada, carnitas, & fish tacos. While waiting for our order, Robert (owner) came out to chat it up with us a bit. We were talking about where we're from, and that he has interest in San Francisco.... and asked how an establishment like his would do in our area with such huge competition. This place feels more like a taqueria for hipsters, and with the right location, it would be a hit.   Here comes the food. My mouth immediately begins to salivate as the plate reaches the table. Since it was so early, the salsa bar wasn't quite ready, but Robert served us some to our flavor preference. As we took our first bite, my husband & I eyes met, seeing straight through them reading BOMB Tacos. They were delicious!!! Robert offered a bit hotter salsa from the back, a habanero salsa. He did place a verbal warning on it. Pffft, the hotter the better, and it was amazing. The quality of ingredients was recognized and makes Bomb Tacos presence be known.   We knew immediately that we will be back each and every time we are in the area. Awesome food, awesome personable service, with a trendy atmosphere. Thank you Robert, and kuddos to your kick ass spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent brisket tacos and the owner was very gracious!  We liked the purple cabbage on the tacos as well."}
{"text":"Wonderful little authentic taco shop. Locally owned by a husband and wife that provide a wonderful and friendly environment."}
{"text":"This new addition to Downtown Las Vegas really does live up to its name.   Service: BOMB Decor: BOMB Prices: BOMB  Food: BOMB DIGGITY!!  This place is in an excellent spot for me to frequent on my lunch. Don't be scared away by the street parking which you have to pay for, this place is worth it! Upon entering this vibrant establishment, you will see a menu filled with many taco options that may leave you torn as they all look so savory. You could do what I did and get various types to enjoy. I ordered the Rock Shrimp, The Gringo, and the Carne Asada. Be careful to read the menu carefully because different tacos come with different tortillas. Either way, my choices were....they were...well...BOMB! All the ingredients were properly situated in their rightful tortillas and ready to be enjoyed by my tummy. The meats and shrimp were juicy and flavor packed. The team member at the counter is so helpful and funny.  This is has for sure been added to my lunch spots go to and should be for anyone who works in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos!  We ordered for a large party and everyone loves their tacos especially the veggie/ vegan ones!  Will be our go to for tacos!"}
