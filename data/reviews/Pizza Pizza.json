{"text":"So it's not the most delicious pizza in the world...but it's super fresh, super customizable, super fast, and super cheap.  Special right now gets a large pie, 10 wings, and 4 sodas for $22 (after tax)  which is insane.  I say well worth the price."}
{"text":"not a fan...we used to like pizza pizza but this location consistently turned out crust that seemed to use old flat dough...burnt a few times as well.  go elsewhere..."}
{"text":"Wow.  Surly counter staff at its finest.  I'm just glad she didn't strangle me to death while ordering.  It's like what you would feel from a surly teenager.  Except she was a middle aged adult.   Seriously though. Pizza is fine. Despite their attitude I would still come back for the pizza.  I agree with one of the previous reviewers.  The pasta is absolutely horrible.  Undercooked and expensive.  Please do yourself a favor and stay with the pizza.  I made the mistake once.  Better to just microwave a michellina s.  Much better.    At least its not racism. They treat all customers equally poorly regardless of color or gender."}
{"text":"Really bad service. It's common knowledge that Pizza Pizza has a money back guarantee for getting their orders delivered on time. I unfortunately learned that when they fail to deliver the order, they don't actually keep their promise.  While their pizzas don't taste particularly bad, a store that can't keep their word isn't one I'm willing to go to. There are plenty of Pizza Pizzas in the area. Just don't go to this one."}
{"text":"Even for pizza pizza standards this place is very bad. Consistently bad.   I have gone several times and the staff (late nights usually served by a very impatient and cut as many corners as possible lady) are rude and uncaring in providing quality food and service on a consistent basis.   For example:  -they are rude talking to you  - they don't adequately answer questions - they deny the most basic requests such as adding garlic powder  - they are not even finished with your order such as asking what drinks and dips you want but they already ask the person behind what they want while still punching my order. Needless to say I waited more than normal for my purchase to be completed and the guy behind me had to repeat himself later once the cashier was truly available  - pizza is really bad for pizza pizza standards - they claim they didn't have napkins and instead put a roll of paper that due to the self serve nature was stained in pizza sauce   And the worst the pizza had : - very big dough - was soggy - looked plain because they were so skimpy on the toppings"}
{"text":"Horrible pizza place for having it twice in their name its definitely not good pizza will never choose pizza pizza again"}
{"text":"This is my local P.P.  It's big,clean and the staff do a good job of cleaning the washrooms. I rarely have anything negative to say about the staff or the cleanliness of P.P. but the food has gotten worse over the years. Why does the sauce taste so sweet? Why does it taste like crappy no name ketchup the next day? What the heck is the ground beef made from because it sure doesn't taste like beef? Why are my pizzas always burnt on the bottom? Why are the pizza slices so stale? Why do the wings have so much fat? What's wrong with the dough, it's too damn chewy?   I can keep going but if you've eaten there you would have experienced a few of the above by now. P.P. needs to get back to basics and address complaints by their customers."}
{"text":"Great place if you are in a hurry to catch your flight. This Pizza Pizza is quick, fast, and easy to get to. I have never had a major problem here, except when there is a line, you might as well skip this place, and head somewhere else. The service is slowish, and the staff need to be more trained. Another minus, you have to pay extra for parmesan cheese for your pizza!!"}
{"text":"NEVER. EAT. HERE.   My boyfriend and I have been ordering from here a lot in the past year. Pizza Pizza isn't great quality in general, nothing fancy, just some standard pizza. And that's what we were getting... Until recently.  The past dozen times we ordered, they've screwed something up. Missing cans of pop. Missing dips. Mediums instead of larges. Completely wrong orders. Late delivery, with no free pizza. Driver coming with no change (no  I'm not tipping you $20, yes, please go get change... I mean, seriously?) But what happened tonight was INSANE.   We ordered 2 panzarottis, his with just cheese and chicken (borrrrinnnggg) and mine with spinach, mushrooms, sun dried tomato, and extra cheese (yum).   They arrive nearly 40 minutes later. One looks alright, the other is dark brown, cracked and crumbling. This one, of course, is mine. I cut it open and discover that there is no spinach inside. Also, not much of anything else. Barely any cheese at all, let alone extra cheese. Basically just a wad of over cooked, greasy dough with a little bit of sauce smeared on it.   So I asked my boyfriend to call customer service. He did, they apologized, and said they'd call the store and have them send a new one.   The store called me moments later.  \"We don't have spinach. What do you want?\" oh... You didn't have spinach, so you just sent the first one without it, even though I paid for it? \"I called. You didn't answer. So what do you want?\" No, you didn't call. My phone has been right next to me the whole time, turned up as loud as it goes... can I have all new toppings then? \"No. I already started making it. WHAT DO YOU WANT? YOU WANT POP?! YOU WANT DIP?! WHAT?\" No, I'd just like new toppings. I paid for 4 toppings. I'd like 4 toppings, please. \"Oh my God. FINE. WHAT DO YOU WANT?!\" You know what, never mind. I'd just like a refund. \"You already ate 2 panzarottis, what, you want it for free?! You're a beggar?! You beg me for free food?\"   At this point, I tell my boyfriend to call customer service again.   The guy at the store continues calling me a beggar, and then... \"YOU'RE A FUCKING BITCH!\" and hangs up.   Made a complaint with customer service, but they really didn't seem to take it seriously. They also wouldn't refund my money, and would only give me a $10 credit (which is less than I spent in the first place) that I will never use because they've lost a customer.   NEVER. EAT. HERE."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from them today, and I had a bad experience. Not only was part of my order ignored, and therefore I didn't get it (but thankfully not billed), but the driver was pretty rude and acted inappropriately.  The driver took my credit card from me and cut me out of the payment process (he scanned the NFC chip when I explicitly told him I didn't want that). When I vocalized his error he said I should call head office. Okay fine.  I called Pizza Pizza and told them what happened, and they agreed that the driver shouldn't have done what he did.  I did order a pizza and I did recieve my order but the driver should not have taken his own liberties with my payment processing after I articulated what I didn't want done. I won't be ordering from here anymore."}

{"text":"Was extremely sick after eating a slice of deluxe pizza. It was late at night and the slices were probably sitting out for a while. Used to order from here only because how close it was to my house. Was never satisfied with their pizzas, always soggy crust even when asked for well done. After the food poisoning I will never eat from this place again!!!"}
{"text":"Many times I have been wronged by this company before I got angry enough to write a review.  First: I have ordered for delivery, and they don't even bother to show up. Three times this has happened.  Second: I order for delivery, they don't show up, I get cheesed (pun!) and call in. The delivery guy claimed they came, buzzed our door and no one answered. Riddle me this, I live next to the door, and can see and hear every guest entering from every room of mine. How did you arrive with me anxiously peering out the window for my pizza, buzz my 1960's scary loud buzzer and I magically some how am not there.   Those times, let it slide. Today though, I am fed up. I call in a pick-up special for a XL pizza, one topping. I choose green peppers and add the Italiano seasoning blend because I love it.  I arrive, pick it up, get home and take a bite. They literally dumped a whole bottle of the seasoning on the pizza and it is covered in salt.   I call in, literally 2 minutes after I walk in the door to complain. They offer me to go pick up the same exact pizza, or 5$ rebate. Let me get this straight, you made a mistake, yet you want me to make the whole trip BACK to your store to get the SAME pizza that, to be honest, made me now hate green peppers. I ask for just a cheese replacement (saves them toppings, no?). Apparently not, that is unacceptable and not in 'their policy'   What is in their policy apparently is when I hand the phone over to a man and within 10 seconds they agree to make a pizza, just cheese, and delivered. Yet me, a female must 5$ return policy, even if I beg and plead for literally a 15 minute phone conversation. We used the same tone, same level of irritation, yet somehow he has more pull.  Interesting I think.   Bottom line: You lost a lot of customers today. I had a party of guests who were disgusted with the quality of customer service and they are defiantly high-consumers of pizza and will not be getting Pizza Pizza again."}
{"text":"I am writing this review after them getting the order wrong again.   Last time I accepted their mistake and took a thick crust pizza even though I ordered a thin crust.  (last week I ordered a salad with extra chicken, which they forgot to add. Too much hassle to go back and discuss that)   This time I made a fuss. If you get the order completely wrong, how exactly did you have the order ready within 20 minutes ?  One of the ladies who works at the till, as usual, was very polite and the other was a fire-breather.  The other lady and the guy who made the pizza, basically insinuated I was blind saying I \"claimed\" it was not thin crust. He said he used the thin crust dough and acted as if I was robbing his savings account.  I left after getting confirmation my card would not be charged (will check my statement just in case.)   Avoid, Avoid."}
{"text":"Don't bother getting pizza from this chain of stores. Crust is like cardboard would rather eat the box then the pizza in it."}
{"text":"The staff were very friendly, but the pizza wasn't very good. Maybe I just have high standards for pizza, being from NY.  Not the worst pizza I've ever had, it would definitely be okay in a pinch when you're super hungry, but it's not anything to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"Every time i use SPC card deal ($2.99 for slice and drink) this one lady doesn't give me the drink until i ask for it. She says \"here you go\" and walks away without giving me me drink until i have to ask (every single time) \"does this come with a drink?\" She's done this every time i go there. once, she served me without the drink and then started taking the next customer's order. Why is she trying to rip me off???  The same lady gave me like half a portion of fries knowing i was getting them to go."}
{"text":"Amazing,    If and only if, to you cardboard, slapped with \"something\" resembling tomato paste, and hosed down with filth is your idea of a delicious meal.  If you value your money, intestinal fortitude, and self-respect...  you'd find something better.  Or just don't eat.   How this chain exists is beyond me.  I've had multiple workers at different locations tell me \"you'd be stupid to eat this... \" while recommending whatever was on special (sometimes it was marginally passable).  If I'm going to feel like a fat - fuck, and engage in carbicide, it better be something that tastes better than whatever the hell this tastes like.  Garbage. It's what's for dinner."}
{"text":"Came to order at 11:56am and door was locked. Staff inside still cooking and he motioned with his hands that there was no food. But could see made pizza slices in their display. Poor customer service for such a busy area"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this pizza pizza location quite frequently in the past. On my most recent visit, I had one of those free coupons to receive a box of wedges or dip or cans of pop. I proceeded to order several medium pizzas, and use my coupon to get a free box of small wedges. Everything was fine so far. So after I pay and receive my receipt, the lady who took my order went to their freezer (which was beside the deep fryer) and drops the box of frozen wedges on to the ground. Now this is where it gets ugly. She proceeded to take those wedges and put them into the fryer basket, and fries them. Me, being the only person who ordered wedges at the time, confronts her and asks why she didn't throw them out. She responded with \"they're not for you\". Yeah...I asked for 3 cans of pop instead. And never ever returned to this pizza pizza location."}
{"text":"The pizza at this location is flavorless as a lack of even an adequate amount of toppings- especially their individual slices. Almost no cheese, chicken pizzas have next to no meat on them. Pizza Nova is quickily gaining ground on Pizza Pizza and operators like this are to blame."}
{"text":"Food is usually as good as any pizza pizza (which is meant to be a compliment) however this review is negative because their staff are so grumpy and unapproachable.  Every time I'm there I get attitude from the person at cash. Might stop going if you people don't learn to give free smiles."}

{"text":"Manager is disgusting. Had plastic cooked into a cheese pizza. We called pizza pizza and they gave us a 25$ credit. When I tried to go back the manager harassed me and suggested next time I have plastic in my pizza I should come to him and he will give me $1000. Can't go back without being harassed."}
{"text":"They always seem to forget something. Forgot my wedges...delivery guy came an hour later.   Last time they forgot the dipping sauce.   Pizza was good though better than most pizza pizza places"}
{"text":"I hate this place I ordered pizza to pick up after work look what I found when I got home I swear the oil was dripping of the slice I think who ever made that pizza dropped a bottle of oil on it then he just didn't care."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Pizza Pizza in the city, with despicable behavior from management being the norm. The pizza is usually under cooked when ordered and the slices are like cardboard after being reheated for take out."}
{"text":"went for pizza takeout today. rude cashier,  dough felt under-cooked, toppings decreased in size & lacked cheese layer. i used to like ordering from this branch. what happened?  change in management? i wont be going back."}
{"text":"Very good service and best pizza in town! extra super points about having it gluten free!"}
{"text":"This store is absolute crap. I ordered a large pizza, 3 pops, 3 dipping sauces etc. The pizza came 30 minutes after we ordered it, and the delivery driver forgot the pops and sauces. He completely ignored the special instructions listed, and came to the front door, which caused the dogs to start barking causing everyone in the house to wake up at 12:30am. The driver said he'd go back and get them. We live max 8 minutes away from the Pizza Pizza store. The driver took 40 minutes. When he came back, he only brought the drinks, and forgot the sauces, again. We've called customer service about 4 times. All of them being little to no help. Their policy regarding missed items is useless. Our pizza sat there and got cold along with the rest of our order. When the driver came back 20 minutes later with our sauces, he called my cell phone as first requested and said \"do you want me to just leave them outside?\". After our pizza was cold and gross, all we got was a 5$ store credit from customer service. Absolutely pathetic. Never ordering from pizza pizza again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Got here fast. To fast. Food was NOT COOKED. Half moon cheese bread was NOT COOKED. UNDER COOKED. Deep fried pickles were UNDER COOKED NOT COOKED. Soggy and frozen.  Food was disgusting. I will not be returning or ordering delivery here ever again. Waste of money. YUCK."}
{"text":"Your average Pizza Pizza place. Ask for extra cheese on the pizza, and you will get a LOT of cheese! We went in to order carry-out, and we were quite pleased with the wait time. We only waited about 10 minutes for our pizza and wings."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, employees are friendly and kind  They don't cut back on toppings like other locations. Pizza always tastes good and whenever there's a problem they're very quick to fix"}
{"text":"The in-store customer service here is horrible. Today I found both a cashier and the manager (Rahman) to be unhelpful and unknowledgeable. Upon presenting my Pizza Pizza loyalty card and my credit card before ordering a pizza, the cashier failed to take the loyalty card to swipe it; she didn't even ask for my loyalty card. After I tapped my credit card on the credit-card machine and was given a receipt, I asked her to swipe the loyalty card. She indicated she couldn't do so; that I didn't ask her first beforehand. I corrected her by stating I had presented both cards to her and that her responsibility is to ask customers if they have a loyalty card. I asked her to refund the charge to my credit card so that we could start all over again--I was perfectly willing to go through the whole process once more, just as long as I received credit for the purchase. She explained that she couldn't process a refund. She went to speak with her manager, and he came over. He explained that once the credit-card transaction goes through, there can be no refund, or reversing, of  the charges. The cashier suggested that the next time I was there, she would \"punch the card twice,\" her not realizing how impractical and ineffective this remedy was. I indicated to the manager I would call the head office. So I left the store with my credit-card receipt--at least the manager wrote his name on the back when I asked--and with no pizza.  After being on hold for 15 minutes before I got through via telephone (416-967-1111) to a Pizza Pizza customer-service agent, I discovered that Pizza Pizza \"isn't responsible for what happens at the store level.\" The agent could not answer some simple questions: 1. Are refunds offered to in-store customers who pay by credit card? 2. Are refunds offered on credit-card purchases if an in-store employee makes a clerical error and overcharges an in-store customer? 3. Can in-store employees cancel a transaction? 4. Should I call my credit-card company to have the charge to my card reversed?  I did find out that the agent herself could not reverse the credit-card transaction, as any unfulfilled credit-card orders at the store would be discovered by end of day, resulting in a credit-card refund two or three days afterward. I expressed my disappointment that she couldn't answer most of my questions; I indicated I would call the head office (416-967-1010).  The gentleman I spoke with at head office told me that the manager and any in-store employees are able to void a credit-card transaction in a case like mine, as well as in the case when a customer changes her mind in the middle of an order. He too repeated that Pizza Pizza is not responsible for store-level operations. However, he had the authority to reverse the charges on my credit card, with the proviso that I would have to wait to see the transaction in my account."}
{"text":"I'm not a snob against Pizza Pizza, but this one has the absolute blandest pizza I've had from this chain. Even after I added some of the provided seasonings and chilli flakes, it was pretty bad. Also they have began to really skimp on the toppings (you should see how thin/small everything is) and cheese."}
{"text":"I have ordered pick up and delivery from this Pizza Pizza about half a dozen times. Every single time the pizza has been correctly made, prepared and delivered or picked up quickly, and the staff has always been very pleasant. This is a great pizza pizza location."}
{"text":"Service is good. Hours of operation are good so you can get something to eat even during late night when you return home. But like some people have commented, I have experienced going to the bathroom as well after eating from here. The cheese is too heavy sometimes.   Some of the other sauces and toppings were very delicious. I would have given 5 stars if me and my family didn't have to run to the bathroom whenever we ate from here."}
{"text":"They delivered a pizza with pepperoni on it in error to a Muslim household.  When called to complain. Transferred to customer service and was offered a replacement pizza \"as a courtesy\".  Had to wait another 40 min!  So finally the delivery kid gets back with the correct pizza and says his boss wants the original pizza back (because he assumes we are lying and said there's no way \"as a Muslim himself, he could make the mistake\").  I told the delivery guy that we threw out the pizza because the person in customer service manger said food cannot be returned as per their policy and told me to throw it out.    He said that's incorrect and his boss definitely wants it pizza back.  So we fetched it out of the garbage.  Rather than offering an apology, the owner was upset!  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Polite customer service, excellent bang for your buck, informative staff lets you know the best combination to minimize expense and focused flavours and crispy crust. This is perhaps the best Pizza Pizza experience."}
{"text":"While I notice some of the other negative reviews, we were pleased with our experience of this Pizza Pizza.  We were on vacation in Toronto, renting a condo in the building where this Pizza Pizza is located, so it made an easy dinner in, after spending the day site-seeing.   The food was good. The price was good. The service was fine.  We put in a movie, ate the pizza, and were happy."}
{"text":"I will never order from pizza pizza again. Pieces of pizza didn't even have meat I ordered on them. Pizza is gross!  I'll stick with Pizza Nova if I order from a chain."}
{"text":"Worst pizza pizza location in mississauga w/ regards to customer service. The delivery person sent from this location is consistently rude to the customers. Though I filed a complaint and got my full refund, i also suspect that this person tampers with the food in some way to non-tipping customers so i had pizza pizza take the delivered food back."}
{"text":"Just plain rude and incompetent employees. I don't expect much from Pizza Pizza. I just want to order a slice of whatever, pay and eat. Yet somehow this location always makes this simple process as difficult and unpleasant as possible."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner from here a few weeks ago and i was shocked at how bland a pizza could taste. We ordere pepperoni pizza, dipping sauce, chicken wings and drinks. My husband said the wings were average tasting but we could not get over how bad the pizza tasted. We chose to go with the cheaper pizza place and were highly disappointed. Next time i will def spend more $ to get dominoes pizza or pizza hut."}
{"text":"I ordered online which was easy...I had to wait 1h for my pizza to finally come by...I don't live far from the pizza pizza...I did order on January 1st so maybe shame on me?  If your offer service on odd days...just make sure you can if you can't they don't open! They also messed up my order by giving me a smaller can of soda...So two stars because the pizza was good and the online service was great."}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza pizza place. They are too cheap on the toppings. I barely have any cheese or toppings as I'm just eating tomatoes and bread. I don't even call this as a pizza place."}
{"text":"I find with Pizza Pizzas, it really depends on the location if it`s going to be good or not.  I can vouch that this is one of the best locations. The walk-in pizzas are alright, but you really want to get a freshly made to order pizza.  Try it with the homestyle italian sauce, extra sauce on the bottom. It`s really good. You`ll probably be surpised how good it is, coming from a Pizza Pizza. It`s better than other big chain pizza shops, and it`s way better than the Pizza Rustica across the street. You can order online, and the order is usually ready for pickup in about 15 minutes. Can`t get better service than that."}
{"text":"Pizza Pizza is hands down the worst pizza chain in all of the city. The quality of the ingredients is very bad and the taste of the pizza reminds you of why they are so cheap and affordable. Do yourself a favor spend a few bucks more and get a pizza that's actually worth eating. Like pizza Nova, which in my opinion is the best pizza chain or even pizzaville, at least they have a stone oven and their toppings and sauce is unique tasting."}
{"text":"Asked for cheese on top of toppings, they put the sauce ontop of everything Got a soggy pizza. Asked for sauce on wings and got no sauce on the wings."}
{"text":"Why does pizza pizza not cook your pizza properly unless you specify that you want it 'well done'?  This drives me mad.  Pizza Pizza is a place where you have to ASK to have the cheese on your pizza fully melted.  That's gross.  Still, like most Ontarians, I'm pretty attached to their crummy pies."}
{"text":"Horrible service. VERY SLOW!! I just put a small order in (pizza slice combo with fries). Sitting and waiting for 12 minutes wondering \"why is it taking so long?!\"  I decide to ask and they have not done anything to prepare my meal. I ordered a pepperoni slice and they then told me it would take 20 more minutes to make!! Are you kidding me?!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this joint for over 10 years. Not all pizza pizza locations are created equal, this one has by far better pizza than the other Markham locations (aka the one at Warden and 7).   Get the Mediterranean gourmet pizza, with extra thick crust and extra sauce so if you dont finish it, the pizza isn't too dry the next day. The pizza is amazing. Get it picked up, don't bother doing delivery.  They have other items, I tried the cinnamon sticks/funnel thingy since its free right now with their scratch card promotion but it tasted horrible. Stick to the pizza..."}
{"text":"Worst customer service.  I tried to redeem a free cheese/pepperoni slice with my raptors ticket since they scored over 100 points against Miami on Jan 22. They didn't have any ready and said it would be 20 minutes since they had not started making one yet. I did not have time to wait so I asked if I could pay the difference for a signature slice. The cashier asked the owner and he said it would be $2. The actual price difference displayed on the menu shows the difference is $1.25. Long story short, after arguing about the made up premium and the owner yelling at me in front of other customers, I will never go back to this location again."}
{"text":"Generic pizza place thats very cheap and very filling.  Its like pizza hut but in canada.  Wings were very good."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worse Pizza Pizza locations in Vaughan. They never have any toppings that are available online and don't bother to inform you when you pick up your pizza. Employees are generally pretty rude. Also weaseled their way out of the free pizza guarantee a few times when the pizza was late (I don't mind paying for the pizza, but the excuses they had were pretty dumb). Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"So, my husband brought home Pizza Pizza for dinner, and the moment he opened the boxes I could tell these pizzas were missing something. The cheese was about half of what it should have been. It didn't even cover the pizza. When my husband returned them citing that the advertised picture clearly indicated twice as much cheese, the manager told him that he must not understand advertising in Canada. The manager then proceeded to say that if he took a picture of my husband's face, it would not look the real thing. The pictures always look better than real life. I'm not sure why the manager thought that my husband's face was the best example of a thing that looks worse in real life, but needless to say we won't be back there again until my husband feels the need to have his face insulted again."}
{"text":"They have panzerottis also and a cute cashier. Take that as a free topping to your experience."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Would avoid the premade pizza. Must've been sitting out for a while though.  Onion rings were battered and cooked well, however, Very, VERY greasy.  Overall, might go again. Not the best food, but well worth the money. Keeping true to the \"you get what you pay for\" mantra."}

{"text":"I ordered a large pizza. The pizza itself was inedible due to the spice. I am no stranger to spice as I indulge in various culture's cuisine (i.e Indian, Mexican). The spice on the pizza was overwhelming that I honestly thought the employees made a mistake on order. Does Pizza Pizza taste their products because this was honestly a joke.   I am an avid pizza eater and gave Pizza Pizza a chance. This franchise is an insult to not only pizza but also costumer service. A complete disappointment. I will not be ordering from this franchise again."}
{"text":"This place is the closest pizza place to me, so of course I have tried to give it a go. Last I went here was a year ago... tried 3 times. Each experience worst than the next.   First time  - Pizza pizza has some thing there if they don't come out with a pizza within a certain time frame, your order is free. At least a year ago they had this. These guys took way too long on the first order I every had here, about 20 minutes too long, and so I asked for them to honor their corporate offer. They fought and fought, made me look like an idiot in front of the whole place, despite me showing them on my phone exactly the company's policy on their own site. After having to fight for them to honor their own policy, they tried to just take off one item. All this after making me look like some beggar for 5 minutes. I refused, went home and called corporate, and thankfully corporate helped me and had a talking to this place. Corporate followed up with me and thanked me for pointing this out to them, they got a brand to defend!  After that I let a few months go by, tried again. Pizza was awful. Almost like a dry cracker crust, didn't taste fresh, wasn't good.  Let a few more months go by, then try again. One last time! The place is so close, it's really hard to give up the location. So I did a take out order, got home and they gave me the wrong pizza! Eh it happens. So I call them up, and they want me to come in to get a new one. I just got home after work, swung by your place for pizza and you got it wrong (my fault for not checking it I guess, not the workers who get paid to be there), and you want me to go out again? Nah, I had to be stern with the worker on the phone and demand them deliver me a replacement order. They did... and guess what, that pizza was crap. You think they would make the most perfect pizza on earth to make you happy but no -  dried out crappy crust, wasn't stretched right, a few strands of cheese -  it was just thrown together in the worst way,,,,, and was cold somehow too!  After that I have never gone back. I write this after not going here for so long because I can't honestly think of another chain pizza place that has a franchise which is run so badly. Also, I can't think of a place I gave so many chances to and they just dropped the ball every time worst and worst."}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza, not made hot by their few seconds in the oven to reheat.  There is no customer service.  Everything is done for the convenience of staff, who don't seem to notice when a customer is standing at the counter hoping to order a slice.  Yes, drink your pop and hold your cigarette pack in your other hand while I wait patiently at the counter, than walk past me and head for the door.  I can wait.  They rarely have the small, inexpensive squares (veg or pepperoni) that is the only thing I like there.  Either can't be bothered to make them or maybe they want you to order something more expensive.  Which doesn't work - I walk out if there are no squares rather than order something I don't want.  It's in my neighbourhood, but I go there less and less.... there's not much there for me."}
{"text":"Will not order from this pizza pizza of any pizza pizza ever again. Quality has really gone down the drain over years. Just ordered a large whole wheat pizza with chicken pineapple olives and hot peppers and the whole wheat tasted spoiled like it's been sitting there for a long time same with the pineapple. Had two slices and it made me so sick to my stomach I had to throw out the entire box. Never again. So disappointed."}
{"text":"The worst resto experience I can think of!! My boyfriend called ahead of time to order wings. When I went to pick them up I was the only one at the counter with no one else at the resto. The two guys were just cracking jokes not paying attention. Eventually one looked my way and waved a box at me which were my wings. I opened the box in front of him and noticed just dry breaded wings in a box without parchment paper, when we ordered honey garlic. He went onto charge me for honey garlic dipping sauce. This is a franchise and there are rules to follow as a franchisor. It has always been that when you want dipping sauce for pizza OR when you want extra sauce you pay. You don't pay for dry wings and pay for sauce on the side especially when you ask for them tossed. The best part .... When I made a complaint to customer service, the location told them that I didn't pick up the wings and went on TO CRANK CALL me twice!! Get a life losers and learn to run an establishment!"}
{"text":"Everyone just likes pizza pizza for their dipping sauce, right? I feel like no one speaks about this. I mean, obviously you go to Libretto or Vesuvio's when you want to have a pizza day with other people and conversation and normalcy. But when you just want to have a pizza day by yourself with youtube and sweatpants, you always go to pizza pizza. I'm pretty sure it's the dipping sauce anchoring the decision for me, but it is a real testament to pizza pizza that they remain the golden go-to when I feel like gross eating. Pizza pizza is like the long island iced tea of the food world."}
{"text":"I love this place! They are always super quick even during very busy times (Friday nights even during high traffic times like Jays games since I live right by the Rogers Centre and this can be an issue). Their quality is consistent too. Once they forgot to add something in the bag and the driver even came back to return the item. I know most would've driven off since they are busy and don't care but this guy came back and we were so surprised and impressed!"}
{"text":"Pizza is always good and I love the wedges...but the staff at this particular Pizza Pizza make me avoid this place and go to 241 down the road instead. Very rude and arrogant. Never had a pleasant experience dealing with anyone at this location."}
{"text":"I am at school waiting for my pizza. It was supposed to be here 30 mins ago and I am furious. This is outrageous. How dare you let 500 starving girls wait for their lunch!! I am so upset. This isn't even the first time... SO MANY TIMES THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED. Please improve your delivery time. I am upset again. Please FIX THIS ISSUE ASAP. Update: it is now half an hour later. I have been waiting for one hour. People have to perform"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst location. And that's really saying something considering how crappy Pizza Pizza is even at its best. The pizzas always seem slapped together with all the toppings piled right in the middle and hardly any cheese. Better local options include: Il paesano, 850° and Pizzaiolo"}
{"text":"Worst pizza pizza. They never have any fresh slices, always mess up my order and their pizzas are always undercooked."}
{"text":"Fast food, like, eh. I was really hungry, so it tasted awesome, but would probably just be \"good\" for a regular person. The table was dirty though, so I decided to take out. $10 for an XL is pretty sweet though."}
{"text":"Friday Night and I wanted to give this place a shot. I ordered a medium pizza which was a walk in special for 5.99 plus tax.  Plenty of Cheese and pepperoni for the price. I would suggest to eat it right out of the oven.  Very good value for the price. Will be taking one to go for my fiance"}
{"text":"Very nice people! they are always friendly and ready to help if something is not ok. i ate a couple of times there and the pizza is really good! i recommend it to every one  if they want something with a good value!"}
{"text":"What the heck happened to Pizza Pizza? I have ordered from Mississauga for the last 12 years before coming to Etobicoke. My order came very quickly, in about 20 minutes but the pizza was not browned, some of the cheese 2as unmelted and my order of funnel sticks was overly burnt, with half the order that I usually get. I was shocked that there were so few funnel sticks in the box. I am sadly disappointed and am not ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I love me some Pizza Pizza. I mean, who doesn't really? No shame here guys.  However, I came in here the other day and ordered the poutine (it's still new in my food repertoire). I was really surprised to see the cashier - who handled the money, cash register, credit cards, phone, etc - prepare the poutine by using her bare hands to pile the cheese on top of the fries! No glove or anything. Is that normal people? I would have hoped that since the kitchen is in plain sight the staff would be more conscious of how they handle the food and their ingredients. Apparently not at this location.  I wish I could accurately describe my facial expression when I witnessed that happen. It was only $2 and I didn't want to kick up a fuss by confronting her so I took it and left (and the garbage was happily fed). I think something may need to be said to make sure that all the chains are following the same health code standards as the rest of them."}
{"text":"Pizza is good, had an All Dressed Pizza, had a good amount of toppings and thick crust. However!  There are seats, so I decided to \"take in\"...couldn't finish my large pizza so I asked for a box so I could take it home.  The person at the counter apologized and said the boss doesn't allow take out boxes for eat in.  I was SHOCKED, excuse me?  They also served the pizza on some flimsy 1 cent plate, good pizza terrible service from a cheap owner.  If you go there, say you are taking it out even if you are eating in. :)"}
{"text":"Here's the thing...  Our city has a plethora of amazing food, right at our fingertips.   Here's the other thing....  A lot of them close at reasonable times.   Pizza Pizza should never be eaten unless you have no other options. As a Pizza connoisseur (not self-proclaimed, my friends have deemed me so), there are 3 things that make a delicious pizza:  - Dough - Sauce  - Toppings  Pizza Pizza cannot deliver on any of the above.  Their dough is bland and tough, with a burnt crust about 90% of the time. The sauce is a combination of sour and/or salty, depending on the day.  Their toppings, although many available (thumbs up), are frequently contaminated.  What I mean by that is, I've never had a meal at Pizza Pizza that didn't taste like mushrooms. And I use the word \"meal\" loosely.   Again folks, i'm not trying to put them down. They do their job of being the McDonald's of pizza. And if you're in to that kind of thing, i'll roll out the neon orange carpet.    But for the rest of us, do yourself a favour and step up your 'Za game."}
{"text":"The staff are very friendly but the quality is mediocre at best. They put so little cheese on their pizza and it's mostly dough. Unless it's your last option late at night... this is a skip."}
{"text":"Don't come in and expect anything fancy. Good pizza, not undercooked even though it looks that way. The shape makes it look fictional, which usually isn't a good thing but in this case it was actually decent.  It's one of those pizza shops that you just walk into, order pizza and sit down and eat it. People don't give it good reviews because they think that it's not good because it's not fancy.  You ever just wanna get something to eat, it's a short distance from the Eaton Chelsea, might as well walk."}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Pizza place I ever visited. Cashier was rude and ignorant. I just wanted to buy a slice of cold pizza and she refused to sell it to me.... Even when I told her that this not the only Pizza place in a neighborhood, she just told that I can go anywhere, but she won't sell me anything here. For years I was buying cold pizza without any problems, but not here.  This is a very disappointing location. I would never return here."}
{"text":"I think management must have changed. There were friendly, eager staff there tonight. One immediately greeted me while two were cleaning the kitchen. It's still only fair pizza. Exactly what you'd expect from a Pizza Pizza."}
{"text":"The food is alright here but when ordering delivery... Don't forget to tip GENEROUSLY or they ring your doorbell again for more! I was so shocked!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service. The counter person was rude and annoying. The pizza taste ok, nothing special. You get what you paid for."}
{"text":"This location is the worst one off all I have been to in my life. The quality of the food and service is just too bad. It runs on drunk weekend party goers who can put anything in their mouth late at night. Pizza pizza should look into this place."}
{"text":"What I ate of the pizza slice I tasted was ok. My reading is based on the cleanliness or lack thereof. I was there for about an hour and never saw the guy handling the pizzas wash his hands even though he was touching his phone and lots of other things in the store. The delivery driver went into the bathroom and did not wash his hands. He was also handling pizzas. I couldn't finish my meal."}
{"text":"Ils n'arrivent jamais à l'heure qu'ils promettent, les livreurs ne parlent pas français et ils oublient les assiettes malgré l'insistance dans la commande."}
{"text":"Was a long time customer, I was entertaining company and ordered for delivery. Driver came and tried to call me instead of buzzing in the lobby, when i didn't answer my cell phone he left. I called back after the 40 Min and they apologized and sent him back out.. they told me I still had to pay because I didn't answer my phone. Frustrated but hungry I agreed. The driver took over 1 hour to return with a cold pizza, i told him I'm not paying for that and called the hotline. . After an argument with the lady because I agreed to pay to re-send it and now waiting over 2 hours i had them take it back ....  I then called Pizza Nova at 416-439-0000 and received my pizza in 20 minutes with no hassle..."}
{"text":"Terrible takeout. Infested with little black flies. Would never get a slice to go there again. I went back in one night just for beverage and thought I would get a bag of their to-go brownies and they when I got home the bag said it expired 2 months ago."}
{"text":"A lot of people dumping on this Pizza Pizza location.  It's very typical Pizza Pizza, nothing outrageously bad, just the usual cheap, half-decent pie you've come to expect.  The sweet thai chili chicken and philly cheese steak are always winners at 2am.   As well, try a Hawaiian pizza (pineapple, ham and crumbled bacon) on multi-grain crust using the bruschetta topping instead of sauce - it really bumps the pizza up a class.   I've noticed that this place is also pretty fast for having your pick-up order prepared.  Sure, it's not Libretto but you have your food in hand in around half the time that you would have to wait in line just to get a seat at Libretto."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Probably because it's closest to me. The pizza is not awful but lacking in flavour. The dough is thick and bready. If you like that kind of thing great. Service is fine. Doesn't stand out as good or bad.   The dips are extremely thick and seem highly synthetic. I have tried a calzone here. Absolutely huge for about 7 dollars. The fried pickles were very tasty. Would recommend those! Otherwise it's all just.... Fine."}
{"text":"We've ordered from this location several times but tonight will probably be the last. We ordered dinner via the pizza pizza app, everyone knows their promise 40 min or it's free. They even have a timer that counts down on the app so you know how long it's taken. We waited and waited...the app timer flashed 0:00, yay free pizza!! No . The driver called a minute after the timer went off, what door am I going to? My boyfriend states side door as per the instructions. He shows up, my boyfriend jokes, free pizza hooray, as he hands over his credit card (being a nice guy and it being one minute over was going to pay for the pizzas). The driver proceeds to have a hissy fit in he driveway, states he was not late, he called five minutes ago - which was not true he called about 10 seconds prior. The rest was just the driver shouting at my boyfriend at the door. We stated we didn't want the pizza and shut the door, not before asking his name which he wouldn't give. We called the only number they allow 967-1111, they state they will send out the pizzas again right away for free....from the same location...by the same driver...another 40 minute wait. Wait didn't that just happen????? They didn't solve any problem, we had to wait total 80 minutes for pizza...that would have been free the first time around. When the next delivery drive showed up, he had the audacity to say oh if it's free can I have a tip!! For your poor service and verbal abuse? Why of course."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I loved Pizza Pizza so much when I was a kid... maybe just because they don't have it at home. Either way, I was craving some pizza today so I went in here. Not overly impressed. I mean, the pizza's not bad or anything, it's just not very good. I won't be back.  The girl at the counter was also a bit brusque..."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have only ordered the pepperoni pizza.  This place is pretty small (3 tables and an indoor bench) but I usually order to go and do some grocery shopping while I wait for them to prepare my pizza anyways.   On my last visit I got an xl pepperoni pizza for $9.99 (their current promotion, walk in only). My shopping trip lasted about 40 minutes but I knew the pizza was done before that.   When I came in for the pick up, the pizza was still hot because they set it on top of the oven which was nice of them but I mean don't abandon your pizza for 2 hours.  Overall, I would come back. The dough was crisp and chewy, sauce had a nice aroma and was generously topped."}
{"text":"Got the walk in medium pepperoni pizza, excellent crust! Quickly made although it was definitely not busy at the time"}
{"text":"If Pizza Pizza had a Most Valuable Customer, I would be in for the running ... :)  I order frequently from Pizza Pizza, at least 2-3 times per week - not just because I love Pizza, but most of the time it's for staff at work (quick and easy).   This particular Pizza Pizza is my favourite, there's something about the way they make their Pizza that makes it taste fresh and delicious every time.   My favourite is pepperoni, mushroom and bacon strips. Yumm-eee!   Also to note, there have been a few times where I've had to contact customer service (not always due to this location), and I've found that they are quick to address my issue and to accommodate my request - even going further to offer me a comp for my next order.   Cheers!  - T"}
{"text":"For a cheap meal, Pizza Pizza in the area is hard to beat.   It's been here at the Coulter Mills plaza for long time (10+ years). I think for a short time before this, this used to be Little Caesar's Pizza.   I've been getting the $4.99/5.99 medium pizza pick-up specials as of late. At this price I'd always buy fresh than grocery store frozen.   The staff here are friendly and accommodating. Sometimes I run errands around the area and at a later time pick up the pizza. It's hot when I arrive.  They take special request too just specify before ordering. I've asked for lightly done crust,  cheese over top the toppings instead. No problems.   The preparation of the pizza at this franchise location is made with a bit more care I find and when picking up they voluntarily pop open the pizza box for your inspection. It's not a masterpiece but it's affordable and decent."}
{"text":"I like pizza pizza. I really do.  But this specific location is horrible. I feel as though they have figured out that they can get by with serving an inferior product because they will get customers because of their location.  Staff is rude. Location is dirty and pizza is horrible. If you are desperate enough to need a pizza in this area, go to Pizza Nova or Pizzaville down the street. East of this location. Your money will be better served."}
{"text":"waited 10 min in line and walked out. 3 people working and no one working the counter.  they would rather talk about what ever they where doing. I guess customers aren't important I was the second customer to walk away for taking to long."}
{"text":"The McDonald's of pizza.   A place where hours old slices die a slow, painful death on unheated glass shelves.   A place where food safety is thrown out the window as meat pizza slices sit out un-refridgerated for most of the day.   I gave up on it years ago due to a string of undercooked, mostly dough pizzas at insanely high prices.   The pasta is downright scary. Its frozen, thawed and then microwaved and served in a plastic dish. Tiny portion, no flavour, $7.   The arugula salad is a cruel joke. Its basically all iceberg lettuce with a tiny bit of arugula laid over top giving you the illusion when in the container that you actually got more than 2 bites of arugula for $7.   The only reason why I gave it 2 stars and not 1 is the Sausage Mushroom Melt with thin crust. Seriously you have to try that one. Its greasy goodness that is so good I can't believe it came from Pizza Pizza."}
{"text":"Did not honor pizza pizza promotion of free slice of pizza when raptors win and score over 100 points"}
{"text":"So this is the closest pizza pizza to my place and the best part is it's open till 2 am on weekdays. However there is a pissed off old guy who works here and just talks rude to everybody and sometimes even refuses options on the menu. When he asks for what  a customer wants, he sounds really angry and could work on his hospitality skills. That being said I don't completely blame him. He works hard in the kitchen and i have seen him work alone by himself a lot of times. I feel that if this pizza pizza had more staff around, he might be a happy old guy. Anyways, no major complaints with food and hence 3 stars."}
{"text":"We always order from this pizza pizza and have not been dissatisfied. Pizza is always hot and fresh, and we always receive the correct order in a timely manner. Great customer service as well."}
{"text":"I will NEVER order from this location again. I got the worst food poisoning of my life!!! I ordered a pizza with chicken, mushrooms and pineapple and for the next four days I was constantly throwing up. I have never been this sick in my life. Never again."}
{"text":"Worst experience. Please do not visit the location at Jane and Finch. Also, when are you ordering online or by phone please ensure that you do not get service from the Jane and Finch location.   Here is what happened:  I ordered for delivery. The ordered arrived on time - no problem there. The pizza was smashed - as if someone punched it really. I did not pay for the order and had a chat with the Pizza Pizza representative - he assured me that they ll redo the whole order i.e. make a fresh pizza and send it back for free. Few minutes later, the driver showed up at my door and handed me the same order except this time the toppings were rearranged as if the driver rearrange the toppings himself with his dirty hands. I spoke with the same customer service representative once again, he was really embarrassed as he put a special note on the order, and none of the workers took that note into an account. As a result, I got a credit for $27 bucks.  Nevertheless, I am very dissatisfied with the service of the Jane and Finch location and extremely disappointed. This event happened today between 2 pm - 4 pm on Jan 3rd 2015 on Saturday.  The phone number of the driver is: 416-826-7164 ( I asked him to provide me with the store's phone number so that I can speak to the manager directly and he refused. I believe the manager's name is Dufaat or Afaat or something along those lines. Their team at Jane and Finch ruined my Saturday evening.  Should you have any questions or concerns then please contact me at: mazin@hotmail.ca  I would like to see what Pizza Pizza could do more to restore my confidence in the food handling service they provide in the upcoming days. If they cant do anything or take any action regarding this matter I will make that $27 credit available to the general public as I have no interest in ordering pizza from these guys again."}
{"text":"I live in Little Italy and I admit I was ashamed that I ventured into this Pizza Pizza location, but I was hungry and wanted something quick, so that was my reason.  Plus the price of a medium pepperoni pizza for $4.99,  very inexpensive, therefore, I cannot complain because after all it's a franchise and pizzas are fairly consistent each time.  It was my first time stepping into this location on a Monday evening after a gym workout and what a sad state the store was.  Napkins were on the floor and pizza boxes lingered on top of the garbage containers with the condiments askewed. No other customers were in the store and only one customer that entered while I was there waiting for my pizza.  It was actually quite depressing and why was I there again when I had an abundance of other places in the neighbourhood to choose from.  There was only one staff member working and wasn't at all welcoming or friendly upon my entry or when I ordered my pizza.  Staff member just looked miserable and didn't even bother to wait until I finished my debit transaction before heading to the back to make the pizza, but did informed me before I paid about the estimated wait time.  While I sat there waiting for my pizza to be made, I kept thinking I should have just gone to a nearby restaurant or walked the extra couple of blocks to Bitondo or San Francesco.  I couldn't believe I chose Pizza Pizza over all the vast selection of real Italian cuisine in Little Italy.  For the convenience and the low price, they do make a decent pizza, but the fact that I was in Little Italy, I should have gone elsewhere. Lesson learned, but should I be in the tired and hungry situation again, I may return because after all the pizzas are doughy, sauce and pepperoni salty, plenty of cheese which as a runner I sometimes crave and do need to help me fuel.  Probably not a good choice, but it works for me most of the time.  Pizza Pizza you're A-OK!"}
{"text":"Located right at the  corner of Queen and Bathurst it can be quite the interesting  place since the various characters who surrounds the area can definitely  cause  quite the scene at times.  The service  is usually friendly, but can be a hit or miss at this location  depending  on the time of visit, so be prepared to not see a smile, but just fast and efficient service.  Pizzas are quite consistent, being a franchise, I should hope that the food quality is the same each and every time.  I usually come here to pick up their medium pepperoni pizza to go because for $4.99, I cannot complain."}
{"text":"The worst pizza pizza location thus far!!!! I placed an order yesterday and of course my pizza was BURNT again. I called customer service to complain and they apologized and said they will be replacing my order. Long story short, the store refused to replace my order and only wanted to give me a store credit. So now I'm stuck with burnt pizza and my $ is gone. I wasn't satisfied so I called customer service again and they had to call the district manager because the store manager was refusing to cooperate. 10 min later I get a call from the pizza pizza driver telling me that he is in my lobby with my refund. He provided the refund and told me that his boss said they will no longer be delivering to me again. So let me get this straight, they made a mistake, refused to replace my order and now they want to band me from delivery because I wanted a refund. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS LOCATION!!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY. I have pictures below of the \"lightly done\" pizza they sent to me. This is not the first time this has happened either!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza chain.  Prices are dirt cheap,  service is friendly and food is great.  One of the best New-York style pepperoni pizza I had in years (grab a couple dips with your pizza for a little kick!). I highly recommend them.

The guy who took my phone order was awesome believe it or not.  However, I was extremely disappointed when picking up my pizzas.  ALWAYS CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE LEAVING THE STORE!  I ordered 2 XL pizzas and wedges.  One of my pizzas had the wrong toppings on it!  So they made a new pizza with my original toppings requested but I had to wait 10 mins when I should have been out the door and my 2nd pizza was not as hot due to the extra wait!  Once we got home, we noticed some slices have black stuff on it (burnt/dirty oven!?!) and the crust wasn't made properly.  I definitely don't recommend this place!"}

There were no spots available anywhere within that area. I thought ok, we won't be long.   Upon my return I realized my car has been hit and damaged by a vehicle that failed to remain on the scene. A very helpful witness had informed us that he had left his number along with plate # of the car with the people at the pizza pizza.

First, I wanted to save a few dollars so I told the girl I wanted to use my Club 11 11 points, she told me I had to pay first, no points were used, so I saved nothing.

I doubt I'll be returning to this location, there are other places in the area to get pizza."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 3 times now and have never had a good experience! I walked in on Thursday night to grab a slice, I saw 2 employees in the back.  They both look up and see me, one goes back to making a pizza and the other one turns and walks around the corner in the back room. I stand there for maybe a minute and neither of the employees come out to the front to help me. I then decided that they didn't deserve my money so I left.  If i could give it 0 stars I would! I will never step foot in thus location again!"}
{"text":"I came to the Mountainash location for potato wedges and asked the cashier to call us a taxi. Then another person came and said okay but then another man came and he was disrespectful to my husband and I. He pointed with his finger to the Esso gas station up the street and said go there to get your cab and my husband replied \"do you not have a work phone?\" Again, he pointed his hand and finger towards the gas station, saying \"they'll get you a cab.\" In which, my husband said \"that is rude and disrespectful, I am a paying customer.\" The worker then, rolled his eyes and walked away. Moving forward, the cashier approached us again with the cordless work phone. At this point, we had used our app to call a cab. My husband and I reiterated that is was very rude, due to that we were paying customers and would like to speak to the manager and were told there was no manager on duty. My husband apologized to the cashier and it wasn't her fault but the man was extremely unprofessional and had horrible customer service. We got our wedges and left the store."}

I've never had Pizza Pizza before being from the West coast.  I think they have them in Cineplex theatres, but no where else AFAIK.   They have slices available, but some looked like they had been out for a while so we went with their $14.99 deal ($2 more for XL). Any size pizza with 3 toppings, 3 cans of pop and 1 dipping sauce. It was pretty solid for 2 people and the pizza was fine. Might not be the best pizza, but I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This franchise has the worst customer service I've ever dealt with in any business. They delivered my pizza to my billing address instead of my delivery address, then tried to blame me when it was their screw up. After this happened, every single person who worked there -- from driver to customer service person to manager -- was shockingly rude and refused to do anything for us. We were kind and polite and we were treated shockingly.    This is not how you run a business."}
{"text":"Recomendable!   Fuimos para comer un poco de pizza y esperando no gastar mucho y así fue.  La pizza tenia una masa crujiente de la que no dejamos ni los bordes. Buena cantidad de ingredientes sin ser excesivos, pero lo mas destacable tanto por cantidad como por calidad es su salsa de tomate!  Buen precio tanto para las porciones y sobretodo en los combos. Por lo que pude ver, las ofertas para grupos también salían muy rentables.  El espacio no es muy amplio, pero suficiente para comer unas porciones.  El servicio fue mas que correcto y facilitador a la hora de escoger."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the negative aspects associated with franchises hold true to this location. The food is bland, unimaginative, and stock. I don't know what I was expecting, but apparently they now offer chilli........"}
{"text":"Most of my orders at this place consist of walk in specials. I rarely ever stay and sit down for a meal. The place could def be wayyyyy cleaner.   The staff is friendly but the owner has some real attitude problems. Ive walked in many times and heard her yelling/berating customers and employees alike. She took my order once and I asked for my pizza to get well done and she gave me attitude and raised her voice at me for literally no reason whatsoever. Sheesh...  Will visit again but only when shes not taking custom made orders at the front."}
{"text":"Always get my pizza here, the person making the pizza is always a great time to talk to. He knows how to make pizza.   You have to order the pizza the way you like it at pizza pizza, thin crust, well done, with seasonings is essential for me. Unfortunately they give out free pizza's if it's not made on time unlike any of the other chains that stopped doing it, so they rush.   Toppings are plentiful and it's always piping hot out the oven.  They stuff the box of fries and onion rings until it's completely full, and they're not too oily. always am happy with them."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Montreal Marriott Chateau Champlain recently and we wanted some late-night pizza (10pm). Pizza Pizza was nearby and delivered to the hotel so we ordered two pizzas and while ordering it was suggested by the person taking our order that we try the warm brownie which we said yes to. The pizza came in about thirty minutes which was good but the first red flag was when we paid the delivery driver and he was walking out of the hotel when we noticed that there was no brownie. We stopped him and asked him where it was and he said \"oh we were sold out of it\" at which point I asked why he haven't told us and had taken our money for it. He then asked if we wanted our money back! Uh yes please! He gave us the money back, minus the tax paid which at that point I decided not to argue about and we took the pizza up to the room. Ugh both pizzas were absolutely the WORST pizza I have ever had. There were hardly any toppings, the chicken on one was dry and \"crumbly\" and the cheese was next to non existent. The toppings that were on the pizzas ended about an inch from the crust and it was just dry bread from there on to the crust. I phoned the restaurant back and as soon as I started to advise my complaint the person on the other end suddenly didn't speak English! What a rip off! Do yourself a favour and NEVER order from here, you will thank me!"}
{"text":"The lady wouldn't let me or anyone else use the washroom even after we ordered pizzas, saying it was broken. While eating my pizza I seen staff go in and out of the washrooms. I asked again and she replied \"It's only for changing da clothes\". I made a complaint to Pizza Pizza head office weeks ago, no response.  No Pizza Money For You"}
{"text":"This location never has potato wedges, and they get defensive when you ask why... go to the Vic Park and Finch location instead."}
{"text":"Pizza Pizza. My enemy and my friend. You make me fat, always, but you come whenever I call, even 2 am, I love you for it.   What is there to say about pizza pizza that everyone doesn't already know. They make pretty good pizza. It isn't gourmet, but it's alright. Loads of topping options. Usually well cooked too. Quality is pretty consistent.   It's good for some late night greasy food. It's the popular choice to call for when friends are staying the night. Everyone likes pizza, it's just an easy choice.   Call pizza pizza if you want some delivery, or have a group of friends over and you're all hungry, and don't want to spend much cash."}
{"text":"So an update after my little ordeal with Pizza Pizza...  So they message and call me offering me first a gift card to 'compensate for the amount i paid and then some more'. I find out it's a $25 gift card. I told them i had no problem with their offer but would still like an apology from the CEO of Pizza Pizza. They ignore my comment and have someone call me to get my address.  Then a few days later someone calls me and offers me a $50 gift card and ask for my address. Still no comment or update regarding my request for an apology from the CEO of Pizza Pizza.  I then get another call from the district sales manager stating he will send me Toronto Raptors tickets. He gets my address with no apology or update regarding my request for an apology from the CEO of Pizza Pizza.  I receive the $50 gift card in the mail with a letter... and of course the letter says nothing in the lines of an apology. The letter says:  \"RE: Your Service Experience  Further to our discussion, thank you for contacting Pizza Pizza. We at Pizza Pizza pride ourselves on quality products and services, and we thank you for taking the time to contact us.  You are a valued customer and we sincerely appreciate your feedback. Thank you again for making time to contact us and please find enclosed the voucher we discussed.  Yours truly,  Pizza Pizza Limited Customer Service\"  So fine, i receive this letter. I wait for the Toronto Raptors tickets to arrive thinking that maybe there's a letter with an apology. A few days later I get the tickets in a white envelope with NO letter or any acknowledgement of the situation. Side note: I received 3 tickets to a Sacramento Kings game seated up in the furthest part of the Air Canada Centre. Another side note: who wants to be my third wheel?  So tell me what is wrong with this picture? 1) I get offered barely an amount that was worth my time and effort for this complaint - $25. Instead they up it to $50 thinking that i'm still going to come to Pizza Pizza. 2) I receive a generic letter with no apology and not personalized by any specific person at Pizza Pizza. Just 'Customer Service'. 3) They offer me Toronto Raptors tickets to a game that no one goes to and with tickets that no one wants to sit in.  4) Last and most importantly, after all the chances they had they had not acknowledged anything about my request for an apology from the CEO of Pizza Pizza Paul Goddard.  So with all this being said, i'm soooo not done. I want Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, Toronto Raptors, Air Canada Centre and everyone else involved with this brand to know who they have partnered with and how they are treating their customers and fans.  Further updates to come."}
{"text":"Worst pizza pizza in the city.  Staff has tried to short change me more than once. Slices are always stale and service is extremely slow.  A fan of pizza pizza for years, but this specific location ruined it for me and my family."}
{"text":"A lot of bad reviews coming from this Pizza Pizza, location and I'm gonna go out on a limb and say I disagree.   I've been enjoying this Pizza Pizza for the past 3 years or so whenever I'm in Canada. It's a friendly atmosphere, the staff is polite and nice and the pizza is delicious. Although their delivery service may be a bit rough their walk in service is just what I need.    Pizza Pizza is delicious for when you're in a hurry or if you're not wanting to cook. How can anyone go wrong with pizza? :)"}
{"text":"This has been by far the absolute worst experience I've had with any Pizza Pizza location. I ordered the half moon cheesy italian bread with marinara dip (the dip is not separate it's included). The service was very bad and took 20-30 minutes just for my order, and there was not many people either. When I received my order the marinara sauce was missing, and so was my friend's order. I went up to the worker (who was very young and unprofessional and quiet), and said that the sauce was missing in both of our orders. He then very hesitantly checked the name of the order and then asked me for my receipt. How can you not remember me ordering this when I literally have the food in my hands and I did not even order that long ago? My friend and I were the only customers that ordered at the time. After checking both our receipts he yet again hesitantly gave us our marinara sauce. I should not even have had to show my receipt because I already received my order and the order is half moon cheesy italian bread WITH MARINARA DIP, it should be included either way. I will never come back to this location again, I will just stick to Pizza Hut or Domino's Pizza."}
{"text":"We order from here all the time. Pizza is never late and the drivers are a bunch of nice guys. Never had a problem with any deliveries."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for mere one slice of pizza :) Terrific staff, TERRIFIC. A wonderful place if you want to take a nap before you have your dinner:))"}
{"text":"Most fucked up service ever, I mean I set there for 15 minutes for pizza and in the end it's not what I fucking ordered. The cashiers over there  need to get there shit together."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. I ordered my pizza at 11:50pm after checking they it would be open till 2am, and received a confirmation email saying it would be ready in 15. As I got there, it was closed. Granted it was a day after a holiday, but they couldn't have the decency to just call and be like \"Hey sorry for the error, but online it says 2am but we close at 12am today.\" All would be good, but the fact I get there and they refuse to open the door for me to even talk to them. Terrible. I try calling customer service, and no one can pick up the call for 30 minutes. What if I had paid online? Would I just lose my money? I'm never eating this trash again. And no one else should, go somewhere else worth it like pizza nova, or mama's pizza which are located close by."}
{"text":"It is an ok pizza. Maybe i would've liked it better if it was warmer after the delivery on my last experience. When i went to order and eat at the Pizza Pizza on St-Laurent Street it was also just ok. So I give it a two star. In the future I will chose other restaurants for my pizza. But as a last resort it can fill up your stomach."}
{"text":"Exactly how you'd expect the average Pizza Pizza location to be like, in terms of quality and customer service.  Seeing as it's just down the road from several schools, the place is a haven for groups of teens who just want to loiter and hangout. Service (and any form of conversation) with the servers is practically non-existent, as they all seem to be too busy focusing on deliveries to even say ten words to you. The pizza is the usual affair - sometimes doughy, only great when it's fresh.  It's cheap, decent quality for the price, but if you're expecting better pizza, you'd do well to walk down the street to Pizzaiolo and spend a couple bucks more for gourmet ingredients."}
{"text":"One of my worst customer service experinces ever. Zero stars.  My husband and I walk in, order (one 10\" pizza, one meatball marinara Italian sandwich, one large garden salad, two fountain drinks), are given drink cups, and are told everything will be ready in 15 minutes.  10 minutes later, my pizza and the salad are ready, but I was told the meatball sandwich would be ready in 5 to 10 minutes! What?!  So I say, \"We both came together and ordered together. We expect to eat together. So please keep my pizza warm and the salad cold until the meatball sandwich is ready.\"  With great reluctance and a roll of her eyes, she did... and, after juat a couple of minutes, the meatball sandwich was ready. When my husband opened the sandwich, it was bread with meatballs... NO marinara sauce. So, he went to the counter to ask about aauce, and was told the sandwich doesn't come with sauce. WHAT?!  Seriously crappy customer service. Zero stars."}
{"text":"usually order from here, but last week had food poisoning, and their pizza was the only food i ate that night, next day ate the left over pizza and had more washroom breaks, confirmed that whoever makes their pizza has sime very dirty hands. absolutely refuse ti order from them again"}
{"text":"Came here a few times because I was craving something salty and wanted a quick, cheap eat. Overall, fairly average at best. Service was fast, friendly, and professional though! Kinda felt sorry for the one woman running the show during their busy lunchtime.  Pros: - Typial selection of: hawaiian, canadian, vegetarian, cheese only, etc. - Fantastic location, right outside Broadview Subway Station - Lots of seating, open space - Big screen TV - Practically zero wait time - Large, open windows with natural light (for people watching) - Good for lunch, late-night eats  Cons: - No parking - Only one washroom, which was out-of-order every time I went in - Large, open windows with natural light (so people can watch you) - Dated decor"}
{"text":"I used to get pizza delivery from this location and it was an older man, very friendly. Then The next few times I ordered it was a younger indian guy who was extremely rude and creepy. He would comment on the last name of my girlfriend in a creepy manner and he would try and flirt and move toward us too close for comfort until the point when I had to tell him it was creepy and to step back. I will not order pizza from here again. Terrible."}
{"text":"This is my default Pizza joint.  They do a good job and don't skimp on the toppings."}
{"text":"This pizza pizza is better then the others. For one the whole pizza doesn't fall off if you bite into it. They overload it with toppings and the staff get to know you and your order if your a regular."}
{"text":"Had pizza here last night .. Not the  best Pizza Pizza place... I prefer the one at Broadview and Danforth.. they put less pizza sauce..  but the customer service here is good.. The Guy working last night was super friendly.."}
{"text":"Last time I ordered Hawaii pizza from there and I was in a rush and pick the wrong order from the counter because the package all have the same looking and there's no label on it. It's easy for people to pick the wrong thing."}
{"text":"I love pizza pizza but I ordered 2 large pizzas, two dipping sauces and some drinks. The driver took 30 minutes to find my house I didn't have much of a problem with that because it's a hard house to find. I pay him and he took 5 dollars without me even saying he could. I took my pizza, it was cold and the dipping sauces weren't in the bag with the drinks so I called back, they said the driver would come with 2 new pizzas and my sauces. It took him 40 minutes to bring my pizzas and dips, I know he could have been on another run but it was a Tuesday afternoon, anyways he very rude about it and he almost came into my house to check I wasn't hiding the dipping sauces."}
{"text":"Pizza Pizza is a franchise and this is a typical location.  Food is prepared to pizza pizza standards and so is the level of service.  Doesn't mean it's amazing food, but it is predictable and dependable.  So not exactly a glowing review, but I've never had anything turn out bad here."}
{"text":"Extremely horrible. We regularly order online from Pizza Pizza. But whenever we have selected this outlet, the pizza has been extremely spicy.  We hail from India; very well know what 'spicy' means. But even for us, the honey garlic sriracha they prepared was extremely spicy. To the extent we had to Just dispose off the pizza in the compost bin. Very very horrible."}
{"text":"There's not much that could be said about the food as this is a standardized franchise. But what I wanted to talk about is the service.   They were a pair of older men, rude, gruff, and short with words. They didn't even ask the standard \"How may I help you?\", or \"please give me a second\", rather the first guy I had eye contact with just ignored me, and they chit chatted for a handful of seconds as they loaded some pizza boxes, then the other guy stepped forward to the counter and just spat out a rude \"Yes?\" with his nose turned up at me.   Seriously?  If I hadn't already paid for my pick-up order online I would have just walked out right the door. No thanks Grumpy pants!  I'm never ordering pick-up to that location ever again. If they are this way with customers, just imagine how they treat their product and ingredients.   Okay, actually I will talk about the food.  Our pizzas were hot, but dry, very dry. Possibly overcooked. The new chorizo and potato specialty pizza was terrible due to dry, possibly stale, potato slices. It's like eating dry McDonalds fries after they've been sitting out for an hour. Usually Pizza Pizza meets my expectations because they are standardized all across the map, but this place stood out as sub-par and is a disservice to the franchise.   Not to mention all the shop signs and parking lot lamps were off! Very difficult to navigate through that lot in the dark and find the place without illuminated shop signs. This is the plaza with the Nations supermarket. Sub Par!"}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza pizza in the GTA. They either forget your toppings don't have the ones you want. Stay away. The way they cut the pizza and put their toppings on are not porportionate. I sometimes forget that this is the closest location to my house that delivers to me and order by mistake. Half of the pizza will be thin crust and the other half would be thick as hell. Who does that?  This is a disgrace to the chain!"}
{"text":"Thankful they opened up a Pizza Pizza here and they're opened late for those late night craving after drinking. They're quick, efficient and super nice. No complaints!"}
{"text":"WARNING!! I should have read the reviews before ordering from here. Made few orders over the phone during the weekends. They seem to just reheat precooked pizza instead of making it fresh. It tasted like a cardboard. It was definitely not fresh. If I were you, I would definitely opt for a different place or other family owned pizza stores around the area."}
{"text":"Even though its part of a chain, you have to try their specialty pizzas for $5-6. We had the Spicy Thai, which was great. There is also Bruschetta, Asparagus and 5 other interesting personal size pizzas."}
{"text":"Went to order for in store pickup. Went to the store to pick it up and no one was in front of the store. Had to stand there for 5 minutes and had to call pizza pizza for them to actually come to the front of the store. Very unprofessional and terrible service"}
{"text":"I'm amazed at how dirty this place is. You would think that the pIzza pizza brand would try to avoid these situations. Newspapers everywhere. Chicken on the ground and the employee texting away.  Maybe someone with authority reading this will do something about this?"}
{"text":"Very friendly cashier!  Was actually a pleasure to talk to her. This is a big enough store that you can sit comfortably.  Also a very convenient location along Sheppard and close to Yonge Street. Big parking lot and right next to a Beer Store...yes!  Eating pizza fresh out of the oven is always best.  I love pizza pizza.  The only negative is that the tables are always a little dirty every time we come here."}
{"text":"This place seems to have really shaped up in the last year. A complete overhaul of the interior, friendly staff and what I can only assume is new management. Kudos B-line Pizza Pizza!"}
{"text":"Got us 10 pizzas prepared quickly with no notice.  Store was clean.  Service was good.  Helped out tremendously when we had a crew to feed."}
{"text":"This place has the highest level of customer service in a pizza place I've ever been. Food was good and the workers there are really nice"}
{"text":"Great pizza pizza from across Honest Ed's. Price all the same, but the pizza is super fresh every time.   Great customer service, some of the cashiers have an accent tho."}
{"text":"This might be one of the bad place to go. It about their commutation their not good good at. One day I went to pizza pizzas with a coupons the worker was all fishy and started to ask me odd questions. When it's none of your business. And the other day I went I had the pizza box rip coupons and the worker made me pay it because I had to order it online which is probably the stupidest thing to do. Trust you do not want to go to this place and yes the workers are all filthy with flys."}
{"text":"One of the cleaner, faster and friendlier Pizza Pizzas I have visited. The quality of the pizza here is good and always consistent. That's all I ask for from a Pizza Pizza!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Pizza joint in city center Toronto on Young St, down by Eaton Center, and across the street from Ryerson University. The freshly made pizzas are alright (if you don't mind waiting 30 minutes, yes 30), but the pre-made single slices and Panzarotti leave something to be desired; dry and overpriced.  Generally speaking I'm not a big fan of this canadien Pizza chain, as their prices are expensive and their menu is too varied, just focus on Pizza. But if you don't mind paying a little extra and are not in a rush, pay the $18, wait the 30 minutes, and enjoy a hot 3 topping large."}
{"text":"Does not keep up with Pizza Pizza company policy. I ordered pizza from these guys. When I went to pick it up, I got told that 2 of my toppings were out of stock and there were not able to make my pizza. They never bothered to call me when they realized that they couldn't make my pizza. I asked them to honour Pizza Pizza's 15 min or free policy, but they lied to me saying that they called my number but I didn't pick up my phone."}
{"text":"Stay away from this Pizza Pizza. They do not clean up the trash that results from people eating their stuff on their sidewalk tables. It swirls all over the street and makes the neighborhood look terrible. When told about it, they consider the complaint a nuisance and ignore it."}
{"text":"Stay Away! You will be tempted if you just exit your long flight and feel hungry.  Please walk past this place, you will thank me for the recommendation.  Pizza is precooked and reheated.  Zero taste, lots of bread.  This is the worst pizza ever.  Plus, the price is absurd.  I'm going to respond to the \"customer survey\" printed on the receipt and ask for a refund, but I'm not holding my breath.  Staff spoke very little English, very sad."}
{"text":"We were here for a late-night bite, and this place was packed! As late and busy as it was, the selections were still plentiful and the service was still pretty quick! The pizza was pretty good too! I got meat lover's and pepperoni, and both were delicious. The crust was rather thin but still delicious."}
{"text":"The McDonalds of pizza. Skip it and walk half a block to the Big Slice."}
{"text":"Not great, not bad, but it is there. When you feel like pizza and nothing else is open, etc -  this is the place. It is an ideal place to order a pizza from if you have friends over to watch a sporting event, etc. If you are in a rush and want a quick slice of deluxe that is large and edible, this place works for same. There are better places, but this ain't bad."}
{"text":"This slice place was empty when I visited, and with Domino's across the street I guess that's why. Domino's is good, but they don't sell slices as far as I know. When you just want a quick slice, Pizza Pizza is the gut stuffer king of TO. Nice clean open space at this location with plenty of tables to park it at and free wifi too. The view is exceptional, looking out onto Lakeshore West with clean picture perfect windows. Nice way to spend some time gazing out. I got a big smile from the girl working there and a perfectly adequate deluxe. I would go again if I was waiting for the street car along this tranquil Toronto strip. It felt like a small town."}
{"text":"In a perfect world, Yelp would allow people to rate zero star's (so I have no choice but to rate it a 1).  The pizza that comes from Pizza Pizza truly is worst pizza you will ever taste... like ever.  It has nothing to do with the freshness (rather it be the single slices that sit in the glass trays for hours, to the fresh out of the oven pizza ordered for take out)... the problem with Pizza Pizza is their actual recipe.  I really do believe Pizza Pizza thinks their pizza actually tastes good.. which is HILARIOUS!  The head honcho's over at the company should rather change their god awful recipe, or change the company name to Terrible Terrible Pizza Pizza.  People only buy this crap because it's cheap, and on every street corner in the city.  The actual taste of the pizza is so revolting that I can't believe people continue to buy this pizza time and time again AFTER finding out how terrible it is. It tasted like crap in 2003, and 10 years later, it tastes just as yummy  ;)  The only thing I like about Pizza Pizza (no... it's not the pizza), is that certain days of the week u can order yummy side kicks like a Meatball sub for a few bucks. Hey! I'm not gonna argue with that! I'de get it like once a month."}
{"text":"Do not come to this location for pizza. I ordered pick up and my order took longer than 20 min. Lady on the phone told me 20 min or it's free. After 25 min I asked if my order was free. The employee who makes the pizza told me I had to pay even though they violated their policy. Cashier gave it to me for free but not before the pizza guy shouted out racial slurs to me. I asked him politely, what did you just call me? He said I was a f**g chinaman, and said it twice. I couldn't believe my ears because first of all, I am a woman, and secondly, he is also a racial minority.  I have lived in Canada for over 50 years and never in my life has anyone ever called me something like that. I am proud to be Canadian and respect all types of cultures. I am shocked that this gentleman who works at 8601 Warden can talk to customers with such foul language. I know this is an isolated incident because I have frequented this store many many times in the past. I just hope other customers will never be subjected to this type of treatment. IPizza Pizza needs to train this guy on some manners if they want to keep their customers."}
{"text":"Love going to this place right near me! When they first opened service was super slow, but with new staff it's a lot better. I've tried their thin crust personal pizza of the day for $5 and was pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Of course you lower your expectations as soon as you cross the threshold into any Pizza Pizza, but this one on bustling Queen St. West assaults you with a stench of greasy slag that almost knocks you back out onto the street. Once you are over that and immersed in the fumes, the modern look and two storey layout is quite interesting. And the menu has expanded for the modern times as well, maybe too much as the staff seems as if they are stiff and unable to move quickly. If they were sliding out slice after slice possibly there wouldn't be a lineup. Instead there are drawn out conversations at the til and you might have to wait a few minutes for your order unless you end up being luckier than me."}
{"text":"Have always ordered my pizza from this pizza pizza location. Have always been pleased with the way they make their pizza. I particularly like their crust because it's very nice and crunch from the bottom and fluffy in the middle. Not very greasy. They have a good sitting area inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Poor customer service and just average pizzas. In the past it was usually hit and miss with the pizzas at the store with a 50% chance of getting a good pizza. The pizzas made here today are acceptable but nothing \"wows\" me. However, I am still greatly disappointed with the lack of customer service.  On one of my last visits a while ago I decided to order something since I was in the nearby mall. I was standing in line for so long even though there were only a few customers ahead of me. I felt invisible because the cashier didn't take the time to acknowledge that I was standing there or greet me or even say that he would be right with me like some other stores do. I decided to get the $4.99 medium pepperoni walk in special, but when I proceeded to pay by credit card the cashier informed me that they don't accept credit cards for orders under $5.00. So I asked him, \"Why is that?\" He just replied, \"That is store policy, not my policy!\" and put his palms flat on his chest as he said that. How rude! Before I had even completed my transaction, a younger fellow customer came up to the counter and complained that the pepperoni on his pizza was burnt. Another employee actually told him that it is Brooklyn pepperoni and it's supposed to look like that. As he walked away the employee offered to make him a new pizza, but he didn't look happy.   I have more experiences at this place that I left out, but this is another classic example of how Pizza Pizza doesn't try very hard to earn your business anymore like they did around 1994, and now they claim to be the number one pizza in Ontario by doing nothing extraordinary. They just opened lots of stores everywhere and people end up ordering from them. Even McDonalds trains their employees and usually has people with good customer skills."}
{"text":"What a lousy experience! Around Dec 2014, I was tired and hungry on this night so I opted for an extra large 2 topping pizza with a dipping sauce. I ordered over the phone and picked it up. The cashier didn't give me a receipt (which seems to be a trend at most stores since it has an online survey for free items). When I tried the pizza at home it was awful; very dry and there was barely any sauce on it. I even tried a slice from another side and it tasted like dry bread and cheese. The pizza crust looked cardboard thin. I phoned Pizza Pizza and the customer service rep offered me a free replacement pizza.   And so I spent my time and gas driving back to the store around 11pm on a cold night. I told the cashier that I had come to pick up my replacement pizza (which I had never done before at this location). Some guy in a black shirt, who I assume was the manager, walked to the counter with another employee and in front of everyone said to me that this was the last time that he was giving this (replacement pizza) to me and that if I have any problem I should come to them first instead of calling Pizza Pizza.   I tried to explain that I don't live near the store (and I don't have their individual store phone number). He went on to ask me what was wrong with the first pizza and when I said that there was barely any sauce, he gave me a strange look like I was there to scam them for free pizzas. Then he proceeded to tell me that he preferred if I would have brought the first pizza back. I was too tired to argue and took the replacement pizza and left. Not a single apology for the inconvenience and the manager only cared about his store rather than his customers. The replacement was only slightly better with a little more sauce, but still not up to standards (I've been a Pizza Pizza customer since 1994).  I felt very offended with the rude and unprofessional treatment, and what the manager said and did was against their policy. I must have been coming to this location for at least 10 years. I would always recommend this place to family and friends and give them good reviews/ratings when filling in the Pizza Pizza online survey. Of course, I called Pizza Pizza the next morning and explained what had happened. But Pizza Pizza doesn't really seem to do much to follow up with their customers and actually resolve problems."}
{"text":"This store is a little out of the way for me, but if my friend and I are in the area we mostly order one of their walk-in pizza specials with pepperoni, dipping sauces and maybe pop, or other deals on rare occasions. All the employees appear to be from the same country and speak the same language, but I don't mind and they seem friendly. This is a descent and  average pizza place. There's nothing that goes above and beyond to make me say \"wow\", but everything looks right from the customer service to the product. There are usually seats and tables available as well and it doesn't seem crowded or too noisy during my evening visits. I've been coming here for a few years with zero issues so far."}
{"text":"We've never used their delivery service, only walk-in orders. Counter service has been hit or miss. We've never ordered a \"standard\" pizza though, always a 3 topping special with whole wheat thick crust, special sauce and lightly done.  When they rush the order entry into the system, they always miss those things and mess up something in the order, usually burning the pizza in the process. When they take their time, and do it right, the pizza has been fantastic!  Make sure your receipt shows exactly how you want your pizza done, and you won't be disappointed... Watch out for their \"specials\" though... I've been overcharged in the past when they enter a special as a standard order and miss the discount."}
{"text":"I normally don't review fast food chains but the service here was horrible.   I ordered a simple pepperoni pizza and wings shortly after 1pm and sat down to wait. A few minutes later a guy comes rushing out from the kitchen with a long order list for a large delivery. Over 20 minutes later they finish the order and then start my order!! By the end I had waited over half an hour and when I picked up I asked if it was going to be free since it took more than 30 minutes. She laughed because she thought I was joking but when she saw I wasn't she said I was lucky to get it in half an hour because they usually take an hour.   WHAT?!?"}
{"text":"This place is terrible, I walked in to have a veggie slice, not available. Ok I'll wait 15 mins, nope no plan is making one.ok I'll take a cheese slice. It was like I was eating card board. The peppers were all empty. The bathroom was disgusting. Staff seemed disinterested, wish there was a toppers or pizza nova around here."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a pizza experience highlighted by incompetent, inaccurate and uncaring this is the place.  Today (4/28/18) I called the hotline, interested in ordering 2 Pizza for Smiles promo pizzas, a fundraiser for the Children's Miracle Network. In the interest of full disclosure I have not ordered ANYTHING from this chain, because in the past they NEVER got an order right, and I got sick and tired of meaningless credits. But I wanted to support the cause and had had a positive walk-in experience at the Bovaird and Hurontario location two days before.    So I called with the intention to place the order for walk-in. I was told by one customer service staff that I could only place the order for walk-in if I added a regular menu item. Nothing like a classic Pizza Pizza money grab right off the top. I told the staff that I only wished to order two of the promo pizzas and asked kindly if they could simply place the order to save me the trouble of waiting unnecessarily at the store. The staff said they could not help, nor the manager they transferred me to. After hanging up it occurred to me to call back to see if I could place the order directly through the store. Surprise, surprise no simple fix there, they do not provide store numbers, could not simply transfer me and of course no one offered to contact the store on my behalf. But they were happy to do so if I added an expensive and unwanted other item.   I drove 15 min the cold to the store. I placed the order with staff Kajal, who could not navigate her own register, as she tried to charge me $6.99 for the 5.99 promo item, which I pointed out and had her correct. I asked that the pizzas be prepared with a garlic pizza base and they placed the order, took my money and I waited 20 min. When they brought the pizza, I asked if it was prepared as to order. Lord and behold, NO, tomato base. A manager, who wore no badge and did not provide a name, told me I would have to accept the pizza as is and they would provide a garlic dipping sauce. At this point, for obvious reasons I had reached my limit and refused and they just refunded my money, and withheld the receipt from me when I asked for the complaints number. They provided me with my order number handwritten on register paper.  Now for an additional sparkling Pizza Pizza telephone customer service experience. I called back and waited through muzak, repeatedly called, as mysteriously calls to the customer service extension kept disconnecting, before being connected to Amal. He offered weak apologies and said he could not do anything. I should note I began this rollercoaster at 8PM, but this time it was 10 PM and I am seated in my car, in the cold, after having driven to the store for nothing, STARVING! I asked to speak to another manager and was transferred to Susan, #9236. She condescendingly told me, \"Well they gave you your money back\", after speaking  to her  and waiting on 3 separate occasions on hold for her to hunt down the transaction and communicate with the store. She indicated the store tried to appease me by giving me dipping sauce and that they could not substitute the sauce in store. I replied that the store I went to Friday happily did so (let's be real, its the difference of squeezing two bottles), after refusing to take my order over the phone, making me drive in the cold to and from the store, not notifying me at POS that they substitution was not possible, that giving me my money back was not an excuse for their unprofessional behavior or the farcical experience. She stated there was nothing to be done. I asked to escalate the matter further. To be honest by this point it was clear that Pizza Pizza's customer service was the equivalent of a fart in the air, no substance, smelled bad and inescapable. I spoke with Alan, who heard me out and agreed to confer as to remuneration for my time. He put me on hold, AGAIN for another 5-8 minutes of time, after he acknowledged the service experience was abysmal, that mistakes were made by staff, that I wasted gas to drive to the store (at 134 a gallon, not a small price), time and was left hungry.  But he of course returned and chimed there was \"nothing else to do\", as they had done me the GRAND GESTURE OF GIVING ME MY MONEY BACK. You eating here? It could not be more clear this chain does NOT care about customers, has no customer service skills, and cannot deliver a basic cheese pizza with a pepperoni smile, for charity, to its customers. God forbid you order something complicated."}
{"text":"- pizza pizza is a pretty standard joint - much love to the fact that they've taken their brand a long way. - this location however, although was really really lacking in their pizza slices choice and freshness. - walked in on a tuesday evening, and found that all the pizzas they had on display were dried out, really lacking any edible appeal, as well as toppings. super chincy. - never again for this specific location."}
{"text":"Came here for their $8.99 weekday lunch special. I came right when it opened at 11:30am so it wasn't busy.   Pros - Great pizza - Great price   Cons - The waitress was great but there was only one and she was running around which definitely slowed down the service. THEY NEED MORE SERVERS. -small selection but for the price it's not bad."}
{"text":"Flies on the pizza that was sitting out there.  Ew.  Very disgusting.  I would NOT recommend it ... very unsanitary!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza, said 45 mins. I called around 40 mins in, got put on hold, 15 mins then someone else picks up. So the first guy clearly just put me on hold and left me. 2nd guy says I need your hotel phone number which I wasn't about to look up again so when I asked to speak with a manager he hung up. Terrible."}
{"text":"Came here at night on a Sunday   Pros: - Quick service  - Good taste  Cons: - Well its a pizza place so not the prettiest atmosphere"}
{"text":"Good pizza in Toronto is almost nonexistant. So to be rated with one star is good. Can pizza pizza even be considered real food. Im surprised to see two other ratings and so high... my gawd... This is got to be the worse food substitue ever.  The box it comes in taste better.  lol... :)"}
{"text":"It was the worse experience ever, The delivery man could not use the interact machine, he was rushing to other orders, he gave me the pizza and will comeback later to take the money. 5 minutes later  I got phone call from the store screaming and threatening to call the cop if I did not pay for the pizza.  I felt humiliated and installed, definitely NOT recommended to anyone."}
{"text":"Pizza is hard to mess up but they did it anyway! Uneven crust thickness and little sauce... Plus unfriendly service..."}
{"text":"This location is pretty good if you just get their freshest slices, or their walk in special (usually a plain pepperoni pizza). It takes a lot of practice though to be able to visually identify the freshest slices, you'll have to ask them first which ones are the newest and which ones are the oldest. But between the 5th and 10th time you'll be able to do it on your own.  I never order Pizza Pizza for delivery though, because Ginos and Dominos taste a lot better and their quality is much more consistent between locations and even the day of the week."}
{"text":"This place should be condemned! I walked in here because my four year old nephew was hungry and wanted a slice. After a beautiful walk on the Beaches boardwalk this was the nightmare that felt like it  would never end.  This place was filthy and I have pictures to prove it. Not one of the cooks wore gloves or hat, there were chicken bones and sauce all over the furniture and floor (I have pictures)and the cashier lady kept scratching her head.  But since my nephew insisted we stood in a line with 8 people in front of us and it took them an hour to serve us. While waiting we heard them use \"R\" rated proanities at customers, yell at little kids and generally mess up almost all orders. When I mentioned to my brother in law how ridiculous this was, the cashier lady started fighting with me. I have never ever been treated so badly and felt really bad for our family visiting from Colorado who had loved Toronto up until then."}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza pizza.....my pizza was under cooked. I went up to show them this as u could clearly see it had only been warmed at most.The very rude girl at the front said \" No, its not under cooked....if it was cooked anymore it would be burned \".There wasn't even one part of the slice that was brown...Why have people handling the front if they don't know anything about customer service!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I ordered pizza from La Rose Ave.location and it will be the last my first pizza a few weeks ago it came cold and it looked like it fell in the car,this time I wanted to give them another try and i regret it wasting my money on a two pizza deal, it tasted like I was eating cardboard  it had almost no cheese it came cold even thou I live 1km from this place complete disappointment had to throw almost all the pizza in the trash and it cost me $25 and was so pissed off that i didn't even want to call to complain because i was so upset never ever getting a slice from this place ."}
{"text":"For the price, it's good pizza. Service always good and our order is always correct. They have good walk-in deals and their delivery is never late or cold.  If you're going to eat-in or walk-in, there is ample seating to wait and eat. It's clean and there are always a few newspapers to browse. They also have CP24 on the TV.  Yes, other places make better pizza, but if you want pizza on a budget or for a large group, this place is the way to go."}
{"text":"Surprised some friends at Pearson prior to their connecting flight home. Looking for a place to visit and get a bite, we stopped at the first place we came across outside of security.  The main things we were looking for: quick service, kid friendly, decent airport prices and BEER.  This place was located in a small food court. So lots of seating to accommodate our larger group.   The pizza is nothing to write home about. Nothing was freshly cooked when we got there. It looked and tasted like it had been under the heat lamp too long. But it curbed the hunger in us all. They had only 2 options of beer, which is fine but you couldn't drink out of the bottle, they poured it into plastic cups with ice. Sorry but now I feel jipped and my beer is watered down.   I was going to give this two stars as it's not your fancy pizza place, but it's quick service at a major airport. However, as we were getting ready to leave my friend pointed out the staff cleaning their menu boards with a mop. The same mop they used on the floor just minutes ago. Seeing the droplets of water being flung about brought this place down to 1/5. :(   I am positive though it could get 2/5 if I had mentioned something to change their cleaning habits, like getting a step ladder and a cloth!  Nurse Rexy signing off..."}
{"text":"If you're looking to be disappointed, you've found the place!  Screwed up the same order 3 times in 2 weeks.  Seriously, if sauce is so expensive, charge more.  I won't go back.  Screw you!"}
{"text":"We've had problems with this place on there separate occasions, but when I stand at your counter, with four people on shift and nobody even acknowledges me for eight minutes I'm completely done with you."}
{"text":"Sadly this is our local franchise. We've had to complain more often than not, almost always \"out of\" certain ingredients, never hot when it arrives, almost never gold-topped pop, etc.   Really surprised corporate hasn't shut this franchise down."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever experienced. The oven wasn't even on when I walked in to order a pizza (5:50pm) and the guys were eating and taking with their mouth full. The Asian guy who took my order demanded my order and got impatient when I asked what the walk in price was for their large pizza (usually there's a poster in the front at the other locations). While I was giving them my order the guy was playing candy crush on his cell.There was garbage all over the floor with the smell of urine right by the cashier. Classy joint and a major disappointment compared to any other pizza pizza location."}
{"text":"CRAP CRAP CRAP!! God help me, I was fooled by their great photography and despite promising I would never give PizzaPizza another cent, I buckled and tried an \"italian style sandwich\" and slice.  I KNEW it was stupid even as I did it, but I was quickly made to pay for my short memory of all the previous crap PP has fed me disguised as italian food.  Bland, flavourless, truly horrid \"factory-fresh\" mystery meatballs, runny anglo-style tomato sauce, and how it is that Pizza Pizza manages to make their pizza crust so completely devoid of any flavour whatsoever is truly a mystery of science and franchising!!  Let me once again re-pledge, I don't care how much Pizza Pizza manages to redirect investment that would result in flavour, that instead goes for great advertising photos, their food will never, ever cross my lips, ever again, I swear, so help me Massimo!  Cheers,  .James."}
{"text":"It was just OK. It would have a higher review if they cut the pizza before I took it away. I am staying with my family at a nearby hotel and didn't realize we had to cut it with a plastic knife until I got back to the hotel. I'm from the US, and perhaps I don't know the cultural norms in Canada. But in the US, if you order a pizza to go, they cut it for you-in case you don't travel with a pizza cutter. I had to cut it in smaller pieces with a plastic knife, so it was small pieces of bread with a crap ton of tomato sauce, and then there were other pieces with just cheese. The fried pickles were just ok. I've had better."}
{"text":"Best Pizza Pizza I've ever been to in terms of pizza quality. The crust is always cooked perfectly and the toppings are fresh. Lots of places to sit in a clean environment."}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience from this store. I placed an order online for pick up. It was a panzerotti and while placing the order and about to check out I was informed to get a free dipping sauce, after everything I came to the store for pick up and then as I was about to receive the panzerotti, a man or one of the staff asked me for a code to get my free sauce, without the code I can't get my sauce. I didn't have a code cause it showed straight to my order that I will get it. It's included. The staff didn't care about my explanation, actually I didn't mind if I won't get the free sauce I just can't believe how that staff treated me, with that experience I called the office of pizza pizza and complain they said that I don't even have to show a code to get the free item. This store is so bad. The staff even said \"I can't just give away everything in my store.\" I just can't believe how could he talk to his customer like that? Since then I didn't come to this store no more. No wonder the store was so empty. THE SERVICE WAS SO BAD."}
{"text":"This is one of the cleanest pizza pizza store I have ever been. Even the washroom is very clean u can assure that they maintain cleanliness which is good coz that's one of the proofs the food is handled well. The cook is wearing gloves and apron. The service is good and the employees are very friendly. I am looking forward to coming back to this store than any other pizza pizza store in this area."}
{"text":"Garbage pizza, tastes like cardboard.  Worst franchise in Toronto.  But the Asian cashier was very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is what you'd expect of a Pizza Pizza. It ain't the Ritz Carlton, but is ain't a garbage dump either.  It didn't look filthy to me and I've always found the staff to be quite nice. It's usual late night (the only time i ever frequent a pizza pizza) and they aren't that busy. I've stopped in a few time on my way home from work when i hop off the streetie. I think to myself  \"should I be bad and pop into pizza pizza before the walk home?\" and sometimes the answer is yes. Only when i'm feeling really tired and starved and don't want to cook at 10 or 11 at night. The poutine is okay. Nothing fantastic."}
{"text":"Ok short guy get the money for the cash registre but doesn't wash his hands to do the pizza!!!!  No more going there...!"}
{"text":"There are so many better pizza options in Toronto, including Pizza Nova and Amato. This location is super convenient (right next to Spadina Station)/ but really nothing special."}
{"text":"This is my closest Pizza Pizza, so whether I like it or not - this is the one I get delivery from.  First of all, I like Pizza Pizza.  That helps.  People who review Pizza Pizza but don't like the pizza from here - you're not going to have a good experience!  There's a lot I like about it - I like the topping choices, I like the price point, I LOVE that you can order online and make all the customizations you want online.  I even like their pasta and chicken nuggets.   So I'm a fan of the product.  The actual service is hit and miss.  I've had creepy delivery men who've asked if I was home alone.  Don't even get me started if they're past the 40 minute mark - then you're basically going to get killed in your home (the delivery man pays for your pizza if you get it for free, so they get VERY MAD AT YOU if you try to enforce this policy).  One time the cook called me and asked me to pick it up because his delivery man got into an accident, and I was like, \"But the whole point of ordering is that I don't WANT to go pick-up?.....\"  seemed strange.  I still order from here because, Hell, they're open really late and sometimes you crave a creamy garlic sauce base on your pizza.  But it's not without annoyance."}
{"text":"The service is very slow. The first time we had pizza was ok. The second time I wanted to order a delivery , the person in the restaurant gave me one information , her colleague over the delivery phone  - another. At the end we cancelled the order. The third and last time for sure - we waited for 15 min and were totally ignored,  then we left. I won't bother going again."}
{"text":"The place sucks all of the franchise is a rip off there is lots of other places in town that are cheaper and better like pizza Nova, Dominos and Nonos Crupies go to any of these as they are a lot better, do not go there as they will rip you off and give you mediocre food!"}
{"text":"I've had mixed experiences with this location. In terms of the taste, it is like any other Pizza Pizza. In terms of toppings (how much they put on), its been a hit and miss for me. Most of the time they tend to cheap out and put less meat. But one time I went they put tons of pepperoni...   I'll continue going back here for the convenience, but just keep it mind that their topping quantity is very inconsistent!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest pizza (Marconi's is better and just around the corner), but reliable filler when you need something quick and simple for lunch or a late night snack."}
{"text":"it's always feels weird to go to a Pizza Pizza after midnight.  but I like their walk-in special, from Medium size pizza for $4.99, Large size for $7.99, to the special 10\" half size smile pizza for just $2!!  since they don't keep pizza precooked at night, you have to wait for about 10 - 15 minutes to get your pizza, but at least you get your pizza made to order and mouth burning hot!!  generally your experience at most location should be the same, the reason why I gave this one an \"A-OK\" remark is that they doesn't have anything on the free spice rack there. usually they have the rack well stock with different spice, garlic powder and/or peppers.  some only have red pepper flakes and garlic powder, but this location left the rack empty.  and for some reason they didn't hang the walk-in special banner outside, I had to go in there and ask, because they don't even have any sign inside the store mention anything about it.  13/15"}
{"text":"Great pizza and great service. I recently ordered take out from the iPad for $32 but when I went to pick it up, there had been a glitch which told them yo make 4 more pizzas then I ordered. They were very understanding and fixed my order. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"In a perfect world, we might all dine on potted periwinkles and tartare at Zagat-rated hotspots every night, but alas, that's just not financially realistic for most, so sometimes you just gotta go for something cheap, quick and consistent, and if there's one thing you can expect with a fast food chain it's consistency - consistent service, consistent menu, consistent quality - but in this case, I was absolutely flabbergasted by the inefficiency of the service because the counter person kept taking partial orders from myself and my friend while partially completing to-go orders and coming back to find out we also wanted onion rings and then coming back from the fryer to find out we also wanted potato wedges and coming back to find out we also wanted drinks and then I had to pay with the fucking weird debit contraption by carefully placing my card into a slot at the top but there are like 5 other places to swipe your card and suddenly I was overcome with the feeling that this fast pizza wasn't going to be worth my stolen identity but at least those onion rings and potato wedges fulfilled my deep-fried fantasies, and we enjoyed them immensely while watching fucking depressing CP24 on the TV and some sort of shady transaction between a man on a bike and his associate in the doorway, and on a final note: the pizza could use 300% more cheese."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza tonight. When it came there was a white slimy substance on the  crust!!!! I am disgusted. I called customer service but was put on hold for 15 mins and then I was disconnected. I will never order from here again"}
{"text":"Always something wrong with my order. Have had pizza be under cooked. Always feel like a rushed pizza was thrown together and not properly made. Have complained multiple times and hope this franchise gets new owners or management!"}
{"text":"go to dominos."}
{"text":"Service is okay. Place is clean. It's pizza pizza what do you expect? Fast cheap pizza. Definitely not gourmet. $4.99 for a medium pepperoni? Good cheap eats on the run. Once in a while it's okay!"}
{"text":"If you order from this location they send the most weirdest and rudest drivers to deliver your pizza...and that makes me question if my pizza is safe to eat :$"}
{"text":"Had a slice of pizza from here last time I was in town. It was greasy. Typical pizza. But fine. This time I got a panzorotti and the dough wasn't even cooked. Don't feel very good now. Sigh."}
{"text":"for THIS location a 1 star. I love pizza pizza but just like this one I was at downtown the employees ruin it. I've been going to pizza pizza for over 15 years and I really like their pizza, their creamy garlid sauce I'd buy constantly if they sold it in stores how much I like it. Anyone local knows that Licks does this so why not them as they are both Ontario based companies.   They are opened really late so it's fantastic for anyone getting off work or coming home from the bar, they will cook anything you want on the menu too and it's not too long or not too fast. The location is easy to find and there is always parking.   however.. 1- they are dirty, every half hour or when things slow down how hard is it to go out and spray the tables.   2- it's been -15 to -28 the week I've been writing this...AND.. they don't have any heat on. I ate a pizza there and could practically see my breath. Anyone looking in would think we're smoking and go wow what badasses.  3- they got all the seasonings out but no tabasco sauce or anything special The owner seems like a cheapskate for 2 reasons now.   4-the employees are ALL indian. the odd this or that. I don't care where you're from I hate you all the same if you're an idiot. But a bunch of things come to mind. The first is the employees don't know the menu well and have probably never eaten there. They all have that thick fresh off the boat accent \"do you want it baked or fried\" sounded like do you want bacon or fries. I grew up in the west end and either I'm losing my touch or they are really that incomprehensible. Both of which I really question the guy hiring everyone if it is based on skill or just they match his pigmentation.The mcdonalds next door should hire him and strip him of any power (no i've never considered a job there and this isn't spite.   I'm glad this place got smaller where chicken joy took a few of the dirty tables saturated in pizza slop away from the \"qualified\" employees. I'm glad taco bell came and is taking some of their business and I swear their late hours and the beer store are the only thing keeping them in business. I avoid this place like the plague as there is ALWAYS a bum asking for a dollar (not change) outside and they don't have the balls to tell them to shoo or the imitative to phone security. No its a pay cheque for them and they don't care. I hope they go belly up like that dollar store by nofrills.   ways to improve 1- clean your restaurant, it's way easier than finding another job. If I owned the place and saw how filthy it was I'd fire whoever is in charge of the windex bottle.  2- turn the heat  on! if its cold outside and we can see our breath that has to be a health code violation. We as customers like the option of sitting down. You know.. having a conversation in restaurants without freezing to the table before our pizza is cooked right?   3- hire people who know the food ..there is 6 apartments nearby easily and I'm sure some of them know the difference between bacons, what a canoli is and so forth.  4- don't be cheap with napkins, put out a bottle of hot sauce or 3 and you know you bean counting managers are cheap."}
{"text":"Wow. this was a pretty terrible meal for way too much $$$.  The Hawaiian pizza was tasteless and she stuffed it in the oven for 1 min and expected it to be warm- NOT.  The chicken wings were TINY and not very tasty. The fries were the only thing that was passable...   Won't be back"}
{"text":"Strictly average chain pizza experience. Staff is courteous, but not above average in terms of professionalism or knowledge. The pizza is above average for the particular chain. The wings are basically frozen store-bought fare. Rather expensive to dine by the slice. Eat in facilities are marginal but adequate."}
{"text":"Absolute garbage service. Ordered a pizza at around 1 am since I was hungry and thid location was still open. An hour later it was still not here. I call them and they say no order at my address is listed on their record. So I order another one. It came within 37 minutes. 3 minutes more and I would have demanded it for free (they did give a time guarantee though). So I got my pizza which I ordered at 1 am, at around 2:45 am.   And the pizza itself had barely any onions though I ordered onions on it, and was bland as hell.  DO NOT ORDER HERE. FIND ANOTHER PIZZA PLACE. IT SUCKS."}
{"text":"Atty Galang recommend pizza pizza for me to try and surprisingly it was really good and the servers are friendly and recommend place to see"}
{"text":"Below Average Overall. Customer Service is terrible. The cashier's never smile, and it's easy to tell that they hate their job. Cashiers distasteful attitude makes you feel awkward/uncomfortable immediately.   The Pizza's themselves are never consistent and below average. The box for my last pizza was so damaged and bent out of shape that the lid would not close. When I asked for a new box the cashier gave me a dirty look and dumped my pizza into a new box. This was the last straw for me; I'm never ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"Eh...it's pizza pizza. Looks like pizza. Tastes like what you would expect. Comes hot, maybe fresh.   Not a lot of other places open here at midnight.  Washrooms aren't too clean and smells a bit weird.   Oh, I think their Large with 3 toppings and 3 cans has actually gotten cheaper from before cause we got it for $13.99 plus tax."}
{"text":"Pizza Pizza are the hot dog purveyors of the pizza-world in Toronto, they are everywhere (Oh, pourquoi?) and their quality is generally less than par. They are your basic \"I am starving. I want pizza. Oh... no better pizza place in sight? Oh, okay. Then I guess, Pizza Pizza it is.\"   In fact their standing on top of hot dogs is partly merited on the fact that you can seat down at one of their locations, use their bathroom while chances are that you will eat a hot dog outdoors and standing. Since in reality they are almost the same price.   A few years ago, I read a review on Now Magazine hailing Pizza Pizza as the 'best pizza' in Toronto.  Seriously? ...You Maniacs! You eat it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell! :P  Anyway, the point is that Pizza Pizza overall is probably better as a delivered pizza  than the many, dry and crusty pizza they sell you by the slice. Since if they made it to order, at least you know it is fresh. Unlike the carbon dating you wish you could do on some of those slices.   Now this particular location is probably a bit better than most simply because of the higher traffic forces them keep making new pizza. I have gone here when the hotdog vendor is not at Yonge and Bloor but generally, unless I am lazy at home and decide to pick i upt/have it delivered, generally I do not bother with any Pizza Pizza as there are a few other places in the hood which are better.   As far as service, I never had any real issue with them and they seem service oriented enough.   Fun Fact: If you MUST order than do it online. Not over the phone, you get a few extra options if you do it, plus sometimes, depending on what you get it might be less expensive if they have a special."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars!  We were here on new year's eve. Nothing was open. It was snowing & we were hungry.   The place looks clean & the staff was friendly. We got the pepperoni pizza & the poutine. The pepperoni pizza was just decent, nothing special. The poutine was pretty good, flavorful!   2 slices of pepperoni pizza, 2 sodas, & 1 poutine, all total we spent $12.63."}
{"text":"Not the best tasting pizza but it did the trick lol! Dirty bathrooms downstairs with no paper towel or toilet paper. When my friend informed the manager she told another worker to lock the bathroom instead of sending them to clean the bathroom- LAZY WORKERS. Needless to say I won't be returning...."}
{"text":"Pizza Pizza is everywhere in Toronto. It's not amazing pizza. But it's consistently decent, IMO. I have friends who'd never eat a slice at a Pizza Pizza, but I'd say it's above average, better than a lot of dive pizza shops.   What it isn't is great pizza. It's no Amato's, let alone Queen Margherita or Pizzeria Libretto. It's not gourmet. It's just solid, inexpensive, omnipresent chain pizza. If that's what you're looking for, you'll probably be reasonably happy here.  The tables could often use cleaning, the walk-in specials are usually a pretty good deal as long as you're willing to eat it, and even the extras (onion rings, fries, chicken) are pretty decent, considering."}
{"text":"Not a fan of chain pizza in general but sometimes it somehow happens that other people make you eat this garbage food.  And pizza pizza is not a great pizza. Just another mediocre pizza among how many other mediocre pizzas?"}
{"text":"As standard issue as any Pizza Pizza gets. Nothing to be excited about here.   We all know Pizza Pizza and its use: To purchase whole or by the slice when the end of days comes, you get side-swiped by a car, hit your head, suffer amnesia and have forgotten the existence of any other purveyors of pizza and... you just happen to have a rumbling tummy. Or, it's late and you're tipsy.   Either way, it should not be your first choice but if you must, then this location is not too bad. Close to Spadina station and stays open late, just be careful to not purchase the stale slices. Trust me they are there, keep an eye on that.   Do not use the bathrooms here."}
{"text":"I gave this a three star because I find it all depends on the person who is working at this location that can really make or break your experience. For example today I bought this wing box deal that they offer (10 wings, 10 boneless bites, and two sides of your choice-fried foods like fries or onion rings) and man am I disappointed. Wings were so dry, lacking sauce and this is AFTER I told them to add more sauce on the wings and the guy in the back decides to tell me it's extra (lol nice try, not my first time getting this order but whatever). Who really puts up a fight over extra sauce? Anyways, before when I got this same deal, they sauced the wings all over, and gladly gave me extra sauce and everything was perfect.  Like I said it unfortunately is all about who you get at this location because some workers are really nice here and try to make everyone happy, whereas some are just plain annoying. Best advice I can give is always be sure to check your food before leaving the store so if there's anything not to your standard it can be fixed immediately"}
{"text":"Why is it that I remember the crust to be more doughy?  The slice I had here seemed like it was made by crumbling saltine crackers and then reforming it into dough. The slice I had was edible, maybe my mind was playing tricks on me...."}

{"text":"Note: Update is below. --- Time: 6:00 PM - 6:50 PM (That's right - 50 minutes!) Date: 31 March 2015 Order: Medium pepperoni walk in special ($4.99 + tax) w/ creamy garlic base sauce Rating: 1/5 stars (if I could give 0 or negative, I would...trust me).  First Pizza: - Gave me wrong pizza. Gave me cheese instead of pepperoni I had ordered the $4.99 medium pepperoni walk in special pizza and instead I got a cheese pizza.  - Not too big of a deal as I do know mistakes can occur, the only issue I had at this point in time was that they were not apologetic at all about the clearly obvious mistake - I requested them kindly to make me the correct pizza that I ordered  Second Pizza: - Didn't make a new pizza after they screwed up order. They simply put pepperoni on it (Note: It seems as if they just left it alone for a few minutes as it was COLD and clearly did not take much effort to throw on some cold slices of pepperoni) The pepperoni was not even cooked, they literally threw on slabs of pepperoni onto the pizza. - At this point I was just furious. I told the female employee that I would like a refund.  The employee then said that she did not know how to refund me with my credit card, i was extremely surprised by this statement as this should be something every employee should know. This demonstrated the clear incompetence and lack of training at this store - The employee then offered me cash instead which I declined (I personally hate carrying around cash). - I think asked just for a new pizza and to make sure it was right this time... (third time's the charm...fingers crossed). - Also note: No apologies whatsoever or any sort of 'extras' offered at this point  Third Pizza: - Not even 1/2 the amount of garlic base sauce I receive from other Pizza Pizza locations, but by this point I am too pissed off and just want to go home.  Conclusion: Will definitely never come to this location ever again. Lack of training, lack of competence, insincere staff...not impressed in the slightest. Would not recommend this place. --- EDIT: I have gone back to this Pizza Pizza location approximately 4 more times after the initial terrible incident. I'm assuming someone must have called this location and discussed their concerns - since then I have been impressed with their service and Pizza - updating the rating to a 4/5."}
{"text":"worst pizza and service ever, the workers look over worked and miserable. The pizza is also crap. They must be trying to cut cost so much that the pizza slices barely have any tomato sauce and you feel like you're eating a open faced cheese and pepperoni sandwich. Dipping sauce does not save this pizza. It's so dry."}
{"text":"The quality & service sucks here.  I'm not coming here again EVER!"}
{"text":"Had a pizza delivered from this store.  Pizza tasted fine (seemed like it was cooked with a Domino's style pressure oven as opposed to the Baker's Pride oven which I prefer) but I don't recommend patronizing this place because I ordered a 12\" pizza and seeing how the pie didn't quite fit the box, measured it and found it was only 11-1/4\".  Totally unacceptable.  That 3/4\" shortfall is ripping off the customer tremendously.  There is NO excuse for this.  Pizzas are made on circular trays(?) which provide for relatively consistent sizes.  Even if the same amount of dough was used (it didn't taste extra doughy), that's a lot less toppings used.  Observe:  12\" pizza = 3.14 * (6^2) = 113.04 sq, in....  11-1/4\" pizza = 3.14 * (5.625^2) =  99.35 sq. in. -- 12% less pizza or 13.69 sq. in less or a 3.7\" square of pizza missing.  I'm still hungry because of this missing amount.  Also, the receipt doesn't specify the delivery charge (Domino's does) but lumps it all together with the price of the pizza.  Something to hide?  AVOID this establishment.  They must be taught a lesson."}
{"text":"Pizza Pizza pizza is generally pretty subpar. They don't offer dairy-free slices, so I can't really speak of the quality of pizza they have here. But what I CAN talk about is the bathrooms.  It was 3 in the morning and I was desperate. I was pointed to an unmarked door that led to a set of stairs to the basement. That is where the bathrooms are. For those of you who have seen Trainspotting, the bathrooms here are maybe a notch above the bathroom in the movie. The toilets didn't flush and it was generally gross. If you want to prepare yourself for the bathrooms in Asia, I recommend visiting this bathroom as much as possible, as aside from the fact that these are sitting toilets (not that you'd want to), it's about the same thing."}
{"text":"Disgusting and unsanitary Old pizza,  poor quality, terrible service too,  I called and left a complaint Avoid!!!"}
{"text":"Really annoyed.  Just made a delivery order and they ran out of an item early Sunday (not even near end of shift), so I had to replace with another item I didn't really want since I was worried they wouldn't give me my money back (I had already paid online).  They also left out the feta cheese and salad dressing on my Greek salad and their 'chocolate pie' was a block of cheap a$$ chocolate I would rather throw in the garbage than eat.  Don't call it a chocolate pie if it's not a chocolate pie!! Really simple! Don't deceive your customers so blatantly! Even the photo online is deceiving.  Only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because I previously received better service from this branch.  So disappointed."}

Dont get me started on the sanitary levels here. I was looking at how they make the pizzas and there is one guy he dropped the toppings on the floor, picked it up and put it on the pizza. One more thing. I noticed the employees at the cash handle dirty money then without washing their hands go and put topping on the pizza. I am absolutly disgusted and will never again eat here.  P.s i threw the pizzq in the garbage what a waste of money. Pf"}
{"text":"Ordered a \"fiery hot\" chicken pizza, expecting decent spice. I eat spicy Chinese soups, dishes, and all kinds of hot Indian foods. This pizza, however, was beyond hot. All that I could taste was heat borderline painful, with zero flavour. flavour. There wasn't even any tomato sauce. Two of my friends who also enjoy hot foods couldn't handle this either. If they were tasting what they were making, this pizza would have never been made like this. It felt like we were the butt of a practical joke, will not be ordering from here again."}

{"text":"If you want cheap, fast pizza then Pizza PIzza is the place for you.  My most recent trip I had the panzerotti.  I lucked out, it was fresh and just came out of the oven.  It tasted great.   However they charge extra for the tomato sauce on the side.  WTF?  Pizza Pizza was founded by an Italian.  No self respecting Italian eats panzerotti without sauce so why do you charge extra for it.  We find that Dominoes and 2 for 1, have more consistent quality on their offerings."}

{"text":"*Late review  Both Toronto Raptors (basketball) and Toronto Maple Leafs (hockey) made it to their respective playoffs so Pizza Pizza actually made deals involving both!  I actually went with the hockey version of the deal, titled \"Score Savings!\". It consisted of 2 Medium Pizzas (4 toppings combined), 6 cans of soft drink of your choice, and 2 dipping sauces.  For the pizza, we got one with pepperoni and bacon crumbles and one with mini meatball and mushrooms. Cans of soft drink include root beer, sprite and coke. I also ordered a large side of potato wedges to share since I'm not a big fan of pizza. We got the creamy garlic dipping sauce. Even though it's the most basic one, but it's so good!  Service was okay, nothing special to mention about.  Though I have to say that on the mushrooms and mini meatball pizza that they barely gave any meatball - only about one piece (which is like half of a meatball) per slice which is really cheap and definitely not a topping worth getting. The potato wedges were bomb as any other potato wedges because I laaav potatoes."}
{"text":"Super cheap not bad good crispy slice middle of the road. Overall quick service lots of selections."}
{"text":"They forgot my order and I was sitting in there for 30 mins. The cashier was really rude. Didn't apologize for forgetting even after showing the bill. Won't be going in there again."}
{"text":"I admit I'm a regular here because of the location and prices.  The pizza is fine and usually ready in 15 minutes.  But, I've encountered several issues including the following: - the garbage and recycling bins are often overflowing shortly after opening (i.e. not emptied at the end of the previous day)  - the women's washroom is dirty even shortly after opening time with the toilet seat up. I can only hope that the men's washroom is cleaner because all the employees I've seen are male. - the tables are often dirty - once, one of the two doors into the restaurant was locked.  I pointed this out to the person behind the counter and his response was a shrug.   - the front staff are not familiar with the Club 11-11 rewards program even though there is a sign with basic info about it on the counter.  They have to ask for help from someone in the back.  My advice to the owner of this franchise is to train the staff better and keep the place clean."}
{"text":"By the far the best \"chain\" pizza you will find on the west island. Not only do they have reasonable prices, the Pizza is great. It's thin, it has tasty tomatoe sauce, fresh toppings and the cheese is well cooked. It's easy to order online and there is also sometimes great specials-- so keep an eye out for flyers and coupons in your mail."}
{"text":"Had to update my review to 4 stars after trying out a mushrooms pizza with dairy free cheeze.  Made fresh to order. Tastes great. Quick and friendly service. Opens late. Clean and spacious place for those who like to dine in. Price is very affordable. Cheaper than frozen pizza! My advice is stick to veggie toppings and dairy free cheeze."}
{"text":"Pizza pizza is a franchise restaurant, so you're never going to be overly disappointed. But I have to say that I was very pleased with the selection here.   They put up a Pizzaiolio about 15 minutes from her,  but I will say for the the single slice special, I'd rather come to pizza pizza. That being said, this location, I find, is better than most for the service, which was very friendly and accommodating (our friend took a long time to order)."}
{"text":"The ordering was quick. The guy behind the counter was cheerful and prompt.   The location was clean, however on a very cold day the heating was not working. It was cold inside. No matter how much the oven was working it wasn't enough to warm the store.   The pizzas baked well and the toppings topped generously."}
{"text":"Today I went to the Pizza Pizza located at Queen and McCaul, Toronto, Ontario. I was VERY VERY displeased with the service. I went with my younger brother, and i instructed him to order, the worker walked back and forth several times within earshot while several other workers were making pizza on the near by table. She was free to access us, but instead chose to ignore my brother. He said \"excuse me,\" several times, when she did not respond i finally asked her for assistant, she reluctantly came over and asked us what we wanted. I requested a pepperoni slice, she said they were all out and the wait would be 10 minutes, i pointed to the sqaure pepperoni sqaure slices and asked why i couldn't just have one of those. She then put my pizza into the oven to warm up, my brother asked her if he could have a side of fries, she again choose to ignore him, i instructed him to ask her again louder, he did, and again she ignored him. I then asked her, she said that \"well, i would have to make them.\" I had enough, so i said no thanks i dont want to wait. She asked if i wanted anything else, i said \"can i have a garlic dipping sauce,\" she nodded her head, but didn't give it to me. I asked her for it again, she said \" you didn't ask for it.\" I said that i did, she AGAIN reluctantly gave it to me. When she took the pizza out of the oven she slid it across the counter and walked again, I had to bag it myself. I AM VERY DISPLEASED WITH THE SERVICE AT THIS LOCATION. I AM ASTOUNDED AS THIS IS A VERY BUSY LOCATION AND WOULD EXPECT BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE!"}
{"text":"I had some unexpected trade people who stayed over at home for a job to finish at home. Did. It want them to go hungry, so thought of picking up a pizza for them.   The location only had a few people there and the order was quickly taken for a XL Pizza with 2 toppings (mushrooms and hot peppers) for under $10 +taxes and extra for drinks. Which was quite reasonable- considering it was meant for 3 adults.   The order did. It take 20 minutes as mentioned by the cashier, a lot less I would say. The pizza looked amazing.   The seating area and places near the counter - not so much. I have seen many people dine in and have done it myself once here. If this was the condition- I would have chosen not to."}
{"text":"With a Pizza Pizza haunting every corner, bus stop and intersection, it's hard to come here without being at least a little bit tempted by the green and yellow logo. It breaks you until you can't help yourself. This said, the pizza here isn't bad. It's not fantastic but it's what you would expect from a franchised operation that probably attracts most of its clientele by slowly beating down their resistance. And they ARE hard to resist because, as I said, they are EVERYWHERE.  For those who order take out or delivery, they have that build your own function, which not only allows you to choose from a standard range of toppings, but to also select a sauce (Italian home-style tomato, creamy garlic parmesan and bruschetta are amongst the choices).  The website claims they're Ontario's #1 pizzeria but it really seems like they're Ontario's ONLY pizza shop."}

{"text":"Absolutely rude staff. We came here for the free pizza slice that was awarded to anyone who attended the Toronto Raptors game, after they got 100+ points. We only had the digital tickets, like many people, then he told us they only accepted physical copies because their scanner was 'down' conveniently. Then we tried asking if we would still do it and they looked at us with nasty faces. Never going back. The pizza by the way is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Absolute worst customer service experience ever. Ordered over the phone, order was not there when went to pick-up for a business lunch. Pizza pizza had called to confirm (1 time but was later told that they called 3 times and I was lying) but I missed the call. We arrived at the location 1 minute after I missed the call.  Then proceeded to spend my entire lunch on the phone complaining to customer service, only to be told it was my fault and I should pay more attention next time.   A supervisor called back an hour later, very pleasant, and gave me a credit.  This culminated in me trying to use the credit today, and was told that no credit existed and I was lying about the call from the supervisor.  I WILL NEVER EAT AT PIZZA PIZZA AGAIN. I have also told my colleagues who do lunch orderings and they will not order from Pizza Pizza again."}

{"text":"I'm not into hot spicy food. Got a pepperoni pizza and it was really spicy hot. I get it, the area is ethnic lack of a better word, but I don't eat hot spicy foods. I'm sad hot is becoming the norm because I can't eat hot. Plus hot spices gets you a final one way trip to the hospital as it gives you stomach ulcers when you hit 60/70 years old."}
{"text":"We live around the corner from this place, and have to say the walk in special is pretty good, but then any fresh pizza tastes good.

So, unless you are ordering something right out of the oven (the walk in special) avoid this place."}

{"text":"Cardboard-pizza but cheap, though the taste may have slightly improved in recent years... still quite bad. Not sure why they advertise as Ontarios #1 pizza.  A while ago, we drove by this store to happily redeem the promotion for a free slice of pizza when Raptors won and scored over 100 pts... the employees denied knowledge of this promotion so I said no problem just call their headquarters to confirm while showing them my ticket stub since after all, we parked here for a free slice. After wasting much of my time by them discussing this back and forth with each other, they shook their head and said never heard it and nothing they can do, without having calling head office. Would have bought a slice since its cheap but I was just annoyed beyond belief at that point and left to eat Mr Congee.  Skip this location if you want good service."}

{"text":"Quick and fast service. Lots of pizza slices and choices to pick from. The cashier is very friendly and likes to serve customer before anything."}

So we walk in to see only four slices available, all with some sort of pork on it. No cheese pizzas, vegetarian or signature like Mediterranean. Still hours from closing with some patrons looking for a quick dinner. Cashier told us we'd have to wait 30-45 minutes for fresh slices, cooks in the back hadn't even started. Drove away disappointed to another location which had an abundance of pizza."}
{"text":"I wish i can give negative star. The worst service worst pizza and at the end they argued. I walked into get pizza ordered a thin crust cheese pizza they told me its going to be 15 to 20 mins after 45 mins of waiting i get my pizza in thick crust and cheese was not even spread evenly pizza crust seemed half uncooked.  Similar experience happened multiple times with this location."}

{"text":"I have a love and hate relationship with many big chain names - but, I have to admit that I really do like Pizza Pizza. Specifically, I like their '$4.99 medium walk in special'. You can have it either as plain cheese or with pepperoni. It always is tasty - and it's nice to be able to have a freshly made pizza for that cheap price. My only complaint is that you can't call in this special - which I guess is why it's titled 'walk-in special'. It just means you have to order it there - and then wait 15-20 minutes for it to be ready. But, considering that pizza is not entirely the most nutritional food item - it is probably good that I am forced to walk down and order it in person.  Want something cheap and cheerful? Walk in and order your pizza here."}
{"text":"We did a Friday evening pick up. It was a bit busy. Nothing special on the taste. It was as expected. Service was ok. Young kids working there and I'm sure with time they will get better.  We had large pizza and wings box. Wings are really not bad. We also had fries. No ketchup though.  4 of 5 stars simply because the food is as expected and they employ college kids who are willing to work and did a fair (not perfect) Job.  Would I eat here again? Yes."}

As soon as we opened the door, we were greeted by the young man on cash, although he was also helping another customer at that same time, he still made an effort to make eye contact and great us :-) The place looked clean, although go they didn't have too many slices to choose from, they had at least a few of many varieties.  Our pizza took very little time to prepare.  It was made well and the toppings were very generous!  No complaints, so far so good"}

{"text":"REVIEW FOR THE CRISPY CHICKEN WINGS ONLY - made to order comes out piping hot, juicy and tender inside, and crunchy on the outside. Not bad for fast food chicken wings.  If you're in the area, don't mind the pan handlers outside, can stand the drama between the staff (arguing, blaming, etc.) and are planning to take your order to go (tables are dirty don't eat in) then this place is for you.   I would definitely order their chicken wings again if I were at any Pizza Pizza."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I was promised a pizza and panzerotti in 15-20mins, 35 mins later of sitting waiting in the restaurant I finally approach the counter and she shrugs me telling me to wait. She finally comes over with a burnt pizza and tells me I left the restaurant so it's my fault. My girlfriend and I were in the restaurant the whole time. The 2 managers and cashier start yelling at me telling me I shouldn't have left and a pizza takes 30mins+ to make. Had I not called into customer service and rectified it, I would never have ordered from pizza pizza again. I hope the formal complaint I requested was actually filed against this store. You can't badmouth and treat customers this way."}

{"text":"Chain restaurants are a different animal. You go there for consistency, basically. The quality is what it is, and it's always going to be roughly the same at every location.  You can't realistically compare them to anything except other chains serving the same type of cuisine. Even then, Pizza Pizza is probably the worst choice you have. Unfortunately, I was running errands in the area and really needed food.  I walk in, knowing it won't be great or even good, but it's edible and both closer and cheaper than my other options. A poster on the door informs me that they're doing 2 slices for $5; about $3 too much for the taste and quality but not completely abysmal.  I'm looking at the menu inside and seeing no indication of the 2 for $5 combo. I'm vaguely aware they have combos but I don't know what those are, mainly because I respect myself too much to eat here.  The menu - tiny print, poorly designed, unclear wording, not enough images - shows 2 or 3 combos, none of which would be practical for a single person grabbing a bite so they can muster up the energy to deal with the TTC. They're all basically family-sized meals.  I realize at this point that the cashier would probably be able to help me. I tell them that I'm trying to figure out how to order because I'm not entirely clear on what my options are for combos. Their response is to inform me that they have a lot of combos, so it's my choice. This, plus an unrelentingly blank stare, is their entire response.   Look. I understand working a draining and annoying minimum wage service-sector job. I sympathize with you deeply. I really want to rant about how you're helping to facilitate the transfer of money for goods, and you should be treated better than you are and receiving more money than you are.  I want to do this, but you have to give me something to work with. As both a consumer and a human being with finite time, energy, and patience, I can't praise you for not doing your job. You're now being unhelpful and I'm having uncomfortable thoughts, like \"the manager must be really desperate if they're hiring people who don't actually work and won't help me exchange money for food\".  So I manage to order two slices and a drink. They sucked, because they always suck. This time, they had the added benefit of being completely tepid (despite being warmed when I ordered - how?), eaten at a filthy table, and served by someone who makes me question my commitment to social justice. The food wasn't acceptable and the service was actually kind of unbelievable.  Next time, I'll walk the extra 5-10 minutes and go to Tim Horton's. Bless the free market."}
{"text":"Nice place with a really chill set of workers. One of the few Pizza Pizza stores that have halal toppings as well as wings and other stuff! Tip: when you're getting the large pizza combo, you can usually ask them to change the free drinks to dipping sauces! I always do that."}
{"text":"Worst pizza pizza location. Horrible service. One employee wears regular clothes (no uniform) while the other looks miserable. While the pizza is edible, the service and state of the store (never cleaned) makes you want to stay away.   Also the workers are always on their phones, so good luck getting their attention."}
{"text":"I think this location has really friendly service, the pizza is made just the way I ordered it. I use the pizza pizza app to order it ahead of time and go in to pick up for the time I selected, and it's ready right on time. My orders are usually really complicated with a lot of requests and when I get my pizza it's just as described, it tastes even better than other locations! There's always plenty of parking also."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. Located in a strip mall next to various other shops like a chiro massage place and a pub. Place is clean for the most part. There was a water leak on the roof that kept dripping while I waited for our pizza to get done and a unusual gas odor. Lots of choices of to go items from pizzas to calzones. Weirdly enough was that they didn't have free prepackaged condiments such as: Parmesan cheese, dry herbs (oregano, basil, and thyme), or crushed red chili pepper.  It was just in several individual shakers. Interesting topping was organic pepperoni we don't have that in the states."}
{"text":"Called the call center and confirmed about the delivery time for a bd party for kids later the same day !!! Got a phone call 10 mns after to confirm the order as it was to feed over 50 people, reconfirmed the delivery time for 3h30 the same day as the bd party was from 3 to 5. 3h35 the pizzas are not there call the call center AGAIN on hold for 10 mn before beeing told that the order was taken by mistake for the next day !!!! Unbelievable  after 3 confirmation for the time !!! My husbnand had to go get the food from the branch and the kids were only able to eat at 4h30!! It was a disaster half of the kids did not eat the BD cake as we had to clear the location by 5 !!!! This is not acceptable !!!!"}
{"text":"There's got to be a law that after X number of times visiting the Great White North, you have to go to Pizza Pizza at least once and after eight trips to Canada, I finally went to one of the multitude of Pizza Pizza's around downtown TO. Basically, it's a lot like Little Caesar's and likely built around that concept. Pizza is thin crust although it's a bit chewy. Certainly not cracker thin pizza which I can't stand. You get a 'slice' which is actually two slices so one 'slice' can definitely fill you up. Fries are very basic shoestrings and nothing spectacular. They've got wings (who doesn't around here?) although I didn't try them. It's good cheap pizza on a par with LC back in the states. Not a bad thing, but you wouldn't make an excuse to go here instead of a better pizza spot. Now to finally get to Harvey's next."}
{"text":"Worst pizza pizza ever. I asked for a small salad. They charged me for a large one and charged me extra for chicken. I only got most of my money back after I pointed it out. I asked for crispy chicken they gave me grilled chicken. I requested Asian sesame dressing and hey had run out. I said I would eat it here and they packed it to go. It's like he can't hear what I'm saying or something. Anyways the salad was disgustingly overpriced. I usually don't write negative review but this was beyond unacceptable."}
{"text":"Typical pizza pizza.  Efficient...walked in....order...walked out.    Walk in special - Extra large pepperoni pizza $9.99"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Pizza Pizza locations I've been to. It was like 2 in the afternoon and the restaurant was empty. I placed my order and they told me 20 minutes. Why, I don't know. So I find a seat and wait. I notice every table is covered in crumbs, pepper flakes, and used napkins. My eyes fall to the floor which is also disgusting. As I'm waiting the staff are yelling at each other and one guy is randomly breaking into song singing in Hindi. It's cool to have fun at work but these people were taking it to an obnoxious level. Finally my food is ready. The woman hands me my canned beverage with dough-caked hands so I now have a doughy soda can. I open the pizza. It's overcooked and is for all intents and purposes cheese-less. I don't have another 20 minutes to wait so I eat it. One day I'll learn to stick to delivery."}
{"text":"Horrible experience  They must have had some newbies working because I had the worst pizza I have had in my life.   Pizza was undercooked and doughy which is unbelievable since I know for a fact 14 year olds can make better pizzas than that.  Domino's is right down the street so I will NEVER order from this Pizza Pizza again  Disgusting and Amateur"}
{"text":"I have been to this particular location for many years whenever I don't want to make dinner then a walk-in special (or two) is the perfect choice while on the way home.  The space is large & bright but, most importantly, it is kept clean.  The owner is really nice and if you have been waiting around for your pizza longer than you should then he tries to make up for it by throwing in a dipping sauce or two. :-)"}
{"text":"Pizza Pizza is my guilty pleasure when in this part of Canada.  Consistantly decent pizza, late hours, fast delivery and really quite tasty chicken wings make this a go-to when I dont want to go out and 60.00 room service doesnt sound good!  I'd like to try a more local type restaurant, but often they dont accept American Express...and for my expense account, thats a deal breaker!"}
{"text":"As a new additon to the plaza in the past year or so, this location is always busy day or night.  Pizza is yummy and the half moon cheesey bread is worth craving once in awhile. Open late for your convenience."}
{"text":"We had the special, $2 meatball sandwiches.     They weren't too bad.    As for the pizza, well...  Just mediocre."}
{"text":"I once ordered chicken on my pizza and they threw in chunks the size of my first. Best pizza place ever."}
{"text":"Pizza Pizza's slogan is - Hot & Fresh. Well my Meat Lovers tasted more like Cold and Hard. Pizza Pizza generally has decent pizza. Not the best, but not the worst. Their service is - O.K. at best. Where did all the Italian Pizza makers go? There is no longer anything authentic about Pizza and the craft. Pizza now is a - throw anything on a slice, make up a catchy name for it, add some wings, garlic dipping sauce and a large coke and be on your way. Thanks for the $10. Remember the good old days of $2.50 slices? Bring them back! And make sure your Pizza is FRESH!"}
{"text":"This pizza place is just horrible. Woman that works there is rude. Slices are smaller and thinner then regular pizza pizza!!! Please try the one on bloor and islington/ Big difference!"}
{"text":"What else would you expect for a pizza pizza. I ducked in here for a quick bite and the washroom. I thought of rating it 2 because of the bathroom but I gave it a 3. Scary as hell it there. One was out of order so I used the other 1. I am glad I did not have sit down. The seat was broken, I feel for you ladies."}
{"text":"It was my child's birthday and him and his cousins wanted pizza.  Since Pizza Pizza was 1 block away, my wife and I decided we would just walk over and order the 2 large walk-in specials.  We placed our orders at exactly 6pm on September 24, 2016.  We placed 1 large pepperoni and 1 large half pepperoni/half cheese pizza's.  The lady who took the order stated it would be 20 minutes.  We waited until 6:30pm to finally get our pizza's.  Once we received the pizza I opened it just incase to make sure it was correct.  The first pepperoni pizza was absolutely disgusting as it was incorrectly cut as it was sloppy and very unappealing, the pizza was barely round.  I went back to the female order taker and I opened it up and showed her the pizza.  She asked \"what's wrong?\", I responded by \"your serious?\".  She then took it back and said it would be another 20 minutes.  I opened up the second pizza and found that it was all burnt (almost black).  I opened it up to the female order taker and she said \"is it too burnt?\".    Once I complained about my two large pizza's, and the staff was going to remake it.  Two mentally challenged males walked in to the restaurant.  They order drinks and sat down.  The female order taker went to the back where the pizza makers were and started to make fun of them.  I find this absolutely offensive and unacceptable.  First they can't even get an order right, and now they are making fun of people who are challenged.  This is ridiculous, it was the most awkward and unprofessional place I have ever walked into.  I hope you review the security cameras to collaborate my story.  I took pictures of the second attempted pizza's I received from them and regret I didn't take the first attempt to show you as it was disgusting.  I hope this will NEVER happen again as I have a child with disability, NO ONE SHOULD EVER BE MADE FUN OF FOR THEIR DISABILITY!  I complained to Pizza Pizza corporate and they stated that the Regional Manager will contact me.  It's been 2 weeks and nobody has even called, whats the point of even giving feedback and asking if I wanted to be contacted."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had - I didn't receive the correct order and explained to the delivery driver I will call to clarify, he left, which meant I was unable to pay for my order. I called Pizza Pizza head office numerous times to rectify/pay for order which ended up being \"cancelled\" so there was nothing I could do. Only for the delivery driver to call police on me. Police called my phone saying I will be charged with fraud and came to my door knocking abruptly. What the heck is going on here?? For pizza? And all I was trying to do through pizza pizza head office was pay over the phone.  I had no issues with paying as I've been a customer for years, my boyfriend even made an order 2 days ago. To have the police involved is insane!!!   I will not be a customer anymore after the stress I was put through!"}
{"text":"I'm torn on this Pizza Pizza -- on the one hand, I quite enjoy the homogeneous Pizza Pizza 'za and have, over the years, ordered dozens of pies in numerous cities.  Consistently tasty, good whole wheat crust and a real tomato sauce with no crap in it (always ask for the \"Authentic Homestyle\", which is apparently known internally as \"The Good Stuff\"!)  On the other hand, unique to this particular location, their delivery can be... spotty.  Two of four times we've had pizza delivered that was, at some point during transit, juggled vertically.  This, of course, causes toppings to slide, pizza to mush, and the box top to stick to the pizza top.  Nothing we can't fix with a knife... but... but... is it that hard to keep your tasty pizza horizontal for the duration of its journey to our doorstep???  Figure that one out and I'll up you to ****, ya?  Anyway, I know Pizza Pizza isn't the best pizza in the world but, for our location, it's consistently good (if a bit slanted!).  Factor in wide variety available and the regular deals they offer -- in particular the pizza and a movie offer, which rocks! -- and it's hard to justify ordering from anywhere else when you've got a hungry crowd.  Oh, and for the record, best 'za ever is as follows:  Whole wheat, thin crust, four cheese blend, homestyle italian sauce, pineapple, hot banana peppers, italian sausage, chili flakes.  BLISS!"}
{"text":"The workers dont care about your food. Takes very long for the pizza to be made. Horrible service!!!!!!! I rather go down the street to Greenwood location."}
{"text":"Pizza Pizza is still my favorite pizza place, I like the fact that I can order online through the Pizza Pizza app on my phone and pick up my order. The classic is still my top choice.   Love the app, plus I get free dipping sauce or drinks sometimes."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Pizza and for me this particular pizza brings back memories from when I was a kid and my parents bought Pizza Pizza for dinner. The smell of the pizza is what triggers those memories.   I like the staff here they are super friendly and always welcome you with a smile, especially the young lady that works the cash register. The service is what really brings me back. I am on a first name basis with the staff."}
{"text":"I'm tired of all the haters. This is Ontario's pizza. Cheap, reliable, always with a good deal. Don't get the slices here. Order a fresh pie. It's the only way. And when you go, tell them Joey Bats sent you.   Cheddar jalapeño is the new creamy garlic btw.   #sharethemoment"}
{"text":"Pretty bad customer service.. delayed my order and then gave me under cooked pizza.. have no apologies what so ever..."}
{"text":"For fast food pizza ....... this place is awesome.   While other fast food pizza chains have taken an absolute butchering over the years, and some are not even edible now [ Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Johns, what horseshit we have here in the US ] Pizza Pizza has remained remarkably good. I always get just cheese. The cheese is baked to perfection on the pizza, the sauce is delicious, and the crust is full of flavor and baked to perfection.   God I wish Pizza Pizza was here in the States."}
{"text":"Pizza Pizza is a-ok in my books.  Visited this location many a time years ago while intoxicated and needing sustenance.  Their walk in specials are usually really reasonable (around $10 for a medium or large pizza) and for the most part are made fresh.  Not the tastiest pizza I have ever had but it should does hit the spot in a pinch!"}
{"text":"The only reason I ever find myself at THIS Pizza PIzza is because I'm too lazy to walk to Pizza Hut.  The RUDE boys that work there are rude and don't even acknowledge you're at the counter until some rowdy white guy comes in and bangs on the sneeze guard in a drunken stupor.   I also do not care for that smug guy with the stupid sideburns who ignores you for 5 mins then approaches w a leisurely stride.  NO, the customer service isn't great but my biggest gripe is the cheese.  You KNOW that's NOT real cheese.  It tastes like melted Kraft singles....  I LOATHE Kraft singles.    ALSO, I ordered my hawaiian panzerrotti and then the RUDE guy put it in the oven as I punched in my debit code..as soon as it said approved, the RUDE guy had my food in a box ready to go.  I'm like....you warmed it up already??? And he said \"yes\" then paused for a while...then I saw a bead of sweat roll down his forehead.  I heard the tremble in his voice, and I saw the fear in his eyes..cuz he knew that I knew he was a DAMN LIAR.    When I got it home, it was a hawaiian goo brick. Everything inside the panzerotti homogenized to form one pinkish goo. If I wanted pinkish goo for dinner I'd find a pink warthog and ask him to tilt his head forward (chin to chest) then I'd squeegee the slime off the back of his neck and put it between two bread slices. That or I'd puree the warthog with my food processor and put it between two bread slices. Look,either way, NOT appetizing.   As I exited, I tossed my empty coffee cup on top of the overflowing garbage hoping that it would topple the whole thing over like Jenga... yeah, I DO get petty.. and it's not like they even care.... That garbage has never been emptied.  Never been cleant  2 stars.."}
{"text":"For a late night Saturday night eatery after your typical 'shake-a-move' the pizza is OK. I wouldn't eat their pizza when sober.   If I remember correctly, ordered for a Pepperoni slice. It tasted like it was at least couple of hours stale and had a very cardboardy feeling. For a drunk guy, this place rocks. If you are not, stay away!"}
{"text":"This is a very average location. The pizza is not bad most times. I don't eat pizza often but when I crave pizza pizza I come to this location because it's within walk-in distance of my condo. The reviews about this place is not great but they are slight above average in taste and always very clean"}
{"text":"This is a cute, convenient little pizza joint right on Rue de St. Catherine.  Perfect for you late night greasy food craving after a night of hard liquor!  Nothing too memorable though, a common pizza joint."}
{"text":"Can you say 967 11 11!  This chain is one of my favorite late night food stops in this area.  They make decent pizza,  they're super cheap, and it's impossible to forget the number if you're ordering delivery.  I LOVE getting  sweet chili thai sauce on whole wheat dough with mesquite chicken and onions mmmmm"}
{"text":"THE WORST LOCATION EVER!!!! I had a girls night at one of my girlfriends house and decided to order pizza. My girlfriend had to pick our other friend up at the airport and so I was at the house with my 2 year old daughter. As I was ordering pizza around 10pm, we asked for delivery to the door. The pizza came within 40 mins and I get a call from the driver. He refused to bring it to the door. He said he felt that because we were in a townhouse complex and there were no parking he would deliver it to the lot. I explained to him that my daughter is asleep and unable to meet him and I was astonished that he refused to deliver to the door. I was LIVID and disgusted as it would have taken him less than 5mins to deliver to the door. FALSE DELIVERY SERVICE, BAD MANAGEMENT !!!"}
{"text":"Really cheesey! Tey deleted ONE QUARTER of the Wing It Box and NO drop in price. What gives, more coproate greed. Pop up window says this is the special price for this Restaurant! Is this chain wide?"}
{"text":"Since I didn't know what to order, cashier had no patience for me. Sounded mother fuckin uneducated dick. Well, I didn't ask for free pizza. Quality of pizza was not good either compare to other pizza pizza. I'd ask you to get pizza from other chains instead"}
{"text":"We ordered for pickup and the pizza place told us we had ordered from a store a block away, which wasn't true. We went on an escapade to find the other establishment which doesn't exist. Not only were the servers rude, but they didn't remember our order and yelled at us for trying to \"cut the line\" when we were just there to pick up a pre-placed order.  What awful service."}
{"text":"Of all the places to grab pizza, this one's pretty average. Nothing special, nothing bad, just gets the job done and it's open late.   Definitely recommend using the app though. It's a great way to get freebies just for making an order online and it speeds up the process by going in store and just having to pick it up with little to no wait time.   Also don't recommend getting a medium pizza. The crust is always way to thin in the middle of the pizza that each slice falls apart as you try to separate them."}
{"text":"Pizza Pizza is a huge hit and miss. I remember how great this franchise used to be when I was a kid. Getting Pizza Pizza was such a treat with their little plastic table holders between the pizzas to prevent the pizza box from crashing down on the pizza during delivery. Now..pizza pizza just isn't the same. I can't say pizza pizza is my first place of choice but since they have a $4.99 medium special..you can't really go wrong for a cheap bite. The key to ordering at any Pizza Pizza is asking for the pizza to be WELL DONE! This is crucial..or else you will get a very old stale cheese looking pizza doused in sauce. I never order their slices anymore because to me they just don't always look very fresh. I also order New York Style Pepperoni as I find it just makes their pizza better overall.   I gave this location a 3/5 only because I at times have had poor service however the manager there is usually really friendly and great. They have had some rough hires throughout the past 10 years but they have gotten better with service. If only their pizza could stay up to par at all times."}
{"text":"I am updating my review to use my new pizza rating system!  I also have to admit that I have become a convert to Domino's.  Crust Texture: Bread-like; not particularly chewy or crispy. Average-airy.  Crust Flavor: Not cardboard-like. More sweet than salty.  Sauce Flavor: More sweet than savoury, again. You can always opt for the Classic Italian Marinara option, however, which is saltier with more of a  tomato tang and herbal flavour.  Sauce Amount: Average to light. You can, however, request \"easy on the sauce\" or \"heavy on the sauce\", and you can specify if you want sauce on top (wha?)  Cheese Flavour: Not that cheesy - not that salty - kind of just THERE...  unless you get extra or a \"special\" kind like Feta or goat's cheese  Cheese Amount : Average. Never too little - never too much - makes me think they measure.  Topping Quality: AMAZING selection - the widest and freshest out of any fast food pizza delivery chain I've ordered from.  Topping Amount: Average. Tending towards skimpy. Never generous. Unless you get double. Then they quadruple it and it's overkill.  Presentation: Great - they use the little plastic \"tables\" to keep the pizza looking nice and the top of the box up!  Overall Taste: I love me some Pizza Pizza. I really do. To me, they seem to offer the widest delivery coverage in TO as well. I love the extra toppings they offer for free as well."}
{"text":"Oh Pizza Pizza, you have lost my delivery business for sure and most likely my walk-in business as well.  I really don't even like Pizza Pizza's pizza but sometimes it's just convenient. Especially late at night. Especially when you are in the middle of painting and it's pouring rain and you just can't be bothered to go out. That's when I call for delivery.  I placed my order and was told that there was no time promise and it would be there when it was ready. Ok. That's fine. I had a few more walls to get through anyhow. I'm hungry but I'm not going anywhere. I asked them to call and let me know when they were on their way so I could go downstairs and let them in - no buzzer. The guy on the phone said that he would note that on the order.  So away I'm working and my stomach is growling something fierce. I check the clock to see that it's been an hour since I placed my order so I call to see what's up.   I give the guy on the phone my number and he double checks it then informs me that there is no order with that number. WTF?!?!? He offers to replace the order. Ummmm, no. I told him that I'd already waited an hour and I would just go to Wendy's so to forget it. Grrrrrrrrrr. At that point I was already ticked.  About 20-minutes later there is a knock at my door. It's the driver with my order. Apparently the original phone guy input the wrong phone number. So the driver is expecting me to pay him. I asked if that was the same pizza that I'd ordered over an hour before and he said yes. I told him I wasn't paying $25 for cold pizza, sorry. He said ok and left.   Not that I was expecting it for free but really?! A gesture could have been offering it to me for half if not complementary for their screw up. At least that would have ensured me giving them another shot and feeling good that they cared to make the mistake right. But no. Nothing. So I guess the guys back at the shop got to eat my spinach, tomato, mushroom, and onion pizza. Or maybe it went in the trash. Either way, a total waste of my time and their product. Fail."}
{"text":"Average pizza, nothing special but good if youre just craving for pizza and dont have the time to look around, its a good choice.   you wont be pleasantly or unpleasantly surprised by the food. :)"}
{"text":"One of the most terrible ordering experiences in my life. First off, I got a combo for a large pizza with 3 toppings and 3 drinks. When it came to choose the toppings, the older guy serving me kept telling me the meat toppings I picked needed extra charge, which is fine. But when I asked him then could you please tell me which toppings are free? He's like just look on the list it says on there. When I told him it didn't show it on the screen, he kept yelling at me saying just read the screen and walked away.  But it clearly did not show it on the screen, I wish I took a picture of it. He came back and I asked him to please list the ones that are free, and he just said rudely to read the screen and walked away again! Rude!  Finally a younger server came over to help and this server patiently listed all the free meat ingredients which turned out to only be bacon and sausages.........  Which is weird since we used to order a lot from this Pizza Pizza and chicken/ steak were all included in the combo choices.   Anyways back to the horrible service. So I have finally placed my order - large pizza with chipotle steak, zucchini, and onion. And when I have placed my order there was nobody (that has not been served) in front of me. 15 minutes has passed and suddenly the youger server told me \"we are out of zucchini\". FIFTEEN MINUTES later.....you are telling me you are out of zucchini?? In which I answered, \"wait, so you still have not started my pizza?? I have already waited 15 minutes!\" To which he had no answer and made me choose a different topping.   To sum it up, it took a total of THIRTY minutes or more to get my order of ONE large pizza with three toppings according to my receipt. My receipt said 9:12.....I walked out of the door at 9:50 almost 10.  Ridiculous!  If service does not improve, doubt we will be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"I don't care how hungry you are or how cheap you need lunch to be, just walk straight by - avoid this place.   I really like pizza, but this was awful! Tastes like it was seating there for ages, service was bad - hurrying us to make the order even though we were the only ones in line. Even the chicken strips, I was told tasted bad. Oh, and no ketchup for the fries.   Believe me, you'll be better off having a street hot dog."}
{"text":"I admire these people for putting up with some pretty severe bitches.  Not easy dealing with the public, but I was treated great and the quality was good.  Fast courteous service.  I will go back."}
{"text":"When it's on your corner and the only thing serving food at 3am, you tend to become a regular. And as a regulars, you tend to bond with staff. Since the night of the free panzeroti and dipping sauce, I have worshiped the men who work here late nights. In fact, sometimes I come in here without ordering food, just to chat. You guys iz awesome."}
{"text":"I ordered pasta. Little did I know I was going to pay $17 for a microwave dinner!   Disgusting. Worst pasta I have ever ordered in my life.  I find it very misleading that I order pasta and get a microwave dinner."}
{"text":"Just did a simple walk in for a medium pepperoni...wasnt expecting much. A half hour for one slice of cardboard. Threw the rest out, garbage plus same attitude from staff. Should have walked 10 minutes east to King Slice."}
{"text":"Good stuff. Good service. Good deal for slice and a Coke. No complaints.  Never tried the creamy garlic sauce. Also had thin pesto pizza that was perfect. Not heavy at all."}
{"text":"Service could be a little better but if you are craving a pizza in the area, swing by here because the pizza's here are like all Pizza Pizza locations which is not a bad thing. I do like the wide selection of pre-cooked pizza's that you can order by the slice."}
{"text":"So the place is not bad. The food is not bad. Parking is free. Pizza is hot. Service was fast and I didn't have any problems. The only issue I had was that there were a ton of high school and middle school kids during the weekday and they just caused way too much trouble. These kids were not paying attention for when their food was ready so the people working there were trying to yell over all the other annoying kids who were talking too loud. Also, kids were going up every 5 minutes and asking if their order was ready or not. The next time I come, I am getting my pizza to go."}
{"text":"Service is crap. Won't be coming back anymore. I'll go to the other Sheppard location near the Canadian Tire. I ordered my pizza slices and took out my Pizza Pizza card and held it out so that I could swipe it when I was ready. The idiot girl working there put my order in and gave me the total, still holding the Pizza Pizza card out, I paid in cash. I then asked when I could swipe and she said \"OH!!! Why did you tell me you had a card??\"  I replied \"I had it out in front of you the entire time\" Her response \"I can't do anything about it now\"  What an idiot. This girl is just too lazy to do her job correctly. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Came here a couple times because I really like Pizza Pizza pizza. However. For some reason, I just don't like the pizza that they make here. It's not the same as  some of the other Pizza Pizza pizza's. Ha. I love doing that. I think it may be due to the fact that the pizza by the slice here was a little old each time and when they re-heated it, it didn't help."}
{"text":"What I like about Pizza Pizza is the dough. There's a special taste to this dough that distinguishes it from the other pizza chains in Toronto. I mean, Pizza Nova is not the same even though the toppings are similar. The dough is what makes this pizza stand out. You can buy the pizza by the slice here and the slices are actually really big. However, I prefer getting an entire pizza to take back home because it's hot, fresh and delicious. I really like the tomato sauce that they use because it tastes very fresh. Kind of like they had just squished the tomatoes. (Which they didn't btw) but it just makes it seem better that way."}
{"text":"\"Pizza, Pizza.\" Isn't that what Lil' Caesar used to say in those old school Lil Caesar commercials? I can't really remember, but this place is a mixture between Lil' Caesars and Pizza-Ria. You know that cheap pizza that you can get for 5 bucks or whatever and has been sitting there on display for when you are drunk and need something to fill your stomach at 3a.m.  No I was not drunk nor was it 3 a.m, but on every corner, every bus stop every billboard, every commercial there was something about this joint. Even in my hotel room was a card for ordering from them.   I swear I was being brainwashed by the song going \"Pizza Pizza...awww Yummy Yummy,\" from the cheesy commercials.  So one night before work I decided to stop in since it was late and the bright yellow sign reading \"Pizza Pizza, Hot & Fresh, tapped into my psyche and drew me in. So fine I go in, and it was just what I thought it was; a Lil Caesars/Pizza-Ria type joint I needed something to fill me up quick before working so I just got two slices of pizza and bread sticks.  I got one slice of Mediterranean and one veggie. Both were mediocre, however I liked the fact that they used a whole wheat crust for them. Oh and the bread sticks were total crap. I saw a sign that said brushchetta bread and I asked for that and the worker told me that they did not have that. So I opted for regular cheesy bread and she said sure and asked if I wanted dipping sauce and said sure to that too.  I get the food and head to work. On the drive all I can smell is an abundance of garlic and I'm thinking ok maybe they are ok, whole wheat crust, wonderful garlic aroma whatever. So I get to work and open up the food, the pizza was aight, nothing great, I mean it was sitting on display under a heat lamp and then put back into the oven to reheat, nothing will be that tasty in said circumstance.   The so called cheese bread was swimming in this buttery garlic chemical sludge and had a minuscule amount of cheese on top without any dipping sauce. I thought to myself \"What the hell are these?\" I tried to eat 2 but the large amount of buttery stuff discouraged me from doing so.  Overall this is cheap, drunk food pizza too me but I guess T-dot residence actually like it since it's practically everywhere including the airport."}
{"text":"This location has always delivered consistently good pizza. The crust always has a nice crisp and they are very generous with the toppings. We tend to order fairly late... but it's always here within half an hour. Delivery drivers are very professional and polite. My go-to preference is pineapple and bacon crumble, I know 'pineapple' the horror for some, but it's so good. Lol there's something about the sweet and mildly tart pieces of pineapple with salty bacon pieces that just complete a pizza for me. Will continue to be a staple go to for pizza."}
{"text":"they smother the marketplace, but man is this the worst/lowest of the low pizza one can buy...  students don't seem to mind it (young tastebuds not yet formed!). More than anything they have the WORST sauce you can use/buy, incredibly cheap and poor taste.  This corner/location is also sketchy, too much drama with the customers, folks from the neighbourhood (i.e. sketchy meth kids).."}
{"text":"Depressing location with lonely people staying way too long for the free wifi.  Pizza pizza is the worst of all the pizza options in toronto, other than maybe 2 for 1..  drive to IL PAESANO for real pizza."}
{"text":"Yuck. Cheapest ingredients, worst pizza sauce in Ontario.. Maybe north America. I'd walk a few blocks down the street, better options!"}
{"text":"I came here the other day to pick up pizza mostly because I just got my nails done up the street.  The service was ok, most pizza from pizza pizza tastes the same.  The guy taking my order was pretty good.  The not so good...I used the washroom.  Gross.  It was early evening, and someone had puked in the sink.  The toilets were a mess.  It was gross.  G R O S S.    I had already ordered so the damage was done.    Upon picking up, the guy at the cash seemed flustered by the customer in front of me.  They have a ton of promotions but I think it's hard for them if you make changes.    I ordered a full pizza with stuff...I think they can manage to get you slices easily..."}
{"text":"This is a pretty big pizza pizza.  We were in the neighbourhood and feeling rather hungry.  Kiddo is still young, so he doesn't eat a large variety of foods yet, but usually cheese pizza will go down ok.  He's a kid, right?  There was a large amount of seating, and it seemed pretty busy, it was close to dinner time, so a lot of pick up orders were happening.  What's nice about pizza pizza is that you're pretty well guaranteed an experience.  It's not gourmet, but it hits the spot.  There's street parking nearby also.  I wouldn't venture out here for pizza, but if you are in the area, it's pretty ok."}
{"text":"Have ordered here multiple times and almost always have a pleasant experience. Recently tried a gluten free, vegan cheese pizza and it was delicious! The crust was crispy and the cheese was great although it felt like the cheaped out on the amount they put on. All in all I enjoy this location!"}
{"text":"I am giving a bad review because I would love the cooks to speak english. I have ordered from this location a few times, and when they make an error I have tremendous difficulty talking with the cook who made my pizza because his english is so poor. They should change the name of this pizza pizza to \"India Pizza\" because all the employees are indian. And I mean brand new to the country. The manager/owner of this location takes money from the employees if a customer complains about their pizza. I'm pretty sure that is illegal, but the new immigrants/refugees here are not educated enough to call the ministry of labour. This is a sad sad place to work. I feel sorry for the employees, but I am upset they cannot speak english. And they keep putting on the wrong type of sauce and cheese on my pizzas! Why can't the owner/manager just hire high school kids like McDonald's instead? I guess high school kids know about their rights."}
{"text":"Their new cook is amazing. The pizza tastes great. They don't burn it like the last cook. And they make the crust so thin and crispy. They have really improved themselves. And the French fry portions got a little better. Box isn't quite full yet but it's better than before."}
{"text":"Pizza Pizza no longer allows you to include cheese as one of your free toppings!! They charge you an extra dollar. That's ridiculous !! I refuse to pay in principal.It has always included all cheeses . I will look at other places now like Pizza Pino's. I never spent a fortune there but guaranteed to get a large 3-4 times a month. Shame on you."}
{"text":"Garbage. Dont even bother coming here for \"pizza.\" You can tell the slices have been sitting there for hours and dont even look fresh."}
{"text":"Extremely rude employees. Did not want to serve me. They were all talking huddled in a group. Unprofessional. I ask for tomato sauce and they told me to buy dipping sauce. That it was illegal to give me tomato sauce for my pizza??? What the heck!! The girl that works has such an attitude. The whole staff in this place unprofessional and extremely rude. Will not be returning and will not buy pizza pizza. I will not spend my money on poor managed franchise!"}
{"text":"Came here for the $4+tax lunch special, and got my pizza + fries + can of pop. It was a nice amount of calories to keep me energized for a long afternoon, and surprisingly cheaper than your typical burger combos at McDonald's etc."}
{"text":"I'm usually quick to voice my displeasure for Pizza Pizza. I always cringe when it's voted the best pizza in Toronto from various media outlets, but I'm starting to warm up to the location by my house -- mainly out of sheer convenience.  Growing up I used to adore Pizza Pizza -- and to this day I am impressed that everyone knows their phone number off by heart thanks to their legendary jingle -- but when moving to Toronto I quickly realised there are much better 'za options in the city.  Here's the thing: I am super lazy. Sometimes when I'm on my way home and I'm hungry it's hard not to take advantage of this location's walk-in specials. One of them is a medium-sized pepperoni pizza for $5.99! Even though a medium size is what small used to be, this is still a pretty great (and affordable) deal. They also have an option of picking any size pizza (including Extra Large) with three toppings, plus two pops and dipping sauce for $13.99. Hard to resist for a bachelor like myself. You can pop that XL beast in the fridge and cook it up the next day.  The pizza is definitely on the fast food tip. I recommend getting thin crust on anything because their style is very doughy. Avoid whole wheat crust because I got it a few years ago and it tasted like cheap, un-toasted bread. It was so bad that I couldn't even finish my pizza.  This location is right on the corner of Bloor and Brock. They seem to be open around 3am on most evenings. It's a huge space that is usually pretty empty when I get there, but it's nice and clean and the staff are pretty solid. Also, you can order online, which makes the whole process even easier."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible, slices are always rock hard and look as if they've been sitting around collecting mold for a week.  Wilted veggies on top.  Only thing I can possibly imagine anybody ordering is the $4.99 walk-in special"}
{"text":"Incredible how you show up an hour an half before they close and they have ZERO slices available.  They make you order an entire pizza.  Where did service go??????? This is Pizza pizza they're suppose to have pizza slices available for walk in customers.  Went back a second time (don't ask why) got a panzorotti and asked for extra tomato sauce and the guy kept trying to sell me marinara sauce and trying to tell me it's the same as their tomato sauce when I asked again and again for their tomato pizza sauce he then claimed they had no containers. Asked for plastic knife and fork and he said they didn't have any.  These guys are jus surviving on delivery. Walk in business sucks at this joint."}
{"text":"Pizza Pizza is my ultimate late night eats in Toronto, and probably all of Ontario. I have only ever ordered Pizza Pizza when it was either really late or I was in a hurry and had a long drive ahead of me. I stopped in here Sunday night before driving back to Buffalo and got a slice or cheese pizza and an order of French fries to snack on for the ride home. The pizza was exactly what is expected from an 11PM trip here and it did the job for me, the fries were made fresh and pretty alright. Overall, this is just another basic Pizza Pizza location and thanks to it's convenient location down the street from the Battle Arts Academy, I'll probably find myself here again in the future."}
{"text":"My favourite Canadian fast food chain! I came here on Sunday night while in need of a quick bite for the ride back to Buffalo and it was a great idea. I came in around 10:30PM and was in need of a slice of pizza and some chicken wings and that's exactly what I got. The pizza was good for what it was and the wings were crunchy and hot, so also very good. Overall, Pizza Pizza is another typical pizza type chain that might not be for everyone, but it is certainly for me!"}
{"text":"I don't think I can really muster up much to really say about this Pizza Pizza location. I stopped here Sunday night before heading back to Buffalo and I required some food for that drive. They were out of poutine which was the main reason we were there and had to settle for the pizza slices and chicken chunks. The pizza was average for pizza pizza and I will always be a fan of the chicken they use. It has a unique flavour and a nice crunch that I've come to really enjoy over the last decade. Overall, this is just another typical Pizza Pizza location but it will still get you the pizza and chicken you need (just not the poutine)."}
{"text":"Another Destiny Wrestling show, another late night stop at the nearest Pizza Pizza location. I stopped at this location around 11PM on Sunday night ready to have some pizza and wings (Gotta eat something before the drive back to Buffalo) and that's exactly what I did. The place was pretty empty when I got there but since they usually only have one employee at night it took him a few minutes to help me (Not a complaint, the man was busy). I ended up ordering a slice of cheese pizza and an order of the breaded wings (seems to be my go-to order). It took maybe 5-10 minutes to come out and soon enough I was stuffing my face in the parking lot. The pizza was exactly what is to be expected from Pizza Pizza and the wings were hot and pretty darn good. Overall, this is just another average Pizza Pizza location that is ready to serve you."}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles and I loved their pizza!! The cheese pizza tastes amazing after 3am! Lol"}
{"text":"Very spacious spot with a lot of seats and rooms to sit down. Clean and tidy. Variety of Slices are available all the time And pizzas are well made. Need to keep out napkins though! Not too bad of a place but only been here once!"}
{"text":"This place is good just like the other locations. Tidy, clean, and plenty of seats for people to sit down and eat. It gets busy around lunch time and 6pm (dinner time). The only thing I disliked was the lack of employees during such a busy time. There was only one employee working the cash, taking orders, frying stuff, and putting in the slices for customers in the oven!! He definitely needed help especially when people kept coming in. We ended up waiting a couple minutes in line cause he had no help and quite frankly I felt bad for him."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Been here so many times. Very fast, they rarely make mistakes with your orders, and are super nice. Pizza is delicious and the place is organized/neat. Sometimes they do run out of slices so you wait for a specific slice you want but rarely!! Amazing place!!"}
{"text":"This place has no consistency. Burnt! And no olive oil!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for the past 10 years or so and it used to be a great pizza parlour.  With all the new specials, it's really hit or miss. Unfortunately, it's hard to have it both ways getting a great pizza and saving money.  I still go here at least once a week. The pizza is made fresh and only takes about 10-15 minutes. However, the cheese is a little light.  3/5"}
{"text":"This pizza pizza is located at the north east corner of Woodbine and 16th, inside the plaza. I've been coming to this pizza pizza for over a decade. There's ample parking and generally the area is quite busy.  They used to make great pizzas with lots of cheese and toppings but it seems like they're starting to skim a little bit.  The owner also owns a franchise at Bayview and Major Mac, but the fact that I'm getting pizza that doesn't have as much cheese, kind of defeats the purpose of a pizza. Now, I definitely don't blame the staff, because I'm assuming the owner wants to use less cheese and toppings to keep costs down. But considering other chain pizza's are using proper amounts of cheese... I feel like unless you have no other options around you, then go to Pizza Pizza, but Little Caesars has great deals, Dominos has amazing deals as well and their pizza is perfect!  2.5/5"}
{"text":"Whrn you want a slice of pizza for a good price this is your spot. This is a great place to get a lot of pizza as well. If you are looking for quality pizza though, this is not the place for you. Overall, it does the job. I love chicken, bacon, and creamy garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Pepperoni pizza was comparable to most takeouts in the US. Had a variety of cold sodas and drinks in cans and bottles to takeout. Liked the option of a cheaper meal to take back to the hotel.  Cashier spoke English and they took cards as payment - which was nice as we have run out of Canadian cash at the end of our trip! I'd like to try some of the other items on the menu when I come back in the future."}
{"text":"We LOVE Pizza Pizza! Being from the US we've had a lot of delicious pizza, and this is right up there with our favorites. We called around 9:30pm on a Friday night for delivery to our hotel. We ordered a large half cheese/half pepperoni pizza and funnel cake stix for dessert. It was all delivered within 30 minutes and was all delicious!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I recieved a soggy under done pizza today, I was told that this was the best pizza place by my Canadian friend. He called them back for me and they declined to send another because the idiots are so sure about making undercooked pizza is best. We also got wings and pop both were great except for the freaking pizza going to the trash rather than me going over there and slamming the soggy pie on the cook's face. I'm just going elsewhere for my food for now on."}
{"text":"Wouldn't make a pizza 15mins before closing and the employee indicated they were closing in 5mins lol"}
{"text":"Typical \"fast food\" pizza place like Dominoes or Pizza Hut in the States.   I came in because I received a free pizza from a Leafs game the night before.   I had a pepperoni and cheese slice (the only slices that they offered to redeem my pizza).  They do have plenty of different pizzas though; even Hawaiian.   The dough tasted pre-made but all in all the pizza wasn't bad. A nice crunch to the dough. The pepperoni was good."}
{"text":"Cardboard Cardboard  That's at least my interpretation of the flavors from this joint.  It's fairly good value if you get the giant pizza sizes and share with friends or consume for weeks.  Slices are pretty expensive, as almost everything you want to eat seems to be in a higher price category that what you think it will be.  The pizzas are seriously pretty flavorless.  Crust tastes like cardboard.  Sauce is bland.  Some of the toppings are at least OK.  Look for the freshest pizza, some of them have been sitting out for questionably long times.    The staff are generally pretty friendly and it's at least relatively clean.  It's open late if you're desperate.  There's also almost always a friendly homeless person by the door."}
{"text":"Good solid pizza. They are not cheap but taste to price value is pretty high. I also really like their fries and chicken bites. The single slices and lunch specials are pretty good value.  If you are not a pizza fan, they also have pasta and sandwiches."}
{"text":"What a disaster!  I came here because of the Toronto Raptors pizza promotion (free slice of cheese or pepperoni after a win where over 100 points are scored). Clearly, few of those who were chanting \"we want pizza\" have eaten much of this stuff!  why would any corporate entity such as the Raptors want to connect with a place of low quality? I get it that everyone ( myself included) doesn't have loads of cash to eat out all the time. However, the value here does not add up. After eating here, I could totally understand if the Raptors accepted endorsement deals from train station washrooms or adult bookstores. You won't hear me chanting anything about wanting this pizza at the next game!!!  1. I wanted pepperoni, but they didn't have any. I could wait 10 minutes or take cheese. I took cheese. 2. The cheese pizza was heated to lukewarmness. 3. I sat down in the dining room. The dirty wooden chairs were the first thing I noticed (bacteria with no extra charge!) then, I realized there were smudges on the walls and dirty splashes from old mop water everywhere. 4. The service was indifferent at best, and I can probably understand this one. 5. Oh, the pizza? I had to check twice to make sure I wasn't actually eating cardboard."}
{"text":"Ok where do I start????  Many time in 10 years I have been at this location and wow SOME of the employees are great but some are arrogant and rude and need to learn the guarantees Pizza pizza offers...today I ordered online a pizza for pick up at that location... app says 15 minutes or free... so 17 minute Mark hits and I asked the girl at cash if our order is ready yet... she went to the back for about 2 minutes and came back with it... I opened the box to see if the pizza is well done like I had ordered and to my surprise it wasn't.. the cook says I will put it back but you ain't getting it free... I told them the pizza was late how it was and now it's gonna be later... he said I wouldn't get it free and if I had a problem with it call customer service.... so I did... bottom line is I will now pick Pizza Hut in the area before I go back there again... it's a shame how one cook can give a bad rep for the rest of the good STAFF... and trust me the one star is for the good employees there... always have troubles there when that specific cook is in... anywhere from not doing well done... to forgetting toppings.... never again your gonna screw my order up..."}
{"text":"I can't say that I'm a big lover of pizza but I don't dislike it either. I rarely go out of my way to order or eat pizza. This visit was no exception. I was getting home from work late and most of the fast food outlets near home were already closed so dropped in at Pizza Pizza.  They had whole variety of pizza slices on display, reheated to order. They looked good but I still wasn't quite feeling it. I ended up ordering the Classic Chicken Wings (unbattered) to go, 10 wings for 9.75.  They were still hot and crispy when I got home. I had opted for the Creamy Garlic dip but it wasn't really necessary. The chicken had minimal but just enough seasoning. Not bad. I'll try the crispy (battered) version next time."}
{"text":"ordered a heart shaped pizza for my friend's bday over the phone. pepperoni was uncooked and they did not make it halal as requested. I understand that mistakes happen but the cashier was rude and refused to fix it. she told us that it's not their problem and that we should call head office... had to ask to speak to the manager who was much easier to deal with and agreed to correct it. maybe the worst part was that they put the pizza that we took OUT OF THE STORE back into the case for other customers to buy. they have no idea what we could have done to that pizza... I don't think that is very sanitary. spend your money somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Limited delivery area. Can't say quality of food but if they won't deliver it then it can't be that good. Pizzaville delivers to all of Bradford until 1am"}
{"text":"I'm comparing this rating to other Pizza Pizza franchises. Of course it's not going to be the best pizza you've ever had, but the slice that I was served looked like it had been sitting there all day. I was there around 6pm and it didn't look like any of the slices were fresh, especially considering it was dinnertime. Also, I don't expect it to be the height of cleanliness but absolutely none of the tables had been wiped. No napkins available. Needless to say, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I don't care what people say, I love Pizza Pizza pizza. And I learnt it the hard way. When I lived in UK for almost a year, I had the worst cravings for Pizza Pizza. And that's when I knew - I really did love Pizza Pizza.  This particular location is the closest one to my current residence. It's a decent size, the service is good, and they deliver on time. I've never had an issue."}
{"text":"zero stars !! We have ordered from here several times. Once for pick up and other delivery.. each time the pizza was dry barely any toppings on it and the service was terrible. For the price we pay for pizza nowadays its ridiculous we did not even get all the toppings that we requested. The pizza was cardboard. We asked the pepperoni be cooked instead of raw ( as it should be) on a pizza and instead they were confused about how to do this ?  NEVER ordering pizza pizza again. Called their customer service and they wanted to offer us a 6 dollar credit 6 bucks ??? are you kidding me. NO thanks keep your 6 dollars you have lost REPEAT customers. I would get your crap together pizza pizza stop taking advantage or people. I will be writing to head office"}
{"text":"Rude and abusive people, would not recommend you visit this location. My husband visited this location to pickup a pizza ordered earlier. The order was not ready as per the 20 minute guarantee and when reminded about the \"20 minute or its free\" policy, was abused and believe it or not called \"..... a beggar asking for charity\". Pizza Pizza was notified and action has been taken against this franchisee.   Never got to taste the pizza but the customer service and abuse was in bad taste..."}
{"text":"I give this review 4 stars only because as far as fast-food pizza places go, this place is quite decent. It just doesn't compare to dine-in Italian restaurants and pizzerias, but anyone looking at a pizza pizza review should probably already know that.   I have ordered from this location about 5 times. Only ever had a couple complaints.     First the good: Pizza is decent. Lots of customisable options and toppings (including whole wheat, gluten free, thin crust, different cheeses/base sauces etc). Chicken wings are quite good! As are boneless chicken bites. Lots of flavours too- and pretty good value. Fries aren't bad. Servers and delivery men are friendly and personable!   Good value! Can easily feed a family for $50. Delivery takes an hour or less, or it's free. Always comes quite quickly.   Now for my couple complaints: First, the pasta I've tried is barely edible, and arrived cold. It's not the only thing that arrived cold either, it seems the non-pizza items are cooked first and are therefore lukewarm when they arrive (though the pizza is always hot and fresh). The other thing is that they have messed up my order once before. They added peppers to a pizza which I definitely didn't order (the order was placed online so I was able to confirm that the mistake wasn't mine). It ended up not being a big deal - except for the fact that I hate peppers - but if I happened to be allergic it would have been a huge no-no.   All in all, not a bad cheap pizza place!"}
{"text":"We came for a late dinner pick up.  We ordered the advertised special for large pizza, which came with 3 toppings, 10 chicken wings, 4 pops and 2 dipping sauces.    Two notes:  1) any 3-toppings special allows you to choose ANY topping.  You can effectively \"create\" any of the $16 Classic Pizza by ordering the same toppings.  You get a better deal this way. 2) the guy behind the counter tried to \"give us a deal\" on ready made personal sized pizzas.  It turned out he could not punch in less than the minimum price on menu, which was $4.99.  The few premium pizzas were priced at $5.99.  In other words, the deal he can offer is not much of a deal.  Only go for it if you want to save $1."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and the delivery guy said he was the owner. He then refused to give me the pizza I paid for online. I didn't have my card on me because all my visa info is presaved online. He got angry and yelled. Poor guy lost a sale but to be fair I've never been asked to present my card before and I do this pretty regularly. Still no reason to be as rude as he was. As the owner you'd think he'd be better with people. No way he deserves any more business with his attitude."}
{"text":"Horrible place, if your pizza is late (over 40min) the driver throws a hissy fit and gets verbally abusive and I got sworn at by a driver tonight. Never ordering from again."}
{"text":"I love Pizza Pizza in general due to their ability to make ordering so easy. They have the mobile apps that can take order for you and customize to your liking. On top of that the deals are pretty good too.  This review is strictly for the Grand Park location. Through my experience, they are rather quick with their orders. Always on time and staff are polite while serving you. However, the pizza are hit or miss. One day it can be amazing and others the flavors are a little off. I've had an experience where my pizza didn't taste fresh and a little cold on top of that but I've also experience times where I wish I had more.  If this location can provide consistency with the pizza, I would definitely rate it a little higher. I would still recommend to not stray away from pizza pizza since their product are just too good."}
{"text":"Was in a hurry and this place was close so I dropped in for a slice.  But after seeing chili on the menu I decided to give that a try.  I love chili, the hotter the better.... up to a point of course.  This chili was not hot at all, but it was good tasting and filling. I could see ordering it again."}
{"text":"Pizza Pizza seems ok to me. But it's not by any means perfect but u know it's something. Once in a while I'm fine with a fresh pizza from Them.  I have been trying to find other places I haven't yet. So if u want an ok pizza give it a try. It's nothing to write home about but it's not the worst either. Also the prices have seemed to go up quite a bit over the years. One of My favourite pizza place used to be Dante's until it changed to new owners.    Thank you"}
{"text":"Terrible service, Filthy washrooms..  Paid for my order, was told it takes 20 minutes, returned 30 minutes to pickup my order. Gave my receipt to the cashier lady, she walked away without saying anything. Waited patiently for 20 more minutes, asked for my order, the lady asked for my receipt. After telling her that she took it and telling them what my order was, they told me it had been ready for a while... Well, I'm never going back to any Pizza Pizza. Is not the first time I've had a bad experience at pizza pizza(s)."}
{"text":"There pizza is ok in a convenient area . Although some times . The place gets some  inconsiderate costumers . Overall the staff are welcoming pizza is fresh would recommend this place to come to have a slice of pizza"}
{"text":"fabulous LARGE fries, generous chicken pieces, and delicious pizza. they really mean large fries!!!!!   around closing time (~2:30am) the staff were pretty unwelcoming to us and wanted to be closed already. they were the only food in the area so we ordered anyway and they begrudgingly let us walk past the mat in front of the register to sit and wait for our order to be ready. (but no dine in, even though they were open another 30min). we went to mademoiselle across the street to eat!!   SUCH great FOOD!! customer service could use work, but eh, happy new year!"}
{"text":"Gotta love this place.. they make the pizzas as expected all the time! Also the customer service js good :)"}
{"text":"Come here only out of convenience. They're as quick as any other pizza pizza. Quality isn't as great as others. Look at this attempt at a bruschetta pizza."}
{"text":"Got food posioning here, do not buy! Plus they have pepperoni pizza slices on display separated from other pepperoni pizza slices labelled \"Special $5.00\". Also the crust was separating from the flour on the crust on the \"special\"."}
{"text":"I hate how small the place is and its uncomfortable to sit on high chairs. The pizza was so gross. Greasy and wayy too cheesey. I swear after eating just the half of the first slice of pizza I became sick to my stomach. I was super hungry too....and the pizza really threw off my appetite."}
{"text":"Absolute worst place to order pizza. The kitchen is ran like an absolute circus, no one has a clue what customer service means. The angry workers there yell at you when you complain that your pizza is 40 minutes late. I would not dine-in or order here ever again"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever ! I don't understand why there isn't any accountability in this company !"}
{"text":"This place hit the spot!  I was tired after 4 days in a row w/ just 2-3 hours of sleep, I had a 5 hour flight ahead of me, and I was hungry.  Pizza it is......Got a slice of cheese pizza, some fries, and a bottle of water (w/ a side of ranch and ketchup).  mmmmmm mmmmmm!!! that was off the hook!  the fourth star is because they're a fast food pizza joint that has fries too!  Hit the spot.....I should've got a whole pizza and just brought it on the plane w/ a bag of fries.....now I know for next time."}
{"text":"Mamas pizza is way better! The pizza is nothing special and there are WAY more pizza joints in the city I'd rather go to before this place. They do have really good wings tho (even tho they call this a pizza place). If you're looking for some deals than this pizza joint is the right spot for you. If you're looking for QUALITY than this isn't the spot for you!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm rating this place a 4, but I left here feeling very satisfied, at least in terms of their chicken bites.  I won't speak in terms of their pizza as I didn't order them here. However their chicken bites are made fresh, only to be fried and baked after you order. Therefore it will be a bit of a wait, however I can tell you it was well worth it. The blue cheese sauce I added on top of that was even better, especially since it cools down the hot bites after you initially bite on them.  Located at the corner of Danforth and Woodbine, this Pizza Pizza is easily accessible by subway. A busy area too I find, and they do have good business, considering I arrived at around 3:30pm."}
{"text":"Solid three stars. The pizza slices suck/are dry (as with most Pizza Pizzas), but I recently tried a calzone there, and was pleasantly surprised. The dough was nice and crispy, there was enough sauce and cheese, and the toppings (deluxe) put it over the top.  Basically, come here for the calzones only!"}
{"text":"I like that they have a variety of pizza slices - some have chicken, and one is even made with whole wheat crust.  The concept is simple - you order your slice and they slide it in to the giant oven to heat it up.  What I can't understand is how they manage to screw that up.  Sometimes they leave it in for 4 or 5 minutes and it comes out hot, and sometimes they leave it in for 2 minutes and it comes out slightly warm, without the cheese all melted.    On a completely different note, there is an upstairs seating area here.  It is the most plain and sterile looking 'restaurant' I've ever seen, and it is always very quiet, because they don't play any music.  Once I went up there and saw a girl sleeping on a table. For a while I thought she might be dead, but then, half-way through my pizza, she woke up and went back to reading her book."}
{"text":"Needed a quick and affordable snack in-between breakfast but right before a wedding dinner. Pizza Pizza wasn't bad at all - large slices and not too greasy.  We got two \"flavors\" of pizzas: Philly Cheese Steak and Canadian Bacon with Pineapple.   Philly cheese steak had slices of raw red onions and beef steak on top of mozzarella and marinara sauce. Pretty delicious. So was the Canadian Bacon with Pineapple...pretty standard. Of course the best part was the garlic aioli like sauce. On top of the pizza, it packed a punch of additional flavor."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!! The cashier has effing attitude! Screaming at the clients when talking to them."}
{"text":"As a rule I'm not a big fan of Pizza Pizza but this place has a decent variety of good slices and panzerottis as well as efficient, mostly friendly service.  Price is same as most other pizza joints in area.  Nice new location with small clean dining area.  Same issue as all other Pizza Pizza's, why, why, why do you make the crust so thick?  The corporation recipe makers really need to visit New York City to learn how to make pizza crust!"}
{"text":"Key Features: Change the base sauce, and look for the free toppings.  Sometimes it's hard to get what you want from Pizza Pizza, when you order in person.  I recommend doing it over the website, because that way when they're annoyed with your order, they'll simply call you up and try to whinge about how they can't possibly deliver what they've allowed you to order.  Hold your ground - end up with the perfect pizza.  Pizza of the moment: 2 Medium Pizzas ($25.00 after delivery)  Medium No tomato sauce, extra garlic sauce as the base. Double cheese Chicken 4x BBQ sauce on top.  Medium  No tomato sauce, extra garlic sauce as the base. BBQ Steak Broccoli 4x BBQ sauce on top.  Now - they might try to say that you can't possibly have that much BBQ sauce, but then they shouldn't let you order it on the \"Free item\" list, should they?  No - indeed they should not.  They've tried to say it was an exploit - because in theory, you could keep adding Free BBQ on top infinitely, but when they redesigned to flash, they created a drop down - which still allowed the selection of 4x BBQ.    It should be noticed that if you choose it, and they don't deliver on what you want, you can call up, complain, and will be given coupons for free pizzas in the future.  Some call it petty - but when I want the best pizza money can buy, I know what I want.  And I want it now.  (well, in 40 minutes or less, anyway.)"}
{"text":"There's one thing to recognize straight off the bat (pun?):  If you're there during Baseball season, and it's an hour or two before the game - prepare to wait.  Prepare to have the servers not take ten minutes to help you through your slice selection, while the line is growing out the door.  If you come in with that understanding you'll do fine.  This location is highly trafficked, and on Monday, if the Jays threw 7Ks on the previous Friday or Sunday (or the perfect storm of both) just stay away.  It's not worth it - unless you know what you're getting into.  That being said, the staff are incredibly polite and capable for what they have to put up with.  This is not a run of the mill location - this is where all the post game drunks looking to sop up their $10.00 beers come for cheap eats.  But it's pizza.  And it's as good as a number of other locations.  Just don't expect to be pampered when there's a giant queue to get through."}
{"text":"One hot summer's day, I was starving, far from home, and only had a tonnie toonie and a loonie in my broke-ass pocket. So I walked into Pizza Pizza and got a calzone calzone.  Now, I usually love calzones, enough to overlook even horrible ones. Not this one.  The center was ice cold. The pepperoni was slimy.  It was solely enough sustenance to get me back home, and I promptly threw up. Barf barf. Maybe that's why it's called Pizza Pizza - I definitely saw my calzone twice.   Thanks, Pizza Pizza. You were gross gross."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza with half green olives half banana peppers. Guy had us check the screen to verify. Waited 20 minutes and pizza was still made wrong. If you want a pizza just go to another nearest pizza pizza because what a waste of Time"}
{"text":"this has to be the worst pizza i've ever had. DO NOT order a pre made slice it will be burnt and stale."}
{"text":"What they lack in quality they make up in size. 5$ lunch combo for the hangover greasy cure."}
{"text":"I don't order Pizza Pizza very often, but when I do, this location is always a good bet. We ordered online and it was a quick and easy process.   The staff at this location are always friendly and do their best to make sure your items are correct.   The only drawback to Pizza Pizza in general, is that the pizzas are ALWAYS lightly done, which some may like, it's just not my preference. We ordered two large pizzas, both two topping, and the total came out to $30. A tad bit pricey compared to other pizza restaurants in the area.   We decided to try out their new Dairy Free Cheese Option on one of the pizzas and unfortunately it was just okkk. The Dairy Free Cheese did not melt all the way, even when we put it in the toaster oven at home. It also had such a gooey consistency, that it kind of stuck to the roof of your mouth.  Props to Pizza Pizza for including a Dairy Free Cheese option on their menu though!"}
{"text":"Love their crispy chicken wings. Waited for 10 minutes as they cook it as you order. It came hot, fresh and super crispy. Wing portion is average. We love dipping it on creamy garlic sauce.  Place is ok. Staff are always nice."}
{"text":"This is where I go when I want a pizza/a quick bite to eat. Prices are definitely better than pizzaiolo which is way pricier. The pizza here is ok, nothing amazing. Maybe 3 stars. One thing I would like to point out is that the staff in this location is very dishonest. Whenever they have a promotion, for example when they give you a Cineplex two-for-one coupon, they always cheat you! It has happened several times - too many for this to be just a coincidence. They give you the pizza and whatever else you might have ordered, but conveniently enough they ALWAYS seem to forget the coupon. Every time I had to check and then go back and ask for the coupon. For this reason this location at Yonge and Eglinton  gets 1 star only."}
{"text":"I had the signature pizza combo with vegetable and jalapeño cheddar Cheetos. Overall good experience trying a Canadian chain though the pizza was a bit stale. Service was good, they let me use their outlet behind the counter. Stopped by on my way to queen street windowshopping"}
{"text":"This USED to be my go to Pizza Pizza location. I've been coming here for over 10 years.   I ordered my regular order over the phone so I could pick it up and leave instead of waiting around for it to be made. (2 large pizzas, 6 cans of pop and 2 dipping sauces for around $29).  The employees were nice up until I noticed that unfortunately one of my pizzas had the wrong toppings. I knew it wasn't their fault, the person I spoke with over the phone must have wrote down the wrong toppings. I called back and had them send the correct order. The first two pizzas were ready within 10 minutes, but the pizza they had to remake took 35 minutes. The cashier didn't ask which pop I wanted and gave me 6 cans of coke, I kindly asked to switch 4 of the cans to Fanta, it would've been nice if he didn't roll his eyes and give me so much attitude while switching the pops for me...   While waiting for the pizza, I couldn't help but notice how dirty the tables were, it only takes a couple minutes to wipe the tables, especially since it wasn't busy at all. There was trash on the floor surrounding the garbage can, and newspapers scattered all across the counter.   Not only did the pizza take 35 minutes, but they made me a medium instead of a large. Too bad I noticed once I got home. They also made the crust around the pizza very thick and wide, way too much crust, not enough base and toppings. Not happy about that at all. They also charged me $1 extra for a topping I didn't even order. Very frustrating.   I will NOT be returning to this location. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest place I've seen. No hairnets to cover there hair. No plastic gloves for hands. Asked for a slice they put it in the oven and two minutes later out it came warm not hot. No conversation he put it in a bag and walked away"}
{"text":"Whenever I had a pizza craving, I would call Pizza Pizza. I think it had a lot to do with their \"9-6-7-11-11 call Pizza Pizza....\" jingle; although it made my ears bleed, I would always remember their number. The pizza was always satisfying, until I moved to this location's service area. Dry; would be the best way to describe the situation. No one wants to bite into a pizza, anticipating its delicious juicy flavours, and taste sand. People's  right to delicious pizza should never be tampered with, and these people are tampering.  Service? It depends on if they like you or not. Liked: Fast friendly service. Not liked: Slow unfriendly service with a pinch of annoyance. Luckily, there are two other pizza options just around the corner."}
{"text":"I figured I would give pizza pizza another chance given the anniversary deal today. This store was absolutely filthy. There were literally flies all over.  The cashier failed to inform me that I would have to wait 30-40 minutes for 3 slices of pizza?! There were maybe 4 customers ahead of me who had ordered a slice and traffic was moderate at best.   The cashier was putting all the slices in a paper bag in the back before bringing them out which I thought was odd. I realized why when I took my slice out upon arriving home. It was only half covered in cheese and burnt. The cashier was refusing cold cans to all customers and insisted that customers were only allowed warm coca cola cans. (although the fridge was stocked) I requested another coca cola canned product as per the promotion today and was refused.   I will be telling friends and family about this horrible experience and never visiting pizza pizza again."}
{"text":"There pizza used to be really good, now its disgusting. Always burnt and tastes liked cardboard. I gave them two more chances and every-time I'm disappointed. I was a supporter but now I wouldn't go back in a million years. Literally eating cardboard, big waste of money."}
{"text":"Fine dining at its finest! If you're looking for the best, look no further!!! Lots of choices and they deliver!"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bit shortly after lunch..  Pizza case was packed with pizza that looked hours old. Ordered a Slice and asked if they had parm cheese. Got a curt \"no\" and was ignored. Every table was dirty and two employees just standing around behind the counter. Gross."}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service imaginable! Out of all the pizza pizzas I've been to this is by far the worst.  I came in here with my Jays ticket, to get my free slice of pizza since they had gotten 7 strikeouts. They tried to refuse me a cheese slice saying it didn't look like the other ticket they had just received. Despite it saying the same date, and where my seat was. There are a bazillion different looks to the Jays tickets. Sometimes people even have to print them out at home! He said I was \"only giving him half a ticket\", and it wasn't the whole one. Honestly I don't appreciate being treated like someone who is scamming pizza pizza for a free slice of Pizza. I don't even like Pizza Pizza! But it was a convenient lunch for me on a Monday... I have now gone back to work angry and pissed off. While I was standing there eating my cheese slice (because all four seats in the place were taken), the same guy got into it with a kid who was complaining there was onions on his cheese slice. He blew the kid off, and the kid threw what was left of his slice in the garbage and stormed out.  This place is terrible. Stay away. I will never go back here even with my Jays tickets for a free slice, let alone buy pizza."}
{"text":"When my fiance and his cousin planned the itinerary for our Toronto trip (the cousin is from Toronto, and my fiance visited his grandmother and cousin there regularly as a child, so I left the planning to them), I was very surprised to see that one restaurant had such low reviews compared to the other places they suggested.  Pizza Pizza is not a restaurant you go to because it's the best pizza you've ever had. You go there because it's convenient, with long hours, a large variety of toppings, and inexpensive. Good for groups with different tastes, since everyone can get exactly what they want on their individual slice.  The service here was pretty deplorable- they were out of Hawaiian pizza, which 3 of 4 of us wanted, and they were extremely resistant to making a fresh pizza. After pressing the employee and asking if they were closing soon (the answer was no), he agreed to make another pizza if 3 of us purchased slices of it. He also forgot to ring up my drink, so I had to do two separate transactions.   The pizza is fine- not the best I've had but definitely not the worst, and the boys had such pleasant memories eating here in their youth that it was definitely a worthy stop. Also, free wi-fi."}
{"text":"Went there with my son.  Got the large pizza movie special with 3 pop and movie. The place was clean but small. When purchasing I asked if there was a special for two pizzas I was told no. Even though there was a special.  Not sure if he did not know or forgot about the two medium pizza specials with 6 coke and two dipping sauces.   Service: Was good minus the fact that he did not know about the two pizza deal special. I also had to ask for the movie coupon after I had purchased the pizza.    Quality: The pizza was good a little too much such for my taste but good.   Speed: Pizza was made in less than 10 minutes which is very good for a pizza restaurant.   Overall: Food was good, service was acceptable minus forgetting some specials and coupons. They were also fast."}
{"text":"I love this place because they serve gluten free pizza, and that's pretty darned progressive. If you're gluten intolerant, pizza, sandwiches, pancakes are donuts are probably on your killer temptation list.   Besides getting to indulge in pizza once more, it also allows GF people to have normal nights in with friends, and not have to be the \"high maintenance\" picky eater.  Lastly, GF ingredients tend to be more expensive, so it's cool that PP takes a hit on margin by serving this.  It's not the most amazing pizza I've ever tasted, but it's pizza.  Go Pizza Pizza!"}
{"text":"Shout out to @PizzaPizzaLtd for RUINING a surprise party because they forgot to make the 5 party size pizzas that I ordered 48 hours ago. He manager said... Sorry we were busy. But we ordered days in advanced so we wouldn't have this problem."}
{"text":"On a Saturday afternoon and there was only one guy?  I had to wait a good ten minutes before I can order. That's not acceptable for any standard."}
{"text":"Pizza pizza used to offer 30 mins or it was free. Now it's 40 minutes or they'll lie to you and say they were in your lobby when you were there waiting for them. Cheap ass delivery drivers, better to support companies that employ Canadians anyway.  The dominos on niagara is much better. Full disclosure, I'm not affiliated with either but I was so disappointed with pizza pizza tonight I thought I'd complain on here. They shouldn't be able to offer a guarantee if they're not going to stand by it."}
{"text":"I went to the store 471 yonge st  across the Marriott hotel  and ordered 2  slices.paid $6.50 cash.  The young guy gave me one slice which normally  fits into the paper tray. I noticed that he cut 1 slice in 2 parts making it look like it was 2 slice.  Note : this is now a tiny ridiculously slice now at $3.25 each. This shouldn't happen.         One word of advice to the young teller.  Be honest to your customer .  If you short change anyone, people know.  If I pay for 2 slices, I need to receive 2. Not 1.  This occurred at around 4:40 pm. 2-23-18"}
{"text":"This is the closest Pizza Pizza to my hood so i tend to pop to get a slice or two for the kids.  Evertime i go there the slices they have on display look terrible.  Like the location doesnt give a eff about presentation.  I always ask them if they have any new slices being cooked but they always say NO because they want to get rid of their display stuff firat understandable but i dont think anybody is going to buy that stuff unless its free food. I have ordered online for pick up and its not bad  pizza but going there on for a quick bite i wouldnt even try again.  With that in mind i think i rather geg pizza at a different place or when i do order online pick up at another location.  This place isnt really appealing anymore i hope they get their act together soon."}
{"text":"I was at the Toronto v. Islander game last night. They said bring your ticket to pizza pizza for a free slice of pizza. When we arrived this morning they were BEYOND nasty when we showed them our tickets. \"Were not doing that for tourists plus you'd have to wait 45 minutes because we don't have any single slices\" I'm sorry I've worked in a pizzeria in New York for years and how do you open up without having PLAIN slices ready. So we left, and when we passed by not even five minutes later the showcase was full of pizzas. Can't believe a restaurant could be so rude."}
{"text":"First of all I went there last night 10 minutes to closing hoping to see if I could get a slice but the door was locked I showed the gentleman my watch indicating it was still 10 minutes to closing he had no idea I was going to get a slice maybe I was going to order a pizza however he wouldn't open the door. Tonight my coworker and I decided we would order a pizza. So I went  online to their website and ordered the large special with the three pop. We ordered a simple Pizza pepperoni mushroom pineapple and believe it or not there were only 16 pieces of pineapple on the pizza. Yes I counted it I couldn't believe my eyes. When we went into the restaurant to pick up the pizza, the fellow behind the counter handed me the three pop that came with the pizza and I asked him for a bag. He said we don't have any bags. I was wondering how it was possible that every time I order a pizza from Pizza Pizza near where I live the three pop always come in a plastic bag yet at this particular Pizza Pizza not only do they really skimp on the pineapple but they don't have bags for your pop. All I can say to this is that Im glad I don't live downtown and have to shop at that particular restaurant on a regular basis if I want pizza. What I go back probably not unless I was desperate for something to eat at 2 in the morning and even that being said I would probably just drive over to Yonge Street and find something else that was open. I really hope the Pizza Pizza reads this for their 50th birthday and sees that this is the type of quality customer service that they offer at the Front Street location NOT!!"}
{"text":"Been going to this location for years, especially if raptors finally score over 100 pts and we get to claim a free slice of pizza. I come back because of the customer service, location as well as the pizza. You must be wondering why? They serve the same stuff. True. But at this location of Pizza Pizza, the crust is always crunchy and I won't feel like throwing the crust away. Service is always nice and they always serve everything hot."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place keeps on pulling me back and in the recent weeks has redeemed itself through consistent customer service and completing my order spot on. With the medium box special currently going on for $4.99, you can't go wrong with this price!"}
{"text":"Bad experiences through multiple visits. I'll just be avoiding this location from now on."}
{"text":"Worst pizza pizza place I hate you guys and tommorrow I will make you understand why !!"}
{"text":"Absolute best Pizza Pizza location to wait outside of for a streetcar, if you want sketchy dudes to hassle you for loose change continuously. Or if you enjoy the whimsical sight of watching a grown man pee on a sidewalk!  SUCH a colourful neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"For Pizza Pizza, the pizza is good. On that level, it's exactly what you would expect. And when they run out of ingredients, they use pretty creative and tasty replacements.  This review is really about the bloody awful service. They, for some reason, have hired some of the laziest older ladies to serve. They move incredibly slowly, barely listen to what you're saying and don't bother to remember who has ordered what (even if there are only 3 people waiting for orders). You find yourself repeating yourself.  Recommendation: Order ahead of time so all you have to do is pick something. Or come in drunk ."}
{"text":"My friend came downtown to visit me and as a rather picky eater, she decided she wanted Pizza Pizza. I Yelped the closest one and we hopped on the street car to get some yummy cheesy pizza.  I was a little wary of the terrible reviews but I figured, it's a Pizza Pizza - what can be so wrong? Clearly the two previous reviews are older, especially the first one, and I'm thinking that either this location has been renovated or seriously overhauled.  It's a Pizza Pizza. Anyone who frequents any Pizza Pizza location gets about the same thing every time. This particular restaurant was nice and clean, well-lit and we got decent service. The guy who was serving us washed his hands not once, but twice and my friend had no complaints about her pizza.  If you want a fantastic pizza experience, go elsewhere. There's at least 4 other good pizza joints in the area and you'll get a vastly different experience at those places than at a Pizza Pizza. But if its late and you're hungry and want something fast, Pizza Pizza delivers. Just don't try the poutine; its probably one of the worst (and saltiest) things I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"A regular pizza pizza!  They got those medium pepperoni pizzas for 4.99+tax which is pretty awesome. It's so much better than ordering a $3 slice and having them heat a cold one up.  Never had a problem with the workers thought they're pretty chill guys"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? This location used to be my go to Pizza Pizza location. Right now it's a mess. There is so much disorder. There is one woman there who is very rude to her coworkers. No one knows what is going on. Due to the disorder, I now get my pizza at Domino's."}
{"text":"Toronto is perhaps the only place where I have found halal pepperoni pizza! Excitement!!! Hehe...the pizza was ok not bad, but definitely needed more pepperoni. I'd probably try it out again when I'm back in canada. This place is recommended for kids!"}
{"text":"20mins wait for their advertised walk in special... ordered a cheese pizza.  Lady taking the order was not friendly... and place is freezing to dine in.  Diners that sat... decided to take it to go instead... yikes!"}
{"text":"Solid delivery pie. On par with Pizza Hut and Domino's, without being greasy. Tried a large pizza with one half roma tomatoes and fresh garlic, and the other half pepperoni and extra cheese. The 'traditional' side tasted decent, but the tomatoes and garlic were surprisingly good.  Their policy is delivery within 50 minutes or its free, and my order came in under 25 minutes. Not sure how they managed that sort of speed.  For those who do cold leftovers - it fared quite well, even the next morning."}
{"text":"I love using the pizza pizza app to order from this pizza pizza location....once I order, I usually choose delivery...the app counts down the time to delivery. The pizza always arrives in under 40 mins and is hot and fresh. Can pay debit at the door (small fee with debit)."}
{"text":"I always get the pizza square. It is $1.75 (taxes included). But you have to ask for the square. Almost every location hides them!!! The slice brings more profit."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this location.  I generally stop by for the walk-in special (medium pepperoni is $4.99) and the staff is friendly enough, there is plenty of seating (20 or so seats), the service is quick and efficient, and you can run errands while your pizza is being made (Rexall, Wine Rack, Pusateri's around the corner). Also, if you are not super hungry or on a budget, ask for a pizza square. You can't see them, but they have them and they are $1.75 with tax."}
{"text":"This rating is specifically for this location. The chain itself is acceptable, as others have stated you come here for convenience and cheaper prices.   I come to this location occasionally because it's close to work. EVERYTIME I come, they don't have veggie, which is the only thing I want. They actually don't have a lot of ready made options available. I think it's because the store owner is facing demand and doesn't want a lot of leftovers. I get that, but I come at lunch and they will be opened for the rest of the day, into the evening. Veggie is also a pretty popular choice, so I think that's unacceptable.   Like one reviewer mentioned here previously, they are reluctant to make more pizzas. As I'm sitting in the store eating and writing this review, I see 5-6 more customers request for veggie. Only then did they agree to make a veggie pizza. It's ridiculous though because now everyone needs to wait 15 mins for their pizza, when the expectation was grab and go. People may be getting a freshly made pizza, but it's business hours and everyone is busy trying to get back to work."}
{"text":"I enjoy the occasional $4.99 medium pepperoni pizza offer here.  The pizzas are good, I usually get the Canadian, pepperoni, or Hawaiian.  Tried the panzerottos, not a fan, the filling was too few, felt like eating mostly just dough.  The service at this location was decent and efficient."}
{"text":"It's pizza pizza.  Low end of pizza chains.  Good for what it is but you can tell the ingredients are lower quality than dominos or Pizza Hut.  Pizza nova is even better."}
{"text":"Fast service, good food, what else could you ask For? I actually never had a chance to sit in pizza pizza and eat my pizza there. Last night I went out with a couple friends and with my husband and we ate a whole pizza and it was delish!"}
{"text":"Recently NY had an infestation of bed bugs. Toronto has an infestation of a horrible horrible pizza chain called Pizza Pizza. Frozen pizza warmed up and sitting under a heat lamp is a perfect end to a night of drinking mediocre soju...  We just had to try it didn't we...."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst pizza pizza I've ever been to. The staff is completely rude, I've seen the cook try to fight a customer. Not to mention they charge extra for things like New York style pepperoni, or different based pizzas (e.g. BBQ based) It's the only location that I've been to that does that. While it's a quick fix I would just recommend going to little Caesars, pizza nova, or Pizza Hut a couple minutes away. I don't go to this establishment after I seen the cook try to fight a customer."}
{"text":"I was hungry after getting a few needed items at Shoppers Drug Mart. I decided to check out this Pizza Pizza that was a few doors down.   I have to indicate that I don't eat at this chain these days. It has to do with working extra hours on Saturdays for a month to get a software release out. The folks are work were kind to provide lunch. However, it was the same pizza toppings and fries for four consecutive Saturdays. I have only had food from Pizza Pizza twice since then.  This store is nice. I felt at ease when I first walked in. There are plenty of tables and chairs for you to sit down and eat there.   I ordered a meatball sandwich. I was told that it would take five minutes. I was also asked whether I wanted cheese in it. Yes, please!  It was warm and toasty when I got it. The sandwich was okay. I've had better. The meatballs weren't great. The marinara sauce and cheese couldn't help them.   I'd come back here to try something else. The pizza slices looked good. Perhaps I should have had one of them instead.   (209)"}
{"text":"Nice and simple! Got a large pizza for 10$ and it was ready in 10 minutes for me to pick up. Thought it was fantastic for the price, definitely would order again. Great customer service too, very friendly staff."}
{"text":"This a decent little Pizza Pizza location at Finch & Victoria Park. There isn't too much food in the area but this is one of the options. The good thing is that when you come in & order they get your food done so quickly. This location also has some tables & chairs so you could actually eat here if you wanted to, instead of getting take out. Fast & courteous service."}
{"text":"The worst service here. It used to be better but they have changed their staff. Sometimes on busy days, when we order pizza, they usually don't do it on time. I went in to pick up my free pizza from my raptors tickets and they told me I could only get one because they ran out. I had two tickets and suggested to just get any that was ready but they said they couldn't do it. Even when I offered to pay extra for the second pizza since I had two tickets and I could redeem two. Would not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I'm generally not a Pizza Pizza fan but they are open later than anyone in my area so if I have a \"an after midnight\" craving for Pizza I have basically no choice, but the following story will SHOCK anyone! I ordered pizza pizza a little bit after midnight and the pizza arrived pretty fast, the delivery guy had a problem with the credit machine (not the first time it happens to them) so he said he will drop by tomorrow. At about 2 am I got a call that woke me up that said something about pizza payment, I asked who the hell that was and the answer was \"the guy that is going to come and arrest you now\" I quickly woke up and understood that was the police and they want to come by and \"collect\" the money for the Pizza I REFUSED to pay for! I told them to come by, the pizza delivery guy came accompanied by 2 police cars!!! I got mad at the delivery guy that actually stuck to his story that I didn't want to pay! (probably his boss was super mad at him that he didn't charge me he invented this stupid story). I paid the guy and promised not to eat Pizza after midnight anymore, it will definitely add years to my life :)  STAY AWAY!!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone goes to these places when they are hangering for some sort of fix. These guys fit the bill perfectly. The service is a little quiet as they don't talk much but if you talk to them nicely, they really open up and are very friendly. Not everyone's idea of good customer service but the food is good and I am pretty outgoing so it is all good for me."}
{"text":"I love the Pizza Pizza brand and I love their pizza, but this place is too much for me! So many whiny kids in there misbehaving and crying. Plus, their TVs are kinda messed up. Don't expect me to go back!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them no stars. The rudest staff I have ever dealt with. They screwed up my order and then accused me of lying about what I ordered"}
{"text":"This is the WORST pizza I have ever eaten my life. I went New Years Eve this year as it was one of the few places open in my neighborhood. It was the end of day and the garbage containers in the dining area were overflowing (I know these places can get busy, but at least take the time to clean up the garbage) I found the quality of pizza her LOWER than any other Pizza Pizza location I  have gone to in the past. I should have bought a hotdog from one of the vendors on Blue Jay Way instead. My advice, is if you are craving pizza and this is the only place open or close to you, get a hotdog instead, you can thank me later for this ;o)"}
{"text":"I order online via cellphone from Pizza Pizza regularly. The only thing they don't do well is pasta. For that, you have to order from Pizza Hut. But in every other way, Pizza Pizza has Pizza Hut beat.  Their web site works much faster than Pizza Hut's. They deliver 15 minutes faster than Pizza Hut (admittedly their location is closer). They offer you a freebie every time just for ordering by cellphone. Pizza Hut  (PH) offers you NADA, no matter what you do, AND they're more expensive over all than Pizza Pizza (PP).  PP's soft drink deal, 6 cans, any flavour, any combo, $3.99. PH's crummy deal: 4 cans, must be all same flavour, $3.99. PP wings: 20 wings, 2 dipping sauces $15.99. PH wings: 20 wings, 1 sauce, $17.99. Pizza deals:  PP: 2 medium pizzas, 4 toppings + 6 pops= $16.99. PH: 2 medium 3 topping pizzas  AND NO POP = $22.99.  Now I've done the side by side comparison, why would I ever order from Pizza Hut again, unless to get their chicken fettucine alfredo pasta or a meat lover's or cheese lover's pizza?  Just to make things even worse, Pizza Hut has THE WRONG PHONE NUMBER on their site for Customer Service. And when I got the right one, they cut me off after 5 minutes on hold. I never have those problems with Pizza Pizza. It's 416-967-1111 FOR EVERYTHING. Oh, yeah, one last thing. Pizza Pizza's debit machine lets ME decide the tip. Pizza Hut's debit machine *suggests* I pay 15%, 20% or even 25%! Not bloody likely, you greedy people at Pizza Hut!  You have a lot 'splaining about your prices and attitude before I deal with you again!"}
{"text":"This location should close their doors for good. Ordered three panzarottis tonight one of them had anchovies. That one was supposed to be for me. These guys could not even mark the right product on the box. My boss took a bite out of what he thought was his panzerotti and spit up an anchovy across the room. This could have been a health and safety issue if someone had severe fish allergies. These guys need to start paying attention to what they're doing before the end up killing somebody. Very disappointed I actually wish I could sue them and close their doors before they hurt someone"}
{"text":"It's not good, it's not bad. I ordered a medium pizza with veggies, service was good. The sauce was very bland. Veggies were fresh, crust is average. Best thing is..they're open late night."}
{"text":"Good old pizza pizza. The $5 medium is always a blessing when your feeling marved.   Pepperoni and cheese what more do you need?"}
{"text":"I usually order from this location and I have no complaints. I hardly ever walk in and grab a slice because I find pizza pizza's pizza a bit on the dry side in general. It's free to ask for your pizza to make with extra pizza sauce and 4 cheese blend. It honestly makes a huge difference. I'm also a huge fan of creamy garlic so I definitely will continue to order from them. No one has better dipping sauce"}
{"text":"I have nostalgia when it comes to this Pizza Pizza. We would come here often in the summers when I was a child. It was fun to rip the cardboard box to see if we won a prize. And as an American, someone who didn't know any better, I thought this pizza was great. I still do which is why I give it 5 stars. It's affordable and decent and makes me miss the good times!"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst pizza in Toronto... correction, probably the entire world. Flavourless tomato sauce is directly from a can. If hate could manifest itself as a pizza, this is what it would taste like."}
{"text":"Can't deliver 5min away from it, still have the arrogance to send promotion.  Ils ont le culot d'envoyer des promotions à mon appartement, alors qu'ils ne peuvent même pas desservir mon adresse.  ____________________________________________________________________________  20:52  Jean-Philippe Can I atleast know why the restaurant on Masson Street can't deliver to my address? Pizza Pizza Thank you for following up. We are very sorry however it looks like the address is out of the stores area. Jean-Philippe it's 5min away from the restaurant it's a piss poor excuse Pizza Pizza We understand and apologize. We will forward your feedback and concerns to the appropriate department to ensure this is addressed further. Seen by Pizza Pizza at 21:15 Jean-Philippe And I feel sorry that you have that kind of bullshit job."}
{"text":"Went into grab a quick slice this weekend. Very odd guy working cash. Was a little creepy. Kept staring at me and asking what else I needed. Asked me to stay and eat. I said just make it to go.    When pizza was ready the cook just tossed it at me. It was barely hot. Odd experience"}
{"text":"Located right outside of the Stouffville Go Train Station!! Great place to get a snack after a long day at work."}
{"text":"This location has switched to a new owner since my last review. They can now speak English and cook a pizza a lot better then the previous owners. I actually recommend this location now!"}
{"text":"Now every location of Pizza Pizza deserves 5 stars, but this was loses a star for poor marketing. The food was amazing as ever and enough cannot be said about the creamy garlic dipping sauce, but right when we walked up to the door, we did not know that once we walked up to the counter that we would be disappointed. On the front door was an ad for a $4.99 1 topping pizza. So we felt all good about ourselves and went up to the counter to ask for it. instead, we walked up to the counter and were told that the promotion does not start until october 18th! i'll add that today is october 8th! what the hell! Just give it to us! Anyway, we still ordered pizza and creamy garlic dipping sauces, but never again will we be foiled by a deal that is advertised 2 weeks early!   As they like to say on espn, \"C'mon man!\""}
{"text":"The person working on Thursday was amazing! She was really nice and helpful. She was the same with all customers. We noticed while we waited for our food. Pizza was really good and she came up with alternatives for slices that were not available."}
{"text":"Visiting from USA. Went to this place because the exterior reminded me of little ceasars pizza. The worst customer service experience for my entire trip. When I entered there was only one customer and myself. At this point, I thought it was simple..I ordered a pizza half pep and half cheese. Then in a dismissive tone she said do you want to upgrade..I said no..I'm good..so she said it would be 2o minutes. I left...20 minutes later I returned. once again in a dismissive tone She asks can I help you? I knew it was all down hill from here because the only other person in the store was the customer that ordered the same time with me.  I'm here to pick up my pizza...She goes..what's your order number? Seriously?? The place was empty. I went back to the car to get my receipt..walked in and approached  the counter..the same lady glances at me..and continues a conversation with her co worker for about 3-4 minutes. At this point I was livid..took the pizza and left..but cooler heads prevail..I didn't want to get into an argument in another country. The pizza was mediocre and the customer service was horrific."}
{"text":"It was a late might stop on the way back to the hotel. It was a little slow but the pizza was pretty good. The price was $10 for a large."}
{"text":"Really delicious, but rude customer service"}
{"text":"This place has very friendly staff, nice sitting area if you like to sit down and eat your pizza. This location also has chicken wings and sandwiches and of course salads if your a vegetarian lover.   The location is in a small very quite plaza across from Millikan mills high school so I would think during the school year this location does get very busy, but during summer evening and night seem to be quite.  I highly recommend this place for great tasting pizza and plus they have many specials so it's affordable."}
{"text":"30min later they realized they'd forgotten about me. Poor, frantic service. Luckily, the pizza still hits the spot on a hungry stomach."}
{"text":"This shop should be closed and the deposit not returned.  Poorly run and customer service is non existent.  The male manager returns from his smoke break and does not wash his hands before starting to make his next pizza.  If you want ash and we'll smoked pizza then this is your location. Otherwise keep driving or try the food court downstairs."}
{"text":"Came here for their promotional cheese/ pepperoni slices.  Never have them ready and gives you that.. tough shit attitude.  The manager (blue shirt) is very condescending and stuck up.  He needs to get his head out of his ass and live in reality. The other staff are just as rude as they all give the customer upsells.  Stay away and save your frustration by going somewhere else"}
{"text":"Truely a 3.5 star shop!  Very big shop with plenty of free street parking up front.   The staff here are very friendly and accommodating to special requests within reason.  They run a tight ship here and I find the service here quicker than your average pizza pizza elsewhere. No true store only specials but if you ask they may be v able to do a little extra with the friendly crew.    Too bad the coffee shop that was across closed up shop or it would have been perfect with a nice coffee with a freshly made pie.  Will be visiting again shortly when the cravings return"}
{"text":"The pizza is average. The star rating is for the owner, who is consistently yelling at her staff for the most mediocre things. Missing a few cents, something she didn't agree with. Constantly talking down to them. Had to actually tell her one day she was being inappropriate and that the restaurant could hear her. Awful. If I were a franchise owner I would be revoking her access to the Pizza Pizza name."}
{"text":"Aucune livraison - inacceptable !  Ce qui aurait pu être un excellent dîner du samedi entre collègues n'a été qu'une perte de temps énorme et stupide. Et oui, PIZZA PIZZA « Avez-vous goûté à nos nouvelles garnitures  ? »  NON ! PARCE QUE VOUS NE LES LIVREZ PAS LORSQU'ON COMMANDE.  Samedi le 11 août 2012, je passe une commande pour 3 personnes : 3 pizzas extra-larges, 3 sortes différents, 6 trempettes, 1 boîte de rondelles d'oignons. Total 70 $. Heure : 12h30 pm. Lieu ETS-Montréal. Le téléphoniste me confirme que la commande arrive dans 40 minutes. Ils connaissent l'adresse et j'indique que j'attends le livreur dans le hall d'entrée.  À 14h10, aucune livraison. Le service à la clientèle m'indique que la commande est maintenant gratuite et qu'elle arrive sans faute. La livraison n'a jamais été faite. Lorsqu'on rappelle au service à la clientèle, le système raccroche.  Conclusion : PIZZA PIZZA ne désire plus faire de livraison et crache tout simplement sur sa clientèle. Conséquence : c'est terminé pour les achats chez PIZZA PIZZA.   No delivery - unacceptable !  What would have been an excellent Saturday diner was only a huge loss of time and stupid. Yes, PIZZA PIZZA, \"Have you tried our new pizza toppings ? \" NO ! BECAUSE YOU DO NOT DELIVER WHEN WE ORDER.  Saturday august 11, 2012, I order for 3 : 3 extra-large pizzas, 3 different types, 6 dipping sauces, 1 onion rings box. Total : 70 $. Time : 12h30 pm. Place : ETS-Montreal. The receptionist tells me the order will be there in 40 minutes. They know where to deliver and I say I'll be in the hall.  At 14h10, no delivery. The customer service says the delivery is now free and it is coming soon, not to worry. Food never delivered. Every time I call customer service, it hangs up.  Conclusion : PIZZA PIZZA doesn't want to deliver anymore and clearly spits on the customers. Consequence : orders are over at PIZZA PIZZA."}
{"text":"6 dollars for 2 pepperoni slices, amd they are large. Cut in half, it's more like 4 slices. Hard to beat that deal. Even better, the quality is not cheap. Soft golden, fluffy crust, and not stingy on the toppings."}
{"text":"Pizza is good. There are several options on the menu. The online ordering system is really easy to navigate. There's also a way to accumulate points and get money off future orders. Prices are also fairly reasonable. Delivery time is always guaranteed or else the order is free.   The best thing about their menu is their gluten-free pizza with is convenient for those with allergies. The dough tastes good and you have the option to take the cheese off. Overall, decent pizza that's pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Well this is a Pizza Pizza, what more do you want? Just like any other Pizza Pizza they have pizza by the slice that generally looks unappetizing at best, it's full of drunk people late at night, and the staff all look like thy hate their jobs."}
{"text":"I was hungry at 1:30am .... this place did the trick. ... fast food pizza type of place. You know what to expect!"}
{"text":"Great friendly staff! Really small store with minimum seating area. Great for takeout.   The slices here is large and with really thick crust. Perfect if you have craving for carbs. $5/2 slices.   Great for a quick lunch option."}
{"text":"Pit stop on our way up north - absolutely terrible service!!! It was late night, I assume the guy was the owner - he was so rude and kept rolling our eyes, rushing us to order as we were looking at the menu (even though no one was in the store!) Snarky comments, I've never been treated so poorly! Absolutely ridiculous for a pizza pizza, head office should audit this place! Do NOT go here!!!"}
{"text":"Walk down the street to Mamma's Pizza. ....I'm not one to give a poor review, but I feel compelled to for this Pizza Pizza franchise. I live in the same building- so it is super convenient, however after you order they don't give you your order or give you half the product, and force you to fight with them to get what you want. You will waste your money and time going here."}
{"text":"We came here for our usual large box of wedges, & left without them offering ketchup. Had to walk back to ask for some ketchup (only gave 2 packets, like most locations). They couldn't provide us with a bag, so we left with our wedges in a brown paper-bag meant to fit only Pizza slice.   The wedges box was half filled, had to carry it in a paper bag & only two ketchup packets. A Pizza Pizza experience that was nothing special."}
{"text":"Came here the other night solely for a large box of wedges. The place was empty at 9pm. So we didn't have to wait for much as he fried our wedges up instantly all while watching his show.   HE HOOKED US UP.  Overfilled wedges box & more packets of ketchup then we ever get at other locations.   Best Pizza Pizza experience as we got more bang for our buck."}
{"text":"By far the worst pizza in Toronto.   The pizza tastes like melted crayons on cardboard.   Do the owners even like pizza? That should be a prerequisite in order to own a franchise.   Yuck....."}
{"text":"I used to know someone who worked there - and when I walked in for the five dollar medium pizza take out deal I got a pretty nice pizza.  And their French fries are good.  BUT - DON'T EVER order pizza there late at night (esp. on the weekend).  They serve dirty cardboard that they pass off as pizza to the drunks that crowd in there on Thur, Fri, and Sat nights after midnight.  I got probably the WORST PIZZA I've ever had from that place late one night.  And I had to fight the crowds for the 'privilege.'  I'll repeat myself because words can't describe the pizza that was thinner than any slice I've ever had in my life.  It WAS cardboard.  Flavorless.  Cold.  Stale.  Junk.  But the drunks that cram that place at that hour don't have the sense to go back and complain.  (Update:  I want to thank the owner or manager for sending me a note about my review.  Nothing spectacular in his reply - and it would have been nice if he suggested I come in and he try to make me a good pizza (that I'd pay for - or course) - but it was nice that his email didn't try to deny my experience or make excuses.  Just a simple acknowledgement of my experience.)"}
{"text":"I live near by, not usually my go to place for pizza, but its decent, not the cheapest pizza around but their toppings are always plentiful and fresh. Delivery is on time and the fact i usually get free drinks with my order i'm a happy camper. Food is good for fast food, don't expect gourmet special pizza, its just pizza."}
{"text":"They don't clean the tables, garbage on top. Got my order wrong twice. Didn't give me my 3 pops with a medium pizza. I ask for them he gave me two. I read the receipt went back to get the third. Then when the pizza arrived they gave me one dipping sauce even though I ordered two. They really don't care for your business. If I could give them 0 stars they deserve it."}
{"text":"I think my pizza visited a crematorium before being given to me  lol love a hard crunchy pizza with no taste bar charcoal"}
{"text":"Sometimes when the craving hits  Pizza Pizza is a decent place to get a hot slice of pepperoni pizza.   Its small and best to do takeout from here. Service is alright . I usually order pizza slices that I see have  just come out of the oven and about to be cut.  They have a really good movie deal where you purchase a pizza and get free toppings and a movie coupon. These are the best deals since  you enjoy food and can  enjoy a movie deal."}
{"text":"I ordered an express pick up 1 topping extra large pizza. It was guaranteed in 15 minutes. I arrived inside within the guaranteed 15 minutes. I was told it would be a couple minutes. I showed the attendant my pizza pizza phone app letting them know it would be free if I did not receive it in a minute. The attendant went to the back to talk to another attendant. They quickly came out and handed me a pizza, But it was the wrong pizza. I let them know and they said we are sorry, we will make you a new one. While baking the new one the attendant told me the original pizza was  ready in 15 minutes and I would have to pay for the new one. I was shocked and told them that the pizza was not ready when I arrived, and that they gave me the wrong one. They argued with me, so I left the store. I contacted the call center and I was offered my original order free of charge. I ordered at another store cause I was worried these guys would harm my food.  I suggest you go to another location. The staff working here are not clean or professional. I was grossed out when I saw one of the overweight attendant with dirty fingernails (dirt built up underneath)"}
{"text":"If I were to rank every pizza place in the city of Toronto, Pizza Pizza would rank very last."}
{"text":"worse pizza ever at 826 Yonge St unfriendly service the place was filthy  and so was the women behind the counter she came around and cleaned the tables and reeked of foul body odour pizza was cold and tasteless  burnt on the bottom  i got sick after eating it!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 1998 and have always had great service especially thanks to Mark. He is the main reason I come to this location over and over a very sincere hard-working and polite. This is a great location overall in a plaza with a lot of other convenient stores. Hi Mark, if you're reading this."}
{"text":"Well, what can you say about a Pizza Pizza outlet that hasn't been said about every other outlet in Ontario? Quality is the same as you'd expect to find at any other location - nothing to write home about, but acceptable. Value for money is similarly decent - you won't break the bank eating here. This location does have a lot of seating - three or four 4-person tables hidden off to the left, and about 6 4-person tables in the main area. I've seen it busy, but I don't think I've ever seen it full. Parking lot is a little on the weird side, but manageable.  One thing I cannot comprehend about this location is the service. It's incredibly variable - on a a few occasions, we've had very quick and efficient service, but the normal crew follows management practices that defy logic. Often times, one guy will be taking orders and filling them as he takes them. This is a problem when several of our guys want fries or wedges, and he has to walk back and put them in the fryer for each order. Not even joking. If he'd wait to take a few orders then prepare them, he'd save a few trips and probably about three minutes per order.  It also seems to be a normal practice to take slice orders from half our group, wait for that half to finish and pay, then take the other half. I should note that there are no less than four, and sometimes as many as six, people behind the counter when these shenanigans are going down. We wind up waiting, half of our group half done eating while the other half waits for food, about 50% of the time we visit.  I feel like I'm being kind of unfair here - usually we don't notice service irregularities. Maybe we're used to waiting for a while, maybe they aren't always as bad, but every so often it's taking a while, or half of us are asked what we want and half aren't, and we just sit there wondering, \"What are these people *doing*?\"  So, if the service is disappointing, why keep going, you ask? Simple: it's the closest pizza place to the office that we can all agree on. The pizza itself isn't bad, it's just getting to it is frustrating at times. Not infuriating, just frustrating."}
{"text":"Most of my experience with this location has been walk-in, so that's what I'm basing it on. Quality is comparable to other Pizza Pizza locations, as you'd expect from a chain - hits the spot, nothing to write home about. I find usually when I go in, the slice selection is simply sub-par, to put it alliteratively. I don't think I've been in with more than four or five on offer, a far cry from the eight or so I'm used to seeing from this chain.  The really off-putting part about this location is the seating arrangement - there's a surplus of benches and stools and only a couple tables. It's like a restaurant for introverts. A couple of the benches are hard enough to get by when nobody's sitting there as it is - I can't imagine navigating this place when it's nearer capacity (and it's not a place large enough to have to navigate).  No complaints about the service here - they've always been good to me, though they're sometimes hard to hear over the kitchen."}
{"text":"Well, despite the fact that it is open really late, their pizza is just sustenance, if you can call it that. It is not really great but it will crave your hungry especially if you are hungry. I would rather go somewhere else if possible. I suppose you shouldn't get the already made pizza where they reheated. It is probably best if you are going to eat an entire pizza with friends so you actually do get a decent pizza."}
{"text":"You always know no matter what location that you will get the same good tasting pizza. Located on a big plaza with a Grocery Store, Gas Station etc."}
{"text":"Service is shit  The front girl doesn't look like she wants to be there at all Deals are shit  Pizza is ok"}
{"text":"When I first moved here I tried to avoid Pizza Pizza as much as possible. I've heard some pretty horrific stories and bad things about their pizza.   This is my usual Pizza Pizza joint, right by my apartment. I actually don't mind their pizza. It's cheap! It's good. It's decent for the price. I like the pizza with the broccoli and sun-dried tomatoes on it -- Deeeelicious!   Although, the last time I was at this location I was sitting by myself next to the window and had my arm resting up on the sill. I looked over and -- ANTS. ANTS EVERYWHERE. I yelped and took my pizza and got out of there. It was gross.   I'll probably still go back there, just not to the window and sit down."}
{"text":"Very bad branch.  I was there tonight, cooker made pizza dough without gloves. Another employee was eating pizza topping with his hand  (of couse without gloves) from the container directly into his mouth.  On the top, haughty people careless of the customer satisfaction. Avoid this place!!!"}
{"text":"Best Canadian Eh! slice. The slices they sell are better than the pizza you order though."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday and ordered chicken wings (honey garlic) and Canadian pizza (mushrooms, pepperoni, bacon crumble) on whole wheat dough.   Within 20 minutes of eating my meal, I was running to the bathroom.   Never again will I eat at this location, or another pizza pizza for that matter. Nothing is more dissatisfying than trying to figure out what it was you ate from a store that could have caused you such stomach pain.. uncooked chicken? Maybe the mushrooms? Dirty employee hands? Yuck. Never again !"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just have to.  Their walk in, carry out specials are always insanely cheap and currently you can order a medium three topping pizza with a free poutine for $12.99 from their app. Free poutine.   I know Pizza Pizza isn't the best (it's actually the worst), but the specials are good when you're starving, cheap and craving cheese. This location is also housed in a beautiful old stone building... so that's something."}
{"text":"Pizza Pizza has its place. They have super fast delivery, and you can still get a medium pizza for about $15 at all hours of the night. Is it cardboard-y? Yes, but it comes with one free dipping sauce. Creamy garlic forever."}
{"text":"The service was moderate, pizza wasn't terrible but left quite a bit to be desired. Would most likely visit a separate location."}
{"text":"ive had to move on from this location, and it sucks.  the last three times we have ordered for delivery, this location would call us within ten minutes of the order placed, to explain that they were out of a certain topping we requested on our pizza, with no compensation for the lack of food. on a positive note, because we cut ties to this franchise location, we've found other beautiful locations of pizza establishments to spend our money on"}
{"text":"great location, no parking though, and the doors to enter the place, is a set of double doors, one of the doors you push, and the other door you pull, or maybe in reverse, I find it a bit odd that they have the doors in this orientation. otherwise, great service, and a great location to hit up after a concert or comedy night at the Danforth. lots of seating on the inside, and a very clean establishment.  great hours make this place an awesome place to get food for the subway ride home."}
{"text":"really happy with this location, not even from a pizza standpoint. this location is super convenient as it is a very nice option to anything that is in the area, even from just a drink standpoint this location is awesome. the store is pretty clean most of the time, but is always packed full of people either eating or in line for food. the staff here are great and the service is good, considering how much people/orders they have to deal with.  parking is on the street if available, and is serviced by the 509 harbourfront and the 510 spadina."}
{"text":"This is the location of the 1st Pizza Pizza store/pizzeria....Nothing fancy inside (not even the oven). Pleasant service (not that \"service quality\" should ever matter, as long as food good).  Pizza was just decent (dough looked somewhat beige/yellow, ordered thin crust, of course), did not skimp on extra cheese, and \"spicy sausage\" was not good (or spicy).   Paid $15 + tax (2018 CDN) for large with 3 sodas and 3 toppings, substituted 1 soda for a decent dipping sauce.  Fresca on College Street is way better for the same price."}
{"text":"1 star cos it's cheap... otherwise I have no use for this Pizza.... bland and tasteless... if you want a LOT of pizza for little money, this is your place... if you want GOOD PIZZA probably not..."}
{"text":"This place feels very unclean and unfriendly too. From the floors to the tables and counters. It's dated and needs a major scrub. We purchased the walk in special which was $5 and fine, but it would be nice to feel like your purchasing from a clean and friendly restaurant.
