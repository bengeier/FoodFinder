{"text":"Really disappointing experience.  We had high hopes given the lakefront location.  The portion size was very small, such as our shrimp appetizer included exactly 5 pieces of shrimp.  The beer selection was very poor and the cocktails were made very very poorly.  The entire staff all acted as if they would prefer to be anywhere else but work.  With enough other options go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Food is average, very crowded in summer, typically loud and boisterous. Like someone else said, a good place to go drink. Waitstaff is knowledgeable."}
{"text":"We decided to come here on a warm day in February to spend some time by the lake.  Unfortunately, as soon as we arrived we noticed a flock of seagulls swarming above the outdoor bar.  We tried to ignore them but a gull swooped down near my head and knocked a glass of water all over my lap.  Oh well, we laughed it off and kept drinking.  About 30 minutes later another gull pooped on my coat.  Hahaha, oh man, this place sure does have a lot of birds.  About 5 minutes later another gull pooped on my father-in-law's hat, my hair and my shirt.   Moral of the story, spill my drink once- shame on me.  Shit on me once- shame on you.  Shit on me twice-we're getting the flock outta here.    Thankfully, they were very nice and got us our bill quickly and gave us our food for free.  Don't know if we'd ever come back to enjoy the outdoor bar unless they do something about all the seagulls."}
{"text":"Ok.  I try this place 2 or 3 times a year praying it will get better.   I live i n the lake and its the only place to go if your out for a boat ride.  Without fail its always the same.   Dirty.... I'm looking at a spider web hanging from a moose head as I write this.   Sloooow service.   Poor to standard food.  If it wasn't for the monopoly of being on the lake they would be out of business."}
{"text":"If you like a nice view from the deck, mediocre food, and high prices, this is your place.  Way overpriced for the quality of what you get.  The filet bore a stunning resemblance to a cheap sirloin.  I had made a groupon reservation for Friday night.  It showed confirmed.  I told the waitress about it when I sat down.  At the end of the dinner the manager told me they do not accept Groupons on Friday night and made me pay full price.  Interestingly, he told me how he checked Thursday to see if there were any Friday reservations and did not see mine.  A rather obvious question would be why is he checking for Friday reservations if he doesn't accept them?  He proceeded to complain about all the problems he has with Groupon.  As if that somehow was my concern.  A reputable restaurant would have made an effort to do something to make it right.  The manager made no effort and allowed me to walk away furious.    Bottom line, the food is not good and the managment is poor.  You will notices this theme in other reviews.  I would believe them."}
{"text":"Went at lunch. Blackened chicken sandwich very tasty. Loaded potato skins were great!! Awesome view of lake."}
{"text":"Food is bland. Drinks aren't good. So unless you are going to just drink bottled beer, don't bother. Very dated, dark and dirty!"}
{"text":"As you can tell from all the other ratings, the food here is not very good. The drinks are great, the outside deck is great, and they are ALWAYS crowded with folks, but it is not for the food! The buffalo shrimp for a snack very tasty, but the steaks, the steak sandwiches, and the burgers are not. ONE EXCEPTION--The Ribs are not bad and edible! Go, have a drink, eat a snack, for that it's all good!"}
{"text":"The only reason that this place remains open is that it is the only place on the lake and it has a bar area.  Any other place opens on the lake and this place is closed in a month.  If I could give it no stars, I would.    The place was so disgusting that I had to look up their Restaurant rating.  They had a Grade C (74) from the SC Department of Health in March 2016.  Their customer service reflects this as they, manager included, don't care about whether you are happy with their food or service as they feel that there are enough drunk rednecks that come there to their bar to keep their place open for business.  I have never liked any of the food and their service has always been sub par, but it was at least fun to take a boat ride up there and have dinner.  Well, our latest trip will be our last.  After waiting for a boat slip for 30 minutes, we finally get in.  That's normal.  The waitress sits us at the back bar area, which was fine.  Then they move us to the front, which was also ok, but said that we would have to be done and out by 7:00.  It was 6:10, so we thought this was fine.  The waitress then tells us that we have to move back to where we were in the back bar.  Ok, moved there.  Then, another waitress told us that she spoke to the manager and that we could go back to the others area.  Ok, we will go there.  That takes about 10-15 minutes or so.  We really didn't care where we sat.  We just wanted to get our kids fed as soon as possible and to enjoy a Father's Day dinner.  We were biting our tongues because they kept moving us, but didn't say anything because we were trying to have a good time and celebrate Father's Day on the lake with the grandfather of the family.  We order food and then about 10 minutes later, the manager comes by and says that he has to box our food up and that we have to get out because they have a party coming in at 7:00.  It's now 6:40.  We have kids that need to eat and are getting cranky.  There was no attempt to moves us to another table elsewhere, move us to the other bar area where they were going to sit us earlier, or the outside seating.  When we asked to speak with the manager again and voiced our frustration as a family that has often come there and that we felt that we were being mistreated as patrons, the manager promptly told us that we can all leave.  There was no attempt to rectify the situation by the manager.  The manager showed no desire to offer to find another table to accommodate us or to offer something for displacing customers.  In fact, the manager first kicked out the grand mother of the family and then told the remainder of us that we can also leave with her when we told him how rude he was for treating our family this way.  The manager was quick to just turn to kicking out patrons of the place rather than trying to figure out what had happened to make us so upset with the service.  What ever happened to caring about how customers are served?  At the end of the day, this is a lake side bar that serves fried food to drunk people. It is not a family restaurant.  If you are looking for good food or good service, it hasn't been here ever!  You'll find better food and service at McDonald's.  In summary, if you are looking for white trash people to treat you like white trash, this is the place to be.  Do yourself a favor and stay away!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to T-Bones tonight.  We were trying to decide between 3 places, Lucky Lou's on Park Rd, Tyber Creek Pub in South End, or T-Bones.  It was my choice, so I chose T-Bones.  I remembered the atmosphere and the food.  We arrived, sat on the deck in front of dirty plates, spilled beer.  But, the space was empty so we thought we should grab it thinking someone would be by soon to clean and take our order.  15 minutes.  Another couple next to us (also dirty plates, they moved them).  I went and got a server, asking for service, for all of us.  Water.  Finally, a drink order.  I had to ask for another girl to please take the plates away and wipe our spot. And new napkins and silverware, as the spilled beer had gotten on them.  Long wait, nice waitress (Toby) shout out to her, sweet girl, apologetic and gracious.  Long wait. Food was expensive, prices increased since the last time we were there and less choice on the menu.  My husband had no condiment (he wanted ketchup), I asked for guacamole ($2) they brought 2 small slices of avacodo in a cup.  I sent it back.  Food was poor and expensive.  Long wait on another drink.  I went to the front looking for the owner (Haven).  I told 4 servers about the poor experience.  No Manager response.  Servers were gracious, apologetic.  Shout out to Pat, Katrina, and again, Toby.  My husband is a Walmart Manager, I am a Customer Service Specialist for a large corporation in uptown Charlotte.  We wanted a pleasant evening out, and made a very poor choice.  Dirty.  Poor service. No response from Management upon telling many people, and learning the owner's name (Haven).  I paid 42.00 before tip for a really poor Friday night dinner.  My husband said we could've gone to Cookout for a better meal.  We are not typical complainers, but after a week of work, we wanted to relax and enjoy an evening together.  The wait, mess, expense increase, less menu choice (used to be better), and poor food and service made us so sorry we had chosen this restaurant,  actually me, because my husband let me choose it, turned it into a poor dinner evening and experience.  Let me just say, Haven, you should have come out and spoken with us, the attention alone would have helped our opinion of poor service.  Don't blame your staff, they are only as good as you.  Just because you are on the lake does not afford poor experience and less quality.  Some people do not just come for the beer.  Some come for a good dining experience.  And shame on you for not caring for your patrons.  We will not be back.  And next time, it will be Tyber Creek or Lucky Lou's, or anywhere else.  Can you tell I'm furious?  I dropped my weekend expense for nothing.  Don't go here."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed.  Came here on the recommendation of a limo driver.  Bread was good and fresh, salad was OK... out came the signature T-bone and suddenly I thought I was at Ponderosa.  Mediocre quality, heavily salted, and small... the menu said 16 oz but I wish I could have put a scale on it in advance -- and yes I know they count the bone as part of the weight, but this thing was no thicker (or tastier) than three slices of sandwich bologna.  Best thing that could be said about it was that it was cooked correctly.  My wife got a ribeye and it was no better.  I'd give it one star except the service was very good and the bread was clearly fresh.  But I won't be back."}
{"text":"What on earth has happened to T Bones?!  This used to be an awesome place back in the late 90's and I used to hang here all the time.  It's been years and years since I have been and wanted to take my husband for dinner. The first thing that hits you is the smell when you walk in the lobby.  It's fishy, but it's not coming from the lake.  The place needs a complete professional, deep detailed cleaning. There is dust and cobwebs everywhere and a thick film of just nastiness on the surfaces.  The menus are dirty and sticky.  They were not busy. Our waitress was young and was way more interested with her phone and the male waitstaff than providing us good service. I remembered the filet tips being amazing and my husband wanted to try something new so he got a peanut chicken sandwich.  The filet tip meal did not come with a salad and was almost $20.  That was pretty lame. We got our food and it was on dollar store plates and very sad looking.  The portions were small and the peppers, mushrooms and onions that were with my tips were overcooked and soggy and the steak was overcooked.  I was bummed. My husband was so confused with his sandwich.  It was a small piece of dry chicken with weird slaw, hot sauce and a HUGE scoop of peanut butter - the ingredients did not go together at all.  We would have told the waitress, but she didn't come back until we were almost done. I did ask for bread because I also remember it being awesome and should have came with my meal.  It was old and cold and was sitting in a sad basket wrapped with a old linen.  It was half a loaf of mini bread with no knife. We used our hands to share it.  In short, this place has gone waaaaay down hill over the years and the owners don't seem to care. It's dirty, overpriced and the service is poor. I guess it is just another spot (like all the other bars in Lake Wylie) for locals to sit and drink outside. It's too bad, I remember when there would be a line out the door and inside and outside would be packed on the weekends and the food was really good. Nice location, but I will never go back again."}
{"text":"Meatloaf just tasted weird! Ordered appetizer with chips and three dipping sauces. Very few chips. Asked for more chips...$4! Fruit cup...$3! Substitute salsa for fattening sour cream...50 cents extra. $65 for three people...burger, grilled chicken and shrimp plate."}
{"text":"Classy.  That is sarcasm.  But, it's only restaurant on Lake Wylie. So there."}
{"text":"This is the worst example of a \"Steakhouse\" ever.  The owner is a self righteous fool that loves to cause trouble if you give feedback.  Lousy place on Lake wylie, sc"}
{"text":"T-Bones is always a fun spot to hangout with a nice view of Lake Wylie, but I will say that the food is mediocre. The service is usually pretty good and the beer is cold."}
{"text":"This place has went downhill bad. I remember going here for prom or when people would visit from out of town. Now im not so sure. The service sucks. The food is pretty mediocre. I was there on a Friday night and ordered the prime rib only to be informed that they were out. So I ordered a ribye and it was ok. The steak was cooked right but just didn't have much flavor. After dinner we went on the deck so my daughter could feed the ducks. When I got out there I grabbed a chair so she could see over the deck and the bartender rudely told me that I can't use the chair. It is only for people sitting at the bar. I hope this place fixes some of these problems because I want to like it again"}
{"text":"Not good for food. Cost us 50 bucks for 2 orders of ribs with one side and soda. The food was terrible. I remember a time when the food was good , not sure what happened to this place. This was my last trip there."}
{"text":"The service here is the worst. My family of nine made a visit to this establishment on Saturday 8 August, approximately 11:30am. We were directed to booth seating, which was unacceptable for our group. My father who is disabled (which is obvious, because he has a prosthetic leg and walks with a cane). We requested the large round table and was told it was only for a party for 10-12. A request was even made to the manager (Amanda) who's nonverbal communication demonstrated that they could care less if T-Bones received our business, so we visit the nearby BBQ Pit in which we were accommodated and the food is very good."}
{"text":"Certainly will not be back! Disgustingly filthy and the decor is atrocious to say the least. By the time I left and by the way my stomach felt, I was afraid I was going to be the next dusty cob-web covered taxidermy victim on the wall. The food was pretty bad...frozen dry potato skins that tasted like they were made back in the summer and microwaved. Roast beef sandwich that was basically 3 or 4 pieces of processed store bought roast beef on a roll with cheese and grilled onions and peppers (clearly frozen prior to grilling). The French fries were undercooked and even the iced tea had a nasty taste as if their tea container hadn't been cleaned in months. After refusing to finish any of the meal, I had to rush to the bathroom with bad stomach cramps. Having grown up on the Chesapeake Bay and experiencing so many great waterfront resteraunts I had high hopes for this place. It could be so much better.   PLEASE, if nothing else, clean that place before someone really gets sick! Probably one of the filthiest dining rooms I have seen in a long time. Really makes me wonder how dirty the kitchen is. The owners and managers can't be so blind not to see the decades worth of dust and cob-webs on all the junk and dead carcasses located throughout this place.  Reluctant to even give this place 1 star! Time for \"Kitchen Nightmare\" intervention maybe?  UPDATE..... Okay, it now 7 hours after my not so tasty (questionably safe) lunch at T-Bones today and my stomach is still doing flip-flops even after a bout of diarrhea (sorry to give such detail but important to note). The health department really needs to take a much closer look at this place...honestly folks!"}
{"text":"Don't go here for the food!  This is a perfect place to go for a cold one (or two) after a long day of boating and wakeboarding. The atmosphere on the deck is vivd and the view over the boat dock and Lake Wylie is nice.  Yeah, it's very crowded and it can take some time to find an empty dock and then to find an empty table (or chair) on the deck - but to us it's worth it.  You might have noticed I haven't really mentioned their food yet, well... that's because it's really not worth mentioning. The food reminds me of the stuff you get in one of those typical tourists traps at the beach.. deep fried and overcooked..  Oh well, we will continue to come here - just not for the food."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was a little worried.  But the atmosphere was great out on the deck and the food was good I had the tenderloin sandwich that was great.  My man had the shrimp Alfredo he liked it had a lot of shrimp but returned to haunt him later in the evening,  maybe stick to bar food here but all and all it was a good place will return."}
{"text":"Went there on Valentine's Day...had to wait for a table, which was fine until someone else walked in 20 minutes later without a reservation and was seated right away and when they went to seat us the hostess was told she seated the last couple at a dirty table so we would have to wait, so again we waited. Once seated our waitress served us our drinks in styrofoam cups, all of her tables were served like this, at the end of our meal we found out it was so she could just hand us a lid and let us take it with us. The food, oh my the food okay so they forgot the bread so we had to ask for it when we received the meal. With a $20 steak you get one side and this was a 7oz ribeye they're sides consisted of about 8 different types of potatoes a cucumber salad and cole slaw no other vegetables except the veg of the day. The steak was under cooked and I ordered medium rare. The ketchup on the table had started fermenting because they continue to refill the glass bottles and I'm assuming they never throw them away, how about taking a bite of that on a romantic night out. My boyfriend ordered crunchy peanut butter chicken sand which thinking it was a batter of sorts, but no he was literally served an open face grilled chicken sandwich with a scoop of crunchy peanut butter sitting in the center, now this is printed on the menu we checked afterward but why on earth would you serve that on a menu. When he questioned it he was offered another selection but said no since it took so long to cook to begin with, even though he did not eat it we were still charged full price for the meal. Horrible experience and not worth the money. The bread was good that's about it, the rest I could've cooked better at home a whole lot cheaper."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the negative reviews this place has received. We found the food to be very good and the service prompt and efficient. I wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"We have been going to TBones on the Lake for years.  We live on Lake Wylie so it is a nice boat ride.  The reviews I read about the cleanliness is right on. Tonight was the worst in service and food.  The kid that waited on us got our order incorrect.  My fish and chips came without the chips.  I had ordered slaw as an extra side.  The slaw came and was awful. I was afraid to eat a lot of it.  My fries came after we were pretty much through eating.  They tasted like they had been cooked in burnt grease.  Then he charged me for them.  We always leave a great tip because we know how hard it is to be a server but tonight my husband left a tip saying  bad service ; bad tip. This place needs renovation and cleaned up desperately.  Some of the best flounder I have ever eaten used to come from here.  I am sad to see it go down hill.   We also had a family near us that couldn't control their kids and I think they thought we were at a McDonalds Play land. Tonight was a miserable time here. We will probably come back home to eat from now on when going on a boat ride."}
{"text":"Location is perfect view to the lake but services pretty slow, food average a place to get a beer and see the lake ......"}
{"text":"This place is Super gross  it's like eating inside the public toilet. It stinks inside, my patients but ts smells  better than this place, Gross Gross gross.  The food looks like my patients vomit."}
{"text":"The place, setting and location are great. But the food is horrible. Every appetizer and main dish is horrible. Beer selection is better in my house. No Amber ales or pale ales. All the beers are for college kids. And the place can be renovated for sure"}
{"text":"No good. And it's a big shame because with the awesome location If they actually had decent food this place could be jumpin every night. My mom who's been here several times warned us before we left \"we go here for the views and to be outside some nights, but really you can only get a few of the appetizers and vegetables if you want anything ok\"."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always amazing. I love their steaks. Always so juicy and never overcooked.  Their lunch menu is pretty great to. I love the outside patio they have that sits atop the water and the views are pretty. I love to go here on special occasions. Love love love Tbones!"}
{"text":"Took my beautiful wife and her cousin hear last night. There was a band named smiling dog, they were very good if you like loud older rock. The atmosphere was hopping. The place was packed. There was an off duty officer, no shenanigans. This place sits on Lake Wylie and offers plenty of boat parking. There is outdoor area in summer over the water. There steaks are awesome. Makes a great place for lunch when your out boating."}
{"text":"On a whim tonight, we decided to try T-Bones. I've driven by many times, and the location, right on the lake, looks very nice.  You can tell from the general exterior decor that this place was probably last remodeled back in 1975.... but I'm not going to pass judgement on that. As we all know, sometimes places like this can have excellent food, be quite charming, and a good time.  Since it's November, it was dark, and there of course was no outside seating.... no boats bobbing in the water... so other than a nice clear night with glassy water in the moonlight, there was not much to see. We did get seated at a very nice window seat, thanks to the hostess, who had orders barked to her by the \"manager\", who resembled a female version of Jabba The Hut from Star Wars... I felt bad for the hostess.  I think the food was very good.... I had the Fantail Shrimp, our son a burger, and my wife the Gorgonzola/Walnut stuff chicken. We had an appetizer of the stuffed mushrooms. As far as the food goes, the mushrooms were probably really the only letdown of the evening.... slightly over-priced and underwhelming.... the gravy they were sitting in left much to be desired..... not terrible..... but not $9.95 appetizer good.....  ya know???  Initially, when we sat, our server greeted us promptly, which I thought was great. Sadly, this was the only server-like action she took for the rest of the evening. After bringing our drinks, and taking our order, she was not to be seen again until after the main course had been delivered. My drink was empty, my wife's water was empty... she had wanted to order a beer. When our server finally did stop by, she did not ask about our food.... but at least we were able to order more drinks. When my wife asked what beer was on tap, she had no idea..... and didn't really seem to care to have an idea.  I noticed that our server would disappear for long periods of time. In the time it took her to come out once, the server in the next section had made the rounds 4-5 times.... making sure everyone was ok, filling sodas/waters, etc. We were left sitting, alone.  When we were finally done, she came to get plates. There were a few, since of course she hadn't been around to gather anything through the course of dinner. Since she couldn't take them all, she left a stack of dirty plates on our table - disgusting.    At that point, I laid down 4 crisp $20's for our $75-ish tab, and we got the heck outta there...... as we departed the \"manager\" (Jabba The Hut) wished us good night in a very un-caring tone, and we noticed upon leaving the dinner specials - not mentioned to us by our server at all!!!!  Absolutely terrible.  So.... this place could be a solid 3-ish.... IF you get a good server... and if it's summer, and you sit outside, and it's nice..... you might hit a 4.  Again, our main courses we ordered were pretty good.... but with the poor service, our dinner basically sucked."}
{"text":"Best thing about here is the view.  Went for Sunday brunch and was very disappointed.  Poor selection, just a mix of your average breakfast fair; grits, eggs, biscuits.  Eggs were cold and the fresh fruit wasn't fresh.  There wasn't much to choose from on the lunch menu.  Worst thing was the loud dance music.  I actually really like electronic music, but not at 1pm on a Sunday overlooking a lake.  Next time I'll just drive 5 more minutes for a better restaurant and enjoy the view as I drive over the bridge."}
{"text":"So nasty. Every time I've been here its been worse than the last time. This is the place you go when nothing else is open.  You have to be drunk to want to eat here. It's dirty , food is gross and the wait staff is just pathetic. Only nice thing is the view and the kids enjoying feeding the ducks. Sad for such a prime piece of real estate to not be maximizing it. Decor looks like you have time traveled to 1970. Perfect place for Gordon Ramsey and Kitchen Nightmares."}
{"text":"I'm so over T-Bones.  I used to relish the thought of hanging out on their big deck on one of the first warm days of the year, treating myself to their yummy grilled chicken salad or wings--the only 2 things on their menu that I liked.  I was even willing to tolerate the funky smell of the main restaurant on my way out to the deck.  But the last 3 times I've been to T-Bones, the food and service have been awful.  And they changed the menu, removing the grilled chicken breast salad that I liked.  The sweet tea was almost as clear as water, and painfully sweet--undrinkable.  I'm sorry, T-Bones.  We tried to make it work, but it takes two.  Please stop relying on the fact that you're the only place (I know of) in the area where you can eat the water's edge.  It's just not enough to keep us coming anymore.  You actually have to serve good food and decent drinks."}
{"text":"Food was ok, atmosphere however was pretty good for a quick stop off the lake. First time I went music wasn't good but second trip the performer was phenomenal. All in all not a bad place to stop in for a bite while on the lake."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy but food was good, service was good and view overlooking the lake is awesome.  This is only a few minutes from the house so I anticipate going back to try more menu items and social events.  All in all, a nice option locally since I am new here."}
{"text":"T-bones is a great place to go if you're on the water on Lake Wylie. It is basically the only restaurant on the lake that Has docks for pulling your boat up to have lunch. The outdoor deck and live music are always nice but always crowded. The only food that I could recommend on their menus would be The burgers and quesadillas. I would never eat the seafood there again after both myself and my wife got sick on different occasions inning the fried shrimp. The Sunday morning Bloody Mary bar is a nice touch if you're up for that."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, Christi provided great service beyond what was expected.  Drinks were cold, food was delicious.  Recommend sitting on the  deck, the live band provided great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great view of the lake! Great drink specials. The guac and catfish basket were delicious! Great margs too!"}
{"text":"Racist and ignorant. Before today, I would have given this place a 3 star for its convenience of dining if boating on Lake Wylie. The food is simple and lacks any depth of flavor - mainly salt.  Not only did the staff and Management act as if they were annoyed I was there with my family, but one staff had the audacity to say a racist comment to another staff and didn't realize I was walking up behind her. She quickly turned away as if nothing was said.  It's very disappointing. I was both furious and sad. There was no reason nor is there ever a reason."}
{"text":"Very dirty, inside has a smell to it. Food is just \"okay\".. drinks are overpriced. Service is average at best. The only reason this restaurant is still open is because it's the only place you can dock your boat on Lake Wylie."}
{"text":"I would have given it 2.5 stars but you have to go with 2 or 3.   Pro's: location, location, location. Large outdoor deck and bar. Live music. Great gathering place for the locals or those who want to enjoy a view of the lake. Excellent after work stop also. The tall thin woman really works hard and is on top of things.   Con's: Outdated decor and seating, average food to sub par food. Can be difficult to get a drink sometimes as it does get busy. Drinks outside of the happy hour can be a bit pricey, $4 for a bottle of Corona for here is a bit much I could see that at an uptown bar or something but not T-Bones. Idiots that sit there and throttle their outboards and choke out the people on the deck with their exhaust.   The place is quirky and odd, the can be a pro or a con for some. It is a part of Lake Wylie as much as the lake it seems. Go for the entertainment and think of this place more like a start to the night. They get bands and their is no cover."}
{"text":"Great location in the old Hungry Fisherman restaurant on the water on Lake Wylie. Lousy food."}
{"text":"The only thing going for this place is the view. The potato skin app came out cold. The dip trio app is salsa and cheese dip from a jar in the fridge. The salad is more toppings than lettuce. Way overpriced for the quality of food they serve."}
{"text":"I honestly didn't experience any of the instances that were mentioned by the previous negative comments. T-Bones was not a mediocre experience filled with blandness.   What T-Bones was for me is this. My GF and I decided to try something new this past weekend. I had a Ribeye that was slightly undercooked (by MY mistake) and the friendly waitstaff, even under these circumstances, took my steak back and prepared me a brand new medium-rare steak more to my satisfaction. They even put garnish on the plate and made it as beautiful as it was delicious! The appetizer we ordered was definitely NOT pre-cooked or \"frozen\" like these comments implied. I could tell they had a \"homemade\" touch to them. My only \"complaint\" is that they didn't have Sweetwater IPA. I would have really loved one of those with my steak.  I honestly would love to explore the menu a bit more, but I felt that my testimony of this restaurant needed to be put out there. This is hands-down, an AWESOME place and has a great atmosphere.  I would eat here again!"}
{"text":"Snagged some lunch on the water and got in right as they opened. The waiter/waitress staff seemed to miss us coming in because we wanted 15 minutes before I had to get up and ask them to serve us. They were apologetic and nice, so that was ok. Had the flounder and fish tacos. Both good, not land breaking or anything. The cleanliness is what you'd expect from an \"on-the-lake\" restaurant. Fun experience. Not surprised if I don't go back much."}
{"text":"T-Bones is that place you go if you're boating on Lake Wylie and want to grab some bar food on the patio. Think Rusty Rudder on Lake Norman, but not as good. Went here for a quick business lunch with a colleague and sat inside as it was a hot day. The place reminds me of a 1970's/1980's outback steakhouse if they existed. Long walkway to get tot the restaurant onto the water/dock. Service was good, though the food was nothing special. Ordered the burger and it was decent though the fries were a little soft. Started with the crab dip and it was just ok...nothing I would recommend.   Like a said, great patio area if you're there for some drinks and maybe a few apps. For a destination dinner, I think not."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the lake and keep coming back. Last couple visits were rough due to the lack of servers. Looks like problem solved!! Today we have a great server. Jay is super personable and a great server. If they keep this up it will be even more difficult to get a spot to sit. Lol  Food is always consistent. Burgers, ribs, salads and soups are always good. Beer is super cold and I feel like i am on vacation when I come here.  Recommended"}
{"text":"Food is overpriced. Our nachos were cold. Server was not attentive as we went a good while without anything to drink. Overcharged us on beer and margarita and didn't change it after I even pointed it. Needless to say, this will probably be my last time!"}
{"text":"Poor beer selection No Guinness so went with second choice and they were out of that as well .  Not enough waitstaff on outside deck, got own drinks and sat for 30 minutes before a waitress finally came over then just to tell us we couldn't sit where we were . Ended up leaving and going somewhere else . Always heard the food and staff wasn't good but you would think at least they would have had a good beer selection, don't see us going back anytime soon ."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to T-Bones. We weren't especially hungry but wanted to chill and enjoy the lake. We sat on the deck, which was full once we claimed a table.   We both ordered the Filet Chunks, a dish from the appetizer page - chunks of filet, blackened, served over Roquefort cream sauce, and topped with Bleu Cheese crumbles. The dish caught my eye because I've recently become a real fan of Bleu Cheese crumbles. (Sounds like as good a reason as any.). My husband and I were both pleased with our choice and highly recommend this dish. The filet was quite tender and had a little \"kick\" from being blackened. The sauce made a good taste contrast and the Bleu Cheese topped it off. Try it, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Went there last night and I was disgusted with the service. First the gratuity was 18 percent me and my wife had a burger and fries (cold) and 3 drinks ( weak) the bill 70 bucks. I strongly suggest you avoid this hole in the wall oops I meant hole on the lake"}
{"text":"T-Bones is well below average. Starting with the drinks. Tea was very weak and the glasses were very small. Appetizer, hot wings, were mediocre at best. Not hot and sorta greasy. Wife got salad, which was unimpressive and a little wilted. Wife had filet, which she described as  a poor cut of meat, tough with gristle. I got a ribeye, if you could call it that. It appeared to be pan fried, as is was greasy. It was a very poor cut of meat, with much fat and gristle. Sweet potato was good, except it was very small.    Service was good, as we were in a group of 12.  Glasses were kept full and service prompt. Cost is hard to believe! You pay for a choice cut of meat and get Waffle House food.   I went to this place probably 15 years ago. Was not impressed then. Has gotten worse. Not inclined to go to places were they have to have armed police officers on duty for the protection of their patrons.   This placed is off the list. Will not return!"}
{"text":"Since I moved to Charlotte, this has been my favorite steak place. But not just the steak. The seafood bisque is delish. I've had the Apple Walnut Chicken salad and the Strawberry Almond Spinach salad; the Chipotle Chicken sandwich, the Ultimate Roast Beef sandwich; Texas chili; pickle chips, ohhh my the stuffed mushrooms! and the Ribeye steak (my fave) always cooked just right!  Honestly I've had lunch there more often than dinner, but have loved it every single time. inside or on the patio.  The ambiance is date-great! Casual but romantic. I love to be near the water!"}
{"text":"Everyone was more than happy with their food. Our server was friendly and on the spot. The sweet potato fries were some of the best I've had. Looking forward to stopping in the warmer weather."}
{"text":"First the good..... 1.  It's on the lake.   2.  They have live music (and most of the time great performers) 3.  You can meet a lot of great people from all over there. 4.  Good drinks  Now on to the bad.... 1.  Old and dated.  Inside is dark and has no appeal, even the windows that let you see the lake are cruddy. 2.  Menu is not what you would expect from a lakefront place, more like something you could go find in any crummy bar.  Food is horrible, many people we have met there come to enjoy a few drinks then go elsewhere for dinner.  We have given it a few chances but keep being disappointed.  Last time we ate there (last week) we were served 1 or 2 day old guacamole and everything came in plastic containers.  If I am going to pay for a meal, give me regular dinnerware!  If this place was not right on the water I know there would be no customers there, would shutdown fast. 3.  Such a beautiful setting for a dumpy looking place.  It is so dated, bathrooms are horrible, outdoor deck is dark and dreary.  I have no idea why they would not try to update and make it more of a waterfront looking establishment.....and update their menu.  T-BONES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE GIVE US BETTER!!"}
{"text":"Location is perfect. Live music was super good on the deck.  But the food... oh my.. Expect fast food quality here. The fish taco tastes like something you get from a frozen box. There is absolutely no flavor on it.  I wish this place was more unique. Not just the typical lower end American Cuisine  (burger/fries/fried chicken tenders/fried fish..) that you get at any Walmart. Service was not bad. I only wrote this review, because I think this place has a huge potential, but I think it needs that  kitchen TV Show to come by and completely change it upside down. :)"}
{"text":"Location, location, location.  If it weren't for the fabulous location, this place would be a 2 star teetering on the edge of 1.    Service - Hit and miss.  A small handful are good, but many are neglectful.  Food: Blackened Chicken Club - The best item in the menu we've found so far.  Chicken is juicy and overall it's a good sandwich.  Fries - Somewhere under the thick crystalline layer of salt was a potato.    Sweet Potato Fries - Crispy and tasty with a light sweetness.  Tomato Bisque Soup - Too salty but also lacking in flavor.  Potato Skins - Well, you can't go wrong with potato skins.  Always a smart choice :)  Chicken Wings Hotter - It had a good crispness.  The sauce was Franks Red Hot.  Pina Colada - ...probably the worse I've ever had.  Overall, the food was average to below average.  I can't remember what we got the last few times, but really, the Chicken club was the only thing we found worth getting.  As long as we have sunny days on the lake, we'll probably still stop here once in a while, because like i said, the location is amazing.   Where else can you park your boat?"}
{"text":"Just not goid at all. There we us and one other table at 1:30pm, so that had me worried to start off. Our server was so SLOW and seemed more concerned about socializing than serving. I had to get up and ask for a refill twice. I had a grilled chicken salad and my friend had a club sandwich. After 25 minutes, i had to ask about our order and it was still another 10 minutes. Food was not very good either. For those prices we expected better. I sure won't return."}
{"text":"You don't go to a place like this because the food calls you,  you go for the view! We stick to bar food appys and it hits the spot.  The service is always so very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Lake is very nice. But, I just noticed servers have tables inside and out. That makes them late to the tables they need to take care of and the decor was poor. I got a chipotle chicken sandwich and the bun was really soggy from the pickle juice, but the chicken was really tasty, and juicy.   In conclusion, it needs some work (decor, waiters and waitresses dealing with tables in and out."}
{"text":"I should have read reviews before going out to dinner here. The service was incredibly slow. We sat at our table next to the bar for 15 minutes before deciding to move to the bar. Even sitting at the bar we had to get the bartenders (there were 3 of them) attention everytime we wanted something. Only had the nachos, which weren't anything special. We asked for salsa to dip them in and 10 minutes later they brought us ole El Paso in a small to go cup. we were going to order food but after telling the bartender we were ready to order, he didn't come back to take our order. so I asked another bartender to close out tab and we got dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"Location, location, location is the strength of this eatery! Views of the lake, a great outdoor bar and lots of parking for your truck or your yacht. Friday night the restaurant was slow and we were seated promptly. A very engaging hostess as well as the wait staff.   The menu offers a variety of items mostly fried choices. Eating lite, I ordered a small bowl of chili and a quesadilla. The chili was served luke warm, mild/bland flavor and beanless, as advertised. The quesadilla was soggy. Other guests ordered a fried chicken sandwiches which were \"ok\", ribs \"to die for\" and a salad which looked wilted.   One of our guests was looking for a specific item which was missing from the menu. The waiter said the item had been dropped. The manager was quick to followup with an explanation \"Chef is upgrading the menu\" and the item was no longer available. Made the guest feel appreciated other than a flat \"no got\"!  Our friends live near by and say this is one of the better places to eat in the area and there's the lake. Once the sun sets T-Bones is just a red neck bar( no offense intended) with a great view of the lake and below average food.  If you've been on the lake all day, in a swim suit and tee shirt this may be the perfect choice. By the way.....they do have live music on weekends!  PS: the ever present armed Sheriff Department officer patrolling the inside of the restaurant/bar gave one a nice secure feeling!"}
{"text":"Food is hit or miss -- usually, miss. Wait staff can be inattentive & easily distracted by all the \"action\" going on or too busy socializing amongst themselves.  The only reason to go here is for the drinks & to enjoy the lakeside deck."}
{"text":"Go for the view. Maybe not the lake but the locals !  And the cold beer on the deck makes this place wonderful !!  I'd return. I'd have another great conversation with a random stranger. I'd share a shot with them too. I honestly don't remember the food but it was plentyiful and fast. And you can get from her to there by boat !  Awesome"}
{"text":"The service is absolutely horrid. , passing plates over peoples heads instead of walking around. The food choices are crappy for a place this size. The food itself is not of a quality you would expect from a place in this location. Prices for quality and quantity are way out of the norm. Pushy and unprofessional service topped us to get the hell out...a party of 16 people...sad"}
{"text":"The only reason we ever eat here is to sit on the deck overlooking the lake.  Service is slow and the food is not good at all.  Ribs are the best item on the menu, everything else is tasteless.  It's amazing that they don't 'get it' that people are just eating here because they are the only restaurant on the water.  An improvement in service and food would be nice."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon...not super busy. Got seated quick.  Good drinks.  Cold beer. Food quality is ok.  We had a Party of 3....After waiting 30 minutes for a salad, had to ask for manager.  Found out that the ticket for the salad got lost.  Long story short...got a free salad out of the deal.  Had the waitress come back to check on how our food was, she would have seen that one of us hadn't got our meal.  This is the second trip here for lunch.  May try it for dinner one day."}
{"text":"First, the view of Lake Wylie is amazing! The decor leaves a bit to be desired, I can't quite tell if it's trying to be dive, trying to be kitchy, or if it's going for a wild west theme... but it's a bit confusing and the ambiance is only so-so. I went with a group of 13 for lunch and I think our bunch overwhelmed the lunch kitchen staff and servers. Service was friendly but pretty slow. We ordered to appetizers and the only options seemed to be fried or fried... so I had to pass on the appetizers. I ordered a spinach strawberry salad that was mediocre, but nothing super special. I feel lke T-Bones is a great place to boat up to and get a beer/burger  ... but I probably won't suggest it for a group lunch in the future. I would like to try it for dinner on a weekend, my guess is this place is a lot more fun on Saturday evenings!"}
{"text":"They may not know my name, but they know what I like.   T-Bones is a fun place to cruise to by boat. We enjoy the outside bar & patio the most. Sure, service can be slow, but how can anyone get upset when your relaxing on the lake.  We love their ribs, Budweiser on tap and the view.  Cons...its a popular place on the weekends, so we tend to go during lunch hours or Thurs night.  Love their live music acts in the back."}
{"text":"If they would make some of the dock non-smoking I would go there occasionally.  Food is below average compared to the other options in Lake Wylie."}
{"text":"Nice view! It was a slow day in the restaurant and we had decent service. Slow on the refills but it was fine. Service was friendly, food was average!"}
{"text":"My wife and I attempted to dine here yesterday and it went very badly.  First, it took more than 10 minutes to be seated because no one was monitoring the hostess station.  My wife had to grab a waitress to help.  Next, our waitress brought us to a table and took a drink order.  Then, it was another 15 minutes until she came by for our food order.  Then my wife and I went to the restroom to wash our hands.  A while later, the waitress refilled our drinks.  After 30 minutes of waiting for our food, while other tables seated after us were getting their food order, my wife asked another waitress what was happening because our waitress wouldn't stop by our table.  That waitress said that our waitress thought we had left.  However, she had previously refilled our drinks and was walking past our table when serving other customers.  It just didn't add up.  While one of the wait staff offered to buy our meal, we turned it down.  The waitress assigned to our table never came by when all of this was going on.  In the end, we went up the street to Taco Bell, where the service was much better.  I do consulting and conclude that the restaurant's management is weak.  There's a lack of customer focus and the wait staff isn't being held accountable."}
{"text":"What was once a favorite spot, is  not on my list of preferred eateries in the area. The food was good, but I remember when it was great. Sadly the building has not aged well, the musty smell tends to slightly exceed the stale beer odor. I plan to go back and hope things are better."}
{"text":"Awesome view of the lake while dining,  the wait staff is under trained and unorganized. My first trip here was this past father's day and it was packed surprisingly had a short wait. No complaints on the food ,I had the catfish basket and my wife had ribs both came in large portions and was great."}
{"text":"The Ahi tuna and steak tender appetizers are awesome...love the chilie too!!!  Great staff that provides incredible service always w a smile.  Love the restaurants Children's Charity and community involvement.  Great place, great people and good food. If your going for gormet or great steaks (despite the name) this is not your place, but if you want, good food, service and view...the place to be."}
{"text":"The food is much better when you've been drinking. I remember going to T-Bones when I had my boat and hanging out on the patio for hours... But now when my wife and I go there, the food seems... boring. Don't get me wrong, they've got a great atmosphere, decent food and an awesome patio, but it just doesn't have any *bang*!  I typicaly get the burger or chicken sandwich or sampler (around 6-8 dollars) and the sandwiches are usually dry and have not a lot of flavor whereas the sampler is pretty decent. I do like going on Mondays for their all-u-can-eat ribs (15 bucks or so). My \"better half\" loves the crab dip.  They have live entertainment on the weekends in their back bar (They have 3 bars there: 1 in the back room, 1 on the patio, and 1 near the front. ) The manager, Aaron, runs a nice little place overall but I guess all of my years of patronage have watered down my taste for the place.  Summertime Rule - If you go and hang out on the weekends, go early, because the patio gets packed!"}
{"text":"Food not great! Drinks good. Service ehhh... If it wasn't the only bar/restaurant you could ride up to, I think this place would cease exist. Lake Wylie you deserve better! DEMAND IT! Until then, it'll do... \"Bartender! Another round please!\""}
{"text":"As a bar with a nice view of the Lake, it's not bad although the lake is way down at this point and a large amount of the grassy area around the restaurant were under two to six feet of water six months ago.  Meet a former colleage from work for lunch today.  I had their version of a Cuban called a Pork Loin Sandwich.  Not bad except for the cole slaw.  I know cole slaw is a Carolina thiing but you don't have to put it on everything.  Otherwise it was excellent and the fries that came with it were pretty good as well.  My friend  had a pound of wings with hot sauce and he really enjoyed them.  Food was OK, not outstanding, the bar scene was good and the servers were outstanding. We ate at the bar on the outside deck and it was pleasant.  Warm but not too hot with a great view."}
{"text":"Very excited about the changes to t bones!! This is the only place to eat on lake Wylie so we come here a lot. The menu and food have always been pretty good but this season the menu is even better, the food is great (I had the kale salad and kale salad isn't exactly what I would normally like but I'm trying to be good... It was phenomenal!) I've never really been disappointed here but never been wowed either. Now I'm flat out excited to come back!"}
{"text":"I have been dining here since I was a child with my family. Always an excellent experience. Popped in this past Monday for a drink and a bite to eat and was pleasantly surprised with musical bingo. Ended up winning a $10 gift certificate. Great food, great view of Lake Wylie from the deck, many things such as live music and games going on. You can even ride up on your boat and tie off at their own dock! Definitely should check it out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"T-Bones is average all around.  Average food and average service.  The best feature of T-Bones is the outdoor deck and its views of Lake Wylie, but expect to wait for a table outside as it's first come first serve and most weekends the deck is overflowing.    I'd recommend T-Bones only for a few drinks and live music.  Seems like a great mid-afternoon pit-stop for boaters though."}
{"text":"We love this place. Live music and a great group of people working here makes this our friendly local hangout. Foods good too!"}
{"text":"I stopped by on a sunny fall day to have a quick lunch on the deck and had the lunch special of open faced roast beef with mashed potatoes and gravy. I made an excellent choice and it was true comfort food.  Been years since I've had that and it was great!"}
{"text":"This is my second really good experience here at T-Bones On The Lake... It was packed but first come first serve on the dock...we walked out just as people were getting up so we sat right away....Awsome! We all had the catfish and fries...it came out fresh and hot and fast! We ate and paid just in time to avoid the rain....again Awsome!!!"}
{"text":"After reading other reviews, I'm glad I'm not the only one who has experienced the bad food and service.  I've been there twice, both times it took some effort to get served.  Today was the worst, though.  My husband got to the table first and ordered his drink. When my daughter and I sat down, it was several minutes before we got any attention from the server.  We then (finally) were able to order drinks - I ordered a Bushwacker, but got what I think was a terrible Pina Colada instead.  I couldn't drink it, so terrible, so I sent it back and ordered a beer.  Finally got menus after asking.  Ordered an app (the Filet Bites, actually really awesome) but once it was brought to the table, asked our server twice for silverware and then had to go up and get it ourselves.  Ordered a bacon cheeseburger and rack of ribs for dinner. My daughter loved the ribs, the cheeseburger was minus the bacon, but otherwise not bad.    When I asked our server to remove the charge for the bacon and the drink I had sent back, she said she could take off the bacon ($1) but not the drink without asking the manager.    I don't think I'll go back there, unless it is by boat for a quick beer and the view."}
{"text":"It receives a two star only because I was sitting on a deck looking out on a lake. The Tiki Sangria was blah. I ordered the fried shrimp basket...I could have done better going to WalMart and cooking frozen shrimp myself. Come to think of it that may have been what they did along with the french fries. Not sure I would ever eat inside. It smells of soured rags, I guess they use those to wipe down the tables. Not a favorite and doubt I will ever return."}
{"text":"We are here once over a year ago before we moved into the area.  The food was bland and it was so old decorations inside.  I really wish someone would buy this place and turn it around.  It has a fantastic view on the lake, only a few place I might add on the lake. If this place turned around and served great food I would go every week."}
{"text":"Horrible service... My husband's steak came to the table raw!  So basically we had to eat at separate times while a meal he could eat without becoming sick was prepared.  Never checked on,  offered additional drinks or dessert.  No apologies for uncooked food!!!  Not asked how things were,  my guess is because didn't want to hear the answer!!!"}
{"text":"Go for the lakeside views/live music/bar on a deck atmosphere. Stay for the...well, you'll stay for those same things, because the food is nothing to write home about. Overpriced too."}
{"text":"T-Bones is average stuff. The food (lunch) was pretty average all around as is the service. It gets crowded on the weekends and the staff seems overwhelmed, but they do get around to you eventually.   The only item I considered 'good' were the grilled fish tacos. The ribs and roast beef sandwich were 'passable'.   The best feature of T-Bones is the lake view. Outdoor tables and the bar are especially crowded and seating is a free-for-all, meaning go find your own table. They have large umbrellas and fans to keep the temperature bearable out in the sun."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch on a Thursday. The wait staff was helpful and service was quick. The views were nice, but the food wasn't something I'd return for. I ordered the classic Reuben sandwich; however, there was so much butter on the bread that it was soggy and way too salty. My husband ordered the T-bone steak which was okay, but not seasoned very well and at about $28 we've both had way better steak. I may return, but it would be for a drink at the outdoor bar and to enjoy the views."}
{"text":"As usual, good service great food, great place to sit outside and enjoy the lake! Love the tenderloin chunks, and the fried shrimp...I read some review by someone complains about the wine selection? LMAO. Wine snobs .. I love wine but they totally miss what makes T Bones special. Been coming here many many years, I know the owners personally, keep up the good work Alan and family!"}
{"text":"Finally pulled off a weekend brunch here on the lake. Nothing too fancy about this place, but if you're there for the right reasons it's a great time. Mellow, on the water, live music, make your own bloody mary bar, and a buffet with more strawberries than I've ever seen a place give out. Sounds funny but it was an enourmous pile that they kept refilling. Gotta say that was yummy. The outdoor deck and bar is great as well, but as others have said it fills up quick so be aware.  If you're looking for a fancy place (is this really a steakhouse?) it's prob not for you, but if you're going for a laid back lake vibe, it will fill all your needs. Bring the boat, have some food, enjoy a bloody, head out for some lake time on the sandbar not too far away, then cruise back for some live music and a nightcap."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and location, but the food is sad, just sad. Won't be coming back. It's fine if you want to enjoy a few beers by the water, but don't come hungry."}
{"text":"You get a great view here and the beer is cold... food leaves a lot of room for improvement. Have eaten here multiple times and the food is mostly all frozen product. The pre formed burger I had today had the tomato slice thicker than the burger patty itself. I would hope for more as well as a fresh made burger for a place that was 16.00 for a burger and a beer pre-tip.  Shrimp is prebreaded frozen, hummus is out of a package.   I like the place but with little effort this place can do sooooo much better than the food they put out. Hopefully management reads these and have more pride in their brand than 2 star overall rating no matter hoe much money is on the bottom line at the end of the day. I am in the same business and understand what it takes to do so , not just someone from the random public .  As an f and b manager I would not be happy at all with the product that exits that kitchen.   Give the place a try. it's a great place for some cold ones on the deck on a nice day and hopefully food improves overtime."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Great patio overlooking lake Wylie."}
{"text":"We stopped here not knowing what to expect and wondered if we were a little under dressed due to the outside of the restaurant. Once inside we saw that we were just fine in our shorts and capris. Cocktails were good but menu is very overpriced. I had the T-bone due to the name and paid $29 for the steak and 1 side. The flavor of the steak was good but a little on the thin side for the price. Service was just ok. They weren't too busy and it seemed the wait staff wanted to hang around and chat with each other. All in all I doubt we will make a trip back here."}
{"text":"Food is okay, but the beer is always good and the location is even better. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This review is ONLY based on drinks!! To us, we ONLY make a stop here when we are out on the boat. It's great being able to dock a boat and come right up! During the summer they have bands that play (every day), it can be a bit loud, but it fits the environment! The drinks are great, and the service is friendly. What more can you want (when that's all you are going there for)  My sister had gotten a drink, and then an employee accidently knocked it over (full). They were all so nice about getting her a replacement very quickly! We will be back in the future (when we are spending a day on the lake), but only for drinks :)"}
{"text":"If you get the chicken club you're okay otherwise  stay away from pretty much anything else but the salads.   We were there tonight and got the food in a somewhat timely fashion the waitress hostess however would not seat us until our entire party of 12 arrived otherwise she would in \"get in trouble\" Which was ridiculous so we had to wait around and not able to sit down.    Then, one person in our party didn't get her chicken sandwich until about 10 minutes later and then got charged an extra dollar for it to be blackened but it wasn't blackened and the manager told her no when she tried to take the dollar off how crazy is that?  I can't believe this place has been around so long and is still in business with such poor management.  Unfortunately this is the only restaurant on the lake and they know it.  Such a shame they should really get their act together."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken nachos piece of chicken was raw order filet tips no mushrooms came with mushrooms ordered a side of sweet potato fries never got tried to be nice to bartender mike he got an attitude and said no way chicken was raw ripped plate out of beef tips manager didn't comp anything but nachos never got corrected order go here from time to time disappointed and bartender was talking bad about situation at bar never tried to correct matters and I didn't ask for anything but order to be corrected"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and the food has been good - the blackened prime rib on Saturday evening is to die for. So we thought we would try the Sunday breakfast buffet and Bloody Mary bar. My advice - go to IHOP or Denny's instead. The breakfast \"buffet\" was no more that a glorified lets-throw-some-typical-mediocre-breakfast-items on a couple of tables and call it  Breakfast Buffet. I went expecting rather a brunch - i.e.: breakfast AND lunch items - after all, they weren't even open until 11 and I'm not much of a breakfast food-type eater anyway. For the price they charged the following was served: fruit (nothing special- cantaloupe, strawberries and honeydew), your typical institutional scrambled eggs - rather plain, bacon, sausage links & patties, biscuits and gravy- thin gravy, short on any sausage mixed in, frenchtoast sticks - which were hard as rocks already and they had only been open 20 minutes! It took a while, and I do mean a WHILE for our server to even show up to begin with and she didn't come back to check on us very often. I had to ASK about the Bloody Mary Bar to which she replied - \"oh yeah it's in the back there\" - this server was NOT really hawking the attributes of the restaurant like one would expect - even when we mentioned it was our first time for the Breakfast buffet. It's an eclectic place, and the food is typically good for the most part - but the same old thing menu. Ribs are good and as I mentioned earlier the prime rib is excellent... but that's probably all we will get there from now on, if we return at all. This could be a weekly haunt for us, but it's only become essentially a once a month thing - and now DEFINITELY not for the breakfast \"buffet\" - I do a better spread at home!"}
{"text":"I have only been one time. Date night and all I could do was look at the animals on the wall and how dusty and dirty they looked. That was 3 years ago and we haven't been back. I drive by there everyday and have no desire."}
{"text":"This place is a great on the lake spot for good beets, scenery and all around stellar bar food. Perfect for grabbing some grub and a beer after a day at the lake or just passing by. My hubs and I just moved to the area and we wanted a place with great views, a chill atmospher, good beer and some yummy eats and it delivered. People are friendly, staff was awesome with good service and it's just a nice environment. I had blackened cod grilled tacos and my hubs had mozz sticks and a quesadilla. All around good spot and I expect this will be a regular of ours in no time."}
{"text":"I visited this place this weekend, already aware of the reviews.  The highlight has got to be the location. By the water, with great parking. The decor was less-than-impressive (borderline tacky - too many stuffed animals).  The food was above-average (especially the Wings and the Golden Fried Shrimp), and the beer was COLD - which was good.  The down-side was definitely the staff (uninterested and not very good overall) and the portions/presentation (our wings had 3 celery sticks and a runny blue-cheese dressing).  Not sure I'm going back at all..."}
{"text":"I feel as though I needed to write this review. This is just tragic that such a prime  location on the lake has terrible food, service, and if that isn't enough, even their drinks are so so...live in town and never been happy with the food. Only up is the location!!! Do not waste $$ on food!! I have had  Ribs: too soft and drenched in BBQ sauce Fish sandwich: fish sticks.. Brown lettuce  Hamburger: dry bun, no flavor.. Wings: the worst, slimy   And others as well..   You've been warned!!  Best and only thing is good music, nice deck w water views and drinks on a summer night or day.. Live music is fun.. Awesome for hanging out w drinks.. Not a food place"}
{"text":"This place would be a great place to eat if they were to remodel it some on  the inside ... I think it smells mildewy.  Food is ok not bad!"}
{"text":"In the year plus since moving to the area we have dined at T-Bones 5 or 6 times.   The first few times we found the food to be decent, but the service to be HORRIBLE.  However...   The last two times we went there, the service was actually FANTASTIC.   The food has been consistently decent each time we have dined.  There are many reviews regarding the decor...   They current owners have done a little work to the outside, but the interior could use some serious updating.   I have never found it to be dirty...  Merely dated.   If you haven't been in a while, give it another try."}
{"text":"Such a disappointing place. Location is terrific and having the outside deck is a plus. BUT the service is extremely slow even if you are at the bar. The food is mediocre. Don't bother!"}
{"text":"We have stopped in two days in a row for lunch. We each had the Tostada appetizer on our first visit. It was delicious. Today we each had the cold salad plate, tuna salad, chicken salad, pasta salad, fruit & crackers. It was delicious and refreshing on a hot day. We really enjoyed the lake view, friendly staff & locals. A big shout out for Carrie the bartender,who was very busy with everything expected of her, but gave prompt service with a smile."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Nothing to die for, but once again our waitress was awesome. She gave us her suggestions on the foods that we had questions on. She also made sure we were taken care of!!"}
{"text":"I love this place right when the sun is going down perfect for a happy hour cocktail I recommend the T-bone steak it was perfectly seasoned"}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place is the view and you can have it for free on the ramp area. Server took forever to realize our existence and when she finally showed up, she was rude to my wife. Food took looong time and quality was low. I wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"I never realized how gross this place was, until I went sober with a group of 13 from work. Yes, it is great to be on the lake, but the place needs some major renovations. The inside smells horrible... like old and soggy and dusty. I ordered a salad with salmon which was disgusting. I think the salmon took on the flavor of the smell of the inside which was nasty. I have enjoyed the chicken quesadilla and drinks before, but that's about it. Actually, I forgot, their Sunday brunch is pretty good and they do a bloody Mary bar that is good too. Don't take a large group because they act like accommodating you is painful. They also took forever when the restaurant seemed fairly dead. They need to remodel and hire a new chef to re-write the menu because you cannot beat the location. They also need more boat slips... it always fills up fast on the weekend!"}
{"text":"It's dirty.  Smells bad.  Sticky tables.  Sticky everything.  Trash around.  Food is good if you're drinking I guess.  If your sober your taste buds react different than these 5 star reviews I can only assume come from drinkers.  Friends of people that work there or friends of the owner.   The place is nasty and I hate that I live by lake Wylie and this nasty scuzzy hole is all there is on the lake.  I can't believe the health department hasn't shut it down."}
{"text":"Nice night for a ride across the border but sadly that place just sucks. I was better when it was the Hungry Fisherman like 25 years ago."}
{"text":"We had so much fun going to watch the Java Band here I can't wait to go back. Great atmosphere and the food and drinks were awesome!"}
{"text":"So first off we had 9 people with a baby and they would not let us sit together at a table outside because they said we had too many people, and they couldnt even sit us next to each other, so half our party had to sit on the other side of the patio. So as soon as we sat down we asked our waitress if she could bring an avocado out as soon as possible for the baby so that she wouldn't cry. It still took about 10 minutes before she brought one out for us, even after we reminded her. my Mother in law ordered a margarita with no salt, and when she got it, it had to have been the saltiest Margarita we have ever tasted. We let the waitress know, and she said she would bring another one out for us, and that took her another 15 minutes to bring that out. I ordered wings which turned out to be dry rub wings,and I am not a fan of dry rub wings ( I am still not sure if the menu even says they are dry rub wings, because i looked at the menu online and no where does it say dry rub wings but im not sure if the actual menu at the restaurant said it or not) Since i wasn't sure if I just ordered the wrong kind of wings, I just asked her if she could bring me a side of wing sauce so I could just dip them in there instead of sending them back. It took so long for her to bring it out every single person was already done with their meal, we also had to have 2 people get up to ask again if they were bringing me sauce. I am pregnant and having to wait that long for food is not very fun esp when everyone was already done eating and then they had to wait for me. I really hope that was jut an off day for the waitress because we were really really disappointed with our service, but it was such a pretty place to sit outside to eat. Not sure we will be back for a while."}
{"text":"Drake is the coolest!!!! He got my Long Islandsss served just like I like it and my food was delicious. I had the grilled chicken sandwich with bacon and pasta salad. Excellent price for such good food. We sat outside in the evening. The view is the lake is so peaceful. When I come to SC on the weekend this will be my hangout spot. Only thing not so good is the bathrooms are not clean. Drake is the coolest waiter I ever had and once you meet him you won't forget him. :)  I'll be back soon to hear the live band play."}
{"text":"A great little place on the lake. A spectacular view and great food and drinks. I've heard negative things about this place but I decided to try it for myself and I'm so glad I did. The wait staff is attentive and the food came out quickly and very nice. It's not a five star place but I would say it's at least a five star dive."}
{"text":"This place has such potential but I believe they heavily rely on the fact that they are the only bar/restaurant on the lake. The only reason why I keep coming back is because it's fun to drive the boat there and back. I wouldn't mind going to T-Bones for a beer and its atmosphere. As far as food go please do not anticipate anything fancy.   My first time there I order a shrimp salad. Not only did I wait an hour long to find out my waitress forgot to put in my order then when it came out I had two shrimps on it only. The worst part was when the bill came out it was nearly $20 for the salad and I didn't even order beer or soda. If another restaurant opened up on Lake Wylie these guys would be hurting for business."}
{"text":"Love love this place! A great place to hang out on the deck in beautiful weather with friends, listen to good music Mike Faulkenberry & the whiskey Prophets (Ashley Baxter lead singer... They are Aaaaamazing!!!! You get great food served by awesome staff there. It's a great setting almost gives you a beach feel. HEY just GO! Enjoy"}
{"text":"We were overall pleased with our meal. We walked right in and got a seat which was a pleasant surprise on a Saturday night.  They were pretty busy with a few large parties and the entire staff was running around to make sure everyone was taken care of.  All staff members were extremely friendly and had no problem catering to a food allergy at our table.  The atmosphere and menu are very kid friendly as well.  The food was delicious, particularly the seared ahi tuna appetizer.  Our kids loved eating by the water, and the highlight of their night was paying 25 cents to feed the ducks by the dock.  No doubt a great family-friendly restaurant for a fun night out!"}
{"text":"Food is not good. Being on the lake is great. Would not go back bc of the food. Food was not warm. Flavor was not good. I do not recommend going here."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and had heard to try t bones on the lake. Ordered the \"world famous\" full rack of ribs. It was obvious the ribs had been cooked the day before and had been sitting in the refrigerator or freezer. They were cold, the sauce was cold. Seems they tried to throw them back on the grill to give it a smoky flavor...failed miserably. Not sure how any kitchen would feel comfortable with sending that out to a customer. Must not really care. Only reason for two stars is my wife's Gouda chicken was good."}
{"text":"One star!  Let me begin by saying I've been coming to this restaurant since it opened, sometime in early 90's.  It appears that the joint hasn't been remodeled or thoroughly cleaned since opening day.  The place is absolutely filthy.  Really had a hard time not just walking out, but I wasn't alone so I stuck it out.  Terrible atmosphere.  Very musty, all the decorations appear to be from the early 90's.  The windows are dirty.  The floors are dirty.  The doors are sticky.  You can tell that the place is wiped down but never deep cleaned.    So now to the food.  I had a Carolina burger. It was tasteless, unseasoned, and poorly made.  Tasted nothing like a Carolina burger should.  The slaw had carrots in it which is weird on a burger and I've never seen carrots in homemade burger cole slaw.  The chili was tasteless.  The bun was tasteless.  Bad all the way around.  The burger was low grade meat, more suited for McDonalds and truthfully tasted worse than a McDonalds burger but cost me 10.00.  What a sham.  That burger cost them 2.00 and they charged 9.99.  Which I'll gladly pay for a fresh ground beef patty.  Pitiful excuse for a restaurant. No leadership in this place.  I really don't understand this business plan because they are adjacent to some of the highest value homes in Charlotte.  Just clean the place and serve fresh food.  I'll never return."}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to like T-Bones. I've passed it a few times and always wanted to check it out. I always saw the huge patio and the view of the lake and thought it'd be so nice to go to on a sunny day. Unfortunately it's not one of my favorites.  To start, the hostess' were not very welcoming when we walked in. I felt like we were inconvenniencing them by coming to spend money at their restaurant. She was not very nice and before even greeting us, she bluntly told us that the patio was closed and we couldn't sit out there. We kind of ignored it and moved on and walked in. We walked past another girl who I couldn't really tell if she worked there or not but I assumed she did since she was just standing by the host station and as we walked past her she just stared at us again making us feel like we were not welcome. No smile, no hi, nothing. So at this point we were a little taken back but continued in. We went to the bar, yet again to be greeted angrily and rudely by the bartender. (at this point we should have left but we really wanted to see the view) She asked my boyfriend what he wanted completely ignoring me because as I already know, I look young but regardless if someone is standing at your bar, you approach them regardless (after years of bartending, I've learned this and would hope any bartender would do the same). So after flagging her down I ordered my drink and before I could even finish, she demanded my ID. I obviously gave it to her and received my drink, no apologies from the bartender.   We then saw people outside so figured the deck was, in fact, not closed. We went outside and found out that we could sit outside with our cocktails and if we wanted, order food inside and then bring it out ourselves. Fine, thats understandable. So thats what we did. We got wings and the hummus dip appetizer. Food was ok, nothing exciting, nothing terrible, definitely not worth the negativity we had to go through to get it.   Not sure if I will be returning to T-Bones. I want to because of the views, but I'd rather be treated better at a restaurant that does not have the same views."}
{"text":"There's a reason this place only averages 2.5 stars.  This is what I consider a boaters paradise..... It is where boaters come to watch and to be seen. It is common to have quite a few beers while watching the boats try to aimlessly dock in a narrow slip with amateur boaters.  I will refer to this event as the bumper boats at T-Bones.  I am perplexed at the statement that they take reservations, but they do not do call ahead seating.  Tonight, was only a 5 min wait, so I was able to entertain myself by watching two boaters trying to dock their boat.  (very cheap entertainment if you ask me)  Now for the T-Bones review. I have been craving oysters lately, and prefer Oyster Rockefeller, but since this was not offered, I opted for the Angels on Horseback...it is bacon wrapped oysters deep fried on a bed of rice w/ a side of oriental sauce.  I give this a 1/5 stars,yes one star.  The bacon was burnt (black) and the rice was very dry and hard.  The sauce did not really help, but it did add flavor to a very bland dish.  Definitely not worth $9.99 ( I have added a picture)   Now for for the Burgers / Chicken sandwiches.  The burger was very nice, juicy, the provolone cheese was properly melted and the bacon was cooked perfectly.  The Chicken Sandwich, which I requested plain, was very juicy, moist, and without any extra help, from condiments, lettuce etc, was very tasty and flavorful.    Now you may ask,how can bacon be burnt black and then be cooked perfectly at the same time.....remember that one was on my appetizer (burnt) and the other was on the hamburger.  Our server was very friendly, prompt with the drink refills and attentive, all the way up until we were ready to leave......after she took our plates away, it was 5 minutes before she returned with the check.   She apologized, but by that time.....I was ready to go!  Here's the breakdown of my rating:  Location: 4/5 Stars   It is right on the water at Buster Boyd Bridge.  Atmosphere: 3/5 Stars   Needs to be updated somewhat. Original posters and calendars from the 80's, even a John Wayne poster clock in the hallway.  Service: 3/5  Just meh.  Parking 4/5  Has the boat landing area to also park in.  Boat Parking: 4/5 Plenty of boat slips available  Food: 3/5 Good, not great, a little pricey for the quality of the food.  Entertainment 5/5 Watching amateur boaters park near expensive boats = PRICELESS!  Just remember what the fellow Yelpers Yelp, do not go here for the food, but just enjoy a few cold beers and enjoy the scenery.  NCFoodGuy"}
{"text":"Went for brunch and it was AMAZING! Staff was great and the view was awesome! The food was amazing also! The spinach artichoke dip was to die for! This is our new spot for Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"Giving it 3 stars for the outdoor area.  The only food I've had is their spinach quesadilla which was okay.  Nice place to grab a drink and listen to some live music. outdoor on the lake."}
{"text":"T Bones is quite a busy place during the summer months, considering it's located right on Lake Wylie. The food here is above average & the scenery is well worth a patio seating.  I don't prefer eating inside here, not because it's bad, but mainly due to how great the patio seating is. The inside is just like your normal steakhouse setting, with steer skulls and the big & bold atmosphere. They don't do anything particularly unique or intriguing inside, but it's not so bad. But if you head here during a nice night, then wait for a patio seat. This area is always packed, mainly because you're sitting right over the water. They also have a boat dock so you can watch the boaters stroll up to grab some din din. You may have to wait for a patio seat, but it's well worth it.  The food here isn't anything spectacular, but it's definitely above average. They have all your steak specialties, duh...the name, along with some other good stuff you'd see on most steakhouse menus. People flock to this place on weekend nights, along with most week nights, so you know the food has to be good to keep them coming back. And while you'll spend a decent chunk of change, it's well worth it if you're sitting outside with a view.  T Bones on the Lake is great for a spring or summer night, when it isn't too hot & you're looking for good food. They have a good menu, but the main attraction is the lake. So if you're in the area or have a boat, pull up to the dock & find a patio seat."}
{"text":"The worst service ... most rude management ... and overpriced food I've ever eaten ... Wouldn't recommend ... only thing good this place has going for it is the location on the lake!"}
{"text":"First of all if the service is very slow takes forever to get a cheeseburger on the cheeseburger hit the table it was room temperature and it was very plain the views nice but you're just paying for the view you not paying for the services the food anything.. I will never come back to this restaurant again unless the owner died and I came to pay respects to make sure he doesn't open another restaurant again"}
{"text":"Great place to pull up to in your boat and get a drink on the deck and watch people navigate the traffic jam of finding a boat slip on a busy summer day. The food is ok. They market it as a Texas place and while the memorabilia decor inside is true Texan the food is only ok. All in all not a bad place to hang out on a summer day."}
{"text":"T-Bones on the Lake   The name sounds \"Elite\" but nope it's a basic restaurant with basic bar/pub foods. The wine selection is very basic & I was disappointed. If they add local wines to the menu that may enhance the experience. The service is mediocre.   Sitting on the lake sipping & watching the water view is relaxing. If you're coming for the food DO NOT EXPECT anything but bar food.   The Top Shelf Margarita was good ~~ was"}
{"text":"Let's get it out of the way - the food here is not so great. Nothing so terrible it has scarred my memory but if I never ate here again I wouldn't be fussed. We have tried various plates and the best sampled was the popcorn shrimp and the appetizer sampler. The salads have come with slightly wilted lettuce and browning avocado.  The sandwiches are average.   Obviously I don't come here for the food. I come for the sunshine and friendly wait staff. Also to visit my various duck and fish friends that I have made by throwing them my leftover crackers from the deck. The deck they have out back is perfect for enjoying a beer with friends. Or, if you are brave, a top shelf margarita. I only ordered it once so either I got a heavy handed bartender or it is how they normally make the drink but after just one I was pretty relaxed and glad I wasn't driving.   I would recommend coming here just for drinks on the lake and maybe an appetizer. I haven't tried their steaks but if you can't provide a fresh salad I don't see a reason to gamble on the higher priced items."}
{"text":"Service was good, but food NOT.  You don't realize how awful the food really is until about 30 minutes after you have eaten it.  5 of us eat there tonight, we each had different items, pasta, fish and chips, potato skins, combination of vegetable sides, a sandwich, and other items.   Everything was GREAZY and salty.  But you don't realize how much grease until 15-30 minutes after eating when your skin gets oily, you feel sludgy, thirsty, and loose your energy.  I don't know what grease or ingredients they use, but it's terrible.  We all went home after and didn't feel like doing anything after this. I've been there before for beer on the deck, the beer is good, but don't eat the food.   Contrary to many of the other reviews, the service was very good.  Meghan was our waitress."}
{"text":"Ok Food, nothing spectacular. Good casual food on the lake. Would visit again, but average."}
{"text":"Bad food, bad service and a pushy bartender. This is the only place on Lake Wylie that you can have a drink and eat. I have given this place over 6 tries and it sinks, there is no saving it. Last trip was my last. Pushy  bartender stuck a drink in front of me that I did not order. She was totally obnoxious.  I never have had a good meal here and everything is overpriced. We went on a Friday night to hear their band and have a drink. What a joke. I have never seen so many mentality deprived people and the band could not carry a tune in a bucket."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the Steel Creek area of Charlotte and were riding around hunting for a place to eat dinner when we passed T-Bones Steakhouse and Saloon on 49 and saw a sign that said all you can eat shrimp.  We decided to give it a try.  From the moment we pulled in the parking lot it felt all wrong.  The long wooden covered walkways to the door were weird and felt SO old school.  Then when we get to a door, we enter a long waiting area with weird art and knick knacks everywhere to look at while you wait for a table.  This was a Tuesday night and there were very few people there so we walked on through to the main entrance door where we encountered a huge polar bear in a glass case.  I guess some people like this sort of decoration... but I think polar bears should not be in glass cases and it makes me sad to see that sort of thing.  But, I went on in to the cavernous building to be greeted by an older man that seemed to be one of the managers if not an owner.  He was nice enough but felt very seventies to me; like he's had a very colorful, entertaining past in his youth and now leads a comfortable life complete with gold chains and tight fitting jeans.  The booths are fixed to the wall, meaning if you're fat, you're gonna be very tightly squeezed to get in or out of the booth.  The server seemed used to making her money off the alcohol sales, so since we didn't drink, we rarely saw her.  The food was average at best.  Fried popcorn shrimp, baked potato, cole slaw...  very usual and unfortunately, not super tasty.  The best part of my meal was the loaded baked potato and the sweet tea...  I was sad when both were gone.  Looking around the place you can tell that if you enjoy rowdy drunken (Jimmy Buffet type) fun on a river then it's the spot to be at during the summer months, complete with boat docks, a huge outdoor bar area and tons of space inside to hold lots of drinkers.  The place reminded me of an old saloon on Gunsmoke with 2 levels and lots of hallways darting off that you couldn't see where they went.  I kept expecting to see a \"working\" girl leading a man down one of those halls.  None of it said \"tasty food\" or \"comfort\" to me...  the whole place felt like those walls have seen way too much action over the years.  The energy of the place was not enjoyable to me; I will not be back."}
{"text":"Great live music last Friday night, July 31st, with Richburg Road.  Good dance music, excellent play list, good tunes to just sit back and listen to, also.  Made for a fun evening."}
{"text":"What's better than fresh seafood, warm weather and lake view?? This place was heaven, right on the water, outdoor seating, great drinks and good seafood.  Being from out of town we had no idea what to expect and found the spot on Yelp.  The service was far from being A1, slow and way too laid back.   This place seemed like a hidden gem on the lake but the horrid customer service well lack there of, makes me not want to go back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. The ratings are accurate. Mediocre food, place smelled \"off\" and looked dirty. There's got to be a better place to eat on the water. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Go here for the lake scenery-- not the food. Very mediocre. Nothing special. I had the smothered steak and would not get it again.  The inside is fun with signs and trinkets. The outside patio is nice to sit out and watch the lake. The waitresses were friendly."}
{"text":"I just noticed the time and they close in four minutes let me tell you they should have closed years ago and they should not bother opening tomorrow. I can't believe even a low-level restaurant can ruin an easy grilled chicken salad. The raspberry vinaigrette tasted like something out of one of those mayonnaise packets that you rip open. The chicken was grizzly bland and flavorless. The turtle that we saw in the pond as we were walking in probably would have tasted better. I was not the only patron who appeared to have trouble with their order. I saw two ladies at another table send back two plates of food. Simply because of the view I would only go there for a drink. Even the menus felt dirty and sticky and that should have been my first clue. I was afraid to order another beer because of the scowl on the barmaids face I thought maybe she was going to yell at me. My pitbull has a softer look on her face. If you like bad food you're in for a heckuva time."}
{"text":"Rookie operation all around. So-so food, Less than so-so service. Smelly and generally sub-par. Go to drink on the deck ONLY."}
{"text":"Looking for a NC it SC craft beer. You won't find it here. Terrible beer selection. Bud Sam Adams Land Shark aren't real beer. You can do better or just take handouts from the distributors."}
{"text":"Wanted to check this place out, never been.  First impressions horrible.  Not a very \"welcoming\" place.  When I pulled up looked like all the cooks in the kitchen were outside smoking a cigarette.  By the looks of it I doubt they washed their hands.  Outside seating is seat yourself.  I sat for about five minutes, every sever outside just looked at me and finally I had to ask if it was serve yourself Thursday.  Only had one beer and left.  Did not want to eat there."}
{"text":"The waitresses are extremely rude and the food is cold and something you might find at a fast food joint. Don't waste your time unless you're out on the lake and have no other option."}
{"text":"Everyone at our table loved our dishes which included the grilled chicken, tender ribs, and calabash shrimp. Yummy!"}
{"text":"The view! Love to watch the boats on the lake-have to be seated in the deck. Why anyone eats inside is a mystery to me. This place is all about location-you do not come here for the food. The food is okay-not horrible-the salads are good. You come here to view the lake, people watch, and drink.   Always meet fun, talkative people. Very casual. Car Parking lot is good and the boat dock seems adequate. The kids like the ducks and turtles that hang around. They have pellet machines for a quarter to feed the rascals."}
{"text":"The food is not great.  The service is hit or miss.  It is however a great place to go on an afternoon for drinks and appetizers.   Bring out of state visitors who enjoy the novelty of the patio.  Would not consider this place without company.  We would not go on a weekend  night especially during the hot summer months...young kids meat market....not interested in that atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is a waste of time. Had enough of the crappy customer service, food and management to ever come back again. If only Sweetwater could takeover their location."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! Awesome view right on the lake, delicious food EVERY time (no matter what you order, and great wait staff!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is dirty, the service is poor and the food is sub-par. The only redeeming factor is the deck."}
{"text":"Great place on the water in South Carolina. My wife and I are from Illinois, we visit South Carolina to be with family, every time we visit we stop at T-Bones for some drinks. We love the old decor with something interesting to see at every turn. The outside patio is amazing in the summertime."}
{"text":"Man, if there was another game on the lake, these guys may actually step up their game. Food is average. Inside is dark and dreary. Outside is ok. Love the lake fire though."}
{"text":"As everyone that goes to TBones remarks, WHY DON'T THEY UPDATE THE DECOR AND MENU IN THE WINTER WHEN IT IS SLOW???  The only draw TBones has is the location (only place on lake really - that is a shame) and the bartenders who do a great job of serving from dilapidated old bars and a crowd in warm weather.  The deck is great, but needs to be scraped and repained, updated.  The furniture on the deck is the cheapest they can find, and is just uncomfortable and always broken. The stools make you sit way lower than the bar and you feel like a 5 year old - they weren't made for this.  They are breaking too.The horrible 'decorative' paint job and poly on the bar and railings from 20+ years ago is peeling off and needs to be removed.  Looks like the removed a lot from the interior ceiling of deck bar, which is great because it was nasty hanging over where drinks were made.  I know they probably can't expand deck, but no reason they cannot update it in the current footprint.  Food just isn't great, never has been.  Work on the menu and find people committed to putting out good product, revamp the old, tired decor and clean up the restrooms, and you won't have a slow season..."}
{"text":"Great food, live music and its all on the lake. Be sure to give this place a chance and always go at the evening."}
{"text":"1 star for the view of the lake and 1 star for the food and drinks. We sat on the outside patio and everything was sticky. It took the waiter 15 minites to come and take our drink order only to have those drinks come out 30 minutes later (although he did apologize) and tables that came in after us had their drinks in 5 minutes or so."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Friday afternoon and it was pretty busy but we were sat immediately.  The decor is rustic but the location is where this place shines. It's right on the water with plenty of boat parking!  It's also right next to the boat launch. There is outside seating available.  We had the potato skins app.  They were good but not awesome. Plenty of sour cream was provided.  I had the Flounder sandwich with fries.  It was also good... there was only one piece of fish but it pretty much covered the sub roll shaped bun. I wish it was a bit thicker.  The bread was quite fresh.  Tarter sauce was tasty and I would guess to be made in-house.  My brother had the parmesan crusted chicken breast with fries and he said it was great!  Our server did an excellent job... we had been outside and were parched and it was warn inside the restaurant so we were hitting the water pretty hard but she kept us hydrated ;-)  We will definitely return the next time we visit Lake Wylie."}
{"text":"Damn it! If I win the lottery this is the first place I'm going to buy and turn around... like this could be one of those places they feature on Drive in, Dinners, and Dives. I think they make so much on beer sales they don't really have to make good food. It's one of the few places on the lake so...scenery is nice though."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. French toast was like rocks, eggs and sausage were cold. We were told they would be putting out fresh food, that was cold too! $30 for two for brunch, not worth it."}
{"text":"Had the chicken salad and lettuce was wilted, fruit was  room temp.  Chicken wings where not hot.  Husband got a sandwich and lettuce had dirt on it. Was never washed. Wow, the location is great food is crap.."}
{"text":"Great location, especially in good weather.  The food on the other hand is a disappointment.  The service isn't great either.  Seems like a waste to have a prime location without good food."}
{"text":"This place is truly horrid. Just not my kind of place. I went as part of a group so did not really have a choice. It was hot - very uncomfortable - inside. It was loud - very loud - as usual. The staff is very friendly so that's why they get 2 stars. The owners do nothing to attempt fixing it up.   The food isn't very good at all. The chicken nachos we ordered I have renamed the Waldo Chicken Nachos as in - where's Waldo?!  We went into the parrot bar after our quick apps and a live band was playing. The live band was very good but I never have, nor never will understand why small places have the bands play their music so loud. I mean incredibly loud.   Maybe I'm just an old \"fuddy duddy\" but how can that be enjoyable?  You cannot easily carry on a conversation with the people you are with.   Each time I go here I swear it will be the last. How are there no other restaurants on Lake Wylie?!"}
{"text":"Where to begin.....The only reason to go to this place is the view. To sit out by the water and have a beer. The food is the worst. You would think being the only restaurant on the lake you would feel some since of obligation to have great food. McDonald's is five star dinning compared to this place. It really ails me that this place sucks. On the weekend your on the lake, you want to pull your boat up and go in and have a great meal and a few beers. Not happening."}
{"text":"Eat before you go, nice deck and beer is sometimes cold..good location, really wish this place was better."}
{"text":"The food is awful. Drinks are weak. Service is terrible. Sunday brunch is good & there is a bloody mary bar."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place not only because it's minutes away from my house but for the scenery you can go on the back patio and eat while watching the view of the lake its a different kind of scenery i will say im not a fan of the food there its regular bar food i always get the same thing when i go which is the cat fish dinner that you can really split with two people its alot of food! The drink in my picture i was really excited about because it was so pretty in color but nothing to brag about almost a little watered down. I reccommend this place for going to hang out with friends for drinks maybe or a loved one just for the patio  on the lake in back its a great vibe! Which i believe they shut that part of the restraunt down when the cold weather starts to kick in which makes sense. Also when you walk in i like the big scary bear in the glass case you see in the pictures as well makes for a good picture."}
{"text":"Had two very disappointing dinners here. Although the location and view of the lake is 5 stars, the food is not. I went with a group of four. Our waitress was nice but not very professional. One of the first things we spotted was a large cock roach crawling across the floor. We expected this to be taken care of after telling the waitress but it was not. I am not so sure where that nasty bug ended up. For about $17-$19 a a dinner our plates were very sad looking. Chicken was dry and the portions were tiny! Going to t bones you may be thinking oh! T bone steaks! Nope...no where to be found on the menu. Mostly everything is fried! After finally receiving our bread and butter at the same time as our dinner....?? We dug right in. After one person took a bite the sour faces were hard to miss!! After investigating the bread and butter we realized that there was something seriously wrong with the butter! It tasted something like chlorine/really old water that has been sitting in a dirty sink for a long time. It was terrible. After kindly explaining this to my waitress she again was not very professional. She was like oh okay. And took it from us. She offered free desert which we did not want because everything else was terrible. I asked if they tried the butter in the kitchen and she said \"oh no...we won't try it\" which makes me wonder how many other poor folks had to taste it that evening! We will NOT be back for dinner. The only reason I would go back is to sit at the bar on the back deck and have a drink. This place has so much potential! The wrong people are running it. Such a waste!!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had the nacho appetizer, shrimp and the fishing chips.   The shrimp in the fish and chips were just terrible. The nachos were pretty good but not good enough to go back.   The staff was very slow and our waitress disappeared so it took forever to order.   Two stars instead of one for the decent nachos."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere! It's awesome to look at the lake on a summers evening! I always get a steak or a burger and it's always really good. I just wish there was more outdoor seating"}
