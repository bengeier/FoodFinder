{"text":"Eat here at least twice a week. Great little spot in the mall love the ladies that work there and they probably have the best homemade salsas on this side of town!!! Don't change a thing."}
{"text":"Delicious! Was craving some authentic Mexican and saw the reviews so I thought I'd try it.  It's in the food court in the Paradise Valley mall but well worth it!  Had the #15 steak tacos with rice and beans.  All perfect.  My favorite salsa was the avocado.  And less than $8.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a little gem in pv mall! I've eaten here 3x & have never been disappointed. Family owned- adorable sweet girl in front. Free chips & to die for avocado salsa! Just tried the corditas- & even living in Phx for 30+ years - had never tried. Delicious! Taking the second 1 home to my daughter!"}
{"text":"The food was  nothing to rave about. The rice was greasy and dry, appeared to be old. The beans were very bland. I got the chicken flautas plate. If there was an ounce of chicken used between all five fried rolled corn tortillas, I'd be surprised. They were just a little bigger than a pencil. Add a drink and you have a 9.5 dollar disappointment....ugh."}
{"text":"This is a good place to pick up some asada dishes. I'm not crazy about Mexican as a rule but this was a good experience."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken taco salad-$7 and change. 

Standard taco salad made very quickly with delicious and fresh tasting ingredients.
Service was polite.

A nice option in a mall food court..."}
{"text":"Who knew the mall could have something so yummy!!
I recommend the avocado salsa and the sopas. I usually get a steak and an el pastor. But the nachos are yummy too. 
There are roasted jalape√±os near the salsa. I try to limit myself to three (trying to share, it is difficult). 
Everything I have had is good! And the girl at the counter is super nice!"}
{"text":"Definitely a little gem. I absolutely love the chimichanga with extra cream. This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant. The lady the owns it is really nice and always remembers my order. The cooks are also really nice.. Five stars well earned."}
{"text":"I work in the mall, so I'm very frequent here. I order the #12 \"Street Tacos\". I always get steak with flour tortillas. These tacos are delicious every time. The meat is juicy and flavorful, not dry with no taste. The tortillas (flour) are soft and cooked to perfection, not dry and flakey. They have a good selection of salsas (Hot, Mild, Green, and Guac) with free chips with your meal. They have Mexican bottled Coke (yes, it tastes different) which is a plus. 

Service is nice and they make sure everything is up to their customer's satisfaction."}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic Mexican food.  Don't let the fact that it's in a food court fool you.  Delicious!  A must have if you are in the area or if you're craving an authentic Mexican bite.  Try out their salsa, too!"}
{"text":"No joke if you are looking for some delicious and might I shockingly add authentic Mexican food, than look no further than this unassuming gem located in the food court at Paradise Valley Mall. 

I ordered the sopes al pastor and they were as good as I would get at my favorite little stand in San Jose del Cabo. The sopes were perfectly prepared, and the al pastor was some of the best I have ever had; juicy and falvorful, and all for $6.99. The rest of their menu looked delicious and I frankly can't wait to come back and try more!

They offer a selection of free salsas and chips, I am a fan of the avocado salsa, and I really loved that they offered a few super spicy options (beware, they are pretty spicy) as well as roasted jalapenos and pickled carrots and onions! 

100% worth the 5 stars and truly highly recommended!"}
