{"text":"Waitress was polite and very patient considering that I was very aggravated however this does not improve the quality of the food. I have grown up in Miami and have tasted Caribbean food and I must say that they have missed the mark because the food here was horrible and you should have void it at all cost because they have truly earned the 85% rating from the health department. I tried to give everybody the benefit of the doubt but this place should not be in business"}
{"text":"We had lunch today in hopes of an improvement from our last experience. Unfortunately it was even worse. The chicken was really off! We're convinced it was at least a day old and microwaved to a point of dusty and powder dry in my mouth. We told the server and she just gave us a blank look. The place was totally full with 6 people. They should just bow out gracefully and shut it down. The question is, what is really going on? Two words sums up this place, don't go!"}
{"text":"The Anthony's Caribbean sauce is so addictive!!! You've been warned! So yes...that means I have some at home. I work within walking distance so I stop by often. I've tried a number of items on the menu. Favorite sides are the macaroni and cheese as well as the potato salad. Up to this point I've enjoyed all the meat entrees. I usually get chicken (for the sauce) but ribs or ox tails on occasion. The staff is cool. I enjoy the banter with the Manager...I guess since he's always there. But it's nice to go where the food is good and you get to see a friendly smile."}
{"text":"First time! Very good service! High score of sanitation rating very clean! We are going back soon!!"}
{"text":"The food was disgusting... Rice was overccooked and mushy, Mac and cheese was just not good, the curry chicken was like soup, and the chicken patty has barely any filling in it. The chicken patty was the only thing 1/2 decent the filling it did have was pretty good. If the bad food wasn't enough they forget to give me my chicken patty which I am not sure how since there were no customers and it was very slow. I had to drive back to her my patty since I was charged for it. The food was disgusting I will never again give them my business."}
{"text":"I have no idea if this place is good. Every time I go the place is closed! Yes, I check their website. One time they decided to close early like as soon as we walked in. They had 2 hours til closing. Second time today. Guess I need to get my Groupon money back. At this point I have concerns about the freshness of their food"}
{"text":"You  kidding me this is what Charlotte has to offer for Caribbean food, I'm so disappointed. I'm Haitian and was born and raised in south Florida, so I know alot about Caribbean food. I'm sorry Charlotte but this is not Caribbean food at all."}
{"text":"A nice quick little place, if you don't know much about carribbean food i would steer clear, and the portions are a but small but i found them to be enough."}
{"text":"The food was great! The prices just right and the service outstanding!  I would definitely recommend this place for lunch or dinner, dine in or take out."}
{"text":"This is not your authentic Caribbean cuisine.  I ordered curry chicken and barley tasted curry.  I could not even finish the meal.  They are very nice but in my opinion it's not true Caribbean food."}
{"text":"They say you get what you pay for....and sometimes you get more! My wife and ate at Anntony's today on a whim and thank goodness we did!  We started with a Chicken Pattie which was just spicy enough to get my mouth watering and then i got the Goat Curry and Callaloo Greens (wonderfully vinegary), wonderful aromas, tender goat and once again a perfect blend of spices. My wife got the Pork Roti with plantains and while mine was wonderful I almost wish I'd gotten what she did. It is rich and savory and was simply a treat! The owner delivered my food and asked us how everything was on our way out and to please come back and tell our friends, no worries there! We will be back, so much more I want to try now! We spent a grand total of $22, now that is getting what you pay for tenfold, lol!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here it was so good. I went yesterday and the food tasted off. They were out of stock of most things we wanted.   Not sure what the deal was; but my stomach has been tore up every since I left.    Hopefully this improves soon. I don't think I'll ever visit again tho :("}
{"text":"Wonderful staff. Relaxed environment. Tasty food and reasonable prices for lunch.  The sauce is so good I bought one to take home girl."}
{"text":"I'm a Jamaican and at first I was a bit skeptical about the Anntony's special sauce, but I really enjoyed it. I had the island wings and I bought a couple of patties. The food was really good, and so was the experience. The waiter there, I believe his name was kamal was great also, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love the chicken at Anntony's.  Its a favorite lunch spot of mine.  I'm trying to find the Anntony's sauce in the grocery store so I can try to duplicate it at home."}
{"text":"Nasty can't even begin to describe the way this food tasted! Horrible don't ever go there the chicken had a terrible taste the macaroni was Horrible! Looked like it was just soaking in water you couldn't even taste the cheese. Candied yams was embarrassing it was out of a can and burnt and tasted old! A good waitress was the only good thing about this restaurant. The ribs had no meat and was smothered in that nasty sauce which the waitress said was vinegerett but I love vinegar they are giving Caribbean food a bad name I'd the Jamaicans ate here they would probably cut the cook! If I could give it no stars I would they should not be in business and with a score of 85!!! I couldn't get that nasty taste out of my mouth!!!"}
{"text":"The service was very friendly and helpful. Casual place so nothing fancy as far as decor but who cares when the jerk sauce is so darn delicious?? We tried several items including the chicken and ribs and even bought the sauce to make at home. If you love Jamaican flavors check this place out. I especially loved the patties!"}
{"text":"We always do take out, so I can tell you that the food is consistently delicious. I do think that the staff are \"on island time\" because they take their time and do not rush. My favorite is the curry chicken with greens and black beans. My partner likes the ribs with slaw and black beans. Good food, large portions, reasonable prices... keeps me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"It's not a Caribbean restaurant, it's \"soul fusion\".  If you're looking for Jamaican food, don't come here. Go to Island Grocery & restaurant [google it].  The greens were a little too tangy, the rice and peas was more like rice and beans.  They said they're known for the sauce, that too was too tangy.  The cornbread just fell apart, but that was the best part. $11 dinner, overpriced for serving.  The chef and cashier were lovely, I asked them for the best of what they had and this was it.  My taste buds prefer less soul and more Caribbean. Tried it, doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"First time today and it was awesome! Wings are falling off the bone and really tender and sweet potato fries are great! Will be back to try something else soon!"}
{"text":"Quarter chicken on the lunch menu was the best chicken I've ever had.. well cooked and moist. Also tried the cream soda which was great"}
{"text":"Honestly, how does this place stay in business? they do not sell plantains, which is a staple food in the islander/Caribbean culture.  The rice & peas are bland.  The Calypso greens are too vinegary. The prices are too high & portions are small.  I will NOT return to this place & I do NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend's dad gave us the 2011 Entertainment Guide book for Christmas and, slowly, we have been exploring new-to-us-restaurants with our coupons. His dad also has the same book and used his coupon for Anntony's yesterday for lunch. His dad is not one to call us and rave about a place, but he said we needed to check it out. We checked out the menu that was advertised in the book to see if the food matched our tastes. I was excited to see they offered Caribbean Crab Cakes so we headed out to Anntony's for dinner.  When we walked in at 6:45, there was not a single person in the restaurant. We sat down and were handed menu's that differed from the menu in the entertainment book. I checked their menu on-line after dinner and found it to be correct with the menu at the restaurant though. The menu consisted of all chicken and some pork options. I was really disappointed to find that no crab-cake listed. In addition, their menu did not supply a description of the entrees, but it did for their sides. I found the menu very underwhelming.   I ordered the chicken wing dinner that was tossed in a special Caribbean sauce with their black beans and mac and cheese. My boyfriend ordered the chicken breast with collard greens and rice. The wings were okay, some were dry and some were not. He said his chicken tasted like it was leftover from lunch and was dry as well. The beans, mac and cheese, and rice were very good though.   Their slogan is \"Don't Worry About Nothin' Mon!\" I WISH! I was very worried while I was dining for the following reasons:  -They had two TVs on that showed depressing world events (Not sure why a restaurant has TVs in it, it's not a bar).  -The server, although very pleasant and sweet, did not have her hair tied back and wore a strapless dress with flip flops. We asked for hot sauce and she brought out a bottle of sauce with out a lid on it. Where was the Health Department when we needed them?  -Why were we the only people in the restaurant???    I can only assume that my boyfriends dad liked the place so much was due to the amount of food you get with the low priced meals and that lunch was a bit fresher than dinner.   I would not recommend this place for dinner. Maybe lunch is better, but the food safety and health issues are a bit concerning."}
{"text":"*Sighs*. I had the oxtail meal with rice and beans and potato salad. The potato salad was delicious I will admit! However, the oxtails were too sweet and chewy as if it didn't cook long enough, also needed salt. I would say at $12 the pricing was great and they gave me enough oxtails for my money. The rice and beans were cooked too long and didn't have any salt AT ALL. Talk about disappointing! I also ordered cocoa bread which I found out was old. I've been here a few times and it's always hit or miss. If ordering to go, I'd say check AND taste your food before you leave."}
{"text":"A friend and I just stopped in for lunch today.  The staff is friendly, but a little disorganized.  The decor is appropriately Caribbean caricature, and the food we had was Fan-F**king-Tastic!    I ordered the combo of rotisserie chicken and cuban pork, with a side of fries (I know, I know, but I was in a fry mood!) and greens.  The pork was good, tender, and well cooked; although I was hoping for pork shoulder, it was pork tenderloin, and the menu should probably clarify that.  Still, very tasty.  The chicken totally blew it away!  It was almost shockingly juicy, very well seasoned, and sauced with a sweet, tangy, and spicy sauce that I would probably drink out of a glass if given the option.  The fries were actually knock-out, and lightly seasoned with jerk spices.  They were thin and crispy, great for sopping up the juices and sauce off the plate.  The greens were good, with a nice vinegar tang.  My friend ordered beans and rice, which he loved.      We had a few Landshark Drafts, and are going back next week to try the oxtail!"}
{"text":"The meat is good.  The sides, not so much.  The service, terrible.  I had the rasta pasta and the black beans.  Others in my party (4 of all altogether) agreed, the sides were mediocre."}
{"text":"The Anntony's Caribbean on Sugar Creek is awesome! Love the food, and the service is great! The owner and staff are really friendly :) I always get the coco bread with a side of plantain and a Vita-Malt :D Great job on the new site, can finally see the new menus online!"}
{"text":"Small no frills establishment with about three tables, a drink cooler and counter with register. We got the largest table to seat 5 and was a bit cramped.   Mac and cheese was good Boneless chicken was okay (it's the normal rotisserie they just pulled out the bone and took off skin, then Poured sauce on it.  Corn bread was good, a bit dry for me.  Curry chicken was great.  Rice and peas were good.  Rasta pasta was simple and light but good.  Yams were canned so we didn't order that.  Sweet tea was not traditional sweet tea.   Overall the food was good. We did hear and see items being put in the microwave, so that was a bit disappointing. Portion sizes were small/average (about an ice cream scoop size). Service was lacking a bit, the server seemed annoyed by my questions about the food and would ask us if we needed anything while sitting at her seat behind the counter."}
{"text":"Wanted some wings and remembered seeing some tasty looking pictures of wings from here.  I ordered the mild jerk island wings, fries and a beef patty.  The food was cooked right then and came out fresh and piping hot.  The wings were saucy, had a lot of flavor, and weren't over-fried, which I hate. Fries were good. The beef patty was delicious and spicy.  The cornbread was the only disappointment on the plate.  I'd definitely return to try other things!"}
{"text":"We only get to come here when we are making a trip to Ikea but we love this place! We usually get the beef patty to start with and we each get an entree but man, the portions are so huge we can probably share one entree between my husband and I.  My husband usually gets the pork chop and I've tried the curry, oxtail, and jerk chicken which are all pretty tasty!  The place is clean and the food is good! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Let's start out by saying I like the food here.  My problem is that the place has gone downhill in the last few years.  Today my wife and i stopped in for a draft beer (they have always had landshark and at least one other beer on tap) and some food but ended up walking out.  We sat ourselves down and then were greeted.  i asked what was on tap and the waitress read the menu which I know is not correct, the beer selection on there hasn't been right in years.  So I got up and went to the bar to look myself, it was some copper beer (NOT Old Mecklenburg).  Anyway, we both ordered that, a few minutes later the waitress comes back to tell us that both taps are dry.  Ok, it takes a lot for me to walk out of a place but this was it for me.  I will probably go back and try again but be warned, it looks like this place sadly might be in trouble."}
{"text":"First time eating here as i love carribean food. Well lets just say i wont be back. When i saw asians at the register and a white woman cooking the food i should have left then. This restaurant is not authentic as i know how authentic carribean food is prepared and taste. Ordered the curry chicken with rice and peas, cabbage, and plantains. The chicken was boneless, ive never had authentic curry chicken without bones, rice peas and cabbage were not seasoned well nor cooked well. The only thing i ate was the plantains, cant go wrong with them. It was just a mess at first bite. It is affordable and the owner was nice but no thank you. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is nice. Staff were friendly anfld greeted us as we entered. The prices are reasonable. The reason my rating is low is because of the taste of the dish. I ordered a curry chicken plate with rice peas and roti bread. It was the most flavor less island curry I ever tasted. Two other friends were with me and they agreed their food was just ok. I had been here before and I believe the wings were good however. It may just depend on what you order."}
{"text":"The food here was good. I got the 1/2 chicken and wings. The sauce on the chicken was pretty tasty. So if the food was decent, why the two stars?  I placed a pickup order through the yelp app and they charged me ~$3.50 more than the total on my online order confirmation. When I brought up the difference to the cashier, they just shrugged it off and said the app's prices were out of date. So.. be careful if you're ordering through yelp."}
{"text":"The outside and the inside is clean and looks like a Caribbean cafe but the food doesn't taste like it."}
{"text":"I'll give 4 stars because the staff is so nice and friendly! But the food is not for me. I ordered chicken breast with yam and greens and everything but the yam had this spicy vinegar sauce. Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but I just didn't like the seasoning. My friend loved!"}
{"text":"I visited Anntony's for the first time in ten years last night.  Don't read too much into that.  I never had a problem.  I just never found my way back.  Thanks to yet another heavily discounted gift certificate, I returned.  I am glad I did.  We both had the the Two Meats Combination for $13.95.  You can choose from white and dark meat rotisserie chicken, roast pork, ribs, etc. and add two side orders.  The roast pork was a hit.  The rice, black beans, yams, and greens were also well received.  The chicken (white and dark) was also tasty.  We finished with some freshly home-made banana pudding, and some freshly store-bought turtle cheese cake.  The banana pudding was actually pretty good.  Our waitress, April was keenly attentive and just plain fun.  See you there sometime soon!"}
{"text":"This evening was my 1st visit to Annthony's & I was pleasantly pleased. My friend & I had mild jerk wings, a side of Mac n cheese & chicken patties... all of  which were delicious. The mac n cheese was EXCEPTIONAL, the patties were great and the jerk wings were good too, but I like my wings fried a bit harder. Other than that, everything was great! I'd definitely go back again even if only for that Mac n cheese!"}
{"text":"I purchased a voucher randomly on groupon. My parents were in town for the weekend so we decided to try this place. I wasn't sure what to expect but it was a very small establishment, about 4 tables. The waiter was really nice (the larger set guy) however, I will not go back. My step dad ordered the curry chicken and he liked it but I think he was just really hungry and didn't want to complain. I order the ¼ white meat meal with bac mac and their rice with cabbage and carrots in it. One of our meals were sitting at the counter for a long time and right before brining it out it looked like they dipped more sauce over it (I think it was mine). My food was really cold, the sauce was not even room temp so I couldn't even tell if the chicken was warm initially or not. I didn't even attempt to really eat anything else. The corn bread was cold as well. My mom ordered the wings, which were hot so I am assuming the other food was sitting out waiting for her wings to get done. Overall, I didn't like anything. It all taste like too much vinegar. It was a little overbearing taste. The waiter apologized and removed my meal from our bill. Not a good first experience but hey, you won't like everything."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for lunch yesterday and were blown away! They have lunch specials for $5.50 and for that you can get a roasted leg and thigh (chicken with an AMAZING homemade Caribbean sauce) and two sides! I chose a mountainous heap of black beans and rice (it was incredible), and spicy cucumbers (raw cucs in some kind of spicy vinegar sauce, also delish). Our server was Rachel and she was amazing too. Extremely informative about the food and recipes, and also very kind. We were so impressed with our lunch we came back again today to see Rachel and I got the same exact lunch because it was so perfect! We wish there were more places like this around...unbeatable homemade food at a more than fair price. Wish I could give Anntony and Rachel six stars."}
{"text":"This place is really unique.  It has a cool island design to it, and flags from all the Caribbean countries hanging from the ceiling.  The paintings on the walls are very cute and creative as well.  The food is the real winner here though.  It's all very fresh and flavorful and had a little kick to it.  I don't like too much spice, but they got it just right.  My favorite part of the meal was the side dishes.  I highly recommend the black beans, they were great.  The service could have been a little better, but I've had worse."}
{"text":"Food was good as always. I had the jerk chicken and it was very juicy. The collard greens are prepared a bit different than what I'm traditionally used to. However the greens flavor was amazing."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place especially the island wings and the potato salad I have to order them each time I go here it's amazing and they sell their sauce in the grocery store which is another major plus"}
{"text":"Some of the locations have fallen off tremendously, but this location has seemingly stayed on point.  Reasonably priced whole chickens and other great options.  They have some meat pies, but other than that I wouldn't call this place traditional other than that.  Kind of Americanized.  Still great food though.  I havn't gotten anything besides a whole chicken in quite some time, because its just cheap, easy and feeds a lot of people.  Give them a shot, there aren't too many other decent options in the area."}
{"text":"Caribbean for Vegetarians!  Anntony's is one of my go-to lunch spots, even though the dining room is much smaller than it used to be. Service and food are always amazing, and the vegetable plate options are diverse enough to keep a vegetarian happy after multiple trips."}
{"text":"Totally not impressed. The food is not authentic Caribbean style food. It taste like someone tried their hand at a Caribbean recipe. I really don't know what all the fuss is about but clearly the people in Charlotte  have a small Caribbean  community  and haven't been exposed to really good Caribbean cooking."}
{"text":"Average at best, and overpriced. Several much better Caribbean restaurants in Charlotte, and less expensive. Seek those out instead."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent service, low prices. I could not ask for more from this restaurant. Our waitress asked if we had been there before and gave us a free sample of the wings. The fish tacos are out of this world, if you're in the area, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"My fiance and I first tried Antonny's last year and the food was delicious.  The second time we went, we had really poor service.  The waitress came to our table to take our drink order and literally didn't come back to refill our drinks or check on us to see if we needed anything.  We tried to give it another shot and ordered take-out instead, but when we ordered the takeout, we learned they were out of oxtail.   My fiance and I thought that maybe it was just an off-night so we gave it a few more tries, and for 3 consecutive visits, they claimed they were out of something we wanted, such as the oxtails, stewed chicken, curry chicken, or cabbage.... the list goes on.  It is disappointing because this has happened on more than one occasion, and we visited early enough in the day they they should not have been out already!   It became laughable as the last time we visited, we expected them to say they were out of something, and sure enough, they were out of curry chicken, so we walked out the door and never went back."}
{"text":"Service was very good, food was excellent and enjoyed my time there. Waitress brought out free samples since it was my first time at that restaurant. Will definition go back again."}
{"text":"Me and my husband was very disappointed with the food ,  and for the price of food very upset. I  will  never go back here sorry."}
{"text":"I had the ribs and the wings. The sauce was awesome, never tasted anything like it before. The food just woke my taste bud up, every bit was mouth waking experience. The food temperature was hot and not warm, awesome!!!!."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Succulent pork beyond tender. Oxtails on deck. They even have fresh patties; I mean what more do you need? Best okra in the city. Spicy cucumbers leave ya breathing fire. They even got Curry goat. Curry. Goat. If you don't know then you're not knowin man."}
{"text":"LOVE the chicken wings and the seasoned fries! The wings are rotisserie; it's not unheard of for them to run out. The seasoned oil they use on the almost shoestring fries is soooo tasty! They sell some sauces and such to enjoy their flavors at home, too!"}
{"text":"This place is a great alternative to all the chain restaurants in the area. I was recently in the area on a business trip and wanted something other than a grease spoon. This was just the place I was looking for and my lunch was tasty. I ordered the roast chicken with plantains which was priced well and worth it!"}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon recently and happened to be on the east side of town.So I decided to give it a try, mind you I've been to the Sugar Creek/WT Harris restaurant that shares the same name & the food at that one restaurant was delightful! What a disappointment! When I walked in the place it was deserted, no one in sight but the host who talked fast & loud(mind you my family is from the West Indies)  I looked at menu & saw no oxtail was on menu which is a main dish for carribean restaurants. Well since I was here & hungry I may as well order so I ordered ribs entree w/ Mac & cheese & calypso rice & Island so and wings wings with same sides to go. Food smelled good during the ride home. But when I took the first bite, food I had the rib entree it was \"Very Bland\" so I took a few more & same result, I didn't stop there I called out to my daughter to taste & her response was \" where did you get that? This tastes plain/no spices! I told her Annthonys & offered her the Island wings she refused and suggested i never go back! So with that being said, I will never eat here again! :("}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Anntony's but when I worked uptown, my coworkers and I would go pretty regularly for lunch.  I was a fan of their rotissarie chicken, black beans, and calypso rice. The service is generally bad, but we were willing to overlook that because the food was pretty tasty and affordable.  We never ate dessert here, but the owners apparantly have a catering business on the side and the sweet treats in the refrigerated cases on the way out look delish!"}
{"text":"Its a family casual restaurant, the best rotisserie chicken and of course the famous Anntony sauce which is delicious! Its sad to see that sometimes there isnt a lot of people in the restaurant. The staff is okay. If you go have some SWANK! :)"}
{"text":"Anntony's Carribean cuisine is very out-of-the-ordinary. Nestled nicely in a corner lot, beside the Food Lion off Sugar Creek Rd, it can be easy to miss. As you get in close proximity, and particularly inside the restaurant, you wonder how it ever went un-noticed due to the \"loudness\" of the environment, decor, and atmosphere.   The Carribean menu is also very uncommon to the area. The menu variety is such that may or may not have been compiled from homemade recipies and \"twists\" on real Carribean delicacies. I can assure you, they pull this off well. My usual here is grilled chicken w/ calypso rice and some kind of special Carribean lemonade. It is very good and the spices are right on the money!   I've been out to the restaurant about four times now, and everytime I am greeted and served extremely well. Service is very quick.  They never seem to have much of a crowd. I'm unaware of how long the business has been in operation, but I do hope they have enough of a following to stick around.  This business caters as well."}
{"text":"This is a small Caribbean restaurant tucked away in the Food Lion shopping center near intersection of Sugar Creek and WT Harris. Colorful decor with table and bar seating. Service was excellent and the food was delicious! I went with a small group and we are all very pleased with the curry chicken, meat patties, pork chops, and jerk chicken meals. Large servings that are sure to fill you up. If not sure what to get to drink...I recommend the \"Swank\". It's a fruity lemonade type drink that's really good. Some evenings you may get lucky and get to hear some live music. This place is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst carribean food I have ever tasted!!!! I mean seriously how is this even classified as carribean food????"}
{"text":"Food was awful...this is NOT an authentic Caribbean food restaurant....the food had no flavor..Rice and beans which is found in Jamaican restaurants was more like rice and some sort of peas which looks like black Eyed peas..The greens had a tangy taste..never had greens like that before, and the curry chicken was spicy with no real flavor.  Tried this restaurant almost 2 yrs ago, and decided to try again this week..Food was just as bad as the first time.. The staff, however, was very nice."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to take me to Anntony's because he had a good experience here a few months back, and I'm always up for trying new places!  The place was really festively decorated...flags hanging from the ceiling, art painted on the wall, plants and candles all around - a very unique inside design.  Our service was adequate is the way I'll put it - we had our orders taken and drinks served efficiently, but there was little personal touch to any of the waitresses.  The food however, was much more than just adequate - I had the crab cakes with mixed veggies and some Caribbean rice - all of which were great - they use some very unique spices that give the food some zest and a whole lot of flavor - I was shocked how much flavor some mixed peas, corn, and green beans could have!.  The prices were very reasonable - the two of us ate for around 25 bucks and each had dinner with several sides.  Overall, it was a great experience, easy to find and get to, and I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Easily the worst Jamacian Oxtails ever. The \"rice and peas\" was watery and the cabbage was bitter. I've been to multiple Jamacian restaurants from Atlanta to Ocho Rios, sorry but the flavors weren't there. Also tried the \"succulent\" ribs, different, and the beef patty which was ok. Sadly, the most enjoyable part of the meal was the plantains. They were excellent, nice and crispy."}
{"text":"Had a great seafood basket with fish, scallops, shrimp, & fabulous sauce.  Cute place, great atmosphere.  Takes you away to the beach!"}
{"text":"Very very good. Had the quarter chicken, calypso rice and collard greens. Everything was very good. The chicken was falling off the bone and very well seasoned. The beef patty was nice and spicy too. Can't wait to try some other things on my next visit."}
{"text":"I tried wings, brown Stew chicken, rice and peas, crab cakes, and plantains. It was mediocre at best. I liked the carribean lemonade a lot. The brown Stew chicken lacked flavor, the rice and peas had an overwhelming coconut flavor. The crab cake had nice chunks of crab and a nice tartar type sauce on top. I would come back for that lemonade!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: It's now Wednesday and we are still dealing with the GI upset from this meal. WARNING: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Love the food and service here. Make sure you get the special hot sauce if you can handle some heat. Best fish sandwich I've ever had, so that's my usual go to. Potato salad is excellent. If you like sweet, definitely try the lemonade. Great place and glad it's in my hood."}
{"text":"Grabbed the groupon and BOY the food was amazing! Will definitely be coming back again! Derrick suggested the wings and they were fabulous! Tried the Cajun Chicken as well, and I'll order that next time! Thanks Anntonys!!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Best potato salad I've EVER had!! The crab cakes were delish and the corn bread was a perfect accompaniment. I also enjoyed the brown rice as well as the pasta. Can't wait to get back here and try more stuff!!"}
{"text":"On this trip I tried the rotisserie chicken, cornbread & black eyes peas and rice.  The white meat chicken was cooked perfectly!  It was extremely tender and full of seasoned juices. The skin was soft and dripped of the tangy yet spicy sauce all throughout. Not too much; but enough to chase the meat with. The peas and rice had an incredible heat to them! Not in temperature; but in spice. They played well with the tangyness from the sauce. The cornbread was not a hit to me. I'm accustomed to sweet moist cornbread; and this was a little more stiff without the sweetness. Overall the meal was very satisfying!! My family enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Check out Anntony's if you are wanting to try new flavors. The quarter chicken white combo with greens and potato salad is a can't miss selection. The meat is juicy and flavored with the awesome sauce. The potato salad is both chunky and creamy with some spice added (warning: the heat builds up as you eat it). Several types of curries are offered (chicken, shrimp, ox tail, veggie) and the portions are plentiful. This is a unique restaurant with food you will not find elsewhere in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need to eat something that nurtures your soul without waiting 45minutes for it to be ready or worrying about it being fried...well, maybe that's just me. At any rate Anntony's on WT Harris is a solid place for some good Jamaican food.  I have been there several times ordering different things. My favorites are the baked island wings, beef patties, ox tail, curry goat and callaloo greens (the rice and peas are a given). The service is always friendly and the portions are good. You can also get delivery via UberEATS.   In all honesty, there have been days where the seasoning hasn't been quite right, usually just low on salt. Otherwise, always well cooked and tender. I have noticed these inconsistencies less and less though so maybe they have a new cook/chef. Nothing has every been to the point where I haven't wanted to return."}
{"text":"Horrible. This is no ways close to authentic. How can Carribean food be bland? Yes you heard me bland. Blander than the blandest American food. Was very disappointed. The only thing good was the shrimp other than that everything is a waste of taste buds. I actually felt like throwing up when eating the chicken roti. The collard greens looked like it was blended or out of the can. The goat roti was just nasty nasty nasty.... definitely a bad name for Carribean food. This was the consensus of the us all that had dinner there. Never again."}
{"text":"First time here..  Absolutely loved the chicken.  The decor was nice.  The staff is came over to assist my wife and I..  Definitely a place to revisit."}
{"text":"So good- we haven't found a lot of authentic Caribbean places in the south, and Anntony's is the real deal. We were in town for just a second and I'm so glad our hosts recommended this place. They had musicians playing outside on the sidewalk, and as out-of-place as it seemed in the strip mall, it added a great vibe to the whole experience. Although I could have lived without a TV in every direction...   Make sure to get the plantains and mango pie (if there's any left!).  We also really appreciated being able to have a glass of wine with dinner."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town, Norfolk Virginia to be exact. I went here craving some oxtails. These are the worst oxtails I have ever tasted. They taste like spice and white rice. They cooked them correctly but it was lacking taste! The Mac and Cheese is okay. Potato Salad is disgusting. Where I'm from we have a huge Caribbean population and although they have the Caribbean presentation, they don't have the Caribbean taste!! The girl with the curly hair did a great job with her service though. The food is nasty,honestly. Please do not waste your money like I did. They also have this policy posted by the register that they are not responsible for missing items so you should check your food. A little odd for a business to not hold their employees for mishaps but it more of the customers fault. Charlotte has no good oxtails, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Pleasant visit. The staff was friendly and courteous. The food is okay (4 out of 5).  But i do appreciate the need to make the food available to ever group rather than being exclusive with the pricing.  They give you a glass with your meal which is a nice takeaway."}
{"text":"I love trying new places and decided to go to Anntonys after I found a groupon. It's located in Elizabeth next to Bang Bang burgers. I came for dinner with my husband. They have a nice sized outdoor patio, but the inside is very tiny. There are only about 5 tables. However, we were greeted instantly as we walked in. I was a little skeptical at first because it wasn't the nicest restaurant from the initial looks of it, but the food made up for it.   I ordered the 1/4 chicken combo which came with two sides! I got a side of the rice (awesome) and the Mac n cheese (don't judge me for ordering two carbs). The chicken was so good! It was HUGE and it literally fell off the bone. The sauce was also really good. It was a cross between jerk and sweet. The server even told us a little secret on how they 'make' the sauce ;-)  I'm not kidding when I tell you my meal was huge and get this- it was only $8.95.   My husband got the two meat combo- 1/4 chicken and wings 5). I would recommend getting the curry chicken or Caribbean chicken next time as the regular chicken and wings came with the same sauce, but they were delicious.   I'm glad I tried Anntonys and I think I will be back in the summer for lunch! They had a jerk and Caribbean wrap that sounded bomb.   I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I eat here regularly. The Island Wings are great! You can easily taste the numerous ingredients on your initial bite. And before you know it, you will be craving those wings every time you are in the area."}
{"text":"This place must have a new owner. Everything tastes off. The favors were not there. The Island wings wasn't even grilled like they normally do. They deep fried them, then poured sauce on top. The calypso rice was bland. It doesn't taste like it normally would. The last 4 times I have been to Anntonys, I have been very disappointed. I'm almost certain they have to have new owners."}
{"text":"You will receive great customer service at Anthony's Caribbean Café. I placed an order via phone, as my parents were headed to the airport. My father insisted on having Caribbean food before leaving.The staff on the phone was friendly and advise for me to pick up my food in 15 minutes. When we arrived the restaurant was clean, and the staff greeted me with a smile. They were friendly and the food with hot. My dad really loves authentic Caribbean food, and when he cleaned his plate, I knew that the food met his expectations!!! He orders curry chicken, cabbage, peas and rice with plantains."}
{"text":"Food was fine. They were out of the items we truly wanted. We will try again earlier in the day and, hopefully, get to try the items we wanted (stewed chicken and goat)."}
{"text":"I wanted an authentic Caribbean meal for lunch.  The callaloo was not fresh and tasted like collards (I'm certain it actually was collard greens, not callaloo. There is a difference.) with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ flavoring.  The curry goat tasted watered down, like it was frozen and then reheated and during that process the water from the potatoes diluted the flavor of the dish.   The \"spice bread\" was undeniably boxed spice cake. I was thoroughly disappointed.  The only redemption was the price and the Ting (you can't go wrong with Ting).  Perhaps the other location has better preparation?"}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch and it was horrible. First thing it was dirty. Only 4 tables in what used to be one of the Best places to eat in the 90's. It used to be a nice size,but the Bang Bang Burger place took over the other half of the restaurant. We we're greeted by the Waitress/cook/cashier all in one that appeared to be Drunk. She looked as if she overslept and put on whatever she could find to go and open up the place. They only had 1 order of wings,but l was confused as it is on 12 o'clock and you just opened. The food was not fresh and she warmed it up in the microwave. There was another couple in there eating but they left as it seemed like they were upset as well. Once they left, no other customers came in there to eat. Everyone was parking and going to Bang Bang Burgers to eat. As they left,they were peeking in to Anntony's to see if they were still in business. It was a waste of time and money. I will not return to this location,but will try the W. Sugar Creek location to see if we can get the original Anntony's Food we got back in the day."}
{"text":"My #1 place to go for catering any event. Amazing food and the sauce is to die for!  This restaurants been open for over 25 years in Charlotte, kudos for longevity."}
{"text":"An old staple of mine when i lived in Charlotte.  Still excellent, although a little disorganized at lunch.  Order the quarter chicken with collard greens an rice.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Try the Caribbean Chicken with black beans & rice and sweet potato fries. Absolutely fantastic! Very craveable. The service tends to be slow at times, but the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area and had stopped on their patio next to Food Lion to listen to some nice Calypso music guitarist they have on the weekends. The lit tiki torches added to the mood. The food was delicious, crab cakes, Caribbean cooked veggies that were interesting and not too unusual. Service was fantastic. I wish more people knew of this jewel. A regular place for my neighbors and I can see why! Give it a try and you will not be disappointed. Full bar."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting here. Please please please check your food if you're doing take out. $15 for nothing. I've got more rice than anything. Greens were too sweet and the potato salad was dry. They gave me TWO oxtails. I was so angry."}
{"text":"Wonderful Awesome and professional!! The atmosphere and the food with great service. It was my first time and I will return. I went to the one on Sugar Creek and WT Harris."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the recommendation of a friend. It looked a bit pricy at first but it turned out they actually had an unadvertised lunch special (entree with two sides!) for under six dollars.  The staff was great/very attentive and I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the sides."}
{"text":"The food is very good here. It comes to the table quickly and hot. Family style service for multiple people is great. This restaurant has a child's menu offering. So if children are imprtant customers here, why on earth are there no baby changing tables in either bathroom? We dined there with my family this weekend, and sure enough my 1 year old grandson needed a diaper change. So in the middle of the meal, my daughter had to LEAVE THE RESTAURANT to go to the car in the cold rain to change his diaper! Not good. Grandma and I eat here, but now I might not be such an avid customer anymore. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE if you are a family friendly place."}
{"text":"I don't understand any of the negative reviews on here! Sure the dining area is small, but the food was FANTASTIC! Loved the sauce. My husband and I shared 4 sides and the coleslaw was my fav. Will definitely come back! I never knew a truly authentic Jamaican restaurant existed in charlotte until now."}
{"text":"Very good. I use the sauce at home on everything, from steaks, chicken and fish to pasta salad.   This is the first time I have has their food since I left Charlotte. I had a 4 count ribs and a half chicken- dark meat with greens and rasta pasta. Everything was excellent. In fact, I wish I got more ribs!"}
{"text":"We came here last night because I've heard really good things about their Caribbean food. When we arrived, we were seated immediately without any waiting. I wasn't expecting it but they had live music which was an added plus cause I love live music and the musician was singing some Bob Marley classics.  The wait staff wasn't horrible but I've had better.  The food was good. I had the ribs and now I see why they are called Succulent Ribs on the menu...because they were exactly that lol. The issue we had with the menu was that we couldn't order the oxtail or the stew chicken dinners because they didn't have any more. That sucked cause we really wanted the oxtail too. You would think they would be overly stocked with food on a Friday night but apparently not.  On another note, to the owner who has all of the flags from the Caribbean hanging from the ceiling, I politely ask that you please add the Haitian flag up as well. Since I'm Haitian, it was the first thing I looked for as we were being seated and was later told that they have it but it was not up. What's up with that?!"}
{"text":"This place has good potential. I enjoyed my experience. The menu is very simple and the staff was nice. I still don't understand why there were no plantains on the menu. I had the beef patties which were spicy, good favored, chicken wings: well cooked but still tender, 1/4 white chicken, mac & cheese, greens and corn bread. The chicken was tender with good flavor, mac & cheese wasn't cheesy and seem dried out with lack of seasoning, the greens were different...yet interesting because they were a bit sweet. The cornbread was bit size but didn't really have flavor. The smoothie I had wasn't made with fresh fruit so it was more like an icy with fruit mix."}
{"text":"Came upon the place from Groupon, giving it two stars only because my daughter liked her dish, which was curry chicken. The food wasn't terrible, it just was very bland. My husband and other daughter had the jerk wings and said they were ok. I had the veggie plate-rice and peas, collards, cabbage and rice and yams. No flavor or seasoning and it seemed like nothing was cooked fresh, just reheated. Wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"We ended up here on a Groupon.  Actually- I realized it was expiring the next day so my husband and I high tailed it over there on a Saturday afternoon to use it!  We got there at an off time, around 2:30pm.  We were the only ones in there besides a couple guys waiting for take out.  There's around 5 small tables inside and Ira definitely no frills.  There's a large drink cooler with beers and soft drinks if you are thirsty, and a small counter to order at.  Our server was very friendly to us, a younger girl with a spunky personality.  She was having a loud conversation with another employee that we probably shouldn't have heard, though.  The food was great!  Not sure why others complained about portion- I guess it depends what you get.  I had the caribbean chicken wrap with Mac and cheese.  The wrap was good, Mac and cheese wasn't my favorite.  My husband had jerk chicken, greens and rice.  He liked it and it filled him up, which is saying something.  Worth stopping in if you'd like something different!"}
{"text":"Always great food and at a great price! $6.95 got me 1/4 dark meat w mac and cheese, candied yams and a piece of cornbread!  Not a lot of room inside but there is outdoor seating and most seem to order takeout anyway.  Pro tip... they sell bottles of the amazing sauce that comes on the chicken!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, family & fun. We met Anntony himself.  He and the rest of the staff were instantly like family.  We felt at home & very well taken care of.  The food was great.  Again, like being at home with a Caribbean grandmother in the kitchen.  Live music out front during the warm months adds to the island feel."}
{"text":"Delicious! The chicken is very flavorful and moist and the cornbread was some of the best I've had. The greens were also seasoned perfectly and complimented the rest of the meal well. The service is also very nice and everyone was super friendly! My only complaint is that it was a little hot in the restaurant, though it is the middle of Summer."}
{"text":"Rarely have I been to a worse restaurant.  I got the chicken salad with sides and couldn't stomach any of it.  Maybe it was the fly stuck to the corn bread that came with the meal that turned me off.  My friend got the ribs and they were disgusting.  This place is horrible and overpriced and I thank god neither of us got food poisoning."}
{"text":"Their Cuban Roast Pork sandwich and Succulent Ribs (appetizer) could quite possibly my favorite meal in town!    I love hot sauce and spicy foods and I think Matouks (sp?) sauce they have could be the hottest thing I've ever eaten.   The staff had it's moments of up and down service the first few times I went. As they recognized me it has been much better and more fun to visit.   Great food and friendly staff makes this a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"Excellent place and it had not been my intention to come here, but the place I was headed was closed on Wednesdays. So, this is where I landed.   Because I checked in on YELP, I automatically got four small pieces of Caribbean chicken.  That enticed me to order their white chicken with mixed veggies and Mac and cheese.  It also came with corn bread.  Absolutely phenomenal!   This restaurant is close to where interstate 77 and Harris Blvd meet.  It is next to a Food Lion, in a very unpretentious location.  The minute you walk in, you feel a Caribbean vibe and also notice how clean it is.  We were lucky that Tony, the owner, came to our table and chatted with us for quite some time.  Who knew he is an Osteopathic Doctor?  He has a million philosophies on health and food and drink and all things spiritual.   If I was not into the food, I would come back to talk with Tony. But, as it is, I will be back for the food and the conversation.    It will be sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"I moved to Charlotte from Orlando and was DYING to find some Caribbean food and I must say this place let me down . My main issue with the food is the flavor. I would not call the seasons they use \"Caribbean\". I've grown up on Caribbean food and have never tasted anything that was seasoned like this. I ordered the curry goat and it had more of a middle eastern type of taste to it, not quite \"West Indian\" like Caribbean food should taste like. I haven't been back and honestly I don't plan on it."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the one and only waitress needs to be watched. I pulled my wallet out to pay for my meal and out came a $10 bill next to my wallet. The waitress swiftly pulled the 10 off of my table and walked away.  I had no intentions of giving her $10 for a $19 meal. My wallet was wide open, so it was obvious to me that I wasn't through with my transactions. I didn't say anything.... but this was definitely foul play. I usually tip a good 20%, but she knew what was happening. Never again."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I have been here 3-4 times for lunch and the service and food have been outstanding every time. Love the wings!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food ... fabulous!  I had ribs, greens, and cole slaw. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Mr Anntony makes all of his sauces. The roasted wings... Jesus.... They were great! I ordered the roasted wings & curry chicken. So, great that I didn't want to stop eating! Mr Anntony was miraculous! I never been to a restaurant and served by the owner. I really suggest a visit."}
{"text":"Was craving some beef patties so I stopped by antonnys since I was in the neighborhood. I was greeted by a pretty smile but that's kinda it.  I ordered 4 beef patties and was told \"We don't have 4\". So.... As we stared at each other, I thought \"that was on the rude side\". I actually had to ask how many they had. They had two left,  if you were curious. So I said I will take the two. She told another employee \"two beef patties\" halfheartedly and I thought, \"these people are bumming me out! I grabbed my bag and got out of there. I was not happy with the interaction at all.  The beef patties ended being good, but I don't Foresee going back any time soon."}
{"text":"The quality of the food here is garbage. I have eaten here for many years and stopped about 7 years ago. I ordered takeout and everything was disgusting even my dog would noy eat it. This is not authentic i dont know what to call this mess. Never ever again. Even if im starving i wont eat here. I irder 1/4 dark chicken with greens and cabbage with cornbread. WTF"}
{"text":"The only thing good was the customer service. They were out of almost everything. The foods flavor was very lack luster and I tasted nothing Caribbean about the food. And my stomach was in shambles shortly after eating here."}
{"text":"I love this place, everything I order is good including the oxtails and island wings. Just make sure you call ahead about the oxtails because they tend to run out. The prices are quite reasonable with an extensive menu to choose from. Everyone who works here is super nice and friendly. They see me often and always greet me warmly. I'm West Indian so while it's not 100% authentic to me, I can still appreciate the good food. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The grouper sandwich is really, really tasty!  The food was good and enjoyable, I'm very glad to have been able to experience the fun that is Anntony's."}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic food! We go frequently and are never disappointed. Everything is always hot and fresh; they give you quite a bit, we always have leftovers!  Sauces are to die for."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  I have never been disappointed with anything on their menu! True Caribbean food!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner and had the oxtail with white rice, plantains and cole slaw. Honestly, it wasn't the best I have had but it was very good. The place is really dark inside, almost no lighting, not a fan of that. But I did notice almost everyone was ordering take out, so eating in the dark is not that big of deal. Will probs order the same thing but for takeout."}
{"text":"The food is bad but the service is even worse. We've been before with Groupons and weren't ever super impressed but it's always been cheap and fast so we'd go back now and again. The place has hit rock bottom recently though. We went in for lunch at noon on a Saturday and found the restaurant completely empty. We decided to sit outside since the weather was so beautiful. The female employee that greeted us (she was outside playing on her phone and rushed inside behind us) told us to sit anywhere and she'd come take our order.   We took our menus and sat at the rickety picnic table on the patio. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. Eventually, Ted went inside to try to place our order. He found the waitress on her phone - she stopped talking long enough to tell him, \"Go back to your table. I'm a waitress. I'll come take your order.\" We should have just left then. Instead, we waited outside until she came out for our order. This was the point I noticed that she had a hole in the crotch of her yoga pants and no, she wasn't wearing any underwear. Again, why we didn't leave then is beyond me.   We ordered a rack of ribs, a whole chicken, and collard greens. (There were 4 of us, btw.) About 5-10 minutes after ordering, she came out to tell us that there was a half a rack of ribs available immediately. When we indicated that we'd wait for the full rack, she coped one of the worst attitudes I've ever experienced from a waiter or waitress and told us, \"Well, you'll be waiting over 3-hours then,\" and stormed inside. FINALLY having enough (3 strikes and you're out?), we got up and left. I'll never be back.   I only hope they go out of business sooner rather than later so a quality spot can move in to their prime real estate in Pecan Pointe!"}
{"text":"Today was my third time visiting this restaurant and was able to use a Groupon. Their food is consistently good and the chicken is always delicious. Today I had collard greens with tomatoes and onions as a side as well as the yams, which were both good.   The only negative feedback I have is that they downsized their dining area and it is very small inside. However, I have noticed during my visits that a lot of people get takeout from this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favs in town. Saturday afternoons there is live music! The crabcakes are great and the potatoe salad is amazing!!! The owner is absolutely wonderful, he is friendly and very caring!"}
{"text":"The food was terrible. There is no legitimate reason a restaurant in this location could be open for this long and serve food this bland and mushy. My fiancé and I had the jerk chicken wrap, black beans, 1/4 dark chicken, collards greens and calypso rice all had no flavor expect for the glop of over peppered sweat and sour sauce they called their signature sauce. I wouldn't eat there again even if it was free."}
{"text":"I headed here for lunch with my boss & some coworkers & was impressed with their food. While it wasn't out of this world, it was better than I was expecting. But I just learned that it's a franchise restaurant, albeit a local franchise, but this kind of knocked it down a notch for me.  I had the wings & the sauce they give you is awesome. I think they actually sell it by the jar too & I can see why. It was a Caribbean flavored sauce, obviously, & they coat it on the wings. While the wings may not have been the best I've ever had, the sauce definitely made up for it. They also had some odd side items that I wasn't exactly thrilled about. I actually had quite a problem figuring out which side to order.  Anntony's doesn't give off the franchise vibe, but once i found out it kind of irks me. They have a great Caribbean flavor that is quite different then other places in Charlotte. If you're looking to switch it up for lunch then head here, as you'll find a whole new taste then the normal lunch fare."}
{"text":"Don't know you need it in your life until you try it. :) Delicious spicy (or not) sauces, ladled over tender fall off the bone slow cooked meat. I'm partial to the 1/4 chicken white with spicy jerk, but the mild island sauce is delicious too. Good portions and a variety of sides like rice, seasoned fries, plantains, and collard greens. Laid back vibe in an open and airy dining area. Prices are average to the area. A great alternative to all the chain restaurants...yummy comfort food. Will update with pictures next time!"}
{"text":"I was not so happy with the food but the customer service was the worst! My potato salad and mac had spicy vinegar sauce all in it. I had the wings which were dry. I called back it was so bad. The staff said the manager would have to call me. After a few hours passed. His resolution was not to replace the meal but to come back and purchase something else for 50% off.  I told him I would not spend one more dime there and the food there I had was nasty.  His attitude did not reflect a business owner who was about customer resolve.  He prided in saying he has been in business for 20years.  Does he really think that makes his brand Great!  I don't and would never spend money in this establishment ever again."}
{"text":"This place has changed ownership from my early days in Charlotte and they have reduced the size of the restaurant by 80%. Only 4 tables available for seating now. Bang Bang Burgers now occupy the old section.   The waitress/cashier greeted us immediately upon entry and was friendly throughout dinner. However, while putting in an order for appetizers and drinks, they were out of beef patties and the island swank tea which is a bummer. Ok well let's order our entree. After placing our orders, we find out 5 minutes later that they don't have enough chicken wings. Wow, best to just tell me from the start what you don't have! Seems like everything we ask for, they are out if.  The chicken and ribs were pretty good with the special Antonnys sauce. Calypso rice, rasta pasta and greens weren't seasoned enough, but mixing in the sauce gave it much flavor. Overall the food was tasty. To stay in business,  Antonnys must ensure that menu items are on stock each and every day."}
{"text":"Anntony's Caribbean Cafe on 7th St. was a favorite of my youth. Back then the dining room was much larger but now the restaurant focuses on catering and take-out with a few tables indoors and on the patio. The tangy sauce here is SO GOOD. The waitress told me they had to take the bottles of sauce off the table because people were taking the whole bottle! I love the combination of rice, slaw, sauce and chicken here. So good. Calvin enjoyed his curry chicken as well although the corn bread was a little dry. Try the swank - a tasty nonalcoholic drink that tastes like a combination of lemonade and iced tea. Wing platters, pork chops, pork ribs, collards, and mac & cheese (Monday only) are also offered. Glad to be back in town so I can come back to Anntony's often!"}
{"text":"Food was average not flavored as strong as I am accustomed too. Customer service could be better, the young lady at the counter was rather rude and snotty."}
{"text":"I'm sad to post this bc this place use to have AWESOME food, but after this last visit, I'll never go again. (I wouldn't have given any stars, but Yelp won't let you do that.)  There was a fish smell to my mom's & my chicken, so we didn't eat it for fear of food poisoning. My daughter said her's tasted odd. The greens had the smell of cafeteria greens & certainly didn't taste the way they used to. Also, the rice was bland & dry this time. The cornbread was soggy & mealy.  We'd called ahead to pick up our order for about 20 minutes out, but we still had to wait 10-15 minutes for everything. One of the 2 guys working there parked his car in the closest spot to the door of the restaurant (my mom picked up on this as she saw him get something from his car while we were waiting for our order). And they say bathrooms tell a lot about a place...it certainly did in this instance."}
{"text":"I love this place and their food is great! However, they are always out of my favorite stuff by the end of the night. I love the plantains and 1/2 chicken with calypso rice and greens. The Groupon is not used at this location and is used at the other which is owned by different people. The food is good but when you're out of something I think offering extras would be nice due to the inconvenience. I'll be back but not soon."}
{"text":"I asked them if they made buss up shot and he told me yes. Unfortunately I didn't check my food before I got it home. When I got it home there was NO buss up, just a hard dry roti skin!!! So disappointing. The food is just blah. Nothing special at all. I've been 3 times just bc I like to give everyone more than 1 chance. Everyone has an off day. This place just always seems to be off as far as km concerned. Try caribbean hut instead!"}
{"text":"Me and wifey ate lunch here today. It's always good to see Dr. Martin (owner), he makes you feel at home. I ordered my usual 12 island wings, fries and swank. Wife had fish sandwich with greens, plantains and cabbage. The food IMO is always good and pretty consistent. The waitress we had I think was new, I could be wrong but I think she was. She was OK but made some rookie waitress mistakes I.E., grabbing a plate with food on it and as she was picking it up she asked \"your done with this right?\"  I was not done but this may be a big deal with some customers.  Food is good!! :-)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to check out in Charlotte. The Island sauce on any of the meats is delectable. Try the chicken or goat curry as well. The flavors will bring you back to the Carribean. The jerk wings are amazing and a must try. Check out this place, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the corner of a strip mall, this restaurant is easy to miss. But you can tell that it has a loyal customer base. Folks know each other.  I came here with several colleagues and had a quick lunch. Folks are really nice here. The owner came by and offered us a small plate of chicken wings and it was yummmmmmmy. Not only that, they came by with a small batch of curry for us to sample as well.  I went with ox tail in brown sauce and it was fantastic. Loved it. This is the real deal. I don;t always go to a carribean cafe, cos most don;t do the food any justice. But this place does it right.  Its kinda hard to find, but i think its worth the trip."}
{"text":"I love this place! I recently moved back to Charlotte and was looking for a good Caribbean food restaurant and I stumbled upon this one. They are very accommodating of all requests. I loveeeee the jerk sauce they use on the wings and the plantains are amazing. My only complaint is about the cornbread. It's very dry. But other than that, I definitely recommend this place! And the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"The food was excellent!  We had the ribs, wings & half chicken in jerk & house sauce.  The portions were large enough to have lunch the next day.  The service started out great but ended slow.  I would highly recommend Anntony's."}
{"text":"I've been here on multiple occasions and each time I have tried something different and each time I have enjoyed what I have gotten. The meat all seems to be marinated in the same tangy sweet marinade so there really aren't too many surprises no matter what you get. I feel like if you like one thing, then you will basically like everything. One thing to note is that you should definitely take the time to get to know the staff and the regulars because not everything that they offer is listed on their menu. Hint Hint Wink Wink."}
{"text":"I got the lunch special with 1/4 chicken and the jerk sauce it was not the best it was dry as well as the cornbread. I wouldn't return again."}
{"text":"Vinegar, vinegar and more vinegar is what you will taste in their chicken wings. They claim it's rotisserie style but why do they deep fry the wings (not sure what kind of grease...but it's definitely fried wings). There are much better Caribbean resturants in Charlotte. This establishment lacks authenticity.   It appears the owner definitely understands some marketing (or at least his local \"demographics\"). This establishment has decent ambience...Carribean flags (minus Haiti - interesting?) hanging, popular reggae songs playing in the background and the usual borderline pastel colored painted walls. Oh, let's not forget the owner shameless \"hot sauce\" plug. At least they serve good ol' redstripe."}
{"text":"I tried it for the first time last night, I love the island wings with the island sauce. The calypso rice and plantains are amazing as well. I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu. The waitress could tell that I was a first time visitor and she let me have a wing sample before i actually placed my order....customer service is a huge deal to me and she was very nice. Wings are a good size too."}
{"text":"Food was very good. My favorite was the calypso rice. It was very tasty. I was confused when I ordered a side of sauce and received a chicken wing with the sauce already on it.  Service was okay. My sisters order was wrong but we didn't bother to complain.  I tried to order take out today and no one picked up the phone. I called 10 times and no answer at the 11th try the line was occupied. It was frustrating because I really wanted some of their food.  Overall I would come back for the food but they need better service."}
{"text":"A fantastic meal from another culture. Has made the Best of the Best in Charlotte for a reason. Great service, ambiance and even better food."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here.  I was very excited to try the food, which didn't disappoint me.  However, the service was not good.  We came at lunch time and it wasn't too busy at all.  We got a table right away and ordered.  The waitress never came back once to refill our drinks. She never checked on our food to see if it came out ok. AND she failed to give us cornbread that is supposed to come out with each meal.  We had to ask the manager, who brought it after we were finished eating.  I had the pork chop and it was tasty. For my side, I had the rasta pasta-good! The service was very depressing."}
{"text":"Definitely will be regulars. Food is tasty and plentiful. I had the seafood with rice and beans,cabbage and cornbread. Hubby had the chops which were so tender and juicy."}
{"text":"Great food! Jerk chicken is pretty good! They actually make their own jerk sauce too. Coco bread and beef patty is on point. Rice and peas is great too! Will definitely be back!  Day 2: I made good on my promise, it was soo damn good!! This place is a gem  y'all definitely missing out!"}
{"text":"First off, let me say this: their cornbread is on another level of life...    Okay, so I went to Anntony's last night for a birthday dinner... This is another one of those places I've heard about a million times, but never visited... It's in a strip mall kind of thing, so if you don't know it's there, I guess you wouldn't really know it was there... It's a small, intimate place with friendly staff and televisions that you can see from pretty much any seat in the house...   The cornbread they bring out for you before your meal could have been my whole meal... It was sweet and crumbly in all the right ways... Awesome... I decided on the crab cake sandwich with rasta pasta and the callalou greens... The rasta pasta was a little lukewarm, but still delicious... The greens had a really interesting sweet-spicy-peppery-vinegary thing going on and I was a fan... The crab cake itself was fantastic... It was crunchy, held together well and was appropriately seasoned... The remoulade was good, too, but there was so much on my sandwich bread that it made the bread a little soggy... I just can't do soggy bread (it's one of my things... lol), so I just took the crab cake off and demolished it alone...   I actually met the owner... Turns out he was one of the guys serving us which I thought was really nice... He was really sweet and told me he was glad I was pleased with my meal and to come back soon... Definitely sounds like a plan to me..."}
{"text":"The curry chicken wrap was good, and the pork sandwich and wings were excellent!   The staff was friendly and the prices were fair."}
{"text":"I will agree with some of the reviewers that you can come and everything is delicious then come again and nothing tastes the same.  I've found that it depends on who is cooking that day.  Now I tend to look in the kitchen to see who's there and that determines if I'm ordering or not.  Always,  always get a Swank to go no matter whether or not I'm eating."}
{"text":"A friend of mine brought me here when I was visiting Charlotte last week. I like the physical appearance of the place. It's very big and colorful with various flags from other places hanging from the ceiling which definitely put me in the mind frame of the islands. I had the curry chicken, black beans, calypso rice, and plantains. I had my heart set on ox tails but they were out. Everything was good but not spectacular to me. My friend had the cuban sandwich with coleslaw and raved about it. She also had the coconut cake which she raved about also. They also had someone playing live music right outside the restaurant which I thought was pretty neat (and talented since he was a one man band lol). Even though I wasn't overly excited about my meal, the portions were plentiful and the service was excellent. I would come back and sample some of the many other options they had on the menu."}
{"text":"Good food and value.  I had the curry chicken with greens and rice.  Nice flavors, and good portion.  You don't leave hungry.  My friend had the Jerk Chicken, and another good choice.  Perfect food on a cold day!  You definitely need to check this place out.  I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food! I got the curried goat with a roti on the side and it was delicious! My only gripe was that the service was a little slow, but the food was amazing and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I'm extremely simple, I love veggies patties - period. It doesn't have all the veggies a traditional authentic Jamaican/Caribbean would, but it'll do.  I have tried their jerk wings and enjoyed them. Peeps rave about their special sauce and while I liked the sauce, I wasn't crazy about it.   Overall, the food is pretty good, and the facility is clean with vibrant colors."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!  I've been on multiple occasions and tried different items from their menu and all of them have been great!  The decor is a Caribbean Theme with a hand painted mural on the wall (see one of the attached pictures).  You come in and seat yourself and a moment or two someone brings you a menu (I've never had to wait extra long for service...even when it's packed).  The place is casual and they play Caribbean music sometimes but I have yet to hear anyone who actually works there or cooks the food have a Caribbean accent....who cares the food is excellent.  My favorites are their crab cakes.  You can get these as an appetizer and they come out over Red Leaf Lettuce with a vinegar sauce sprinkled on top.  Succulent, fresh, full of flavor and the Caribbean tarter sauce that accompanies them parallel to the flavor.  You can buy this sauce to take home also...I bought some to serve with some crabs cakes I was making for our seafood Christmas.  The last time I choose to order the Crab Cake Sandwich, with Calypso Collard Greens, and Rasta Pasta.  The Calypso Greens have sauteed garlic and onions mixed in with a mild spicy vinegar taste added.  The Rasta Pasta is noodles with cabbage and carrots added.  Everything was good (see the attached picture) and I ate everything!  They also have great Beef Patties, Wings, and Rotisserie Chicken.  You can find a coupon for them in the yearly coupon book letting you get a meal free when you purchase one.  So if you want to try them out and not fork over a lot of cash then use this coupon but I'm telling you that you will not be disappointed.  One of the best Caribbean cafes here in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Had an opportunity to stop in to try Antony's.  It had been many years since I visited any location.  Service was quick as there was only one customer in the restaurant.  I was disappointed, however, that the menu item I decided on prior to arrival (Roti Wrap) was not available in the restaurant.  I decided to order the chicken breast/thigh combination with sweet potatoes and black beans.  The chicken was prepared well and the Caribbean sauce was delicious.  While the sweet potatoes may have been prepared Caribbean style, I didn't care for them.  The black beans where simply edible.  That said, I am giving Anthony's 2.5 stars rounded up."}
{"text":"Let's just start with the customer service, it was the best service I've ever had and this was my first time visiting the establishment. The food is a whole 'nother story, it was ahmazing! I highly recommend Anntony's to anyone looking for some really good Caribbean food with his own delicious house sauces, hmm hmm good! To top it off as we walked outside we were greeted by Anntony himself and he asked about our time and I couldn't help but express gratitude for the excellent service and food. He has a great staff and I wish the best for him and his business! Thank you thank you to our waitress Dani (spell check), the staff, and Mr. Anntony himself, definitely coming back next time I visit Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here and Anthony, the owner, always personally greets us when we come in. He's a very giving and friendly person. The service is amazing. This one is MUCH better than the one downtown. Especially the food."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to post this because Anntony's was an excellent place to eat years ago, when Tony of Ann\"TONY\"s used to run it, but it has gone way, way down hill these days.  They are always out of food when they shouldn't be, very hit and miss on flavor and they used to roast their chicken fresh each day and I know the very tough chicken I just bought there was at least a day if not two days past it's prime.  The two that run the place obviously just don't care and their customer service is horrendous (or just plane absent) most the time.  I believe the place has been sold a few times and their just isn't any love or professional pride left. Good past memories though!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and the food, atmosphere, and service has always been excellent.  Have also gotten platters to go that everyone loved.  My favoriate would be the crab cakes and sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Tried this place today for the first time and loved it.  Goat curry (my first time eating goat) greens, cornbread and that wonderful grapefruit soda. Everything was great and portions were large. Service was really great also.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars for Anntony's!  I must admit I had not expected to eat here the day I tried this place out, but I was pleasantly surprised.  We were even calling the place \"Anthony's\" before we got there... man it's always nice and humbling to look up and read what you had been calling the place for the last 30minutes was really incorrect.  My stupidity aside, we walked in and the place really is decorated to the nines with the \"Caribbean theme\" and I really liked the used of the tall ceilings to display the nation's flags.  Very casual and laid back... the servers were very friendly... I think my co-workers said we had to beat the lunch crowd, so I bet this place can get pretty packed.  I chose to go with the pork sandwich with mixed vegetables and plantains.   Had to wait the longest compared to my buddies, but it was worth the wait...  The waiter even came by with a piece of cornbread for me to much on.  My plate was cleaned and I was super glad I had saved my plantains for last... :)  I definitely have plans to come back and try the chicken!"}
{"text":"This place is NOT authentic! Period. Discussion over. Not an opinion. Just facts!   I am from NYC and have many friends and family from all parts of the Caribbean. While the place looked nice and island like, well..... That was about it. The curry goat was watery and when the nice lady told us we had to pay a dollar more for another type of rice I knew this place wasn't gonna be good. Sweet plantain was good and that because how can you mess that up.   Back to the good. The oxtails were chewy and lacked proper consistency. The greens weren't great and the cabbage tasted more southern than Jamaican. Overall I was very mislead by the 4 star reviews and sad I took my friend there. She's never had Jamaican food and I'm not sure she'd want to try it again."}
{"text":"The Curry Chicken is my go to when I can't make up my mind. The plate comes with two sides and trust me, it's enough for two.... on for lunch and dinner if you're not in the sharing mood."}
{"text":"Not sure what the deal is in Charlotte, but the Caribbean food options are...(trying to be nice)...lacking (how was that?) I'm not just unimpressed by the quality of the food but I'm also taken aback by their boldness in claiming to be \"authentic\". I'm not by any means a picky eater, nor am I a bougie foodie. I am a True West Indian, born and raised, so can say I know a few things about true Caribbean food...and THIS AINT IT. The flavours we're not even the slightest bit Caribbean-esque. I mean the cook don't even look like she's from the islands. I give them 2 stars because the bartender was friendly and attentive.   I won't go into details about the dishes because at this point it's just not needed. If you're still feeling adventurous and you want to see for yourself, be my guest, however me and my yelp review will be here to say \"I told you so\"."}
