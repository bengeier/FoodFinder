{"text":"Ordered from the catering menu online. Took 3 phone calls for someone to take my order. When it was delivered,  was missing a tray of rigatoni. Had to wait 25 minutes for them to bring it. Meanwhile, the meeting had already started without people getting the pasta. The chicken was very overdone and heavily breaded. The salad was very good, the pasta (when we finally got it) was very good,  the sausage & peppers were very good. The sheet pizza was quite small. Will be hesistant to use them for future luncheons."}
{"text":"Still eating my vegan Mexican pizza and just had to write a review, given I've eaten this exact pizza 4 or so times. It's so loaded with veggies that I can't even feel guilty eating half a pizza. I've had their Ohio City vegan pizza as well. The Mexican is definitely amazing; the Ohio City is great if you want to experiment with nondairy options. Vegan options are extremely sparse in Cleveland and I'm so happy that Primoz has vegan pizza that's even better than what I've had at strictly vegan LA pizzerias.  Customer service has always been fine. Not sure why people are complaining. I order over the phone and get my food within 60 minutes."}
{"text":"I get the wings a lot they're small but super good. Red Dragon is the sheez. The pizza is really good too! Specialty pizzas are top notch and in my opinion rival Angelo's which is infamous in Lakewood. Tasty food. Kudos Primos."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try their pizza  for a while now. Today was perfect since my vegan teen needed a pick me up to let her know she is special and cared for. We headed out, not knowing if we could eat there or if we'd be taking it to go. We ordered a large Lakewood Vegan and sweet and sour \"wings.\" The wings were good and the pizza BLEW US AWAY!  We took it to the nearby park to enjoy since there are no tables at their location. It was delicious  and would be   had it been baked a little longer. (Although, we have leftovers, so that will happen soon enough.) Het yourself here!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I ordered from Primoz. The first time was on Super Bowl Sunday, so expected a wait. The order went just fine. I ordered two pizzas on Saturday through the website and after not getting a phone call after the 75 minute wait time, I called. My pizzas were not made yet as I guess there is some confusion with the online orders or the order wasn't noticed. I expressed my disappointment and they provide me with 50% off which was very nice. So, I said thank you and waited....and waited. After waiting another hour I called back and apparently they were just about to leave...not almost at my house but about to leave. I really enjoy the pizza and have suggested Primoz to a lot of people who are vegan and vegetarian, but I am now regretting it because no one should ever have to wait 2.5 hours for pizza. How can you plan an evening around that? The pizza is a little expensive so at that point, the discount was not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Saucy Vegan\" & it's probably the best pizza I've ever had! Even before I went vegan I haven't had pizza this good. Love!"}
{"text":"I ordered pizza and jalapeño poppers from here last night, first of all lemme say this I order a small pizza for $8.79  any additional toppings was $1.79 after which i wasn't aware of til i seen the receipt! Okay whatever, what made the matters worse was the jalapeño poppers tasted freezer burnt! So that pissed me off even more. But the overall icing on the cake I wasted almost 27 dollars on something that wasn't even good. It's still sitting in my refrigerator as i type this! First and last time trying this! I pretty much just donated my money!"}
{"text":"Never heard of this place until I received their flyer in the mail. It says that they deliver until 1 am on Saturdays. The menu looked delicious, and I was so excited to try the Westside Market pizza. I called at 12am to place an order, a lady answered the phone \"Hi we're closed\" and then hung up on me! Not sure if the place is new and the lady never worked customer service before, but it would have been better to have just not answered the phone. Awful, terrible first impression. Ended up ordering pizza from a reliable chain pizzeria, and probably won't bother to attempt to try this place again."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, but what impresses me most are the vegan and vegetarian options. I got the Saucy Vegan. I never knew pizza could be so good without cheese! As I said, the regular old cheese pizza was good, too, since I had to try that as well. Nice big crust on the cheese pizza, and both crusts had a slight sweetness to them. I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Received a promotion via the mail. I was hesitant to try but I wasn't disappointed. We had a large sausage pizza and cheese sticks. Everything was delicious and the prices were good. I am making them my go to pizza place!"}
{"text":"They honestly use fresh and real ingredients. The breaded chicken on a pizza is literally the best thing ever."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, a hidden pizza gem.  I must admit for a pizza place (which by the way has great pizza) they have better wings as well as better sauces than Buffalo Wild Wings. We are hooked the Fuego Ranchero wings.  I highly recommend this to the wing lovers.  We have tried the Seafood Pizza ( I know what your thinking and we took a chance) and it was awesome.  I also recommend the Beef sausage and Halal pepperoni pizza. A must try if you have not already."}
{"text":"We called at around 11pm on a Saturday and the kid who answered the phone took my order and then told me they were closed right after. Obviously this fledgling business won't last, but in the meantime, look anywhere else, including any Speedway gas station where they sell Digornios."}
{"text":"Primoz Pizza is hands down the best pizza in Cleveland. Highly recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"One star, because I could not choose zero stars. I don't know what happened, this place used to have great customer service.  I ordered online, at 6:00PM on a Saturday night for one pizza for pick-up. I received an e-mail with my order details, the order total, and an order confirmation number. The website and confirmation e-mail said that they would call me for my payment information, which was normal for this place. By 6:25PM, no phone call so I called the restaurant. I told them I had an online order for pickup and wanted to check the status. They put me on hold for a couple minutes, then picked up and asked if it was for delivery on hilliard in Lakewood. I said no, it was for pickup. On hold again. They came back on and said that they were looking for the order and would call me back when they found it. Fifty-One minutes later, I called back. They immediately said that they had no online order and asked if it would be pick up or delivery. Seriously?!?! No call back for an hour and then they ask if I want pick up or delivery? I told them I wanted to speak to a manager. I was placed on hold, and then hung up on. I called back, was placed on hold and was hung up on again. I called again and told them I would not hold, and wanted to speak to the manager. They put the phone down and I heard them talking to the manager, I think Jessica. The person said No, he won't hold but I could not hear anything else. The person came back and placed me on hold. I hung up.  Unbelievable! I am so happy they cannot credit card orders online. If I would have paid for this pizza I would have been livid.  Last time I try ordering from here. Sad too, the pizza used to be pretty good."}
{"text":"Waited too long for my pizza to arrive and manager was no help, only to offer 25% off in the future. If you want to wait 2.5 hours for your order after being told it would only take an hour, then this is your place."}
{"text":"Pizza is very good.  Had it delivered. On time.  A little expensive but just the way I like it.  Not too saucy! Stuffed crust is awesome flakey and delicious."}
{"text":"A friend brought me back lunch, which was a Stromboli. I had asked for a calzone, but he said that Stromboli is a better. I was floored by the size and the amazing taste. It was huge! I couldn't finish it all. I highly recommend this restaurant, & I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Decided to try this pizza on a whim after getting their flyer in the mail. It had a scratch off for a BOGO pizza. We got one XL pepperoni and one XL crumbled meatball.       Taste: I thought the pizza was pretty tasty. You can't really go wrong with pepperoni. I was surprised at how much I liked the crumbled meatball. The meatballs were delicious and I found myself picking them off and eating them by themselves cause they were so good. I thought there was a good amount of sauce, not too much or too little it tastes very good with a hint of sweetness. I saw while in their store that they won best sauce at the Pizza fest this year, which I think is well deserved. The only thing I would improve is the crust. It's not bad by any means, but it is very dry and could use some butter or seasoning.       Price: This place is pricey! I would compare the price to Angelo's (for my fellow fans) which is pretty expensive, without the amazing Angelo's taste. With our BOGO coupon, I think it was reasonable to pay $17 and some change for two XL pizzas. Each pizza had 12 slices, but they were on the smaller side. It was more than enough to feed my boyfriend and me for 3+ meals each.       Location: This place was a little more out of the way than we would normally go for pizza as we live in Lakewood. The area seems a little on the shady side and just about everything inside the place had me cracking up as we waited for our pizza. From the \"keep door closed\" sign on an open door that was propped open with a huge can of black beans to the Tropicana orange juice jug they were using as a vase for some pretty dead flowers, the place could use a little sprucing up. However, it did not seem overly dirty or anything like that.       Customer service: the people we dealt with were friendly, but they were just as friendly as they needed to be and nothing more. This didn't bother me, though. They did their job and that was that. We were quoted a half hour wait for our pizza. They seemed pretty busy and we ended up waiting about 45 minutes. They messed up the order of another woman who was waiting and they gave her a free 2 liter of their own accord for her troubles.       Would I go back? Depends on if I had a good coupon!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I'm picky about pizza but I thought the bbq pizza here was really delicious. The loaded fries... meh. I would skip them next time, as they're definitely not worth 8 bucks. delivery took less than an hour, so that was a plus. I would order again but they are VERY expensive for Cleveland pizza. So it won't be for a while."}
{"text":"Date: 7/11/17 Time: 4pm-8pm (two visits)  Ok, how's the pizza? Well I ordered a build your own with pepperoni, spinach, mushrooms and pineapple. Yes, I'm one of those people. My son had the Hawaiian. He said his pizza was great, noting that the addition of green peppers made all the difference, where most times you don't find that on a Hawaiian pizza. Mine, well meh, I could have had just as good if not better from Marco's or Guy's downtown. You should know that their red sauce is sweet, so if that's not your preference you may want to opt for something else.   The prices are high here. We had a BOGO coupon or otherwise, both pizzas would have been over $50. Yes, fifty bucks for 2 pizzas. For the price, even with BOGO, I would have liked an OMG WORTH IT reaction to the pizza flavor, and I definitely didn't have that experience.   Now we come to the good and bad of customer service here on my visit as a first time customer. We ordered around 4 pm and drove about 8 miles to pick up our order. I did examine the pizzas and they appeared to be accurate - but it was a quick glance. We bring them home and we're going to wait for the All-Star Game to eat them. Turns out, the Hawaiian pizza was fine, but mine had green peppers on it. Initially I thought they were jalapenos which for me is not just a pick-them-off option. I didn't even take a bite of the pizza. Call the store and a very young cashier says well, she can remake the pizza, as she should. I ask hey well do you think since I have to come all the way back, I could get a free two liter for the inconvenience. No, she can't do that and no there's no manager there, and no she can't call the manager.   Evidently she could and did. I was just about back to the location when the manager calls me. I restated the issue, and did tell her that I'd checked and thought the pizzas were fine. She says they can remake the pizza,but because it's been 4 hours and because I said that I had checked them and didn't say anything, she couldn't give me anything for free.   Let me stop here. It's NOT about a stupid two liter. I can get a cheaper two liter anywhere. It's about the impression on a first time customer, gaining return business, and looking like you want those two things to begin with. I didn't go in there demanding two free pizzas, coupons, and the soda.   I get to the location, the young girl looks at the pizza, informs me those are green peppers. Still not what I ordered. She gets the phone and calls the same manager in front of me while looking at the pizza, and explains it's got green peppers.    Wow, way to belittle your new customer. Yeah, I might have been lying you know so sure, call her immediately to let her know I was telling the truth about the mistake. Don't you think it could have been done after I left or at least not right in front of me?   Now here's where things went right. A young man working there, Jeremy, listened to my story and not only offered to give me the 2 liter of soda, but we had a very positive discussion on the long term value of customer satisfaction. He invited me to call the owner and give him my feedback, and of course I will follow up. Jeremy was kind, well spoken, calm and in no way condescending. Seems to me he needs a promotion. He spoke of a customer service ethic that I try to carry with me in my face-to-face customer service role every day. With social media, excessive competition and good old fashioned word of mouth, it's more important than ever to really ask the customer what you CAN do to make a situation right instead of telling them what you can't do. If you can't or won't do it, your competitor can and will. A 2 liter of soda that likely cost them .43 could have wound up costing them a heck of a lot more."}
