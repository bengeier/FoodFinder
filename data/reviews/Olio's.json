{"text":"Worst dinning experience I've had in years!  Poor service, poor organization,  1 1/2 hrs wait for a 6:00 reservation, ran out of food---they knew we were coming-- but  the most shocking was the attitude of the waitress and manager (John McCall).  To each of our queries,  they responded rudely, \"we're doing the best we can do\" in a rude, unapologetic manner.  I suppose John was too busy posting warnings about the long wait times(see his post Sat 12/9 2:23) to schedule enough wait staff or to order enough food!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this restaurant which is near our home in Gastonia. Very nice to have a place like this to go so close to where we live. Both my wife and I had the pork tenderloin dinner. The bread served before dinner was fresh and reflected the fact it was baked on premises. Pork was marinated, tender, plentiful, and cooked to perfection. Vegetables and rice were perfectly presented. Didn't have desert but am sure that is baked there and wonderful. Can't wait to return and sit on the outdoor patio which looked secluded and inviting. Great service also."}
{"text":"The menu here is very similar to the old Rodi that closed, I was really expecting some new dishes but it's the same old thing.  There is a reason that Rodi closed and the food was definitely one of those reasons.  I had a salad here, which oddly enough came on the same serving plate as the side salad.  So while the salad was fine, I felt like I could have saved some money and just ordered a side salad.    When great restaurants in Charlotte are a short 20 minute drive away, it's hard to recommend not making the drive rather than stopping here."}
{"text":"Where's the 6 star option? We took our two kids and pup here, and had an absolutely great experience. The kids meals were huge, chicken tenders were fresh and tasty, not frozen garbage. The baked crab Mac n cheese was out of this world. The pup enjoyed the porch and her personal water bowl. The fresh baked desserts were also great."}
{"text":"The restaurant was overbooked. Server was unprofessional. What food we did receive was cold and under seasoned. Several members of our party did not even get to eat as they ran out of many items, including rice and potatoes. Management was rude and condescending."}
{"text":"Very cool vibe and good food.  Not that many people inside, but it was also a Tuesday."}
{"text":"Eclectic delicious dining in Gastonia. Few places match this place I love lunch and dinner here for a treat."}
{"text":"Service wasn't up to par. Salad arrived without dressing for 15 minutes I sat there and couldn't eat it. Each meal came out one at a time by a wait staff runner. One meal came out cold and we waited forever to send it back. One pasta dish was requested without spice and the waitress assured us that it \"isn't spicy\". There was a good amount of hot red pepper used. She wasn't around to request another be cooked. I had to get up and give it to what assumed was an owner. I had to get up and ask for grated cheese because it was forgotten. We had gone to the restaurant that was previously there and had great service and food. It was an aggravating experience which we will not be repeating any time soon."}
{"text":"I expected to have a much better experience here!!!  Food was just ok, not much flavor, and no steaks??? The flan, not at all authentic more like a custard with a caramel sauce thrown on it, but.... It had good flavor. Now the wine selection is definitely not for those with a good wine pallot. Almost every wine could be purchased in Walmart for under $10.  I gave 2 stars because the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"A nice find. The service was great, the food was well thought out, colorful, and taste was superb. Had a wonderful time here and recommend it highly! The Sicilian pizza with all the toppings really hit the spot! They also  have a great Cobb salad. We started with a bread and oil / vinegar dipping appetizer  that came before our order. It was a fantastic beginning  that knocked it out of the park! Live music looks fun....perhaps next time."}
{"text":"Came here for the prime rib Saturday dinner special that everybody was constantly raving about. It comes with 2 sides and a glass of beer or wine. Not sure if there are restrictions on the type of beer that you can select, but for wine, you can only choose one of the Estrella wines or one other option, which I cannot recall the name of, but that's the one that I had and it was deliciously sweet. It tasted like apple juice. 1) The price increased from $15 to $18. You still receive a nice, huge slab of meat that takes up half the plate. However, 1/3 of my prime rib consisted of jiggly fat. Boyfriend received a beautiful piece of meat with far less fat, but his was cooked medium when he had requested medium rare. The meat was still juicy and tender for both of us, but I wish I had more meat. I felt that I had been gypped. 2) Many of the sides were unavailable because they had run out. Waitress said they receive groceries only once a week to last the entire week. I had grilled zucchini and mashed potatoes. Boyfriend had mac and cheese and brussels sprouts with bacon bits. The mashed potatoes lacked flavor. I would have liked it to be more creamy too. The mac and cheese was cold, so we asked them to reheat it. 3) There is an eclectic style to the venue. Very colorful design. I half expected incense and yoga-esque music to be filling the room. Overall, I was a bit disappointed with my experience, but it wasn't completely awful."}
{"text":"Three stars for the service, the chips, & hummus platter. The baked crab Mac and cheese was too salty and the old bay seasoning was overwhelming. The flatbread pizza tasted like a frozen pizza from the grocery store. Some of the items on the menu were no longer available.  The prime rib special was $15 include a beer or wine. Majority of customers in restaurant were ordering this special."}
{"text":"Olio's makes the BEST FLAN YOU'LL EVER EAT!  All of the dishes I've had are well prepared, but I go there to enjoy the Flan. Have dessert, first. You'll thank me."}
{"text":"Definitely a nice addition to Gastonia.  There are very few dining places that aren't chain restaurants.  Thank God we finally found something a little different.....and it is actually pretty good.  First off I have to say that the staff was incredible.  We had a super cute waitress that was extremely friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and on top of her game.  Every single person that walked by our table stopped by to speak ....from other wait staff to hostess to 3 different cooks.   I was thoroughly impressed with how nice everyone was.  The atmosphere was colorful and slightly busy in decor, however it was comfortable.  On to the food:  My BF got a Fried Green Tomato Sandwich that was on Foccacia bread served with home made chips with ranch dipping sauce.  He raved over his and how wonderful it was.  I tried his chips....and they were definitely perhaps the best chips I ever had.  After a tough decision between the Meatloaf and the Chicken Dijonaise.....I ended up with the chicken.  I kinda wish that I had had the meatloaf instead.  While my chicken was not dry.....what was on top of it was charred and burned to a crisp (I believe it was supposed to be onion).  At anyrate....I pushed the topping off and smeared the mustard on the chicken and ate it anyway.  The rice and the veggies were decent enough.  I would probably try something else next visit.  The absolute best part of the meal was dessert.   All desserts are made in house and they are awaiting you in the dessert cooler.  We chose the German Chocolate cake.  When it arrived to our table....it was the most colossal piece I've ever seen.  Big enough for 4 people.  The cake was somewhat dense and packed with flavor and texture.    I'm not sure I've ever experienced a GC cake quite like this before.    As we were eating our cake....the General Manager/Chef/Dessert Master brought us a complementary order of Caramel Flan fresh out of the oven.  It was Oooooh Soooooo Goooooood!  Warm, creamy, sweet and soft.....perfectly baked.  It was equally good as the GC cake.  All in all, the experience was worth going back for a second try.  We were both super happy and are excited about this new find.    Try it out, see for yourself.....and be sure not to skip dessert!"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in Gastonia that open in the old Rodi location. They have updated the place. This is the first time that we have eaten here and we will definitely be back. I had the Mushroom meatloaf and it was awesome. My wife had the Chicken Dijoneaise. For dessert we shared the Reese's peanut butter cake, can I say delightful."}
{"text":"Interesting place.   Very nice help.  Food is good, maybe not great but the quirky atmosphere makes up for it.  Good wine list.  Will come back for a casual, fun night out."}
{"text":"There is everything to be said of kindness and superbly tasting fresh food. Olio's serves up both with a passion for hospitality.  Their Cobb salad rocks with freshness: cranberries and avocado included! Vegan veggie soup a winner and custom made sandwiches fit the tastebuds. Food portions are generous & the ambiance is hipster with a Southern welcome.  We ventured here midday unaware it was post brunch, pre-dinner without a chef on site. Basically closed but we were greeted joyfully as I guided in my frail 91yr old relative, a newbie NC resident, who remembered this eatery from many years ago when her grandson worked there. The GM offered to welcome us in instead of easily turning us away between hours. He cooked up some homemade chips, the incredible Cobb, soup & sandwich and even put on some music for us, making this day memorable!  There's also a artisan display with item for purchase near the inner door and local artists work around the whole place. Choose Olio's! Spread the word!"}
{"text":"My sister and I celebrated National Pet Day by bringing her Shih-Tzu, Miss Penelope, to Olio's. The pita chips with garlic hummus, eggplant, and roasted peppers was amazing! I had a sweet potato burger with brussel sprouts & bacon that was so good!"}
