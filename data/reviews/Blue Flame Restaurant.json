{"text":"Blue Flame for Saturday breakfast!  Ended up trying the breakfast buffet -- most of things you would expect to see were there, except for sausage patties. I love sausage patties. I did have sausage links and they were good. The bacon was good. The french toast was okay. The eggs somehow felt disappointing, and the fried potatoes were downright terrible with a weird off flavor that reminded me of rancid oil. There were some fried dough balls that were rolled in cinnamon and sugar that were doughy and undercooked on the inside.   There was yogurt and cut up fruit, too, and that was good. Possibly the best part of my breakfast.   The service was okay, our waitress came by often enough to offer more coffee and take away dirty dishes. But the wait staff strangely mostly stood around gossiping and not doing much, and once in a while someone in an apparent position of authority blurted out, \"has anyone checked the buffet lately\".  The buffet and the dining experience was just off-putting enough that I doubt I'll be interested in going back."}
{"text":"Years ago, this was THE place to go for diner food. Went for breakfast one weekend, the buffet was truly awful, were those powdered eggs? Had lunch there a couple of months ago,  also very mediocre. Sorry, it is so dated, and the food was such poor quality, I won't go back."}
{"text":"What a let down. Had a fish dinner and it wasn't that good. Everything tasted like it was frozen. I can make better food at home. The only plus was that the crust on the the cod was nice and crispy. My sides were potato pancakes and veggies. The potato pancakes were obviously from a bag. I had hopes of fresh made crispy potatoes with sour cream dancing threw my head and I was let down. I also had a piece of the coconut cream pie. It was just ok. Nothing to write home about. I won't be back. There's better places in the area."}
{"text":"Sad and scary and just ew. What are they hiding with those blacked out windows? It looks more like a body shop/drug front than a restaurant."}
{"text":"I liked this place too, but a little less than Darren did. I probably should have ordered breakfast but had the poached lemon cod, which was pretty good and came with mashed potatoes and gravy. Dessert was amazing. It was a strawberry belgian waffle that was huge and decadent with real whipped cream! The Blue Flame is an old-fashioned, family joint, and there's nothing wrong with that."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot for breakfast.  It reminds me of old school dining.  The prices are very reasonable and you get a lot of food that is also really tasty!  I've been here twice and will go back again."}
{"text":"better than Denny's or Lennys whatever that place is called ... family run, good food, very diner atmosphere...  a treasure for our area... good dinners, very reasonable and good portions."}
{"text":"Note: The Blue Flame caters, has a banquet room, offers free Wi-Fi, features weekend specials (including a breakfast buffet), and holds a \"Murder Mystery Dinner\" once a month.   A fortnight prior, Kay and I were en route to Ruffsdale,PA to see a woman about adopting a dog, and my heart deflated when I saw the towering, time-worn sign and cartoonish mascot of The Blue Flame along with other such quirky-looking independent restaurants whizz by us as we traveled down Route 51. See, we opted for expedience and chose the Mexican chain known as Chipotle instead, but I swore that if we drove on this long stretch of highway again, we'd dine at The Blue Flame. This past Sunday, we did go to see the dog once more and made a stop at this restaurant a priority.   1956. It was the year Elvis Presley first conquered the Billboard Top 100, Morocco became independent of France, \"As The World Turns\" debuted on American television, Dwight Eisenhower won a second term as US President, the people of Hungary revolted against their own republic, Marilyn Monroe wedded Arthur Miller, Rocky Marciano retired, Jackson Pollock died, and The Blue Flame's burners were lit for the first time.   Before we ordered our food, I ran into a co-worker who lives in the area. Assuring me that home-styled goodness was imminent, he said, \"Everything here is real good. REAL good. Old-fashioned stuff. Me and the wife come here a lot.\"  Kay prevented me from ordering a burger yet again from BF's traditional, no-bells-and-whistles lunch menu, so I decided on The Flame's Steak Sandwich.   10 ounces of supple, seeping, sanguine, sizzling broiled sirloin are placed inside a springy bun along with lettuce, tomato, and grilled onion. And you need nothing else, except perhaps a knife and fork to render this sandwich into scraps, which I did ravenously and without pity. The bread and vegetables became peripheral, a flimsy armor for the seared and searing meat that I ate with the vigor of a berserker. The french fries were as crisp as crisp can be and surely were coated with a batter to make them all the crispier.  For dessert, I had a heap of Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Flapjacks that when topped with butter and nothing else, revealed themselves as the steaming bastard child of both cookie and cake I've always thought them to be. Fluffy, full-bodied, and emitting discharges of nutty, sugary goo, I wondered aloud how these could ever be considered a meal and not a treat.   Kay had a fish dish she seemed to like, and for dessert went for the Strawberry Belgian Waffle. Resembling a starship/fortress/castle dreamt up by a maddened, martial confectioner, the cushy waffle itself tasted of vanilla and possessed an easy chew. The saccharine impact of the strawberries was blunted a tad by turrets of whipped cream that tasted to have originated from a mixer and not a plastic tub or aerosol can.   The Blue Flame will not dazzle you with innovative, exotic delicacies. Nor will they attract Guy Fieri or Adam Richman with novelty, flair, or wackiness. They just do what they do without fanfare and have been doing it for over 55 years in a forgotten suburb. I hope they can withstand the encroachment of national franchises to stand for another half-century.   \"Real good,\" indeed. And often, \"real good\" is all you need. Blue Flame, keep on flickerin'."}
{"text":"A nice throwback to an old diner from the late sixties or early seventies, this place doesn't try to be too pretentious, or price itself out of its demographic.  They do diner food...and they do it well.  Friendly waitresses who are just attentive enough. without being annoying; and the food is served promptly.  Signature club for the wife, and turkey Devonshire for me.  Both very good.  Also talked to the co-owner for a bit...nice guy, whose dad bought the place in 1956.  He runs a nice place; definitely worth a stop for any meal if you're passing through the Century III Mall area, or anywhere near Clairton or Elizabeth."}
{"text":"Local Dennys or Eat and Park style restaurant. Food was OK."}
