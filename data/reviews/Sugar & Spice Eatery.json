{"text":"I love this place for their breakfasts!  The staff is friendly and the service is quick.  I have never had a item I didn't like and love the BIG pot of coffee they give you when you order!"}
{"text":"No joke, this is my favorite restaurant in the entire Madison area. This place is so down-to-earth and homey, friendly efficient staff, great food and good prices. Breakfast all day and they have a ton of (homemade?) desserts too, but I've always been too stuffed by their giant portion sizes to even consider trying another course."}
{"text":"The food and are both very good. The is scott and.will prepare your food just the way you like it.  So when you stop for dinner remember to ask scott to prepare food just the way you like it I'm sure you'll find it very good they also have a Deli  there and have some excellent prices and food in there as well.  so next time you go out in Stoughton give them a try I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

{"text":"Staff here are inattentive, rude, and out right don't care.  I was there once when staff were yelling, swearing, at someone who walked in.  Unprofessional.  Will not return, and suggest you turn around.  Food stinks and is expensive for what you get.  Poor, poor, poor!"}
{"text":"A reliable place, especially for breakfast and lunch.  The prices of their large menu are fair, and they have a large number of specials each day.  The service is friendly and generally speedy."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Sugar & Spice for many years. It has always been our source for a Mickey Mouse pancake when our kids were little and a reliably good burger for us.   There have been times when they were thin on staff, but even when super busy, we've always been treated remarkably well.    We're happy that this place has been a part of the community - serving up our diner favorites with a smile."}
{"text":"Every single thing I ordered was cooked perfectly. The waitress was very prompt and the food was brought to my table very quickly. The decor kept me interested in the short time it took the chef to prepare my breakfast. Yes chef when you can do the simple things with such skill you're a chef. I've been to fancier place that didn't cook half as well. So well done and if you want a breakfast cooked right go here."}
{"text":"My dad and girlfriend call this place \"the sisters\" because it's owned by two sisters. This is the first place I went to once getting into town. I enjoyed it. It's very small town, \"where everybody knows your name\", we walked in and they knew my dad's girlfriend and she got \"the usual\"  The food was good! I had intentions on going back to try the lunch/dinner but never made me way back. Next time I'm in town I plan to frequent them often. My dad and girlfriend got a few pies from there for Thanksgiving and apparently they weren't the only ones with the idea because the Wednesday before Thanksgiving they had several people coming by to pick up a lie or two."}
{"text":"Pretty utilitarian joint.   Reasonable priced, undifferentiated diner food.   Servers were nice, although food took awhile to come out.  Place was clean.   Not a place to go out of your way for but a fine diner if in the area."}
{"text":"Got the eggs, potatoes, meat and toast. The toast could had been more done. They gave you four slices of bacon which is good. Eggs weren't special, and the hash was decent. I would still come back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to have breakfast in Stoughton. I have been coming here for 20+ years. It is your classic old school diner. Whether you are a local or want to feel like a local stop in and grab a bite to eat. When you step inside you are taken back in time, with the d√©cor. Service is always on point and the servers are all super nice. Food is not over priced and always delicious. I can only speak to breakfast as I have never dined here for lunch or dinner.   If you come for breakfast expect a wait. They do not take reservations, or have a hostess. It's more of a first come first serve. You will notice people waiting sit at a dirty table before it is cleaned just to secure their spot."}
{"text":"5 of us came in for breakfast. Good food, mediocre service, and maybe a bit pricey for what it is, but not too bad. ($9 for a smallish omelette with toast, extra for homefries. Fresh ingredients. Two tables that arrived after us received menus and had their orders taken before us, and finished eating before our food arrived."}
{"text":"We love having breakfast here. We have always had good service. The waitresses are friendly and keep our drinks full. The food is hot and good. The prices are great for the amount of food you get. I've had the chocolate pie as well and it's wonderful."}
{"text":"This is by far the best breakfast spot in the area. The Eggs Beni is some of the best I havehad! The hash browns are crispy & perfect.  The service is top notch & fast.  We will be back! (Visiting from NC)"}
{"text":"Delicious diner breakfast food. We all leave happy. The husband craves the walleye, hashbrowns and eggs. I'm partial to the potato pancakes."}
{"text":"Waitress was very nice and attentive. Very enthusiastic about her job. My boyfriend got cheese curds as an appetizer and I tried some and we agreed they were some of the best we've had in a while, especially for the price. He got the double bacon cheeseburger with French fries as the side. We got an extra side order of fries and they ended up throwing them together on his plate and it looked like a single side order- portion sizes are very weird at this place, lol- on my plate, I had hash browns that were way bigger of a portion size than the fries. I got the egg, meat, potato, and toast. We ended up not finishing everything because he didn't like the burger and we both wanted to save room to try dessert. He got the snickers cheesecake which he said was very overpowering and I got apple pie which I ended up not liking. My boyfriend tried and also did not enjoy the pie. I asked for a box for my bacon to bring it home for my dogs and the waitress was a little rude about us not liking the food / taking it all home. Good service and good cheese curds but I know better places to go for the same if not cheaper prices. Just not for us."}
{"text":"This is a cute small-town diner. Stopped in  at 10:00 a.m. on a Sunday. The small place was really packed! Lots of families with small kids plus Senior couples.  I appreciated the many booths. Our server greeted us immediately with water and menus. Vast breakfast choices. I had the \"egg's with hash browns\" which came with toast. Opted for Cinnamon toast (yum). Wished later that I would've added cheese sauce to the hash browns...next time! My mate had the \"meat omelette\" with cheddar. It contained ham, bacon plus sausage. Both meals were very good and reasonably priced. Their dessert listing was extremely tempting (see photo).  Neat that they have a complete deli connected to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came in today for breakfast and everything was excellent as always! I love this place! It just feels like home :)"}
