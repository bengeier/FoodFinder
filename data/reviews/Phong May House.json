{"text":"My friend and I ordered dinners from this place, as we have for years, and will not EVER waste our money here again. The pork dumplings were made of mushy gooey thick dough with about 1/2 tsp. of nasty so called pork. See pix below. The egg roll I ordered was disappointingly about the size of my thumb, filled with grated carrots, and the outside was so hard and burnt I couldn't cut/bite it. The hot and sour soup is made with beef stock instead of chicken stock and did NOT contain any wood ears, bamboo shoots, pork, green onion/scallions or tofu! WTF... The fried rice was actually brown rice or burnt white rice had neither egg, baby peas, scallions, soy sauce nor roast pork, & did contain grated carrots. The slip called Szechuan scallops has two scallops cut into quarters with grated carrots and green peppers. WTF is that I ask? No ginger, no garlic, no scallions, no baby corn, no snow peas, no Chinese vegetables. I could have grated a carrot and 1/4 green pepper myself. WORST FOOD I've ever had in my 50+ years on this planet. Don't WASTE YOUR MONEY! I have to give it one star to be able to post this, otherwise NO STAR & I'd tell these people to get out of this business or get your Chinese grandparents back in there cooking."}
{"text":"Not good. Too expensive for portion size. Generic brown sauce thrown in with different veggies to make different dishes. Chicken was white meat but breading(Gen Tso) was soggy.  Rice was poor quality and dumplings were generically terrible...served with, what seemed like, soy sauce! Egg drop was raw??? Wont be wasting any more money here."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here twice now and been disappointed both times. Food is all the same deep fried chicken with different sauces. I got general tso and my wife got sesame chicken and the only difference was sesame seeds on top. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I really like their food. I'm a very picky eater and they always get my order perfect. Their curry is, by far, the best around and my favorite. They're also speedy and quick. If you're hungry NOW and are in the mood for Chinese definitely order here."}
{"text":"Bland and flavorless food. I ordered the wonton soup and moo goo gai pan. Pretty disappointing and overpriced. I will definitely try the other nearby Chinese place next time, which is supposedly flavorful AND cheap. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Good decent  food 
always  delivered  with fast, good service. Maybe not the Best in da Burgh but prices good for  just some many traditional dishes,  all done well.   Generous  portions, good value."}
{"text":"Delivery was quick and the food was tasty! We had chicken lo mein and Singapore chow may fun. We were very satisfied, generous portions"}
{"text":"The restaurant is not one you can really sit in. You have to order out and pick it up. It is not a bad thing. I don't mind coming back to eat at home.
I only ordered the Crab Rangoon and fantail shrimp. The food was ready in about 15 minutes. 

I brought it home and it was still very warm. The Rangoon was nice a creamy! They gave me sweet and sour sauce and there was enough for all 8 pieces. The piece was pretty big too. The shrimp was crunchy and there was a good ratio of shrimp and batter on the outside

I will be coming back to try other things on the menu because what I ordered was pretty good."}
{"text":"I would actually give Phong May House an extra half-star in the rating. But for the most part it is pretty generic, leaning on sub par Chinese food. Yet I ate there plenty when I first lived in Pittsburgh, and have frequented it since moving back. So why?

Sadly, the best reason I can come up with is \"because I got used to it.\" Now, I never expect mind-blowing greatness from quick and cheap local Chinese delivery joints. They all kind of fall in the same sort of area, much like Chinese buffets do. You basically know what to expect, though each place's wonton soup and egg rolls are usually the differing factor.

Phong May, for the most part, must use what Woody Allen once called a \"deflavorizor.\" The wonton soup broth barely has any hint of flavor to it, the sweet and sour sauce used in various dishes is thin and also treading into the bland territory. The cashew chicken should be so much better. But Phong May uses tenderized, flatter pieces of chicken and oft times the cashews seem like they're just thrown on top at the end and not actually cooked into to the dish.

And the General Tso's...another one of those should be a little crispy but winds up mushy deals. I dunno. You're probably wondering how I can give it any stars let alone two and a half after this write up. The thing is, though, sometimes Phong May just hits the right spot and is tasty despite all its shortcomings.

Sometimes the cashew chicken is spot on. I do like the sweet and sour pork over the sweet and sour chicken, even though they both have the same bland sauce. The Szechuan wontons are really good. I think they cook theirs in some peanut butter along with the hot oils, which a place in Philly also used to do, and it is something I definitely like. The orange beef, though a little pricey, is as good as I've had at other places.

The egg rolls? They're standard. Just fine.

I would say Phong May is like a Taco Bell of Chinese food. You know that what you're getting isn't going to be spectacular, but it does fill a spot in your gut that sometimes can only be filled with its particular brand of flavor. Most people I've introduced to Phong May have been rightly underwhelmed. As I said, I grew accustomed to its bland shortcomings some time ago. And apparently they have enough fans as the place is still there. Mind you, I wouldn't actually take the time to eat there, and I'd say 99% of their business is either take out or delivery. And the people who work there are good folk and friendly. So don't go in expecting amazing and you might find something you find acceptable as well.

Man, that's not much of a compliment, is it? Ah well, it's decent when it's good is the best way I can put it."}
{"text":"I aree with the prior posts, this food is the definition of mediocre. I've had good Chinese food and bad Chinese food and their food is right in the middle. There's nothing notably good or bad about it. Honestly it's kinda weird everyone has had the same experience as though they are intentionally striving to be perfect tly mediocre. I tried the Singapore chow mai fun - noodles were a little dry, decent enough flavor after I added salt Fried dumplings - thick dough but overall ok Shrimp eggroll - kinda dry as though it had been cooked then reheated. I agree the price is too high for both portion and quality. At any other neighborhood place I would have gotten a plastic container with twice as much vrs a large rice container. Would go back if having killer craving for Chinese food but definitely would not recommend."}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE!  I ordered egg drop soup which was really just raw eggs in a bowl and smelled terrible.  I also had the General Tso sauce over tofu and it tasted like horse jizz!  3 bites in and I tossed the whole meal.  A waste of $15 and I am still hungry."}
{"text":"This place delivers good tasting food at reasonable prices. We've been customers for years. YMMV."}
{"text":"I read the reviews, and should have listened.  I ordered delivery anyway because I really wanted \"Chinese\" food, and was stuck at work.  The food came much faster than I expected, which was great.

I ordered the house fried rice and the beef stick app.  The fried rice was just ok.  But the beef sticks were so gross.  I have no idea how anyone could make food that bad.  I think it's nearly impossible to make beef taste as bad as this.  

I can't believe I spent $18 on this meal, not including the tip for the driver."}
{"text":"We've ordered here twice now and both times our meals were excellent.  We got take-out: Shrimp lo mein, pork with garlic sauce.... Veggies are fresh and crisp, nice flavors, etc. Ready to pick up in 10 minutes both times."}
{"text":"It's a hole in the wall. It's great for take out or delivery.

I've been twice and each time I've been more than impressed with this place. I found it by accident while I was in Pittsburgh for work and I will probably be back again.

I got the Hot and Sour soup and the Beef and Broccoli (and the General Tso's Chicken on another occasion). The lunch portion is a generous portion (I don't get rice and I'm still usually full) and the giant size of Hot and Sour soup is only like $3. And it's good. I don't know, but I don't think it's made from bouliion cubes. However, I don't know, it could just be good.

And they deliver. I don't know if it's free and I don't know how far, but they do. Give 'em a call and find out."}
{"text":"Great take out, quick, and reasonable! Option of grilling chicken instead of deep frying, great lunch specials and combo meals. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"The outside of the store, the inside, and the previous Yelp reviews didn't instill a lot of confidence in my dinner choice this evening. But it was convenient, I was tired, and it was worth a shot. 

The interior is a bit odd and not what you expect.  There is a small counter where you order and a large waiting room off to the opposite side.  There are three total items hanging on the wall (one of which is the menu) and four chairs for the waiting area.  Outside of this, there isn't anything else. 

Since I was the only person there my order was taken quickly and was ready in roughly 5 mins.  

I agree with other reviews that the fried rice is... different. It has a mild flavor and doesn't quite taste like any other I've had.  It's not bad.  Imagine Spanish rice without the beans.  

I ordered the garlic chicken.  It had a redish sauce that does have a garlic taste but also seems to have a heavy taste of red hot.  It's closer to a boneless chicken wing than any Chinese I've had before.

The egg rolls were very crispy.  They actually were the most flavorful item in the dinner.  

I had relatively low expectations and I can say they were met.  It isn't terrible.  It really isn't cheap.  But when in a pinch it's okay."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I have EVER had! The chicken lomein is more like chicken flavored ramen noodles! The Szechuan chicken was all just shredded veggies with like 3 pieces of chicken.

First and last time we will ever eat here! Worth the drive to go ANYWHERE else for Chinese."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Pittsburgh.  General Tso's chicken was the best I've had.  The service was top-notch.  Food was ready in 10 minutes."}
{"text":"It's a tiny takeout place in the shopping center. On the day I moved into the area, I stopped by for a quick dinner and ordered the house pan fried noodles, with fried rice on the side. The staff was really friendly and took my order with a smile.

I waited for about ten minutes and they handed me my food. I was so excited about living near all these food places and eager to try the pan fried noodles--one of my favorite dishes. I got home and opened up the cartons to find two containers full of fried rice. Lo and behold, they'd taken my order wrong, and I got the house fried rice...with a side of fried rice. Both just sorta ok.

I'm sure my food would have been better if I'd gotten what I actually ordered. Willing to try again, but I'll be triple checking to make sure they wrote down what I asked for!"}
{"text":"Now I've never tasted \"horse jizz\".. But.. It is a \"hole in the wall\". 
 When I tried it  once last year , I was pleased. However, I ordered 3 days ago & while delivery was super fast? The food quality suffered. Szechuan beef was really good! Cashew chicken lacked seasoning, as did beef teriyaki (on a stick, appetizer) and chicken fingers. The Beef & broccoli?? Broccoli was too mushy. 
. Their prices have gone up about a buck fifty per item, yet the quality/flavor is .. Suffering!! Out of a $47 order? The only other decent items were the chicken soup and wonton soup. 
I like that they deliver but if quality doesn't get better? I'm afraid I'll never order again. Instead I'll drive down to the Red Tea House @ 1717 Cochran Rd."}
{"text":"Hands down the WORST Chinese food I've EVER HAD. I ordered the crab Rangoon- stale, and unfortunately must have been fried in stale oil- IT WAS AWFUL. Hot and sour soup- hot- as in warm, yes, but other than that, COMPLETELY TASTELESS. Beef with garlic sauce- I don't know what it was that I got. I'm speechless because I really don't understand how this place is still open. I'm dumbfounded. Please PLEASE PLEASE go through McDonald's drive through instead because I just threw out $20 worth of food."}
{"text":"I work in the WDVE building so I order from them about once a week. It's great Chinese food in my opinion. They're always prompt with delivery and friendly when I pick up!"}
