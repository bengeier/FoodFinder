{"text":"Almost each time I eat there, my stomach feels bad because food is too oily and greasy (ordered pasta carbonara, veggi samosas, burger with fries at different times) but my boyfriend likes it. Breakfast items were at the very good level. Don't take apple pie. 
Prices are fine and service is fast."}
{"text":"We've lived in the neighbourhood for years but always overlooked this spot (which has re-branded and is now called \"Kingston Gourmet\"). What a gem! It's tiny, but cozy (two tables for dining in, but they also do take out and delivery) and the owner/chef, Gulam, truly cares about the food he prepares. I had a fabulous spaghetti carbonara and my husband loved his lamb curry. Don't walk past this one - go in and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food is quite good and the staff are very friendly. (Every time I order, they thank me for my business which isn't something you hear too often) Not much to the look of the place and agree with other reviewers that this place is for take out. 
We've had a few dishes including the fish and chips, BLT, burgers. They have a super cheap breakfast for around 3 or 4 bucks.  It's a little small but it's under 5 dollars, so can't really complain about the size. If you're in that area and looking for some good diner style take out, I would really recommend."}
{"text":"Had the fish and chips. Damn good and very nice people. Total hidden gem."}
{"text":"We ordered Pizza yesterday, it was burnt and tasteless. When we called the answer we got was \"that is the way it comes\". I understand that the edges could be a little burnt but most of the bottom should not be.

I suggest you try somewhere else if you want Pizza!"}
{"text":"Great place and recently renovated with an updated menu (fresh fries vs frozen) that sort of tweak to make things fresh. 

Menu is very eclectic so there's pretty much something for everybody and prices are very fair.

The staff always thank you for your business which is a nice touch.

Hope the renos bring in more business for this little gem - they deserve it!"}
{"text":"Yelp let us down. 

My wife and I ordered from Star of Kingston using justeat.ca. We thought, based on the interviews, that the food would be tasty. We were sadly disappointed. 

I ordered the butter chicken and she ordered a napoleon pizza. Because we had a coupon we decided to get an order of onion rings as well. 

The butter chicken wasn't terrible; it was watery, and no better than what I get in a bottled grocery store butter chicken sauce, but it wasn't terrible. The portion was massive with the rice. The onion rings were cool when the food arrived (and we're very nearby!) and had a gross fishy taste to them. They were edible but not appealing. 

The pizza was a travesty. There were multiple calls between us and the restaurant because they didn't know how to make it! Apparently they changed their menu but it isn't updated on justeat, so I had to walk them through the items of the pizza. While that was annoying, it was understandable. The problem was the restaurant absolutely loaded the pizza with anchovies, to the point where the pizza was almost inedible. We threw out more than half of it. 

I can't warn people away from this place enough. Based on our experiences we'll never spend another dime here again."}
{"text":"Looking at this place from the outside, you might never go in.  It's tiny, and has only a few tables.  I think they make their money on take out and delivery.

An eclectic menu includes everything from pizza to pasta to fish and chips.  These Indian owners have recently added a new cuisine...Indian!

We've only ordered pasta...even for company, and have never had a bad meal.

If you've been scared off by the unappealing storefront, give 'em a call and giver a try!  It's at the north end of Waverley, in the Upper Beach."}
{"text":"Does not disappoint!!! Amazing service and food, we just had the allo gobi, chicken biriyani and butter chicken ...... All was amazing !"}
{"text":"Great little place on Kingston! I think it's been re-branded as Kingston Gourmet in the last couple of weeks. We just moved into the neighbourhood and my boyfriend and I decided to check it out to see what is was about as we saw the makeover happening. 

Happy surprise! Reasonably priced and delicious. A bit of an odd menu with Indian, Italian, and burger-fare, but delicious.

We had veggie samosas while we waited and took a margarita pizza to go. Both had a bit of a spice kick to them (I have zero spice tolerance) for me, but just right for my boyfriend (who loves spicy). I highly recommend checking them out. The owner is very sweet and nice as well.  We plan on showing more support to this little local place."}
