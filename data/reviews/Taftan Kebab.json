{"text":"I strongly suggest that 'the owner' of Taftan is kept away from customers until he is educated on the art of customer care.   Apparently the owner has become notoriously famous for his dictatorship behavior against his own workers and harsh attitude against customers. He is firing his workers every few months. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"BEWARE! I have gotten violently ill from being served raw/undercooked chicken at Taftan. My friend and I ordered 2 orders of the chicken breast kebab dinner (number 6 on the menu) in the evening on Sunday, May 11, 2014. I was almost done eating my dinner before I realized I had ingested a plate full of raw chicken. When I cut open the very last piece of chicken on my plate, I realized the chicken piece was cold and pinkish and had a raw texture.   I immediately alerted the woman who had taken our order and she saw and acknowledged the piece of raw chicken and agreed that it was raw. She then tried to offer us another order as compensation. We refused as we had lost our appetites at this point. My friend and I got food poisoning the very next evening and have since been bedridden and unable to eat or drink anything. I have reported this establishment to Toronto Public Health and I will not let this just slide.  I also noticed after the meal that the cooks were not wearing proper sanitary gloves and hair nets. This place is unsanitary, dirty and the food is improperly handled and cooked. This place needs to be shut down immediately. Please BEWARE AND STAY AWAY. Not worth taking 3 days off of work for."}
{"text":"Food: C+ Service: C Food presentation: C- Atmosphere: C Prices: B+ Recommended?:  Not really, unless, you want cheap and quick and you're close by.   I ordered the beef kabob and the chicken kabob and as a Persian I wasn't too thrilled. The kabobs were dry and the beef kabob was loaded with copious amount of bread crumbs and high fat ground meat. Everything in here is pretty much the definition of mediocrity."}
{"text":"The Taftan Kabab's Kabab Koobideh is one of the best among Persian restaurants in the whole GTA area. I have ordered twice for large parties (50+) and they delivered right on time with the best quality food imaginable.  My Wife and I also have this routine that we bug one Koobideh meal (plus one additional skew) for the two of us, and ask for \"Tahdig\" with the stew of the day. It is delicious, and for the price of around 12 bucks, worth much than any other food or fast food you can get."}
{"text":"Get barg or/and chicken! Super large portion, smokey taste. Moist and tender. Overall pretty good, 4.5/5. Go when its busy so they constantly have big charcoal fire going on, taste even better!"}
{"text":"Best Taftan I've ever been to.  The portions are generous and the smokiness in their meats is off the charts! You can smell it from restaurant and taste it your food.  Can't beat it, I go there once in awhile when I'm in the area.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I would give them zero stars if I could  I found a house fly in my rice in my daughters spoon when she was about to take a bite we went back to the store and showed the food with fly to the owner with no intentions of getting more food or my money but the owners argued with us and said that we put the fly in there ourselves"}
{"text":"I have tried quite a few kabob houses in Richmond Hill and I had been frequenting  a specific  establishment over the years. Unfortunately my usual restaurant was closed tonight. I have no idea if it's closed for good or just this evening and now it doesn't really matter because my new favorite Persian restaurant is Taftan.  I was referred to Taftan by a friend. The food was absolutely delicious!! It was fresh, flavourful and cooked to perfection and the portion sizes were as I expected. I had the Vaziri and my friend had the Barg. Both meals were excellent. I highly recommend this  restaurant. I know I will now  be a regular customer!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food but the experience was overall poor. Sometimes they charge more for some items especially if you do not know the place or if you do not know the language. The food is amazing but the staff can be very rude, I always order from them but even still the experience is often poor due to poor customer service. Their menu is also outdated because all of the prices changed (that is the excuse I get when I am charged more than the price listed)"}
{"text":"It is fantastic. To me it is authentic persian takeout. A lot like the kabob places near my old university in tehran. The prices are quite fair considering the size of food and the added salad and occasional free second meal (Tah-dig) and stew."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the bests if you're fan of persian food and kebab. The place is not appropriate for sitting with family and there's limited seat, but the quality of the food is very good. It is more like a kitchen than restaurant, we always buy the food 'to go'."}
{"text":"The food is ok, pricey for the portion, but the service is below average. Close to mediocre.   I did not come here expecting 5 star, hotel like service, but a smile never really hurts the customer.   To make things a little more interesting, and to cement the below average attitude towards service the owner turned off half the lights of the store, the OPEN sign, and the TV \"while I was watching looool\" 45 minutes before their closing time.   Who turns off the lights at their shop at 9.15 when they are supposed to be open until 10.00??!!  This was the second time, in eight months, that I had food at this place and I know I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Alwaaaays get the kaboodeh. The chicken was flavourful and so was the lamb...and beef... Dead farm animals taste so good. Will honor you by not wasting a single morsel on my plate. Some people commented the the meat was on the drier end but, I did not find this to be the case.   Food is cooked on a charcoal grill made-to-order so, would recommend calling in advance. Can always smell the yumminess on my way home.   Even when you do call in advance, you have to wait at least 5-10 minutes...they definitely need more people working at the front...Assuming this is a place for take out because the lady at the register is answering the phone for take-out orders (which is constantly ringing around dinner time) and dolling out orders. So...patrons beware...it is a bit of a wait. Would give it a 4/5 but the wait is usually so long, that I leave a tad irritated..."}
{"text":"This is recommended by is a friend that knows this kind of food.  We ordered a lot for a big party.   The chicken kebobs is a lot tender than those offered by Mevame.  The beef kebobs, however, is unexpectedly minced beef.  The rice is tasty.   Although highly recommended by the friend, I found it to be average."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Persian kabobs.  Normally hit up Tehran supermarket but as they are closed for renovations, I had to have my fix Saturday night so was cruising the \"strip\" on Yonge and guided by the Yelp reviews of Taftan, gave it a try.  We ordered a dozen kabobs (chicken breast and barg) a la carte with grilled tomatoes and a couple sides of rice.  Our order was packaged and ready in 12 minutes.  Not bad.  The food was awesome, as good or better than Tehran. The following Saturday we placed the same order.  When we got home, we were shocked to see the tomatoes (juicy, charcoal broiled and delicious) were missing!  I immediately called the restaurant and although they apologized, they would not deliver the missing tomatoes, to our great disappointment.  The weekend manager, Majid, assured us he would \"make it up to us\" the following weekend.  Had I been the manager, I would have delivered the tomatoes AND given the customer something on the house - like the whole order!  Unfortunately, the manager's generosity was limited to a side of rice - a $7 value according to him.  I'll have to think twice about going back now.  Also worth mentioning: the prices are 20-30% higher than Tehran's."}
{"text":"One of the best Persian take away restaurants in the city. Koobideh is great and the chicken isn't under cooked like in a lot of other places I've tried. Well cooked and overall decently healthy. Looking forward to them including a brown rice option."}
{"text":"They say they have a delivery service on their menu and site but every time I call for delivery they say \"ohh delivery is not possible today\""}
{"text":"There food quality has gone down for the past 5-6 years. The last couple of stories I heard and experienced twice myself was hair being in the food and the people pretend it's smoke from the grill.  They messed up our order so many times it's ridiculous.  I wouldn't go back here at all! Considering the amount of clean kabob places !"}
{"text":"If you walk by this place you will be lured in by the fragrant scent of grilled meat (unless you're a vegetarian).  The meat is flavourful and the prices are great.  Sometimes the service is a little chaotic, but it's a reliable choice for a healthy, tasty and affordable meal."}
{"text":"rude staff , poor and slow service. there is nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"Nothing special  Not the best middle eastern food  that I have eaten.   There are other alternatives in the area that is better off going too."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Amazing food for reasonable price. I order take out from this place frequently! Quality of food is always great! I love the chicken leg kebab. My boyfriend loves the koobideh. We both like this place a lot."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Tiny little place with a big tasty punch!  The portions are huge and the price is fair! I got combo #15. (Koobideh kebab, comes with rice and salad).   It does take a little bit of time to make, so better to pre-order and pick up, but f you have time to spare worth waiting there.   The staff are all super friendly."}
{"text":"Best koobideh in Richmond Hill and they have over 6000 combos to choose from.  If your looking for good Persian food at a good price than this is the joint."}
{"text":"Service is good, always delicious food i would recommend ordering ahead for pickup! My fav is the koobideh!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. The lady taking orders was pretty accommodating. We ordered the Chicken Breast, Barg & Koobideh kebab with rice and salad with intent on sharing, and they were willing to provide extra rice upon request as well as two separate plates.  Metal cutlery is available up front. Plastic ones are also available, so you're now forced to make an environmentally-aware decision in front of all your dining companions.  It's a small restaurant with seating along the wall. There are various bottles of sauces lying around, so if you want to try them out you may have to walk around to grab them.  You can watch them grill your meats fresh, served hot, but chances are if you're sitting down you'll probably be staring at a wall or out the window.  The rice was tasty. Meats were nice and juicy, well-seasoned. I'm not really sure what kind of meats I was eating, but they had an interesting texture.  For a two-person portion, I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Sweet sassy molassy, this is some tasty food!   My friend brought me in here for dinner. They have a large range of food, all of which is cooked on a shish kebob. Combos are served with delicious rice and salad. We came in here on a Wednesday night, and it was busy as hell. The only drawback of the place is that there isn't much seating, and the seating they have is takeout style - high counters with bar stools -  not very comfy. But the food is so good, it really doesn't matter. I would eat this stuff sitting on the sidewalk.  I would eat it in a box, I would eat it with a fox.  On the counters are napkins, Italian salad dressing, sumac powder, lemon juice, and Frank's red hot sauce. I love to drown my salad in dressing, so I was pretty happy about this. One bite into my giant platter of food and I was in heaven. My mom has the exact same platters and we use them as serving dishes. There was easily two meals of food on this dish for me.  At $13.50 taxes in, that's a bargain! I had the beef shish kebab and the... thing that's like ground meat. (combo 15). Everything was perfectly grilled.  I just know that I'm going to be craving this place for the next few weeks, so I'll definitely be back soon, with my wrap-loving Hubster in tow!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and it was fairly busy. The restaurant is small with limited seating along the side of the store. There is a small wooden deck outside that could fit around 6 people. It looks old and dirty inside, but smells like charcoal grilled meat.   It smells delicious, but I ordered combo 12 ($12.42 after tax; chicken breast on rice) and I found the chicken to be quite dry. The rice was bland but at least it was cooked well. It could've been quite different had there been sauce with the rice or chicken.  I had high hopes for this restaurant and I was greatly disappointed. Needless to say, I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"It's hard to miss this place as you walk down Yonge street. Sometimes you can smell the BBQ from the street and you'll suddenly feel hungry. I have a growing addiction to Persian food. Their kebobs have this awesome smoky flavor to it. Their rice is so fluffy. Recently I discovered their stews and I'm very happy that they serve stews here for a reasonable price.  I had their kebobs + rice and salad combos several times. It's delicious. Like many Persian places, you can expect tons of rice and mouth watering kebobs. You can get various cuts of meat ranging from ground beef to steak, chicken leg or chicken breast. They also have lamb.   What really made me write a review was the stew. I had fesejan (spelling?) at Pomegranate Restaurant for $15 + tax and tip. Here it's $9 + tax!! But I have to admit it doesn't taste as amazing though. But it's passable and I'd definitely order it again. I'll try the other stews too! The stews don't look appetizing but if the fesejan was any indication, they must be super delicious.   Prices are on par with the other Persian places in the area. They don't give you free pop but that can be overlooked. After a year, I still prefer Super Khorak's kebobs since they are on average cheaper and comes with a pop (but no salad). But if I want stews, Taftan is the place to go.   Recommended!"}
{"text":"Great Dishes...aromatic, fresh and delicious!  I don't like the Koobideh, Ive had much better....the rest is suberb!"}
{"text":"The beef kebab and rice tasted pretty alright but without garlic sauce or any sort of sauce, it was sort of bland. Making it worse, they seemed to have run out when I asked so while the food wasn't bad by any means, I wasn't exactly head over heels over it. Still decent enough though in its own right."}
{"text":"Teftan is very good! I love the Koobideh and the chicken leg kabobs. They have very flavourful food with very good prices."}
{"text":"Always busy around dinner time so you should really go early or late at night if you don't want to wait. I usually get the kobideh (spelling?) kebab thing. They give you a generous portions with rice, salad and broiled tomatoes. All for $10 and I can barely finish it all. The meat itself is cooked over charcoal bbq with the fanning technique by hand!   It's a small place that's meant for takeout. The food is claimed to be low calorie and it tastes pretty damn good too!"}
{"text":"I love this place, they serve better food than some of the other upscale Iranian restaurants"}
{"text":"Been going to the joint for a few yrs now. I have to say the first time I had it I immediately fell in love with Persian food. I've tried the chicken, steak and koobideh kebab. The koobideh is by far my fav always juicy, fresh, flavourful meat. The dinner comes with salad, rice and 2 skewers of the koobideh. This is enough for me for 2 meals and it's so cheap! I love the free side they give sometimes (tadeek). If you haven't tried this place you should definitely give it a try!!! There's not much seating so take out is best here and I would recommend that you order a head as the wait time is a little long as they cook the kebabs fresh when ordered on the flame grill."}
{"text":"I asked for a special surprise on Valentine's Day and I sure got what I asked for, although definitely not what I had in mind!  Located in a small strip mall beyond Laser Quest, the restaurant had very little sitting area, had the smell of freshly grilled meats fuming into the waiting area and was not very well decorated. We also waited a good 10 minutes for our food. Was it worth it? ABSOLUTELY!  My husband's idea of a wonderful date is good food and there is no doubt that this place serves high quality food. The herbs and spices used on the chicken and lamb kebobs were simple yet very flavorful. Generous portions of rice and vegetables were also served with our meal.  Given the freshness of the food (cooked over charcoal) and the portions given, I would say that prices were reasonable but not cheap, ranging about $10-15 dollars per plate.  Would definitely recommend to those who enjoy a good bite but it is certainly not a romantic place!"}
{"text":"I came here late at night just this week to get some food; I all of a sudden got a craving for a Kebab after catching a movie. They were actually closing, it was that late, but it smelled so good inside the store. I ordered a chicken and a beef kebab with rice a salad and of course some flat bread. As soon as I got home my family and I devoured everything! It was really delicious; I'm not even sure if it was that we were so hungry or that the kebab from this place are just that good? The owner is in the store while we were there and he was super friendly and attentive, the entire kitchen staff stayed back a few minute later just so they could get our food cocked, I was very pleased and impressed at the level of customer service the whole staffed showed! The professionalism and courtesy was what made me give them a five star rating! Thanks everyone."}
{"text":"If you go to this place just order their Barg or chicken kababs. Do not try to be adventurous as they have a long menu and you will be pleased. Their Barg is one of the best I have had.  I usually go to Bamiyan Kebobs for my kabab cravings. I went here simply to explore Toronto's kabab variety.  The koobideh or lamb chops are pretty average. The lamb chops are very thin and loaded with sour vinegar. The price to me is an issue as they have no decent sitting arrangement. Bamiyan Kebobs have nice dining area with similar pricing and a better tasting menu."}
{"text":"Rude costumer service. They are so unprofessional and treat costumers like animals. You feel this when any issue happens in your order or in thejr service."}
{"text":"Tasty, fresh and made to order. We have been regulars for many years, and have not been let down on taste, quality or quantity.  Not 5 stars only because they don't offer all types of payments last time I've been there, cash only.  The prices have been increased, but it's expected. We always get take-out, however there are bar stools and wall tables to eat there, for a quick meal/snack kind of seating.   The local area always has a strong barbecue smell, very tasty smell, and it's Taftan that is responsible!"}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall and a fast food place. The service is quick, food is cheap but I question the sanitary aspect of it.   There is a sign outside of the restaurant posted by Ontario Ministry of Health giving it only a \"Conditional Pass\" during their last inspection due to health hazards.  This is indicative of a dirty restaurant and you can possibly get sick eating the food here.  I recently went there and ignored the failed inspection notice. I got some \"Koobideh Kebob\" to go and when I got home, there was a big surprise waiting for me in my food: A Long Black Hair right in my salad. The meat was also under cooked and raw in the middle. I threw the food away and will never eat here again.  The only reason why I think people are giving this place high rating is because of the price. The price is a couple of bucks cheaper than your average take out place (for kebobs), but it comes at a cost: Getting Sick, dirty food, bad service and no parking.   I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Horrible quality , unclean environment , unprofessional staff . what else can I say .I paid more than $15 for \" berg kebob \" witch was too chewy and burned out . the funny thing is I asked the person on the phone to suggest me the most tender kebob ( red meat ) that I can get  and I asked for a medium - well done cook . quality of the rice was awful as well .I wasn't expecting the best rice that I can get but ,at least something decent . I called and left my order so I can quickly pick it up , but it seems like they are not willing to prepare your order until you pay for it . ( they kept me waiting for at least 20 minutes )  I was looking around while waiting for my food and I wish I wasn't . the place is sooo unclean it almost made me sick. stain of grease is all over the menus even on the daily menu witch is on the wall behind the counter .( grossssss )  I even noticed one of the people who was preparing orders in the kitchen dropped one of the chicken kebob's piece on that filthy counter and quickly put it back on the rice . I wish I could do 0 star for my review but since 1 star is the minimum ,I have to go with 1 star . anyways , that was my first and last time ."}
{"text":"The worst experience I ever had among resturants. Even 1 star is too much. Worst customer service and dirty environment. Even they didn't fix the broken peel infront of the shop and when I noticed about it, they didn't applogize. It was very dangerous for my kid when he was playnig around. Very rude staff. As a persian I am ashamed."}
{"text":"Only good for take out.  Rice is very good, so are grilled tomatoes and their koobideh. I'm not a fan of their chicken dish, too much fat, hard to chew."}
{"text":"The 1 star may be a little harsh, however it is pretty deserving.  Place is unclean, the prices are a touch high compared to other locations, the quality is definitely not there. Rice was really bland, koobideh was tough and chewy (So weird) and it didn't have that nice charcoal smokey flavour. It tasted like natural gas.  The salad dressing smelled like a wet bathing suit that's been in a plastic bag for a month. Let alone it tasted like pure artificial lemon juice.   Finally, how can a Iranian/Persian establishment run out of Doogh? (The sparking/salty yogurt drink). WTF? It's like Mcdonalds running out of Coca-cola, or a chinese restaurant not having soy sauce...   Travel a little more north (Between Finch and Morgan Ave) and you will find much better restaurants, with more selection of food, better quality and better prices."}
{"text":"you know what?! \"unknown diamond\" i think they making best chicken kebab in the world not kidding seriously, tasty and succulent ! It's located at the northeast corner of Yonge and Weldrick. Enter the plaza off Weldrick to find it easier. they have 16 combo choices for you but they always making just one of the  \"khoresht\"  (i don't know we have something like this in English) every day of  week you can check by telephone what they have today?! including: \"Ghaimeh\", \"Ghorm-e-sabzi\" (both my favorites) \"phesenjoon\"(walnuts and chicken breast) \"karafs\"(celery)  and chicken breast (you know that it's not khoresht!) as well with a salad(mediterranean style with feta/olives/etc) all with Persian rice served (I'm not sure about Persian it should named Pakistani or basmati or Indian or... what ever it is, its different with east Asian it's not that much sticky like them longer and a little lighter). kebabs such as:  Chencheh grilled beef Mirfakhraee grilled beef  Koobideh(about this one its a little dry but it use to be succulent!) Joojeh Bakhtiari chicken( the top one ) Salari ground meat  Barg Kebab Vaziri chicken kebab Soultani beef and Taftan Kebab. you can order kebabs with rice and a separate salad or with bread and salad together. a royal sandwich of chicken kebab with salad just for 4.99 $! don't forget to serve special Iranian drink with your food \"doogh\" yogurt and water and a little salt and something else making that amazing ask of waiter about and that discover something new! It's more of a take out place with a couple counters and about 6 stools the same as pizza novas in Richmond Hill. go and enjoy your Persian food!"}
{"text":"I've walked by this place for years, smelling their most amazing food, and finally ducked in. I can only add to the raves. Cheap, good food. Not great on seating and if you're looking for a place filled with lonely middle aged men you'll find a delightful concentration here Friday or Saturday night.   Props to the $4.99 chicken kebab dish. First, a meal for under $5. And it's nicely filling. Chicken, pita, salad. If you're one of the lucky ones to come here with a human female, get one of cheaper items and one of the combo plates with rice and share. Really filling."}
{"text":"Just delicious! So glad they opened another location in Oak ridges, Amazing price for delicious kebobs or chicken with a few other traditional Persian dishes."}
{"text":"This is a small place, which doesn't accommodate dining in really well. I get take out from here sometimes. It's pretty good. Not as pricey as some of the competitors in the area. They get pretty busy in the evenings, so even when i call in an order and show up 15 mins later, I still have to wait when i get there - other then that, i'm a fan and also a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing hole in the wall Kabab shop in Richmond Hill. It's was busy as always but the food didn't take too long. Ordered the koobideh Kabab with rice and salad. Prices were reasonable and the service and price point were great as well. If you looking for a fast, tasty Kabab in a no frills environment then this is your spot."}
{"text":"Good food from this place on my birthday. Food is really good but you have to make sure if order over the phone person who took your order confirmed it unless you speak Farsi I believe there would be no misunderstanding. Other than that service is good and as I mention food is fresh. Good luck!"}
{"text":"I always get #18 which is the koobideh and chicken combo that comes with rice and salad for $12.99. Food always tastes fresh, which is probably why it takes about 15 minutes for them to make your order. If I'm not starving, it can feed me for two meals.   The people at the counter aren't very friendly, but I don't expect any level of customer service from any take out joints in this area. I'll deal with it for the yummy food!"}
{"text":"This is my second time at Taftan and I'm so disappointed.  My first time here was a few months ago when I picked up some take-out and that experience was good enough to bring me back for another go at their menu and boy, they failed miserably.    I dislike inconsistency.  My first visit was fairly hassle-free right from ordering to receiving my order.  Although it took some time to receive my order (it was very busy Saturday afternoon), I got what I ordered.  The kabobs (koobideh, dark meat chicken and barg) were well seasoned, juicy and flavourful.  Although they serve halved tomatoes instead of a whole one you get at most other Persian kabob places, I didn't mind paying extra for more tomatoes.  Overall a very memorable experience.  This visit did not turn out so pleasant.  I stood in line (2 people ahead of me) to order and the lady behind the counter started having some trouble with one of the patron's orders.  She continue to fumble with the cash register as the gent patiently waited for her to get her math right.  I, too, waited patiently to place my order.  Then after waiting some 15 minutes for the counter lady to finally get her act together, she started taking orders from other patrons (they spoke to her in Farsi) that came in after me and didn't bother to stand in line.  When I told her that I was there first and confronted one of the offenders, he and she both shrugged and said, \"I/he wasn't ordering.\"  Of course, some 5 minutes later, he gets his food and walks out.  It was unbelievable.    When I finally placed my order (3 large combos totaling almost $70), I waited another 20 minutes to receive it by the time I got the food, I had to rush out to get home on time for dinner.  When I got home and unpacked our food, she had given me wrong cuts of meat on ALL of the orders and only packed 2 salads.    To add insult to injury, the kabobs (koobideh, chicken breast, lamb chops and steak) were all dry and tough to eat.  I felt so bad for my 19 months old babe who couldn't eat much of anything because it was just too tough for the little one to chew.    Such an upsetting experience to follow up a very pleasant initial visit.  I will not return to Taftan anymore.  I can't be bothered to patronize a restaurant that treats their customers this way, never mind the significant drop in the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I guess this place is popular for take-out.  when we got to Toronto, my cousin went to pick up dinner from here.  I tried the soltani, some of the chicken kabab, and their salad and here's what I think:   - you're a Persian Restaurant, there is NO reason to justify you running out of mast-o-khiar or mast-o-mousir  - the barg part of the soltani was good, but I saw a few pieces on other people's plates that were WAAAAAYYY too pink for me to even think about  - the chicken kabab was pretty good  - rice was dry  - Koobideh was dry, thin, and tasted too gamey for me (like cheap lamb almost)  - no bread? not even some lavash just thrown in under the kabab? r u guys new to this type of work or something?  - Salad dressing for a salad that accompanies a Persian meal should NOT be Italian dressing!  What's wrong with you people? common sense much?  I know there was at least 4 other places in the immediate area, so i'd expect them to step their game up, but I guess they don't agree."}
{"text":"I had Persian kebab before and this is just okay. Taste is not that great and the kebabs had way too much butter??! Portion size is quite fair but they need to fix the quality."}
{"text":"Worst Chenjeh kabob I ever had... not fresh nor tender!! The customer service also sucks. Never go back again."}
{"text":"Excellent food cooked on real coals. yes, seriously you can see in the kitchen the cook is poking the hot embers with a metal device. Its not an electric grill! The lamb dishes are the best IMO. They have huge portions of rice which is beautifully fluffy and fresh. A small person (less than130lbs) could not finish a dish, mainly because of all the rice. from outside across the street you can always smell the bbq coming wafting over the neighbourhood. Some would call it slightly ghetto but I don't mind it at all. Its not dirty, just the seats, tables, and stools resemble one of those old breakfast diners."}
{"text":"Unbeatable traditional Persian kebobs. Just leave room 'cause the servings are big and delicious. This is not really a sit down place though. It is more of a togo place. There is some limited room for sitting and I would recommend you sit and eat the freshly cooked food there."}
{"text":"My boy friend and I love to come to this place for take-out. It never disappoints us: the food is above decent and taste healthy. I love the lamb shank, fasenjun, and ehmeh( I call it the orange stew). The best part is that they give out free tattik soaked with yummy source. They don't always have what you though. Bf always calls before we go to pick the food up. A very non-fancy and tasty choice."}
{"text":"Delicious Iranian food which is kabobs and rice. The options are beef, lamb and chicken and several daily stews. I have never tried the stews but the kabobs are tasty. They are probably 1,000 calories of meat and fat (and then there is the rice), but it is so tasty. Everything is freshly done in front of you and they include salad and tomatoes. Taftan is a take-out place and very rundown, but the food is fast and delicious. If you want to dine at an Iranian restaurant try Shishlix across the road, but I have not been there in a while. They used to be good several years ago. Taftan is not cheap either, but then again it is so tasty and they give you so much food. favourite: Vaziri which is beef and chicken combo on rice."}
{"text":"Two strikes are enough that i will never return to this place. Asked the lady at the register to explain a few options and they were rude. It is not like the questions were complicated.  This place gives Pursian food a bad name. The chicken tasted disgusting, rice lacked any substance. I tossed out the dinner after a couple attempts at eating it. I didn't think even open the salad as i figure if the cooked food is this bad then not taking any chances with raw."}
{"text":"I have known this place existed for a while but never came here for today. We wanted Persian food but something cheap. (\"North\" at Yonge and Steeles are good but expensive.)  This is a take out place but it has seating at the patio area, and inside it has seating along the wall.  All the combo has pictures on the wall, so it was very easy to order.   I had a grilled chicken breast with salad and rice (8.99) My friends ordered Koobideh (made of ground beef and spices) with salad and rice(7.99), and chicken leg kebab with salad and rice (7.99).  The food portion is so generous that I cannot finish the rice at all.  The waitress even gave us Two free side dish because they like us. Hehe.  Overall the food is delicious and very bang for the buck. Definitely my type of restaurant!"}
{"text":"I got food to go from this place. When I got home and opened my food I noticed a hair. I called right away and the lady who answered was very rude, said she was busy and hung up on me.  Worry customer service ever!!  Never going back there again"}
{"text":"Tonight is the third time I've been here for dinner on a weekday night. Quite satisfied the first two times, and this time is no different! The place doesn't have the nicest decor, but I'm here mostly for the food and for two out of three times I've gotten take out, so I don't really mind. The cashier was nice.  I decided to order 2 of combo #25 (lamb chops + koobideh with rice and salad, $15) to go; the food was ready for pick up exactly 10 minutes after ordering. The lettuce/olive/onion/tomato salad was packed separately from the rice + meat, which is a nice touch, and came with vinaigrette on the side. I really enjoyed the flavor of the rice and both meats, but found the 5 lamb chops to be a bit dry for my tastes. The portion size was quite fair; I always feel mighty stuffed after one combo here - especially since they're quite generous with the rice. Would go back again if I'm in the area and craving Persian food!"}
{"text":"Fair prices, extensive and authentic menu, friendly and efficient service, tasty and high quality food. A great take-away option for healthy, delicious and fresh Persian food."}
{"text":"As the name states they specialize in Kebabs. The establishment is small and mostly directed for take out. There are a few stools for people to sit and eat. Overhead they have i think 30 different platters to choose from (some are single dishes and others are combos: beef + lamb etc).   I chose a chicken kebab that came with rice and salad. The amount of rice vs salad and meat felt appropriate. The chicken was yummy but not that great.   If anything I deducted stars coz there was no flexibility. Like they don't make fries or any other side dish that could be used as a substitute to rice. But yes wil come again to try different kebabs."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Located behind a busy plaza, this busy takeout joint smells as delicious as the food tastes.   We tried the koobideh and chicken breast combos which came with rice and salad. I wanted to try the ghemei, which is a split pea stew but they were sold out for the day. The koobideh, which was highly recommended to us, is juicy and flavourful. The chicken breast, while flavourful, was a bit dry. The rice and salad were great and the meal also comes with a roasted tomato which adds some nice brightness to the meal.   The meat is cooked over hot charcoal and this really makes a difference in flavour. For about $10 per person, you get a generous portion of food.  This is definitely not a pretty place, takeout is recommended but you can eat inside. There are bars and stools for dining in.   Service is efficient and friendly enough, nothing outstanding.   Overall I'd definitely come back when I'm craving Iranian food and I'd also love to try some more dishes!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Taftan on Yonge at Churchill to satisfy my craving for Kabob Koobideh and Gormeh Sabzi. Their prices are great and all of the combos include rice and salad. They make the food fresh on a charcoal BBQ so it has that authentic flavour (not that I'd know being a white dude who's family has never set foot near Iran). They seem to appreciate my business and always are friendly despite being one of the few who order in English.   Ask for some \"tadeeg\" (crispy rice from the bottom of the pot) if you want to try an interesting Persian snack with your meal. It's free by request!"}
{"text":"Disappointed ! The chicken kabob was super dry . The koobideh didn't Taste like koobideh at all no seasoning what do ever. Rice was overcooked . Very bad experience .  And the side salad was pity . They should never serve that to any customer ."}
{"text":"I'd driven by so many times and was always intrigued by the \"low-calorie\" sign, LOL.  However, there's nowhere to park here, so I knew I'd have to make a special trip via TTC one day.  I actually came here after getting my hair done at Salon de Elephant - it's just a short walk away.    The service was pretty cold and unfriendly, but I'm generally okay with that if the food makes up for it.  Which it didn't.  I mean, it was alright, and the chicken wasn't too raw, which some people have said can happen, but it was average.  Actually, I think the spices might have been toned down for local palates.  The portions were smaller compared to competitors with similar prices - there was a lot of salad.    I prefer their competitors over them though, because their meat isn't juicy enough.  Kebab is inherently a dry meal - grilled meat and rice with no sauce - so the meat needs to be really juicy and impart flavour to the rice.  At Taftan, the meat is dryer and there's less of it in proportion to rice.  I'd reather go to Tah Deeg up the street!  Tip: They don't seem to indicate that you can choose dark or white meat for chicken kebabs, but you can - just ask!"}
