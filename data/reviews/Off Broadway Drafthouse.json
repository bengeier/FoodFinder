{"text":"Chef Dave plus an amazing atmosphere equals my favorite spot in the 608.  Huge beer list and great fish fry. Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Went there last night: bartender was excellent, food (fish fry) was great, waitstaff was terrific but the check in service sucked!!!! We arrived at 6:00, the attend said 20-25 minutes max!  At 6:40 we asked about a table for 2.....they lost our reservation  what?  It took another 20 minutes to get seated.  Other couples were seated before us that arrived after us!!! When you have a nice place.....get your act together!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Been twice, both times for lunch and we will be back as I HAVE to try something else on the menu. The house burger was so good, We ordered it second visit too.  Perfectly done,juicy,fresh yummy bun and loved the Bacon jam.  Wonderful Old Fashion, WONDERFUL kick to it. Friendly manager,enjoyed chatting with him.  Took off one star only because our second visit waitress took forever to get around to us. Only checked on us when she brought the bill, (perhaps a good thing as I would have ordered another drink, and I was driving.)They were not very crowded at the time. We Will be back, I am talking to you RibEye  and Fish Fry!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service! The chicken diablo was really tasty as were the frites and cocktails. Long cocktail/beer/ menu. Also had gluten free options."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the grand opening. It was great! Wisconsin-centric without being obnoxious. It is refreshing to have a tavern with a good beer list and good, fresh food. Service was wonderful. I can't wait for the patio to open!"}
{"text":"Great beer & cool building remodel. The Sliders are awesome, if served with a pickle they would be perfect. Food is well thought out & high quality. Not greasy, pre-frozen, deep fried junk. Lot's of potential at the Off Broadway Drafthouse.   Update: Recently had the Sunday special spicy buttermilk fried chicken thighs. It blew me away, 5-star meal, huge portion only $12 bucks. Creme Brûlée for dessert was outstanding."}
{"text":"The Off Broadway Drafthouse is a welcome addition to Monona and the general Eastside Madison area. With an awesome beer list and creative menu, I can understand why this place is always packed. And that's the reason for the lackluster review. There is virtually no waiting area which forces people waiting for a table to squeeze into the bar area. Speaking of waiting for a table, the process of getting your name on the waiting list is confusing and chaotic; with people finding any piece of real estate to wait. Because of this the small bar is often elbow-room only. When it's this busy it's tough to get the bartender's attention and with such a large, unique tap list it's almost necessary to ask a few questions and a taste or two before committing to your pint."}
{"text":"Great small restaurant.  The food is very good and different.  My wife says the Friday fish fry is the best she ever had.  I am allergic to fish.  I had their sirloin steak and it was done perfectly.  They have salad, sandwiches, burgers, dinner's and bar snacks.  They have special most nights. They have a large selection of craft beers on tap.  They are busy during normal eating hours so go early.  The food is just great."}
{"text":"Went a couple of weeks ago on a Thursday night right after they'd opened. I was by myself but was still offered a full table, which was appreciated.  I opted, however, for a high stool two-seater near the bar.  My waiter, Skyler, answered my questions about the drinks...and even helped me to figure out an option for a dirty martini that was frugal enough for my liking! I think he may have mixed it himself, too.  His other table service for me was on the slow side...but again, they'd just opened so I realized there were likely wrinkles to iron out.   I ordered a beef sandwich that came with homemade Giardinera, which I was excited about because I love a traditional beef with hot peppers. The recipe for these was not what I expected (more pickled as opposed to spicy), but still very flavorful. The meat on the sandwich was very good...but overall, the sandwich was a bit dry.   One thing I was very surprised about was getting a salad of greens as the offered side, as opposed to a potato option. (Though those are offered for an up-charge...which is a little disconcerting.)   I figured, \"why not...a salad's healthier for me anyway.\"   However, I was BLOWN AWAY by the lemon vinaigrette dressing; I'd been looking forward to my sandwich but ate every bit of my salad first because it was so delicious. Simple, but so yummy.   I agree with other reviewers that the prices a bit high for the portions. But the food is  flavorful...just have to figure out what the best value for what you select, or simply be willing to pay for additional items ala carte.   If I were more of a beer person, I'd be very impressed with the selection.   The interior itself is beautifully decorated...and I was told much of the wood design was re-purposed from the building's previous incarnations.  I also enjoyed the interior's definite nod to the history of the area - a clever touch. It was  interesting to see and helped me know more about what my neighborhood used to be like.   I noticed the WI-fi connections for personal electronic ports at the bar - that's handy for people like my spouse who just can't seem to keep their phone off during a nice dinner (my burden to deal with...but ARGH!)   It will be especially good also when the outside area is built up more for patio use....I could even ride my bike here if I get really industrious as it's near the trails around Lake Monona.  That will be nice! I think there are even bike racks to accommodate that."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and had 3 appetizers, 2 sandwiches, and a side. The appetizers - the warm goat cheese, the frites, and the dry rub wings - were all excellent. The wings in particular were awesome. Similarly, the roasted tomato slaw that I had as a side was surprisingly great. The sandwiches - shaved beef and chicken Diablo - were just sort of there. Not bad but fairly bland. Both would have been well-served with a little more heat - as it is their descriptions are a bit misleading. The service was super friendly - though our appetizer came at the same time as the main and we waited unreasonably long for our bill to picked up - and the atmosphere is really great. The beer list is excellent. I came down on 4 stars instead of 3 because I think most of the issues can probably be attributed to newness and the restaurant is a truly welcome addition to the area."}
{"text":"Great friendly service!  The place is very warm,  if a bit loud... Good Caesar salad  with yummy chicken!   Returned for Friday fish fry.  Great fried cod and frites.  The coleslaw needs more flavor, Dave."}
{"text":"This place isn't really all that special or different than the tons of other Madison area restaurants. We went for fish fry. I ordered the cod with frites. I ended up with potatoes instead of frites because the waitress wrote it wrong. Annoying but whatever. The fish fry was nothing special, the batter didnt have any kind of flavor or seasoning to it. My meal also came with a bun (looked like a cheap bake and serve roll), potatoes, tartar sauce, and coleslaw. Coleslaw had too much dressing and was very sweet, it definitely lacked basic seasoning, the potatoes weren't bad. We ended up getting a side of frites since we all wanted some, those weren't bad.  I guess there really wasn't anything in particular that set this place apart from the rest. Good beer selection, nice patio but nothing special. I will not be back. There are other places that do a fish fry MUCH better than this place. I'm not really sure why folks are ranting and raving over this place."}
{"text":"Terrible service and no redeeming qualities. We came in, were seated, then ignored. Eventually I asked the bartender if we had a server. She called back to the waitstaff and no one knew who was responsible for our table. They sorted it out, I guess, and after a while someone took our order and brought the food, but then never came back. I signaled to her so I could order another beer. We waited fifteen minutes, finished our food and the beer never came. I went back over to the bar to ask, and they said they were \"really slammed.\" But the bar and restaurant were half empty. The burger was unexceptional and the fries were tasteless and limp. The beer list is ok, but super heavy on stouts and not much choice in terms of other styles."}
{"text":"The tomato/bacon jam is delicious on the hamburger.  The atmosphere is casual and the food is great.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night and the place was nearly full. There was just one table open that we were able to sit down at immediately. My fiance and I ordered the mussels (in wine) and the walleye pan-seared. We shared both. The mussel order was huge. With the crostini (I LOVE GOOD BREAD) and all of the mussels, I think we could have been satisfied with just that. They split the entree plate for us. I guess I am weird, I am probably one of the few people who would rather split it myself. Oh well, nothing to fret over. The walleye was cooked to perfection. Overall the food was good, the decor was cute, but it didn't WOW me like some places do. If I had the option I would have given it a 3.5 rating. It's definitely better than a 3 but not quite a 4. I think it was the menu. It was hard for us to find items that we REALLY wanted to try. That being said I would like to back on a less lively night and sit at the bar. We are bar sitting people! :)"}
{"text":"We went to Off Broadway for the first time after hearing good vibes from some locals. The restaurant has a rustic feel, and feels pretty open. There are booths and tables with an extra room off to the side where people can wait when the restaurant is busy. We went on a Saturday night and it wasn't too busy. It seems their prime night is Friday, as they had a special fish fry menu.   We started with two beers from their extensive draft beer menu. They came out right away. For dinner, I ordered the ABG salad and my partner ordered the soup special and the straight up grilled cheese to which he added ham. The salad was the perfect proportion. I'm picky with toppings and dressing, but the waitress got everything right. My partner said the grilled cheese was yummy too, with a hefty amount of ham. We ended the meal with dessert, which is rare for us, but we were still a little hungry. We went with the carrot cake after the manager, who came by to check on us, said it was the best thing on the menu. It would be hard to argue with him as the cake was indeed excellent. While I personally thought the cake was slightly dry, the cheesecake layer in the middle and cream cheese frosting on top made up for it.   We will be back, perhaps to try the Friday fish fry. Otherwise, this place could easily become a frequent stop, just because of the atmosphere, nice staff and consistently good food. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday at 4pm which is when their Fish Fry special starts. The food was delicious, although, in my opinion, a bit overpriced. They do have a huge beer selection which is cool. It wasn't as busy as some of the other comments suggested but it was 4pm on a Friday so I don't know. Server said they have brunch on Sunday from 7am-1pm which is a reason I will be back. Place was super clean but a little on the smaller side. Server was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for awhile, but was a little scared off by initial reviews about service.  A friend and I went last night and had a wonderful experience start to finish.  Very busy, parking was a bit of an issue with big crowd due to \"Founders\" night (brewery event.)  Seated quickly by friendly hostess and promptly attended to by server.  As it was first visit we had lots of menu questions, including the beer promotions, but were never rushed even with a crowd.  Shared a wonderful beet/goat cheese salad and the penne pesto pasta special.  Obviously not overly creative choices, but I appreciate a gastro-pub not trying too hard, keeping the menu simple and focusing on quality ingredients.  Refreshingly not-overdressed salad and not over-pesto'd pasta.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had a special for craft beer week on the cod Friday fish fry.  I never order cod any where, always disappointed. Do better with Vandekamps etc at home. Cod here was AMAZING!!  Fresh, light, perfectly battered. Good thing not an all you can eat!  Sides weren't same caliber. Got the frites (fries are traditional!) but over cooked, limp, tired. Felt like sitting around and re-dumped in fryer to heat up. Noticed everyone else was going with other option, Yukon golds so will try that next time.  Coleslaw boring. But rye bread a welcome surprise. Also had a taste of clam chowder which wet my whistle for more. Plan on returning to try the lake perch and blue gill. Since their cod was so great can't wait to see their spin on my favorites!  Great tap beer selection at good prices. Did charge me for an extra beer that had to be taken off."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch during the week. If I lived nearby, I would probably make this my neighborhood bar. Mostly local ladies from the immediate area were having one Off Broadway's tap beers off the bar extensive beer menu along with their lunch. A nice clean cozy place with a wonderful untypical food menu. Decorating for Halloween with real baby pumpkins was a nice touch."}
{"text":"The beer selection is great, which originally brought me in, plus I live nearby. The food is very good. They are so busy during fish fries, that I cannot find a parking spot, so it must be excellent. I really hope to try it sometime. I especially like the Chicken Diablo Sandwich (think chimichurri), the War Pig Sandwich, and the Raywood Wrap. The frites are terrible, however. I highly doubt that they are cut to order, and more likely prepped and refrigerated ahead of time, resulting in cold sweetening (or it could be enzymatic browning, perhaps), which makes them look and taste burnt--not a deal-breaker, though, so I will be back."}
{"text":"I got lunch. My sandwich was not good. Diablo chicken - not your average spicy chicken sandwich in a bad way.  Sandwiches come with a crappy little salad. Alternatives for a two dollar up charge.  The service was good. Atmosphere was real good. And the tap selection was terrific.  I'm sure I should have sprung for the fish fry. But my first impression of this place was of tremendous disappointment. The only thing they did intentionally wrong is the bun. It was garbage. The rest of the meal just wasn't me. I didn't quite understand what I was getting into from the description on the menu.  So I'm left with a bad first impression and the conclusion that I won't be going back. Good luck to them though."}
{"text":"Very reasonable prices, good food and a wide selection of beers. We sat on the patio and enjoyed ourselves. My chicken sandwich was very good and the desserts were delicious and reasonably priced too. Would definitely go back and want to try the brunch soon too."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and the wait staff were pleasant and knowledgeable of all the craft brews and menu. I do not frequently go out to eat as most food is made from processed boxed/canned foods; I ate the Tres Carnes Sliders (buffalo, lamb, pork) and they were not only tasty but, garnished nicely.  Keep in mind...it's a 'pub', however,  this is quality food with great craft beers to boot. Prices were fair, proportions were perfect and yes...I'll be back!"}
{"text":"UPDATE!  I'm upping this place to 4 stars after trying their fish fry!  I went with my brother & husband (and baby in tow....always).  We each got a different fish: perch, bluegill, and the cod.  The cod was some of the best cod I have ever had!  They cooked it perfect.  Bluegill was a very close second, and I probably won't get the perch again but it really was still good - the breading wasn't as crunchy as the other two, so I would lean towards getting those.  They also now offer 5 ounce pours on all their taps for half of the price on the menu - perfect for me as I cannot have more than 'a drink' right now - it allows me to try more than one beer!  We got there at 5 and were able to get a seat - but after that, it looks like the wait was getting to be very long!  There were a ton of people standing up front when we left around 6 - get there early if you can!"}
{"text":"We had wings and the wedge salad, both were great tasting and large portions. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend for a date night."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection and a surprisingly sophisticated menu highlight a fun new spot in Monona. I recommend the War Pig and the carrot cake!"}
{"text":"Finally! I'm usually upset when they replace a neighborhood bar with a new, possibly hipster place. But Off Broadway got it right. Warm decor, good atmosphere, quick service  and a solid menu. I have yet to have a bad meal. Just had the most amazing bowl of mussels with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc for under $20. War Pig is very tasty and while I'm not a vegetarian, the veggie sandwich is a must order if it's on the menu. Book me a table every week and welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"So, I went back to this establishment, thinking it would have worked out is kinks since the last time I was there over a year ago. But again, I received horrible service. No one smiled, everyone that worked there looks like they're miserable, which in turn rubs off to your customers. It took the bartender about 5 minutes to greet us, and another 5 to even get our drink order in(they were not busy by any means). Food is mediocre at best. But I didn't get asked how it was until I was almost done. Fries were overdone, and was missing the chili lime aioli I ordered with my meal, but by that time, I was pretty much finished. The one star rating is for the service. As someone who has worked in this industry for 13+ years, I enjoy going out to eat where the staff is excited about the menu & likes their job. That is why people go out to eat. For the atmosphere, the service, the experience. If I wanted to eat a chicken sandwich in silence, I would have made food at home. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Went out to dinner with some friends and my wife. Service was good and friendly. Food was fresh and tasty. Only complaint is that parking is limited for the area so it's hard to get in on a busy night."}
{"text":"No gracias. Hard pass. Hmm, perhaps not.  O-V-E-R-R-A-T-E-D  Yup, I said it.  It is a great looking place.  My level of impressive ended there.  Oh you have a ton of beers?  Oh, welcome to Madison, you must have good food too.  I ordered the house burger with greens.  The best thing on that plate was the housemade dressing on the greens.  Other than that, it fell flat.  I felt like the burger had no identity, I could have gotten it at any restaurant in town.  It was a really dissatisfying meal.  Also - please post SOMEWHERE that your menu will be shortened on Friday.  Very few options.  And you ran out of cod on a Friday, by 7?  That is inexcusable in this state.    Our server was elusive.  We saw her very little and getting refills was difficult.    I doubt I will give this place another try.  There was nothing that made me want to go back."}
{"text":"OBD is a very nice reincarnation of the original tavern that served guests here for year.  The interior is a cool, modern-ish take on Wisconsin tavern/supper club that works really well.  Old black & white photos adorn the wood-paneled walls for a unique look that pays homage to the tavern's heritage.  The beer list is excellent, with a lot of interesting local and farther-flung brews, with the tap list displayed on video board above the bar (they're a verified venue on Untappd, so you can also check out their lineup from afar).  Service has been great on all of our visits, with very friendly, attentive servers who know their stuff.  We've enjoyed (in addition to beers, of course) sandwiches, sides, and, most recently, Friday fish fry, and I recommend everything I've tried so far."}
{"text":"Awful and ridiculous. We were there last night and everything but the decor was a disaster. First, they had a limited menu--on a Friday night--that left only a single vegetarian choice, a salad. I've never heard of reducing selections on your busy night. Plus this is a hipster place in MADISON. Vegetarians abound! Absurd. Half our party was left w no options. Next, even though it was only 5:30 they were out of multiple items and beverages on the menu which means their back of the house is just as poorly managed as the front--which brings me to the biggest problem-our server. Yea, when the drinks came after over 20 mins they were wrong and the food bland and mediocre, but that was nothing compared to our rude, rude, rude waitress. Though I would never not tip, it was so tempting. She was both inept and contemptuous. It seemed that it was our fault they were out of everything? After telling us that the second beer my friend ordered was out, she simply walked away and didn't even let him reorder. I can't think of the last time I was treated so poorly as a paying customer.   We were so excited to have a new addition to our neighborhood, but I guess that too was our mistake."}
{"text":"Good stuff! We were seated quickly, even with a group of 6. The beer/whisky list was extensive and on point. The food was fantastic and reasonably priced. We will be definitely be coming back when we are in the area again."}
{"text":"No ranch dressing, nowhere besides jam packed bar while waiting for a table. They don't even have a bench to sit on, you have to just stand there for 20 mins. Good outdoor patio though!"}
{"text":"The good - Patio seating area and service were pretty good.  The place is brand new and it shows.  Nothing worn or broken. Music volume on the patio was perfect - audible but still able to talk to a table of people.  The bad - While others have raved about the lemon vinaigrette I thought it had very little flavor and was just an oily mess. There aren't many other dressing choices either and this was their 'signature' dressing.  It wasn't for me.  We had the wings app and while cooked correctly they had no sauce on them at all.  They were served with a small pile of salad greens dressed with what tasted like the lemon vinaigrette with some BBQ sauce mixed in.  Strange at least, it was just plain weird. Were you supposed to dip the wings in the salad dressing?  Maybe we just didn't get it.  I also expected more draught beer selections.  They had a number of bottled beers but I can get that at Woodman's. Waypoint has many more draught options.  We asked if this place and the Waypoint in Monona had the same owner and they said no. However the menus looked and were presented the same, the menu selections were very close and the décor seemed like a close replica. If it is the same owner they should bring one of the chefs over from Waypoint for a while to jump start the menu or at least make a decent salad dressing.  I will spend my money at the Waypoint over this one at least for now."}
{"text":"I am very impressed with the Off Broadway Drafthouse. I had been in the old bar before it was sold and remodeled, and WOW! This place looks completely different. You can tell each and every detail was thought out. The walls have really interesting prints of Wisconsin history including aerial views of the draft house YEARS ago.   The beer has a rotating tap with some delicious choices. I was lucky enough to try a brand new New Belgium beer released in April that I fell in love with.   The food was just as impressive. We ordered the Tres Carnes Sliders as an appetizer and they were perfect in every way. Very flavorful, I would order them again in a heartbeat. My BF had the Thursday special the grilled pork chop, and his exact word were \"This is the best pork chop I have ever had\". He ate every bite. I ordered the Chicken Diablo and it was also delicious. It came with fries that were fresh cut. Both the chicken and fries were cooked perfectly.   The place was packed, but not overly crowded. It was nice to see a mix of people young and old enjoying food and beer. I'd say this is a great addition to the area. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I had the mussels this morning for brunch with a Chardonnay wine sauce. It was the best!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Been driving by for a few years and meaning to try it out.     Tonight was the night, and oh are we happy.   Great staff...cool atmosphere..and our meal was fantastic.   Started with the warm goat cheese plate...excellent.   I had the fried cod and wife had the Frazier melt..also excellent.    Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"So happy that this new bar/restaurant is here!  Great beer selection and food!  We love the dill brined chicken wings!  We are moving to Monona soon and plan to go here often!!!"}
{"text":"By all means, check this place out. Outa the park fries, great selection of beers and a very pleasant environment,  especially the patio. The War Pig is for pork lovers who are very hungry - I will finish mine tomorrow. Kay enjoyed tge sliders, but one of them rode home with us as well."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant with good food and a very good selection of drafts. Parking isn't that great as my car's front cowling was scraping on the way into the parking lot. Fast service although not efficient as there were several things forgotten and steps retraced."}
{"text":"I brought my wife and family here to dine for Mother's Day after hearing about this new restaurant. Being their first week open you can tell that they're still getting acclimated to everything. That's to be expected though. So, my review is based more on the food than the service. My wife ordered the shaved beef sandwich and side of greens and I had the Tuna steak with the broccolini and frites. My wife and I were surprised when our food came out with the small portion sizes of everything for the price of the entrees. My Tuna steak was flavorful, but very small. The broccolini was a bit too crunchy for my liking and the frites were good, but there wasn't very many of them. My wife said her sandwich was tasty, but also on the small side for the cost. Overall, we probably wouldn't return for the food purely based on the cost for the small portion sizes."}
{"text":"I love the open concept and coziness of Off Broadway. It's smaller than I expected, but in a good way - sometimes restaurants like this are too big and awkward.  We visited for brunch on a snowy Sunday and sat at the bar.  Our server/bartender was very nice and attentive.  I tried the walleye and eggs and my husband tried the biscuits and gravy.  Both were delicious - fresh tasting and perfect portions.  I'd love to come back for a fish fry.  I'm no longer a beer drinker, but their options are plentiful and bartenders knowledgeable about what they have on tap.  I think they're developing more of a cocktail menu as well."}
{"text":"This place is impressive. Chose to sit at the bar for breakfast, service was awesome. The bartender offered up some interesting facts about the remodel and made a terrific bloody. The highlight was definitely the food. We had the house breakfast and Door County cherry waffles. I loved that the breakfast came with greens and literally everything else was perfect. Prices were more than fair."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and only three other people and had to ask for everything. Water, new drinks, and to order food.   Ordered nuts and the diablo chicken sandwich. Took almost 30 minutes to receive the one sandwich and nuts at the same time. Nuts were the appetizer. Do not understand why nuts took almost 30 minutes.   Sandwich was fantastic, but service left everything to be desired. Either understaffed or completely inefficient.   Do NOT go hungry or in a hurry."}
{"text":"Stopped in while my wife shopped. Grabbed a beer and they had a great selection! I'm an IPA guy and they are somewhat hard to find compared to where we used to live, portland. I would come back. 5-6 bucks a pint, cool inside"}
{"text":"A nice place a little bit off the beaten path.  Came in here last Saturday before the Badgers hockey game.  Sat at the bar.  Service was attentive and outstanding.  The women working behind the bar really made me feel at home.  Food was good but I would say the veggie risotto was pretty bland.  We also had ribs, frites, and mussels, no complaints there.   The best part about this place was the beer selection.  It was second to none.  You can do 5oz pours here too if you want to sample from their generous selection.  I would definitely recommend any beer lover in Madison to visit this place at least once.  I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great burgers juicy  with greens/ house dressing. Mussels tasty too. Beer menu changes so if you looked it up on line don't expect the same list-  but choices were good. Prompt service. Nice remodeled Wisconsin decor bar and grill. We will be back."}
{"text":"Walked in and the place felt like you were welcome.  Warm and interesting decor.  Sat down at bar and bartender was friendly and well informed on the great craft beer mix. They have a digital beer menu which helps with selection but bartend encouraged samples.  Did not get food but menu was a surprise.  Not your typical bar food - yea!  Looking forward to stopping for a bite."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday, late morning, during the brunch menu. There were also football food specials. We chose the pork nachos. There was plenty of pork, and the chips were freshly made. The tap list was extensive.  We ate on the shaded patio.   Went with three stars instead of four only because the prices were a little more than I'd expect for the location. Nachos were $13. The food, service, newly redone interior, and menu were great."}
{"text":"First thing first is we wanted to order an app because we were starving- and they don't offer anything under $10 except for nuts. That is just too much for an app. Already disappointed, I ordered the chicken diablo because another reviewer said it was good! It's not. I had to re-look at the menu to see what was even on it. The pesto was so bland and definitely far from spicy. There was supposed to be 2 pieces  of cheese (barely there) and a honey citrus aioli which I believe was forgotten all together. This sand which was SO BLAND all for $9! $2 extra for the famous frites (which are good). This place is over priced and VERY BLAND. Add some flavor!"}
{"text":"We came in on an early Sunday evening. Large choice of draft and bottled beer and also some wines. Hub got the veggie risotto and I did a half grilled ham and cheese and a cup of soup. Also frites. All good and super fast! Lovely patio."}
{"text":"Very bizarre menu! Not sure what they are targeting. Beer prices on the high side for this area as well as the food. Interior is nice but no high top tables for parties of more than 2."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food, large and unique drink selection, excellent environment, and extremely fair prices for how good everything is. Go there, you will thank me later. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Thumbs up for tasty high quality food, good service and atmosphere. I hear the fish fry is amazing but also hear the wait time on Friday evenings can be long. Thumbs down for beer prices!"}
{"text":"I've been to Off Broadway twice and have had two positive experiences. They have a great beer selection. I had a few beers I had never tried before.   The staff is very friendly. I enjoy chatting with them while I'm at the bar. I haven't eaten here yet, but the food I saw looked and smelt delicious! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is a 3, service 1. My wife reports having had an excellent weekday lunch experience a few months back. We were seated by the bartender and sat and waited for between 7 and 10 minutes before she came back. She started with an apology-saying how they were busy.   1 You are a bar in Wisconsin during football season on a Sunday. Do you schedule or plan to be be dead at this time?  2 You were not busy. The nice part about having vision is I can see the same thing as the person next to me. All but one table was taken and all but one seat at the bar was taken. But no one was standing, nor waiting.  If this is busy please see #1.   Not knowing if or when we'll see our server again we order appetizers, entrees and drinks at the same time. Subsequently not one but two other servers come over to ask if they could take our order including one who asked if we wanted to order drinks immediately after (less than a minute) we had received full glasses of beers and sodas. After finishing a beer it sat empty for 8 minutes before anyone asked if I wanted something. Meanwhile male server at table next to us is making small talk. Then appetizers and entrees come at the same time after we had to ask if our order was lost. During the meal my wife's drink order was forgotten-we weren't charged for this one but I'd rather pay for a drink and get it promptly than wait for something free. Service recovery is not the same as good service.   The food was fine. Wings were good after you dumped Texas Pete hot sauce on them-otherwise small and without much flavor. The side salad to this was good. Sliders are nothing special. Lots of potential and unafraid to try new flavor combinations. The food has promise even if the service does not. I have a hard time seeing myself coming back."}
{"text":"I went with a couple of friends last evening for dinner and a drink. The restaurant and bar were aesthetically pleasing. We chose to sit outside on the patio which was small but pleasant. The view wasn't great but they had beautiful flower baskets to distract.  I ordered the ABG salad, $10 no meat as well as my friend. We were extremely disappointed in the size for that price. The salad is basically lettuce with a small amount of goat cheese, beets and other minute amounts. If you're going to serve a salad , it should be loaded with those toppings as well as way more lettuce. Lettuce is cheap.  Another friend ordered the chicken sandwich which was a very thin piece of chicken on a small ciabatta roll with some mixed greens. Not enough protein for my male friend.  The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable.  However, we were so turned off by the size and the price we will not be returning.  We headed to another restaurant and shared some nachos after leaving."}
{"text":"My boyfriend  and I were highly impressed with Off Broadway. Delicious mussels, wings and steak. We also tried the tiramisu And it was amazing!! The restaurant is cute and very clean. Looking forward to going back!!"}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us had dinner here on a Friday night. Although it looked crowded, and we parked on the street aways away, we were seated right away. We then waited 15 minutes for our waitress to arrive. I am not sure if she was the only server that night or what, but we were just starting to think we didn't have a waitress! She brought water and took our drink orders. One person in our group got the wrong beer but did not realize it until she took a sip. She ordered a cider and received a sour? Four of us ordered fish - 2 cod, 2 perch and the other two ordered a burger and a steak. My perch was good, you get a large helping, comes with choice of fries or Yukon Gold potatoes, cole slaw and a piece of cornbread. Next time will order the Yukon Gold, since the fries weren't great. They are skins on and seemed overcooked to us. Burger and steak couple said their dinners were good. There is a funny item on the menu - \"Buy the Kitchen a Drink $15\". Although we did not purchase drinks for the kitchen, we wondered how many people do. Wouldn't be opposed to going back to try a burger, but hope service is a little quicker next time."}
{"text":"We go here all the time. The food is great, the service is good, the drinks are yummy!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Menu is limited but very very good.  Will definitely come back for the food! Service is excellent! Props up for the decor and layout, everyone needs to experience this place."}
{"text":"Loud, no entertainment like a dart board, pool table, etc. When we arrived we sat at the bar.  There was maybe 6-8 other people in the entire place, and it took 10 minutes to get a bartender for cocktails. There was two bartenders but one was too busy counting the till at 8:30 pm to wait on us. Based on the crappy cocktail and wait time we didn't order food.  Seems to me Madison has enough loud, beer bars. I really do not understand it. On a funny side note, we went to an even crappier bar next door (antlers) and we were far more entertained.  Better cocktails, better music, pool tables and dart boards etc...."}
