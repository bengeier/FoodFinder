{"text":"creekside chinese restaurant in airdrie. 
we just came from their dinner buffet. it was , bar none, the worst chinese food we have ever had in our lives. it was actually the worst food period. it tasted like it had been left there from early morning.
the batters were thick and very hard. the sparse pieces of  ginger beef were swimming in sauce and was inedible as was the salt and pepper squid, lemon chicken sui gai . Their only saving grace were the seemingly fresh pieces of charbroiled pork. 
We arrived  just after their evening buffet started. it was nearly empty and it was obvious why. The meat tasted old. 
Never again and will be thankful if we do not get sick on the miniscule amount of food we ate at $14.69 including tax."}
{"text":"We have ordered take out from Creekside twice and both times have raved that hands down it's the freshest chinese food we've ever had. Perfectly seasoned/sauced. Definitely would not go elsewhere ever again! The buffet isn't the greatest, it's a little dried out, but that's pretty typical of chinese buffets I think. Take out is the way to go with these guys!"}
{"text":"I noticed this place after working out one evening and decided to give it a shot.
True to my nature the buffet grabbed my attention and at first glace looked great, with lots of variety.  it was about 7pm so i figured everything was fresh. It wasnt, everything was dry and hard. with a hard skim over the soups and all the sauces dried up on the ginger beef and sweet and sour pork.  I really struggled to eat this and it was very disapointing.  This was offset by very friendly and attentive service.  Im assuming the owners were doing the serving and were very friendly and welcoming.  Id come back in an instant if they got the food issues fixed!"}
{"text":"It was ok.  Nothing special.   The food was not very flavorful and not very authentic Chinese."}
