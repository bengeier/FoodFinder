{"text":"Used to be this crazy wings bar but recently changed to a korean bbq and bar style pub/restaurant. Interior definitely got better and love the new high tech bbq table setting. Easy to use for first time kbbq users and the most important thing, food, were amazing. I guess it can be little expensive compared to other kbbq places but the taste did not disappoint me and my friends.
I would recommend to those who wanna enjoy a late nite bbq with beer. All servers were very polite and the menu was not hard to look and understand. Beer/food came out very fast and the low dim light and the wooden interior really created another new experience of korean bbq. 
If you want huge portion of meat like ayce style this may not be the best place but if yall lookin for nice modern bar interior + korean bbq this is the place to go. Easy to find and great service provided by all servers"}
{"text":"One of the best patios around Yonge and Finch. I know it's a rebranded Korean BBQ spot, but do try their other dishes. We ordered the cold noodle bowl which hits the spot on those hot summer days. My mouth was crying of appreciation of their perfect balance of chewy noodles and crispy tangy kimchi. Beer + Korean food + outdoor patio? I'M THERE."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ with really good quality meats and lots of unlimited sides. Such a cozy atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"The disrespect, the server asked if she can take our lettuce while we were still eating meaning she wanted us to leave asap, what is that?"}
{"text":"It was ok.. not bad, not great. Price vs quality vs quantity was off. I probably wouldn't come back on my own accord but if friends had an event here I wouldn't say no."}
{"text":"J'ai été agréablement surprise, je n'avais pas d'attente. Le service est super amical et souriant, le dolsot bibimbap était délicieux et contenait encore plus de légumes et de bulgogi qu'ailleurs! Mon ami a pris une soupe piquante dont le nom m'échappe, beaucoup trop épicée pour moi mais le bouillon était somptueusement goûteux. Mon ami l'a a-do-ré. Ce petit restaurant mérite d'être davantage fréquenté, j'y retourne dès que l'occasion se présentera!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant with my cousins last night and it is surprisingly good. Their seafood pancakes are falvourful and crispy. The bibimbap is huge and healthy since it comes with a lot of vegetables. I especially like their  beef patty with galbi sauce. 

Also, they have different flavors of soju (popular Korea alcohol). For those who aren't big in alcohol, you can try grape soju, it tastes almost like juice. 

Portions are pretty generous considering their price. 


Service is quick and staffs are friendly. Recommended."}
{"text":"This place is probably one of the better Korean bbqs in Toronto. The food was really good and the atmosphere and decor was really nice. We went on a cold day and it felt like we were dining in a cute cabin. We went during the middle of the day so the place was empty. I'm giving this place 3 stars because I didn't feel the customer service was great. We were seated in the far end of the restaurant and I got out of my seat 3 times during my meal to get assistance because the waiter just didn't come to our table enough. The first time I got up was because there was a hair in my food. He switched it out but didn't seem to care too much. The second time was to ask for a side dish that never came and the third time was to pay for the bill. Then when I paid for the bill the waiter and the other guy at cash started speaking in Korean in front of me after looking at the receipt. Perhaps they expected a higher tip? I shouldn't have tipped at all to be frank but I did so because we liked the food."}
{"text":"This place is cozy and nice. The Bbq is great. Side dishes are not so good except the cheese corn. I expect that they will put that dish on the menu so we can order more cuz I like it. Even when I asked to get some and they can charge me for it but they said no."}
{"text":"Good food. Excellent service. Very patient waiter who gave detailed and interesting descriptions of Korean culture, food, their offerings and cooking tips. Great experience."}
{"text":"Good food, good service...for the first half, after our second order of our half off pork, suddenly all the rules mentioned to us changed to fit them. We order our first round of food with the drinks and were told that the drinks would cover us for another round of meat since we got the pitcher of beer. When we go for round two, were forced to get more drinks for us to order more. Not happy with service at all. Good food though. Overall still a pretty subpar experience. Should rename it Sscam though..."}
{"text":"Spent a few hours here and had a great experience. You might not get as much food as an all you can eat place, but the taste of the food here is really great. The cheese corn here was the best I've ever  had, and the bbq sauce is really well done too. I came here with 1 other person and ordered 2 meats, which come with a variety of preset side dishes."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great food, great service. One of the best kbbq I've had in Toronto! A bit on the expensive side but worth it."}
{"text":"Great Korean bbq with fresh meat and selection of other Korean food. They'll have something for everyone. Service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Very disappointed after reading such good reviews!...the food is overpriced and not authentic, all the side dishes are loaded with sugar, even the kimchi fried rice had sugar and corn in it!...the meat was ok, but not worth the premium prices and we had to cut it up ourselves with scissors...also the vegetable skewer never arrived...
Now add that the entire staff looked miserable, gave us a very uncomfortable table even though we had a reservation and forgot that it was my girlfriends birthday."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day with my bf and we were thoroughly impressed! We made a reservation and was seated promptly. We ordered the pork belly and beef rib eye and really enjoyed both. We also got the kimchi cold noodle soup and wings. Everything was amazing and came really fast. The servers were nice and came to check on us. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday evening at around 7:30pm with 2 friends. This was their first week having half off pork belly (with a purchase of any drink) and so was fairly busy. We waited about 15 minutes before getting a seat. Located right at Yonge & Finch, it is conveniently located near some bars and dessert places you can go to if you feel like something sweet after. There is street parking and a parking lot right near the building. Weekends you can park for free if you don't mind walking ~10 min at Finch Go parking. 

Food *****
We came here for table cooking so we ordered the pork belly (3 portions) of it, with 2 sides of rice, and 1 order of rib eye. Although the price is higher than other Korean BBQ places, the quality is worth the fee and it includes a lot of side dishes and other trinkets: 6 delicious side dishes (better quality than other typical Korean restaurants), 4 different sauces to dip your meat in, mushrooms/onions to cook, corn cheese that melts, and lettuce to wrap your meat in. The meat was delicious and all the side dishes made eating enjoyable as you get to taste different things in combination with the meat.

Service *****
Servers were always attentive and even when they forgot something like refilling water when we asked, they were quick to apologize. My friend asked for certain side dishes for a refill and they always did it with a smile. Even when it was super busy, you can see they tried their best to give the best service possible. 

Ambiance ****
The patio is pretty awesome, although you can't do table cooking BBQ if you decide to eat there. Inside, it gets a bit hot and you'll probably smell a bit like BBQ after, but it a has a rustic but clean wooden setting inside. Outside, they have a mini smoker's pit and being right at Yonge & Finch, has a lot of people walking around to people watch if you're eating outside or taking a smoke break. 

Tips/Closing comments
- They have half off pork belly Tuesdays. However, you MUST order a a drink PER order. So if you want to order 3 orders of pork belly, you must order 3 drinks.
- To order BBQ and do table cooking, you must order at least 2 orders of meat (ie. 1 pork belly and 1 ribeye)
- Don't think this is a good place to eat alone for KBBQ unless you eat a lot, this is best for going with a friend or 2 or 3"}
{"text":"Ssam is one of the best Korean barbecue places that I have visited in a while. Walking in, I expected a lot from the great reviews I've read from yelp and from recommendations from friends. And I can say that Ssam really did live up to those good comments.

Although it was a little cramped and really busy, the servers were really efficient and accommodating at the same time. Expecting at least a 40 minute wait when we got there at around 7:30pm (since it was the half off pork belly/shoulder Tuesday special,) we were sat down within 20 minutes. In all honesty, Ssam gives off a really comfy vibe; I would not have minded another 20 minute wait.

For the main course, we ordered pork belly, pork shoulder butt, beef rib eye, and beef hanging tender as well as the seafood pancake. Though this may be up to preference, I was much more satisfied by the pork than the beef. Honestly, I couldn't get enough of the pork, I'm still craving it now. On a serious note, their food is likely that of the better quality KBBQs that I've tasted but maybe not something I would pay for if not for special prices.

Before serving us our food, we were served the routine side dishes (kimchi, braised potatoes, spinach, etc.) as well as three (!!) complimentary dishes which we were quite surprised by since they were served in regular medium portions (cheesy corn, kimchi soup, and steamed egg.) I would even say that the complimentary dishes really made this meal worth every penny.

With their daily specials, Ssam is rather affordable for a casual night out with friends. I will definitely be returning for more!"}
{"text":"I decided to come here for dinner with my partner. The majority of the customers here seem to have ordered Korean BBQ while we decided to try the tapas menu instead. 
We ordered hot wings with fries and bulgogi kimchi poutine. The wings were on the smaller side and honestly, I can probably make better ones at home... The poutine on the other hand, was really good! I liked that the fries and gravy were piping hot and melted the cheese curds but the bulgogi on the other hand was cold, which was a bit odd. The kimchi pairs really nicely with the fries so no complaints there. The poutine would've been better if the bulgogi was hot like the rest of the dish and if there was more meat. 
The next time I come back I would like to try the BBQ and will most likely order the poutine again."}
{"text":"(Food:) 
Highly recommended food here.  We came here with a group of 4 people and were able to split the MONDAY SPECIAL that included 4 different types of pork and beef meat.  This was my cheat meat day so I went all out.  The meat was served to us raw and it was such fun to cook it ourselves.  It even came with lettuce wraps that we could wrap the meat in! (The server even gave us extras!)  I would recommend grilling some of the ONIONS that come with the dish! Very delicious and cleanses the palate after all the meat.

The SIDE DISHES that they gave us were plentiful and various.  I especially like the CHEESE CORN and the MARINATED ONIONS.

The KIMCHI BULGOGI POUTINE was absolutely delicious and was what I was craving for.  It is basically a poutine layered with bulgogi and kimchi (shocker).  

FLAVOURED GREEN GRAPE SOJU was soo good.  It was quite sweet, but did not overpower you.  It tasted like that green grape candy you get at T&T as a kid.


(Price:)  
MONDAY SPECIAL: $59.99 for 4 types of meat.  [Pork Belly, Pork Shoulder Butt, Beef Short Plate, Beef Rib Eye]
KIMCHI BULGOGI POUTINE: $11.99
FLAVOURED SOJU: $16.99

(Ambience:) I LOVE the ambience here.  It's very rustic and we got a table in the back, so it was quite quiet and secluded.

(Comparable:)  Chako or other korean bbq places are similar, but those are AYCE and have a lot of meat.  This place is definitely satisfying and filling, and is much cheaper.  The ambience is much nicer and you get to try a lot of different kinds of dishes (side dishes and tapas) instead of just meat.  Very different from other kbbq places.

(Overall:) I don't give 5 stars that often, but I loved it! Price was reasonable and the food was delicious.  Service was also good!"}
{"text":"It appears I've been slightly misled. I've seen the 1/2 price pork belly Tuesdays sign as I've driven past. I've read the reviews on Yelp. From Yelp, I found out that you have to buy a drink in order to get 1/2 price. However, I did not find out that it's only after 5pm that this deal is going on. These conditions all also apply to their pork shoulder. I came in at 1:45pm today. We thought we were going to get the deal. We did not. Sad times. It's $16.99 for 1 order of pork belly, if I recall correctly, and you have to do a minimum of two orders. 

We split 2 orders between 3 people. The two orders came to 5 thick strips of pork served on a wooden board with two mushrooms and two full slices of onion. I'm not sure how 5 splits into two orders, but okay then. The pork BBQ came with side dishes, but didn't come with rice. That's an extra $2. Sides were quite pleasant though. We had a small skillet of cheese corn, a stone bowl of steamed egg, a stone bowl not quite full of soybean stew, kimchi, pickled radish, soy sauce potatoes, tofu with soy sauce, seaweed with hot sauce, and pickled cucumbers. I hope I'm not forgetting any. As dipping sauces, we were each given a trio of dips (hot sauce, roasted bean powder, salted sesame oil), and some sort of marinated raw onion and chive concoction. We were also given a small basket of lettuce leaves, seasoned soybean paste, and raw garlic slices. For a place called Ssam, I was expecting more from their veggie wraps. 

The food's pretty good, but at $40 and a bit before tip, I'm not impressed. Perhaps it was a lunch thing, but there was only one server and he had to do everything. Our water cups weren't full much of the time. Still, if I get the same amount of food at the same quality for half that price after 5pm on Tuesdays, I'm coming back then."}
{"text":"Came here for one of my birthday celebrations and heard lots of great things coming into this restaurant from BlogTO and other reviews. Thankfully we made reservations as it was quite busy for a Monday evening and there isn't a whole lot of seating here. It's probably better to make reservations as this place does get busy and having limited seating space.

Every day they have daily specials on the meat after 5PM and $3 shots all day on the weekends. We got the meat special which featured the pork belly, pork shoulder butt, beef short plate and beef rib eye. 
In addition, we ordered the pomegranate soju along with a few appetizers including the seafood pancake and the cheese soft egg roll. All of the food came out rather quickly which was great. The meal came with so many different side dishes- I was definitely impressed by the amount of food they give with your meal. My favorite meat dish was definitely the beef rib eye- simply delicious. The soft cheese egg roll was just oozing with goodness- a nice dish to order and definitely a must get when you are here. We all thoroughly enjoyed the soju. I haven't tried the pomegranate flavour but it was quite good! 

Service was fantastic and very smooth. The servers kept checking on our table to making sure everything was going well. It was definitely a memorable birthday here for sure. Overall, a fantastic birthday dinner here and will definitely be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Pork belly and shoulder is of good quality. Side dishes are amazing (love the corn topped with cheese on a sizzling plate). Price is also very competitive."}
{"text":"The food here is good but the portion is small. It is also not that cheap. A good place to come if you want to hang out, drink and eat something with friends but not a place I would recommend if you want to gorge on meat."}
{"text":"My friends and I ordered 1 serving each of pork jowl & beef rib eye, along w/ a seafood pancake. It came with a bunch of sides, including a skillet of cheese corn, a bowl of steamed egg, soybean stew, glazed potatoes, kimchi, pickled cucumbers, various sauces etc. Everything was fresh & in abundance. And I particularly love mix-matching the different banchans w/ the meat to create different flavors in a lettuce wrap. The seafood pancake was great as well since it wasn't too greasy & had a lot of ingredients. 

As for the service, it was phenomenal. The servers were always attentive and refilled our banchans, lettuce, and water without being asked. They were also very friendly, and followed up w/ us on how things were going. I give them two thumbs up. 

Given the high quality food & great service, I'll definitely be back for kbbq."}
{"text":"The best part of this restaurant is the location. It is at the corner of Yonge and Finch. It is often busy being at the corner of a major intersection with dessert shops and kareoke spots nearby. 

Service: The service here is probably one of the worst service I've experienced at any Korean BBQ restaurants in this area. The guy who served us had absolutely no smile the entire time when my group asked questions. He definitely was having a bad day. He answered everything quickly and he seemed impatient. We felt rushed to order. The server never checked up on our group. Our table was filled with dirty plates causing a lot of space. We were hoping somebody would come and clean some stuff up. 

Food: Food was decent. Not great, just okay. I do like the fact they give a wide variety of banchans (side dishes) compared to other BBQ restaurants. My group ordered a variety of meats including pork belly and beef. The BBQ items were typical and just like your average meats from a Kor BBQ restaurant. 

In order for me to really like a korean BBQ restaurant is when they have something that stands out. Unfortunately Ssam is pretty typical. Given the fact the service was horrible, this discouraged me from coming back when there are numerous korean BBQ restaurants in this area."}
{"text":"Very flesh meat. Beef is marbled and tastes like wagyu. Sauce is very light. Good environment."}
{"text":"Let's start off with, I'm not a big meat eater so I usually don't come to these Korean BBQ places however I was recommended by a friend. I made reservations for two on a Wednesday night just to make sure that we got seats. Upon entering I was greeted right away and bought to a table. 

They offer daily specials for a very reasonable price point. We ordered the Wednesday special which consist of pork belly, pork false lean, beef short place and a choice of either soju or a pitcher of beer (we opted for the green grape soju).
The food came quite quickly with a wide variety of banchans (Korean side dishes). All for 59.99 leaving us really full and satisfied. 

The service we got was good, they checked up on us and refilled our waters just as we were having our last sip. 

Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Pork and beef are fresh and tasty! Complementary plates including cheese corn, tofu soup and steamed egg. Fried chicken wings are juicy. Fires are crispy. Overall, everything tastes good! Would like to go again and try their cocktails!"}
{"text":"Classic late night Korean snacking and soju-drinking (what else would you want at Finch & Yonge? ).

Its a la carte kbbq style with unlimited side dishes. Great quality dishes, sauces and meat, not to mention service too.

Came here on a Saturday night around 9pm for 10 people and was immediately seated even though all our people were not here yet. It was not something I expected, so I really think we got lucky as the place started to fill up.

Fried Chicken - Unfortunately, this was the one item that I would not recommend. I was expecting something along fried chicken at the Fry, but this was some sad few pieces of nuggets that I could of gotten at McDonald's.

Kimchi Poutine - Looks and tastes amazing. It's hearty and hits the right stop, especially for the winter that's going to hit us soon.

Ribeye/pork belly/beef/etc - We got a few meats, all of which were great quality and came with a giant half onion. The side dishes alone was worth it to get the meat.

The flavoured sojus is a must try & the blueberry corona drink. They have daily specials except for weekends so keep an eye out for that. 

We racked up the bill to over $500 and can confidently say we stumbled out of Ssam now broke, but satisfied."}
{"text":"Their daily specials are awesome and inexpensive. The service is exceptional; they always ask us if we want more banchan and often would bring refills without being asked! The food is great, each order comes with so many banchan and sidedishes. I didn't order drinks but their drink menu looks great. Will come again! 

My clothes didn't smell too much like kbbq after I left."}
{"text":"Before Ssam opened, it was called Crazy Wings, which was probably one of my favourite restaurants ever. I was very impressed with the new menu, however, the selection of sauces for the wings became very limited, especially compared to before. I decided to order a pound of honey garlic wings with fries on the side. Honestly, the wings were fantastic! The wings were coated with the right amount of sauce and were fairly big. They were also super crispy. The fries, however, were a bit soggy and had a very strange taste to it, which I didn't much enjoy. My friend ordered the kimchi bulgogi poutine which looked delicious, but he claimed it didn't taste very good. The waiter provided excellent service as well. If you happen to be craving chicken wings or happen to be around the area, you must eat at Ssam! The design of the place is mostly wood with a nice, modern touch. It's normally not packed, which is great so you don't have to wait too long for a seat on an empty stomach. I would definitely come back here again in the future for more wings and possibly to try out other foods on the menu!"}
{"text":"Contrary to other reviews, I thought that the price was fair, knowing that you have several banchans and other extras along with your order of meat. Some people complained about the portion size of the meat, but I like to have diversity when having Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"My current go to Korean BBQ place in Toronto! Go on Sundays for pork belly, pork shoulder butt and rib eye. Avoid peak hours and late night on weekends if you don't want to wait for a table. 

Service could be more friendly and attentive, but the food and side dishes are really great! 

PSA: Don't wear white and expect to leave smelling like meat for the next 2 days"}
{"text":"I was invited to meet some friends for Korean BBQ dinner but I couldn't find the place because their address was incorrect on Yelp. It's since been corrected. No problem. No points lost. Yes, I use Yelp for everything!

First impressions: dark but intimate lighting; nice ambiance; a bit loud; smells yummy. Should be a good night.

My friends had already arrived and ordered and the food had just started arriving when I sat down. Six of us in a booth with one (electric) grill was a bit cramped. There was a good variety of complimentary side dishes and all the food looked like very good quality, especially the meats. Let's cook!

Although I would have preferred a flame (or charcoal) grill, the electric one did a decent job, albeit a little slower and with a lot less char. The quality of the food was very good, especially the meats. The pork belly was my favourite. Good flavours.

Overall, the experience was okay. The service was good. Food was very good, quality and taste. Space was a bit cramped. That yummy smell? My clothes smelled like smoke and had to be washed as soon as I got home. They could use better ventilation."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food experience here! Already can't wait for my next visit. Enjoyed their Tuesday special (half priced pork belly or pork shoulder with any order of drinks). A minimum order of two servings is required so my friends and I opted for one serving of pork belly and one of shoulder in addition to a pitcher of white sangria.

I'd describe the inside of the restaurant as conventional Korean meets 2012 hipster culture with their wood chairs and tables and then exposed brick walls and dangling industrial light bulbs. 

There were so, so, so many complimentary dishes brought out and really polite service; made me feel real pampered. Like the Queen. Like Beyonce. Then came the glorious (soon-to-be) grilled goodness. First of all, how dare they? I will be dreaming about that pork belly more than Kanye dreams about Kanye. And that sangria? Transportive. Brought me to the Bahamas and only cost me $8, thank you. Grilling was very easy (cause I didn't do it, thanks Ann) and there was surprisingly no smoke. I think it had something to do with their fancy grill. Be wary though because you, your clothes, and your children's children will smell of that sweet grease. Or, if you need a little late night sniff snack before bed then embrace the grill. After devouring our meats, we ordered the kimchi bulgogi nachos because we didn't want the fun to end. Unfortunately, the nachos were... less than divine, especially after that meat feast. But, I won't hold it against them. After all, they're a BBQ joint, and if someone hands you a million dollars then steps on your toe can you really be mad at them?"}
{"text":"This is a great place to hangout with friends on a Friday/Saturday night as it serves good food at a good price. 
I have frequented this place over the last few years and it has undergone a lot of changes.
They had renovated over the last year or two and installed a grill for Korean BBQ.
The cuts of meat are fresh and of good quality. It comes with the typical side dishes in addition to lettuce wraps, veggies, steamed egg and cheese/corn in a bowl.
They have a pretty good selection of food aside from the food for kbbq. They do have typical bar food ex. poutine and are served with a twist of Korean flavours. 
This place also serves a wide array of alcohol as well and is a great place if you are looking for a casual/laidback hangout.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We dined in on a snowy weeknight purely out of curiosity for state of the K-BBQ joints in North York.  Originally wanted to try Kookminhakyo or Daldongnae but their seating just did not look comfy enough to brave a dinner with a toddler.  So we decided based on the interior photo that Ssam would be our spot for the night.  

Well, the restaurant is cozy but as soon as you walk into the restaurant, you notice the very sticky and slippery floor which I'm guessing is from all the airborne fat from table top grilling.  They should do a better job at cleaning the floors so it's not so slippery and gross.  Or consider paying for floor mats that can be professionally cleaned to minimize danger to your patrons.  

We ordered a Monday night special which included many different cuts of pork (belly & shoulder) and beef (samgyup & rib eye).  My little girl's favorite was the thinly shaved beef samgyup that cooked up really fast on the grill and stayed nice and juicy from high fat content.  We enjoyed the pork belly, pork shoulder and the rib eye...in that order.  You can't go wrong with pork belly and I like that their cut is nice and thick.  Pork should was ok but a little bit of aging would make it more tender for the grill.  The worst of the lot was the beef rib eye which I highly doubted was actually a rib-eye cut.  It chewed more like a tough sirloin steak and was not a pleasant addition to the combo.  

The rest of the meal was pretty ho hum as their banchans and sauces were way too sweet.  Their kimchi was soooo bad and left a ton to be desired but since there were lettuce wraps, I was ok without digging into possibly the worst kimchi I've eaten in recent years.  

I like that they provide individual wrap condiments and sauces (should really have an explanation in the menu of what these are since no non-korean person would ever be able to figure out the toasted soybean powder to dip your meat into.) but even the sauces were too sweet.  

A small stone bowl of Korean miso stew accompanies the special and was a-ok.  You need to order rice separately ($2).

Our overall experience was ok.  I wouldn't say Ssam really satisfied my craving for a really great K-BBQ and the search for the best K-BBQ in North York still continues."}
{"text":"Came in on a Thursday night with high hopes for this place given the amazing reviews but was thoroughly unimpressed. First of all, the whole you need to order 2 orders for table cooking is just so stupid given that it meant we were tied down to having to order 2 things and not be able to eat the other tapas, etc, As such, so we opted out of this table cooking idea. However, after ordering the kimchi cold noodles and Spicy chicken with cheese, we were told by our waitress that there was no chicken. How does this even happen? Anyways, at this point we had already eaten half our noodles but were told by the waitress we needed to switch our order. She proceeded to suggest tofu? How does that even make sense.... We wanted to see if the restaurant could make an exception given the lack of chicken by letting us order an order of table cooking meat but she shot us down right away. Honestly, if she had even tried to ask a manager or something, it would've been better customer service. The fact that she continually tried to make us order something else and we had essentially turned down most the suggestions given we were not interested was unprofessional. We ended up leaving shortly after as we weren't too happy with the customer service. We also ordered cocktails which are overpriced. Unfortunately, don't think I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"That Korean BBQ is growing in popularity in Toronto is fantastic - and places like this are now more common around the city are equally awesome. 

Most important quality in any Korean BBQ joint is the quality of its meat - and Ssam delivers: particularly for its pork dishes. 

Beef here is good, but not great. I find places like Daldongnae have the thicker and better cuts here, but Ssam is also quite good. 

Seriously, the best part about Ssam are the condiments - particularly the powdered dried beans. I freaking love powdered dry beans, especially with injeolmi (my favourite style of Korean rice cake), but have never seen it at a Korean BBQ place. 

On its own it's too dry - but combined with a few choice toppings, it is absolutely fantastic. I covered the shit out of my meats with it, then topped it with something salty and pickled (often in a lettuce wrap). Fucking delicious.

It's small, but Toronto needs more of that - Korean restaurants that are inventive, rather than a copycat of something in Korea, New York, or LA. Toronto has its own unique flavours, stemming from its multiculturalism. 

Now - this small touch could be a copy, and it is a far cry from any sort of fusion. But creativity is what makes the best restaurants what they are, and this could be a small step towards that."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to have pork belly (samgyeopsal)! I came here regularly when it was a fried chicken joint (Crazy Wings) and it became a Korean BBQ place but most of the staff and management are the same.

The staff and management are sweet and attentive. We were a group of 7 and 4 of us had the table bbq. It was AMAZING! Maybe because I love meat? Anyways, all Korean restaurants give you side dishes called banchan and they're 99.9% of the time free and refillable. Yay!

Our waitress was sweet, the meat and vegetables was fresh and the side dishes were delicious. I have nothing to complain about this place but it does get a bit busy, especially in Fridays and Saturdays.

The only thing I want to mention is that in order to do the table BBQ you need to order two dishes of meat and it can be kind of pricy. If you're worried about the price then you should bring a couple of friends to make it cheaper for you. Also, there's plenty of side dishes and other foods available there (like kimchi bulgogi poutine) that you can get."}
{"text":"I would have given this place a 2.5 if I could, but I'll be nice. Food was okay, service could be A LOT better. We got pork belly, beef, kimchi fried rice, noodles, and they gave a lot of side dishes. The restaurant was quite empty, but our waiter was a hot mess. He didn't give us any utensils until all our food arrived and forgot to bring us lettuce. He often ran off after our requests for water or napkins and never came back. Service aside, the food was pretty good. I personally liked the side dishes more than the meat. I've been to better Korean bbq places, so I wouldn't come again."}
{"text":"The food selection here is amazing, with their newly updated menu and table BBQ; their pricing is very reasonable. The staff was very friendly and patient in explaining their menus, speedy service

They offer many types of drinks including grapefruit soju. The environment is excellent for catching up either with one friend or a group of friends. 10/10 would come back and recommend.

:) this place makes my day, every single time."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening without reservations (for 8 people) and they were able to accommodate us. It started filling up really quick so we were glad to find a table and not have to wait. However, the tables we were seated at were really small and we had a hard time organizing the dishes just so we could fit the rest of our orders. There's also not much ventilation in the restaurant and it doesn't help that it's grill-your-own so if you plan on going there on one of these hotter days (like we did) prepare to sweat or step out every now and then because I'm not kidding about how hot it is in there. 

The service was good - she came pretty often to make sure our waters were filled and it wasn't too hard to wave down a server when we wanted to order more. The food was great. I loved the meat - especially the beef. The bachan was also really good - a lot more better sides than most korean spots I've been to. One thing I could probably say besides the heat, is that the portions of the meat could be bigger (just in my opinion). Otherwise, it was still a good experience and a great way to end your night with friends."}
{"text":"First time coming here. Server was really helpful and polite. Food is amazing. They have lots of complimentary sides good for 2-3 people."}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant specially for student! I'm an international student and it's hard to eat Korean BBQ frequently because it's too expensive for us. However this place has special combo or special place everyday. I often go here on Tuesday because Pork belly and Pork shoulder butt are offered at half price on Tuesday!! (When we order drinks per each). Even if I order drink, it's a good price for us!! 

They serve some side dishes like Kimuchi, cucumber kimuchi, seaweed salad with spicy sauce and so on. Also, there are corn with cheese on the plate, a bowl of steamed egg and bean paste stew. I really like them!! 

However, they are very busy specially on Tuesday, I need to wait for one hour sometimes when I go there around 7 or 8pm. You should go early on Tuesday! Haha"}
{"text":"We love Ssam! The name derives from a Korean dish: you wrap BBQ into lettuce leaves essentially.

What makes SSAM stand out to me is how cosy and homey it feels. The staff is so welcoming and congenial, and the place is completely unpretentious. The Japchae I had was very filling, but maybe I would have preferred it with chicken? - if I remember well, we get to choose. The ssam is their main dish. They install the grill in front of you, fill it up, and your waiter takes care of the rest, so you get a show and a meal! I'll admit it can get awkward and silent, if I could change one thing about it, it would be the amount of meat that it includes, I can't help it, I want more!. Still, I have always loved going there, I can't bring myself to take a star away because of that.."}
{"text":"My new favourite kbbq place! Amazing food, amazing service. What else can you ask for?!

We got the Sunday special and while it was a bit pricey (our go-to kbbq place is Korean Grill House, because it's cheap for ayce LOL so we weren't used to this price!) but it was so worth it! They also give you a whole bunch of complementary side dishes, so you get what you pay for. When I saw how much meat they gave us, I first thought, \"I'm not sure that can fill me up\". But surprisingly, the amount of meat we were given + only one bowl of rice was more than enough to fill us up. We were so full we had to take the fries home LOL. 

As for the service, even though the place was busy, the servers always take the time to check up on you and ask you how everything is. They also make rounds with a water pitcher in had and refill your drinks without you having to ask. One server even said, \"oh! Why didn't you call for me?\" upon seeing our empty water cups HAHHAA. Now that's the kind of service you feel good giving tips to. :) 

If I have one minor complaint, it would probably the table size we got. The round tables (not the booth tables) on the side are fairly small, and it was a bit of a struggle to eat with all the side dishes on the table. Either way, I already can't wait to come back to this place!"}
{"text":"Great kbbq ala cart place! Ssam feature cool korean shareplates dishes and authentic bbq style food. The place is clean and the food is good. Service is also there! Servers top up your banchan no questions asked or sometimes they just even drop it for you! Been here 3 times and every experience was the same. Keep an eye on their daily promos everything is worth it'!"}
{"text":"My family and I stumbled upon SSAM by chance, as we were walking around the area and the decor looked cute. We were greeted by friendly staff and the atmosphere was very cozy. We didn't expect much, as the restaurant wasn't advertised much from the outside, but we were pleasantly surprised - we discovered a gem! The food was amazing and authentic. We ordered a bibimbap, which was generously portioned and flavourful, a pancake and order of rice cakes to share and ramen. Everything was very tasty and the service was impeccable - owners are very welcoming and friendly! Would recommend to anyone, and will continue to go back.

It is nice to have a tasty Korean restaurant in the area and not have to venture all the way downtown!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and we waited two hour. It sucks but it was a Tuesday and certain cuts of meat were half price after 5 PM.

The food was amazing. We ordered the ribeye and pork belly. It was delicious. None of the meat is seasoned so they give you sauces. 

The only thing is that this place is really cramped. My dad is a bit on the heftier side and he knocked some dishes over on the neighbouring table. 

Nice atmosphere for the younger crowd. Will definitely come back. Also, there is less of a wait for seats of 2."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best kbbq I've had. They have daily specials on the meats so the price is very good for the amount of food. The service was superior, as the waitor always checked up on us to make sure we always had refills of the side dishes, lettuce, etc. This is key at a kbbq since the table quickly gets filled up without any wiggle room with all the side dishes, empty plates, utensils. One of the waitress accidentally spilled a little bit of our drink and we got a lot of extra meat as a apology. The meat quality they serve here is very very good and it was very interesting dipping the meat with the soy powder they provided. I went with five other friends and ordered two of their daily specials, everyone was happily full and the bill only worked out to $20 per person. Definite must try!"}
{"text":"This place is a cook your own food kind of place. They have a metal grill set into the middle of a table. You order the proteins/veggies from the menu. Then you get a whole bunch of side dishes to go with the proteins of your choice. The waitstaff give you a piece of fat (pork I think) to grease the grill.  

I didn't want to go here. But my co-workers wanted to go to this place so I was out voted. At least I can say I tried it. I'm the kind of person who, if I'm going out to eat I don't want to be the one doing the cooking. I also don't like leaving the restaurant smelling like I cooked a meal. Especially since I had to go back to work after this. 

Given all this, the food itself was fine. We were the only people in the restaurant for lunch. I think this was due to the weather. The waitstaff consisted of a young guy who was more busy playing with his phone than paying attention to us. To get his attention I had to get up & go to the front of the restaurant where he was sitting. The decor is kind of fun & kitschy. It kind of looks like picnic tables set inside a restaurant as the seating is all wood. The tables are wood too.

Anyway, I personally wouldn't come back here, though the food was decent. I'm not going to pay a restaurant to cook my own food. I do this at home! LOL. Just a personal preference. But if you like this kind of stuff then have fun!"}
{"text":"My first time trying out this kbbq place after hearing so many great reviews on it. Came here on a Sunday evening and it was pretty empty at this time. There was also a daily special for the beef rib eye and pork shoulder. It was delicious, the meat tasted really fresh and it came with a lot of side dishes. The atmosphere was nice and dim. The place was also filled with a lot of cool antiques. This is probably my favorite kbbq place so far. Would definitely recommend this place if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Recently discover this authentic korean bbq place. I wonder why it is not well recognized as other bbq places. It has daily special, takes reservation, convenient location, cool decor.

Service was adequate, but I won't say it's perfect. 

I have been twice in two weeks and enjoyed their bbq and tapas. Korean Bulgogi Poutine and Veggie Cold Soba are must order tapas. Their unlimited banchans are tasty. Bbq comes with steam egg, cheese corn, soup and unlimited lettuce; meat portion is generous. 

The only complains would be their air conditioning. I wish it would be stronger especially having bbq in a hot summer day."}
{"text":"Used to be Crazy Wings which was my favourite bar in the past. Now it's my favourite KBBQ spot in North York.

Food: 4.5/5 

Solid KBBQ. I order their Chuck Flap and it's good quality meat. Excellent marbling and tastes great with their 3 different sauces. Also ordered their Bulgogi Kimchi Poutine and it was quite good as well. Their Jersey fries however come underseasoned or maybe they're too thick. 

Price: 4/5 

Some reviewers said it's pricey for the portions but it states outright on the menu that it's a 200g serving which is the same across the board at other kbbq restaurants. Given that, it's definitely cheaper than other popular rivals up north. The tapas were definitely on the pricier side however. 

Service: 5/5

I think they stepped up their service a notch after they renovated. Servers come by and check up on you more often, and they also make sure you know how kbbq works. They will also change the grill top for you if it starts to get charred. 

Ambiance: 5/5

Love the new look. The patio remains awesome as ever. They cleaned up the entire restaurant and the washrooms are definitely cleaner and inviting. Also a great place to come drink with friends. 

Overall, the change was for the better. I love how you can come for kbbq or order some drinks and a few tapas to hang out with friends. Will definitely be coming back more often."}
{"text":"In a word, perfect.

The place is cosy and slightly hipster, with the whimsical lighting, the wooden cabin-like interior; very clean. Ssam most definitely understands its customer base, with its hours extending from dinner into the wee hours. We came as party of 6 after a movie specifically for the BBQ special of the day (Wednesday's pork belly+pork false lean+beef short plate+soju/beer) and were seated at a booth with a table outfitted with an advanced/fancy electric range roaster (with built-in ventilation and digital sensor touch controls). We ordered double portions of the special as the server suggested one order could fill 2-3 people depending on appetite. She also explained to us that since they were out of the pork false lean, it would be substituted by beef ribeye, to which we all happily accepted.

Hardly a noticeable wait later, lettuce basket, banchan (honey potatoes, kimchi, spicy cucumbers, pickled daikon, tofu, nori), ssamjang (chili paste, soybean powder, salt/pepper and sesame oil, and a large soy and onion dip which is actually the perfect vessel to quickly cool meat off the grill unless you enjoy burning the roof of your mouth), an unassuming serving board with some handsome cuts of meat, and our soju were already on the table, with the server swiftly firing up the grill.

Another server, who I suspect may be the owner, came over and explained the cuts in terms of the part of the animal we were eating, as well as basic operation of the grill including the location of hot zones on the cooking surface. The meat quality exceeded my expectations and cooked easily and beautifully. In particular, the pork belly and ribeye were very delicious smothered in the various ssamjang enveloped in the lettuce. Everyone at the table had a different favourite banchan, mine being the potatoes. No shortcomings whatsoever in the quality nor the quantity of food presented.

The only thing that impressed me more than the food was the quality of the service. Servers were at our beck and call, topping up our lettuce basket without asking, and periodically without too intrusively asking us how things were going. At one point every square inch of our table was occupied by meat, dips, or banchan. One server had a bit of a mishap navigating to remove our empties and knocked over our bottle of soju; none got on clothing and we honestly didn't lose even half a shot's volume. Without hesitation, the server offered a complimentary bottle of soju for the trouble---but it doesn't end there. The owner came over and offered instead of the soju, a complimentary order of beef rib finger meat (roughly a $18+tx value, with soju at ~$16 if I recall correctly). We happily went along and of course, that meat was exceptionally succulent and tasty.

I truly had my doubts about this VIP level attention and thought it could have been because I was pulling out a camera (what does one call this...food blogger/critic favouritism?). On the contrary, as I observe from previous reviews (in addition to having discussed this with my SO who has previously frequented this bar), it is /routine/ for their servers to keep their customers happy with efficient service, consistently positive interactions, and last but not least, complimentary food (appetizers on the house on a whim!). I left quite satiated and paid less than $30 (tax and generous tip included). I honestly cannot find fault with my overall experience at Ssam---it was nothing short of warranting a perfect score. I haven't even ventured into those fishbowl-looking drinks and the tapas other reviewers have been writing about and I most certainly will be back to do so!"}
{"text":"Perfect and affordable.

We had a group of 4 people. We had the bill split individually and payed $12.70 each for table bbq the whole bill in total was $50.82. We ordered pork belly and rib finger meat and rice (ofc who doesn't love rice) , there was alot of side dishes and there was pretty friendly staff. Would definitely recommend if you have a group of friends"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my go to kbbq places uptown. They offer a great selection of meats with daily specials, plus a wide variety of korean tapas and alcohol - namely flavored soju. Ive visited this place before when they were Crazy Wings and I was thoroughly impressed with their food and service. I just knew I have to come back after their renovations. Low and behold, Im once again blown away by their impeccable service and amazing food. We went on a wednesday night, so we ordered 2 of their specials with 2 bottles of soju for 6 people. The waiter was attentive and friendly; they took the time to explain the different cuts, how to best cook them, and all the dipping sauces we werent familiar with. They always made sure we were comfortable and topped up on banchan at all times. The meats were fresh, and very high quality. They were so tender to bite into, plus this is the only place that I've seen that offers injeolmi as part of their dipping sauce for the meats (it pairs with the meats really well. Trust)

11/10 would recommend to any meat lover. You wont regret coming here."}
{"text":"First off the address on yelp is incorrect.  The location is right on finch and Yonge.  If you are going north it's on the left side right before the traffic light.

Food wise it's pretty good and price is pretty reasonable if you order the Korean BBQ because it comes with the side dishes and the side dishes are a lot and unlimited.

On Tuesdays it's half price off on pork belly with a purchase of a drink which is so worth it!  Your better off eating here instead of mcdonalds.  Would come back again for sure.  Staff is pretty nice and efficient especially on a busy night."}
{"text":"Best KBBQ experience in Toronto, period. 

If you didn't know, Ssam is actually the sister restaurant to Daldongnae which already in my mind earns major points. They carry all the same amazing banchan (side dishes), dipping sauces, and quality meat. With every order of meat, you get a soybean paste soup and a plate of corn and cheese.

I came here with my boyfriend and ordered the beef rib eye, pork belly, and beef hanging tender. Hands down our favourite is the beef rib eye - so tender and juicy when grilled. We also got a side of the cold noodles which was the perfect dish to cleanse our palette with all the heavy meats. Honestly, 2 orders of meat is more than enough for 2 people. We were way too full to finish the rest of the beef hanging tender.

Also, they used to be Crazy Wings before they renovated early this year so unlike Daldongnae, they offer Korean tapas as well where you can get wings, kimchi poutine, fusion nachos, etc. I was already so full on the kbbq that I didn't get a chance to try but will definitely do so next time I visit!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Delicious flavours. Various plates with different meat options & lots of vegetables. Good service and nice decor. Plates are well priced. Lots of beer options. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been to many Korean BBQ restaurant in Toronto and i must say this was the most disappointing experience i've ever had. The quality of the food varies depending on the day you visit. My experience was far from perfect on the first time so i went to go eat couple more times. Here's what i realized every time i go there. Servers are unfriendly and extremely lazy when it comes to any type of questions. I understand that Ssam is extremely busy on Tuesday but  they tend to have same habits on the other days. I felt like servers expect ALL customers to know what to order. It was quite challenging for people without any knowledge on Korean BBQ. There was time when I went with group of my friends on wed night around 12:30 AM. As soon as we walked in, one of the server threw the towel as he was cleaning the table. He immediately said to us that it was last call for kitchen and drinks so we have to order right away as we sit down. We were extremely rushed by a single server and we could not order more because they kitchen was 'closed'. I thought Ssam open until 2:30 AM? Anyways, i'm giving 2 stars only because of friendly female servers and food was just 'okay'. I think Piggy's have better quality and service.   Food 3/5, service 1.4/5, display 3.5/5 anyways, i don't think i would ever come back again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and really enjoy the environment, gives me a homey feel. Food and drinks came out promptly and staff are extremely friendly. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place does Korean BBQ the right way!
Make sure to get the ribeye beef. Sides were excellent and plentiful."}
{"text":"TLDR summary: good food, upbeat vibe but ventilation is poor.  

Conveniently located at Yonge/Finch, this Korean BBQ house draws a lively crowd for group dining and hangouts.  

Our group of four ordered the Monday special (meats below) for $59.99.  It came served on wooden platter with complementary sides like grilled corn and lettuce. 
- Pork Belly
- Pork shoulder butt 
- Beef short plate 
- Beef rib eye 

The raw meats do take time to cook so I would suggest getting side orders like their seafood Korean pancake and kimchi fried rice.  Pancake was well seasoned and had a light golden crisp on the bottom.  The kimchi fried rice had a pleasant acidity and was not too spicy.  I wouldn't recommend the cheese soft egg roll as it was too bland.

Overall, food was decently prepared and service was relatively attentive.  As the night rolled on, the place became stuffy as more tables began to grill meats.  Our clothings had a heavy scent of BBQ afterwards.  If the ventilation was better this would have been a five star review."}
{"text":"It's 32'c outside. A perfect day to have a cold beer. It's a BBQ place, but I just came here for a drink."}
