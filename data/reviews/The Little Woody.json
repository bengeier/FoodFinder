{"text":"A great place if you have friends to drink with! Lol. I dropped in solo one evening since it's close to home and only stayed for a few minutes due to the large groups of people that clearly know each other.. I'll most likely stick to pub houses until I'm feeling extra socially extraverted haha"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Friendly people, awesome bartenders. Skee ball,  Pool Tables,  darts, shuffle board, Foose ball. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I don't wanna play games when I'm drinkin' but if you're into that, you'll love this place. Decent beers, nice staff."}
{"text":"It's funny what a difference a couple years, and some positive buzz, can make. This place has gone from a quiet little neighborhood haunt to a hangout for Jersey shore rejects looking for a fight to a trendy hotspot - all while remaining essentially the same.

Nothing extraordinary in the way of decor, selection or service - but popular, so if  that's your thing enjoy it while you can - who knows what it will be in another year."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I just moved here and have been dying for a good negroni, I found it!  Dark interior, games in the back room, and fun bartenders. Sign me up!  My only complaint is the uncomfortable booth seats, but somehow I will survive."}
{"text":"From the outside The Little Woody looks like a hole in the wall dive bar. Once you go inside, however, it turns into a trendy neighborhood bar with great drinks, a great atmosphere and best of all Skeeball! They also have Shuffleboard, Foosball, Darts and some board games. 

This place just has a great neighborhood feel. I have not had their food but my boyfriend says they have great paninis!"}
{"text":"I don't think I realized how much I missed SkeeBall until The Little Woody brought it back into my life. And shuffleboard. Drinks are good, always fun here."}
{"text":"Great place! Staff is so friendly and helpful.  I am in love with skiball now because of this place. Come here for a good time Nd tons of fun."}
{"text":"And breeeaaathe in (a little)....

The (woody) smell! Huzzah!

It's hip, it's unmarked, it's lined with real wood, there's forgiving lighting, and a long, narrow arrangement of high tops, booths and upholstered seating... you may just have stumbled through a wrinkle into some mid-western time and space is all. 

We've had good service, and okay service. We've been when it's quietly populated, and full of busloads of revelers or scads of out-of-town bachelors. You just never know what you'll find behind that fire door off the parking lot. Look for the candles. 

Come ready to lounge. Order a signature cocktail, or ask the bartender to make something up. Don't let your buddy have that fifteenth rum and coke. Remember the bathrooms are very small. And become a bookie with a little known quote or a sketch as you pay your tab. 

You'll be glad you came!"}
{"text":"Fun neighborhood bar, with a new backroom filled with fun games such as skeeball!"}
{"text":"One of the best things about Phoenix.
Great bartenders. 
Great drinks. 
Fickle crowd but mostly good. 
I've always had a great time."}
{"text":"Great bar games, a cool vibe and they have Templeton Rye. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Trendy douchebag hipsters who think they're better than everybody else.

If you are a superficial person then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Fun place and high energy crowd for sure. I didnt see the game room just stayed in the main area but they have good service even though its packed. Only one bathroom but other than that definitely a hidden treasure. Can't tell what it is from the outside but we took our chances and ended up loving it! A little loud but a nice place to catch up w a group of friends"}
{"text":"Finally made it back to the Little Woody for a lovely date, both of us really love this place!  I tried a serrano-infused tequila drink, delicious.  We had a beet salad, tomato soup, and some pita thingies with pimento cheese dip (it's called something like southwest caviar on the menu?).  Both of the cheese dips I've tried are amazing, the beer cheese that comes with the soft pretzel knot is out of this world.  All the food I've had here has been crazy good, it's such a fun, cool place!!  A+"}
{"text":"I love this place! Their drinks and atmosphere are amazing! This is quite easily my favorite hangout spot!"}
{"text":"The Beeting!    Hands down best drink I have ever had.   Not to mention it helps my drinking habits feel healthy.   Great atmosphere.   Recommend for a good night on the town."}
{"text":"The wood details carried throughout make this bar so cozy and welcoming. You would not expect anything like it when walking up to it...true to the speakeasy feel.

Something about this bar makes you wanna drink a good craft cocktail...and they provide just that!  Also, the flatbreads and grilled cheese make perfect late night eats. 

Shuffle board / game room is the icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"Great little lounge!  

The Little Woody is a small place, no signage from the street.  The entrance is from the back by the parking lot.  There are just a few tables, a bar, a community table and some booths.  However, in true Vig form, the styling is second to none!  It's dark, homey, funky but with an understated sophistication.

The food is good.  We had a mushroom, truffle flatbread - excellent, arugula salad - good, beef and brie sandwich - very good.  A few cocktails and a few glasses of wine.  The service was excellent.  And (this is a big deal for me) parking was plentiful.

My only complaint was that the wine list was kinda sparse.  I'm not a big drinker, so it matters to me.

However, we'll be back - and we'll bring friends!"}
{"text":"What a great spot! Good cocktail and beer selection, surprisingly good food for a bar, and a great staff. The decor and atmosphere are cool, the crowd is diverse, it's a good place to meet people, and a fun place to go with your friends. It gets crowded late night and they have opened up a great game room for a casual hang. This will be a regular spot for me. I'm a big beer drinker but I'm hooked on the AZ Mule and the turkey cranberry sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Ambience is pretty rad... waitresses deliver speedily. Food is fairly decent. Overall great place!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite bar in Phoenix, hands down. Great ambiance, craft beers, great bourbon selection, The bartenders really make the difference though.  They are super friendly and remembered my name after one visit. I feel like Norm walking into Cheers there. Oh yeah, and there's skee ball!  For real."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places to grab a drink. We started early which left room to hang out and chat with Erik (GM/Bartender) - Super down to earth and welcoming! One of a kind spot, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Kristi is a real joy... I love getting 0% service and be completely ignored when trying to order a drink. Unless I am one of her ass-kissing regulars. And it's happened countless times."}
{"text":"This WAS a great little hideaway but has since become a place to see and be seen every night of the week. I still enjoy myself every time i go, and would have given 5 stars if not for the fact that you may find yourself shoulder to shoulder Mon-Sun after 8p."}
{"text":"Going to Little Woody is like having an exciting secret affair? You don't want everyone to know about it, but it's so much fun you don't want to deny yourself of the pleasure!

The little woody its a hole in the wall, little neighborhood bar that everyone in the hood knows about despite the fact there is no signage outside the lit up cartoon eyes in the front window and no main street parking!"}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasions and it's always had a great vibe. I came in this weekend on Friday and it was packed like usual.  I just wanted to point out that even though it was very busy, every single employee was still very helpful and polite.  Super impressed.  The late night food was very good as well"}
{"text":"The Little Woody is the best little Arcadia hideaway. You can only find it if you already know it's there - they've since added a red, glowing owl sign, but before that the only clue to this bar was the Jameson barrel placed outside the back entrance. On the weekdays, it's got a really relaxed, speak easy feel. It's full of the young professional, after work crowd (happy hour is every day from 4 to 6). Since it's been getting more popular, the weekends are pretty crowded with a mixed bag of people. Either way, this place is a fun time and full of activities. 

What activities, you say?

Board games and jenga hidden inside the bench seats, two skeeball machines that spit out free drink tickets when you get a high score, and foosball and shuffleboard. Every Third Wednesday they have speakeasy sessions of live acoustic with local artists. Every month they have a skeeball tournament to win prizes (like a growler full of beer).

This place is great and you should definitely check it out."}
{"text":"The real deal !  A speak easy in every way... There's not even any signage ;) once you find this Arizona gem you will understand, as the initiation for this place is just that. An initiation. So only bring your favorite friends to enjoy their wood lined cabin bar, skee ball, foose ball and dart games. The hand crafted and muddled drinks are amaze and the bites delicious. My favorites are the Arizona Mule and the Beeting.  Go. Go now!

P.s don't forget to sign and doodle in the guest books at be bar :)"}
{"text":"Great, friendly bartenders. Lots of fun bar games. Reasonably priced drinks. I'm in!

My only complaint is The Little Woody doesn't have a smoking patio, as in you have to leave your drink inside to step outside for a cig."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!! Finally had a chance to go this past Wednesday. The service was wonderful, the live musician was even better. We played ski-ball and darts in the back room. Definitely my new favorite \"upscale dive bar\"."}
{"text":"This place rocked!

Very leisurely lounge atmosphere. My wife and I enjoyed it as one of the stops my brother in law took us to while in PHX. 

There is some ginger beer / vodka cocktail that they are known for. Can't remember the name :) but quite tasty!"}
{"text":"This is a great bar.. it was not at all what I expected, but this is a great bar. 

So, I expected more of a club feeling and less of a dive bar when I walked in through the door in the back that offers no marking of being the main entrance that it is. So, in I went and sat at the bar.. ordering drinks that were more expensive than I expected. But the bartenders was nice and very good, attentive and effective.

The longer I sat in the bar, the nicer and more crowded the place became.. and when I left, quite overserved, the place had risen like a Fenix from a dive to a small, intimate little night club.. and I say this with respect. I did not expect this at all. Nor what I walked into, nor what I walked out from. 

While at the bar, getting served like a pro.. I discovered what many others has discovered before me, this tasty sneak attack called the Moscow Mule. Vodka hidden behind mint and ginger beer.. awesome. 

So, visit The Little Woody.. and when you see the eyes on the building, its there. 

.. und das ist nach der Kritiker"}
{"text":"Decided to check this spot out with a group of friends on Saturday and what a cool little bar! It's super tiny, like you could drive past it in a nano-second. The interior decorations are pretty sweet. They have this like wood wallpaper all around the place, super man-cave worthy. They have tons of silly named drinks on the menu, but I stuck with beer. The bar is super small, but the service was great and the people watching even better. it's a cool spot to jsut catch a drink and not worry about the outside world for a bit. All in all, cool little bar that I'm sure I'll make my way back to when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great pub!!!!!! Love it and the fact that the Vig Rig gets you home"}
{"text":"A friend invited us here after the haunted house. It was easy to find if you know what you are looking for...when we got in...the vibe of the place was awesome.

This is a place where you want to socialize and not so much chill because it's pretty loud. You can chill but just warning you, it's pretty loud. But the place was poppin.

There was a wall made out of logs which was pretty awesome. So when you go in it is the main dining area where the bar is...and there is a smaller room in the back with some games: foosball, shuffle board, skeeball, darts... (yes they cost money, but not much)

We played on the foosball for 3 bucks and it was a blast.

Their pretzel knot was delicious!!

Anyways, this place was pretty awesome for a Friday night!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to go to The Little Woody or what people called 'Woodys.\" We decided to go Friday, Aug 9th. I invited a bunch of friends and met for dinner first. Our waitress seemed flustered and the music was so loud she couldn't hear our order. We had to practically scream it. After about 10 minutes, we finally got our drinks. I ordered the Arizona Mule and there was barely any spirit in in. I know my Moscow Mules &  I've had better at Culinary Dropout. About 10 minutes later, our dinner. I ordered the Tomato Soup with Grilled Cheese and the soup was lukewarm and the Grilled Cheese has not even melted. It was still pieces of cheese and tomatoes. The boys I were with however, loved their sandwiches, so I decided to keep my mouth shut. The boys ordered another beer and we waited. Our other friends showed up and we wanted to head to the game room. After another 15 minutes with no second beer, we decided to move and my boyfriend had to go up to the bar and wait for a bartender to acknowledge him. When our waitress finally got to him, she didn't even remember the second drink he had ordered 20 minutes before. After the slow services and $70 later, we decided to check out the game room. There must not be as much A/C in that room because we were all sweltering in the heat. After sitting for a while, one of my girlfriends told me about their \"Golden Owl.\" If you find this small, golden owl that they hid in a different spot each night, then your whole tab for the night is free (not sure if that is true, but I would've taken a free drink.) We asked a few bartenders for hints and one said that it hadn't been found yet and another told us it is above eye level.  My girlfriend's and I FINALLY found the owl on a speaker and we went up to one of the waiters. The bar manager must have overheard us because he decided to go up the waitress and whisper something in her ear. He proceeded to tell us that someone had come in and found it during happy hour. It sounded extremely fishy and we thought they should have taken the own down if that was true. It might have been because we had a big group, but they could have at least told us that or capped the tab at a certain amount. We left immediately after. No one in my group said they would return and I know that I certainly will not. We all went to The Vig down the street and enjoyed appropriately priced beer and great service."}
{"text":"The wife and I came down to PHX to visit some friends this past weekend and came here for a nightcap after a stellar meal at beckett's table. 

The first thing I noticed is there is no sign for this place from the street, just a pair of neon eyes in the shape of woody the woodpecker, at least I think. The entrance is in the back. 

Okay, now that's out of the way let's talk about atmosphere and drinks. Both as you may guess, are fantastic. The place seems so small from the outside, but as you explore it just keeps opening up. Main room is a medium sized bar with damn efficient bartenders. Seriously guys, bravo. These bartenders are churning out craft cocktails in what seems like a minute. I started with a great old fashion, and then moved over to their take on a whiskey sour and it was the best I've ever had. A splash of Pinot noir to add some color and flavor. And the egg white perfectly foamed to perfection. My wife and our friends drinks were all really tasty too, and I wish I could remember the names. They also had a great selection of liquor in general and solid local and craft beers.

Ok back to interior. To the left is a large room with another small bar and a few pool tables. Awesome. To the right is another room through a short hallway and these great tall tables made of reclaimed wood. Oh and shuffleboard, skee-ball, darts. Maybe arcade games in bars are a fad, but this place pulled it off. It felt authentic, not campy.

Next time I'm on PHX, I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I don't know who they've got cooking over there, but they've a gift and great attention to detail.  Holy cow delicious!"}
{"text":"What looks like a nondescript dive bar from the outside turns out to be one of the coolest little places you can find. The whole place is very dark with the front room containing some seating at couches and tables along with the bar. Just with this I liked the place, but the other room is even better. That's where they have old school bar games like darts, skee-ball, and pinball. If you can't have a good time here you're not trying! Service was great and they had an excellent selection of liquor and beer."}
{"text":"I moved to Phoenix about a year ago, and am so glad a friend took me here. I don't live too close so I don't go often, but I will start going more once I move to a new (and closer) apartment next month. Staff is always friendly and attentive, food and drinks are delicious, and there are plenty of games to play if you're not the type to sit still at the bar."}
{"text":"Have always wanted to go there so stopped by yesterday and why did I wait so long? this place is so cool.....Eric the Bartender was fantastic and the moscow mule was amazing....Wished I lived closer so I could go regularly......Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is a great new addition to the Arcadia neighborhood; a nice little spot that's just a plain bar without all of the douchebaggery of the Vig, but doesn't exude the melancholy sadness of professional alcoholism like Darwin's or its predecessor, The Great Escape. Between the whiskey flights and constantly rotating taps, there's always something interesting to try, or you could always stick with the The Codger: a shot of Old Grand-Dad and a can of Old Style for five bucks."}
{"text":"Was visiting AZ & went here after a bday dinner for my cousin last week and five stars right off the bat for being opened late on a Monday night :) They have a HUGE selection of alcohol and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"A great central hangout spot! Awesome atmosphere, attentive wait and bar staff, delicious food and great priced drinks!"}
{"text":"This place is a perfect hideaway to duck in with friends. The staff are fantastic, the setting is awesome, and the drink lineup rocks."}
{"text":"Great little spot and delicious Arizona Mules! :)  There is also a back room that has skeeball and shuffleboard.  It's fun to play against new friends and the loser gets to buy a round of shots!"}
{"text":"Great dive bar where you can get amazing craft cocktails and beer as well! I'm obsessed with their Negroni. Lots of games available including pool, skeeball, darts, shuffleboard, three different rooms, and spacious inside. The bar can get a bit backed up on busy nights, but where is that not the case. Kind of feels like an upscale basement cabin if that ever were a thing. We brought a group of our friends here and they rave about it to this day!"}
{"text":"Cool little dive bar in the Arcadia area. If you come on a weekend late night, it will be a bit crowded but still easy access to the bar to get drinks fairly quickly. They serve a variety of beers and a list of cocktails and a wide selection of whiskeys and scotches too. Their music selection is on point and blend of 80s, 90, and early 00s to give you that nostalgic dance and sing along feel. They also have pool tables, shuffle board, fooseball, darts, and skeeball. A friend of mine actually met his now wife while playing a game of skeeball here."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Phoenix once a year for the last few years, and I think I've found my go-to bar for future trips in The Little Woody. My husband and I came for after-dinner drinks with two friends living in Phoenix, at the recommendation of another local. It was pretty ideal in every way.

The vibe was relaxed and kind of hipster, which is a quality I've come to appreciate in Phoenix. I loved the decor--there was an owl motif and the walls were covered in little cross-sections of wood, like a wallpaper made of coasters. There were games like darts and skeeball, which we didn't play, but enjoyed in theory. Instead we plonked down at a comfortable table--readily available at 9:30 on a Saturday--and enjoyed a couple rounds of drinks.

I had two cocktails, and both were excellent. The Beeting was delicious, refreshing and smooth with a flavorful dose of beet--made with Hendrick's gin, St. Germain, fresh lemon, beet purée, and ginger syrup muddled with cucumber and basil. The Rhubarb Rye Old Fashioned was a great take on a classic, a mix of Templeton rye and rhubarb bitters with muddled orange, Amarena cherry, and a sugar cube. Top shelf  liquor with balanced, thoughtful preparations.

Service was also fantastic. Our server Amanda was super friendly and attentive, even when the bar filled up toward the end of our visit. She even defaulted to splitting our checks, something that never happens in L.A. I expect to come back to Phoenix at some point next year, and I'll plan to stop by The Little Woody again while I'm there."}
{"text":"This is that place that I don't want to write a review for because more and more people will discover it! 

Here's the thing...I LOVE The Little Woody. I love the drinks, the decor, the hidden \"hide-out\" feeling, and the staff. My go-to drinks are the Sassafrass, the Arizona Mule, and the Tongue and Groove. I never go wrong with those three!

Unfortunately, the crowd here gets a little obnoxious for my taste. There are a few televisions around so at times the bar will be absolutely packed with screaming sports fans. If you go inside, you'll see that it's not the type of place you expect to see packed with screaming sports fans. Nor do you want it to be.

This would definitely be a 5-star frequent hang-out if so many other people didn't love this place too. Even if it was a more chill crowd that frequented The Little Woody I'd be more tolerant."}
{"text":"Polished artisan wooden tables, a buffalo head, a wooden owl, cow skin chairs, and a faux red snake skin couch are some of the pieces here to give you an idea of its style and ambiance. A little rustic, a little funky, but charming. It's like an odd log cabin.

They offered unique beers which was a plus. I ordered a Peach Ale with guacamole and chips which were both great. Service was fantastic, we were definitely checked on from time to time.

What I really love about this place is the music and game rooms, as well as the dim light, warmth, and cozy feel. I was here on a Sunday night and they played Smashing Pumpkins, Radiohead, Garbage, Blink 182, Green Day, Sonic Youth, The Blur, and The Verve. So if you like the 90's, you'll like it here.

They have two large game rooms. One has billards. The other room (behind the bar) has shuffleboard, darts, and skeeball.

The bathrooms could use some work, they seem like outhouses or the bathrooms you would use at a public park.

Overall, it was a great experience but it might have been because I came on a slow night so there was no line for the games or wait at the bar. I would recommend coming on a Sunday night or weekday night."}
{"text":"I heard all about this place from a good friend who recently moved to SB and after dinner elsewhere, their bar was packed so we decided to try out 'The Little Woody.\" First and foremost, I love the \"sign\" out front that has the light up owl. We parked just as a man was walking out of a door (one of three) in front of us, he kindly showed us where to enter, cracking jokes with us the whole way. We sat at the bar at first to get a drink from the same bartender. He showed me the whole menu cocktails and otherwise. I had no idea what I would want, so on his suggestion I tried to 'Tongue n Groove.\"

If you want a delicious girly drink, PLEASE try this. It was amazing. Sweet, with a little tang, and simply garnished. My friend had a jack n coke, and we went to sit on the couches on the other side of the bar. The bartenders were amazing, great service, super nice, they checked on us every little bit. Eventually we moved back up to the bar, and started talking to the barback, who suggested that we really check out the back room, so we did. It was full of games, shuffleboard, foosball, skeeball. 

We ended up staying for about 4 hours, and at the end of the night, my friend just HAD to have some Jeremiah Wheat Whiskey.... kill me. I hate whiskey, but it was good, 

The one thing I noticed was how adequately they staffed the bar. Three bartenders were there around 8 so you always had someone keeping an eye on your drinks, and never had to do that awkward wave until someone came over. The other thing I liked was the people there. Everyone from women in their 30's to men in their 60's. It didn't feel like there was a \"type\" of person who went there, just everyone.

I love this place, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Actually the best French 75 I've ever tried in my young age. This bar has a kickass whiskey flight selection, definitely recommend the Old Flight"}
{"text":"Let's just call it what it is: a hipster bar. My friend took me here as the \"best dive bar in Phoenix\" and I laughed and laughed. The drink choices are fun, but I don't really like the splitting of two spaces (the bar and the game area). If I'm in the middle of a game, I want to stay with my friends.... not disappear for 20 minutes while I get another drink."}
{"text":"When I first showed up at the woody, I noticed there was an extreme arbitrage opportunity.  I guess not in the true sense, as I didn't really make a profit off of these people, but what I'm trying to say is that they'll give you an old style and a shot of old grand dad whiskey for $5 (It's called the Codger).  That's 2 drinks people.  Yeah, they taste like complete shit....who cares, that's part of the fun.  The challenge, if you choose to accept it, is to get hammered for next to nothing.  They dare you to drink garbage, and reward you with a low price if you take them up on it, and if you don't throw up after taking the shot, GUESS WHO WALKS AWAY A WINNER....well kind of... Usually I lose pretty hard in the long run, because after doing 4-5 codgers over the course of an hour or so, thing go haywire.

One time I tried to open the men's bathroom, and it was locked. So I waited, then when the dude came out he was all like: \"THERE'S A LOCK FOR A REASON\". You are correct sir, apparently that lock is for you to do blow and have a temper tantrum if anyone so much as pushes on the door, why are you so angry? This is a bar bitch.  That's really the only doucher i've seen in this place.  The staff is always nice.

One thing I don't appreciate is when girls order wine at the woody, and then you're bill is suddenly $75, because someone had 5 glasses of wine and someone else had 5 codgers, and someone is signing receipts cross eyed, because they actually are $80 worth of drunk, but in the morning something doesn't seem to add up right.  Do the math on that, and don't order wine. Because in case you can't do math, it's $10 a glass.

The biggest problem the woody has, is that it's relatively hard to get a drink when this place is packed, which seems to be increasingly more often than not on your typical weekend.  Everyone has now discovered the woody, despite the lack of signage.  Hopefully someday soon all those people get over it and go back to old town, because I'm trying to have some room to run around in this bitch.

Also Skee Ball. Head to the back."}
{"text":"good beer selection. good amount of entertaining games to keep you happy. the crowd is pretty eclectic in age, tastes, style. it definitely puts me in the right drinking mood. i havent had their food here before but the menu looks pretty good. it does get pretty hard to get a seat or a table on weekend nights here. and the single occupancy bathrooms tend to create lines when busy."}
{"text":"Fun little bar in the Arcadia area. I finally made it here after hearing rave reviews and it's a very cool spot. They have decent beer on tap and creative fun cocktails. Sitting around drinking can get a little boring, so I was happy to play some of their games like Jenga. They also have a game room with two of my favorite games with shuffleboard and skeeball! Skeeball in a bar!!! 
A few negatives: 
- The service can be very slow, seems like they might be understaffed, it's better to order from the bartender. 
- The hummus tasted like paste, maybe this isn't the place to order food? I haven't tried anything else yet."}
{"text":"Great vibe..brings in some of the 'bro' crowd...if you ignore them it's a great place. They recently expanded it adding some pool tables...prices are great...food is surprisingly better then you would expect for the bar scene...bartenders care you are there..it can get super loud...usually lots of groups...and 'hunters'...go with your group and you will be fine. 

It's on my rotation. =)"}
{"text":"Fun \"dive-y\" bar in the Arcadia area with pool tables, dartboards, and hipster atmosphere. The Little Woody has a small menu and an impressive offering of whiskey and scotch, for those into the harder stuff. Service was very laid back....to the point my party thought our server had fallen asleep (translation: perhaps a wee bit more attention to guests please?). However, the place is comfy, not pretentious, and has enough distractions (read: pool tables, etc.) that even the more introverted types will have something to do."}
{"text":"My fav Thursday night hang out place. Little Woody never disappoints me. Creative drinks and cozy dark bar. My favorite- beeting! Yum. 
Do yourself a favor and visit The Little Woody on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"It only looks like a dive from the outside. Inside you'll find a whole variety of people, but mainly yuppie/hipster 30-somethings. Or maybe I only think they are 30-somethings now that I am 30-something? 

The main thing you need to know about this place: the drinks are stiff. 

Also noteworthy: Even when packed, the bartender will acknowledge your existence. They don't blink when I order a Sazerac. And there are bar games galore."}
{"text":"Loved everything about it.  Arizona Mule, atmosphere, skeeball.  Refreshingly free of Scottsdale douches."}
{"text":"The Little Woody is one of our favorite neighborhood hangouts on a Friday or Saturday night! I'm a true believer that they make one of the best Moscow mules in the Valley. I also LOVE the cucumber press. In addition to wonderful drinks and a cozy, speakeasy-ish atmosphere, they have fun games like darts, skee-ball, shuffleboard, and foosball. This place varies on vibe, sometimes it is super packed and wild and sometimes there is barely anyone in there. However, whether i'm with a group or just my fiance, we always have fun sipping on yummy drinks and playing games, regardless of the crowd! I know for a fact that we'll be riding bikes to The Little Woody again very soon!"}
{"text":"Had some after office drinks with some coworker there last night. Finding the place is half the fun. Once you are there, that's the other half. We pretty much took up the back room. From the sounds, everyone was enjoying thier drinks and the atmosphere. Don't let the out side fool you, go in and check this place out."}
{"text":"We were there on Friday night for a date night. We've been here many times and always had a good time. This time however, we were really disappointed. The bartender was not interested in serving us and was borderline unfriendly. I ordered two Moscow Mules and she never acknowledged that she heard my order. When she made them I said I didn't mean to be high maintenance but I thought they made mules in copper mugs. We like that they the mugs don't let the ice melt and keep your drink colder. Also, when I'm paying $9 for drinks I expect them to be better than the $3 ones I buy on Mill Avenue. She told me that they don't do copper mugs on weekends because they get stolen. I've been to the TLW many times on Weekends and that has never been the case. I've also seen a sign in the past charging ppl If they don't get the mug back. When we went back to the game room I counted about 4 other copper mugs on tables and realized the bartender was jut being lazy. At the end of the day I don't really care about the copper mug, I do care about bad service and seeing a place that I enjoy begin operating like a bar that is based on slinging drinks as fast as you can for drunk people. Hopefully this place will turn around but with as many new, fun bars popping up in the area it won't be that hard to choose a different spot for our date nights."}
{"text":"This place is aesthetically cool and has a great cocktail menu but the one thing that completely ruins the vibe is some of their regulars, particularly the group of classless blond brats that frequent this place. Last night these regulars yelled at a woman that was trying to enter and use the restroom, and then proceeded to take 20 minutes before they left said bathroom.

From the way the bartenders acted I could tell this establishment is under the thumb of a small group of well to do, reptilian people, particularly a group of basic, identical looking blonde girls. Honestly there are better places that have a better vibe and thus attract the best people: take a better chance with the bar at Buck and Ryder, or Undertow, The Tavern, or the Whining Pig. Sometimes a bar is represented by the people that show up and how those people act and treat everybody else and trust me, there are better places to spend your time and money at than a place like this."}
{"text":"Right off the bat, I'll tell you this place is rad but hard to find. When you see an all state building pull into the parking lot and you'll see a little wooden owl- that is the entrance to this hidden Arcadia gem- that could so quickly be any one's favorite bar.
This place is dark, when I think about it I remember red accent lights and a wall made of chopped wood, but it still had more of a loungey bar vibe, than a lodge ( which is what i think of when I see tons of chopped wood)
Next, the bartenders are SO knowledgeable. They taught my fiance and I how to truly do a whisky flight. They also made some awesome recommendations and truly crafted a tasty, deep, quality craft cocktail- probably one of the better old fashions I have had since moving to Phoenix-metro area. They have darts, pool table, a great whisky selection, knowledgeable and friendly staff and just a cool, underground type vibe.

Part of me doesn't even want to post this review, because I want to keep it my own little secret! But alas, I'll let you yelpers know so you can experience the secret coolness of this place :)

Cheers, friends."}
{"text":"I would not call this bar a dive bar by any means.  I really think I need to take my friends to a real dive bar so they stop tricking me into thinking we're going to one.

The staff was friendly, the drinks were good and while I didn't try any of the food it all looked and smelled very good.  It was a very busy night and was probably pretty close to maximum capacity.  A little crowded for my taste but I still managed to have a good time.  I learned how to play shuffle board for the first time and actually won a game.

I did have a good time however I'm not sure how likely I am go to back."}
{"text":"What a playful little dive bar! 

Let's try to look past the hodgepodge of an interior (which may be difficult), and focus on what TLW does well.

TLW does well at getting me soused. The bartenders are quick with the drinks, and are really good about cocktailing the lounge areas. I always had a tasty cold beverage in my hand.

TLW does well with the 'play section'. I could play foosball for hours! It's fun, competitive, and you could make it into a drinking game. The skeeball and foosball are great ways to interact with other patrons, especially of the female variety.

All in all, it's a great place for my friends and I to pregame. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, like most arcades games are overpriced and lack maintenance.  Serve at this place on a Saturday night was horrible.  They kept busing our unfinished drinks so hang on to your drinks folks.  The flat bread (Potato Leek/Sausage) was super yummy and decently priced of the portion. 

A small bar with a lot of attitude, just didn't care of the service; which is what this rating is based on."}
{"text":"Whiskey bar with a bunch of free games including pool?  I'm a fan for life!  Plenty of parking, hidden door, pretty cool spot to hang out and drink.  Shuffle board was fun.  Skee ball's a bit loud but still thrilling for a few throws.  Pool tables had decent poles."}
{"text":"It's a dive bar redone in wood. Big deal. Cute, maybe. The service is horrible. The alcohol selection stinks. Bartenders with major attitude. God forbid they have to walk out from behind the bar before a server gets there. I guess we weren't drunk enough to see the 5 glowing stars everyone else does. Blah..."}
{"text":"This is a great bar in the Arcadia neighborhood of Phoenix. Drink one of their fabulous moscow mules while playing darts, shuffle board or skee-ball in the back of the bar. This place can be a bit hard to find with the door to the bar on the north side of Indian School Road. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Visiting this fun Arcadia bar is like spending with rich college kids with bikes; everyone is young, well dressed and your select hangout locale looks trendy and cool. On the other hand drunken debauchery, bro dudes donning tank tops and faux hawks, squealing and fireball shots by the dozen seemed to prevail, no one had a care in the world. Did I mention it was 6:30? 

The Little Woody isn't hard to find if you look to the NE corner of Indian School and the side street (42nd place). Just pull down the side street when you see the neon bird eyes commanding you stop to have a drink. The bar is dark, covered in REAL wood cross sections and cozy. You can order food or play skee ball, darts or shuffleboard. There is no outside area so it's not ideal for smokers, but great when it's either a zillion degrees outside or pouring (like that ever happens). The bartenders were attentive and prompt. Overall, a great little neighborhood bar that's a fun stop on your Arcadia bar tour."}
{"text":"What a great find!  We stopped in yesterday for a drink on a friend's recommendation and we were not disappointed.  It is dark and cool and a great place to escape the summer heat in Phoenix!  The decor is pretty cool and a great place to relax.  The menu was surprisingly extensive - craft cocktails, beer, wine and food that sounded delicious.  We ended up sharing a pretzel knot and could have eaten 5 more...they were that good.  We'll definitely be back for more drinks and food next time."}
{"text":"I was deeply sadden when the world lost one of the greatest dive bars with the closing of The Great Escape. BUT The Little Woody instantly shot into my top 3 favorite bars in the city. Tyler, the GM, has created an amazing \"dive\" bar with unique features that include an open beam ceiling, wood log walls, rustic wood tables, and and very homey lodge atmosphere. You would never notice LW's as you drive by, which makes it such a cool place, but if you do notice it, you should stop in and grab a drink. Tyler and Kristy made me feel so comfortable and were extremely friendly to me and my friend. I will def be returning with jumps of joy!"}
{"text":"Super cool place to grab drinks with friends.  The bar is very cozy and has a log cabin sort of feel inside.  Awesome game room in the back with foosball, skeeball, etc."}
{"text":"cool place to chill out, great dive bar,   love the old style,  reminds me of chicago,  love the shuffleboard"}
{"text":"Tremendous little place.  The old fashioneds are epically drinkable, maybe too much so. The vibe is chill, Shannon/Amanda/Nico make you feel like you're amongst friends, and I've seen some of the highest skeeball scores of my life in the back room.

Pros:
Whiskey/scotch/beer list
The \"check presenters\"
Friendly staff
Back game room

Cons:
Newfound inferiority complex pertaining to my skeeball average score"}
{"text":"Unassuming is the best way to describe The Little Woody. From the street it looks like an abandoned building if I'm being honest, even the parking lot is dark and creepy (kinda love the vibe though). 

When you walk-in the main bar area feels kind of like a 1970s hunting lodge. My favorite room is the room to the left. This room feels like your grandparents basement, tacky wall art/wood paneling included. On the other side there's skee ball and darts, I feel like that side encourages a louder crowd than the pool table room.

The drinks are good, bartenders are friendly and the staff is quick to clean everything up. The Little Woody is a winner."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!!
Little house 
Vibe was super chill
Everybody that worked was happy to help and serve us

Live music"}
{"text":"Little woodys is the place to be! If you love a fun environment with pool, skeeball, darts, foosball, and shuffle board with a great whiskey menu, than this is the place for you! The staff is nice and the drinks are good prices! Do yourself a favor and come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great vibe. Bartenders and wait-staff extremely friendly. Reasonably priced drinks/heavy pour. Only downside is the limited beer selection."}
{"text":"My sister and her friends love this bar, so when visiting her last week we spent our Friday night here.  I was DD so was flying solo in the sober department, but the people watching and endless variety of games kept me entertained for the whole night!  

I am probably not the first person to say this, but winning a free drink playing skee ball is IMPOSSIBLE... but it's fun to try.  The shuffleboard is also so fun and is a rare find at bars.  Probably my favorite thing about this place!

From a past visit, I would recommend the moscow mule and they'll also make you a dark & stormy if you prefer rum.  Mixed crowd, relaxed vibe and plenty to entertain even the soberest person in your group - we'll be back the next time we're in town!

Oh - and you can park in the lot across the street for free.  Super convenient!"}
{"text":"Great service.   Elle really knows how the make those drinks! Jake is so funny! Jenga was cool because of the stuff written on the blocks"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere and good drinks. Only complaint is how PACKED it gets and it is a very small place. Definitely worth checking out though."}
{"text":"This is an overall decent place. I absolutely love the decor and the music they had playing was very cool. Definitely very hipstery and casual. Lots of bearded men.

I had a Moscow mule to drink and it was awesome! It had the real spicy quality to it that I personally love. 

It is a very small venue and it was pretty packed with no where to sit really. I liked the vibe of this place but it was definitely lacking in hotties!! Too many beards for my taste, and shaved heads, since when is that attractive. Anyways it's a decent place to chill with friends and they have a pretty sweet game area in the back."}
{"text":"This is SUCH a cool bar!  Speakeasy type (even though I knew that, it was still hard to find) with amazing cocktails AND bar games.  Great vibes, yummy drinks, and cool decor.  An awesome neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Well the first time I came to this location it's was the trusty ol' Great Escape and that was definitely a DIVE a legit \"hole in the wall\" ha! However it's is now an upscale/urban bar hangout. It's super cozy and it brings in  21-35 age group. I loved the music and decor. You are literally surrounded by logs. And the bar is perfect super old school and the bar staff are awesome. The only criticism I have is that the seatting is awkward and I wish there was a patio but I know because of the location there are legal issues.

All in all, I will definitely go back I live walking distance from it so its the perfect  for me,the boyfriend and friends to add this place to our bar bike tour ;)"}
{"text":"Great dive bar to hit up and relax. It has become a go to favorite as we have visited randomly over the years. My girlfriend used to think it was such a secret hideout and now it's pretty common place for us. Great location and fast service. The bartenders recommend specials and were quick to get us going.  Restrooms were clean and shuffleboard was well maintained. Looking for a small dive and feel without the skunky smell. This is your place."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars!  It's kind of divey but I love it.  The front room is like a normal bar and the back has a bunch of games including skee ball, shuffle board, foosball, and darts.  Really fun place to go at nights.  It's often our last stop for nights out.  Diverse crowd and laid back and fun.  The games used to be free but I think they charge for a few of them now (including skee ball) which kind of sucks but still worth going and playing.  Don't think I've ever had any of the food but heard it's good for being a bar. 

Tips:  It's hard to spot from the road even though it's on Indian School road.  People also call it Red Owl because of the lit up neon red owl on the window facing the road.  The parking and entrance are in the back.  There's also a free shuttle to and from the Vig down the street at 40th and Indian School."}
{"text":"This place is literally across the street from my neighborhood and I never knew it was there. I do remember wondering what that owl in the window was about. Then a couple months ago, my son-in-law told me he met a friend there and it was pretty cool. I decided to meet a work colleague for drinks after work. The place was dark, comfortable, friendly and relaxed. There was a welcome absence of posers. Our waiter was quick and courteous, not too chatty, but friendly. I ordered an old fashioned and my friend ordered a beer. Both came out quickly and I have to say, it was the best drink I've had in quite a while. It was strong enough to get the job done, with a touch of aromatics and orange peel. The single, oversized ice cube melted slowly, giving it just the right amount of chill without watering it down while sipped. It was so good, I had to order another. I heard comments that there was a hipster vibe, but I didn't really notice. It was more of a relaxed, in-the-know, classic feel, without the pretentiousness that some hipster haunts fall into. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT during the week. Friday and Saturday nights get really crazy, with the young 24 year-old bar crawl crowd coming through. Weeknights are best for me personally.

The food is great -- the guac is awesome. I love to come here for the happy hour specials. Great neighborhood bar but it's starting to pick up steam and it's very busy on weekends. The main female bartender KILLS IT. My go-to is the whiskey sour."}
{"text":"The Little Woody is an A-OK spot.  The drinks are decent and priced like other bars in town. LW usually has a good selection of craft beers on draft too.  The place is small and has two rooms.  The front room has the bar and a lounge area.  If you go around the bar, you'll find the back room that has shuffle board, skee-ball and darts.  The games always have people playing them, but you can just put a quarter down and be next to play.  There are a few tvs, but the games are where the fun is in this bar.  LW has a small food menu, but I've not eaten here... boyfriend says the flatbread is super good though.  The bathrooms can be a joke if the place is busy, and the bartenders may cut you in line if they have to go (happened to me)...  Oh!  And at a certain time of night the music goes up to an insane decibel of loudness.  Loud loud.  As in I got so tired of shouting at the person next to me, I just quit talking."}
{"text":"A visit to The Little Woody has been on my list for way too long and this past weekend, I finally got to visit! This little bar is filled with character and enchantment. Hidden in broad daylight right off of Indian School and 44th street, the only thing that shows you it's there is the owl (their logo) light in the window. You'll be greeted by an old gentleman who will let you into the parking lot and then you enter through a door into a windowless bar. Sounds shady right? Well, it's just shady enough to make it a little exclusive! You certainly wouldn't drive by it and decide to stop by. You have to know about it. 

This bar is trendy divey at its finest. Logs wallpaper the walls, and the lighting is dim. There's plenty of seating either at high top tables or booths. The bar has plenty of seating as well. But the best part is the back room. The back room is filled with fun games! Games that include skeeball, shuffle board and darts! If only they had air hockey and big buck hunt. It provides a fun atmosphere and one that's chill. This bar is well put together and well kept, but still holds on to the divey feel...without beer stained floors! 

PS - they also own The Westerner that just opened in Old Town."}
{"text":"You guys have no idea how long I debated whether or not to leave a review for Little Woody. It was pretty much a goal of mine to keep it as secret for as long as I possibly could, mostly because the place isn't that big, I live across the street, and I appreciate at least a foot of personal space.  Welp, that foot of personal space is almost gone now so I figure it's about the time to profess my love for this not-really-a-dive bar, especially since they just added the most AMAZING back room a bar has EVER had.

Seriously, I could set up a cot, eat, drink, and sleep in that back room and have absolutely no problems in life. They have shuffleboard, darts, and SkeeBall! Really, what more can you ask for?  In my original review of The Great Escape (R.I.P., gone but not forgotten), I concluded with \"If they had shuffleboard, I'd bump them up to 5 stars\"...Little Woody did me one better and got shuffle board while simultaneously getting rid of that weird old person basement smell the place used to have (and replacing it with the lovely smell of wood).  

What really makes this bar though is that everyone is seriously so freaking friendly. Once a guy asked me to punch him in the stomach...SUPER friendly because I love punching people.  Another time we sat down at a random table and played a game of RCL with a group of complete strangers, obviously awesome.  One stranger let me play with his iPhone 5 the day it came out just because I noticed it. I've only been mean-mugged like once and those girls clearly got lost looking for Mint, so that's not the Wood's fault.

All in all, I love this bar, I can now loudly declare that I love this bar, and if you want to come and be cool and love this bar with me you can. Just leave the mean-mugging in Old Town."}
{"text":"This place is the shit! We ended our night out at this place and it did not disappoint at all.

I love how they have the middle with the bar and some dancing, then you have a room on the left and the right with games.

You have one room with two pool tables and another room with skiball...yes..a bar with skiball.. how cool is that!? And they have shuffleboard and foosball.

It was awesome and I will be going back again!"}
{"text":"This is a really neat, hidden gem. Warning, if you walk in during daylight hours, it takes your eyes a while to adjust (I almost walked right into a waitress carrying a tray of drinks). The skee ball in the back is so much fun - it's almost like two different vibes in the two different rooms and you can't go wrong with either one. It's just something chill and different than a lot of other bars in the area!"}
{"text":"Giving this place a 5-Star review because it's amazing and I love it. Come here all the time. 

BUT 

The server I had last night was awful. I ordered the Mac and cheese with sausage. She says they don't have sausage. I ask if they took it off the menu. She says \"I've worked here for two years we've never had sausage\". I come all the time and order the same thing every time, but i was with a group and didn't want to make a big deal about it. So I said bacon was fine. She leaves, comes back and says \"I asked, it's chorizo not sausage.\" -_- I just said ok that sounds great. Chorizo is a type of sausage and she REALLY was insistent that I was wrong at the table in front of everyone. 

If you work somewhere for two years I'd hope you knew the menu and what options are available. 

When you go you should definitely order the Mac and cheese with broccoli and chorizo. But make sure you say chorizo."}
{"text":"Hipster central.  I think the statute of limitations has passed so I can confess that I once got drunk with some of these hipsters and *may* of taken home one of the ubiquitous owls littering the place.  I enjoy the backroom where they have adult Disneyland complete with shuffle board and ski ball.  Drinks are solid and if you are hungry, the pretzel is amazing.  I will say that I was not happy with parking attendant grouch who let me park my car and then tell me that I couldn't park there after I hoofed it across the parking lot in heels...."}
{"text":"Ahhh The Little Woody, a fabulous name for a fabulous bar.  This small place is packed with a bunch of alluring qualities - great selection of beer on tap, really good looking people slinging drinks, game room, clean restrooms, dark sunken in booths perfect for getting lost in conversation with someone.  I love this bar and you will too."}
{"text":"This place is super cute and so much fun! The people who work here are so awesome and knowledgeable. Shout out to Amanda for making my first experience so wonderful. Five stars to little woodys!"}
{"text":"I accidentally posted my check-in here on facebook and subjected myself to about two hours of ridicule for hanging out at a place called The Little Woody. I like it here because there is no signage from the street. 

Once you park in the lot and enter through the back door you'll find yourself in a pretty small, low lit bar. The walls are adorned with wooden logs, hence the name. Keeping with the tradition of The Vig and The Vig uptown, the place has a cool vibe and they play good music. When i got there it was standing room only, so despite the obscurity from the front, a lot of people know about it. There is communal long table in the center, some booths and another area with some couches to lounge.

This would be a great place to come on a double date or a small group of friends and cozy up in one of the booths and have a few cocktails or beers. I can't wait until winter because it will be a great place to hit when it's chilly outside."}
{"text":"4 stars. 

1 star for being in my hood. 

2nd star for being chill. 

3rd star for having a kitchen open late night.

4th star for the pickles. 

5th star is absent because I think that although available, the food is overpriced and marginal at best (except for the pickles, I want to make sweet love to the pickles). If you're going to charge THAT MUCH  for a half ass grilled cheese at 11:30 pm, please AT LEAST have home made chips, not out of the bag Lay's original. 

word."}
{"text":"I love this place. Pretty neat spot that is a lot of fun and chill at he same time. I met Elle and Amanda the first time we came and I swear we always come here now. Elle is just cool! Amanda had the best attitude. The bartenders are the best and it's super easy to just have fun. The drinks and food are always on point!"}
{"text":"Great little bar.  I had the hard wood cocktail which is made with Jamesons and was very good.  Scored a great seat on one of the couches which was really nice."}
{"text":"Ok...long time since my last review.  I finally had a chance to hang out with the beautiful wife at The Little Woody.  My first time there but my wife has been there before and enjoyed herself.  Truly a local spot that is somewhat hidden but a neighborhood gem!  Upon entering the establishment, especially during the daylight hours, be prepared to have your eyes adjust to the windowless environment.  Seems very small when I went in however its larger that someone would initially expect.  This is not a sports bar!  Which is great change of pace and totally invites intimate conversation with couples and a really chilled hang out place with friends.  Once you enter the bar is to your right with a couple of tables to the left and directly in front.  Surprisingly there are some bar games that are around the corner from the bar on the west side of the building such as darts, shuffleboard.  There is also an additional bar if the crowd size overflows into the room.  On the east side of the building, there's another room that has 2 pool tables plus additional seating.  I was not expecting that.  The service was outstanding!!  The bartenders; tattooed sleeve tender, the formally dressed tender and Seth Rogan lookalike!  They were great!  As simple as it sounds, try the pretzel with the 2 dips that it comes with.  The ambiance is a great diversion from the chain bars that are out there.  Lastly, if you are bold enough...try the gunshy sour drink, its great!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to take friends. Love the different rooms and vibes they give off. Games are always fun!"}
{"text":"Skee Ball, Shuffleboard, Darts, Foosball, board games, etch-a-sketch and a neighborhood feel.  Always a good time at the Little Woody. The cocktails are imaginative and typically the bartenders ensure the pour is nice :)

The only complaint I have about this joint is the overwhelming sulfuric scent emanating from the women's bathroom in the front of the bar.  Not sure if this is like this always but the last few times I've been here it was almost enough to make me ralph."}
{"text":"A must stop for Phoenix bars. Perfect for dates and the inside is decorated so cute. Owls, dim lighting, logged walls. I love it. Strong drinks too! What's not to love? Wish it was closer to me."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting and came here to meet up with some folks.   This is a great divey bar in Phoenix.  I was there on a weekday and it was pretty chill.  Cool vibe and cool set up.  It was not too busy and was very easy to grab a drink.  Cool spot in Arcadia!"}
{"text":"Best bar in Phoenix. Period. 

Not a good place to go if you are wanting to quit drinking."}
{"text":"Love this bar! I used to go here when it was a super-dive a couple of years back. It's amazing what they have done with the place!

Went there on a Saturday night - wasn't too busy but had a good amount of people there. Was very happy to see at least one awesome bar that has reasonably priced cocktails. Definitely going back :)"}
{"text":"Bacon should be a bar tender...great attitude and innovative drink ideas....Little Woody is my favorite dive bar in Phoenix"}
{"text":"The owners/operators of \"The Vig\" finally did us socially anxious types a solid. They built, for what for all intents and purposes, is a speak easy in the heart of what once was the glorious enclave of Arcadia. For those of you desert dwellers not familiar, Arcadia once was a swath of homes and businesses in the heart of eastern Phoenix with money and prestige that made Scottsdale residents once drool with envy.  Suburban sprawl and urban blight have regulated parts of this town into cesspools of poverty; some of the money has stayed put but now it is \"old\" money and Arcadia has suffered.

Located upon the bones of the \"Great Escape\" (a place that put the dive in dive bar) the only outward sign that you are in the right place is a giant flashing red owl face; the original building facade from the \"Great Escape\" still remains intact and lends to the mystique. Around back you'll find a (likely) packed parking lot, plenty of security (on most nights anyway) and a pair of faux gas lights beckon you in.  This is where my love/hate with the Little Woody begins.

The room(s) are simply stunning and anyone with vaguest idea of those responsible for the various \"Vig\" establishments will understand that one of the things these folks know how to do and do well is make a fan-fucking-tastic room.  Personally, I'm a huge fan of the under lit bar, old school (and I do mean old) cash register behind the bar and the unexpectedly awesome musical accompaniment. The drink menu is top notch (with the rhubarb old fashion at the top of my list) and while sparse, there isn't much on the menu that you will regret ordering. For the most of staff is competent and the game room (check it out for yourself) is a nice touch that maximizes the minimal space available.

 I can't tell you how badly Phoenix needed this place...which is why I hate all of you for ruining it for me.  When the space was open for Sunday football I could at least enjoy some of the managerial/ownerships delectable eatable experiments, suckle at a bacon infused bloody Mary and watch my better half down a staggering amount of blood orange mimosas.  All of these are now gone (it turns out even our penchant for alcoholism couldn't save Sunday days) and those I know and love have been regulated to slinking in mostly on Sunday afternoons right when the place opens. Why you may ask? Simple; this place isn't a secret speak easy anymore.

On any given night the place is packed elbow to asshole with a vast assortment of individuals that have the social skills of a salted slug. But alas...there is money in this crowd and they suck down the crafted drinks on the menu like a citrus deprived sailor in an orange orchard.  I'm can't stereo type the entire crowd as such...simply put, as the popularity of the Little Woody has increased, I haven't been able to spend more than a few minutes in the place before my blood pressure sky rockets and I simply leave without ever catching the bartenders eye. But what's bad for a few is good for so many more; if I could stomach the patronage more perhaps I could rekindle my love affair with my beloved Woody?

Seeing as how I really don't give a hoot...if any of you out there in internet land decide to open or come across a bar named \"Nicodemus's Perch\" or \"N.I.M.H.\" please let me know. In the interim, to the lee of the stone we must go."}
{"text":"The Little Woody has been my go to bar lately! It has a relaxed, chill vibe. It's got three separate rooms, each with a slightly different feel. It's dark and cozy and I love the decor, especially the buffalo. It's always the perfect amount of busy while not being overcrowded (aka people aren't bumping into you the entire time). I haven't tried any of their cocktails yet but they have a great selection of beers on draft. I have been going with the McFate IPA."}
{"text":"I have made several ventures to hang out here and sadly.... The Little Woody is not my idea of a good time. Here's why:

-The service is slow (but I'm not blaming the servers, I know they're trying to maul through the abundance of human flesh standing, sitting, and loitering in their way). 

-The bathrooms ALWAYS have a huge line. And if there isn't a line, there is a drunk girl puking in it and so I am just the first in the line that is sure to begin. 

-I'm pretty sure fire codes are constantly being violated in this place. There are just way too many people here and it's ALL OF THE TIME. It's not like it's just the weekends... oh no.. it's the weekdays too. Which is AWESOME for their business but horrible for their customers who, like me, get extremely aggravated in confined spaces with 5 billion other human beings.

-I think it's a rule that when you hang out here you have to be loud, obnoxious, and way too intoxicated to make quality decisions. I swear. Everywhere I turn here, I was bombarded by another drunk person screaming in my ear about the skee ball tables or the drink they ordered.

-The drinks are overpriced. Plain and simple. I know this bar is in a nicer area and that the clientele are (supposedly) a little more mature (haha) and make decent money, but I could get the same drink a few streets down for HALF OF THE PRICE. Also. I don't ever think $10 is appropriate for a SMALL beer. Nope. Never. Not even Guinness or other \"fancy\" beers. 

-Lastly... And I mean this in the least conceited and rude way possible, but I don't want to be hit on by men who are old enough to be my father. Thanks, but no thanks. 


Aside from all of the things I don't personally care for, The Little Woody has a very nice staff (including the Bouncers) and the decor is cute. Actually if it weren't always more crowded than the DMV it would probably be one of my favorite bars to hang out at because of the ambiance. Overall, you do not COMPLETELY fail, Little Woody, however, I will not go out of my way to return unless requested by a friend."}
{"text":"Great find in the neigborhood. Great live music and service. Good happy hour and flatbreads. We will be back!"}
{"text":"After attending a Yelp event, I didn't want to go home just yet. I wanted a cocktail but had no idea where to go as I don't live here. I turned to Yelp for suggestions and went to 2 or 3 bars before I actually ordered a drink at Little Woody. The other bars just didn't have the vibe I was after.

Little Woody was cool as it was a little hidden and was playing some good music when I walked in. It's a small place so the 20 or so people that were here made it seem busy.

Bartender cooked me up a custom Oban-based cocktail. It was a little pricey at $13 compared to their $8 cocktails on the menu, but I have expensive tastes so oh well. It was pretty damned tasty, and I always appreciate an off-menu custom-crafted cocktail.

I have a feeling I'll be back again next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"During my great Phoenix booze search in the fall of  2012, I turned to my trusty Yelp friends on Talk and proposed the question: Where is the best place to go for a good selection of whiskeys at a decent price. I got many useful responses, but Marsella M. hit the nail right on the head when she suggested The Little Woody. I never heard of the place and it was close to my home so I was intrigued. I checked it out one night after work and had some trouble finding the place since there are no signs. I figured out where it was when I saw the neon owl in the window. As you walk up to the door you don't know what to expect and it feels like you are going into the back entrance of a restaurant. Upon opening the door though, you are immediately greeted by a cool relaxed lounge, perfectly decorated and welcoming. 

This is an all around great bar and I might rank it as my favorite in Phoenix now. It has all the elements to make it a great place for a drink and some food.
1) It's hidden, so you have to be in the know to find it.
2) Great bartenders, drinks, and specials
3) Very cool and modern decor
4) There are two separate rooms, each with a different vibe. The main room with the bar has couches, a long high top, and booths. The back room has some great games, including skee ball, darts, foosball table, and I think a pinball machine. Great overall set up for whatever you're in the mood to do.

Also...
Plenty of whiskey flights to choose from. On Mondays they get new drinks for the patrons to try out. Lots of Four Peaks beers. Their house special is called The Codger: $5 for a can of Old Style and a shot of Old Grand Dad. 

This place had the Review of the Day yesterday on Yelp, so it seems the secret is out and I'm sure more and more people will start flocking to Phoenix's best secret bar. 

Ya know what, this place stinks. Don't go here ever...unless you already do, then you can still go. Otherwise, it isn't worth your time. Seriously. Just go to Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Fun spot to play bar games and drink. They have skee ball, shuffle board, darts, foosball, and Jenga. Hard to spot at night so keep an eye out for the red owl!"}
{"text":"Cool spot. I was here early on a week night. The place wasn't too busy but the locals and the staff insisted that after 10 this place lit up. I had to leave before that, unfortunately, but enjoyed myself and plan to visit again someday. Like other reviewers, it's difficult to find with limited signage so use your landmarks!"}
{"text":"Perfect for a weeknight drink and some game time! Not busy at all, but just the right amount of people to build a pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"i'm totally over this place. 

when they first opened, i really enjoyed this hidden little neighborhood bar and their fun selection of drinks.

cut to six months later and this gem has warped into some overblown douche trap. \"hidden\" bar? yeah, not so much. when there's valet parking, a bar expansion, wall to wall people, and horrific service from the waitresses/bartenders, i wouldn't call this a neighborhood bar anymore.

oh, and their previously awesome drinks are totally mediocre now. 

no. thank. you."}
{"text":"Limited edition (Rotating mule and old fashioned) AMAZING. Get it while you can, before I drink them all lol. Idk why these guys don't have 5 stars, the mixology is out of this world!"}
{"text":"This place is super hip and laidback... a true gem in phoenix. The server that me and my girl had was really awesome. She had a great true personality and was always smiling. This place has a nice selection of microbrews on tap.  The only thing I didn't like was that the game room felt too small and the skee ball was 1 buck to play for 1 person."}
{"text":"In my search for a new place for my husband and I to try, I came upon my friend Paul V.'s review of The Little Woody, and I was sold.

It may be a little hard to find (hint: just look for the owl), but once you do, youre in for a great time. Its dark and warm and inviting w/ plenty of seating to choose from.

We decided to try the food as well as the drinks. I had a brie panini, which was really good, but the star here is the craft cocktails. I had one whose name escapes me, but it had muddled strawberries. Very good, sweeter. I also tried the Hard Wood. Very, very good.

After we were done eating we decided to explore the place a little bit. Unbeknownst to us, they have a whole other side! Complete w/ skee ball and shuffleboard. They even host an adult skee ball league.

I would absolutely recommend this place to someone who wants a cool place to drink w/ friends, take a date, or have a drink somewhere thats off the beaten path.

i know *I'll* be visiting when Im back in town. Just sayin."}
{"text":"This bar is typically a place I would not go into. It is small and has a sketchy side entrance. HOWEVER I had the most fun in this bar the night I went. They are ski ball and a Foosball table which I thought was so unique. Shockingly, by 12 this place was full of people. I would recommend people to go with with a close few friends it definitely is a local bar to the community. Their prices on drinks are pretty reasonable too!"}
{"text":"I was not a fan of the vibe or the service. Would not recommend this to anyone visiting us in Phoenix, but it is a pretty low-key spot if that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time last night with my boyfriend and brother (two polar opposites) and they both loved the atmosphere and energy. Service was amazing and the drinks were solid. I highly recommend the pimento cheese dip, so yummy! 
I will def be back with my girls to play some ski ball!!"}
{"text":"Just revisited and was stoked to find out that they've expanded the building to now include *dramatic drum roll* a seperate gaming room!  Was totally stoked to find this out.  It only adds to allure of the bar and keeps the good times rolling literally!  They've got a foosball table, darts, rollerball and shuffleboard!  No idea when they put it in but from the last time I was there it wasn't part of it and now that I know I'll be spreading the good word!  Had a few cocktails and the signatures were spot on but some of the other traditional cocktails we're something more to desire but the beer selection definately made up for it."}
{"text":"very small hidden bar. Would be fun with a group of friends if you went early and snagged a game or bar seat. Cute decor normal prices."}
{"text":"Fun place- lots of games, nice people, good drinks."}
{"text":"Fun dive bar. You got to get there early to snag a seat or be a hawk to get one. For being so inconspicuous and hidden they sure get busy. Good bar hopping place to hit up"}
{"text":"Little Woody is a great neighborhood bar in the Arcadia area!  It's a small place, with 2 separate rooms.  One room (the main one you walk into) is your stereotypical standing bar with table, booths, etc for noshing, drinking and socializing.  The back room, though, is where the magic is.

The back room is basically an adults arcade.  There is skeeball (you can win prizes if you rock at it), shuffleboard, darts and fooseball.  It's a great way to meet new people (everyone loves a little friendly competition) and keeps the atmosphere light and amiable!  

I only knocked down the place by 1-star because it can get a bit overcrowded there on the weekends, but other than that one issue, Little Woody is definitely a place I recommend to check out for a good cocktail and some fun!"}
{"text":"Came here during a weekday. It was really empty. The place is really cool. A lot of different games you can play with. It is a cool place to chill and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Oh, Little Woody, I love you so much...

Whether my friends want a chill round of beers on a Tuesday or amazing people watching on a Saturday, we usually end up at the Woody. Great beers and whiskey drinks, good food, and wonderful bartenders."}
{"text":"Want to feel like you are in a tiny cabin in the woods in Wisconsin?  Go here. Want to feel like it's nighttime even at 5 pm in the middle of the blaring hot summer? go here.

Now, it's crowded as hell and they have a great happy hour that many poepel know abouot so you have to deal with that.  But this is a quaint bar with lots of charm. 

but you have to know where to find it.  Look  for a non descript  non bar looking place with a really small owl in front.  That is about it. Parking SUCKS  during HH. Be prepared.

The back room offers up games and the front room is more like a cabin in the woods feel."}
{"text":"ok am i only only person who thought this place was a strip club? its HIGHLY indistinguishable from the outside main street and all the windows are black over. you enter from the back...and its called the little woody.

am i crazy?

needless to say, i totally get why this was the picked location for a friends b-day adventure. its quite unique, a hidden gem. really surprising case of a \"dont judge a book by its cover\" as they do some craft cocktails and have a lovely american new menu written via the ver-popular chalkboard approach. i didnt eat here, but looks promising. i ordered a tequila mule with the house tequila and it was quite tasty. served in the proper copper mules. i am a mule snob, so i approve. i believe mules were $7, so slightly under my san diego hometown typical pricing. so skewed...maybe a little pricy for PHX?

the thing that really got me, which isnt a very california thing, is the second room...the game room. LONG shuffleboard table, 2 skee balls, dart boards, video games. so much fun to be had! worth a visit for sure."}
{"text":"love this place and all the games......  bar service is too slow and the waitresses are unfriendly........  The thing about a local dive bar is it should be friendly and make you want to come back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere as always but I was disappointed with the cocktails this time. For $12- $13 I have pretty high expectations and they fell short... Old Fashioned was about half the volume as normal and the Manhattans were below average (way too sweet and couldn't even taste the bitters). Certainly didn't feel like they were \"craft\" cocktails..."}
{"text":"The Little Woody is a fun place with its high energy crowd. Small and always happening on weekends, this isn't the place to be if you suffer from claustrophobia because it's jam-packed nuts to butts in here.
So here's what you do.

Make up some stupendous bullshit about how you scheduled your bunion surgery for Friday afternoon and need to take off work after lunch...then head to the Little Woody for pre-game. Hang here till the place starts to fill, then bounce around six.

There's a bar across the street on the second floor, I can't remember it's name. They serve giant hamburgers. I know this because some middle-aged guy trying to scam on a girl half his age ordered one and had it split. She didn't eat it because she was all, \"What'd you order that for...I don't eat red meat.\" 

Of course she doesn't. But I do. So I winked at the guy and he slid her plate my way. 
It was a good half burger. When I was numb, I went downstairs to La Fontanella to eat a bunch of Italian food. 

Anyways, oh yeah, The Little Woody is fun when you can have it all to yourself. Otherwise, get ready to do battle with the chick next to you, hoping to get the bartender's attention. Good luck. As if he's going to notice you when her thong is hiked up to her ear lobes and she's wearing a low cut top.

Don't forget to limp into work Monday and remember, you've got ten toes. The bunion thing should get you well into the winter months before having to come up with a new Friday afternoon affliction."}
{"text":"This is where I met boyfriend almost 2 years ago! We have gone here on a regular basis ever since and they are always great. I love that hey are super popular but you always feel like you are walking into a speak easy. The game room was such a great addition and we have had such fun going in for a couple of mules and games before heading in for the night.

All of their drinks are refreshing and secretly strong...which is my favorite. Their staff is always friendly and fair. We love this place."}
{"text":"This bar is awesome to go to if you are a classless, reptilian blonde. The bartenders are always super nice and friendly to you. They have amazing drinks. The only warning I would have is watch out and make sure people don't think you are yelling at them in the bathroom if you are just trying to be drunk best friends with them! Love this place, always a good time."}
{"text":"First visit, great! Second visit, Little Woody must be bi polar.  A few friends decided to go to Little Woody on a Friday night.  There were a pretty good crowd of Phoenicians and people obviously from Scottsdale.  We ordered drinks and food from the waitress.  We never saw our waitress but one guy was going around asking people about their drinks.  After 30 minutes of ordering a pretzel and pizza, I asked how much longer will it take to get a pretzel.  He was nice to go check and I didn't get charged for it.  The waitress never placed the order for the pizza, lame excuses. We left and went down the street to eat..so worth it too!"}
{"text":"look for it, look for it... wait turn around.... you found it.  Now go in and enjoy... THANK YOU Tucker, Kevin - drinks were great! First timer here and already have plans to come back on Saturday. Walls are lined with cross-sectioned logs, place has an over all rustic feel. Glowing red bar adds some fun.  Definitely deserves a few returns."}
{"text":"Great little dive bar. The food is much better than most dive bars and they have fun games in the back. Better during the week as it gets pretty busy on the weekenda"}
{"text":"I just didn't get the appeal of this place. It was rustic and woodsy, I got that much. A dive bar for sure, but really dark and not very appealing to me. There were many interesting seeming people, but I just didn't feel like it was very welcoming. My companions and I got a drink, sat on the couch, and took off a short time later. Just not quite my scene."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for every time. A great place for friends is a great atmosphere. It's always fun, and in the end you get a good mood for the rest of the day. And the food is as good as the staff."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, nice bartenders, cozy decor, great hefeveisen choice, san tan i think....very good place, cute and neighborhoody!"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE bar! The bartenders are the BEST, prices are great and we have a skeeball league every Thursday there and we always have a blast!! This is definitely a bar I recommend to all my friends!!"}
{"text":"The Little Woody is a hidden gem in Phoenix.  I've been here twice and each time I go I love the atmosphere and especially the drinks.  They know how to make some good drinks at this place.  Ordered up an old fashioned and normally I don't order them unless I know for sure it's going to turn out right, but the bartender assured me he knew what he was doing.  He was right, because it was one of the best old fashioned I've had in a while.  They also make a pretty good moscow mule, but the drink menu is filled with other amazing cocktails too!  Great music and great drinks to hang out with a few friends.  

I wish I lived closer to this place because I'd be here every weekend and possibly a few times during the week."}
{"text":"I almost hate to yelp because its so outstanding and such a hidden treasure! Its a charming dive bar with fabulous bites and great service! My new fave! LOVE!"}

(Woody Woodpecker)

For those of you old enough to know the Woody Woodpecker this place is a like an homage to the character.   The only way you'll find this gem is by catching the eyes of the woodpecker off Indian School Rd.

At first sight you wouldn't think much of this place from the outside.  Once you enter it's a nice cozy chill atmosphere.  I'm glad this place is here far from the party scene of S. Scottsdale.  Everyone seems pretty relaxed and open.  They're not here to impress anyone; they're here to have a good time.  The place in general is covered in \"wood\" and has a cabin look.  Thus, the \"woody\" part makes sense.  

Moving, past the main doors and towards the back and going West of the building is the game room.  Tad bit odd for a lounge, but totally awesome.  Shuffle boards, skeet ball and darts in the back room while you have a drink with your best buds in case you didn't want to just sit around at the bar.  The large LCD TVs shows the game of the night while you sit back and enjoy. 

The Woody also serves up some cozy comfort food.  My buddy and I ordered the tomato soup with grilled cheese sandwich.  I wasn't too awed about the sandwich, but the toast on it made sense to my palate as I dipped it into the roasted tomato soup.  The soup was delicious!  I pounded it down with a couple of drinks and my night was complete! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Without the neon cartoon bird decorating the front window, you'd never find this place while driving. I stepped in to be greeted with dim, red light, freezing A/C, and Miike Snow blaring from the ceiling, and then I knew this would be a sweet spot. 

Okay, yes, it's a little hipster with the faux old-fashioned themes to their cocktails. They love their whiskeys, and it shows when everyone orders a Manhattan with garnished with a lone, giant ice cube. You could feel thrifty and order the \"Codger\" as well, with a shot of who-knows-what and a can of Old Style for $5. The beer selection features quality IPAs, such as Modus Hoperandi from Ska Brewing. 

The bartenders have a bias toward bitter. I heart bitter, but I don't like whiskey. I saw a bit of tequila there too, but their selection doesn't appear too eclectic. 

In the back is a narrow room with shuffleboard, foosball...and even ski-ball! Oh gosh, I love that, even though after a few my balls might derail and ricochet elsewhere. :-x

Overall, this place is stylish, comfortable, and has a good selection. I especially like the huge, communal table in the center that looks like it would be perfect for beer pong. 

If they don't let me play, it's still cool. I'm gonna bring some friends here."}
{"text":"Little Woody is one of my favorite weeknight bars. (Yes, I'm the type of person that has several favorite weeknight bars)

As the name wood describe (pun) The Little Woody is both small and completely covered in wood - which gives it a unique, relaxing ambiance and a perfect setting for a few drinks, or more.

This place honestly has a seating area for about any mood.  The community-ish style tables in both the main bar as well as the game room can be a great way to meet new people from the neighborhood while the booths can provide enough seclusion for a quiet conversation or a date night.  That said, the pièce de résistance comes in the form of two Skeeball tables in the back of the game room.  I'll give you a minute to digest that.  Skeeball.

...

There's something delightfully nostalgic about playing skeeball at the Little Woody, and true to the PeterPiperPizzan sport that we all learned to love in our youth - these machines print out tickets if you achieve a high enough score. (The great part is that instead of exchanging tickets for worthless toys - at Woody they're redeemable for booze)

I truly believe that the Little Woody started (or at least popularized) a trend that will be replicated throughout the valley.  I'm a fan, and recommend you give it a shot."}
{"text":"Little Woody's is super cool.
Really, you feel like one of the cool kids here.  But not like football star lead cheerleader cool, no  no, little Woody's is too cool for that traditional type of cool.
No, first you feel speak easy cool.  Old school gangster cool.  Because there is no sign announcing the name of the place you feel in the know when you spot the big eyed owl gazing over the street and realize this is the place.  It's too cool for a name.  You enter through the back, which is the front, because the front has no entrance.  Cool, right?
Then its dark.  not seedy dark, but masculine and sultry dark.  Again, really cool.
Once you get your drinks you head over to the game room and a new kind of cool hits: nerd cool, gamer cool, arcade kid cool.
Shuffle board, skee ball (!), darts  and foosball are always exciting, and winning free beer with your insane skee ball skills is the coolest!
Didn't eat this time, but the chalk boards advertised some tasty looking options.  And their cocktails, while maybe a bit pricey, were super intriguing.  I stuck with beer on this occasion and it was frosty and quick.  Good night."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Arcadia. Drinks are priced appropriately and you can't beat the atmosphere. My boyfriend and I fell in love over the excitement of Skee Ball competitions. The front part of the bar is more relaxed and quiet but has board games available to keep the fun going. The back tends to be louder because of the darts, skee ball, shuffleboard, and foosball but is equally as fun."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Went in early on NYE and beat the crowd.  Service was excellent.  Most cocktails priced at $8, I thought that was pretty reasonable.  Can't wait to go back and try some of their food too.  So glad I found this little gem!"}
{"text":"The Little Woody has become my new favorite spot to hang out! I moved to the Arcadia area recently and my friend recommended it. Friendly staff, fun games, awesome crowd of people and great drinks. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while, so I finally stopped it with some friends for happy hour last night.

First, I really loved the atmosphere. It's dark, cozy, and kind of rustic feeling. One of my friends said \"I feel like we're in a cabin.\" It's perfect for relaxing for friends, and I think it would also make a great place for date night. The place is split in half with a bar in the middle, seating and tables on side, and then the games on the other. Although I didn't play any games this visit, I will definitely be back for that! They have shuffleboard, skee-ball and fooseball-how could you not like that?!

The drink menu had some great selections both beer and cocktail wise. I sampled my friend's Arizona Mule (aka a Moscow mule) and tried to order my own. Unfortunately, the bartender brought everyone else's drink but mine. I thought he was going to come back with it since his hands were full, but he didn't come back around for 15-20 minutes, so I ended up just getting a beer. The slow/forgetful service was kind of the theme of the night, but I'm pretty sure the bartender/waiter  was the only one working, so I don't want to be too hard on him.

The food we ordered was pretty good. I went with the turkey sandwich and thought it was flavorful, especially with the cranberry chutney. One of us ordered the grilled cheese, and it looked really good, evidenced by the fact that my friend that ordered it did not share with the rest of us. We also got an order of hummus and pita bread. The hummus was okay, but it was at least a generous serving.

Although I was disappointed by the service on this visit, I would like to try it again."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  Fun and games, great beer and food! Dart boards need to be better lit though....red lights...what???"}
{"text":"Not a fan of the little woody at all. The bar is extremely dark and has really low energy. The prices on the drinks aren't the greatest for the atmosphere and would only ever come here again for a work happy hour."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with some friends and had a great time.  Packed at 10pm on a Friday.  Great servers, vibe, and booze selection.   Had a few pours of bourbon here after hanging out at OHSO.   On a side note, I paid my tab at the end of the night, but must have dropped my card on the floor at some point.  Came back the next day and the card was safely secured.  See you soon Little Woody!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab drinks with friends and catch a game of skeeball."}
{"text":"Super cool little place! Walls have wood on them, the main entrance is a bar with a divey feel to it. There are two rooms on either side. One has pool and kind of a lounge area with dancing, and the other has darts, skee ball, shuffle board, etc. Moscow mules here are great when they give them to you in the copper mug. They taste unbelievable. Parking lot is typically pretty full is the only downfall."}
{"text":"Best dive bar in Phoenix! But don't tell anyone!!! Let's keep this our little secret."}
{"text":"Fun joint!   Its a hole in the wall with a fashionable twist.  The people who camer here the night I was there were hipsters who were more into caual and convo than a club or a dark sports bar.

People were pretty friendly (wish there had been more chill couches to hang ou t in) and loved the skee ball!!  Spent at least an hour playing- so cool to have it at the bar."}
{"text":"Great place.  Don't order the pretzel.  You are essentially paying $7 for a small roll."}
{"text":"Super cute bar with no signs so look for the owl!! Eric the bartender is awesome and so sweet!"}
{"text":"What a great little bar, this will be another Arcadia success story. However, I don't like having to leave my drink inside just to go for a smoke. A tiny patio in the back with a table or two for drinks would be fine."}
{"text":"Great small bar. Can get pretty packed on the weekend but worth it for their Alcoholic Salads! Flatbread was surprisingly good too."}
{"text":"Cozy, yet spacious dive bar that offers a good bit of variety. 
Wide selection of liquor as well as several options of beer on tap & in bottle. 

Three different rooms, one is for games, another for lounge & conversation, and the other for guest music performers. 

As far as I can remember the prices have been fair, the service is adequate, & the other patrons are generally polite. 

Most nights its crowded just enough to have a nice happening buzz about the place, but still roomy enough to find a seat after a short wait and get your drinks at the bar in a reasonable amount of time. 

If I'm ever in the area or have a good reason to go, I'm always happy to return to the little woody."}
{"text":"Drinks were incredible. Atmosphere was super cool. Really loved how mysterious it was from the outside.  Cool vibes all the way. Even thought about looping back after dinner for another yummy drink. Wish I could take this spot to jersey with me."}
{"text":"K: It's right there!
Me: Where?! 
K: There, you just passed it make a U turn and go back. ...No you just passed it..

We finally made it no thanks to my navigation skills, well this place is admittedly kind of hidden and unassuming from the street. That is fine with me , I would like to keep this little treasure my secret, now that I have found it.  
When you walk to the door you almost expect to do some sort of secret knock to get in.  
The vibe and ambiance can fit almost any occasion from a casual drink with friends, a romantic date night or a night out solo to belly up to the bar, make new friends and chat up the bartenders. 

The staff are friendly and attentive, their menu is simple but unique.  They have tempting pub food options worthy of a quality gastropub and offer a full-bar but I highly recommend trying any one of their signature drinks on the menu.  

I can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"Went here last night and It had been a while since I was here. Even with a full bar, Will crafted the most insanely delicious cocktails and never seemed bothered that I had such a tall order. If anything, he seemed excited to show his skill! The customer service was just off the charts and the drinks were amazing!! Even the crowd was really polite. Anyway, this place deserves a good Yelp review. I love it here."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, The Little Woody. Shenanigans abound here. During the week this is a great place to find a $5 draft (or even a $2 canned stout*). They make a mean Moscow Mule too. I've met some of the most interesting people here from all walks of life. (Note that the age range drops to more of a college crown late Friday/Saturday.) Yes, there is a hipster vibe with a plethora of guys wearing plaid. But who cares? It's fun here!

Bar service is available everywhere. No worry if you're not seated right by the bartender. The employees will hustle out to take orders. Alex is *freaking* hysterical. Ask for a demo of what he can do with a towel. The modest need not.

Try not to drive too fast for your first visit. The building is brown with a small-ish neon owl out front. From the back parking lot it's not really clear either if you've arrived. (Note: The parking lot is a very safe place to leave your car. Plenty of folks do as The Little Woody is keen to roll you into a cab. At closing cabs are lined up.) 

Be sure to scope out the back game room.  I had been going for more than a year before I realized there was even fun behind the bar. D'oh! 

* The Two Dollar Beer * 
Short story. They have a chalk board which usually lists the available beers. The other night I noticed a section for cans. Always on the lookout to try a new beer I said, \"I'll take the Vinifera thing.\" A stout is a close as I can get during the summer months to a porter, so Yes Please! 

When ferried to my table I plopped down a $5 bill as I thought it was $4. (Which is crazy bananas cheap.) My jaw dropped when three dollars were returned as change. Yup. If you're a fan of dark beers check try Vinifera Stout! (7.5%). It was like drinking chocolate. 

Right. So this is a great place!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  

The mixologists here are truly amazing!  I had the best Old Fashioned ever here.  Well, technically, I had TWO of the best Old Fashioneds ever here!  Made with Suntory Hibiki Whisky, this was the stuff that dreams are made of!  I will be back for more of this heavenly cocktail!

As far as the venue itself, The Little Woody is just a cool place to hang out and chat (as it's not too loud), look at beautiful people (there are many on most evenings), or play some billiards.  

I feel like they could use larger bathrooms to accommodate the number of patrons, but The Little Woody has a cool, hip, and fun vibe to it, so you expect a good size crowd.

*****FIVE STARS*****"}
{"text":"I would definitely not classify The Little Woody as a dive bar... what has replaced the former dive Great Escape is a very cozy drinking bar with a casual vibe. This is definitely the kind of place you could disappear for a few hours, or say an afternoon, and not know whether the sun is up or down as you stumble out the door and back into reality.

BOTTOM LINE: I've got a bar stool here. Already."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time with a group of 6 people for the start of a birthday celebration. This place is probably not the place you want to go with a large group of people, but they were very accommodating for us even though they were very busy. We just had a couple rounds of drinks here. I tried their Manhattan and a couple of their signature drinks...one was fairly good (I just had a sip because it was someone else's drink and then my drink the tongue in something or another...it was strawberry with cranberry and some other things...it was not my fave. Prices were a bit high, but I did enjoy the atmosphere of this bar. I would probably come back."}
{"text":"Really cool place. First time here and it was interesting. Fair prices and fun games. It gets a little crowed and if you're there to play games, you will be waiting a while. I understand you want as many people in there as possible, but it really degrades the experience. Maybe a Friday at 10PM is the wrong time to go if your looking to play pool and all the fun bar games. That is a small hiccup however as everyone there was really nice. The bartenders rocked! Fast and friendly, they remembered me right away, which is rare because I look like every white guy in the world!! Haha! 

Best way I can describe this place is like the Eric's basement off That 70's Show. It's got a upscale divey feel. Really cool spot."}
{"text":"We went on Valentine's Day.  I know, I know, I should have yelped while it was hot, but I've been busy!!

Anyway, it's nice.  They did some very cool things with such a small space!
They offer an eclectic menu of small munchables, they have some decent beer on tap, and they have created some lovely sounding signature drinks. 

There are a couple of downsides.   It is too dark in there to read the menu, and obviously it's not just us, since the bartender has a method (kinda cool)  for dealing with it.  
The second thing is that while the interior is sleek and interesting, it isn't cozy.  You may not know me, but I'm a boozer, and I wasn't moved to stay for a second drink.
I really want to like it since it is walking distance to my house and I will go back.  I just don't think I'm ever going to be a regular."}
{"text":"This place has sooooo many things working against it like it's location in Arcadia and it's clientele, they didn't have the popcorn machine from the great escape but somehow on a Sunday night it's a pretty cool place. It wasn't overly crowded and the amount of Arcadia/Scottsdale dbags was at a minimum. The staff was friendly and pretty funny, they have a good whiskey selection but are lacking in Irish whiskey and they could organize their whiskey menu better. It's an all around good time. It would be better if they could do food past ten, but whatever."}
{"text":"This place is a fun, enjoyable and a darn tootin good time!

We came here because it looked divey and was close to my friends pad. Can't beat that combo Bs!

We rocked out, getting reasonably priced drinks, playing darts and shooting skee ball. Sayyyy what?! Yes skee ball. We were trying to beat each other and I can now concede my skee ball title.

Hit this place up! Skee! Skee!"}
{"text":"Cool place. Stopped in for a quick drink with friends. I like the decor a lot - wooden log walls and high top seating as well as booths. Separate room with shuffle board and other bar games if that's your thing.

Drinks are reasonably priced and there's enough parking which isn't always the case in this area. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Nico was so friendly and informative. I really enjoyed not only the Peach Ale that I picked, but also the Blueberry Van that he suggested. This is an amazing spot for craft beer! We also went \"all in\" with the Charcuterie and Cheese and Fruit Platter. The toasted bread and cranberry chutney were perfect complements to the Brie, walnuts, grapes, and apples and more! It was easily the best cheese and meat plate that I have had. The rest of the menu looked delicious and I could have easily tried just about anything. My husband had the White Chocolate Ale which was also amazing. The decor was subtle yet fun and homey.  So glad that we drove a bit from our hotel to this cozy spot and would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Wow. Talk about a diamond in the rough. From the outside It looks like a seedy dive bar you wouldn't want to visit in the daylight. Ever. But WOW. This is NOT a dive bar. It's awesome. Great drinks, great music, great atmosphere, great setup. The inside is amazing. Great Service from the 3 or 4 people we interacted with. Try the drink called the Hardwood cause it was amazing. And bonus...Chelsea our server was ridiculously hot and was wearing maybe the best shirt I have ever seen. ;-)"}
{"text":"Cool hipster bar . I wish i wasn't older because this would be the place to hang. We felt too old so we didn't stick around . Really cool vibe and great music."}
{"text":"I've had this spot bookmarked for a while, it's like a little lost gem.  When I say little I really do mean LITTLE!  We drove past the building 3 times and eventually just had to follow the dot on the map to ask the valet  if we were in the right spot.  So, note to self: when you're on the prowl for this place just look for the little owl eyes...or maybe it's a woodpecker. :-p

I have only been twice, once on a Friday and then on a Saturday.  Both nights were completely packed.  It's quaint and a great crowd, a nice change from the Old Town Scottsdale scene.  They have tons of games in the back: foosball, skiball and something else I can't remember. ;)  

Something totally random that I noticed and thought was super cute, they give the checks back in these little black books.  Not sure why that was one of the things I liked most.

I'm sure at some point I'll venture back out this way, cab ride from here to Scottsdale isn't bad and the drinks aren't overpriced."}
{"text":"This was a cool dive bar with a speakeasy feel. The bar has a bit of a classy air to it, while the back room is filled with games and some oddities (think chairs with animal fur cushions and barrel tables). They have sour beer bombers for $10... That's a steal in my book!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal service. Amazing atmosphere. Small menu but perfect. The whiskey flights, hit the spot. All around, great place. Hard to spot off the road but once you find the owl, you're set."}
{"text":"Super cute little spot tucked away and almost hidden unless you know where you are looking. Thursday evening not too crowded and we loved hanging out in the back room with the skee-ball. The highly polished and absolutely gorgeous tall tables had us wondering where we could get a couple for our own house. But the cocktails were fantastic and the beer specials good. Service was quite good as well. I can't wait to stop in here again."}
{"text":"Arcadia's version of a dive bar.

It has intentionally subtle signage, and if you do not know where it is you will miss it. Look for the neon outline of an owl in the front window. A parking lot is in is the rear.

It is usually busy and attire is casual. It has a nice atmosphere, a combo small Midwest town bar meets hipster vibe. One of those places that you can go in either dressed up attire or in jeans and a t-shirt.

 The crowd in generally attractive and social. Traffic flow is poor due to layout of the bar. There is a back area with bar games."}
{"text":"The Little Woody is the trendiest dive bar in town.  Is that a good thing?  You can judge for yourself.  

The \"bouncer\" gave me a tip on when a chill crowd is there, but I won't be sharing that with you!  Of course, if you are like me, the time to go is NOT on weekends, when college students and arrogant twenty-somethings overtake the place.  

The coolest part about The Little Woody is they have Skeeball!  They also have Foosball and a couple other games, but Skeeball takes the cake.  

Of course, if you don't heed my warnings and you go on a weekend, there might be a blonde who drank far too much hogging Skeeball; she might try to start a fight with you and your friends when you try to play an empty lane.  When you make it clear you will not tolerate drunken shenanigans, she might go into hiding for awhile and then reemerge even more drunk.  Well, at least that's what happened the first time I was there.

Still, the place is pretty nifty.  

I'm not sure how much the drinks cost because, well, I'm a woman.  I don't think they could be too pricey, though, since I heard no complaints from my thrifty friends.

If you're one of those people who has to always do what the cool people are doing, go ahead and bookmark this one now.  ;)"}
{"text":"I loved this place. You could walk by it and not notice it at all. Has a speakeasy vibe that will have you asking yourself before you go in, \"Am I in the right place?\" Go in! A dark room with the pinkish/red light of the bar to greet you. Friendly staff. Great game rooms with a fantastic shuffleboard table (which is how we stumbled on this place while searching yelp). Table tops that are very cool cut slabs of trees. This is no sports bar dive. Classy and fun!"}
