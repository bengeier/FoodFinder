{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! When we first met with Dave I knew the experience would be great. You can't beat the prices and quality. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a pool here in Phoenix. Obviously with this climate a pool is a necessary, and He built me the most amazing custom pool. It has all features I asked for and their entire team was extremely informative and polite"}
{"text":"Dave Barrett of AAABAR Pools is one heck of a pool builder.  He was very helpful in designing my pool exactly like I wanted it.  He was there for every phase of construction ensuring everything was done correctly.  He used top quality products throughout and the system is completely automated through my phone.  He always returned my phone calls when I couldn't get in touch with him right away.  I received quotes from multiple companies and Dave's price was by far the best offer.  He also put in a built-in BBQ, Fire pit, pavers and artificial grass to finish off my previously desert landscaped yard.  We are 100% satisfied with his work and absolutely love our backyard.  My friends and family have also commented on well the work was done.  I would definitely recommend Dave at AAABAR Pools if you're looking to build a new pool."}
{"text":"So my family decided we wanted a pool in our new house. I did my research very thoroughly for such a large purchase of course. Was referred to other contractors and large builders. Called, emailed, etc. many builders. Had meetings with a few, some never called back or even got back to us after having met with them. Found aaabar through bbb with an A+ rating so looked more into it. Submitted an email inquiry from their website and within minutes received a call from Dave. Set up a time to meet and he showed up on time. Wife and I discussed what we wanted and we measured the yard and drew up some plans. We had a few more meetings scheduled with other builders and told Dave we would get back with him. After meeting with the other builders and fine tuning what my family wanted, we decided to let aaabar pools build ours. Dave said that now things are gonna get moving quickly, and he was right. He pulled permits very fast and a few days later he said we are gonna dig on Monday June 1st. So 2 days of digging, Wednesday was plumbing Thursday was steel, Saturday electrical. Then an inspection by city and then shotcrete. Then came tile and kool deck/ acrylic, fence, etc. All in all about 5 weeks from start to finish for the type of pool I wanted which is fast. But all trades used did a very good job. Dave showed up for every phase and went through with each crew what was going on. Dave also was in contact the whole time and filled us in with the next phase or just answered any questions I had. We have only had our pool complete for a few weeks and use it almost every day. Have a 3 and 4 yr old and they love it and want to be in it every chance they have. The finished product turned out better the we had envisioned. The pool is gorgeous and was made exactly the way we wanted. The process for how intense it is, was actually very smooth and pain free. Everyone who has seen it has been very impressed with how nice it looks. We have told everyone how happy we are and we whole heartedly recommend Dave and aaabar pools."}
{"text":"The owner, David Garrett, has the worst temper in the world!  

When we setup the first appointment to design and discuss the options, Garrett became mad because he saw our house was on sale!  He did not even discuss our options and prices.  He said since the house is on the market, it would not benefit him or me to build the pool at all!

We reminded him, independently of what we are doing with the house, he needs to do his job.  He packed up his things and left shortly after arriving. 

I explained to him we are either selling the home or building the pool, not both.  He did not even listen and left very angry.  

I was going to use this company to build our next pool, at the new home.  However, based on this treatment and behavior by the owner, this company is obviously not up for the job."}
{"text":"First pool experience:) started off with Shasta, then shopped around and met up with Dave from AAABAR. 
He beat competition price by several thousand, on a much larger pool. Signed a contract June 29, with the rain and 4th of July holiday I'm still already at pebble Tec. The major companies will tell you upfront 10-12 weeks start to finish if no issue like rain or permits problems. 
If you are looking for a BIG pool, built in a months time, at a great price......
Dave is your guy.

{"text":"Dave Barrett the owner and manager says bigger is better.  He always does what he says he will.  He built our pool. When we wanted to refinish it after several interviews Dave was still the guy with the most for the least cost.  We would and do recommend him to anyone who asks"}
{"text":"My husband called to make an appointment and the first impression wasn't great. The phone was answered like it was a cell phone rather than a business. We made an appointment any way and the guy never showed up or called to cancel with us. It's very unprofessional. When you're looking to spend a substantial amount of money on something, you want to feel reassured that you're going to get taken care of. Even if the company contacted us to apologize I wouldn't feel comfortable using them for such a large project."}
{"text":"I can't explain how happy my wife and I are with choosing Dave Barrett  of AAABAR pools.  Dave is absolutely wonderful.  If you have never had a pool built in the past you may not know how unreliable pool builders and contractors can be. Dave is the exact opposite. He is always on time, professional and overseas his contractors to make sure the work is of high quality. Our initial impression was extremely positive. He came out to the house and designed the pool on the spot. He also gave us a quote which was almost $20,000 less than Dolphin Pools. His subcontractors have been in the business almost thirty years and are extremely reliable. He's very quick with getting the work done. It has been only one month and our pool is almost entirely done which includes a fire pit, a massive Spa and 1200 square feet of decking."}
{"text":"Dave not only built us an amazing pool, but an entire backyard!  He sat down and was patient with us as we made various changes to our design.  After contract signing Dave started construction immediately.  Dave checked in with his Sub-contractors daily, and if he noticed something that didn't meet his high quality standards, he made them fix it.  Dave came over for coffee and a weekly project recap meeting almost every weekend.  Through the entire process he was extremely professional and an all around great guy.  If you want an amazing pool with a no-hassle experience, AAABAR Pools is your place."}
{"text":"Dave is an excellent pool builder. He truly sits down at the kitchen table and draws your pool and spa in front of you. He accepts feedback but isn't afraid to give recommendations. We changed our plan after the initial contract and Dave was very accommodating. He is on the job site all the time checking on his subcontractors. Everyone was an expert and polite from the excavation to the pool startup. Thanks again."}
{"text":"used Dave and AAABAR to build our pool in 2005. We stayed in that home for 11 years and never had an issue with the pool. He was substantially lower in price than anyone else we met with and built a much larger pool than anyone else quoted us on. When we ever decide on another pool we will certainly contact Dave again. Don't be afraid to use AAABAR for your pool."}
{"text":"What an awesome experience!   We just moved to Arizona and interviewd several pool contractors. Mr. Barrett had the best pool plan and the best price. He built the pool within 8 weeks from start to finish and i get to enjoy my beautiful pool just in time for the hot weather!! My husbandand i would highly revommend him."}
