{"text":"Had a great breakfast and mimoasas here this morning after camping up in Cave Creek. Smoked salmon platter hit the spot and our server was attentive and very polite. Enjoyed very much!"}
{"text":"This cafe had a rude waitress who greeted our group in a belittling disrespectful attitude.  We asked for separate checks and the tone increased with an attitude that she was not there to serve.  Told us to go elsewhere and get them to give individual tickets.  Pay$25.00 for a sandwich and maybe they will give tickets as requested.  She said she would have to work Alan extra hour to process individual tickets.  Our group left and went yo another restaurant nearby and had a very nice lunch and treated very nicely with all of the staff.  We will not return to this restaurant and will not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service with an easy atmosphere.  Sit outside on the patio and enjoy the mountain views. Located in the heart of Carefree near the largest sundial, the setting is calm and quiet. Small menu but you won't be disappointed in the food presentation or quality. The one thing they don't do is pancakes and would like to see them add that to the selection. We've tried most everything and haven't been disappointed."}
{"text":"I dream about the turkey sandwiches from this place. I have yet to find an equal and that includes Chicago (our primary city of residence). The turkey is always ultra fresh. On top of that, the bread sticks to the top of your mouth devouring each bite. Something I look for...however rarely find.

Another reason I love this place was after the 3rd day of dining in they had remembered our names and our orders which is always a testimony about the service/staff.

Establishment is very small, but really what do you expect from a lunch spot in Carefree on Easy Street? I enjoy the location and my wife loveees shopping at the strip mall after we finish eating. Oh, btw plenty of parking no matter what time you go.

The menu boast all kinds of sandwiches and salads...and even has a selection of beer on it. Something I didn't expect from a lunch place...esp. like this. 

We visit Carefree yearly for about a week and each time we do we get our daily lunch from the Sundial. This place rocks and we can't wait to come back. In addition, that translates into leaving the bitterness of Chicago for a mild Arizona one. Can't wait. See you soon!

Updated as of 3/23/10: Sandwiches still rock...just got back from AZ and had the pleasure of dining here again. Only reason for taking away the fifth star was the idea of a $12 sandwich with a regular portion of meat. Can't really justify spending that type of money for a deli sandwich. I translate that into simply paying The Boulders prices.

My sandwich starts at 7.99
add cheese                  1.00
add avocado                 2.00
Grand Total                  10.99  (ouch) tax not included.

Note: these were the only ingredients I added...you can add many others, but of course....for a nominal fee. 

I am in the wrong business."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I had a pastrami sandwich glazed with their special sauce. The sauce was forgettable and I don't recommend it. Served with a handful of dry potato chips. Wife had the French dip. Very ordinary. $11.00 each. No drinks.  I wouldn't go again, lots of other choices in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for breakfast and it was very disappointing. We both ordered the sample platter. It was a very skimpy sampler plate. The bacon was paper thin, French toast was very small. Definitely not worth 9.25. When I commented it to one of the waitresses, she shook her head, said \"no I don't think so\" and walked away. She was so rude! I was astonished. AVOID THIS RESTAURANT. Go to Black Mointain Cafe instead. You get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Visited here a short while back. We were the only people in the restaurant for lunch. That should have been a clue.  The wait staff was super nice and friendly. Sadly, he food was terrible. I ordered a taco salad and my friend ordered the French dip. The bread for the French dip was like doughy Wonder Bread with Swiss cheese on the meat. She didn't eat it. They got my order wrong so I sent it back. It was basically just iceberg lettuce with some mexican ingredients thrown on top.  A tasteless colorless mess.  Very disappointing. We live in Carefree and we're hoping for much more."}
{"text":"We have been to the Sundial Cafe several times in the last month and the food has been excellent. The breakfast burrito is the best I've ever had and the potatoes are light and flavorful. The strawberry is devine."}
{"text":"I came up to the Cave Creek/Carefree area today and while killing time I went into the Sundial Cafe for a coffee. It's a really simple little cafe, and there were only a few people dining so the service was prompt. The ladies in there are also very nice. Their menu is actually pretty extensive, they had some really yummy looking salads and big sandwich selection. While I was having coffee two different customers came in to pick up pies that they had ordered for thanksgiving, and another came in asking if they had extras, so i'm guessing they are pretty good!"}
{"text":"Ok, took 25 minutes so far to get seated and order food.  Well its Valentines day and a festival going on.  BUT, what we didn't like was charging  $2.50 to split a plate. Well they did give an extra side salad so that made me happy.  But still....for the prices, felt a tad high.  They are dog friendly which is a plus.  So not giving a high score or low, just middle of the road."}
{"text":"Nice for a standard breakfast - nothing too fancy. I had an onion, spinach and cheddar omelette that was delicious. Potatoes are nothing to write home about but still yummy."}
{"text":"Well, I really wanted to find a great place for lunch while in Carefree, AZ one day.....I guess I'll have to keep looking :(
It would have been nice if EITHER of the ladies working in the dining room seemed happy to see me. It would have been nice if I wasn't over-charged for a skimpy, wimpy BLT with not-so-fresh avocado and the crumbs from the bottom of the Lay's potato chip bag. It would have been nice if the other customers, at least, looked happy with their orders as they arrived or by the time they finished. 
But none of this happened on the day I visited. Bummer for me."}
{"text":"Visited the cafe for breakfast this morning, and had a pleasant breakfast. I had the breakfast burrito. There was a catch, an egg burrito with 3 ingredients of your choice. I had a hard time choosing as your average breakfast burrito has at the very minimum eggs, meat of some sort, cheese, various veggies and potatoes. Do I settled for cheddar cheese, sausage, and onions :/ (really, I had to choose cheese for an ingredient?). The food was good, and the staff was nice. Be sure to grab a mint on the way out, they're free!"}
{"text":"This cafe has a great location in Carefree, right across from the largest sundial in the world. It is also pet friendly. There are new owners taking over this place and will have a new menu. Unfortunately, they will no longer have the best French dip I ever tasted nor some of the more popular salads the old owners had served. Hopefully some of the old patrons will ask the new owners to reconsider and bring back some of the more popular items on the menu."}
{"text":"We tried a new spot this Sunday. The Sundial cafe is next to its namesake (The Sundial) in Carefree, AZ. Nice lil breakfast place hidden away. Good for the standard egg, bacon, sausage, home fries and toast breakfast. Nothing fancy, just good stuff. The ice tea (crystal clear, smooth and refreshing) was exceptional. Great outside patio too."}
{"text":"I've had lunch here twice now.  Both were very good.  The salads are big and satisfying.  The service was great; prompt with a smile.  The extra carafe of beverage is a fun treat and sitting outside on the patio is just yummy!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Went with my wife for their reservations only Chefs choice 4 course meal. Everything was truly phenomenal. Prosciutto wrapped Scallops were amazing, the lemon rice and orange sauce were epic.  

The bison was delicious, and I was truly a little nervous never having tried it before. Berry red wine sauce was delicious and excellent paired with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. The salad, served after the meal(traditional in France, or so my wife told me) was fresh, crisp and all the flavors really popped. The Creme Brulee finished everything off nicely. 

Truly excellent meal all around. Great service, and the live music was excellent.  Even got a dance with my wife in on the musicians last song. Wonderful food, service and environment.  Not an experience or meal I will forget anytime soon.  Definitely in for the next time around thru have the four course menu and anxious to try their regular menu for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped for a relaxing breakfast on a Saturday morning. The eggs Benedict were cooked perfectly, French toast was awesome and even the cup of fresh fruit tasty & perfect. Relaxed on the patio with amazing coffee and great service. New owners stopped by our table & introduced themselves. Will make this a frequent weekend stop!"}
{"text":"Turkey sandwich was great and the chili was fantastic. Service was fast and nice people that work here. I'll definitely be coming here again!!"}
{"text":"Where to begin? Just stopped in for a quick lunch and ordered a hamburger. They call it an Angus burger for $10.50, so I expected a great  burger. What I got was a frozen patty ( pretty sure it was from Costco since I had just made them a few nights ago ) that was overlooked and dry, along with some potato chips and a pickle spear. Along with a $3 coke, with tax and tip it was over $18. How am I expected to frequent this place? Someone needs to rethink their offerings."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and had a great chef salad with fresh ingredients and large portion.  My wife had the French onion soup and loved it.  Very friendly!"}
{"text":"Menu looked fabulous and other clients food look spectacular,  only  had a beverage not enough te to eat.  Will definitely come back for a meal.
Staff was great and friendly."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, service, and food are great. However the over abundance of awful 80's love music was enough to upset my stomach. If Olivia Newton John, Whitney Houston and Air Supply is your \"go-to\" music genre, this place is perfect.  We'll be back but wearing headphones."}
{"text":"I enjoy the cafe for lunch with girlfriends - the patio has ample seating and is covered, so there's plenty of shade.  The menu is great - my favorite is the Cafe Sandwich... yum!  The servers are always pleasant and the service is fast.  I would recommend this restaurant for lunch to anyone visiting or heading over to Carefree."}
