{"text":"I tried Hot Bunzz at FNL at the ROM. The surf and turf bun was amazing. There was a good amount of lobster on top and steak inside the bun. Both lobster and steak were flavourful and the lobster was creamy and buttery. The bun itself was soft and not dry. It cost 1 ROM buck or $6 for 1 bun, which is about the size of a Tim Horton's donut. I'm not sure if it's worth $6, but I do recommend it if you want to try."}
{"text":"Wandered in thinking it was still Bacon Nation (horrible signage) and was greeted by a kid who was helpful in describing the confusing and over ambitious menu filled with ill advised hybrid toppings, meagerly stuffed in a subpar bun. The beef buns tasted like dog food. The chicken buns were a bit tastier but all these buns are overwhelmed by choices of sauces and toppings seemingly chosen by throwing a dart at a map. This place seriously lacks an identity and I can't see it lasting much longer with all the better and cheeper options available all around this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I saw the BlogTO feature on the Family Day weekend and immediately shared it with the wifey on FB. She was just as excited as I was to go check it out after our afternoon family outing but when we arrived for lunch they were closed. This is an important part of the review because you should definitely call ahead, especially on the weekend. according to the owner (I think he was the owner) they are still settling in and because it's the winter, business is slower during weekends (Take note crybaby restaurants on King St, but I'll digress on that one)... Anyways, I managed to make it down tonight and it was definitely worth the wait. The menu was pretty big but the owner was super cool and helpful... a really really nice guy, I must say!   I went with 3 of the smaller street buns... beef, jerk chicken and butter chicken. The beef was surprisingly not as good as the chicken ones and I don't think I'd get it again but the other 2 were really really good. I will definitely be back and I look forward to trying the larger, \"more gourmet\" buns and the sides, which looked incredible too.   The presentation is great, the location is excellent and the owner is super cool! 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Stop #3 at the Canadian National Exhibition is Hot Bunzz Street Cuisine.  From what I can tell, Hot Bunzz serves up nothing but buns but with creative twists that make for the most easily transportable street food around.  I grabbed myself one of their Sexxy Surf N' Turf buns. Now before we delve into my opinion, let me say that this is the only item that I've tried at Hot Bunzz. I can totally see how the rest of their menu has the potential to be pretty good, considering the plusses that this bun had, so chill out anyone who likes this place. Right now I am not one of these people. At the time, I summarized the bun as \"offensive\". When you're served the bun you'll see that it's covered in the appealing looking shrimp salad, featuring diced tomato, sesame seeds, and poppy seeds. After taking a bite I was swiftly thrown by the weirdly zesty shrimp salad, that inexplicably tasted like Sprite. I then got a bit of the brioche bun pastry itself, which was hands down the best part. Think of a restaurant quality Hot Pocket with fresh ingredients. Once I got passed the pastry, I was brought right back to not caring for the bun as I got a bit of the beef. It just didn't sit well with the shrimp salad.  Despite how pretty this guy looks, I was disappointed and a little repulsed, (and I ate fried insects earlier that day). Again, I can fully see how different toppings with the great bun pastry could make the rest of the restaurant items fantastic, so hold on before you fix your fingers to type in protest. I just didn't jive with this."}
{"text":"Amazing street style food with equally amazing staff. The Sexxy Bunzz and super filling on their owe but they sides are so good, even if you can't finish them you'll want to have them. The Street Bunzz are smaller but they don't miss out on great flavour."}
{"text":"Yummy, cheap, and different take on buns! I had the jerk chicken street bun which was tasty (and more like a snack size). The lady working was very nice and helpful with recommendations from the menu. The Seoul City pulled beef is supposed to be good but they were sold out when I went, will have to go back and try it."}
{"text":"Really great vegetarian options. Would recommend the falafel bun and the salad, as it was surprisingly delicious.  The tax inclusive menu, solid portion sizes and great price makes this an awesome lunch spot on Queen West, will definitely return."}
{"text":"Gave this a try at this years Ex. I had the Juicy Oink combo with chips.   This is basically a sesame seed hamburger bun with a depression in the middle as the base. Its then topped off with various fillings.  The Oink had a tablespoon of pulled pork topped off with a small pork dumpling. I dug deep to try and find any sign of pork belly or pork skin (as advertised) but couldn't see or taste any. More bun than ingredients. Virtually impossible to eat as 'street food' without loosing what little filling there is onto the sidewalk.  Overall taste was uninspiring.   Sadly the prepackaged chips tasted better."}
{"text":"Hot Bunzz wasn't packed at all when I went to grab my pickup order. There was no line to begin with, but I can say that this place is a good place to eat when you're on a budget.  Personally, I didn't find the Bunzz that amazing but I found the sides were great. Bunzz were a 3/5 and the sides were a 5/5.  The sides that I had were: Lemongrass Pork Balls: These were really good to eat but after a little bit they became a bit hard on the sides. The center is nice and tasty!  Street Fries: These were my favourite part of the meal - these fries were really tasty and you should definitely get this if you come here.  Cheezzy Smashed Roots: The only good part about this was the Longanisa on top, everything else was not that great.  The Bunzz that I had were Bacon Butter Chicken, Seoul City Pulled Beef, and Texas BBQ Pulled Pork. I'm not going to be able to split up my review on a per-Bunzz basis because I had no idea which one I was eating.  These Bunzz were okay, but for how much I ended up paying for each of the Bunzz, it wasn't really a steal. I would rather a Big Mac over a Bunzz; and they're around the same price - hence the 3/5 for the Bunzz."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place, and I'm sure happy I did  The flavour combinations are amazing!!  Can't wait to taste all of the buns :)"}
{"text":"Never heard of this stuff but it was such a tasty lil snack! I got the Seoul City Pulled Beef and the Bacon Butter Chicken. The bun was nice and crispy, with hot fillings inside. I loved how they used the kimchi puree instead of actually kimchi since it just married the flavors nicely. I expected the bacon butter chicken to be a bit more savoury and curry-like but I think because of the maple bacon topping it was a bit sweeter but still super yummy.   All the buns come with a side of chips and dried apple chips too.  Would definitely stop by the Spadina location again!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend @ the CNE and tried the Juicy Oink from Hot Bunzz. The Juicy Oink is a bun stuffed with  pork cooked five different ways: 5 spice pork belly,  pork skin,  pork dumpling, longanisa,   pork shoulder  all topped with  a slaw . The Juicy Oink  was hot and tender . I  felt it that it was  good dish to try considering   that we were getting  five different things in one Every bite was delicious and I felt  satisfied having enjoyed  compared to many individuals who eat to  stuff themselves,  . Ill shall  add Hot Bunnz to my bookmarks for  a future visit  at their regular location to try some of the items  they sell with  BIson, Boar & Elk in them  ."}
{"text":"we stopped in at hot bunzz after seeing a narcity video and our expectations were exceeded!!! The staff are so chill and unpretentious, they were kind enough to offer us a sample of their mashed potatoes because we had to wait a little bit for our meal. The food was so good and the combos are reasonable, I recommend the street buns combos!"}
