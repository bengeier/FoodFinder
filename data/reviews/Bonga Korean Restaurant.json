{"text":"Excellent Gam Ja Tang and dduk bok ggi  We are from LA  USA and had our share of Korean food but we rate this Korean food as good as any Korean restaurants in LA.  Loved the quality and the cook!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and no one came to seat us. I saw a guy working back behind the curtain, and he saw me as well. My uncle and I decided to seat ourselves, and still waited. The open sign was on and the time was 11:23 a.m.  I got up to make eye contact again with the guy in the kitchen area. I asked if they were open (Awkward), anyways he went to another part of the restaurant and then an older lady came out and brought us tea and menus. We ordered two beef bulgogi bento boxes, and to start they give you some Korean Banchan. (Small dishes like kimchee, pickled daikon etc. The Bento box comes with a small cabbage salad, rice, bulgogi, two small springrolls. The food came out really quickly, which led me to believe that nothing was made fresh.  The bulgogi and rice plus salad were all made ahead of time that's for certain. The only thing that was made fresh was the two mini springrolls.  The space itself is located up a few flights of stairs, and no elevator access. If you have mobility issues, I'd skip this place all together. To be honest there are a lot of better options for Korean food. Macleod Trail and 17th ave. both have better fresher food. They do give you a ticket to fill out for a draw for Chinese New Years at the moment. 1st prize is a 65\" Samsung Television. 2nd is  a $100. gift certificate for the restaurant itself.  3rd prize $50 certificate.  I probably won't be back here for Korean. Nothing really wowed me here at all. It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't anything to write home about lol.  Just Yelp About !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Once in awhile I visit Calgary for work. When I do, I always walk to Chinatown and eat at Bonga! I love their fried chicken so much! And at lunch time, it is really affordable! I've also been there for dinner and we enjoyed everything - soup, fried chicken and bulgogi. The place doesn't look that great (minus one star), but you get tons of food and it is delicious! I am craving the chicken just writing this."}
{"text":"The food is really really good!! I just about come here biweekly because the food and service is amazing. The service is one of the best!"}
{"text":"This place was open on Christmas Day and the place was packed! They were short handed on wait staff but still provided excellent service. Food was awesome, we had a party of 8 and ordered Combo B for 6 and had to take 3 dishes back home. The fried chicken wings were delicious with a light but tasty batter."}
{"text":"The food and service were both amazing. Delicious food. I'll be back... maybe every week. Yum."}
{"text":"I'd give Bon-Ga 4.5 but definitely tilts toward 5.  What can I say? My wife and I think this is our 2nd favourite restaurant Calgary (South Indian style 'Raj Palace' in Harvest Hills near the northern T&T is first, and Pure Vietnamese Kitchen on 8th Ave downtown a tie).  The owners at Bon-ga are just wonderful: the husband speaks fairly good English and knows how to coordinate things well, and is flexible in trying to please patrons' special requests; his wife is the chef, and she's got some great recipes in her head. The food. All of it is good, but we tend to order two dishes over and over again: gumjatang (pork backbone & potato soup), and sizzling spicy squid & pork.  Gumjatang has a very distinct flavour that likely isn't matched by any other dish on the planet. It's also a favourite of the owners when they and their staff sit down for lunch mid-afternoon. The spicy dish has a flavour that would be hard to duplicate, but it's simply delicious. The squid is nicely sliced and tender, the veggies are varied and plentiful, and the pork always tender thin strips. But the flavour! Wow.   Oddly enough, when we swap sauces for our small rice bowls and trade meat and veggies, they seem to complement each other despite being flavoured so differently. Copy us if you want...  The appetizers are many (about 5-8 is customary), always fresh and nice cross-section of variously flavoured veggies, strips of flavoured tofu, nicely-chewy seaweed, excellent kimchi, delicious sprouts, and such. So much nutrition in them alone! A mild Korean tea comes with the meal(s), and after 2 years, the service and food has held up wonderfully well.  Go there, and experiment with the unique flavours of 'good' Korean food but I'd suggest you stick with the core dishes, and stay away from the bento boxes and the lunch specials that tend to be much less impressive, as they try to cover too much ground and don't satisfy for whatever reason.  Just like in other cuisines and countries, there are the many dogs, and then standouts like Bon-ga. Enjoy."}
{"text":"My favorite Korean place was closed today. So my friend and i decide to go to this restaurant to try something new. Personally i would never go back. The Gimbap lacks flavours. If you want good Gimbap go to So Yummy Factory. The bento box my friend has was cold even the spring roll."}
{"text":"I came here because I saw a sign at the front which advertised $10.50 & up lunch bento boxes., with a picture of a la galbi (short ribs) bento.  Imagine my disappointment when the item is no longer available, and the cheapest bento is actually $11.95.  While I understand that food prices have gone up, I do feel they need to update their sign as it's kind of false advertising.  Pushing that aside, the food was pretty decent, the staff are very nice and friendly and actually refilled our banchan (pickled daikon, kimchi and marinated bean sprouts) free of charge.  I wouldn't mind returning to try their grilled meats."}
{"text":"Very quick and very friendly service.  Comparable to Korean Village quality.  Recommend pork bone soup and bulgogi beef ribs. Will come back."}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 star. Tried this hole in the wall 3 times now.   The food is relatively good quality.   I wouldn't call it gourmet Korean but is more like comfort food level. Tried the LA ribs, bulgogi, seafood pancake, bimbimbap.  All were good but not exceptional. The stone pot for the bimbimbap is not always heated thoroughly enough so that the first time we had it, the rice was kind of mushy.  The kimchi appetizers are a bit sparse as only a selection of three but adequate.  Usually just sprouts, pickled daikon, and Kim chi.  Although we had the honey potatoes the last time. Will need to try the hotpots as it seems like lots of customers order it.  Looks good. Owner guy is really nice.  And service is better than typical Korean restaurants.  They have a little call bell system which helps a lot.  The owner helped identify where there were egg or milk concerns (watch the KFC as they marinate it in milk powder before frying) also. Prices are similar higher end Asian pricing compared to Chinese or Vietnamese.  Standard Korean pricing."}
{"text":"My buddy and I stopped by for lunch. We chatted with the owner, Sunny, who explained the menu and the ingredients and made some suggestions based on our knowledge/experience eating Korean food (which is none). He suggested that we try the stone bowl or the pork bone soup. We ended up ordering the pork bone soup for three.   For $30, this would a great deal for three people. We were so stuffed. Sunny explained how to eat the hot pot, instructing us how long to wait for the broth to boil. He also warned us eating the hotpot would be messy.   The pork was so tender. The broth was killer, though next time I'll ask for more spice. Our hotpot wasn't spicy because Sunny wasn't sure if we would like it. Lots of green onions, a few potatoes and kimchi were intermingled with the generous amounts of pork.   Five stars for service. My buddy and I can't wait to return to try the stone bowl, seafood pancake and the beef broth hotpot."}
{"text":"The food here is really good, owner and the staffs were very friendly. The portions of the food is huge. I recommend the pork bone soup, very good."}
{"text":"We decided to come here on a weekday lunch to try out this place. It wasn't a full house so luckily we were able to get a table with no problem. Because it was such a cold day, most of us decided to order a hot stew (though they do have bento lunch boxes!). I settled for my favourite spicy tofu stew. My stew was served at the right temperature (hot but edible) and was very flavourful. My friends who got the gamjatang stew, kimchi stew and beef bulgogi were all satisfied with their orders as well and stated that they would like to return to try other menu items. (They also have Korean fried chicken on their menu along with the regular Korean cooked dishes!). We were in and out in an hour, perfect for a step away from the office.  The owner was very attentive and friendly; he came by to refill our side dishes before our main dishes arrived and returned several more times throughout our stay to make sure we were doing okay. I would definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Swung by for lunch since I was in the Chinatown area.  Ordered their Super Bento for $13.90 before GST.  The bento box comes with banchan (fried honey potatoes, kimchi, bean sprouts, radish) and a bowl of miso soup.  Complimentary tea served on the side.  First off, this thing is a lot of food and a pretty good value even in Chinatown.  However, it isn't going to knock your socks off.  Starting from the top left and going clockwise.  Spring rolls were oddly shaped and probably the worse I have tasted in Calgary.  I love spring rolls but these were bad.  Something was off with the filling and the wrapper. Seafood pancake was hot and crispy, very good.  Didn't detect much seafood but I liked it alot. The short ribs and bulgolgi were ok.  Texture on the short rib was a bit too soft/mushy, bulgolgi was just average.  Should've been heated a bit more. Spicy squid was also ok.  Good spice, a few pieces of squid and some veg.  Also could've been reheated more. Japchae noodles were ok.  Also needed to be warmed more, the noodles were a bit harder then I prefer. Fried chicken.  Now this was the star of the bento.  Nice and crispy, light batter, juicy and tender chicken.  Only knock on this was it needed a sauce of some kind. I liked the kimbap, it was nice and tasty.  Quick dip in the sauce and you're golden.  Overall, good value.  Don't order this unless you're hungry.  Consider getting fried chicken as your main or side dish."}
{"text":"So went on Yelp to look for food and I came across this place. It has 4 stars rating and I decided to give it a try. The place is located inside Chinatown and you have to walk upstairs. Its really ghetto in terms of the décor. The owner is really nice. His service was not bad.   I ordered a bulgogi with rice and miso soup. It was ok. I find the bulgogi a bit too watery. I had it where it was a bit dryer and way more tastier in terms of flavor. Portion size isn't like huge. The sweet potatoes tasted like it was made with syrup or something. Seems like Vancouver Korean food makes better sweet potatoes.   The restaurant was very empty during dinner time."}
{"text":"This has become a favouite China Town lunch spot for us. Excellent service, extremely clean and tidy restaurant, great menu variety and the food comes out quick and fresh. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place came on the urgent recommendation of fellow yelper and Asian food connoisseur Bruce K. I mistakenly told him I'd been here before- nope. I'd never even noticed it, got it confused with another Korean joint in Chinatown. Decided to throw them a bone today (Sunday May 27 2018) and was blown away- AM blown away as I'm sitting in the resto as I type this on my phone. I got one of my standbys, spicy pork with cabbage. Always enjoy this, but this one was exceptional. Amazingly deep flavours, and everything is cooked and seasoned deftly, even the complimentary banchan is special. I'll leave it at that for now because I hate composing reviews on my phone but had to get this out ASAP. Go here."}
{"text":"Side dishes are relatively limited (potatoes, kimchi, and bean sprouts). We had soft tofu stew and bibimbap; both portions were very generous. The bibimbap didn't have a ton of flavour (I got the spicy sauce; they also have a soy sauce version) but it was still tasty. The soft tofu stew had a ton of tofu, which could be good or bad depending on how much you love tofu. It seems that their fried chicken is a specialty since everybody else seemed to be ordering it and they advertise it. Overall I wouldn't call it my favourite place to get Korean food in Calgary but it's still pretty good!"}
{"text":"We came from New York to visit our family. We were surprised by this restaurant: this place is as good as the restaurants in Flushing. The bibimpap was excellent, as was the soft tofu stew. We also ordered the Gam-ja Tang hot pot, and we really enjoyed it. The owner is Korean and the experience is very authentic. Very friendly staff. This place is different from the usual Korean restaurant that serves BBQ."}
{"text":"We happened to park on the block of this restaurant after having lunch in Chinatown, so I saw their sidewalk board for their lunch specials. It was slightly pass their lunchtime, but he let me order the kimbap at the lunch price to go. Since I wasn't hungry I wanted to order the half order on the menu but the owner said that's only for dining in so I got the full order. I tried a kimbap right away and it was ok; the rice was hard. I was also tempted to get their zazangmyun but was too full from having lunch already."}
{"text":"Ate there with 4 friends yesterday and it was really delicious! We ordered so much food!  Bibimbap, squid and pork belly bulgogi, 1 1/2 fried chicken, spicy pork bone hotpot with veggies and potatoes and stir fried rice cake. Included were also 3 side dishes that got refilled 3x! Highly recommend the bulgogi and the fried chicken! The owner is also suuuuper nice. Would visit there again!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Korean food in Chinatown! Stopped by with a few friends on a weeknight, relatively busy considering the cold. Bonga located right above Dessert House in Chinatown has some of the best service I've experienced in a while. Not a single time did we have to ask for anything such as tea or more side dishes. The staff was super attentive without being overbearing  The food was good but nothing extraordinary, maybe it was because the spicy Korean chicken being touted as \"3 chillis/super spicy\" was mildly tangy and with a hint of hot sauce. Otherwise a great meal with good flavours. Happy munching!!  Ordered 1. Tteokbokki (spicy korean rice cake) 2. Beef bulgogi  3. Seafood pancake 4. Kimchi stew 5. Half order of korean fried chicken (seasoned and spicy) - was not as spicy as it sound"}
{"text":"I got the beef bibimbap, which was pretty tasty and well portioned. Prices were fair. The inside is that of a typical family-run restaurant, but they have those buttons you can press to call for service too which I like a lot. They give you several complimentary side dishes as well, all of which were pretty good. No complaints about this place, but it wasn't outstanding either."}
{"text":"I love their boneless chicken. Served fresh and crispy and flavourful. Would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I like Bonga Korean!  From the moment we got to the restaurant, we had the best customer service in any restaurant we've ever been to!    We sat in a comfy booth. Menus were brought right away.  Green tea was promptly brought to the table. A trio of Banchan came to the table - bean sprouts, Kim chee, & Sweet Potatoes Tempura. Once we finished it, it was filled 2 more times without us asking for refills!!  What service!   We ordered the following: - Earthen Pot Bulgogi Bibimbap - hot stone bowl with rice, beef, vege and fried egg.  Eat with hot bean sauce.  Very tasty and piping hot! - Soft Tofu Stew - soft tofu, seafood,  poached egg, spicy soup with vege.  Comes with rice.  Spicy and delicious. - Soybean Paste Stew - stew made with soybean paste, seafood, tofu and vege.  Comes with rice.  This soup is not spicy but I did ask for a side hot sauce anyway.  Anything is good with hot sauce.   - Seafood Pancake - Pancake with green onion and seafood - looks like a pizza!  I liked the \"Pajeon\"; make sure you dip with the sauce that comes with it.  Of course, hot sauce also goes really well with the pancakes.  We'll be back!  Love Bonga!!!"}
