{"text":"Always a stop for me and my friends when we go out bar hopping....nice place with a dj on fridays and saturdays, alot of friendly people in the late 20\"s early 30's that usually patron the bar. Has a patio out front and one on the side, looks small when you enter but has a larger sitting area in the back with a fireplace. Drinks are priced pretty good ...nice chill vibe here."}
{"text":"We asked the waitress for salt and she said she cant give us salt because they only have one salt shaker that Bartender was using it. !!!!"}
{"text":"It might be a good bar for night, but it's not a good brunch place.

$4.50 for a latte that wasn't even a latte! Lattes are made with espresso, this was made with the weakest coffee I had ever tasted (including my mother's coffee). It was barely brown water. Steamed milk and coffee is a cafe au lait, not a latte. And not even Starbucks charges $4.50 for a venti latte and the latte they gave me was no where near that large.

Lovely people. Good service. But they really need to rethink their coffee and prices."}
{"text":"It was a quiet for a glass or two of wine and the ambiance was perfect.  A great bank of Windows to watch the street.  Mostly the company was great.  Great Bartender too ."}
