{"text":"I have eaten take out and delivery from this restaurant before.  The previous meals were good.  However, tonight I ordered a cheesesteak and tiramasu to be delivered.  The cheesesteak was cold, the fries were undercooked and cold and the tiramasu was bordering on being frozen.  The only item I ordered that should have been cold, a 2 liter bottle of soda, was warm.  The delivery person was not friendly at all.  I'm disappointed.  The first two times I ate here the food was good, it has definitely gone down hill."}
{"text":"This place is great! We ordered for pick up, and when we got there I was pleasantly greeted by the female bartender. She took me over to the restaurant side to pick up the food. The chef was super friendly and helped me carry the food to the car.  Now to the food; the antipasto salad was fantastic. It had copious amounts of fresh ingredients.  The calzones were also very delicious, I really like the dough they use, and they were full of toppings.  Overall, we really enjoy the food, and would recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"We had the calamari and it was cooked perfectly. I highly suggest ordering it.
The chef opened the restaurant for us before dinner and invited us over after telling us the neighboring restaurant closed last week.
We had the bolognese which was on point, a pizza, and carbonara which I asked for off the menu.
The pizza was thin crust and very tasty. The carbonara was great and hopefully they will add it to the menu for more to try.

Price range was around $20 per plate and we had plenty of leftovers after sharing.
The owner also sat down and spoke with us for a bit then gave us a few samples of their desserts."}
{"text":"Had food delivered to my home, and I must that its possibly the best Italian food in Vegas! I plan on paying a visit to this establishment to see if the service is the same."}
{"text":"Have been coming her for awhile and never a complaint until tonight. Todd ordered a sicilian pizza and I ordered chicken Daniel (breast of chicken with spinach, mushrooms and sundried tomatoes with potatoes) minus the sundried tomatoes. Waitress came back and said no sicilian dough would use regular...to a happy as a clam, could eat pizza every day guy, he was like ok...so food comes out and mine is cold and has what looks like frozen veggies (broccoli, carrots, cauliflower), no potato...so I send it back and waitress apologizes and says oh we were trying out new veg...um did u think to ask me if that was ok? Brings me a new one (after the owner and cooks refer to the menu) and the chicken was nasty slimy and well I am done...thank you..I am fighting Stage IV cancer and can not afford to eat under cooked chicken and get sick!
So Daniel the owner comes by the table and apologized and I say I usually get this or the Chicken Marsala and he proceeds to argue with me that the Daniel is a brand new dish...then blamed the waitress that she did not ask if I wanted option 1 or 2 (no options on said menu) he then threw down two cards for a glass of free house wine (we don't drink) and gave us back our coupon...
Not the way we planned to celebrate our Anniversary and a long way from the deliciousness we had last year on our Anniversary."}
{"text":"Love this place! If you are looking for some good homemade grandma's ITALIAN recipes make sure you dine here. The owner is always welcoming and attentive."}
{"text":"Where do I start!! This place is awful!! Service was very inconsistent, it took 45 min for our appetizer to arrive,which was sub par. It wasn't even busy just 3 tables occupied. 
I got the meatball and potato wedges and the wedges weren't cooked all the way through, and the burned the shit out of the garlic in my meatballs which left a bad taste in my mouth. Oh yea!! The owner parks his Ferrari right on the sidewalk out front the restaurant. Who does that? There was also a drunk cop with his wife who kept saying how good the food was. It was like a scene from a bad dream. They comped both our meals as we were leaving the owner was out front talking to the drunk cop about his Ferrari. Obviously this guy is in la la land, maybe you should sell the Ferrari and learn how to run a restaurant. Food is bad, waitress was sweet, but I'm not going back. I'am not exaggerating one bit. This place must be losing money everyday. Stay Away I warned you!!!!"}
{"text":"We just moved to anthem and have been looking for a good Italian place! When we first arrived the waitress said sit where you would like....all but a 1 big table in the bar were dirty (there was 2 of us) then after sitting for 5 min I got up to ask for menus. The waitress was nice and apologized, we ordered our drinks and she took the order after about 15 min later she comes to our table explaining that they were short a cook...( I understand this because I've worked in the food service before) but, when I asked if we could have some bread while we waited she said they had burnt it and more was being made...we decided to leave because we had already been there at least 35-40 min and didn't see salad, or bread even coming soon. Kinda bummed because it did smell great in there! Maybe, it was just a bad night. I would maybe try again but once a place leaves a bad impression on my husband it's hard to get him back:("}
{"text":"Strolling up to the door, the first thing that caught my eye on a saturday night was an empty parking lot.  The lot was empty for a reason!!!  Food was TERRIBLE!!!!!!!! Service was worse!!!!!  Owner was more concerned about his gaudy sports car parked in front of the door than he was with his customers.  Do yourself a favor and even if the meal is free don't go!  You'll be stopping at in and out after you leave.  Come on.....what type of italian joint reheats pasta????  DONT GO!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is terrible
Price for food is terrible.
Owner who argues over a groupon with customers, terrible.

I think this restaraunt may be on it's way to going out of business.

I had heard that the food was great several months ago, but what I think now is that the food USED TO BE great.

I ordered the $19.00 chicken marsala.  The chicken was like rubber, very thin small portion and the sauce was more like gravy and had very little taste to it.
The side vegetable was a lump of spinach, and the potato was a wedge of a potato.
The owner was sitting at a table with an overdressed couple and  once they left, the owner went over to a table to argue with another couple that tried to use their groupon, and were told that he no longer excepted the groupons. 


I called my friend who had recommended this place to make sure I was at the right place, and she said she had also recommended this place to others, and I was the 3rd person who told her the food was terrible.

It was a bummer to have chosen this place for my birthday dinner, I was sorry I went."}
{"text":"A nice location and pleasant atmosphere. Service started very well, but went downhill fast. 

We started both appetizer specials of the day.  

The first - deep fried meatballs - was okay; nothing to write home about. We later added them to our entrees, and they felt like they belonged better there. 

The second - a selection of 2 each of their popular appetizers -was a mixed bag. Fried mozarella sticks and fried ravioli were both tasty.  Calamari was soggy and limp. The real problem was the shared dipping sauce which was just plain bland and boring. Adding crushed chili peppers gave it a bit of a bite, but it was still a losing cause. Squirting fresh lemon on the calamari did nothing to help the taste and just made them soggier. . 

The main course was spaghetti bolognese (we asked, and they substituted fettuccine) and this dish was just adequate.  It felt like they had added too much cream to the red sauce, and it was smooth and orange, instead of lumpy and bright red. I hate to say this, but the bolognese sauce at even the Olive Garden is much better. After we'd started eating, the waitress came over and apologized that she had forgotten to bring us our salad.  She offered to pack it to go, but we declined.  

After we'd finished, we just waited and waited and waited.  We piled our dirty dishes in an effort to neaten our table, but no one approached us to clear the dishes, offer us dessert or coffee.  The restaurant was not particularly busy and we could see the two waitresses standing in the kitchen watching the cooks at work.  About 20 mins after we had finished, we were finally able to catch the attention of the maitre d' who finally summoned one of the waitresses for us.

Terrible service notwithstanding, the food itself was simply too bland and boring to consider giving this place another chance. A pizza being carried to another table looked tempting, but not enough to warrant another roll of the dice."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, especially in the bar.  Best kept secret in Henderson!  We will definitely be back Again!  The Lasagna was excellent!"}
{"text":"We took my sister in law here for her birthday dinner which was a risky since none of us had been here or really heard anything about this place.  Luckily it was a hit with everyone and we all loved our meals.  Service was great too, we had a very personable waitress.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Being from upstate NY and coming from a town that is predominately Italian, I have searched long and hard for a restaurant that would fulfill the needs of my taste buds.  I grew up eating Italian sausage, baked ziti, chicken parmesan, and meatballs, served with homemade marinara made with tomatoes that we grew in our backyards.

One trip to Giada's, and I realized that this place reminded me of home.  The Chicken Parm, the Meatballs, the Italian Sausage, and Marinara Sauce were absolutely DELICIOUS-- I had flashbacks to my childhood and my tastebuds were finally satisfied-- in my 18 years of living in the Las Vegas area, I had yet to find my back home restaurant, and the day I stepped into Giada's, I knew that this place was it.

The service was excellent, the atmosphere calming and romantic, the wine and beer selection vast, the service friendly and attentive, portions generous, and flavor like no other.  

The owner Daniel personally delivered our appetizer, and even checked back on us after we got our entrees. He told us everything from the menu was one of his grandma's recipes, and his friendly demeanor made me want to go back to eat 2 days later.

CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!!!! Friendly staff and big portions pleasing to the taste buds!!!  My new favorite authentic Italian ristorante!!"}
{"text":"You can book a reservation online. Waitress was super helpful and friendly. Food came out fast. Presentation is nice!!! Dessert is incredible."}
{"text":"Ate there last night and the food was excellent.  They have happy hour specials in the bar area (discounted apps / drinks) which are not offered in the dining area.  I think our waitress is fairly new and unfortunately not very efficient with her service (not prioritizing properly?).  I'm sure she will get better.  The owner was very nice and luckily was helping to tend to the tables.  The bread and olive spread was delicious!  I ordered the Chicken Penne Vodka and my wife ordered the Eggplant Parmesan; both dishes delicious."}
{"text":"Great family freindly place. Sat in the bar area for happy hour. Amazing food made to order at a  great price!  Service was friendly and efficient. We will be back. Nice place to go on a Friday night without going near the strip."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner here last night. Our meals were delicious and plentiful! We both brought home half of our dinners. Yea, yummy left overs for tonight!! Our server was very sweet and she was running her tail off. We went around 8:00 and only the bar seating was open with one server. She was running to the kitchen to deliver food to the tables AND pouring the drinks at the bar. Amazing! We had a wonderful experience and will definitely go back. A dining gem right in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. It's a great mom and pop restaurant with excellent food and service. There is nothing like being greeted when you walk in. Then getting acknowledged by the owner (several times).  I've been here five times now - and I have zero complaints. This is what \"real\" Italian food is all about!

My last visit included the fried calimari as a starter. It was light and not greasy at all.  In the past I have eaten the chicken park (lightly breaded and pounded thin) perfect. The spaghetti and meatballs had homemade sauce and homemade meatballs. But my favorite dish to date is the stuffed eggplant.  I also appreciate their liberal corkage policy (you only pay corkage the first time u bring a bottle.  After that there is no charge. You can't beat that!!  Since I'm working my way down the menu - I have to go back!!"}
{"text":"Well...didn't we find a little gem in our own backyard!! Decided to try this little Italian place after driving by it for the last 2 years. What the heck was I waiting for???

Our server, Tara was a total sweetheart..and the food was amazing! Started with their bread and olive tapenade, loved it. Next the Baked Clams and Calamari appetizers, both were perfectly done and the Marinara dipping sauce was really good!
Main course...Mac n Cheese and the best Chicken Marsala we've ever had!! Had to get the desert to go...to full!!!
We will definitely be back...SOON!!!"}
{"text":"Such a great local Italian place. The food is excellent, staff attentive and a great atmosphere. The meatballs are excellent. You can have them low carb with vegetables."}
{"text":"This place is a gem in the heart of Anthem.  Great food, great service, great atmosphere!   Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great place, just had some awesome stuffed mushroom with gorgonzola cheese,tomatoes with mozzarella on top. Tried the Rigatoni Bolognese and it is the best sauce and the amount served was perfect. My friend had the spaghetti and meatballs and raved about them. They include a great salad. The bread and dipping was great too.. I will be back with friends. Can't wait to try their other items on the menu.
Thanks to Lou the owner And Sabby our waitress for a great meal."}
{"text":"Not really impressed with this restaurant.  First of all, it was incredibly hot in there.  I understand that the pizza ovens are right in the middle of the restaurant, but how about cranking up the AC or at least get some ceiling fans? The food was ok-I had the penne with vodka sauce.  The staff was very friendly and attentive so that was a good point.  But I don't know if I would go there again as my companions thought the food was mediocre as well."}
{"text":"We are always looking for new places nearby to try with the family. I have been here now twice and it is very consistent. Last night took the wife and daughter and we all liked our meals, My daughter got Chicken Planks and Fries, she liked the chicken, but did not like the fries,they were made from real potatoes, she likes processed, only critique would be the Fries could have been crispier, but hey they were unprocessed, I give them big props for that . 

They bring you a focaccia bread with this awesome (Grandma's recipe) Olive dip, really good and I'm not a big fan of olives. I ordered the Chicken Joseph which was Chicken rolled up with a garlic, olive oil, spinach, mozzarella, ricotta cheese mixture, topped with a tomato cream sauce, with garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed vegetables. A little strange to get Garlic mash but it was great and so was the meal. My last meal I had here was the Pollo Giada's Boneless chicken breast, rolled with prosciutto di parma, spinach, mozzarella cheese topped with tomato brandy sauce, served with garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed vegetables both were great but my favorite was the Pollo Giada.

My wife ordered off the menu and they accommodated her, she just wanted Penne Pasta with Garlic and Olive oil, which they made and she loved it. She also had the house wine and it was happy hour(4pm-7pm) so she got one free. Both meals were accompanied with a house salad with a great spicy Balsamic dressing (not for the feint of heart, it had spice) and Broccoli, Spinach and carrots with a liberal amount of garlic and Olive oil.

 I finished my veges so on my daughters insistence we ordered the Ice Cream Brownie, it could easily have feed 4 or one growing daughter who didn't want to share. The Brownie covered an entire dinner plate with two huge scoops of Ice Cream topped with Chocolate sauce. Overall a great experience and price was good too

Give this place a try it is a small place behind Vons on the way into Anthem, their decor is not the greatest but it is all family pictures so I get that. They also do pizza and takeout."}
{"text":"Wow. Major disappointment.

We used the free house wine offer, and gave it to my mom.

I ordered the \"crispy\" (deep fried) and \"sticky\" (covered in mozz cheese) balls (I guess they are trying to make the old ladies blush when they read the menu) in diablo hot. ($10) for two. I also ordered a Caesar salad. 

My guy asked the owner (who was our waiter, and parks his lambo on the sidewalk, in front of the place) what dish is their best, especially for first comers. His answer... Chicken Parm.... really? Chicken parm? He got the marsala.

We ordered calamari for an appetizer. It was not crispy. It was flavorless. Seriously, needed salt and pepper.

My beef balls came (haha, they are suppose to be \"gourmet). The extra money you spend to have them \"crispy\" and \"sticky\" go to waste. There was no texture to these meat balls. They were pure mush. The sauce was pretty good though, and spicy.

When the marsala was delivered, I knew that the veggies on the side were either frozen, or out of a can. The carrots were the circles with the crinkle pattern on them, and the broccoli was just the stems, not the fluffy tops. The marsala sauce was overly sweet.

Overall, Meh. No thanks."}
{"text":"Very good, between all the members of my party had the Fettuccine Alfredo, Chicken Marsala, Penne Bolognese, Eggplant Parmesan, Chicken Francaise, and Mushroom Caps.  All were delicious, no complaints from anyone at the table.  Service was very good too.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Pizza sauce is \"non-remarkable!\"  The owner works the bar and is a very nice fellow, but the food we've had is just not up to snuff. Locally, there much better pizza just around the corner at Joey's NY Pizza and if you go a little further to Green Valley, Settebello rocks.

If you want top quality food, and incredible service go to \"Giada's\" at the Cromwell on the Strip!"}
{"text":"My first visit to this restaurant but I will return.  It is divided into two sections:  a bar (with happy hour prices) and a casual restaurant.   I chose the latter and was greeted and given my choice of tables.  An olive spread and fresh bread were brought immediately.  

I ordered the Bolognese, with spaghetti rather than penne.  It was very, very good.  I especially like that it was brought hot from the kitchen with the pasta a dente.  The pasta was neither thick nor thin -- an excellent medium thickness.  My only complaint was that the onions in the house salad were rather strong.

The chef made rounds of the tables during my stay.  Nice touch.

The waitress provided excellent service, checking after a few minutes each on the drink, salad, and entrée to ensure that they were satisfactory.  I was stuffed so brought the tiamasu home with me -- I already checked it out and it is delicious."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here. The olive dip is incredible. The owner is super nice and has always treated my family wonderfully. I don't know the owner or staff but this is the closest spot to our house and there is never a wait so when We just don't feel like cooking we head here!!!  Try the lemon cake!!!  The menu prices are a little higher but the portions are huge and it's two meals (or 3!) worth for us! My family of foodies was impressed and grateful for the pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I have tried several different entrees at Giada's and they have all been very good.  My husband did once get a dish with undercooked shrimp but they remedied the situation immediately.  The wait staff have always been very friendly and attentive.  It is a cute little restaurant and the owner has always been present when I am there and he appears to really care about his business providing a good dining experience.  It is the best dining experience to be found in Anthem."}
{"text":"I never knew italian food could be so good!! If it's possible for food to taste this good I don't understand why everybody doesn't make it like Giada's does. MWAH!!"}
{"text":"Recently my husband and I with friends decided to try Giada's. What a disappointment. There were very few people in the restaurant and we were seated right away. Our waitress finally came and asked for our drink order. It took nearly 20 minutes before they finally came. She then took our dinner order. Nearly45 minutes later our dinner arrived. My husband had ordered spaghetti and meatballs and the spaghetti was overdone and barely warm. I had ordered the meatballs as had our friend. I had the white sauce and my friend had the marinara. Our meatballs were more meal than meat and were barely warm. I called the waitress over and sent them back. When she brought them back she said to be careful the plate was very hot. The plate was indeed very hot, but my meatballs were not any warmer than when she brought them the first time. I'm not sure how the plate got so hot and the meatballs and sauce were still so cool that the sauce had a \"skin\" over the top of it. No one ever came to clear the table. We had to request our bill and ended up getting up to find out where we should go to pay. To sum it up....the service was poor, the food was below par and sadly we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Never ever order at this place!!! I just placed an order delivery. The driver showed up 1:45 later when 45-60 min promised. I leave in apartment complex so  when he finally showed up I gave him a code to buzz inside. He seamed to not being able to use it. We had to go down stairs and get the food ourself when we did no one was by the door! 
Confused went back to the apartment looked outside from the balcony...so I see that the driver just went back to the car and waited there FOR US to pick up the food. When we asked why he said \"well you should be thankful I brought you damn food motherf...r!!! Started yelling on all neighborhood, cursing then got back in the car and left! I'm calling to the restaurant and they don't pick up! People like this should never be in any service business and it is a restaurant management fault to let this things happen!"}
{"text":"Great small neighborhood restaurant feel. The chef usually pops out to make sure you are enjoying your meal. Great food and friendly staff. I highly recommend the spicy meatballs."}
{"text":"Giada's Italian Cucina has excellent food and good service.   We went on a Saturday night.  The restaurant has about 20 tables, so reservations are a great idea if you plan on going to Giada's on a potentially busy night.

We ordered a calamari appetizer and it was one of the best we've had in Las Vegas in quite some time.  The chicken convertino was an interesting dish I haven't had before, and it was really good.  My wife's eggplant parmigiana was also excellent.  Each entree came with a yummy salad too.  The food all came to the table quickly and was the perfect temperature.  Portions were just the right size (not gargantually large, not too small to leave you hungry).

We used a Groupon coupon and they gladly accepted it.  The only problem was that when the restaurant filled up, the only waitress was way overworked and service declined (really not her fault).  It would help the restaurant if they increased the wait staff during potentially busy nights, but if the place is empty then they would be overstaffed.  A tough call for a small place like this.


For really great Italian food in the Henderson area, Giada's is an excellent choice."}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place, it's so close to home...BUT...  The food was horrific and the price was completely out of Line. $26 for spaghetti and a piece of grilled chicken on top???? Would never mind paying that if it was good, but it wasn't... Sauce was over cooked.  However,  the service is good and the drinks are reasonable, will go for drinks but will not be eating again."}
{"text":"My wife and I usually try to frequent dining establishments once a week, on Saturday nights, and we were very lucky to have finally found this establishment giadas. The waitress Nicole was excellent and accommodating to our two year old girl, paid attention to my wife's very delicate tastes and the owner came over severL times to ensure the food was right and we were satisfied. We started off with the mushroom appetizers which were fabulous. My wife had pasta figioli soup which was spot on and I had linguine and clams. The linguini was generous and my wife's chicken platter was out of this world. This is a great, laid back, small restaurant with simply fabulous food. Good willing, we will be back!"}
{"text":"The lasagna was excellent. As was the sauce. Portions were generous.   I could of ate the bread and olive dip all night.  
The service was great.  The waitress filled my drink 3 times and I didn't even notice that she had.
We will be coming back!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Having heard about Giadas from a friend my wife and I decided to give this amazing restaurant a try. Upon our  arrival we were greeted by the owner Danny and quickly felt at home. The olive spread that was given with the ciabatta bread was spectacular. Our appetizer was the fried ravioli and again my expectations were quickly exceeded, i highly recommend the fried raviolis. Please take a moment and admire the family pictures and long history. Our main courses arrived i had the lasagna and must say it was everything i could have wished for. We have made plans to have our date night here every month. A huge thank you to Danny and his staff for an excellent evening."}
{"text":"A restaurant that should be spotlighted always!! There dinner and appetizers are on point. We truly enjoyed our experiences here. Thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"Went the other night with my family. Glad we tried it but will not go back. Server was nice, bread was awful and the food was nothing to write home about. I had the shrimp fradiavolo, nothing special, small shrimp floating in sauce with, over cooked pasta. My daughter had the pizza, pizza dough was terrible and raw like the stale bread they gave us. My wife had the puttanesca and they actually put olives with the pitts ...LOLOL! i guess they can't afford pitted Kalamata. Do they not warn people of this so they do not chip a tooth. I hear the owner is from Westchester NY. WOW is he fooling the people in Henderson. I asked the waitress why the Faux pizza brick oven in the front was not on and she said it was too hot! LOL. You would think they would have thought that out before investing in a oven of that caliber. Personally it looks like this may have been place that was owned by someone before that was smart and got out. The ownner now is clueless about Italian food and service and is trying to fool the people into believing it is authentic when it is really just...cheap food done wrong.  If you are going to try and sell a authentic premise...have authentic food. I will be surprised if they last much longer with whoever is cooking in the back. Its too bad because the place is cute, cozy with potential."}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service. I even left a message and never received a response back. That says a lot about a business. I will never spend my money here again."}
{"text":"As always outstanding food and service. We've been dining here for over a  year now and we have never been disappointed! The food has always been spectacular and the ambiance of the restaurant fabulous. I highly reccomend this restaurant for authentic Italian dining. The owner really takes pride in providing a fabulous dining experience for his guest and it shows. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Great food n good customer service . We had them catered a party for us too."}
{"text":"After Mom spotted this restaurant on Groupon, she decided it was time to try out a new Italian joint. We were absolutely not dissappointed!

The moment we walked into the door, we were greeted by a gentleman and taken to our table. He introuduced himself as the owner, which I thought was awesome. The waitress, Heather, came by a moment later and brought us some fresh bread with an olive dip and our drinks. She was just as nice as the owner, and did a great job throughout the night.

For an appetizer, we had the Mozzerella Sticks ($8), which were amazing. One order consisted of five sticks, which were way larger than your average mozzerella stick and tasted great.

Both of our entrees came with a leafy salad that was covered in a tasty house dressing, I want to say vinigarette, but I can't rightly remember. In any case, I normally don't like leafy salad at all, but this one was wonderful!

For dinner, Mom had the Rigatoni Bolognese ($17) and I had a 14 oz. Strip Steak that came with Fettucini Alfredo and skewers of Peppers and Mushrooms ($34). They were both excellent as well. 

Lastly, we had a cannolli ($8). It was FABULOUS! It had a soft shell, and was covered in chocolate and powdered sugar. If it weren't so tasty, there would have been no way we would have been able to cram it down after the entrees.

We will DEFINENTLY be coming back to Giada's soon! Hopefully, sometime in the next week!"}
{"text":"This review is for delivery order. I haven't been to the restaurant, but after tasting the food, I definitely won't be giving it another shot. This is the most disappointed I have been with a restaurant in Vegas. Period. 

We ordered ridiculously overpriced ($23) spaghetti and meatballs, which is pretty hard to totally screw up. The meatballs were inedible and seemed like they must have been at least a week old and weren't even reheated. The \"sauce\" was barely coating the noodles and was flavorless and mealy, similar to what my high school cafeteria served. The $10 ceasar salad was a pile of lettuce with powdered parmesan (!) and croutons that were like rocks and had to be picked out of the salad. Even the beverages we ordered weren't correct.

Overall, I would never consider eating here again. The prices belong on the strip and the food belongs in the garbage. Ick.

*My boyfriend would not even eat his portion of this meal. In the 6 years we have been together that has never happened. *"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. They had just started doing lunch. Lunch menu is a bit sparse, so we asked to do the dinner menu and they agreed. Wine list is a bit sparse, but serviceable. Calamari fritti was very good, might use a bit more salt. Pasta(Pepperdella) was OK, but past al dente. They did let us split this dish as a primo. Chicken giada was a bit dry. Veal picatta was OK, but serving was pretty small for price. Cannolli was fresh and made with ricotta filling freshly blended. 

BTW, owner's grandmother was named Giada; not related to TV Giada."}
{"text":"Great real Italian food. If you expect olive garden this is not your place but it is the go to place for good Italian food. The owner is really nice everything I have tried here is good. Truly authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"The whole family met here after church on MOTHERS DAY.... It was unbelievable. Loved the decor. Loved the layout of the tables, don't feel all cramped up. Loved the hostess, all dressed up and beautiful manners. Loved the menu. Loved the variety. Loved all the dishes we ordered (so we could try them out). Loved we were all served at the same time(we were a party of 14). Loved our servers, NEVER had to ask for anything twice. The staff anticipates your wants and are prompt. We LOVE your new home in Henderson Giada!!!  And the best was after desert the gave us menus to take home BECAUSE THEY DELIVER EVERYTHING ON THE MENU!!!!!  Unforgettable outstanding experience. Congratulations to entire staff"}
{"text":"Went for the second time tonight. As amazing as my first visit. Great staff; chef came out twice to check on us and the bartender (Terra) is THE BEST. the food never disappoints. Lasagna was enough for at least 3 meals."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Giadas several times and we really enjoyed it. The service was great. We sat at the bar last night and I had a a chocolate, baileys something that was to die for. Trust me order it.... Yummy"}
{"text":"Holy cow this place is fantastic! After I read the front of the menu and understood the story behind this place, I was super excited. Then, I tasted the food and the story came true. A new favorite!"}
{"text":"Was craving chicken Parmesan and I know only \"mom & pop\" spots are the way to go. It was exactly what we were looking for. Purchased to go and it was delicious. I'm sure if I had eaten at the restaurant it would've been even more delicious."}
{"text":"Hidden in a kind of hard to find location, this restaurant is awesome.  The owner refilled our drinks himself and the olive dip is to die for.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly from start to finish.  We started our dinner with the calamari appetizer which was well cooked, crip and tasty.  That was followed by a very unique and fresh salad.  One member of our table had the chicken parm, which was fantastic.  Myself and the other member had the chicken carvortino, which was chicken wrapped around asparagus and fontina in a marcella sauce.  It was delicious.  We split a bottle of chianti at the table and all enjoyed that as well.  The waitress as well as the owner were very attentive and made our experience all the better.  The location at first seemed a little bit small, but it quickly became the perfect atmosphere and ambiance for a great Italian meal.  I'll definitely go back and tell friends."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this gem last night because we had a Groupon. It's a cozy, classy little joint. We were greeted by the owner within seconds and seated shortly after. Our waitress greeted us warmly and mentioned some recommendations on the menu. There didn't seem to much of an established wine list. She rattled off some house varietals, but nothing specific. We asked her for a bottle of white and she returned with an Italian Chardonnay which ended up being delicious and well priced. We were started off with some tasty ciabatta bread with olive oil and a dollop of the best olive tapenade I've ever had. Dinner comes with a fresh spinach and romaine salad that was vibrant and refreshing. 
The menu is mostly Italian staples, with a few unique dishes. As a pescetarian I'd like to see another fresh fish and a few more vegetarian items, but the eggplant parmesan I had and seafood pasta my wife had were both excellent. The portions were big, but not overwhelming. We were too stuffed to try dessert.

Bottom line:
The atmosphere is sleek, but warm.
The owner seems humble and engaged in his restaurant.
Our server made us feel like we were regulars.
The food is simple and well executed.

A new favorite. Looking forward to bringing friends and family here."}
{"text":"The location it's very smart and beautiful. It's on the heart of Las Vegas strip. 
The appetizers where really good. The Caprese  salad and the spinach pizza where tasteful.  The selection of wines very well chosen and the prices are fair.  The variety of breads delicious.
My spaghetti was well seasoned but the portion was ridiculously small!
Service good and professional. The worst part of the restaurant are the hostess who are not knowledgable and far of being nice. Very impersonal."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try this restaurant the other night as we drive by it every day on our way to work. It is quaint, and has an intimate, sort of romantic setting. The service was consistently punctual throughout our meal. The bread with olives in olive oil was divine! Unfortunately, I cant say the same for the main course. My chicken was extremely rubbery, and my girlfriend's pasta was cold. Had the food been prepared to standard, I'd definitely try this restaurant again. Really cute spot with great service. They just need to work on preparation and food times."}
{"text":"The service is still a bit... Wonky. In a recent visit, our server would not stop talking to us to the point where it was disturbing and intrusive to our meal. Other times, I've gone in to order carry out and I can't seem to find anyone for a few minutes. Still, I think their hearts are in the right place and they're very friendly. I just wish they were a bit more professional.

The atmosphere could use some updating, as it's a bit run down.

The owner is super nice, love how he gives military and veteran discounts.

I find the salads to be extremely fresh, the bread and olive tapenade to be excellent, their portion sizes to be very large, and their food to be very good. They have the best vodka sauce!

Overall, it's solid Italian food made from what tastes like authentic recipes. Recommend."}
{"text":"Now I just spoke with the owner and if he keeps his promise and his word then i will be satisfied. If you want to believe me then try it for yourself"}
{"text":"I am just reviewing their delivery, I have not dined in.

I have ordered from this restaurant twice. First time was so-so, and I wanted to give a second chance. This time was quite awful though. It took almost an hour and a half to arrive. The driver was very nice and apologetic. 

The food was packaged in containers that were literally melting because the food was hot and wrapped in saran-wrap. It's quite a bit of an un-wow, especially when your soup is melting the lid of the container.

The soup (pasta fagioli) was definitely unlike any soup I've ever had. It was penne pasta, a few white beans and a very small amount of runny flavorless marinara sauce. For nearly $10 for a cup of soup, I expect more. 

The pizza was plain and flavorless. There were a few large uncooked chunks of garlic under the cheese. 

The macaroni and cheese was penne pasta with melted mozzarella on top. No flavor and the cheese was hard on top. When I put a fork into it the cheese all came off the top and was see thru and hard. 

I really want to like this place, but for what they charge - the food is seriously lacking. Really disappointed!"}
{"text":"Giada's Italian Cucina is wonderful!  I had never heard of it until I saw a Groupon for it a couple of months ago. I am so glad my husband and I decided to try it.  It is a cozy, beautiful little restaurant with a great atmosphere, tucked away in Anthem. The owner was very welcoming and the waitress was very friendly and attentive.

For dinner I ordered the Shrimp Olvera, which was a Chef's special.  It was linguine served with jumbo shrimp and scallops and topped with a light alfredo sauce.  It was delicious!  My husband ordered the eggplant parmesan and it was also very good.  Our entrees were served with delicious field greens salads topped with roasted peppers, red onions, tomatoes and mozzarella. It was also served with bread, olive oil, and olive tapenade.  The olive tapenade was very flavorful and one of the best we have tasted.  We were too full to eat dessert, but we will definitely try it next time!

You can tell that the owner cares about the business and his customers.  We enjoyed Giada's and we will definitely be back to try some other Italian favorites!"}
{"text":"This is a very small mom and pop restaurant that had only 3 other tables occupied on the Thursday evening of our visit.  There are tablecloths on each table, but these are covered by white butcher paper.  We received menus followed by warm bread and a tasty olive tapenade.  A house salad with a creamy balsamic dressing is included in the price of all entrees. 

Ann ordered chicken convertino - a thinly sliced chicken breast stuffed with asparagus and fontina cheese which was topped with a mushroom marsala sauce.  I chose pollo Giada - a boneless chicken breast stuffed with prosciutto, spinach and fontina cheese topped by a brandy tomato sauce. Each was served with a side of penne.  Mine was a little more tender than Ann's, but both were delicious.

I used a restaurant.com certificate."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Giada's for our first anniversary. We ate in the lounge and our sever Lindsay was amazing!!!  She had great recommendations for food and drinks.  The atmosphere was awesome as well!  Thank you we will defiantly come back."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Giada's twice...it was excellent the first time and just as excellent the second time. It is now our go-to Italian food and we will make sure we keep going back. The service is excellent.  The first time we were there, the owner made sure to come by our table. The chef even came out of the kitchen to ensure we were enjoying our food. We were able to bring home leftovers both times. It is a cozy, quiet little place. A must try."}
{"text":"Very friendly! Nice clean place. Food was A-ok like the rating. Was lacking the WOW factor. After reviews thought I found a real gem, but it was just another GOOD place. Flavor would be my only complaint. I would go again. But I would not drive out of my way."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Heather was very refreshing, and it was a pleasure meeting the gracious owner and hearing about how Giada's came to be.  We were late for our reservation, so it really meant a lot that they were so accommodating.

We started with calamari and fresh bread, which were good.  I think we ordered about 3 additional baskets of bread!

The Chicken di Alexander and Shrimp Olvera were both very tasty.  Even the side salads were fresh and enjoyable- not just a thrown-together afterthought like at some other restaurants.

The only reason I'm withholding a star is because they only serve beer and wine- we're much more of a cocktail group.  Otherwise, it was great!"}
{"text":"First time dining here and wont be back. Not worth the money when you have so many other options. My friend's filet was served cold and they completely forgot the side of potatoes until we were finished with the meal. Portions, while what they should be were not worth the price. Friend is already planning a corn dog run down the street. The Busboy was the best part of the experience and kept refilling water and anything we needed. Already decided to get dessert elsewhere to avoid yet more disappointment."}
{"text":"This ain't Olive Garden.....

Funny, when we came in here, we were asked if we had reservations and only about 3-4 tables were full.  I kinda thought they were joking, and said, no we don't, is it okay or do we have to go to Olive Garden.  Anyway, of course they were ready to accommodate us and boy did they get busy quick.

1.  Service - I am not sure, but it seems that the owners are the one to meet and greet you. They know their stuff and are very pleasant. I really felt at home.

2.  Clientele - Seems to be a lot of regulars. You know what that means!  People looking for good quality and good value keep coming back.

3.  The food - 

Bread and Olives - Wow, I kept eating the Olive dip that they made. No idea of the proper name, yet it was amazing.

Salads - Nice mixed green salad with parmesan cheese and other bits like roasted peppers and onions.

Calamari - Light, crispy tender morsels of squid.  This was recommended by the owner and it was nice.

Lasagna - The wife had this, her standby favorite and she enjoyed it.

Steak Filet - Had the steak which was named also after the owner I believe. I cannot recall the name. I am a huge converted Filet person, as normally I prefer Rib Eye.  More tasty, more succulent, more tender. I originally was going to order their equivalent of the Cioppino and they recommended the Steak. It was okay for me. A lot of sauce, I wanted it med rare and I thought it was well done. A bit chewy for my taste.  However, the taste was pleasant, the service great, the people very friendly, so I ate it.  Not my most favorite Filet in Las Vegas, yet okay.

4.  Dolci and Vino - We did not have any of the dessert as we were going back to the house for dessert and coffee.  On the wine, we did not have any, however, I did overhear others ordering and I think it is best to ask what the owners have , as they may have certain wines depending on what they like and pair with their menu.

5.  The bill - Our friend paid for us as it was the wife's birthday. It seemed that they were quite busy and had others waiting, so I got the sense the bill came quickly and then the owners come by to ask you so nicely and courteously if all was good and they hope you come back.  Very cool, and I really did not feel like i was being asked kindly to leave so they can turn the table.....

I will try this place again. I enjoyed it.  For now, I give this place a 3.5 star, so I round it to 4 and we shall see next time I come... if it is a 4 or not...."}
{"text":"Last night I went to Giada's Italian Cucina in Henderson, NV for the first time with a party of 11 for a birthday party. Let me start out by saying the food was AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! The bread came to the table hot with an olive Tepanade in oil. The problem was they didn't give us enough bread, and certainly not fast enough. They had a mini bread oven that could not accommodate the crowd. BUT the food was unbelievable! The bread, salad, calamari, muscles, anti pasta, pizza, Penne AL la Vodka, and Chicken Giada, eggplant parmigiana, were all amazingly good! The NY Cheesecake, Tiramisu, and Cannolis continued to pleasure our tastebuds......The only draw back was since the restaurant can only accommodate about 40 people, and we had a party of 11, it seemed a bit tight with the seating, the bread was in short supply and the waitress was overwhelmed with the crowd...This would not stop me from returning to the restaurant although, I would not go with a large crowd again. One other issue was the owner got a little sassy with my stepdaughter when she asked for steak which was not on the menu, but was in a review in Giada's review section. That was dissapointing. But again, the food was too good not to go back, and the waitress tried very hard not to show her stress level. This restaurant is a MUST TRY IT!!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Giadas a few weeks ago and loved the service and food. Our visit didn't start off well because we wanted to take advantage of the Happy Hour and were barked at by the bar waitress that we had to sit on the other side because she was busy. We were greeted on the other side of the restaurant and had good service. The owner and the chef even stopped by our table to say hi. we had appetizers and a pizza. Some of the best clams Ive ever had. We will be back."}
{"text":"I love the food here! If you live in Henderson and want to hit up a local Italian restaurant for some good grub, look no more. This is it. Awesome service, also great tiramisu! Nom noms for sure!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant as there are not a lot of dining options in the Anthem area however, I was disappointed.   We went there with our two small children, which we thought would be fine as we looked up the menu online and saw that they have a kids menu.  When we got there we asked for juice or milk for our 3 year old daughter to drink.  The server told us they did not have either and that \"most people don't bring their kids there\".  I felt that was a slightly rude comment to make considering we did bring our kids there.  He finally found some orange juice at the bar which he served our 3 year old in a pint glass.  They did not have kid appropriate cups.  I think if you have a children's menu, which specifies for children \"under 8\", you should provide a cup that a child under 8 can drink out of.  The restaurant was out of veal!  This is ridiculous considering half of the menu options include veal.  The service was slow even though we were the only table in the whole restaurant from 5pm until 6:30 on a Saturday night.  The eggplant parmigiana was extremely greasy as was the lasagna.  The chicken francese was bland and the marinara sauce was nothing spectacular.   Very disappointed.  The one good thing was the bread and olive tapenade."}
{"text":"If I could give a rating about the food, I would. Unfortunately we have tried to eat here twice, yet never even saw the menu and walked out. 
The 1st visit: we arrived right before 9pm, the staff was obviously trying to close. Told us they would seat us, \"if we wanted to dine in\"....I have been in the staffs situation, and was ok with not staying. Nobody wants to serve anyone when they are trying to close shop...even though it was an hour before closing hours. 
The 2nd visit: we always give 2nd chances to our local businesses. As Anthem residents, we love small unfranchised places in our community, so we hoped the 1st visit wasn't a norm. We walked in the entrance, not a human to be seen...so we ventured into the next dining area where we heard voices. One table of about 6 diners and the waiter close by. We stood there for what felt like 5 mins, but was closer to 2, without even a nod from the waiter. The diners looked over, but even they wouldn't speak to us. So guess what, we left. 
My husband and I were very sad that your service has been such a disappointment, and we hope you give better service to others. You can't get any worse."}
{"text":"I visited here based on the reviews and think that it was ok.  The service was good and the food was just good, not great. The salad that came with our entree was ok. Fresh grated cheese on my $30 menu item would have made sense to me not grated cheese out of a jar.  When asking for a wine menu, she rather figure out what you want (not sure if they don't have them typed up or not).  Asked for Proseco, .. did not have, then any sparkling wine, did not have, then settled on a wine that was no longer on the list that she told us about.  I probably won't go back but am glad we tried it."}
{"text":"As mentioned by another Yelper, once we walked in, we were greeted and asked if we had a reservation. I overheard that there was a special for making a reservation and being sat before 6pm, but that was all. I could not make out anything else.

While we did not have an allotted time, we were sat quickly. Those who do not call ahead, or use Open Table, were sat at the front of the restaurant. This is not a bad spot by no means, because people walking in and out did not cause a stir. Some places, the door table is a dreaded spot, but I hardly noticed anyone until the staff greeted them.

The food is ok. Fresh warm bread with an olive tapanade is served right away. We started with the calamari appetizer ($11). The squid was tender and fried to a light brown. It would be perfect if it possessed some flavor. Neither the batter nor sauce tasted like much. No lemon to spruce it up either. My friend ordered the Veal Florentine ($24) and it was lackluster. For this price, it was rather skimpy. The sauteed spinach with garlic was fantastic. I got the Shrimp Fra Diavolo ($22) and was not knocked off my feet. The sauce has a nice spiciness, but the shrimp was overcooked. 

Our waitress was nice, but seemed flustered. She wasn't around too much, but was kind when present."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Italian restaurants in the valley. The olive dipping sauce is so good its addicting. The chicken is so tender it melts in your mouth. The pasta is just delicious. The kids love coming here to eat and we go at least once a week. The atmosphere is nice; quite the way I like it. The chef knows what we eat and he comes out to meet us when we enter. No complaints about the service; it's prompt and courteous. 

If you are looking for an Italian place in the area I strongly suggest Giadas!"}
{"text":"I love this cute little gem of a place tucked away in Anthem. I met Pat and Jerry who own the bar attached to Giada's at my restaurant supply in Henderson and they told me about their place, and my hubby and I always like to try our customer's places which we did and are very happy to say we are now repeat customers! The food is delicious, the pasta is cooked perfectly al dente everytime, everything is flavorful, the service is superb, just a really great local place that makes you want to return! It is fun to sit in the bar area where you can also comfortably eat, and the best part, no slot machines! Go see Pat & Jerry, & the bartender Marie, eat some fab food and have a great time!"}
{"text":"What a great family restaurant. Great service and terrific food. Chef came out to make sure that we liked our entrees. Eggplant lasagna the best. Portions very generous, you won't leave hungry! Owner Daniel nicest guy in the world. Great family recipes all from his grandparents."}
{"text":"Last night,I took my girl friend to Giada's.We both loved it! I had the lobster ravioli,which had nice size chunks of lobster meat inside.The bread and garlic dipping sauce was amazing!We also took a pizza to go for my dates daughter.Needless to say I scored major points with my date and her daughter.Plan to go back soon.

{"text":"This was a great little find hidden up in Anthem near the Von's. We stopped in for dinner and were greeted quickly. It was explained to us that the restaurant is divided in half and the bar side had a happy hour. We decided on that since its a great way to try the food (and get cheap drinks of course!). 

Tara came over and explained that it was a small family run business and all the recipes are from the owners grandmother. They offer happy hour from 4-6 with $3 beers (I had a Peroni) and $4 house wine and liquor. Most appetizers are only $6. Tara brought us out bread and the most delicious olive spread. Im not a huge olive fan but this spread was absolutely delicious. 

A house salad followed with probably the best homemade balsamic vinegar Ive ever had. It was the perfect balance of sweet and tangy, I could have just drank it. Tara told us it is house made every day and it shows. We shared the fried ravioli and the calamari. The fried ravioli were huge, stuffed with ricotta and spinach and fried to a very nice crispy golden brown. The calamari were good as well, but nothing like the raviolis. 

We also shared a penne with vodka sauce. Tara was nice enough to bring out fresh grated parmesan for us. I thought the pasta was cooked perfectly but the sauce was actually quite bland for me. Luckily the cheese helped add some flavor. We finished off with a slice of Tiramisu and again it was one of the best I have had. So creamy and soft and full of flavor. Dusted with chocolate powder it was the perfect ending. 

I am really glad I found this place and I will definitely be returning to try some of their other entrees but I think the meats were priced really high, almost strip prices so will stick with the Italian favorites. Besides those few minor complaints it was really really hot inside. The A/C needs to be fixed or turned cooler, otherwise this place could be 5 stars!"}
