{"text":"As with so much of the food offerings from this area, what I encountered here today is a great concept, poorly executed. I like the market/restaurant/cafe combo, and was excited about visiting here, as it's quite close to home for me. And, while I enjoyed the market and the cafe, the restaurant fell short. It's a lovely enough space, with farm house style tables for communal dining and a wood fired oven. The menu is concise and easy to understand: pizza, sandwiches, salad and wood fired wings. I tried a salad with their house dressing and wood fired chicken, and a cup of their house soup, which is creamy tomato and roasted red pepper. I enjoyed the soup, but the salad was a disappointing mess. Their house dressing is a balsamic vinaigrette, which was not great tasting and had enough dried herbs in it that they resembled lawn cuttings. The roasted veggies were fine, but the chicken breast was so dry...well, the Sahara is a dewy oasis in comparison to this chicken breast. For the exective chef, if you're reading this...I would rather wait and have you fire up a fresh chicken breast than eat the one your staff cooked off this morning and then rewarmed in the oven. Chicken cooked this way will never, ever be moist and tasty. I know it saves you time and makes things move along more smoothly to do as much prep ahead of time as possible, but this is one area where you might want to not cut corners. I ended up sending my salad back and getting another that was equally dry. That was their opportunity to do it right, so they failed twice. I like the market and the cafe, but will be skipping lunch at this place in the future."}
{"text":"I love this place! What a cute place to get a quick meal. My husband and I were in the area this weekend and needed to grab something for lunch. The outside of the building drew us in and I have to say, I'm hooked. If I lived anywhere near the area, I would definitely be a regular. I can't comment on the salads or chicken as the other reviewers have but, the pizza is delicious. My husband and I split a margherita pizza and got peach gelato from the attached market. The pizza tasted very authentic. Reminded me of our vacation to Rome and Florence.  The gelato was very flavorful as well and tasted of ripe peaches. To comment on the previous posts, there are two t.v.'s at the front of the restaurant which are hooked up to cameras in the kitchen so you can actually watch your meal being prepared. I watched the cook roll out my pizza, add topping and put it in the pizza oven. I also watched as she prepared salads and accepted money. Anytime that food was prepared, she put on a pair of gloves. The only downfall I see is the price of the dishes. Our pizza was $11 for a 10 inch pizza cut into 4 slices. The prices seem to reflect that of a restaurant not a small cafe/cucina. However, I would definitely suggest a stop for pizza and gelato if you are ever in the area."}
{"text":"Was out with the wife doing some fishing in Canonsburg & happened by this place. We decided to stop & have lunch. The first thing you notice is 2 long tables surrounded by chairs. Family style seating has never been a problem with me. Second thing I notice was a short line of people waiting to order & the line wasn't getting any shorter. I'm starting to think we've made a mistake.  Far from it. The reason for the wait was that everything is cooked to order. I had Uncle Sal's Famous Hot Sausage Sandwich. Best hot sausage sandwich I've ever had. Was told by an employee that Uncle Sal comes in every Wednesday to make the sausage by hand.  Also, there are cameras mounted so that you can watch your food being prepared on closed curcuit TV.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try the latest local restaurant.  I really need a go to place for lunch in a pinch and just have nothing to eat in the McMurray area at all.  I loved the concept.  The market, cafe and coffee shops all in a row.  It's really beautiful, I love the menu and the place was packed.  I was ready.    I ordered the 3 brothers sandwich.  Veggies in foccacia with a side salad basically.   They have pasta, pizzas, soups and salads as well as sandwiches baked in a brick oven.  The pizzas looked good but I wasn't really in the mood.  Besides, each one that came out got a ridiculous looking handful of parm or something to finish and made me cringe a little.  I would have to try one to see what they're all about.    My sandwich was a little salty.  The foccacia wasn't great and I really thought that instead of button mushrooms it should have had portabellas.  The side salad looked nice but I absolutely hated the balsamic dressing.  It was awful and they put it on absolutely everything.  I think it was the olive oil they use that I objected to.  It didn't go with the vinegar or something it just was all off somehow and I really didn't like it.  I also thought it wasn't a great value.  You don't get enough food for the money.  I tried my wife's salad with grilled chicken.  The chicken wasn't edible and she had the same dressing.  The Italian baguette they served with it was a little on the stale side and beside that I saw the lady who handled the money dishing them out on plates.  Don't touch the money and then touch my food please.    Go check out the nice little market and have a cup of coffee next door.  The market serves cold sandwiches and you probably can't go wrong there.  It's a nice concept.  Maybe they'll pull it together over time.  I am pulling for them."}
{"text":"The market-restaurant-cafe combo is very nice. My wife makes the Italian seven-fishes dinner for Christmas eve and the anchovies we got from the market were the best. I've had the sandwiches a few times and they are very good. The hot peppers are nice if you like a good kick in the taste buds. The only drawback is the limited menu."}
