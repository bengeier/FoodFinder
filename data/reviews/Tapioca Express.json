{"text":"This place is amazing but yelp you need to change your hours apparently they are closed Friday drove over there and.not open"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Vegas is the foodie n entertainment capital of the world! So many choices n varieties. Tapioca Express is one of those Boba Tea House that is above the rest of the pack. Their ingredients r fresh new natural. Not like so many Boba Drink stores that use artificial flavorings. I love the extensive selections of drinks which includes teas, juices, smoothies, shave ice, tea lushes, expressos, milk teas, n import sodas. Their snacks r great too, just wish they have more selection n not the norm I can find in another Boba place! But their specialty drinks like the Fruit Yogurt Frost Smoothies will keep me coming back for more......!"}
{"text":"Being from California I love TapEx & to find one in Las Vegas is awesome ! I love how clean the restaurant is, customer service is 100% & the food/ drinks are great."}
{"text":"I visited this place for the first time. The interior looks very new and it's nicely decorated. I tried the strawberry and banana with boba. I noticed they did not use real strawberries, but instead they used a syrup. Taste wise, still tastes very much like strawberry and banana though! 

I would recommend this place for boba."}
{"text":"Great boba place that also has a few special appetizer dishes you can order. There is a variety of smoothies, juices, hot or iced teas, hot or iced coffees. There is also a variety of toppings or additions for your drink such as jellies or red beans. The venue has a modern feel to it and friendly, helpful staff, and clean bathrooms. Flavors come from the more popular avocado and matcha to fruit flavors."}
{"text":"The place looks pretty promising. That changes the moment you talk to one of the cashiers. I asked her about one of the items in the menu, and she looked really puzzled. She then answered that she doesn't know at all mainly because she doesn't work in the kitchen. That right there is a bright red flag that I probably should have left. As someone that works at a restaurant, you should be well aware of what it is you're selling. Not only that but she also made various mistakes on our order. All of this was going on while manager was clearly standing next to her. He did absolutely nothing to help us or clarify anything. The food, itself, is not as appetizing especially for it's price. I do not recommend getting the sisig fries. It was pretty disgusting."}
{"text":"Must try captain crunch boba and deep fried Oreos. You have no idea what you're missing! The food there is great also! It's honestly my top 2 places I love since I moved here. Love you guys!! I just edge you had punch cards for a free drink cause I literally go all the time"}
{"text":"Awesome place but I can't say it's the best in Las Vegas. The only thing I like about this place is the option of having egg pudding & small tapioca. However, when adding egg pudding you can't adjust the sweetness. When I ordered a regular milk tea with the egg pudding, it was just like sipping through a bland/no flavor pudding. Since I've tried other drinks like the honeydew- it's good! Saw them make it with fresh cut but frozen melon. 

If ordering any food here like their small 3pcs of taro bun, just go to Seafood City and you can get about 6-9pcs for the same price. I have not yet tried any other snacks they offer but I'm scared to due to portion and unreasonable prices.

Still earn my 4 stars for having a delicious boba though. Enough for me to come back when I can. I know that the store is still new but I believe they'll make progress."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Specially their CHI CHI FRIES  && PORK SISIG with rice are diggitybomb  !!"}
{"text":"I love tapex. Moved here from San Diego and I was super excited to have one here. What I don't like is that they're short staffed. Waited almost 20 mins for two drinks..... That's horrible a super slow service because they're so short staffed."}
{"text":"Very tasty taro smoothie with boba. They offer a regular size or large. First time here and I will be back. They have a big variety of drinks and they also offer a few food items. Very clean and nice place to hangout."}
{"text":"The staff are unorganized, the food took too long, and the quality of the food could be better, and the service needs improvement."}
{"text":"this place is awesome.  so glad we have one. .quality of boba and drinks are great. and food is good.  BUT they need to change the time on yelp because it says OPEN till MIDNIGHT but when we came Saturday at 10 it was close!"}
{"text":"Visiting from California and surprised to find this place. 
Located by Seafood City, so now I can get my favorite drinks and shop! It really helps with the not shopping while thirsty or hungry, haha. 

Staff is really great at this new location.
I highly recommend the boba here, it has the perfect consistency - not too hard or squishy."}
{"text":"First and foremost i liked boba tea and this place was close to us. The cashier or order taker was grumpy young lady. I asked one question since its my first time here and she gave me a mean look while answering my question. It wasnt even busy so i don't know what's her problem. Then the person making the drinks was also grumpy, banging kitchen stuff. None of them smiled or welcomed us. 

To the owner or manager, pls teach your staff customer service. 

The drinks were alright. I ordered chocolate but tasted like it's old. 

Place doesn't look clean.

Wont come back because of the attitude of the servers."}
{"text":"so i give this place a 2 star because i made a mistake on my order. so i ordered a thai tea boba and then the cashier said thai tea snow bubble. i didnt order that. so i told her and she told me, \"next time we wont fix your order if you mess up.\" what kind of customer service is that? i love the thai tea boba though. its awesome. i didnt like boba before i tried this. besides the customer service the place is a great place to chill!"}
{"text":"Variety of drinks, iced, hot, smoothies, fruit or coffee drinks. Priced from $2ish to $3ish. Snacks like appetizers and plate combos from $3ish to $8ish. Many tables if wanna eat in. Employee was helpful and patient since our.  Ordered sisig rice combo, crispy chx rice combo, iced jasmine milk tea, iced caramel macchiato, and mango snow bubble (smoothie). Can choose heat level for the dishes. We would come back."}
{"text":"Was not happy with my experience today. I drove all the way there to get boba on this hot day and some snacks, but was not able to get them. Their Internet was down so I couldn't pay for my food I ordered. Very disappointed. Next time before you head there call them. Make sure that their internet systems aren't down."}
{"text":"Went here for a pre-gym snack around 4pm today involving lots of carbs. Sitting at a good location, next to seafood city, this place is a perfect magnet for APIs, looking for a snack.

Service was acceptable. They called our names in a timely manner, but they forgot that we ordered a green tea with our food. So, they rushed to make it.

The food was great. The tea was nice. It was sweet with a nice aroma that hit the back of my palate the more I drank. The sisig fries were delicious. Exactly what you'd expect, fatty, carby, filling, and bomb.com. It was more than sufficient for that bulky, pre-workout meal.

Overall, DOPE. GO HERE."}
{"text":"Tapioca express has been my go to spot for years since discovering it in San Diego.  To me they've always had one of the best almond milk tea boba drinks and I can't get enough of their crispy chicken as well! One of the best combo snacks out there!"}
{"text":"Came here at 10 and it's closed... I don't know if this is Yelp's fault or the business's fault, but disappointed."}
{"text":"Okay place always order jasmine milk tea and always come out different either one time is too sweet , next time is either no flavor and just water down, one time is super bitter. Sometimes just perfect always made different ughhh"}
{"text":"I ordered a hazelnut milk tea with boba and boy was I surprised! It tastes like water with boba.
Combo yogurt frost lacked kiwi and overcompensated lack of flavor with sugar syrup. Highly disappointing for a tapioca Express and wouldn't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm really glad they opened this by the seafood city. I don't have to drive all the way to China town now! I always get boba milk tea and it was very good. I'm pretty picky about the chewiness of the boba pearls but I liked it a lot. One thing that sucks is to get it hot to go there is only one size cup. But other than that no complaints! Will definitely visit this place a lot (:"}
{"text":"Not terrible (as in, still better than some boba places) but definitely the worst Tapioca Express I have been to. I love TapEx in the Bay Area, and I used to go every week for boba and crispy calamari. The location here, while still providing solid tapioca pearls, fell short in customer service, efficiency, and final product. Really, the boba is the only reason to return.

Overall, they definitely still have some kinks to work out. They were unable to answer questions about their menu and told me they had no soy milk and could not add soy or milk to the tea I ordered; behind me, a customer with a diary allergy ordered a drink with soy. When her drink came, the employee said she didn't know what was in it and continued to tell me they didn't have soy. When someone has an allergy, this is just unsafe. 
Ultimately, it came down to her saying that they did have soy, but she refused to make mine with soy milk because she didn't think it would taste good. This, to me, seems ridiculous. 
Really, they retain their three stars because the boba was still delicious- chewy, flavorful, and good to the end of the drink. However, the crispy calamari took about 4-5 times longer than they said it would to make and instead of the flavorful, crispy batter I have grown to love at other locations, this had a heavy overcooked crunch. Knowing how good the product at other TapEx locations is, this was quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Staff is unorganized! The first experience is bad too, but I give them second chance. More worst ever. Wait for 50 minutes for my drink. I am not lying. Never coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"I was out and about and after spending the previous day looking at Boba tea joints on yelp, I did a quick search and decided to pay TE a visit.  We came in right before lunch time.  There was no one present and this allowed us time to check out the menu.  Oh how I wanted fries....but given I had brought my lunch to work, I did not want to ruin my appetite nor my lunch.  The lady behind the counter was friendly enough in explaining this and that.  I settled on the Melon Milk Boba Tea.  I watched as it was prepared with ease and the top of the cup was sealed with a layer of plastic in nifty fashion.  The first sip was cool, sweet and refreshing.  Remember...as your cup says....chew your Boba balls and don't swallow!!"}
{"text":"Was craving some boba after lunch so we checked the place out. Went with the jasmine milk tea with light boba and it was really sweet. The drink itself didn't blend too well. You couldn't really taste too much jasmine since the sugar overpowered everything. 
The boba wasn't the best I've tried, BUT it wasn't terrible. The boba throughout was consistent, but not that (freshly cooked boba) chewy. The price was fair and not overpriced. 
Couldn't dock too many stars since Jasmine Milk Tea was the only thing I tried, but I definitely won't try this place again...
The place itself was spacious and the service was quick."}
{"text":"I love their avocado snow bubble with boba and the spicy crispy chicken snack. Depending on who's working their customer service skills could use some work. Last time I went in I stood there about 3 minutes while the 2 workers were talking to each other and on their cell phones. Like really what if I was the owner walking in. Anyway I'll probably be back though when I have a craving."}
{"text":"I came to his place today at approximately 4:20pm because it was near seafood city and I was craving for some Thai tea. 

I came into the store, no acknowledgement from the cashier whatsoever. Customer service is bad and they don't serve water! What kind of establishment especially serving hot plate food not have drinking water? People who consume food and drink sweet drinks will be dehydrated and worst of all water is needed to flush down the excess regimen to digest properly. Beware, this place does not serve water! The Thai tea is good but the service could have been better."}
{"text":"Tasty and affordable. The crispy chicken rice place was awesome, and you get to pick how spicy you want it. The honeydew icy with boba was delicious and refreshing. Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I love their milk tea with boba! It's in an easy to find shopping center. I've always been able to get in and out easily without a wait."}
{"text":"I'm from California where there's a Tapioca Express everywhere! TapEx was the very first boba joint I ever went to as a child, so it awesome seeing one open up in vegas, super close to campus!! So convenient. Now I don't have to go all the way to China town went im craving for a boba fix! The reason for 4 stars is just that the milk tea from tapex was always mediocre, even in California. But it's great when you're craving!!"}
{"text":"This place wouldn't be able to stay open in Chinatown. I like that they're one of the few spots that offers the small boba, but if your tea is mediocre it doesn't really matter. I prefer my tea drinks on the less-sweet side and here it seems like everything is made to be a dessert, even if you don't order a snow drink. Multiple orders for less sweet and \"barely sweet at all\" did not seem to be heeded. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Good spot for boba but, seems like theyre always out of something
When I was here last week.. they were out of boba & now theyre out of bananas & squid balls lol"}
{"text":"Their jasmine milk tea is very flavorful, the most flavor in a green milk tea I've ever tasted and their boba's very soft and chewy. 

The longanisa fries are very good! As well as the fried squid balls! The matcha fried Oreos were decent, it was just normal fried oreos with a scoop of green tea ice cream in the middle. 

Plus, the drinks here are pretty cheap compared to where I'm coming from. Houston step it up."}
{"text":"I am a hugeeeeeeee fan for this Boba Place. I always go with my best friend and my Mom and I recently introduced it to my boyfriend and his Mother and they also love it. 
The service is nice, there are these two girls I always see when I go who are super nice. I've had other people attend me but they don't give the same awesome welcoming as the other two girls :) 
Totally my favorite place to go that hits the spot. They use real fruit and their yogurt is divine. I love it!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best place for boba. They have a wide selection of teas. Definitely should try this place out. The staff is really nice and friendly. Love it!"}
{"text":"I have tried this place once with my sister and her boyfriend. Sadly, I didn't have time to look at their menu for food. But I did order the Mango snow-globe with boba. I think that's what it is called. I like how their boba isn't hard but very chewy. The mango slush was very good, usually at other boba places you can't taste the mango but with this one you can."}
{"text":"Me and the hubby decided we wanted boba(random late night craving) so we yelped the place before leaving the house. On Yelp it said they close at midnight we were so excited they were open late YAYYY!!!! We live  on northwest part of Vegas a 20minute drive to Tapioca  Express guess what we get there and the place is CLOSED!!!!!!!!! Please change your hours  of operation because I wouldn't want this happen to other customers."}
{"text":"I order frost milk grass jelly, and there is no taste. I told the girl to add some brown sugar. Wait for 40 minutes for nothing. Never come back!!!!!!!! Very very very slow service. Bad experience, and food taste bad too. Worst!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't you love being greeted with a friendly smile! The staff definitely know what they're doing. Try their tapioca milk tea and fried Oreos! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped by because we were in the area. The drinks ended up being pretty good, however, I was a little turned off by the employee's lack of knowledge. 

Took us a while to order because we wanted our drinks unsweetened which seemed to confuse the cashier. He told us at first that none of the drinks could be unsweetened. When asked if he was sure, he turned to a random girl standing next to me and asked her. I'd imagine she probably had just gotten off work, but the whole process was just weird.

We finally asked which drinks could be made unsweetened since the drinks we had named weren't possible to be made without sugar...because I'm sure they use some kind of powder in most of their drinks...We ended up getting just plain milk tea and jasmine milk tea. In the end the drinks tasted good, but the whole process was just off-putting and a pain."}
{"text":"The drinks and the food is good but the service sucks big time. Especially the one girl thats working at the counter rudest bitch ever! She will literally looks at u up and down when u walk in like she owns the place."}
{"text":"First thing's first... The customer service needs a little working on. Sometimes I get greeted, other times I just get an awkward stare... The only thing that keeps me coming back is their Matcha Green tea Snow Bubble & accumulating stamps on my stamp card! 

When I heard TapEx opened here in my hood, I was excited and had gone 3-4 times a week for a good two weeks with my cousin. My cousin had her favorite, which was the yogurt smoothie/shake with fruit, and I had mine, the matcha green tea. Nothing stopped us from getting them, so we became loyal customers and still are. I am currently craving it as we speak. Darn it!!

I hope for more days filled with matcha green tea, and I hope I get the strength and courage to try something else on the menu soon! Tata for now!"}
{"text":"Huh.. never had a bubble tea I didn't like.. until today that is. I had a chance to try both the honey and the almond milk tea. They both tasted strongly of pre-made mix and not fresh at all, mind you I wouldn't count myself as overly picky either. Perhaps in the past this was the best you could get around here, but there are much better options within ~5 minutes of this place, and a metric ton of options if you're willing to go a little further into Chinatown. I did not try any snacks or food here so I can't comment on that. 

To their credit I did find the boba to be a nice consistency (soft but not soggy) and the people working there were polite and helpful."}
{"text":"Broke my heart three times in one visit.
First I walked in wanting something from the kitchen, kitchen was close. I get it, we came late, okay. Second, they didn't have the drink that I've gotten at several other locations, okay I suppose that's fine, every location is different I guess. And then after everything, and by the way, I've shown my credit card multiple times, I try to pay, and the girl FINALLY says their card reader isn't working! Hands down the WORST TapEx I've been to!!"}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service was poor. As a customer, I like to be greeted upon entry. I understand if theyre busy but we were the only people there and they were just talking. The cashier was very slow with our orders. We ordered boba and they overfilled our drink so much we couldnt move it without spilling. Our food took about 30 mins for it to come and we were confused because we didnt know if our food was ready or someone elses so we had to keep going back and forth. The only sense of relief was when we got our food."}
{"text":"Good boba and yummy fusion food.

I came here with my bf and our friends a couple days ago. It was a pleasant experience although our order took a little bit more than expected. Our friends have been here before and we were really inclined to try it. My bf and I ordered longanisa fries, taro milk tea with boba, and coffee with boba (the coffee wasn't that good). Everything tasted really flavorful and their boba was fresh. The atmosphere is clean and modern. I can't wait to come back and try something new."}
{"text":"There's been a lot of improvement since the last time I've came here. Very impressed with the changes and loved my short stop here."}
{"text":"If your in need of a quick boba fix, this is a good place to check out. 

I would recommend trying the avocado snow bubble with small tapioca and egg pudding. A deliciously sweet and creamy shake packed with fresh avocado. The egg pudding, reminds me of a Filipino desert called \"leche flan\" which was my favorite desert growing up and the small tapioca compliments the drink so well.

The cafe is located more central of Las Vegas and near the university, which is great for students and professors."}
{"text":"After my last experience probably will never come here  again staff was rude and my drinks were water down. Will definitely get boba else where"}
{"text":"Took me a while to go back to this place because the last time I came here I was given horrible service. The lady behind the register was not having it when I was simply asking questions about things in the menu. Also, last time I ordered one of their slushies and liquid came out of the cup and it was a huge mess because they over filled the cup and didn't close it securely. 

I was glad to get a nice lady this time. I got longanisa fries and it comes with black/green tea. I upgraded to a milk tea, and she made it pretty quickly. Both milk tea and fries were good. Next time I would call early if I wanted to get longanisa fries again cause it takes a while to make. 

It was also really weird that they were playing two different songs at the same time, kind of bothered me."}
{"text":"I stumbled onto this place, while I was waiting for a friend to get out of class at UNLV down the street, and I couldn't be any more glad my curiosity got the better of me to walk through the door. 

Service: semi-quick + super friendly

Yula, the cashier, was super nice and welcoming. She recommended some of her favorites on the menu, and convinced me to try the longanisa fries (filipino sausage that has a sweet savory taste) even with a prior disclaimer all warm foods take 15-20 minutes to be served which makes sense considering it's primarily a boba place. Anyways, I felt adventurous and also ordered the green tea kit kat with boba to tie me over to getting my meal. 

Food Quality: Crave-worthy !

It goes to show, good things came to those who wait, because I legit could marry the longanisa fries and my green tea kit kat with boba. The fact this place isn't more busy is a mystery, but it feels great to know I found another hidden gem in Vegas. 

Atmosphere: Calm + Quiet

Aside from the music playing in the dining room, it's mostly empty and quiet. It's ideal for studying and apparently you can use the wifi from Jason's Deli next door for free. 

Pricing: Decent + Worth It 

It's in what I consider the university zone, meaning close proximity to the upcoming but broke college students, and so pricing is pretty cheap to accommodate them as the majority of the people who come through here. I spent $15, and I was stuffed."}
{"text":"My siblings and I stumbled upon this place while roaming around Vegas. It was 110 or so degrees outside and we wanted a refreshment. Oh boy we were glad to be here. The place is quiet spacious for a boba place. I ordered a regular boba milk tea and so are my siblings. It was refreshing but overpriced. There is nothing special and memorable about it, but it did its job to make us cool down from the heat. They offer stamp card too so if you had 10 orders of drink then you can get 1 for free. They have samplers too so you can try it before ordering a drink. Overall, it is an OK place."}
{"text":"This place is conveniently close to UNLV if you don't want to drive far for boba and a quick simple meal next to Seafood City. I ordered the Sisig fries under Chief's combos. The egg on top was a little bit overcooked but I think that if you're lucky or remember to  remind the chef to make the yolk runny. It would've been really good. 

They'll ask you if you would like water, green tea, or black tea with your order as part of the combo. I ordered the green tea and the flavor was pretty strong and not too sweet. Also since the order was a combo, you do not get a stamp unless you order a drink separately. Other than that I feel that it was very fulfilling. If I got bored of carne asada fries from Roberto's, I would come here for they're Sisig fries again."}
{"text":"Just moved here from San Diego to Vegas and I'm so happy that they have tapioca express here!! I haven't tried all the places in Vegas yet but wish there was more than just 1 tapioca express here love this place!!! Especially the spicy chicken plate sooooo good!!! Customer service can be a bit dull but would come back for the food and drinks!!"}
{"text":"First time ever going to a Tapioca express. I know bubble tea and boba drinks pretty well (drink them all the time and make them as well). I ordered the milk tea, the hubby ordered a vietnamese coffee and one of our boys ordered the Ferrero rocher shake. All our drinks was good and tapioca was cooked perfectly.
I wished we had time and space in our stomach (we ate way too much while in Vegas) to try more of their drinks and menu items. They also serve Filipino inspired food here which I thought was pretty neat."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. 

They use no fruit and all ice and water. Very disappointed.

The girl at the register was nice but the drinks is terrible."}
{"text":"I normally enjoy this place but during my most recent visit they were out of most items in their menu. C'mon management, get your food and supply management under control!"}
{"text":"Tapioca Express is really great! The owner is Filipino so they have a lot of Filipino items on the menu. I really enjoy their variety of flavors. I personally enjoy their honey milk tea. My boyfriend usually gets the strawberry snow bubble it comes with fruit and yogurt. It tastes delicious! My father gets the avocado snow bubble which is a really popular drink. You can't go wrong going to tapioca express!"}
{"text":"I used to just get the boba slushies but decided to try the lychee green tea. It was awful. Their green tea is so low quality that no matter how much sugar they added, the bitterness still cut through. I would recommend driving a little farther and going to The Chewy Boba Company instead if you want green tea boba."}
{"text":"I'm a huge milk tea person but this milk tea was gross. I couldn't even finish it. The girl cashier had major attitude. Never coming back. My drink wasn't even cold. The only thing that was decent was the boba"}
{"text":"The workers was very friendly. They gave a lot of boba which was kind of awesome because the ones I've been to were very stingy with the amount of tapioca that they put in.  I got the taro milm tea; it was really good. Will definitely go here again when I go vegas."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good I love their food choices there yummy :) however the honeydew milk tea was not the business for me . I do appreciate how they make it fresh though along with other selections . the crispy chicken is awesome!"}
{"text":"FINALLY is all I can say. I loved going to this place since I lived in Cali and the boba places just weren't as good here in Vegas. Finally, they have one here! Good service and good food too. Definitely gonna be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Didn't make my order after we paid.  I guess at 6 foot 3 I'm easy to forget standing there waiting..."}
{"text":"this place is the best! they also use fresh fruits. I always get the avocado boba. I live in the West side and go all the way here to get the avocado boba. their sisig fries or with rice is the best! I just wish they have more locations. MORE LOCATIONS"}
{"text":"Clean and newer store.   Really did not like the fact that there is a credit card minimum purchase amount that is higher than just buying one large boba drink.   Also their nondairy choices are very limited.    The boba itself is really good consistency, but the convenience factors for this store really lacked.   I most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Been here for about 15 mins. And at least they can do is give me my drinks.  Good thing the food is good and worth the wait."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what happened. But when they first opened, everything was on point. I don't know if it's the new employees that messes up the order. I am a big fan of Tapioca Express, until they constantly kept messing up my order. I would always order jasmine green tea with my combo and there was a sweetness to it. Lately, every time I order it tastes bitter and disgusting. It tastes like medicine. I kindly ask if they accidentally give me black tea, but they said no. It was green tea. This happened to me twice. I used to order this drink a lot so I know how it tastes. In addition to that, their customer service became weak. They don't seem to welcome you. The first time I came in, the guys were very welcoming. This time, the girls pretty much wanted to get their shifts over when they took orders."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, & this time my boba slush didn't come out right, which was made by Stefanie. My bf and I both said something to them about it & Stefanie claimed to have put a whole avocado.. Regardless of a whole avocado, you could've possibly added too much milk? Powder? Ice? Something. What happened to customer is always right? (LOL) I mean, I've been to many other boba spots and they've messed up a few times,& I would ask to get a new one made, & they would. Obviously if I'm paying for an almost $5 drink, wouldn't you think I'd want it made the right way? DUH. Whatever, other than that, I guess the  crispy chicken makes up for it."}
{"text":"It might be my first check in but I've been here three times already. This time I brought my boyfriend with me.

They have a wide range of flavors when it comes to milktea, tea or snow bubble (my personal favorite). Lychee is usually my go to flavor but I have also tried their passion fruit which was delicious. They can also mix flavors for you like caramel thai tea snow bubble that my boyfriend asked for. 

The staff is super friendly and easy to talk to. The price is very reasonable. You get a drink for under $5! 

Overall, this spot definitely satisfies my boba cravings:)"}
{"text":"I've only been here one other time but I don't really remember my experience other than all of the food tastes the same because they use the same spice seasoning LOL. 

I was craving some boba shop type greasy food so I was excited to come here. On my visit this time, I ordered the crispy chicken rice (extra spicy). It comes with green tea, black tea or water. It can be a shareable portion depending on how hungry you are. I also ordered the taro milk tea which was surprising good. I was expecting some meh-whatever-powdery type drink. But it was actually really creamy and not too sweet."}
{"text":"I write this review as a former employee and fan of original Tapioca Express franchises back in Cali. 

Sure this place had the logo and menu, but unfortunately falls far short of my expectations for a Tapioca Express, quality and customer service wise. 

Customer service is atrocious by my standards. I've felt like I'm more nuisance than welcome on the few times I've been here. Also, when ordering for take out, check for straws because they've never put straws in there for me.

Drink quality, I notice that their blended drinks always have bubble caps rather than the sealed lid. Big no no on drink quality based on the measurements used to make blended drinks. If you have that much extra product after blending a drink, I guarantee you added way too much ice and your drink will taste watered down. 

2 stars for the boba consistency, food, and nostalgia, but this is not the Tapioca Express I'm used to. 

If you still want to check it out, try the squid balls and anything with their fries  (though be ready for oil). Everything else is pretty average and you can do better at other boba shops in the Vegas Valley."}
{"text":"I am still jumping with joy that there is a tap ex in Vegas! 

Walked in and was greeted immediately (unlike the location in Cali) and since I already knew the menu, I got my order in quickly. 

I ordered: 
Xxtra spicy chicken (snack order) - I wish it was really spicy, I am use to it burning my lips spicy but this just had a dash, yes a dash, of spice. They gave me a decent portion too. 
Mango Icy w/ Boba and Mango Jelly - it didn't taste like mango and it was too much on the sweet side. I had a ton of tapioca but not enough jelly :( plus their boba was TOO chewy and soft. 
**Buy one Large Drink get one free Taro Milk Tea - first time having it and it was DELISH. I thought it would taste rubbery or plant like but hey, something I didn't pay for came out delicious ; ) 

Three stars to the quick and friendly service. Also to the Taro drink!"}
{"text":"I love Tap Ex! It has a special place in my heart since I used to work for one in California. I always get whatever flavor milk tea I'm feeling that day and the yummy crispy chicken, but...

$.55 for extra sauce. Those cups are only filled halfway. Maybe if they actually gave full cups I wouldn't need an extra one?

Other than that, all good."}
{"text":"Great to finally have a Tapioca Express outside of California. I have had it a few times and happy they opened up a location in Las Vegas. To add to that a good boba place on the east side of town! I came in on Monday night and there were a few patrons, I usually don't get too adventurous but how risky can you get considering it's a boba place? I must add though I hate when I try something out of the norm and am not satisfied. So I went ahead and order the hazelnut snow because I wanted it ice blended. Mmm, mmm! It sure was delicious. I'm glad they were able to execute the good taste of the drink just like California locations do. I notice when something is popular in California and then comes to Vegas it is just not as good. Thankfully this Tapioca Express did not disappoint! Their POS card system was not working that night and I only had my card on me so it left them no choice but to give me the drink on the house. I was certainly thankful for that and a reason I am writing them a review. Since the POS card system wasn't working the service was a tad bit slow, but I could tell the employees were doing what they could to get through their processes faster. The inside is of course new, which nice clean and somewhat modern touches. Tapioca Express is definitely my new boba spot in town!"}
{"text":"Great spot for studying or get some work done.  It has outlets and was very spacious.  This is one of my favorite spots to get crispy chicken snack. 

There is a self serve water pot which is a big plus. I don't like bothering busy workers for water.  

The parking lot is only 30-60 min parking. If you wanna stay longer, use the unlimited underground parking."}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment, I didn't really care for their boba. They also took a long time to make the fried calamari. Won't go back even though it is near UNLV."}
{"text":"Being a full-time college student, I'm always on a hunt for a study spot with good drinks and food. Tapioca Express is conveniently located by UNLV, and its ample parking, wide selection of food and drinks along with lots of tables to study makes for my ideal study spot. Unfortunately, the quality of their drinks and customer service seems to be going downhill and I have been disappointed lately. 

SERVICE
First off, some girls here got major attitude. I am a huge fan of milk teas and have tried many of the milk teas here. My most favorite (and sadly one and only drink I like from here) is their oolong milk tea. The problem is...they've been out of oolong tea for what feels like an eternity. Probably ever since dinosaurs existed. Too long!

Back in May, I kindly asked one of the girl if they have oolong tea back and she goes \"Ooohhh, we are probably not getting it back for a loooong loooooooong time\" with rude and snarky attitude. It made me want to choke on boba and walk out of here. She could've apologized for the shortage or at least be a little bit more professional.

I have also overheard these servers talking smack about customers. Unprofessionalism at its finest.

DRINKS
As stated above, I only like oolong milk tea here. It is one and only milk teas here that you can actually taste the tea. Their black milk tea is extremely sweet and taste very artificial. Not even a slightest taste of tea. Jasmine milk tea is ok, has a really distinct and weird taste that I am not a fan of. Other milk teas taste artificial as well, like it is made from powder and syrups.

I do enjoy the boba here. Has the perfect texture every visit. I also got to try their mini boba for the very first time. Personally not a fan but a lot of people seems to enjoy it. 

CONCLUSION
Oolong milk tea seems to be the only thing worth coming to this place but they've been out for a while...I can't speak for other drinks such as slushes or flavored teas since I have yet to try them but I am not sure if I want to deal with the servers here."}
{"text":"I don't mind boba/bubble tea but since it's often laden with sugar I tend to stay away from it.  Tapioca Express isn't bad at all, it is a different boba from the norm.

What I like about Tapioca Express is not only do you have drinks, but they have a selective menu of finger foods too!  Almost like a little bistro type atmosphere.  But honestly we stopped by here after a HUGE meal in Seafood City consisting of goodies from Grill City & Crispy Town.  I was already stuffed!  But the kid wanted a sweet drink to wash it all down.  Nothing like spending $5 on copious amounts of sugar water!  Oh, and tapioca balls.

I'll give them this, their boba is smaller in size that just about all other places, making it much easier to drink through a smaller straw.  But I dunno, I'm just not all that into boba anymore!  I've done enough tapioca ball chewin' to gain myself like 5 pounds back then.  I drop all that sugar & starch...I drop weight.  Plus I'm not on a sugar high!  I just go back to sugar-free Red Bull or Monster when I have to ha ha ha!

I don't remember what flavor boba smoothie we got, but I'm pretty sure one of the flavors was ube.  We halved it with another flavor.  I took a few sips.  Smoothie had good consistency, almost like a Slurpee & the boba was chewy but not too chewy.  Kid liked it, I thought it was OK.  Nothing I'm gonna drive all the way across town for.  Like spending money on some hipster drinks?  Go to Tapioca Express!  Yes...at the time there were also hipsters hanging out.

But I may have to go back to try some of the food on their menu, looks tasty!  Boy do I have a hard time resisting them croquettes...

{"text":"I'm pretty familiar with TapEx back in my hometown so I was excited to see this place open up so close to me! 

But this franchise, like most people mentioned, isn't quite similar to its Californian counterparts. They offer similar drinks but they cater to more of Filipino food aficionados, compared to the Taiwanese snacks that are found elsewhere. With longanisa fries and sisig, I'm not complaining. 

The drinks are not bad but not that great. I like being able to taste the tea in my milk tea but unfortunately of the drinks I've tried, they're either too milky or watered down. HOWEVER, I do recommend asking for your milk tea to be \"blended.\" Basically where they ice blend your milk tea into sort of a smoothie. It tastes great and it's the easiest way to cool you down on a hot day! 

Overall, it's OooOoookay. Would probably come back just because of the space they offer to do work."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of this place, the service isn't good (the cashier had a terrible attitude) and the boba itself was terrible. I couldn't even finish a small because of how overwhelming the taste was. I ordered the passion fruit boba and it was as if they had just dumped the whole container of passion fruit flavoring into the drink. There was no balance in the drink. Not my first option for a drink of this kind. Do not go, I can think of many of other places better than this."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better boba drinks that I have had in Las Vegas.  Good flavor and blended ice.  The boba itself was a little on the soft side, however, still acceptable.

I did feel like I was nickeled and dimed a little.  I ordered a \"snow bubble\", which I had assumed included boba because of the the word, \"bubble\" was included in the name, instead I had to pay more to get boba."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's so convenient if you're a student because it's so close to campus. Their drinks taste great and they have a variety of flavors! The fries they offer too are very tasty. Their longanisa and sisig fries are personal favorites. Their jasmine green tea is also a great drink. I would give five stars if it wasn't for one of their workers, Steffany though. She's not exactly nice or welcoming to customers such as to my friends and I. She acted rude if you didn't exactly know your order and if you asked too many questions. But other than that, the place is great!"}
{"text":"The gospel of small tapioca pearls, according to Chris V.

In the beginning, there was bubble tea. The masses tried the sweet drink and chewed thoughtfully on the tapioca pearls. And they saw that it was good.

The drink spread throughout Taiwan, and then across the ocean to America. So it came to pass that this beverage would build a devoted following.

Most establishments that served this beverage utilized large tapioca pearls. Giant straws that could convey the pearls were necessary. Many would enjoy the novelty of these tools.

But some people would feel that these unwieldy instruments forced them to consume the drink far too quickly. They did not like this, nor did they entirely appreciate the alternative of simply not ordering the chewy boba.

Some practitioners of the art turned to small tapioca pearls, rumored to be the original form used in the creation of bubble tea. They found a similar chewy texture that could be enjoyed through a regular, smaller straw. And with that straw, they would finally be able to sip their drink slowly.

Unfortunately, not all vendors would embrace small tapioca. Even in such locations as San Jose and Orange County, these providers appeared to be few and far between.

Lo and behold, the small tapioca pearls have finally been brought to the great desert oasis known as Las Vegas. Whereas other businesses have ignored the allure of \"mini boba,\" one franchise of the chain called Tapioca Express (not known universally for this particular add-on) finally unveiled this option.

On the 11th day of the 5th month in the year of our Lord [that's literally A.D.] 2015, I arrived at this first Tapioca Express of Las Vegas, and I found the small tapioca that I had only previously witnessed in the land of California.

Although TapEx's standard milk tea ($2.98, +$0.50 for large size) is prepared from a product that is markedly sweet, an employee did indicate that they can adjust the sugar levels of certain flavored teas. This brings significant hope for the future.

Regardless, if the burden of an overly sweet milk tea must be weighed against the beauty of small pearls (+$0.50 per topping), I will cheerfully choose their small pearls because they are properly chewy and do not clump.

So come all ye boba lovers, and try the small tapioca! See what you've been missing all along."}
{"text":"I wish I could leave zeros stars. The girl that was working had terrible service and wouldn't allow me to add $0.50 boba because I only had a credit card and they have a spending limit."}
{"text":"I'm from the Bay area and having a Tapex here in Vegas is one of the best things to ever happen! (not really, but you get the point)

My cousin and I came here to check it out with already high standards of how things should be. It is located right next to Jason's Deli, Wingstop, and Seafood City (Asian central, basically). Service was on par. It was quick and the girl who took our orders was very friendly and helpful. We ended up ordering the Halo Halo and Avocado snow bubble. I'm not sure why people weren't able to taste the avocado in theirs. We tasted ours and saw the lady use real avocados to make them! We also decided to order the Matcha fried Oreos. It was served with 4 Oreos and a scoop of vanilla ice cream in the middle. They were good, but nothing special, especially since I didn't taste the matcha that much. However, it didn't meet our standards and while the food and drinks were good, it wasn't anything spectacular.

Seating is plenty and it's very spacious and clean here. I'm glad it isn't as cramped and dirty as some other boba places, like Tea Station or Volcano Tea in Chinatown.

Overall, I'm a fan and I would return. This is one of the better boba places here in Vegas, and I'm so happy to finally have a Tapex in town!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy that they finally have Tapioca Express here in Vegas! For now, I ordered their Iced Milk Tea w/ boba and I love it! Their milk tea's not too sweet, it's not plain either. The boba's perfect and it's cheap! Service was fast, I got my order probably less than a minute after I paid, which was good. I'll definitely come back. Highly suggest to come and try tapioca express if you want some great boba drinks! (They also have combo meals like crispy chicken rice, sausage rice, etc!)"}
{"text":"First time coming here. Needed a boba fix and I live by the area so I gave it a try. 

To be honest the only reason I'd come back here is for the chi chi fries or the longanesa fries. Today I had the chi chi fries and they're pretty bomb! It's very good! Served fresh and suuuper cheesy. It's a very nice alternative to some carne Assad fries. Lol. There's also lots of spice and you can choose your heat level. 

Aside from the fries I got a milk tea boba and it's kind of meh. I've had better milk read somewhere else. My tea still had chunks of powder so it wasn't very pleasing. Prices are a little too much for the size. Boba has a nice consistency though. 

I don't think you should stray away from this place. It's an okay place for the fries but other than that the boba is kind of boring."}
{"text":"No, thank you! I stopped by a few days ago to try it out. I had their taro icee which wasn't icy in the least. It was tasteless and watered down very badly. Not to mention, as i was looking for what i wanted, i took a step back and was sighed at and stared down by the employee while making up my mind.
I think the final 'nope' for me was tonight when i went in. The same situation- stared at impatiently as i tried to make my mind up (keep in mind i was stepped back- not in line). I ordered and went to pay and the girl stopped me and said the card has a minimum charge of $5. I told her i didn't have cash on me (which a usual merchant would then typically accept the card as the minimum card shouldn't be the condition of the sale). She shrugged her shoulders and just looked at me...
What. A Bitch. Not going back here again. Walked out, my boyfriend offered to add more on just to meet the $5 minimum but i was gone by her disgusting attitude. Not coming here again."}
{"text":"This Tapex is has incorporated a Filipino fusion touch in their menu, which was very interesting. I ordered the green tea kit kat (~$4.50), which is similar to a matcha green tea smoothie. It was tasty, but I love all things green tea. My friend ordered the sisig fries, which was yummy. All of their fried foods smelled delicious though, but I was too full to order food."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! It was the first place I was exposed to Boba, and has been pretty consistently my go to place for a good one. The yogurt frost is amazing! 

I will say, their employees are generally not super friendly, or maybe they're just stand offish? I'm not really sure. They make a great boba though, and that's the only thing I come here for!"}
{"text":"Given that T.E is a chain, you expect some level of uniformity. This Tapioca Express left a lot to be desired.

My normal go to snack at Tapioca Express is the crispy chicken with fried basil...this location indicated that they don't make theirs with basil...that was a huge bummer! Then adding insult to injury they sugared my hot jasmine tea! 

All in all, this was closer to yucky than yummy"}
{"text":"First time here, TERRIBLE! They lists about 120 item on the menu but only 7% are available. LOL SHUT IT DOWN! Reason was for renovation? WTHeck. They honestly shouldn't open to begin with such a waste of time. Probably renovation due failed health inspection, typical Filipino food joint. Decent service from the cashier lady though."}
{"text":"Needed a drink on a hot day.  Saw Tapioca Express but I didn't have yelp to see the reviews so I gave it a shot.  I was surprised at the many type of drinks they offer. Even more surprised that they offered food like sisig fries, egg roll, and desserts. I got the peppermint chocolate with soy milk and boba. It was delightfully refreshing. Definetly need to give it a shot again for the food."}
{"text":"My favorite drinks to order are the honeydew milk tea and passion fruit snowbubble! Tapioca express was my go to boba spot while I was still living in California. The drinks are always consistent and they're not overpriced! I currently live in the Summerlin area and don't mind the drive at all despite the area it's in lol."}
{"text":"Went in on a Monday afternoon around 1:00 pm. It was my first time going so I was undecided as what to get, I recently have become obsessed with boba, so I was super excited to try tapioca express. Bonus points that it is in walking distance of where I live. I entered the restaurant and was warmly greeted by a girl working the counter. I decided to try something relatively plain, so I got the jade green milk tea with boba and I also tried the spicy buffalo chicken fries. As soon as I got home I tore into my bag because the fries smelled sooooo delicious. The fries were crisp and delicious, the chicken had a little bit of gristle, but overall very good. As for the tea, that was very good as well, the boba was cooked perfectly, not to chewy but not hard either. Definitely will he going back."}
{"text":"The sisig fries were life-changing. I tried this place on a whim and am not disappointed. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We had a midday snack Saturday 03/07/15. I had the red bean frosti milk with pudding and boba. I have to say I enjoyed it. It was very tasty. I did not mix the drink at first so I got all boba and pudding. Very tasty, so I started mixing and it was red bean, pudding and boba all together. It tasted even better. Service was great. The longanisa fries were very good but I was stuffed after a couple bites."}
{"text":"This TapEx provides a nice place to study, the room room is spacious and mostly quiet. It is never too crowded because they do a lot of grab and goes.

This particular TapEx includes a lot of fusion Filipino delicacies such as Sisig Fries and Filipino variations on American snacks. So aside from your typical boba favorites, you can also get a quick meal here if you choose to.

My favorites at Tap Ex: Thai Tea Snow Bubbles, which is pretty much a Thai Tea flavored slushie, perfect for a hot day. I also like their french fries because they sprinkle the Asian spiced seasoning on it.

This place is not the place for super good boba, but they definitely get the job done and offers a variation to a cafe type setting."}
{"text":"Love love their avocado snow bubble and taro milk tea! Friendly staff and clean place!"}
{"text":"This is one of my least favorite boba spot that I have tried. It is located in the very busy plaza of Seafood City and is quite spacious. I decided to give this place a try as my friend was in the need of boba tea. Upon entering, I was greeted right away by a friendly and cheerful employee. She explained to me that what makes them stand out is that they have two sizes of bobas. They have the smaller size \"pearls\" which a regular straw would accomadate and the bigger (more common) \"pearls\", in which the fat straws are needed. 

I decided to go with the bigger size boba since the smaller ones were not availble at the time.  I'm guessing it was because I came right when they opened so maybe they didn't get to make it yet? Nonetheless, I went with the taro flavor in the larger of the two sizes they offer. 

Order came up fast and I was on my way eager to see if I found a new spot for boba with my friend. The flavor of taro was very artificial and powdery. The drink was cloyingly sweet-even for me who would be Mayor of Sugar City if they had an election. Texture of the boba was ok, but had zero flavor. All in all, I'm giving the stars for the friendly service and the place being clean, but I did not become a fan of the boba drink here. However, you can check it out for yourself of course."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out and chill out. drinks are amazingly good. Almond snow bubble! Yum! Good!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Sometimes the wait is a little long but the drinks are worth it. Tried the longanisa fries and enjoyed those as well :) I've had the mango black tea, taro snow bubble and the coconut snow bubble so far. Also love the fact that they offer soy milk as an option. Would recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Great selection of tea and coffee. Very friendly staff. Love the green tea kit kat with boba. Ask about the drinks on the secret menu."}
{"text":"Who loves bubble tea?! If you answered you then you're awesome! If you answered me you're right! I do. I knew this place was opening and since I'm a bobaholic why the heck not?!

I had a busy day at work last week and decided a bubble tea might make my day a little better and I stopped by on my lunch. Bad Idea. Short ribs took a while to prepare. I guess that's a good thing they were piping hot and succulent. Could have been slightly more tender but for a bubble tea place not bad at all. The garlic rice wasn't very garlicky. Which is funny because the manager asked if I wanted garlic rice and I said ok! Then he says its a really good garlic rice. He lied :/. 

The milk tea I ordered came with the combo I ordered a regular and they gave me a large. They charged me wrong and undercharged me and I told the cashier and they said not to worry about it because they couldn't figure out how to do it in their new registers as the place had only been open a few days. 

The royal milk tea itself was pretty good. Not my favorite I've had but not bad. The boba was the standard soft slightly mushy boba you find pretty much everywhere besides KFT. I love KFT but no one makes their boba like them. I think everyone should get in on the secret because it has amazing texture and flavor. 

Service was great here the first time. Second time it was ok. Not as good as the first time. My second visit I came today and we ordered a Thai tea and a taro slush without boba. The Thai tea tasted too strong and was undrinkable IMO. The taro slush was pretty good but again I think KFT is killing the boba and taro slush game. Overall this is an ok option if you're not willing to drive all the way to Chinatown.  I can see this place as a chill spot to study or chill with drinks and grab a drink. Just steer clear of the Thai tea."}
{"text":"Tapioca Express reminds me of my youth. Back in 2002 my love affair with boba drinks began. In Cali, TapEx was thee shhhhhit. Pretty much the gold standard for boba drinks at the time. That was the life, listening to Beyonce's crazy in love, sippin' on some boba, chatting on AIM, while downloading illegal music...and no adult responsibilities. 

Anywho, Vegas finally has TapEx as of last year?! Still the same! In a good way. It's a solid chain. Can't complain. Service is always so-so. 

TapEx is still cool because they are the only ones in town that have hazelnut snow bubble, mini boba, and decent spicy popcorn chicken! 

The overall space inside is great. For a boba shop, plenty of seating! 

Who is in the mood for a sugar high? TapEx advertises drink specials like: green tea kit kat, ferrero rocher, and tareo (taro+oreo?!). TapEx also offers more food items than other places, including some Filipino inspired dishes. 

Side notes: 
- I only order two things: caramel or hazelnut snow bubble. Same thing forever. It's good and comforting. Not mind blowing.

- I have tried: earl grey milk tea. Not impressed. Actually, I dislike their milk teas here. 

This is one of those places that I don't make a special trip for. That means only if I am in the area shopping for Asian groceries lol."}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 49/100***

On my way to work the mood struck me and I wanted boba stat! I remember seeing a boba place right next to Wingstop on Maryland Parkway, Tapioca Express that's what it was! The place was deserted when I got there at 10:35 which worked out for me since I was pressed for time. I was set in getting Oolong milk tea with boba but was quickly brought down from that fantasy to be told they were out of Oolong and Earl grey. WHAT?!?!?! How the heck could you be out of things already when you've opened barely 30 minutes ago? Nothing else appealed to me so I decided on my default flavor - Matcha Snow bubble. Regular size is $3.98 and large is $4.98
I was disappointed as I had my heart set on the milk tea but the Matcha was quite tasty with prominent tea flavor so that was its saving grace. The boba was too soft and mush like for my taste but I noticed it got better the longer it sat. I'll be back and hopefully this time they wont go breaking my heart LOL."}
{"text":"I agree that the customer service needs some work. I ordered a green ice tea and they didn't tell me it was going to take longer to make then the others so I sat around waiting for it. Until I asked them how much longer for my drink, then they barely tell me it's going to take awhile to make. Should've told me some time sooner rather than after 15 minutes when I ask them about it. 

The manager was nice though and let me get something else off the menu. When I asked one of the workers there would be a snow bubble be faster than a tea she answered it's the same, obviously it is not if I never even got the tea. 

Oh and the girl making my drink damaged my lid and didn't even bother replacing it. Only giving it 2 stars because the manager was nice."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. This tapioca express is so much better than the ones we have in so cal. I found the menu to be a bit different since there were a lot of filipino items on it. Regardless of ownership, whatever they put in thei \"crisp chicken AKA popcorn chicken,\" is like crack. The price is reasonable and the portion is bigger than the ones back home. My husband is very skeptical on different popcorn chicken places and always has me just order one when it is our first time. After he tried a bite, he was sure to stamp this popcorn chicken five stars. I ended up ordering another one with rice...my goodness, just when I didn't think this chicken could get any better, there was white rice. 

Besides the awesome popcorn chicken, I also ordered fresh watermelon juice which was superb for the price and fresh. Needless to say, I will be visiting when I am next in town.

*clean place
*fast service
*fresh food

{"text":"I love that it's so close to Seafood City! The boba/tapioca here has got to be my favorite in all the places I have tried so far. The consistency is very soft. It is very empty a lot of times, usually because people do pickups. The fried calamari is tasty! The drinks are great, the atmosphere is standard."}
{"text":"I was able to leave UNLV just in time to stop by here! I wanted to try the hot & new Chewy Boba spot by missed it by half an hour. I use to be such a fan of Tapioca Express growing up when going to the Bobulard Mall was the thing to do and the middle of the food court had Tapioca Express kiosk! The good ole days when your only concerns as a teen are what your next outfit is and what spot to eat at at the food court while you're at the mall! 

I initially came here to get Thai Ice Tea with BOBA because Lotus of Siam doesn't carry boba.  That's where I was picking dinner up. I love the consistency of their drinks! Regardless of location your drink will always taste as good as your first day. Also, when your traveling from UNLV to Northwest their spill proof sealed cups are great. I prefer coming here instead of my other usual Boba spot Tea Station because although they're both busy Tapioca Express always serves you in a timely manner. Although the customer service can improve if your in the mood for a delicious cold or hot drink then stop by! The prices are fair game as well! They had some fun facts about Tapioca Pearls that I snapped a photo of! 

The boba is prepared just right not soggy or extra slimy!"}
{"text":"So ive been here a few times now and the greatest thing about this place is the boba and the different toppings.. i love that they have small size boba but the only thing is that the smoothies and drinks are inconsistent it just depends on who is making them which is the reason this place is not on the top of my list. I will leave this review on a good note and say that they have Sisig Fries ( crispy pork belly fries) which are pretty good they are topped with cheese, sour cream, crispy pork belly and an egg on top."}

I went on Opening Day 4pm. I dont like how the interior lacks light while the giant row of windows let sunlight beam through with an ugly, migraine-promoting ray. It ruins the true beauty of the interior design. Also, they were out of stuff or said that things weren't on the menu even though it WAS on the menu. They should have been a little more prepared and revised. The cashier speaks WAY TOO SOFT. my friend i were both at the counter, BOTH leaning in forward with our ear facing her, BOTH obviously in a \"i cant hear you\" pose and the cashier did NOT bother to meet us halfway by raising her voice. Like really now? She shouldnt be in the cashier position. i hope she didnt make things harder for the customers who actually were LEGIT hard-of-hearing!"}
{"text":"Anak, uminom tayo ng Tsaa na may sago-(my child, let's drink Boba Tea). On a recent shopping trip with my parents and tita(aunt) in this busy shopping plaza anchored with Seafood City. It's not hard to missed a Boba Tea shop near Las Vegas default Filipino town, which is one reason why this place gets a decent amount of customers and not much competition in the area. The majority Filipino staff is very friendly and helpful. However, the flavor of the actual milk teas were ok plus they don't have the option to adjust sweetness level. I prefer my drinks less sweet so I'm able to taste all components of my drink. I do like the option that they have two sizes of Boba, regular and small. 

The shop is much larger than others in town, makes it an ideal place to hangout with a group of friends or family. Plus, they have various Meriendas (snacks) that have a Filipino twist.

2017 Yelp Review #72"}
{"text":"I was super excited to see this tapioca chain open up. sadly I got a little too excited haha this shop is a lot smaller in terms of menu.

The milk tea and Jasmine milk tea taste about the same from California, but other drinks - my fave, lavender milk tea/snow bubble is unavailable. The papers menus where the cash register are, are unreliable because they have items listed (like lavender milk tea) but don't actually have them as a product in store: they use menus from other stores as references haha so just rely on the menu board in store.

decent popcorn chicken in Las Vegas but found something in my popcorn chicken today (not my first time to order it) 

they stopped having stamp cards also. I had one stamp remaining and then would get a free one - the only reason I came lol

2.5 stars rounding up but the popcorn chicken will satisfy you, milk tea - eh, skip."}
{"text":"My BF and I stopped here just to get a boba drink, but we ended up eating here. It was delicious!!! The owner gave us free crispy chicken and heck, it was so good we decided to eat here. On top of that, ordered crispy chicken again (rice) and sisig rice as well :) The food was not oily at all, for it to be fried. The place was clean, the workers were nice, and the food was delicious!! Definitely deserves 5 stars!!!"}

{"text":"One more star for the sisig fries, tho! This place has gotten better. Except the girls who work there are always so rude every single time I go there. It literally never fails. They aren't welcoming and they always seem impatient to get the transaction over and done with. 

I'm not there for them, though. I just want my boba and sisig fries or mild crispy chicken."}
{"text":"This is my place!! So good and so convenient for us UNLV students and boulevard mall employees. Cappuccino Snow Bubbles are my fave!"}
{"text":"Went 9-10-15 around 6PM cuz' I was craving boba! 

 $11.60 got me some chicken fries and a large jasmine tea with boba. 

The fries were great...hot and crispy.  They were topped with some delicious popcorn-sized pieces of fried chicken, cheese, and some kind of sauce.  You can choose your level of spicy. 

Years ago, Banquet made these fried, breaded, barbecue chicken wings that were outta this world good and I was on a perpetual search for them until I found out they don't make them anymore.  The chicken on these fries tasted exactly like the Banquet chicken.  I was in heaven. The cashier said it comes with water or plain tea unless you want to upgrade to a fancy-schmancy drink.  

The jasmine tea....meh.  I'm kind of a beginner in the world of boba but every other jasmine tea I've had from different places came already sweetened.  The milk tea here did not.  Note to self....next time ask for some Splenda.  By the time I got it home the milk was curdling and separating from the tea.  It still tasted fine, though.  But the boba was reaaaaal mushy-there was no texture left to it.  Kinda turned me off.  

Pretty neat place...can't wait to take my husband here!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite boba places in town.. I absolutely love the snow bubble texture and the many flavors they have.. The place is really clean..  I come here often with either my boyfriend or my mom and I've yet to have a bad experience. Workers are pretty friendly and helpful too if you're looking to experiment with a new flavor or mixture of any drink."}
{"text":"I just love how convenient this place is and how close it is to UNLV. I've been here a number of times and each visit did not disappoint!

When you walk in, you'll notice how spacious this place is and how clean it is. When you go to the register, you'll notice a little black board filled with daily specialty drinks. When I went, they had captain crunch and nerds added to their board. Seemed very interesting to try later on. 

I always, ALWAYS, always order the cantaloupe smoothie here. It is to die for if you're a big fan of cantaloupe. Their coconut and yogurt drinks are amazing as well, but I stuck with my usual and ordered the cantaloupe smoothie. Since I was also hungry, what better way to pair it off with the crispy chicken rice plate (extra spicy please!). I always have the hardest time choosing between the crispy chicken rice and the longanisa fries because they're both so yummy! 
Such deliciousness in my mouth. 

Food:
The crispy chicken rice plate consists of:
Chicken,steamed veggies, two scoops of rice, and an egg to top it all off. (Very filling)

This will always be one of my go to spots if I'm craving cantaloupe or near school. The workers have always been consistent with their service, food, and drinks. Will definitely see this place again sometime soon since I'm craving cantaloupe again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to TapEx! They always have fun people working. I really like the employees named Ryan and Tiani. They're super nice and always smiling! They suggest good stuff too and now my favorite that I'm always craving is the chocolate bubble! TapEx also has this thing where you can do a drink upgrade, for cheap! Awesome. I love their longanisa fries, the sauce (or whatever they put on it) is SO GOOD! Definitely love coming here whenever I have a boba craving. MMM!"}
