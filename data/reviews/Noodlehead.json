{"text":"We had a solid experience here- the food was a great price, the atmosphere is great, loved the decor & I'm a fan of a simple menu. Our waitress was nice & informative but unfortunately the fact that no one at our table could enjoy their meal because of the spice level was a little bit of a damper. We all like spicy food and ordered 1's & 2's on a scale of 5 but our food was literally covered in red-pepper flakes :(  Again, I'm no wimp to spice- I'm the girl who is usually dumping tabasco on my food but this was a whole other story. 

We will give it another shot because it really is a neat little spot and what we could taste of the food was definitely solid."}
{"text":"One of the best placed in Shadyside I think. It's not the most glamorous place but the food is really done well for what it is. It actually tastes pretty authentic compared to others in the area and is spiced well. Reminds me alt of some of the street style Thai places in LA. Every noodle dish I've had had been very good. If you choose hot they actually make it hot. The pork buns are really tasty. Has a cool vibe and its byob!"}
{"text":"Got take out tonight. Trust me when I say Level 1 spicy is pretty damn spicy. Had the Street Noodle 2. Good choice. VERY limited menu. Don't go expecting to peruse lots of options. CASH ONLY. Good service."}
{"text":"I will be back to this place again...
1. Food was really good and the price is amazing for the value
2. The service was friendly, speedy and attentive - considering the food was so good, the service could have been half-hearted and I would still consider the place to be a great place to eat.
3. The atmosphere of the place was nice - nothing fancy - contemporary but with some unique feature
4. BYOB"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place, and I have been a bunch of times!  Great service, and I highly recommend the pork buns as an app!  The street noodles are great, however the chicken tends to be a little fatty.  It is cash only, but they DO have an ATM on premises. Great atmosphere and BYOB! Fun times!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is spicy! I usually get their lowest spicy level or one level up, and it ends up being just right for me. Anything more, and I start sweating bullets and chugging water. I've tried 4 different noodles from here and have loved every single one. I would love the dishes even more if they weren't as sweet (I think they add a lot of sugar to their dishes). Their portions are big so you have enough for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"We got there at 5 PM, no crowd, able to park on Highland. Seating was good except the wall seats are REALLY low and my friend across the table is REALLY tall so I did feel a bit small. Background music was pleasant and not overbearing. Wait staff very helpful. I had the noodles with tamarind sauce and #2 heat - it was just right and the vegetables were just the right crisp cooked for my taste. I also ordered the spring rolls which were deep fried to perfection, keeping the filling fresh tasting and not greasy. Don't forget the cash only and BYOB but I checked out their web site in advance so I was ready."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and lots of flavor!  I got the curry when I went (with a spice level four) and it had the perfect spicy flavor without being too painful.  Overall- excellent taste, perfect portions and inexpensive establishment that I will definitely return to in the future!"}
{"text":"I've come here literally once a month for the past 4 years because they always have the most delicious and tasty Thai flavors in every single dish on the menu. If you're considering going here, definitely don't think twice! Start with some yummy appetizers (I love the pork belly buns and spring rolls) and then get a heaping plate of noodles (my favs are the Chiang Mai curry/Kee Mao/Pad Thai). I have never been disappointed in their quality, flavor or quantity of food. Prices are super reasonable which is always wonderful. Best part is that they're BYOB and only charge 50cents per person for the \"recycling fee\". Much cheaper than other BYOB places that can charge you up to $15 to bring your own booze?? It's a very popular joint since the food/vibes are awesome so on a weekend I usually avoid arriving between 7-8 and usually only have to wait around 20-30min. They don't take reservations, and they don't have a phone and they only take cash, BUT TRUST ME its worth jumping through all of those hoops for their food!!"}
{"text":"Hoooooly Hell this place is good!!  Get the Pork Belly Streamed Buns!!!GET THEM!! Do it!!  They are so AMAZIIING I can't even believe it! Super soft, sweet bun with Pork that is tender and flavorful! Sweet & Spicy Pig Wings make the tongue tingle with pleasure!! The Sliced Grilled beef with lemongrass chili garlic sauce is delish and spicy:) The Love Boat with its thin rice noodles simmered beef in a rich spicy broth warms the Everything! Street Noodle #1 has rice noodles, perfectly fried tempura chicken, Bok Choy & cilantro ... Puts a tingle on the lips !! Come early cause this place fills up quick! Bring cash- and an appetite:)
No credit cards!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but not excellent. They have a range of spicy and if you cannot handle a super spicy food, don't even ask for number 1! The place is nice."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing, the best Pad Thai I've ever had. They are Cash ONLY and the only reason why I don't give it a 5 star review its because it's a little disorganized with long list of people waiting to be seated. They need to find a better system to deal with people waiting and how they keep track of those seated. But the food it's absolutely amazing. This was my first time in Pittsburgh and I will be back just to have Pad Thai!"}
{"text":"Really torn between a 3.5 and 4 star review!!  Super cute space and yummy flavors, but the menu is pretty limited and the portions are on the smaller side.

Overall I felt like the dishes had really nice strong flavors.  I was able to try the Chiang Mai Noodles and the Street Style Noodles #1.

Chiang Mai Noodles - sort of a curry base with noodles.  Definitely my top pick!
Street Style Noodles#1 - noodles with really deliciously fried chicken.  You also get quite a bit of chicken.  So even though I felt like the portion was a little small, it's actually really filling!   My main complaint with this dish is that the sauce was a little too sweet in my opinion.  The sauce is a good balance with the fried chicken, but there was just a little too much of it."}
{"text":"Avoid Friday Night!!
I went there on Friday night. It took nearly an hour to be seated and another 15 minutes to be served. I ordered Sukhothai Noodles. Personally, I like the ingredients. I can say that it's like eating in Thailand. It came with all ingredients which Sukhothai noodles should have, like what it is in Thailand. However, the taste was somewhat too light. It should be more sour, sweet and a little bit salty. For spicy level, 3 could be enough for some of Thai people like me. 

I would be back again for sure, because they have the real Thai noodles. It is kind of difficult to find the real Thai noodles like this in Pittsburgh. I'm still thinking of Thai fried chicken. Certainly, I won't be there on Friday night again."}
{"text":"Noodle head is one of my favorite restaurants in Pgh.  It's simple, clean, inexpensive and the food is to die for.  I go there at least once a week.  Never had a bad meal, it gets better everytime
See yew and the love boat are my two favorites 
I give it 6 stars"}
{"text":"So good!  Crowded Wednesday evening, but, since I was alone, was able to get a bar seat by the window.  Ordered the pork steamed buns app (as highly recommended by fellow yelper) and they were amazing!  Just the right size and just a tad greasy, nom nom! Then came the chicken pad thai, which was also good.  I was way about the heat index option, so went with level 3 spiciness and it was not spicy (for me any way--I regularly add habaneros, serranos, jalape√±os to dishes I prepare) at all.   I proceeded to douse my entree with Sriracha and all was right with the world.  Next time, I'm definitely going for level 5 spicy! 
Cash only and byob."}
{"text":"Amazing service and atmosphere. Ordered street noodle #1 and Chiang Mai Curry which was absolutely delicious. They do not lie about the spice rating, Thai hot is EXTREMELY hot but delicious! Fantastic food at a fantastic price!"}
{"text":"Do I even need to explain why this place gets 5 stars?

The flat pricing and cash only structure (with a $0.50 per person BYO charge) keeps it simple and totally affordable, and I've almost always got leftovers to take home after a meal here.

As a vegetarian with a million food allergies, I can vouch that they take extra care to double check and make recommendations for me every time. All of their dishes are super well-presented, tasty, and their spicy levels are just right. Ordering a 2 is noticeably different from a 3.

Also important to note... it's a 0 to 5 spice level scale. I once confidently ordered a level 5, thinking it was out of 10, and had to chase them down to switch it to a 2. Lesson learned!"}
{"text":"more of this stuff please! It's all simple but tasty! The steamed buns pork belly is something I wish I could eat every single damn day!"}
{"text":"Perfectly seasoned noodle bowls with so many choices for flavor and heat. The room in trendy and cute, perfect for this booming college town"}
{"text":"Small menu, but the food is consistently good and more authentic tasting than other Thai places I've been to in Pittsburgh. The only two negatives for me: getting cilantro in my dishes when I make it a point to request it be left out (happened on multiple occasions) and the fact that they don't accept credit cards (I hate it when I'm almost there and I realize I forgot to bring cash with me; there's a double fee to withdraw from their ATM)."}
{"text":"I went here with a Noodlehead expert - he helped me pick out the Kee Mao with additional broccoli. 5 stars for flavor and 5 stars for service! Shoutout to the blonde Korean who asked me beforehand if I wanted oyster sauce in it - thank goodness because I'm vegan. This place is really accommodating for vegetarians/vegans. 

They only take cash, but it's worth it! Pretty good size for their crowd, too. The ambiance was chill, food was served pretty quickly. Will be back again."}
{"text":"What else is there to say. I love this place! The ambiance, simple menu and great tasting food. Food comes fast and is very reasonably priced for the quality. I was in Pittsburg for an extended weekend and caught the Steelers game and ate both dinner and lunch here.  

4 stars as weight staff is not always the most attentive and I'd love to see some specials or maybe something seasonal."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and the staff is nice. I always get a 4 for the level of spice, the 6 is a little too much for me. Great experience every time I go, take out is also a great idea."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both the entrees and appetizers are delicious. the menu doesn't have that many options but my friends and I are always impressed with what we order. great atmosphere as well"}
{"text":"Good food although I think it has been on a downward trend since I first tried it a year ago."}
{"text":"Best place in town. Make sure to budget some time to wait for a seat during prime time.  Bring a bottle of wine it's BYOB! Everything on the menu is fantastic! I wish they had a phone number so I could order to go more easily."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh and I would say that this is my favorite. I ordered their Chiang Mai Curry. The curry was flavorful and had the exact spice level I ordered: just enough spice to add flavor to the food! The taste and generous portion size exceeded my expectations considering the cheap price. I've heard their pork buns are good too - definitely would go here again."}
{"text":"I am completely in love with Noodlehead!!!  

After reading reviews about this Thai street food restaurant in Shadyside, I got up early one Saturday, and took myself there for lunch.  I got there at 12:15, shortly after they opened.  It is a wonderfully relaxed, seat yourself, BYOB, CASH ONLY place.  

And the food....ooooooh the foooooood....

I got the pork belly steamed buns, which I could live on, honestly.  Absolutely amazing.  I tried the Sukothai, a soup on their \"snack\" menu.  Wonderful stuff.  And although I should have stopped there, and I didn't realize those two items would be a perfect meal, I also ordered the Street Noodles #2, which was also completely yum.  I got enough food for 2 meals for $22!!!   

I have been telling everyone I know to check this place out.  A place this wonderful just further proves to me that Pittsburgh is becoming a foodie town.

A couple things to keep in mind:

- it is cash only, but there are 3 atms in a 2 block radius.
- Being Shadyside, it is on street metered parking, and I recommend leaving S. Highland Street for a side street and walking a block or two.  Don't forget your quarters."}
{"text":"Easily the best Thai food in Pittsburgh! Everything from the pork belly sliders to the pad kee Mao is absolutely stellar. (But seriously, do not pass up the pork belly sliders). Yes, they are cash only but they do have an ATM available so it's no big deal. They're also BYOB which helps on keeping the cost of your check down! They have a very reasonable corking fee. I've had nothing but good experiences and stellar service here!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing, our waitress checked in on us multiple times.

Food was great! Spice didn't kick in until later so be careful about underestimating the spice level. I got the See Yew which tasted authentic."}
{"text":"Everything I have ever had here is delicious. The service is fast and friendly. They are almost always busy, busy the wait is with it. The cost to quality radio is amazing. I love the see yew and the kee mao. The spice level goes from one to five. I really like heat, and I usually get a level 4. They are BYOB and close to a liquor store. They don't have a phone, so any take out orders have to be made in person. They are cash only with an ATM on site. I would go there multiple times a week if I could"}
{"text":"Hello all. You don't know me yet but you will some day. I am a restaurant professional who has been in virtually every position in the business, including gm for over 7 years, owner, bartender, server, cook, host, wine steward, and server. 

Yelp is a broken system that does not take into account the level of knowledge of the reviewer. This means any person, regardless of whether or not they have ever even eaten sushi in their whole lives can defame a great sushi restaurant because the fish was cold. Maybe their review will be taken with a grain of salt but that all powerful star rating will be affected. I am aiming to help mitigate the lost trust in yelp and it's army of posters by giving a professional expert opinion regarding restaurants. 

Now- noodle head. 
Atmosphere and construction:
The decor is interesting and very well done, featuring petrified wood and copper and iron with lots of track lighting and nice looking chic tables. It also features \"picnic\" tables for communal family dining in the center. The space is slightly cramped but not to the point of discomfort. They have some small tables for outside dining in warmer times. The restrooms are to the rear left of the building and were clean and stocked. 

The service:
The night we were in they were very busy. It was a mild and balmy Tuesday but they were nearly full. the greeting was pleasant and they sat us fairly quickly. They explained the menu and how it all worked and said a server would be right with us. We waited about 9 minutes for a server to arrive and then an additional 10 minutes for waters. My soda did not come for about 20 mijutes. (After we got our appetizer)
After this snafu the server was very polite and seemed to know a fair amount about the food, but not an expert. No other service issues happened. 

The menu:
It is small, concise, and fun to read. It was easy even for people who do not frequently eat Asian food. Not a lot of options, but you'll see why that doesn't much matter here in my opinion. 

The food: 
Outstanding. My wife got the see yu and I got noodles #1 with a spicy level of 4. It was as hot as I expected. The food was a bit salty, but not offensively. The flavor was exceptional and the dishes were obviously well designed as nothing seemed out of place. The rice noodles were cooked perfectly, and rice noodles are notoriously hard to cook. 

The bar: not applicable. It is byob. They were accommodating with glassware for wine drinkers.

The experience:
Despite some issues in the beginning with service we left very happy. The busy nature of the location, friendly staff up front, excellent and concise menu, delicious food, and well designed interior made this a true delight. Not a good fancy night out spot but if you're in a fun mood and hungry for Eastern, This is one of my top recommendations.

{"text":"Authentic and deliciously spicy. Moderate price and BYOB makes it the best for date night."}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai noodles! I've been a few times now and will definitely return. Yes, the $9 price tag seems like a lot, but not in comparison to other Asian restaurants in the area. You're paying for the convenience, but it's definitely worth it. I've had street noodles 1 and 2 and kee mao, which is basically drunken noodle that I've gotten from many other Thai places. It's delicious but too similar to other dishes I've had and loved before. I'm going back for the street noodles, which are totally new dishes for me. They are sweet and spicy, my favorite combination. The fried chicken was fantastic; it was crispy but moist, tender, and not greasy at all. Definitely my favorite dish so far. My husband got the sukothai and pork buns, which he loved. We're definitely returning for those dishes. 
Yes, it is cash only. No, they don't have a phone. Yes, you can get takeout. Just show up and order. Dishes are made fresh and only take about 5 minutes to prepare. Our server told us that cash only and no phone were meant to keep costs down, especially important in such a high rent area. 

Overall, I definitely recommend visiting. I didn't care for the last two Thai places in this location, mostly due to the mediocre food and high cost (much more so than noodlehead). Noodlehead's opening was a pleasant surprise, and I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Relocating from Bangkok for grad school and finding Noodlehead was an extraordinary experience. The interior design of Noodlehead is rustic and industrial, which contrasts with the atmosphere when I eat those offering dishes back home. Most of the noodle dishes are the foods that Thai people eat daily and they are easily found from every corner of the streets in Thailand. Love Boat with Thai hot level of spiciness was my first dinner after hitting the town. It was wow, better than the one back home. I came later and ordered Kee Mao with shrimp. Substituting from big flat rice noodles to thin rice noodles was one customization I made. Once again, it still tasted better than food back home. Even though the atmosphere is different than what you would expect in Thailand, if you want an authentic taste of Thai street noodles, here is the place for you.

It's BYOB and cash only, so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"It's a hit or miss! I personally love noodlehead and have probably been here 25 times in the past 3 years. I would say their food is a Thai fusion inspired street food. The one critique I would give noodlehead is that sometimes their food isn't very consistent. A couple times I've been there their noodles were extremely bland and had no flavor or seasoning at all. But the rest of the times their dishes were amazing! Be prepared with cash, if not there's an atm located inside. And be prepared to wait on Fridays and Saturday Evenings, they don't take reservations! They are extremely busy on evenings so their service is sometimes not the greatest, but the staff is alway very friendly!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has excellent Pad Kee Mao and pad see ew - two of my favorite Thai dishes... The quality is always consistently high and the ambulance is always happening and lively - along with the low cost and the delicious flavors this is always a great place to go for dinner. The seats are not comfortable for long seatings and they are a cash only establishment. Id give them four stars if they had better seats and took credit cards."}
{"text":"For what the restaurant is: a casual Thai noodle shop - it's one of the best restaurants in the Shadyside area. All the noodle dishes are great and very authentic. The pad thai, chiang mai curry, street noodles, and the pork belly buns are all very legit and well worth your time. 

A few downsides: BYOB and cash only, and for takeout there's no phone orders or online ordering, which means you'll have to go there and place your order. As long as you don't go during the peak times it shouldn't be too bad of a wait (10-15 minutes tops). Also, when it gets busy the service level does seem to drop a bit for dine-in, but not enough to drop a star off my review.
One more thing: their spice levels seem to vary day-to-day, sometimes a 2 is very spicy and a 3 is more mild.

All in all, if you find yourself visiting Shadyside, this place is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price. Decent service and ambience. Vegetarian options available for vegetarians like me. You can also bring your beer and drinks with you. One of the delicious place to bring your friends and enjoy Thai food."}
{"text":"Love the pork buns and sukothai.  BYOB :)"}
{"text":"it's the only thai food in the city that is palatable. Even though smiling banana is much closer to my house, Noodlehead is consistent, always delicious, though the menu is small, everything is amazing. Thanks to it's affordability, you can also eat here frequently. The staff is also great."}
{"text":"Great food at good price!!! Definitely worth it, if you want good noodles, this is the place to go!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, price is just right $9 for all noodles!!! The sauce is what makes their dishes so yummy. I had the see yaw noodles which I will definitely get again!! 

The only hassle is that they only accept cash here."}
{"text":"Hello, Noodlehead!  This place was amazing and I would go back again in a heartbeat.  Delicious, fast, and well-priced.  Great find!"}
{"text":"My experience last night at Noodlehead was the most effort and headache I've ever had to go through for a basic and unimpressive Asian meal.

We were having sendoff dinner for some friends moving out of town and had 10 people attending. The first headache was in figuring out how to coordinate that effort (which is effortless at 99%) of restaurants... We looked them up online to find they don't take reservations. OK, that's fairly common... So we wanted to call and ask the best way of seating 10 people. Oddly, they don't have a phone or accept calls either... So we emailed them, and were told to send some of our party an hour early to grab a table. 3 of us showed up as directed and we were told they'd clean the long table for us and seat us when the rest of our party arrived.

An hour later, 8 of our party of 10 were there, and even though our table was cleared we werent allowed to be seated because their policy is to not seat us til EVERYONE was accounted for. The 8 of us filled the entire waiting area, making other guests wait outside in 90+ degree weather. We were reluctantly in the way of the hostess and other guests, and also the table cleaning employees who for whatever reason have to carry dirty dishes across the main entryway to get to the kitchen. Twice one of us backed into a busboy carrying a stack of dishes while we were trying to avoid other foot traffic in the restaurant. It was also hot and humid by the door and waiting area, so we were all drenched in sweat by the time we actually got to our table.

Upon being seated, a service man unexpectedly delivered us 5 plates of appetizers. I thought perhaps this was to make up for the confusion and delay in getting seated, but this was not the case. As we started digging into the apps, the man came back and abruptly took them away from us; apparently they were meant for another table. We'd already started eating them but the restaurant felt it more appropriate to throw them in the garbage. 

Our server was excellent and took good care of our party, and the food was decent, which is all that earned them 2 stars in this review. The food was decent, but nothing special.... My friends on either side of my and I ordered the 3 different noodle plates with chicken, and upon trying each others' meals found them to taste identical, only difference being either flat noodles or rice noodles. Food quality or portion was no better than your standard fast food Thai, nothing remarkable or authentic. I bit into 2 bone chunks in my chicken and alot of chewy fat, so the meat used isnt whitemeat or any special quality. Only difference in the food between Noodlehead and a Thai takeout joint was Noodlehead cost more and any eggrolls or soup appetizers are charged separately instead of being included with the meal. As far as taste, it couldn't compare to good authentic cuisine like Nicky's Thai, who is also cheaper and includes a soup or salad with any meal.

Noodlehead doesn't accept credit cards, which isn't a huge deal, however it's strange for a classy modern restaurant to penny pinch in that regard, especially considering what they charge for overpriced unremarkable meals. Tack on another $3 ATM fee to pull cash from their ATM (which had a line of people behind it who also were baffled at the cash only policy.) 

Our check total was over $150 for 10 people, and they tacked on a 20% automatic gratuity for our large party. Of course they wouldn't split that check so we had a fun time calculating how much everyone owed on our own. With this added headache of the restaurants reluctance to split the check, no one felt the urge to tip over the automatic 20%, yet since no one had an abundance of $1 bills we still ended up leaving an extra 10% or so (and like I mentioned, we had no complaints with our waitress so didn't want to make her suffer for the overall negative experience.)

I normally like to talk cordially with management about any issues before posting a negative review, but was then reminded they don't have a phone in the restaurant. Rather than typing this all up in an email that may or may not get a response, I figured I'd cut to the chase and tell others of the experience they can expect at Noodlehead.

In summary, if you like sweating in a crowded waiting area, carry an abundance of cash on person, have a party of no more than 2, and are in the mood for overpriced Thai fast food in a nice decor, Noodlehead is right up your alley. If you want quality or authentic Asian food and a simple straightforward meal experience, go ANYWHERE else."}
{"text":"I would not call myself a Pad Thai expert but this is the best Pad Thai I've had.  The 1/5 spicy was still a little hot for me but it was very tasty."}
{"text":"The Love boat is my favorite Pho in the city.  This alone is worth the visit."}
{"text":"Hands down best noodles for the price in Pittsburgh. Great atmosphere, too. I hope Noodlehead sticks around for years to come!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. I always go there since they're open but after I met some Thai lady that work at another Thai restaurant. She told me they don't use good stuff and it might be poison me sometime. she said she knows because she use to work there then she quit because the owners so cheap. That made me afraid if I go back again !!"}
{"text":"This place is a must try! It has a perfect ambiance and delicious food! Remember to bring cash!"}
{"text":"Had a Pad Thai with tofu. It was good, perhaps just a little too sweet. I asked for spice level 1 out of 5 and it was too spicy. Next time I will ask for no spice at all.

The price was good.

Cash only is a big nuisance. The table I sat at was worn down and the environment was extremely noisy. Also there was a long wait time. 

Felt like a good place for takeout."}
{"text":"Updating my first review, as I received a really generous response from Noodlehead, and haven't had any problems on following return visits which have exceeded expectations."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Thai food, you know a place is good when they do not take reservations and there is always a line out of the door!  I've never been dissapointed, also bonus points its BYOB! I can also never not order the pork buns, they are AMAZING. Definitely check this place out, it's SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Great place serving great noodles with loads of good stuff in. When say spicy they mean spicy by the way."}
{"text":"I can't even remember what I ordered, but it was delicious. Though the prices are low, the atmosphere feels more upscale."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh. You can tell that they use high quality ingredients and the prices are decent. I got the pork buns, love boat and pad see ew with chicken. All delicious and plenty of food to share between myself and my fiance.  Their spice scale is 1-5 as opposed to 1-10 so be careful :)

I just wish they had a phone number so I could call a takeout order and as others have said it's cash only."}
{"text":"I am so happy to find this place, totally helped me with my homesick of the street food back home. 
I love their Street Noodle #1 and the love boat. They use very authentic spices and ingredients which make the dishes taste great. And when they say it is Thai hot, they mean it. The atmosphere is relaxed and I have no problem finding tables every time I go there.
Only bummer is cash only and hard to find parking, but their food is so great I am willing to go through the trouble to go there and eat."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants with my girlfriend. We go here on a biweekly basis. Cash only, reasonably priced on portions - in most cases enough food for leftovers for a lunch the following day. 

We have had all the dishes on the menu - both street noodles are great, but my favorite is the pad thai. 

With it being BYOB, you can stop at the wine and spirits right around the corner and pick out a bottle for your date or group.

Crowds have picked up around 645/7 pm Monday nights - no problem getting a table for 2/4/6 at 6 PM"}
{"text":"The pork buns are absolutely amazing. The rest of their food is good, but definitely takes a back seat to the pork buns.

cash-only, don't forget to hit the ATM on your way over."}
{"text":"Obviously a popular place since we had to wait for half an hour. Interiors were done in a modern/industrial style. Service was efficient and quick. Menu was limited. 
Food tasted average. Have had much better Thai elsewhere. But the overall cost, ambience and service is what contributes to it being an above average place to go for a meal.
Payment is only in cash."}
{"text":"The relatively limited seating is unfortunate, but otherwise this restaurant has a great atmosphere, food, and value. Can't beat the price for the standard of the dishes. The pork buns were the highlight, but all of the few things I've had were good."}
{"text":"Went to Noodlehead on a date recently and both me and my date loved our food! I got the See eeuw noodles and it was delicious! I thought they had the perfect amount of spiciness paired with sweetness (I got level 1 spiciness). The chicken, egg, and veggies in my noodles were well cooked and I only wish there was more on my plate haha. They aren't kidding when they talk about the level of spice. My date got his pad thai at a spiciness of 3 and he said it was super spicy. It's BYOB with a  .50 charge per person and the meal was super cheap. My only regret is that I didn't get the pork buns as an appetizer because they looked absolutely delicious! Note, that this restaurant only accepts cash but they do have an ATM on site in case you forget :) The atmosphere is great, the food is spectacular, and I will definitely be back for Round 2 soon!"}
{"text":"Recently tried this restaurant. Very nice atmosphere and extremely efficient service. The noodle dishes were fabulous though the dumplings not my favorite. The dipping sauce for them though was so good we joked about drinking it. Note that it is BYOB. Definitely a perfect location for a quick dinner out."}
{"text":"It was my husband and my first time eating there last weekend and it was a great first impression. I am Thai. Although, our stomachs allowed us to try just three dishes :(, I would say Noodlehead does really good job! as best as it can get considering getting all the ingredients needed in United States. 
We had
- Thai Fried Chicken, battered chicken tender. In Thailand it is more common to use chicken drumsticks or wings, but Noodlehead does good job, and chicken tender doesn't take away any good-authentic taste.
- Sukothai, GREAT! I made just only one mistake for not ordering it really spicy. I had 3 level spicy in stead of what I should have done - 5 level. It would have been fantastic.
- Love Boat, FANTASTIC! I had it with 3 level spicy and no complaint! 

We look forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"Easy pricing and cheap pricing. They are a little slow on the service but the noodles are flavorful and a spice level of 10 is actually pretty spicy! BYOB is pretty nice. Cash only is painful."}
{"text":"What can I say, great food at an excellent price.  BYOB helps to keep our evenings affordable. Excellent place to dine, it's our go-to restaurant."}
{"text":"Maybe the best restaurant in Pittsburgh and very affordable. Great service and cool atmosphere. It's always packed but they still always seem to get you a table quick."}
{"text":"A great place for a good, cheap Asian dinner. All their dishes are reasonably priced and very generous (but not overly so). One of my favorite noodle places."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong at Noodlehead, but their Chiang Mai chicken might just be the single best dish in the entire city. It's that good. I also appreciate the fact that Noodlehead will actually make your food spicy if you so request (still not as spicy as I'd like, but they do far better than most)."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp Pad Thai with level 2 to go ($10). Short wait in the shop which smelled so good of Thai quinine. The amount was enough to feed two, maybe even better if I added the snacks on the To Go menu. (Didn't find the pork belly on it though).
The Pad Thai itself was fairly good but seemed to be missing some flavour. Wondering if they use Nam Pla (fish sauce) because if they are, I didn't notice and am thinking that was one of the missing flavours.
Nicely decorated place with funky music in the back not too loud. Other customers at that time were in their mid 20 - 40's. 
Willing to revisit for other menus."}
{"text":"Love this place and eat here roughly once a week! Cheap and BYOB. I love all the noodles, especially the pad thai and the see yew. The chicken is nice and tender with the street noodle 1. The pork buns are pretty amazing too, 

I have never really tried any of their soups or curries however."}
{"text":"Every time I visit this restaurant I am again reminded of how fantastic the menu is. For a surprisingly small and somewhat simple menu, they offer a lot of diversity. The appetizer portions are modest, especially for the price, but they are exceptionally done. I highly recommend the pork wings - their taste and presentation are simply wonderful!

The decor is stunning -- rustic barn meets urban chic loft. Their complication of seating, that includes a lot of benches and stools are still surprisingly comfortable even if you linger for a while. The outdoor seating is sparse, as it is limited to the sidewalk, but it's still enjoyable, especially in off-peak hours. 

Bring your dollars, as this is cash only. Might as well bring some wine, as it's also BYOB. Take out is enjoyable and relatively speedy, even when the restaurant is packed. However, the presentation and perhaps even quantity, is greater if you dine in. I've never been able to stray from the curry dish when I order, but seeing other items on the menu tell me that there is no bad choice on the menu.  And with each main dish being $9, you really do get a lot of bang for your buck in that aspect. 
All in all, this place is a joy and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Noodlehead doesn't disappoint.  Try the pork buns!  I've never had a meal that I don't like, but my favorite is pad se eu with tofu.  Watch out for the spice levels though--even a 1 (on a 1-5 scale) is quite spicy.  

The only annoying thing about this place is that they don't have a phone.  You can't order takeout or make a reservation.  It's also cash-only, but there's an off-brand ATM on-site."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today. We were seated very quickly. Food was very good. I had one of the noodle soups and pad thai which was great...One suggestion is to pace courses between soup and entree. Soup was a nice portion size and did not even get 2 bites and entree was delivered...I was pleased to see that they added an A.T.M. since they do not take credit card..."}
{"text":"Cash only, ATM on premises. BYOB!!!! We had a few apps/snacks, all good. Noodles were tasty although I could have endured more heat, I chose #5. We had the Kee Mao, See Yew, and Pad Thai. Not an extensive menu, which I like, and it's about $15 per person for noodles and an app. Definitely coming back next time in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants!! A small menu and have enjoyed all of the items we've tried. Our favorites are Chang Mai Curry and Street Noodle #2. The offer spice levels 1 -5 and don't americanize the levels. We usually order 4s and that brings some heat. It's BYOB, cash only and we suggest going early because this place gets crowded quickly. This is a must try if you're in Shadyside!"}
{"text":"Pork buns, pork buns, PORK BUNS!!! Unbelievably good.

The food here is fantastic. Everything I've tried has been great. Note that their spice scale, 1 - 5, is not playing around. I normally order an 8 or a 9 at most Indian restaurants, but at Noodlehead I'm a solid 3 and nothing more.

They won't seat you until your entire group has arrived, they're cash only, and they don't take reservations or even have a phone, but the food is fantastic.

Go. Eat pork buns."}
{"text":"Very cheap Thai food but very good!!! I was thoroughly impressed with the spices and noodles. Not many places understand how to make food spicy but tasteful. 

I wish there was more variety and specials."}
{"text":"Okay so I'm giving a four star because the frigging chairs and stools where uncomfortable to me.
The food outstanding - love boat soup and noodle number 1 chicken and 2 shrimp.
Atmosphere was really very nice and in generally just comfortable.
I will not go back solely because of the seating...I prefer to be comfortable while dining."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Beware: the spice ratings are authentic. The food is so delicious. Hooray."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, great location on a wonderful street, and the prices are actually pretty good: 9 dollars for a noodle dish.

However, the food was below average. The pork bun appetizer featured pulled pork that was overly sweetened. The noodle dishes were trying to mix too many flavors and ended up too fishy and too sweet. Thai hot option simply meant further dousing with hot chili's, and not favor enhancement. Overall we didn't care too much for all our dishes."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai in the City!  Love this restaurant, Never a bad meal, very good service, very reasonable prices and a cool ambiance.

highly recomended."}
{"text":"Went for a lunch and had the 'Love Boat' soup and the Pork Belly Steamed Buns. Both were very full of flavor, not timid at all. The steamed buns had a great pork in it, very tender and flavorful. A fresh chopped herb, pickle, and sliced jalepeno topping accompanying the pork, which helped balance and brighten the overall taste. The soup was moderately spicy and heavy on the cilantro (I love it, but be warned if you don't). Plenty of meat and noodles, it was fairly hardy as far as asian soups go. I wish there was more broth, I could have drank a huge bowl of it. They could probably lose the chitlins they put on top. I like the idea, but they were a little bit chewy and not very flavorful. Overall, would get both again.

I agree with the other review that said the portion sizes were a bit uneven. The more expensive dishes don't really seem to be proportionally sized. Overall, the portions are medium-sized. You won't be stuffed after you leave, but the two dishes I had kept me full until dinner."}
{"text":"1) No credit card

2) \"M'am I'm vegetarian. Can you replace chicken with tofu instead?\" Waitress: \"Sorry, our chefs don't make changes to dishes. They cannot understand\" Don't go here for vegetarian food that's overpriced and mediocre at best

3) Service is slow

4) No credit card (not a typo)"}
{"text":"I'd give it a 3.5.

It's good. Not as good as Silk Elephant or Nicky's Thai, but good. 

The steam buns were definitely my favorite part, but the curry and pad see ew were just ok compared to other thai places in Pittsburgh. I did like the spice level. I love spicy food and a 3 on the 1-5 scale was good for me, if not a tiny bit too hot. 

The seating is pretty horrible. None of the chairs have backs, and it's really uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Simple, straightforward menu with complex flavors. My favorite dish to date has been the Chiang Mai Curry. Its got this divine yellow curry coconut milk sauce with great heat to it. Both the street noodles are pretty tasty (#2 being the lighter option if that's what you're in to ) and there's solid pad thai or see yew when you aren't feeling adventurous- no shame! BYOB & cash only."}
{"text":"The dishes were great here and cheap. Plus byob keeps the cost down. Spice levels were pretty accurate. The only dinner at the table we did not enjoy was the street noodle #2 because it was lacking flavor. Everything else was excellent. We waited a long time to be seated but the food came really quickly once we ordered. No ice for waters was also a bummer for people who need to cool off their mouth! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is just a few blocks from my place. Like tge decor. Nice service, quick and helpful. Small menus.  Food  is nice. If you don't wanna spend too much (About $6-$8) and have noodles for lunch - this is your place!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. Very simple menu and affordable prices. The street noodles were tasty and had just enough heat. The curry noodles were even better as left overs the next day. Waiters were attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"Still a solid choice for dinner or lunch. At $9 per dish, prices are hard to beat. The menu is limited and you have to pay in cash, but service is quick.

Warning: seating is uncomfortable, so don't plan to stay long.

The Chiang Mai curry (with chicken, egg noodles) is AMAZING! If you are spice averse this place is not for you!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but the cash only policy and no take out orders by phone makes it a bit disappointing and inconvenient."}
{"text":"This place is really great.  Have been there 5 times and tried almost everything on the menu.  All appetizers are excellent - pork buns, pig wings (little pork ribs,) and thai fried chicken!  My only gripe is many dishes are a bit too spicy for my taste.  But there is something for everyone and the atmosphere is wonderful."}
{"text":"Consistently great.  Love the food, know exactly what we are getting each time we visit."}
{"text":"I loved Noodlehead. Food quality was top notch. Taste was superior. Unfortunately my love and bi-weekly trips to the restaurant ended several months back.

Half way through my take-out Pad See Ew - I bit into a wing. A crispy wing. Investigating I found a meaty inch-wide bug with a stinger. Luckily the bug was whole."}
{"text":"Love their food, especially their pork buns and the 'street food' noodles. Only thing to remember that it is cash only and BYOB."}
{"text":"I go here a lot, mostly out of convenience and because their prices are very fair -- 10 bucks for a decent meal, often lasts for 2 meals in fact. Most of their food is really delicious, but I knocked off a star for their gross tofu and iffy service. I used to get See Ew with tofu as my go-to dish, but the past several times the tofu has been very over-fried, making it nothing but a chewy outer shell of tofu. Fried tofu should be a bit chewy or crispy on the outside with an inside of be actual tofu, not empty, pulverized, over-fried air. this almost lost them my business, but fortunately I do eat meat so I tried the See Ew with chicken, and it was great! My new go-to dish."}
{"text":"The food and environment was absolutely fantastic. Very very inexpensive and a very pleasant place to eat. Only downside is that it's byob."}
{"text":"OMG the pork belly steamed buns are amazing!  Prices are super reasonable, the food is yummy, and the decor is hip.  Definitely will be returning here!  Only downside is that it is cash only."}
{"text":"Omg, everything on their menu is incredible. They've dialed their flavors down. Hardly ever have I been less than ecstatic after my meals here, and I've had everything in the menu. I'd say the best and most consistently excellent meal is the Chang mai curry.

Really can't go wrong with their entree menu items. Not the biggest fan of their appetizers or the Pad Thai. If their other meals are a 4.5 or 5 out of 5, the pad Thai is a 2.5 or 3/5. I think this meal needs some work in making it the same taste and quality as their other menu items."}
{"text":"Try the Chang Mai Curry, really really good. Daughter sampled mine, said it was her new favorite there. Ordered spice level 2, and it was pretty spicy. If you like some heat but not enough to overpower the taste, 2 is about right."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place for Thai food in the city. The food is delicious, the prices are reasonable, and the staff are generally friendly and helpful. The only thing holding back that last  is of course the cash only, no pre-ordered take out policies. That said, I get why they don't do it--they don't need to because we all come grovelling in with our archaic paper money and will wait around until our food is ready anyway."}
{"text":"I live in Shadyside and this is my favorite go-to restaurant. Satisfies all my spicy taste buds. Love this place. I wish they had a phone number listed because I'd order pick up almost every day!"}
{"text":"Noodles! And the pork bun, sooo good yum.   But always a loooong wait :("}
{"text":"I visited with a friend on a rainy Tuesday evening around 7:00. We elected to wait for a table instead of sitting at the counter, and we were seated within five minutes.

We ordered pork dumplings to share, I got Street Noodle #2 at spicy level 1, and my friend ordered the Sukhothai at spicy level 2. There were four pork dumplings per order. They put a fun twist on them and they looked a bit more like shaomai. However, I wished the filling was more flavorful; I found it overly meaty. The Street Noodle #2 was delicious. You could taste the stir-fry and garlic in the noodles, the shrimp were delightfully crsipy, and the spice level was perfect for me. My friend also enjoyed her Sukhothai, though she  found the spice a little much. All in all, it was a delicious meal. My friend and I agreed that we have to return to try other menu items--they all looked so good!

The service was very prompt. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, but he always seemed rushed (understandably) and it was difficult to ask additional questions. They were also very accommodating and helpful with our birthday celebration, giving us utensils and plates for the cake we brought and offering a lighter for the candles."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I could live off of the steam buns. I have to admit that I've only ever tried the Street Noodle #1 and #2, but I love them both so I always end up getting the same thing!"}
{"text":"Visited around 6 PM on a Sunday and proceeded to stand in the foyer area confused for several minutes because there were plenty of seats but no one seeming to be taking anyone to them. Apparently a lot of people were waiting for/ordering takeout which created the bottleneck. Facilitating a way to better distinguish dine-in vs. takeout would help...

Eventually, we were seated. The ambiance was nice enough... certainly had a hipster-ish vibe though which straddles the line between cool and pretentious. We ordered spring rolls, street noodles 2 and kee mao. The service was satisfactory. The food was also good and relatively inexpensive but I can't say it was any better than other Thai dishes I had elsewhere. The portions however- specifically my street noodles - were also small. I'd happily pay a few extra dollars to leave not still hungry.

Sometimes I feel like certain places collapse under the weight of their inflated yelp reviews and to me this was the case here."}
{"text":"Selection is limited to a small street style menu, however everything on the menu is delicious.  Expect to wait a bit for a table. Once seated food comes quickly. BYOB and cash only."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I can't describe my love for this place. The pulled pork belly steamed buns is awesome. It's impossible to come here without ordering them. The only problem with this place is that they don't have a PHONE. You can't call to pick up dinner. You can't call for a table. You can't call them for anything. Food is great but service is terrible.   Food out weighs the horrible service."}
{"text":"I had the loveboat which was just ok. Broth was over seasoned and flank steak tasteless. I was expecting a beautiful rich pork broth that can stand on its own, but had something that resembled pre packaged ramen. The prices are good, but like other reviews, portions are small, which is ok with me. Pork belly bun did not have pork belly, but rather roast pork ( shoulder?)  which did have a nice flavor/texture. My partner had street noodle #2, which tasted like someone poured a bottle of sweet chili sauce and tossed some fried shrimp on top. This place will probably do good because of near by college crowd, but for someone looking for a legit noodle place that resembles the likes of momofuku, don't bother. I personally like their other restaurant better, pusadee's garden."}
{"text":"Alright.  I'll be up front with this: three stars is a little harsh.  I would like to give it 3 and a half, but that's not possible, and 4 is a little too generous.

I have been to this place twice and both times the food (the See Yew) was AMAZING.  But even at a 2 spicy level the first time, I was almost crying due to the spicyness.

The tables inside are too close together.  I feel like I'm dining with the people next to me...

I also dislike that they have no refillable drinks, but they bring you a carafe of water so that's pretty cool.

I'll definitely be back though and you should go."}
{"text":"Yummy, fast and fun. They don't serve any alcohol - but that makes your price tag extremely reasonable. Great casual ambiance."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite Shadyside spots! When my husband and I lived in Shadyside this was one of our go to date nights!  Seating is tough and there is no phone, but it is worth the wait!  I have never had a bad meal here.  The pork buns are to die for and just melt in your mouth!  The noodle portions are huge!! Remember to bring a bottle of wine with you as it is BYOB."}
{"text":"Good, cheap noodles. Their Chiang Mai Curry Noodles might be my favorite Thai dish in Pittsburgh. Definitely a must-try."}
{"text":"Pad kee mow for the win! Spicy scale is 1-5 and yes they make it hot! I love that the dishes are no more than$9 and it is byob. Beautiful space with dim light. I could come here at least once per week if I lived closer."}
{"text":"When I had Thai neighbors, and they wanted to go out for Thai food, this is where we went. 

The menu is concise and the available dishes are amazing. Be forwarned, though, when they say spicy, they mean it. I'm assured that though the names aren't in Thai, the dishes are authentic.

I especially love the pricing. You can eat cheap if you're not starving, or you can spend more and eat a lot of good food. And, yes, he pork belly steamed buns are as good as you've heard.

Also, I've experienced very good service. The only downside is that parking can sometimes be a bit scarce."}
{"text":"The pork appetizer is very good! I didn't like the tall bar stools for eating dinner, some back support would have been more comfortable. The wait staff is friendly. I would try the Thai chicken next time- on the snack section of menu. Be sure to bring cash for bill. Outdoor seating is on sidewalk out front and is limited to about 3 - 4 tables."}
{"text":"Small portions. Bland flavor, but pretty spicy at their \"medium\" level. We got the dumplings which we're small and bland. We got the fried chicken noodles, and the bok choy in it was almost non-existent."}
{"text":"Cheap, SPICY and BYOB.  What else do you need?  Oh yeah food.  I have had or sampled everything on the menu and have enjoyed everything including shrimp dishes (considering I don't like shrimp says a lot.)
The pork buns are amazing and I hate sharing them!  

On weekends the wait can be long since they don't take reservations but the friendly staff will happily open your wine while you wait.  Ask and they will put beer in the cooler for you as well.

CAUTION their spice scale (1-5) is very, very hot at a 3!  I can't imagine ordering a five so beware."}
{"text":"Love this place.  You can get it hot or not.  They only take cash.  Street noodle 2 is my favorite.  We also had Street noodle 1, pad Thai and others."}
{"text":"I really think that this is one of the better restaurants in Pittsburgh. The food quality is amazing and the prices are excellent. I moved to Pittsburgh from San Francisco and Noodlehead is one of the few restaurants in this city that remind me of restaurants in SF. The pork buns are amazing- I'm constantly craving them. I've been happy with everything that I've ordered but am especially partial to the Sukothai, Street Noodle #1, and Kee Mao. Plus, it's BYOB so a whole evening out here is really affordable. The only downside is that they don't have a phone number listed so you can't call ahead and do take-out or ask about the wait. But I kind of get it- they're so popular that they want to limit that a bit. Oh- and it's cash only, which can be a bummer."}
{"text":"Great pork buns and noodles!! They don't
Joke about spice- 2 is hot to me. All around delicious."}
{"text":"I thought of this is a Thai restaurant, but with a limited menu of noodle dishes only. We started with the dumplings and they were okay, but nothing extrude art. I had the Kee Mao with chicken and it was very flavorful, the noodles were large, and boy was it spicy. I would definitely get it again, but lower spice level.  I like some spice and was advised to under-estimate so I went with a 1 on their 0 to 5 scale. However, I'd ask for a 0.5 (if that's an option) or 0 next time so I don't have to drink 5+ glasses of water again.

The restaurant was very full by 6pm on a Friday but we easily got a table at 5:30pm.  We had a few items at the table come out incorrectly but the staff was very friendly and fixed the problem. The food was very reasonably priced and we enjoyed the atmosphere.

Definitely a neat little restaurant to check out!"}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend there for a little date night this past Friday. The prices are very easy on the wallet. For those who don't know, this is a Thai restaurant. I ordered the Street Noodle #1 and my girlfriend had the Pad Thai. I was actually surprised at how well it tasted for the price. My date enjoyed her Pad Thai. The food is very good though their menu isn't as versatile as say, Thai Cuisine in Bloomfield or Nicky's Thai Kitchen on the North Side. For the price though, Noodlehead is an absolute deal. The restaurant has a trendy feel to it. It is cash only so beware. I had to hit the ATM in the rain. It is also BYOB. They only charge .50cents a person so that's pretty cheap, in line with their menu prices. Overall, the food was tasty, the bill was cheap so there's not too much to complain about at all. Perfect for a cheap date night. I do feel that if you're looking for dining experience to taste the best Thai food around, one of the other 2 options I mentioned will be better...but more expensive.

{"text":"I had a good experience at Noodlehead recently.  It was a study meeting with a classmate from CMU.  I ordered the Phad See Ew with Tofu at a five star spiciness and she ordered the Phad Thai at three stars with shrimp.  There was seating available and we were acknowledged an seated right away.  The waitress had to ask and affirm our order three times before she gave it to the kitchen (she was nice but I expect she was new).  The cost was pretty good in Pittsburgh standards, under $10 per entree.  

The food was served relatively quickly, perhaps 15-20 minutes after we ordered.  The five star spiciness was short of the extremely hot moniker they gave the food (note that they advertised four stars as Thai Spicy).  I would have given the meal a three star spicy rating in Seattle, as I didn't even break a sweat (so considerably less spicy that what I would expect from their rating system.)  Even so, the flavor profile was very good and the noodles were well done with a good amount of fresh veggies (napa cabbage and broccoli).  The portions were a good size as well.  I was temped to pack half of the entree for lunch the next day.

I Pittsburgh this is a four star experience.  I would have rated it at three stars if it were in any of the major cities on the west coast.  I will definitely return - consistency will determine whether it gets bumped up to a 'Pittsburgh' five or downgraded to a three."}
{"text":"The pork buns are a must to start.  I usually go with the street noodle number one.  The chicken that they place over the noodles is really something special.  Be careful with the heat because their 1-5 scale can be a bit deceiving.  \"I like it spicy, but not like uhhh spicy.\""}
{"text":"I happened to walk in here for an impromptu lunch.  The food is good.  The real deal. I recommend the Chang Mai and Soup #2. Anyone who criticizes this food does not know good Thai."}
{"text":"The spice/heat balance has been improved. The service is great now too. 

This place is on our frequent hit list"}
{"text":"Visiting from the west coast I'm used to excellent Asian food.  Having lived in Pittsburgh I know how rare excellent Asian food is here.  But this place is surprisingly good.  In fact the Pad Thai is very close to what you get on the streets of Bangkok.  The Pad See Yew is also great.  If you like spicy start with Thai Hot -- it's 4 on a 5 point scale but it's still rather tame.  

On the down side they only take cash.  On the upside prices are extremely reasonable.  

Easily my goto place in Pittsburgh for noodles, for Asian, or just for delicious."}
{"text":"First time at Noodlehead and the shrimp pad Thai was so good!  And gluten free which was very comforting. I love their pad Thai sauce and that they put crushed peanuts into the dish. All noodles are $9.00. Yes $9.00!!!  There's an ATM machine inside the restaurant if you forget cash."}
{"text":"I've tried everything on their menu and literally everything is dreamworthy.  However, their See ew and the green curry linguine are my absolute favorites.  Theyre pretty much just amazing flavor explosions in my mouth and yet it's never too much.  I always have to bring friends so we can get different plates and share them all because I can never decide what I want!  

One time my boyfriend and I ordered three entrees and porkbuns and managed to eat everything. Have to admit we both had extreme food comas after.

The atmosphere is fantastic- It's comfortable and could suit just about any situation whether you're on a date or a fancy meeting, a fun night out or just a casual dinner with friends.  

The service can be a little slow, but it is awfully busy so it's understandable.  Its not slow enough for me to ever complain. (and the food is soooo worth the wait).
I love siting on the bar along the window- so fun for people watching!

It is cash only, but everything is extremely well priced, so its great!  I only have two gripes: I wish their spicy levels were more extreme!  I've ordered things with 5 (their most spicy level) and it'd be around a 3 at any thai restaurant.  It's unexpected because their dishes have such a perfect balance of every other flavor.

They dont have a phone!  My friend left a bag their once and instead of just calling to check if it was there, we had to bus alll the way back the next day to see if it was still there.

but otherwise...BEST NOODLES IN PITTSBURGH. HANDS DOWN."}
{"text":"Went to Noodlehead for the first time today after hearing a lot of hype about the place. For once the hype was well founded! It truly is some of the best Thai food in \"da burgh.\" The see yew with chicken was absolutely delicious! It had the perfect amount of savoriness and spiciness; really a wonderful combination of flavors. Not to mention that everything on the menu is $9 or less! So, if tasty, inexpensive Thai food is what you're craving, I say jump in on the hype!"}
{"text":"Our first time at Noodlehead, our first time eating Thai food ever. It was delicious, fast & the prices were decent compared to the deliciousness of our lunch. Pork Steam Buns are amazing!"}
{"text":"Showed up at 9:41pm and was basically turned away (offered take-out).  AFAIK there's no way to call in advance - so why list your closing time as 10pm?  And I'm not one to show up right at closing and keep the staff there forever, because, as Chris Rock says, I got f****** to do."}
{"text":"Good food, fun atmosphere and friendly service. I am a fan to say the least."}
{"text":"Fluffy buns, Chaing Mai Curry, BYOB wine....the best! 4 app plates and 3 entrees for $70 with tip, can't beat it!"}
{"text":"This is my number one place for pork buns in Pittsburgh! If you eat pork, you can't miss them.

The noodles and curry are delicious too. My favorites are the street noodle number 2, the chiang mai curry and the kee mao. 

The two downsides of this place are the lines for dinner on the weekends and their lack of consistency on spicy levels. The pork buns and noodles are so good, though, that I think noodlehead still deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Such a deal too- $23 for a fabulous meal with two noodle dishes and the pork bun appetizer which is outrageous. Stopped by the local wine shop beforehand, BYOB. I wish I lived next to this place."}
{"text":"Great food. Great ambience! Pretty cheap too. Our favorite by far is there Steamed pork buns and Chiang Mai curry. 
A few things to know before you go-
- Only cash accepted. There's an ATM in the back.
- Weekends are pretty busy. There's usually a wait."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with my friend upon her suggestion and the food was very good - not too salty or sweet. The price started from $6 and the portion was pretty large we had to take some home. Loved the ambience with exotic interior settings. Fine service."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for over three years, and it's been consistently wonderful. My favorite is the Street Noodle #1, which has the best fried chicken in it. Over a bed of deliciously sauced noodles and Bol Chou sits many pieces of Thai Fried Chicken, which has a reasonable amount of batter and crisp. I highly recommend this dish, as well as the See Yew. Although this place is cash only, the ambience is relaxing and comfortable."}
{"text":"I recently ate at Noodlehead for a friend's birthday.  This is a casual, delicious noodle place, the prices are ridiculously cheap for what they offer, and the fact that it's BYOB (designed to give you options and save you money) is what makes me love them.  What made me love them more, was that they treated my girlfriends and I so well on our recent visit.  We had a lot of crazy demands for a noodle place, lots of wine to put in the cooler, we brought our own cake, we were loud. The staff was super accommodating, they even lit candles on the cake to surprise my friend!  I love the food at Noodlehead, I love the prices, I love the service, keep doing everything you're doing."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai flavors.  My favorite: street noodle 1, with just the right cilantro and lime overtones."}
{"text":"Best Pad See Yew ever! The service was very fast- the place was packed when we got there, but we didn't have to wait very long for a table. I would give it 5 stars, but it was SO noisy- that's a bummer. Great food though!"}
{"text":"Food: 5/6
I've enjoyed every item on the menu at least once, and it all is great. Spice level is legitimately hot if you go 2 or higher, and the ingredients they use are fresh and vibrant.

Great decor, and a really down-to-Earth and relaxing feel. The lighting makes it feel cozy, yet modern. Really the only reason this isn't a 6/6 is because sometimes I don't like the chairs/booths.

All items on the menu are pretty cheap, $9 being the most expensive thing. 
X-Factor: 5/6
This place screams inventive and unique. Also, GET THE STEAMED BUNS; they are the best thing I've ever eaten, and I've eaten a lot of things."}
{"text":"Food is not that great for the price. Not very friendly service either. The Asian fusion style is not my type. I guess the the unique environment is the selling point, but I am not really sold."}
{"text":"Is Thai Thai?

Little Serow (DC) and Pok Pok (PDX) aside, American Thai fare is standard stuff. Noodlehead is 4sure better than average but not on their level..

Proteins are the first issue at N'Head: dry and salty chicken, old and gamey steak, simple pork.. the shrimp's the best protein they serve. The second issue is spice scale: 3 is barely spicy for me and 4 was only sinus clearing.. the descriptions are way off. 4 = \"Asian hot\" at Noodlehead but it'd be a palate cleanser at DC's Little Serow. No pain = no gain

The small menu of main dishes offers fresh Pad Thai that's complex, crunchy, and overall excellent, among the best I've tried. A unique lemon wedge adds oft-absent acid. The Kew Mew is a sugary take on drunken noodles but the bok choy fails to provide enough bitterness. It lacks acid and the large basil clumps fail to balance the sweetness save for the one bite where they dominate your fork.

Apps are similarly limited. The singular sticky buns are heavy on fish sauce and cilantro, and the beef is simple compared to DC's complex Toki Underground chicken version. The grilled beef app is overcooked strips slathered in cilantro and fish sauce, appropriately spicy but one note.

Would return for the pad Thai. Would eat the buns again. Wouldn't make the trip home for it. American Thai is not Thai."}
{"text":"There is always a line out the door, I now understand why. I usually get the See Yew with chicken and gluten free sauce and it is amazing. Anytime I'm in Shady Side I make it a point to stop in."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a great price. I used to come to this space when y was Typhoon a few years ago and they have brought their best dish forward to Noodlehead: the Chang Mai curry. The curry sauce is rich, decadent, and flavorful. The crispy noodles on top of the dish add a nice crunch. My only complaint is that the spice scale is not entirely consistent from one time to the next - sometimes a two is very mild, sometimes I have to pound the water."}
{"text":"Delicious but a bit of a wait. Worth it though for noodles done perfectly. Make sure to Bring something to pair with dishes."}
{"text":"Got the street noodles #1, pork belly buns. Good price, good portions, good atmosphere. Food was delicious.

Also, you seat yourself, and it's cash only."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is one of the best Thai restaurants in the area. They give you very large portions for a great price. Although it's cash only and usually a bit of a wait on a weekend night, it's well worth it. The only thing I wish is they had a few more items on the menu with more vegetables but I'm sure they keep prices down with their same menu."}
{"text":"The best noodles around hands down. Cash only but there is an atm on premise. Sweet potatoes triangle are delightful.  Street noodles amazing , curry good spiced to your liking. Ask server how hot the spices are today as they vary from day to day in my opinion"}
{"text":"Great casual place to meet up with a friend that's also a BYOB (with a reasonable 50 cents/person corkage fee) so that's also a nice feature if that's your thing.

The food is solid, and you have to select a spice level (from 0-5). I ordered the Kee Mao, and it was spectacular - basil, garlic and soy tasting - perfect flavors, but to me it was a tad salty - then again, I hardly eat salt. 

 I've had it at 2 spice levels. Let it be known that I like spicy food - but when I ordered it at \"3\" (medium) thinking I was being conservative, it blew me away - mouth burning, and 6 glasses of water throughout the meal. I did not expect this! Needless to say, the next time I got it, I ordered it at a \"1\" (somewhat spicy) spice level...and although I felt like a weakling for my order, this was hot but perfect.

Tip: Go very conservative with the spice level - at least with this dish...and remember to bring cash (this is a \"Cash Only\" place)

Overall, the food is solid, the atmosphere is casual and never rushed, and it's a great place to meet up with just about anyone. The menu is limited, but they seem to do everything well, and the prices are more than reasonable - when I went there, just about every meal was $9 or less. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've always been a bit skeptical of people who tell me about an \"AMAZING\" thai place because it usually all ends up tasting the same. However, I have to say that Noodlehead way exceeded my expectations and I am itching to go back. 

I ordered the Pad See Ew and was pleasantly surprised by how fresh the noodles were-- most Thai restaurants serve you a sticky clump of noodles saturated in the same boring sauce. But the noodles in this dish were not clumped together, and the sauce was perfect in proportion to the noodles. I also had a taste of the other noodles-- the Chiang Mai Curry noodles are also an awesome choice. Actually, you probably wouldn't go wrong with any of the noodle dishes there. 

With regards to the spicy scale, I ordered \"THAI HOT\" and my face was a little bit sweaty. But if you love spicy food, I'd definitely recommend you go for a 5. I didn't think \"THAI HOT\" was really that spicy at all."}
{"text":"The food was fast and nice with reasonable price. The waitress is very friendly, and the atmosphere does feel like Thailand. However, I ordered the spiciest Chiangmai curry, but it's not spicy enough for Thai person. Happy with everything else though."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is consistently very good.  Quality at a very reasonable price.  Everything I've had here has tasted great.  I particularly like the street noodles with the Thai fried chicken... nothing fancy and maybe boring to some, but yum."}
{"text":"Cash only. No phone. Great food. Great price point. 

Takeout is available, but you have to order in person.

Gluten Free options are available, just ask.

Great aesthetic and great food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! We had the Pork belly Steamed Buns, Street Noodle 1 and Kee Mao Shrimp. All had differing flavors, and all were absolutely delicious. The prices are totally reasonable (nothing more than $9) and portions are more than adequate. 
The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was due to the service. It wasn't... bad. It was just... not great. We waited quite a while for drink refills (like until we were totally finished with our meals), and our server really didn't seem to care whether or not we enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"Any place that's cash only I tend to stay optimistic with because their product usually holds up enough that being cash only doesn't drive away business. And noodle head holds up. 20 dollars for a date and you can BYOB. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Really delicious food here. The staff is pretty nice and I definitely will visit again! 
The only bad this is its cash only. They have an ATM but that can sometimes be an inconvenience."}
{"text":"Becoming one of my favorite restaurants in the Burgh. Have been here 4x and have had a wonderful experience each visit. 

Appetizers- have had the pork steamed buns, pig wings, and the thai fried chicken. recommend all.

Noodles- The pad Thai and pad see yew are what I typically go for on a main course. even as a big eater I brought home leftovers.

One of the  better BYOB deals in the city.

two thumbs way way up!"}
{"text":"We really like the food but the server has been mean to us on two occasions. Both times we were either with our baby (a year ago) or (now) toddler. We are not disruptive and we always clean up any additional messes, so I don't know what the problem is except maybe they don't like kids. It's just not fun to be treated that way as a customer. 

Update for parents: I got a kind personal e-mail from someone at Noodlehead saying that she likes kids and encouraged us to come back and ask for her specifically--Pam G. Might be worth a shot."}
{"text":"I found the food to be a little on the greasy side. For whatever reason the skin of my chicken was coming off and it just was odd. For the price you could do better. Actually I've been to plenty of cheaper place with much better AUTHENTIC prepared Asian-Fusion."}
{"text":"Great food. Super busy with shows they have good food. Excellent price$$. BOYB is alway the best. Small menus but yummy food. 
Parking tough but find a place to park and walk a few blocks. Alway nice to walk in this area of town."}
{"text":"It is the first place I would think of when I'm craving for noodles. Most dishes taste pretty close to authentic Thai noodles. At least the food here helps me not miss Thailand so much. :) My favorites are love boat and beef soup."}
{"text":"Steamed pork buns are my favorite app anywhere.  I pretty much only ever get Pad Kee Mao at every Thai place I go to and this is among the very best I have had. The fact that they don't take credit cards and they have no phone prevent me from eating here every week. It is silly to not be able to call in a take out order. Still give it five stars though because the food is that good."}
{"text":"I came here quite often and their noodles are really great! The finger foods are great too! I love the pulled-pork steamed buns! So great! And the fried chicken is really tasty and not so greasy! But it was my first to try the pork dumplings this time...ughhh not so good, I thought it would taste like siu-mai, but it's not even close...but other than that, everything is great!"}
{"text":"Thought this place was very good for lunch. I really liked the small menu which made it easy to figure out what to choose from. I had the Chiang Mai Curry, it was presented nicely and hade great aroma and flavor accompanied by just the right amount of heat( spiciness level) I went with medium and it was easily handled by my mouth. I also tried the hot pulled pork bun appetizer which also was tasty but hard to only eat one so if you are sort of hungry maybe plan to not hate this app.

The only thing that was sort of irritating was the seating arrangements. I'm in Pittsburgh, not Chiang Mai, so I didn't appreciate sitting on the mildly uncomfortable stool with no back to it. The design was thoughtful but I need some better sitting options. It was also way too cold even after eating my curry. A number of people in the place kept their coats on since it was so chilly. Anyhow I would come back here again for lunch or a lighter dinner, since the food is tasty, service was quick, and the price is right."}
{"text":"I came around 6:30 on a Friday night with two friends and there was no wait. It is seat yourself, which is great in concept but I was a little turned off by my server coming to spray and wipe my table after we had already sat down. 

Our server was pretty abrupt - I asked her for her recommendation for a noodle and she went on to impatiently recite, word for word, what was written on the menu. Not helpful. Someone at the next table over asked about the two different kinds of hot sauces on the table and she blurted \"you try\" before spinning on her heels and leaving.

The wait for food was a little long but reasonable. I tried the Steamed roasted pork buns and the Sokuthai, which were both really good. The other two in my party weren't so impressed by their choices, however. One said \"I could get a bigger tastier serving for less elsewhere\" and the other left hungry despite sharing an appetizer and having a $9 noodle because he has a typical guy appetite and the servings are a bit smaller than other comparable places.

I would come back for a meal during off-peak hours but the food and the service did not merit the growing line out the door as we left."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here tonight and were both quite pleased with our meals.  We got an order of the pork buns based on the other reviewers recommendations, and they were quite tasty and unlike anything else I've ever eaten, so I would definitely recommend giving them a try.

For our main course we shared an order of chicken pad thai and see yew both at a spice level of 3 / 5.  I quite enjoy eating really spicy foods and surprisingly \"hot\" actually equated to quite a spicy dish.  Both dishes were were tasty and large enough to save some for later.

The two majors downsides are that this restaurant only takes cash (which makes a restaurant seem cheap and generally leads to me avoiding it) and the seating leaves much to be desired in terms of comfort.  I'm tall, so the small, low stools and low table were quite uncomfortable to sit at.

Otherwise, an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"The street noodles #1 and curry were excellent.  When asian restaurants like this one don't fill their menu with 100 similarly tasting dishes and instead focus on a few really good menu items, this is what it tastes like."}
{"text":"I like the price, the atmosphere, and the food, but the crowds and the cash-only factor keep me from coming back. I never have cash on me, so I always end up going to Mad Mex instead!"}
{"text":"Pork belly buns and the See Yew are highlights. The curry is close second. If you aren't bringing a bottle of wine, get the iced tea- it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Their menu is simplistic and it's easy to decide what you want to order. Since discovering this place I've been back 5 times. They're almost always packed, but if you don't have a larger party of 5 or 6 you will be seated very quickly. You can also BYOB. 

My favorite dish is the See Yew with chicken. It's delicious! I've found myself craving it now and then and I have to go back for more. Their prices for their main dishes are also pretty reasonable. Most noodle plates are $9, and it's a big helping. The food also comes out super quickly. The longest I've had to wait was probably 10 minutes for my food.

The only issue I have is with their appetizers. I wish they weren't as expensive or gave you more for your money. Under \"snacks\" we ordered the spring rolls for $4. Only 2 came and they weren't any bigger than my thumb. We haven't ordered any else since.

Quick tips: bring cash they don't except cards! They also don't have a phone!"}
{"text":"Reasonable prices. Generous portions. Fun staff and atmosphere. I'd recommend this place to anyone! Oh, and byob!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and both times the food was great! The service is ok, and the good came out quickly. The portion sizes are very good for the amount you pay. The selection is somewhat limited but they have all the staple noodle dishes. 

The spice chart goes from 1-5. This time u got a 3 and it was about perfect for me. If you are used to the 1-10 scale the 3 is like a7-8. 

Thus place is great for a casual meal just make sure you bring cash! There is an ATM if you forget to bring cash."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh so far - there are a couple reasons for 4 stars instead of 5 - NO THAI ICED TEA. This is a staple especially with extra spicy food, and it's strange that it's missing from the menu. And no phone! So you can't call in orders, or call to see if they are open on a holiday, etc. I don't even care that they are cash only - just get the Thai tea and a phone!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites I always stop by when I'm home. Very unique atmosphere, wait longer so you can get a window seat or sit outside. The pork belly buns are a nom-negotiable. Only downside is it's cash only."}
{"text":"This place is not your typical mom and pop asian noodle shop. Ambiance is very hipster and trendy, good for date night. There was a 10-15 min wait when we got there at around 8:30 PM on Saturday night. Although they have a bar area to sit, it is important to note that they do not serve any alcoholic drinks (BYOB for $0.50 recycling fee). We ordered the steamed pork buns to start, which were of the pulled pork variety, a bit different from the traditional slab of pork belly (but the same cut of meat). They were oily, flavorful goodness. I have had better buns (fluffier, softer ones) in NYC but these were decent. Anyway, on to the noodles! We ordered the Chiang Mai curry noodles, which were very creamy and flavorful. This dish is already fairly spicy to begin with so I would caution adding spice to this one. The curry noodles' spiciness probably even surpassed the other two dishes we ordered with a spice level of 2. We also ordered the Sukothai and Love Boat because the menu advertises ordering one dish as a snack and two for a meal. Honestly, I would have been satisfied with one of the smaller $6 bowls on its own and was unable to finish the large Chiang Mai curry bowl. Of the two $6 bowls, I liked the Sukothai better. Sort of annoyingly, this place only takes cash, so be prepared when you come - or there is an ATM located in the back of the restaurant. All in all, an enjoyable meal and good noodles!"}
{"text":"I love finding delicious local finds in new places that I've never been! My friends recommended this joint and we came on a Thursday night. I love the decor - very rustic with a lot of wooden paneling and hardwood accents. The menu is Thai inspired and this restaurant is cash only. The waitstaff was pretty friendly and we quickly ordered the Kee Mao, Chiang Mai Curry, and Street Noodle #2. The Chiang Mai Curry looks very similar to one of my favorite types of curry noodle soup dishes especially with the topping of crispy egg noodles. The Kee Mao looked similar to drunken noodles. I loved my Street Noodle #2 - so much tempura shrimp, crispy and spiced noodles and some fresh vegetables. The noodles had good chew and the spicy level was right on. Service is quick and portions sizes are comparable. I will definitely come back if I'm in Pittsburgh again!"}
{"text":"This place would get 5 stars if they took credit cards, took take out orders via phone and allowed substitutions on the menu.  But despite their noodle soup nazi ways, it's worth it to stop in if you have time to sit down and enjoy the ambiance that has been created.  It's a lovely wooden room with unique lighting and decor.  The tables range in comfort level, the chairs that accompany the bench along the wall are definitely too high for the tiny tables, but this is Thai street food so comfort isn't exactly part of the theme.  I like to sit at the bar that looks out the window.  I've tried almost the whole menu, it's all flawless.  I sort of get why they don't do substitutions, but just once I want to have the shrimp tempura on the other rice noodle dish, maybe some day. Every dish is bursting with so much flavor, it really leaves everywhere comparable in the dust on that front.  The ground pork in a spicy lime broth, is one of the smaller bowls but to me, that is the perfect soup meal.  I'm obsessed."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is definitely one of my favorite Shadyside restaurants. They have a small menu, but don't let that deter you. Everything is deliciousssss. Pad Thai is a classic and absolutely wonderful. I recommend the See Yew.
You can order spicy levels 1-5. I personally order a 4 or 5 each time because I love spicy food. My friends who have ordered a 1 said it has a very slight bite but very manageable for those who don't like the hot stuff. 
The atmosphere is wonderful, and I love the decor. 
Don't forget, they are BYOB! And it's only a 50-cent/person recycling fee. 

Just keep in mind, they have no phone, don't take reservations, and are cash only. Take out is available, but you have to order in person. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Poor quality takeout. Ordered street noodles #2 and got a watery/liquidy mess with spongy tofu. The lady up front spoke to me rather sententiously, which I wouldn't have minded had the food been good. Save your time and go up to Bryant st."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is amazing! I think I've ordered everything on the menu at this point and they have never disappointed! Their bao buns are out of this world. Keep in mind that they are cash only but have an atm on location. They are also byob which I love"}
{"text":"Very good decor and ambience and the food will not disappoint you. The pork bun is very tasty and I ordered the street noodle #1 which is of a sweet sour flavour. I did enjoy a lot. I think the spicy level
Is generally higher than other American this restaurant, which in this way means it's more authentic than others. Worth trying.
Btw. They only accept cash but now arm is available."}
{"text":"Positives: Super trendy and hip aura, really good food with decent price, friendly service, allowed tofu substitution for the foods (vegetarian-friendly). The pork belly steamed buns were amazing and the spiciness level was exactly what I expected.

Negatives: May be too crowded on a weekend night, wait time might be really long. Some of the seating areas is awkward (the ones along the side of the window)

Overall this is a great place and would go again anytime. It's pretty magical"}
{"text":"I wish I could write this place off but there are no alternatives in the vicinity that I care for. There's nothing wrong with the food, price or staff, I just wish they would make a few concessions to the customer. I never like cash only. But the no telephone, no advance take-out order setup is puzzling at best. Having no phone line is something I've never seen in a restaurant like this, I just don't get it. Many restaurants of similar size and quality have no issue pulling it off. Parking is hassle enough much less being forced to stand around awkwardly. I like the fare here, a lot in fact, but they've lost business on many occasions simply because needless hurdles were in the way."}
{"text":"Kee Mao tofu is one of the greatest things on the planet. It's a contender for the one thing you would take to a deserted island question. Eating it made me appreciate life more. If I'm ever on death row, this will be my last meal.

Atmosphere is great. People there are great. Prices are great. Cash-only so come prepared."}
{"text":"My friend and I got there a little earlier than opening (noon) and I can honestly say by 12:08 there were at least 10 tables total and more coming. The atmosphere is really nice and the service is great. I got the beef soup at medium spiciness and it had a really nice kick that I appreciated but didn't make me hate the soup because my head was on fire. It was flavorful and great quality for the price. My friend comes here often and I'm now certain that, if I'm in the area, I will too."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, very casual and laid back. However, service was extremely slow and there really is only 3 things on the menu for vegetarians. Our noodles were not  flavorful at all.

One thing I would REALLY LIKE TO POINT OUT: we were waiting by the cashier area to get a table and I could see into the kitchen and the woman sorting through the noodles was NOT wearing gloves!! She was just opening packets of noodles, taking them out with her bare hands and separating handfuls of them as if to measure how much goes in each plate...you be the judge."}
{"text":"Wowy wow wow!  Noodlehead is our go to after work or on the weekend. No other joint like it. For about $20 bucks you can get a couple of delicious noodle dishes. We typically do the tofu and it is awesome. The wait can look intimidating but they move you quickly so stick around. BYOB with a $0.50 recycle fee. Take-away is super quick even though you cant call ahead (they have no phone). 

I love the pad thai (number 3 spicy) and the Chiang Mai Curry (number 2 spicy). Sweet potato appetizer is decent."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant of all time!! I'm not a fan of spicy food, but they accommodate well! They have the best steam buns ever, and always, wonderful customer service! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and DELICIOUS food! The instant I walked in I was captivated by the earthy yet polished environment. Service was wonderful and I didnt wait long for my meal.  

My only negative opinion would be the spice levels, even a 2 was wayyy to spicy. So make sure you know what you can handle."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Not only is the food delicious but the vibe is great, facility is nice and fun, and all of the staff are super friendly.  I got the noodles with basil, bok choy, and shrimp and it was incredibly good!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a reasonably priced meal. There is usually a wait during the busy hours, but it moved fast for me, which was less than 10 minutes. Large portions, BYOB and it's cash only, but if you forget cash then they do have an ATM in the back."}
{"text":"Noodlehead never lets me down. The only small inconvenience is that this place is CASH ONLY but they do have an ATM on-site.

I always get the pad see yew or pad kee mao. They're both very good. I tend to get spice level 3 (out of 5) because I like things with more of a kick... but if you're not feeling too adventurous, play it safe. Honestly, there are slight inconsistencies with the spice levels (presumably due to different chefs) but the food is of good quality nonetheless, so I'm not complaining!

I also love the steamed pork buns! They're simple but delicious. The fried sweet potato triangles are addictive too!

I've tried my friends' street noodles and green curry, and I'm honestly convinced that Noodlehead can never let me down.

Even the interior of the place is so nice! It's very modern. I love the lighting fixtures and the wooden tones.

The service is always amazing too! Everyone is so friendly and quick to refill your water vases.

This is a must-go-place for anyone who lives in or is visiting Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here during our visit to Pittsburgh. Nice trendy little hipster spot. Keep in mind there is only street parking and they will not let you sit until the entire party arrives. Also they only accept cash, but there is an ATM on site. We arrived around 3PM and the place was popping. I can only imagine they are super packed during prime lunch/dinner hours. 

Overall the food and flavors were delicious. Starting with apps, I did not enjoy the pork dumplings (too much of a mushy texture for me) or the pulled pork sandwich. That being said, my nephew loves the pork sandwich. I think, due to appearance I though they would taste like sui mai and Peking duck, very much not the case.

For entrees we ordered the below:

Chiang Mai Curry: loved the curry, but the noodles were a little tough. Saved the curry and had it over rice for leftovers at home. Yum! 

Green Curry Linguini: absolutely delicious flavor with a little kick. Again, saved the curry sauce and had it again with rice at home ;) so good. 

Beef soup: good flavor, tender pieces of beef.

Street Noodles: nothing to write home about. 

Pad Sew Ew: YUUUUMMMM!!! Best dish we had."}
{"text":"This place lives up to all the hype. Great food, prices and aesthetics. We dropped by for an early dinner around 3:30pm and were immediately seated. The waiter brought us a fresh bottle of cold Pittsburgh H2-uh O and our menus.  I had my eyes set on the pork buns and dumplings. We also ordered the Shrimp pad thai and Spring rolls. Our waiter offered spices in the dish or on the side for a good reason, so we opted for some on the side. Shortly after our orders were placed, the food arrived piping hot and fresh. The pork buns were perfect, tender, flavorable and not enough. The dumplings melted right in my mouth and were also full of flavor.  The spring rolls were still very hot, crunchy, flaky, packed full of deliciousness. Finally, the Shrimp pad thai was one of the best I've had, with a good portion size.  There were mounds of moist, flavor filled noodles, complimented with the right amount of sauces, shrimp, fried eggs and bean sprouts. We tried a tad bit of the hot spices, which hit the mouth cavity with stabbing pains, cleared the sinuses and watered the eyes for a bit. So whether you eat in or take out, this is truly a good spot for some of the best thai in the Burgh."}
{"text":"If you've been frustrated by the other dreadful \"Thai\" restaurants in Pittsburgh, you'll be EXTREMELY pleased with Noodlehead. They actually know what Thai spicy really is! I searched for a \"while\" (specifically I've been to Nicky's Thai, Smiling Banana Leaf, Thai Cuisine on Liberty Ave, Silk Elephant), and none of those compare.

I've had 4 dishes here: Pad Thai, Chiang Mai Curry, See Yew and Pork buns.

Btw, Silk Elephant is also \"OK\" Thai, but if you are torn between the two, go to Noodlehead. As a side-point I also HIGHLY recommend Pusadee's Garden in Lawrenceville. It's BYOB and Thai spicy/flavorful also, but isn't cash only and, oh yea they actually have a phone number :-) The downside is they are a bit more expensive.... So if you're ballin' choose the Garden."}
{"text":"It's cash only and BYOB. People linger here, and they will only seat you if your entire party is present. It's a small menu, but you're able to change the spicy-ness of all the dishes and the protein. Definitely go if you like spice! It's a very cute, and chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Very small menu but good quality homemade noodles. True to spice so order modestly if you don't like spicy food. Usually there is a wait but it's a very trendy spot so just plan accordingly...we got ice cream next door at Millie's while we waited then took home leftovers-- just as good the next day. The noodles and sauces were excellent and I would definitely go back again when I have the time to wait. Takeout might be a good option too. CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Love this place sooo much that curry was delicious ! The vibe of this restaurant was awesome, dimmed lights Byob ! What else could a girl ask for! The place doesn't accept cards but has an atm in the back HOW CONVENIENT LMBO! I would go here again"}
{"text":"I like this place. I don't LOVE this place, but I think it is solidly good. I do not understand waiting in line outside for this food, however, but I'm also not really willing to do that anywhere at this stage in my life. I'm also slightly annoyed by restaurants that don't take credit, however, it does not appear to the hurting Noodlehead's business given their wild popularity so more power to them, I suppose. If you go at an unpopular time, it is definitely worth a taste. Just don't forget your cash."}
{"text":"There is something for everybody (meat or vegan) (spicy or mild).  Every single item is very tasty.  How can you not give a 5-star to a place that makes beansprouts sexy and moist? Bok choy tasted like a Parisian Brussels sprouts. Portions large and atmosphere cheerful due to many students visiting this restaurant. Warning - they do not dumb down the spices - No 2 (out of 5) is really spicy."}
{"text":"This place is so outstanding and so affordably priced that it feels foolish to go to any fancier restaurant.

The wait is worth it; efficient service + impeccable food once you're in. Dynamite as takeout also!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I haven't written a review for here yet. I mean...it's not like I eat here at least twice a month or anything.... I tried this place when my sister coincidentally stumbled upon it a few years ago when it first opened and have been coming back ever since. I love the atmosphere, it's not your typical Thai place. The interior is very rustic and almost industry with dark woods and open steel. It's definitely a crowd gathering kind of place with light background music and people chattering away all around. The entrance can get a little crowded if there is a long wait because theres no 'real' waiting area, just the chairs and whatever room there is in front of the counter. They definitely go for a simple approach to their menu and their business operations.They're called Noodlehead - don't expect a variety of rice dishes, or any at all actually.

STREET NOODLE #1 --
My go to, always. It doesn't matter when I come here but I always seem to order this even when I come in with the intention of 'trying something new'. I think I have a slight obsession with the fried chicken and they give you a pretty generous amount. The noodles are thin rice noodles, the ones they typically use for pad thai, fried chicken, bok choy, and a sauce that's got a nice kick to it. If your a fan of spicy I would recommend this one. I usually get it at a three, which they consider to be medium, and I always end up with a bit of the food sweats cause of hotness factor. Not complaining about it

CHIANG MAI CURRY NOODLE --
So one of my friends got this dish and I'm a huge sucker for curry and noodles - low and behold this is the best of both worlds (please ignore the Hannah Montana reference). It's a thicker noodle, it's an egg noodle rather than a rice noodle so it is less prone to getting all fat and soggy when you let it sit for an extended period of time. Make it's a little easier to take to go or take home if you need a doggy bag. The flavor is great - it's not too sweet and has got a nice spice factor. They also serve with a birds nest of something fried for added texture. I would like to see some kind of veggies in it, but I enjoy it as is. Pro tip if you've got a little inner fatty like me, if you happen to not finish your dish and take it hope - throw in some rice to the excess sauce. It's the bomb, it makes me drool. 

PORK BELLY STEAM BUNS --
Best rendition of pork belly buns I've had at a Pittsburgh restaurant yet. Whenever I come here I always make it a point to order them. The meat is always tender and shredded to really nice thin pieces so when you bit into the bun you're not struggling to rip through with your teeth like a rabid animal. The bun isn't too thick or doughy, which in my opinion is one of the leading issues with most pork bun attempts. It's also got a nice sweetness to it, which the second issue with most pork bun attempts is that there is zero flavor to the bun. Noodlehead doesn't seem to have this issue. They garnish with cilantro and a nice pickled cucumber, I'm assuming its pickled in a rice vinegar. I personally think they should try carrots and daikon as an alternative, but the cucumbers are still delicious as they are. I would recommend these bad boys (2 to an order) as a appetizer. 

The waitstaff has always been really good. They're always crowded so they tried to do quick turn overs, but I don't think I've ever been rushed. This place is BYOB also and they're always really good about asking you if you need them to cork your bottles and bring you separate glasses. I will say though that their hostesses are less than stellar. There have been a few occasions I've come in and they were really short with their words, borderline just plain rude. But one or two shall not bring down the whole establishment...

I've tried a lot of the dishes here, most of the appetizer and a number of their entrees. My overall opinion is that Noodlehead is a winner. It won a spot on Pittsburgh's top new restaurants because it's delicious. It's pretty good food for a really good price, less than $10 a dish. They haven't done me wrong yet - I'm a regular and will continue to be one. Key things to take note: BYOB, cash only (ATM inside), no telephone (walk in to order take out), no reservation!"}
{"text":"I love this place pork buns are a must and the noodle bowls are super as well. Staff are great and the food is wonderful will keep coming back for more !"}
{"text":"Great place, very nice atmosphere, reasonably priced. Been there many times and service is consistently pleasant and food is always good.  Love the Steamed Pork Belly Buns!"}
{"text":"Always delicious...you select the perfect heat...don't forget the steamed pork buns!!!"}
{"text":"This is my all-time favorite Thai spot! Cheap, super delicious dishes and good service. The atmosphere is hipsterish yet welcoming and casual, and they also have a couple outdoor tables. It's BYOB so it's a great place for a date and a bottle of wine or a six pack with friends. It's also cash only so be prepared. My boyfriend and I go almost every week and we order the same thing every time: the pad se ew with chicken. It's always done perfectly and the portion is nice and big, especially for the price."}
{"text":"Good price and big portion! The interior was nicely decorated as well, although service was a little slow on the Sunday morning we were there.
I had the Street Noodle #1 with the fried chicken, #1 hotness- very flavorful and delicious! The lemongrass ice tea also came with one free re-fill, which the waitress automatically offered without me asking. Will return to try others if I'm back again.

Cash only!"}
{"text":"Noodlehead can provide the best meal for under $10. Portion sizes are perfect for one person, food is excellent, and the space is beautiful. Totally worth the cash-only policy and bench seating. Vegetarian-friendly is also a plus!"}
{"text":"I tried this place last week. The food was good but the portion was a little small. The seating was kind of uncomfortably low and the tables were really small. My friend and I couldn't finish our food, so we asked for Togo boxes, at first he said we were not allowed to togo our dishes, then when we started to get upset, he went to the kitchen and gave us a couple of containers. After we packed our food, we got the bill and saw that they charged us for each togo box. This restaurant has absolutely ridiculous policies."}
{"text":"A little yucky.
We had 4 different dishes...underwhelmed.
Such promise : ("}
{"text":"I have NEVER had a bad experience here. For customer service, the staff is great. For food, everything is always excellent. And you really cannot beat any meal under $10.
I've introduced so many people to Noodlehead and they all love their experience there."}
{"text":"First off, cash only. Didn't pay attention but luckily had cash on me. It's BYOB which is great but I didn't know that until I arrived. Loved the food. Pork buns were awesome. An order is two buns. The street noodles were great too. Food had some spice for sure which was great. Everything is $9 or less which is better."}
{"text":"food was 7/10, however the service was absolutely atrocious.  the place is understaffed and nobody took our order or even offered to get us drinks for 15 minutes. the couple sitting next to us had been waiting even longer.  this is such a shame for a restaurant to be held back its service, of all things."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh surprisingly has a lot of great Thai food and Noodlehead is probably at the top.  In terms of price and taste, this place can't be beat.  I've been here countless times and have tried probably every dish on the menu and I've never been disappointed.  My go-to is the Chiang Mai, which I usually get with a 5/5 spice rating.  With a 5 spice level, they don't make it overbearing so you can still taste the flavors  of the food.  The only downside is that it's cash only(atm inside though) and there's usually a long wait.

Chiang Mai - 10/10
Thai fried chicken - 7.5/10
Steamed buns - 9/10
Street noodle #2 - 8.5/10"}
{"text":"I love the veggie rolls and the pad se ew.  The food is good and inexpensive.  I wish the chairs were more comfortable and that they took credit cards.  Otherwise, this restaurant is really amazing!"}
{"text":"Noodle head is absolutely my favorite restaurant. The food is amazing and very affordable. The atmosphere is chill and earthy. All the servers are really nice and are helpful with any questions. To make it even better it is BYOB! It is cash only, but there is an atm in the back of the restaurant. I highly recommend the pork buns, they are like little clouds of heaven with amazing pork on them. My favorite dishes are the pad see ew and chiang mai curry :) their chicken and shrimp are both so fresh. It is truly hard to go wrong when picking a meal here. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Noodlehead for multiple reasons: fresh ingredients, BYOB, cozy atmosphere, and quick service! If you go there on the weekend you can usually expect a little bit of a wait. I always go for the pork belly steamed buns as an appetizer. It comes with 2 of them and I've honestly never met anyone who doesn't like these things! I love the See Yew noodles with tofu for an entree. They have a spice rating from 1-5, I always stick with a 3 and it's a little spicy, but never takes away from the flavor. 

For the BYOB they have a 50 cent recycling fee per person. Make sure to bring CASH. Although they do have an atm in the back of the restaurant in case you need it!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai restaurant In Pittsburgh with the best prices. I am pretty much obsessed with Thai food and usually eat it about once a week. My favorite is the Chi Mai Curry noodles. I got #3 on the spicy scale, and they don't skimp on the spice here. I've had the street noodles 2 and the green curry linguine which are also excellent. The place is also BYOB which makes it even better."}
{"text":"AMAZING! The service was very fast and the food is to die for, the portion sizes are very generous. Try the Pork Belly Steamed Buns!!"}
{"text":"excellent food for a great price. I love the Chang mai, green curry, and the street noodles! You won't be disappointed! and BYOB!!"}
{"text":"Noodlehead is a restaurant that took the simplicity of Boat Noodles and combined it with great service! 

The food was delicious,quick,cheap and very unique! 

They don't take reservations and rightfully so because it gets really crowded during dinner time. Waits are usually 30-40 mins, so try not to go on an empty stomach! 

Overall, a very pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"It was okay. The hostess was rude, the server was fine. Pad Thai was unimpressive, the street noodles were pretty good. I won't return because it's not worth a second visit, but it wasn't terrible."}
{"text":"I LOVE Noodlehead. Okay, it is true, I do love this place. Chic interior, delicious food, generous (but not insane) portions, fast service, BYOB, everything is always fresh and fasty. I would recommend this place in a second. 

My only complaint is they need a phone and some options to get more veg in meals because, as a veggie lover, I would totally love to have options that allow me to get more veg in my dish. I do love to get the summer rolls (they are vegetarian for anyone wondering). If Noodlehead can add a veggie option (sub for protein?) I'd say this spot is 5 star.

Any dish you choose is going to be great, but if you're looking for a suggestion the fried chicken (available avid a side or in a street noodle dish) has been a crowd pleaser with everyone I've dined with here.

Edit: Noodlehead took the time to message me to let me know they can substitute veggies for a protein if you ask. Fab news! 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Well yelp nation I am back after a long hiatus. I guess my pontificating kinda wore thin even on me so I too a little break for about two years. I mark my return with a trip and review to Noodle Head in Shadyside. I've been to NH a number of times and I feel it is about time I pile in the praise they deserve. 

To start, as I usually do, let's discuss the decor. The interior can only be described as cool. Not pretentious cool but a pleasant mix of plastic seating, to reflect their roots in Thai street food, and dark wood. I felt very comfortable, as did the hipsters sitting next to me, and the businessmen next to them. 


I also live NHs bar options. It's BYO so if the wine sucks, it'd your fault. To go with the BYO liquor license they do have a corkage fee, but it's only fifty cents a person  which I think is very reasonable. 

The food at NH is amazing. I am a fan if the sliced beef appetizer as well as the steamed pork belly buns. For an entree my standby us the Ching Mai curry. The flavor of the curry is out if this world. Pickled veg with coconut milk and a crazy amount of spice. Fantastic. Don't fear spice here. They utilize a 1-5 heat scale (I'm a 4) but even in the hottest dishes the spice doesn't overwhelm the flavor of the rest of the food.  

The only thing they lose a star for is service. The staff always seems to be inconvenienced by the guests. They aren't mean or rude but they give off the impression that they would rather be doing something else. 

All in all I love NH. So many times Thai food just gets caught in an inferno if chili heat that the food loses all it's flavor and you pay out the rectum (literally) the next day.  Not so here and despite being cash only I plan in going back. Often."}
{"text":"amazing simple dishes for great prices! Never really was attracted to noodle spots and did this place complete on a whim. Turned out that I will be going back soon. Great service. No crazy frills other than quickly made meals that taste fantastic.  Pork buns are good would like one more for the price, but it's cool. Ordered Chiang mai curry, FIRE!  also, kee mao, which I thought was better than the mai curry.
Either way awesome little spot that got a space in my stomach."}
{"text":"I've been coming here religiously for the past 3 years.
I love the food, but they have been getting saucier and saucier every year to a point where they're losing the authentic southeast asian flavor. It is overpowered by sauces and covers up the true flavor that I used to enjoy.
However, it is still delicious.
Service has always been friendly and fast. 
Only drawback is it's cash only and they have no phone."}
{"text":"Recommended by a coworker, went to this rad place two weeks ago on a sat night. Great service, delicious lemongrass tea, and yummy apps & curry. I don't like noodles, but this place was good!!"}
{"text":"Pork Buns, Pork Buns, PORK BUNS!!!

The flavor in those thing's is unbelievable.  The atmosphere in this place, indescribable, the cost to eat here, more than affordable!

My good friend took me to lunch here for my birthday and I got the Crispy Chicken dish with noodles and that might of been the juiciest most flavorful chicken I had all of 2014 so far.  Oh yeah, The Pork Buns, don't even THINK about leaving this place if you don't order these.  Even if the thought of Pork Turns you off, these might Still hit the spot.

Another charming place with unique twists everywhere from the small menu to how they serve you water.  Look high class for a middle class price, my type of place!

Tell them HITTofMCM's sent ya!"}
{"text":"Gem of a place. It is hard to find a seat though during peak hours and it's usually a long wait. We ordered pick up. The food was awesome and very authentic. Not very pricy. One of the best asian food places in the Burgh."}
{"text":"Limited menu, but very good quality. Spice levels are a bit higher than most. It's all cash. Service was fair."}
{"text":"Went here on a random Wednesday for a quick and inexpensive dinner. I ordered the See Yew and my husband ordered the Kee Mao. I really enjoyed his sauce more so I would order that one next time. As long as you like Thai food you can't go wrong. They have a 0-5 spicy scale which is nice because I prefer a 0-1 while I know most people enjoy more heat. I recommend going low because they will bring more spice to your table if you request it. The serving size was large- I was able to make two meals out of it. I did feel it was a little lacking in veggies, I would've like to see more than 4 spears of broccoli with my dish. We will definitely be back on a night we want a delicious meal without spending a ton of money."}
{"text":"Have been to Noodlehead three times and have not been disappointed.  The food is great and I like the youthful vibe of the place.   Highly recommend and will return soon!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out here on a Monday night. For takeout, you need to go in and order in person. Luckily, the food comes out very fast so wait for takeout is under 10 minutes. Unfortunately, there was a slight mix-up with what I ordered, but the hostess quickly fixed the problem in a very professional and warm manner. I had the Chaing Mai Curry, which was super good, packed with flavor, and not too spicy (I do not like spicy food). My boyfriend had the Street Noodle #2 and also really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Huge portions and delicious food. My boyfriend who doesn't care for noodles really loved his noodle dish."}
{"text":"The food here is always good.  I'm impressed with the consistency.  Although the noodles are clearly the star, I love the \"snacks.\"  I could subsist solely on the pulled pork belly steam buns and pig wings. My only complaint is that Noodlehead is cash only."}
{"text":"When people ask me what restaurant is a MUST in Pittsburgh when they visit, I always recommend Noodlehead. It's been one of my favorite Thai restaurants since my freshman year. And it's pretty easy to get to by riding a 71B. 

The interior is pretty hip and the servers are always very welcoming. My go-to is usually the Pad See Yew or the Pad Kee Mao with spice level 3. I don't really know how well to describe their food because it's just that good. Not too greasy or sweet. Their pork belly steamed buns are a delicious addition as well! One order comes with two so it's perfect to share with another person. Another recent favorite has become the Street Noodle #1 dish. My first experience with it was that it was too sweet for my taste but I kept giving it another try and it's become another one of my go-to's. The Thai chicken that comes with that dish is tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. 

The only downside may be that it's cash only here but that doesn't stop me from coming :) 

Also! After dining here, most people head over next door to Millie's Homemade Icecream. But that's for another review"}
{"text":"Recently moved into the neighborhood and decided to finally give Noodlehead a try.  On entrance, I absolutely loved the atmosphere as it is very homey with its wooden tables/ decor and tons of plant life.  The waitress was very helpful in terms of indicating what could and could not be made gluten free.   If you have celiac disease, all appetizers along with two of the main dishes are a no go.  Also, again if you have celiac disease its probably best to avoid the tofu as it is not fried in a dedicated fryer.  However, once you get past that you realize that most of the noodle dishes can be made gluten free; indeed, they are more than happy to sub-in the rice noodle for lets say the egg noddle etc.  
Personally, for my first (hopefully of many) visit I kept it simple with the gluten free chicken pad thai, with a spice level of 1.  It was delicious, but make no mistake this place is serious about spice.  Though usually I am apt to get a 7/10 in other thai places and then add on hot sauce or sriracha without issue... Noodlehead's spice level 1 of 5 came close to making my eyes water. I kind of wish that the pad thai would have involved a few more veggies... but that's defs a personal preference.  Overall this place gets full marks for atmosphere and willingness to accommodate little gluten free me.
The only possible detractor from this restaurant is that it is indeed a cash only establishment, and if you want take out....well you will need to stop by as they have no phones.  That being said, worst case they have an atm in the back.  It is definitely worth a shot and I will definitely be back :D"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the best in Pittsburgh. I haven't had one thing here that I didn't love. No matter what, start with the Pork Belly Steamed Buns as an appetizer. They are seriously out of this world and perfect to split. As far as noodles, the Kee Mao with tofu (they have meat options, too, don't worry) was the first thing that I tried at Noodlehead. Even if you're not a big tofu fan, their's is cooked perfectly and goes well with the other ingredients in this dish really well. Highly recommended. For something a bit more saucy, my other two favorites are the Chiang Mai Curry and the Green Curry Linguine. Honestly, though, you can't go wrong at this place. 

A few important things: they don't take reservations and it can be packed around dinner time, alcohol is BYOB with a very small \"recycling\" fee, and it's cash only which is less of a big deal now that they have their own ATM. Service is not always the friendliest, but, given the price and style of the place, it's nothing to be bothered by.

Go to Noodlehead. Seriously, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Second time here and the food is amazing. Great service and great ambiance. I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Delicious pad thai at a very reasonable price! Generous portions, so you'll leave full with enough for the next day. Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great thai food in the area! Be aware that it is cash only though!"}
{"text":"Love love love everything on their menu--you could pick anything without being disappointed. Also I love the authentic spiciness. If you ask for hot you will get HOT. The only reason I can't give them five stars is bc every time I go they are super busy which makes it hard for staff to be attentive. A few times my order has been mixed up. But they are always quick to fix it! Overall great prices, great food, and a very hip atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delious, fast service, and inexpensive. Def plan to come back! There is also outdoor seating when weather is nice. Seating variety of bar stools, chairs and soft half booths. I had the sweet potatoe triangles, must try but good portion for no more than two or three to sample."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this restaurant hence why I've gone three times so far this month... I definitely recommend the pork belly steam buns! The staff was more than accommodating with my seafood allergy. The pad tai (without fish sauce) was amazing and full of flavor. You also get an enormous portion for the price. Awesome place with a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I went there with my five of my friends. The place has ambience to it. The menu is limited and that makes it easy to decide on what to eat. We ordered street noodles 1 and 2, pad Thai, dumplings and sweet potato triangles. They give 5 spice levels, I ordered 5 but didn't find it as spicy as they claim. Overall the food was ok, but it is not something you would regret if you do not go."}
{"text":"After years of walking by the restaurant, I finally took a date night with a friend here. And I am glad I did- I had a lovely night. Knowing that Noodlehead has a BYOB policy (with only a .50 cork fee), we brought a nice bottle of wine to celebrate friendship and Thai goodness. I ordered the See Yew noodles, which were very good. The portions were not too big, yet not too small. The inside of the restaurant (which I believe had been renovated within the last 5 years) was incredible, plus the service was great. Being Thai cuisine, the menu was very vegetarian friendly, so I would recommend this place even more so for vegetarians. I really enjoyed my experience here, so I will definitely stop in again soon!"}
{"text":"Great location and good food. 
Not too many options to choose from which was probably the only negative about the place - it is also right next to Millie's homemade ice cream store  which just makes it even more interesting ! 
CASH ONLY - so make sure you have some money on you"}
{"text":"I love this place! A friend originally told me about this place and it took me a few months to try it. I have been back three times since then! The vibe is cool and open. You can sit down or order take out. I usually get the Street Noodle #2 or See Yew with shrimp both at spice levels of 2. You can bring your own drinks but they will charge you fifty cents for a recycling fee. Also, Noodlehead is cash only but that doesn't stop people from eating here. The soup is excellent. I'm determined to try the entire menu, because I am convinced that everything on the menu is delicious. They are very busy on evenings and weekends so get there early!"}
{"text":"Great food.
Friendly staff.
And my three year old son loved it! 

We had the pork belly steamed buns, spring rolls and street noodles number 1. All delicious!"}
{"text":"It's always a good day when one gets to go to noodlehead.....one of my favorite restaurants that I've found since coming to Pittsburgh for college. 

Noodle head serves Thai noodles all for $9.50 each as well as two options for $6.50. I always get the street noodle #1 when I come here with the Thai fried chicken and leave so satisfied. The crunch on that fried chicken is what really sets it apart from fried chicken that I've had before. I've also tried the green Thai curry linguine which I probably wouldn't order again to be honest as well as the beef noodle which I loved!! My friends have gotten the Kee Mao (similar to Drunken noodles) which is also very good. 

I love the rustic low lit ambiance and the servers have always been so kind every time I've come. Sitting is limited and there's almost always a wait on the weekends during lunch or dinner time but I've never had a problem with waiting. Millie's is right next door and the perfect place to stop by afterwards to cleanse your palate which is what I usually do every time I come here. Perfect place to bring a friend who is visiting Pittsburgh for the first time! TIP THIS PLACE ACCEPTS CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"This is a place I have frequented since the day they opened. Even when I moved to Texas, I made the effort when I come home to stop by for the Sukothai. That's typically what I order. From time to time I get the Street noodle #2 but I'm pretty consistent in what I order. Today I went with the Street Noodle #2 and was disappointed by the freshness and by the service. The last time I came it was strictly the service that was poor and the hostess was very rude and so I left but because I've been coming since it's inception, I wasn't going to let that experience deter me. This experience has and I don't foresee myself returning to Noodlehead anytime soon if ever. 

My food wasn't hot, the flavor seemed a bit bland and my shrimp were very greasy as if they had been sitting. I ate it because I was hungry and in need of nourishment. The shrimp were not as plentiful as before so I ordered a second serving of the tempura shrimp. They came and they didn't even attempt to heat them up. They were lukewarm at best and grease oozing out when you press on them. I got the waitresses attention and I asked the waitress for two things: for a fresh and hot order of tempura shrimp. Without a word, no apology, just silence, she grabbed the plate and walked away. Came back a few minutes later, placed them on the table and asked was this better? In my head I'm thinking I don't know I haven't tasted them but I replied yes and said thank you and she walked away. Her demeanor was one that seem irritated and put on for having to do her job. I ate two shrimp my mother ate two shrimp and we took the rest to go. Left her a tip and said goodbye. 

I understand that it was slow but that's no excuse for poor service and cold food."}
{"text":"fun and vibey place for a dinner with friends or a quick meal before going out! the service was great and the food came out quick. very good portion size for the price of the plate. not many options on the menu (which means it's a quality place)! definitely going to taste every item on the menu. would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Just got home from dinner at Noodlehead, and can't wait to go back! The Pig Wings are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"A friend brought me here- it was a first for both if us, and I was pleasantly surprised. Yeah, the service wasn't amazing, but you are paying under 10$ for absolutely delicious Thai food. We couldn't stop ourselves from finishing our (sizable) portions! And the atmosphere is fun and seems like an interesting mix of ppl."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is one of my favorite restaurants in all of Pittsburgh. I live close to it so it makes it easy to get to, but the food is always quick and amazing. I wish they had takeout or delivery because I would get food from there way more often then the 2 or 3 days a week I already go in.  It's a great atmosphere and great food so it can't really be beat."}
{"text":"Noodle head is a great place for chatting with friends. The menu is pretty average, but my biggest complaint is the cash only policy. It's a huge inconvenience for most people who prefer to use credit cards for ease of use and security. I've enjoyed the few times I went in he past, but we try to choose somewhere else that doesn't require a separate trip to an ATM. Get with the times."}
{"text":"My date and I decided to venture to noodlehead last night. We arrived around 7:10 and waited about 25 minutes before we were seated. This wasn't bad for a week night. 

Once we were seated, the waiter promptly came over to open our wine and take our order. He was friendly; however it was very loud inside the establishment so I had a difficult time hearing what he was asking/saying to us. 

We ordered two appetizers. The spring rolls and the steam buns. I only had a spring roll and it was delicious. Crispy on the outside and flavorful on the inside. Our main entrees arrived shortly after our appetizers. I had the beef soup with a spicy level of 3. This is comparable to Nicky's spice level of 6 or 7 (if anyone was wondering). The beef was soft and melted in my mouth. The broth was packed full of flavor. The noodles were thin and easy to pick up with the chop sticks. 

Overall, I loved the food. The only reason I'm not giving noodlehead five stars is because it was so loud inside and I had to struggle to hear my date and the waiter at times."}
{"text":"Wow. Never again. I asked for chicken on the side because I intended to share my food with my vegetarian girlfriend. The waitress told me no. When I asked why she said it's \"because It's just inconvenient.\" The audacity this girl had is incredible. She continued to give us an attitude as we sat there with our jaws dropped from her absolute lack of fucks given for her job."}
{"text":"Simple menu, server was pleasant. Food is awesome, fast and delicious!  Highly recommend this place, especially if you're hungry hungry now!"}
{"text":"Solid. Good place for noodles. Cool vibe. Simple and straightforward menu. What's there not to love?"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience here! The prices were great for the large portions and the food was delicious. I would recommend the Pad Thai with chicken. It was cooked perfectly and for someone who doesn't like too much spice the 2 was just what I wanted."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Spring rolls, dumplings, and flat noodles with shrimp were delicious. Choose your spice level, 0-5. I had level 2 and it was the perfect amount of kick. For 50 cents per person you can BYOB. Prices are reasonable and there is plenty of seating, but I'd imagine this place gets packed on the weekends. 

Tips: this place is cash only, so stop at the ATM, bring along whatever alcohol it is you like to drink, split some appetizers with the table and then order yourself some noodles. if you're cautious about the spice level start low around 0-1. if it's your first time checking it out go during the week so you can avoid long waits."}
{"text":"In a nutshell: Hip, modern and affordable. Small menu of some appetizers and Thai noodles. Cash only. 

I really enjoyed Noodlehead. You can tell the quality of food when the place is packed and there are packs of people standing at the door waiting for a table. My husband and I came here on a Friday night and it looked incredibly busy, but the wait was only 15 minutes. We ordered the Sweet Potato Triangles for our appetizer, he ordered the Kee Mao and I ordered the Street Noodle #1. The sweet potato triangles were mashed sweet potato, wrapped in spring roll wrapper and deep fried, served alongside a light cucumber sauce. These were AMAZING. They were sweet, crunchy and when paired with the sauce, OMG. The refreshing cucumber cuts through the heaviness of the deep fried shell. The Kee Mao was delicious, but really spicy. My husband ordered spice level 1 and it was too spicy for the both of us. I also want to note that we are not sensitive to spice, as I typically order a 6 at other Thai places when I'm in the mood for mild spice. I ordered a 2 spice level for my street noodle #1 and it was perfect. The sauce was a sweet and spicy sauce. It's similar to Pad Thai, yet completely different. The noodles were very saucy, but it was perfect to dip the chicken in. 

I would give Noodlehead 4.5 stars. I loved everything about this place except for the over spice on my husband's Kee Mao, despite its low spice level. Maybe it was a mix up in the kitchen so I'm definitely willing to go back to give it another try."}
{"text":"So I went here for take-out a couple weeks ago and I must say I really couldn't tell you what all the fuss is about when it comes to this place. I want to say upfront that the food here is by no means bad in any way, shape, or form, but its just so generic. I got the Street Noodle (I think) #1 with a side of spring rolls at spice level 4 and it really just tasted like a standard fast-food Chinese joint, albeit with more spice because they were supposed to be Thai food. Now with that said the food is pretty cheap which is probably due to the fact that its a cash only business, so it seems more like a get what you pay for type of thing rather than a rip-off or waste of money. That being said, I can't really recommend this place, nor can I say to stay away, its just kind of, well, there."}
{"text":"I had the street noodles #2 with a spice level of 2. They were delicious. Long line but worth the wait, but we felt like we were packed like sardines. I wish the restaurant had more lighting; the lighting was very low and it was hard to see my roommate sitting across from me. Would not recommend for date night, but would recommend for a group of 2-4 people."}
{"text":"Great food for a good price! I love that its BYOB. Servers could be a bit more friendly but i love the food so, it is what it is! Great location, and very trendy inside. I will definitely be back. It is cash only so prepare for that! Pad see ew shrimp and pork steam buns were AWESOME!"}
{"text":"The food was so good. If you are looking for something spicy and tasty. Here is your best choice."}
{"text":"Very rude and unfriendly hostess staff. Waited an hour to be seated so we could be skipped over for some people who decided to leave and come back. Appetizer spring rolls came out cold. Ordered a 1 on the spicy scale and the food came out too hot to even enjoy, very painful to try to eat and when served a new dish it was very bland and tasted like oil. I WILL NEVER eat here again. The wait times for the quality of food are outrageous and to be treated like anything but a priority."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is tied for my favorite Thai in Pittsburgh along with Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park and Nicky's Thai Kitchen downtown. Though they have a short menu, they offer interesting and tasty dishes and I have never come with companions who did not thoroughly enjoy what they ordered. The one major drawback to this place is their \"hipster\" practices of not having a telephone and only taking cash. There is an ATM in the back of the restaurant in case you forgot cash but the wait can be very long and if you want takeout, you have to go to the restaurant to order and then sit and wait for it. This is one of only a few places I know of in Pittsburgh that is BYOB and it is the most reasonable one I have ever seen, with a 50 cents recycling fee per person (regardless of how much and what type of drinks you have). The service is not always the best because it is usually very crowded and the waiters and waitresses are running all over the place, but the food comes out quickly and is absolutely delicious. I wouldn't recommend the fresh rolls, which aren't very flavorful, but I love the pad kee mao and the green curry linguine. Note that the Noodlehead spice scale ranges from 1 to 5, so read their descriptions for each number rather than going with your usual spiciness number from a 1 to 10 scale. The prices are wonderfully reasonable and with the food as good as it is, some of my co-workers and I have a standing dinner at Noodlehead weekly! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Noodlehead is definitely one of the nicer places to go in the East End for a good meal under $20. Appetizers aside, the menu consists of tasty thai-styled noodles with your choice of chicken, beef, shrimp, or tofu (from mild to very spicy).  Basically, it's like a slightly edgier Thai version of PF Chang's (e.g., the shrimp are breaded and fried). I had the Street noodles #1 with shrimp and pork buns as an appetizer, which were not totally authentic, but delicious. There are a few non-alcoholic drinks, but it's BYOB. 

The atmosphere is warm and visually interesting, good for a causal dinner with friends or a date. I hope that this place makes it. It's a great addition to the Highland Ave/Penn Circle set of restaurants."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY! 

For college students, Noodlehead is out of the way and is cash only, but the pain is worth it. Noodlehead is one of the best, if not the best, restaurant in Pittsburgh. 

They're inconsistent sometimes with their spice scales.



Things I vouch for:
-pulled pork belly buns
-kee mao
-chiang mai curry"}
{"text":"The food here gets five stars--I had the street noodles with Thai fried chicken, and it was delicious. I am subtracting one star for slightly slow service, and the fact that the whole establishment is cash-only, which can create some problems among potential patrons."}
{"text":"This place is certainly hyped and it's good but is it 5 stars!? 

Okay... this is Pittsburgh. 

You don't have a phone? I seriously can't place a pickup order? I have to come in to place a pickup order then wait for it?

Additionally they won't seat you until your whole party is there. Not typical practice but fair enough. This isn't factoring into my review, just a heads up. 

That being said. The food is good. The menu is limited, maybe 10-15 entrees. Only one curry. The best pad Thai I think I've had in the city and the curry is amazing. 

The spice level ranges from 0-5 and beware things get spicy quickly. 

The atmosphere is nice and the service is always good. 

Cash only!!!"}
{"text":"Decent Pad Thai. Not my favorite, but if someone else wanted to go here, I wouldn't hesitate. Cash only."}
{"text":"One of my Thai staples in pgh. Small menu, but solves all Thai cravings. Service is fast, portions are good, food is delish. Make sure to get the pork buns! I have yet to try anything I didn't like on the menu yet!

Only cons are parking and cash only :("}
{"text":"Anyone who loves Thai Food needs to try this place. I tried their Chiang Mai Curry and it was delicious. It was the perfect consistency, spiciness and size. A GREAT bargain for the amount of delicious food you receive. It's clearly a very busy place based of the number of people waiting to be seated. But even then, the wait time was only fifteen minutes on a Friday night. Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, the wait staff is kind and very helpful with my food allergy and the Noodle Street #2 is amazingly tasty. The only poor post to this experience was the Beef Broth meal. The Beef was overcooked and the broth not very enjoyable. If stay away from this option to have a fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"One of the best places I have had Thai food at. Very good flavor, good price, and good ambience. What more do you need? Please note though that this is a cash only establishment and there is an ATM inside if you forget to bring cash with you."}
{"text":"My friend took me to this place and I really loved it! Everything was delicious, the fried chicken Crispy and fresh! They good for party though, Lol !"}
{"text":"Best noodles I've had in a lot of places, hands down. Highly recommend street noodle 2, Chaing Mai curry and pork buns. The food is flavorful, rich and satisfying. Was my favorite take out spot in Pittsburgh. Only thing I would change is the lack of a phone! Makes take away always take 5-10 mins but luckily they're pretty quick with the preparation. One of the very few things I'll miss about Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"18% mandatory Gratuity for a party of 5 was a shocker; it would be great if they had it printed somewhere (menu, website, etc like the 'cash only' payment option.) IMO, I like to tip more but I find it very rude and annoying when it's automatically added on the bill. 

The food quality is average, location and price is good but the long wait and rude wait staff experience is not worth it. I have been here 3 times and the quality keeps decreasing."}
{"text":"Great experience. Very friendly staff and they were very knowledgeable and helpful to those of us with food allergies. Was great! Definitely get the pulled pork steam buns. I would easily be a regular there if I was local. Also, come prepared as this is a cash only restaurant. But there is an atm there!"}
{"text":"took my parents here, and we all enjoyed ourselves!! the love boat and shrimp pad thai we're our orders - damn good! be aware of how much spice you request - my dad and i ordered the same meal w/ the same amount of heat, and heat it did have!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place, have been here many times both dine-in and carry-out.  The pork belly sliders are amazing, and all of the noodles are great too.   I love the curry.  It is a limited menu, but I have never been disappointed.

To address a few nuiances of this place:
1.  BYOB is 50 cents per person.  Love this aspect (other places in Shadyside also do this).
2.  Cash only.  Yes, it's 2014 and yes, you can get credit card charging apps.  That's not the issue.  This is a small, local place that does not wish to pay the fee every time a credit card is used, simple as that.  One way for them to reduce costs.  They have an ATM...so you can pay the ATM fee if you don't have cash lol.
3.  The host is a kind gentleman who is always working and does a great job.  My husband and I come in almost once weekly for carry-out, and he never misses a beat.  I know what a previous poster means about a little off, maybe he's on the spectrum?  Regardless, he is efficient at his job and always pleasant.
4.  Spice level - seriously spicy folks!  I'm a middle of the road kind of person, and I can only do a 2/5 on a good day when I want some serious spice.  It is amusing to watch a newbie go on to his (usually it's a douchey college guy) friends about how he loves spice yada yada, and then is unable to finish his meal.  I have witnessed this 3 times since the fall, always makes me chuckle."}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely delicious! We tried fresh rolls, crispy rolls, pork steam buns, pad Thai, see yew, Chiangmai curry. All were very fresh and tasty. The service was fantastic, and the atmosphere was cool."}
{"text":"I love the interior design of this place. The food was also great but service was even better. All around, great place. I don't know if I can say it's the best Thai food in Pittsburgh, but definitely would come back and recommend this place to people."}
{"text":"Ok so I am torn about how to rate Noodlehead, because, it was good, but it did not live up to the hype, so I was disappointed. I got the Chiang Mai Curry and I would classify it as a little below Nikky's Thai level... Which is still really good, but I was expecting way better than Nicky's from all the hype. Additionally, I asked for the hottest that they had, and it wasn't that spicy :( I guess all in all, this place is a no go for me. It is good, but not good enough to warrant having to park in shadyside, have cash on hand (cash only), and not get spicy enough food....and the ATM charged me the fee twice..boo"}
{"text":"The best place in Shadyside (and honestly, most of Pittsburgh) for Thai food. The service is fast and friendly, and the food is even better. The options are somewhat limited, but regardless of what you get, you will be satisfied.The spring rolls and pad Thai keep me coming back for more - the price to portion ratio is perfect. I often find myself bringing half of it back for lunch the next day! The only drawbacks are that it is cash only (with an ATM conveniently located in the back) and they do not take reservations. Whenever my friends come into town, Noodlehead is my go-to."}
{"text":"Love the noodles here. I always get the spiciest option. And it's BYOB which is also a plus. The interior is very beautiful, and the noise level was not bad, even though it was very crowded. Their service was quick but we did not feel rushed. I would definitely return"}
{"text":"pretty authentic noodle place, love the vibe."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Fun. Filling. Affordable. 

Three things that exist nowhere else in Shadyside.

Also, Harris food sucks."}
{"text":"Cash only! ATM within restaurant, hidden in the back near the restrooms.
I guess this place is popular with the younger population in Pittsburgh. The noodles were good and reasonably priced. When they say spicy, they mean it. I got a level 4 and that was spicy! Endless amount of water served from glass jugs already provided on the table. Good Thai food, will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went to order carry out and had super quick service. The food was absolutely delicious and they give you so much that I have leftovers for tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Wow! Noodlehead is absolutely amazing. I can't say it's completely authentic, but whatever they're doing in the kitchen seems to be working. The atmosphere was a bit grungy, but kind of charming in its own way. Service was friendly and efficient. Food came out in a timely manner. All the dishes that I tried were on point. Prices are very reasonable, everything under $9. 

The pork belly buns were just divine with the combination of savory, sweet, tangy, fluffy and crunch. Definitely a must try! I also really enjoyed the street noodle #1 (with crispy chicken tempura and slightly vinegary sauce), chiang mai curry (which was rich and creamy), and the kee mao (flat rice noodles in a sweet, tangy basil sauce). 

I highly recommend Noodlehead! They have a small menu, but it's very well put together. Two things to keep in mind though: CASH ONLY, and beware of their spice level. It's on a scale of 1-5, but their spicy might be spicier than you think (dun dun dunnnnnn...!)"}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place. The food is fantastic and the portions are generous. When they say its spicy they mean it. Perfect!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. I always order the see yew and add chicken. You choose the level of spice, but beware! I can handle spicy food but not too spicy and a level 1 spice was hot to me. Now I just get level zero so I don't go through 2 gallons of water during my meal. The steamed pork buns are the best appetizer. Be sure you have cash because it's cash only! Its also BYOB."}
{"text":"Good price, good food. Have to admit, used to be better. They had a supplier change at one point I believe and after that I couldn't find my first experience"}
{"text":"My hubster and I have been on the search for the sub $15 meal, and we have found it at Noodlehead! We like the new decor, and the friendly service. Best of all are the (relatively) lost cost, but delicious noodle dishes. Yes, they might be more than what you would pay at a divey place in Oakland, but here, you are paying for ambiance and the convenience of Shadyside.

Veggie options are limited to the three $9 specials. However, they will also do the Chiang Mai noodles with tofu, so keep that in mind. The hubster had the Pad See Ew, which he said was very good, and I really enjoyed the Chiang Mai noodles. Not too spicy or peanuty. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One line: Cheap good noodles $6 or $9!

So why not go.
The decor is ridiculously hipster for a cheap asian restaurant (I still love my cheap asian spots with no frills) but in a good way! Wooden panels on the wall with greenery throughout. I feel lk kids needing a cheap date spot could come here and still impress the girl  I did see a whole lot of very fashionable high schoolers or college kids in there. No person over lk...40 seemed to be there  

And food was great! Usually whenever I order shrimp anything in an asian restaurant, they don't give me but here they did not hold back! I got #2 with shrimp tempura. The batter was light and crunchy. The shrimps were fat. And good shrimp-to-noodle ratio. Got the spice level to be a 2, and it had a decent sparks of spice even for an asian who likes spicy food. But next time I'd go for 3 or 4. 

One caveat is that it's cash only."}
{"text":"So, so good.  We only got take-out once, but I picked up a smorgasbord of appetizers and noodles.  We will definitely be back.  Highly recommend, but bring cash."}
{"text":"Never disappoints! So far I have had Street Noodle 1, Pad See Ew, Chiang Mai Curry--all of which with chicken--and they're all phenomenal each time. Quick service, BYOB, great experience. Only things are to remember to bring cash as it is cash only, and they do not take reservations, so plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"Spices, quality of meal, appetizers, variety of menu, and portion sizes make This a solid Thai option. The atmosphere, location, and byob make it an attractive date night option as well. If you haven't tried it yet, get there as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant a while ago. I found the setting to be really comfy and fun. I shared a few dishes with my partner. We ordered a few noodle dishes, which were delicious, but not something I can remember a few months later. The pork belly buns were a little different than others I had tried. Overall, it was a really nice environment in a trendy area."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Noodlehead on a Thursday night, the wait was only about 10 minutes.  I ordered the Chiang Mai Curry, heat level 4.  I can tolerate a lot of heat, and level 4 was pretty spicy but I felt it was not spicy enough, so I will try 5 next time.  The noodles were well cooked and the chicken was very tender.  

over all great experience, it was a bit hot inside, to the point where we were sweating."}
{"text":"Great food! Fun atmosphere and no corking fee.  Be careful when ordering your spice level.  We ordered our entrees at level 2 and 3 and it was very hot!  Tasty but spicy :)"}
{"text":"Fast cheap and yummy. They take cash only but boy is it a minor inconvenience. The food was amazing. The starter of pork belly steam buns are so good and I could just sit and eat them all day. I got the Thai street noodles 2 with a spice of 2 out of 5 and it was spicy and just so good. Be careful what you pick with the 1 to 5 spice rankings. I had a 2 and my mouth was burning. 1 was a good tingle. So I would say a 5 is just a full on fire in your mouth. I can't wait to go back to this place and tray another item on the menu."}
{"text":"We had a Pad Thai and some spring rolls. The noodles were very good, rolls were regular, not special at all. The restaurant itself is very cozy. Service was a little bit confusing for a not very crowded day. Good house-brewed lemongrass iced tea."}
{"text":"Great tasting food and awesome service. I went around 5pm on a Sunday with 3 other people and had a 30 minute wait. But, the wait was definitely worth it. I got the green curry linguine and the base sauce is slightlyyyy spicy but mostly sweet. The noodles could've been cooked slightly more but overall it was a great flavor. I also got the lemongrass honey ice tea which was very refreshing. We also got the steam buns and Thai fried chicken as appetizers which were both delicious. Pretty much everything on their menu is great!"}
{"text":"Love love love noodle head ! Pad Thai was so good we add tempura shrimp it's so good ! Chiangmai curry is so good ! I never had a bad meal ever, even on a busy day the wait is never too bad , just expected"}
{"text":"I'm someone who likes to try different items on the menu when I go to restaurants but Noodlehead is the exception. I absolutely adore their Chang Mai Curry noodles and whole family loves the Steamed Buns! The kids like the Street Noodles #1 and my husband likes their PadThai. Even though we each have our favorites everything is fantastic. BYOB also means your bill is never outrageous which is always nice."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai in all of Pittsburgh! For a place with no phone and no card abilities it's always hopping. They get you in and out fast, too."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place at Pittsburgh! The place is always packed and there are no reservations so be sure to arrive 15-20 min. Before you want to be seated. 

The pad thai is our favorite dish by far. Street noodles 1 & 2 are also good. And we tried the pulled pork buns and they are good too (a little sweet) 

You can always order the spice on the side if you are not sure about the spice level. (It is spicy)

Prices are very affordable just make sure you bring cash, because they don't take credit cards.

BYOB"}
{"text":"Finally tried Noodlehead on a weekend night. It's always packed so my husband and I opted for takeout. Unfortunately, they do not take orders in advance because they don't have a phone - you have to place your order in person - so, we had to stand around waiting on the sidewalk for quite a while. I had the Green Curry Linguine and my husband had the Steamed Pork Dumplings and Street Noodle 1. The flavors were great. Beware of the spice levels! Usually when I order spicy food it's not as hot as I would have liked, so we ordered the hottest level (5) and it was a bit too much for me. I would give Noodlehead 4 stars in terms of food but a 3 overall, due to the lack of convenience. I would go back, but they seriously need to get a phone and start accepting credit cards."}
{"text":"Great food. I stay with spicy level 3 because I am a baby. I love the chicken street noodles. Be prepared to pay cash and if you dont get there right when it opens, be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"4.6/5

What a nice Thai noodle spot! Noodlehead offers a rather simple menu but a really good one, focusing only on Thai noodle dishes! 
Here are a few dishes that I get to enjoy 
1. the Sukuthai has a really balanced flavor and sourness. Meatballs in there are delicious and juicy! 
2. The Honey lemongrass iced tea is okay. A little bit bland but it sure does cool you down instantly from all the heat

3. This Pad See Yew with tofu might be my favorite pad see yew I've had for awhile! 

Ps: if you can take the heat, get a least level 4,5 crazy spicy to really get the . 


Overall I'd say this is a must visit restaurant if you are in Pittsburgh and if you love Thai food!"}
{"text":"Oh, I think I like it!

I convinced my friends to come here for my halfsies (my half-birthday.  Yes I celebrate it, don't hate).  Noodles and BYOB?  Didn't take much coercion.  

If you do not like spicy food, this might not work for you.  I typically go for the 4-5 on the 10 point Thai food spice scale.  Noodlehead uses a 1-5 point scale.  The one here, is a 5 elsewhere, according to my tastebuds.  Thank goodness the waiter explained all of this or else who knows what would have happened!

Noodlehead boasts a very simple menu.  We ordered pork belly steamed buns, Thai fried chicken, Pad Thai,and Chiang Mai Curry-- all were amazing!

Know before you go: there is community seating (I'm sure the group next to us hated our conversation), it's BYOB (didn't even notice the fee, it was so nominal) and it's CASH-only (there's an ATM across the streets so ain't no thang).

If you're wondering if you should go- I offer a supportive \"YES!\""}
{"text":"Oh how I dream about their pork belly steamed buns. Like seriously, I think that was the best thing I've eaten in Pittsburgh! I'm not from here and it's been a goal of mine to try as much cuisine as possible and this was the best! I hate the street noodles with fried chicken and let's be fair, after the perfect appetizer it wasn't as good. I still ate it and took some home, but I would probably go back to have those steamed buns!

Side note: The service was not very good, normally I don't like to downgrade a restaurant for their service, but our server wasn't nice at all. He wasn't friendly and didn't check on us once we had ordered. We didn't see him again until we had to track someone down for our check. That was disappointing and did take away from our experience. 

But.. WOOHOO Pork steamed buns!"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a very long time. Finally tried it for my birthday last weekend and I was blown away by two things: the food quality/taste and the speed/personal level of service. 

Had the street noodles #2 which features lightly fried shrimp in the most delicate lime and spice sauce. Truly THE BEST Thai noodles I have had in Pittsburgh. Also split an order of the fried sweet potato appetizer with the most delicious cucumber rice vinegar sauce for dipping. 

Super yummy food!! Give it a try. Not as crowded when we went on a Sunday after 2pm."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Thai restaurant! I always order the See Yew and have never been disappointed. It's a great place to grab a bottle of wine and catch up with some friends over great food!"}
{"text":"Very nice place with great food, reasonably priced and in reasonable quantity.
They had a variety of noodle options with different options of meat as well.
But the fact that they dont accept cards is an absolute bummer."}
{"text":"Revised - went again and had a different waiter (seemed to have some authority, so maybe the owner?) and he was so enthusiastic, bouncing around and making sure we were completely satisfied. 4 stars revised to 5! Same great noodles, and this time spot on service."}
{"text":"Very cool place with a nice, dark and cozy atmosphere. We went a bit early on a Saturday around 430 but my friend, who has gone many times, said it gets packed in the evening. I loved how fresh the broccoli was in my meal. We also got the pulled pork buns which are really hard to describe. My friend calls them \"little clouds\" because they're so soft. They were delicious, however you explain them!

My only complaint is that I ordered 0 on the spice scale because I'm a wimp. My friend got 1 but often gets a 2, she wasn't feeling too crazy. We both ordered the same meal but she also got hers with no egg and upon eating, we realized they got hers right with no egg but that they spiced ours opposite. She wanted more heat and I was definitely thinking mine tasted more spicy than I'd prefer. Small mistake but had she ordered a 2 like she usually does and had it been served to me, I probably wouldn't have been able to eat it."}
{"text":"I had mixed feelings about this place and because of that it took me a very long time to come here.

I'm really loving the atmosphere this place offers. I think this is a popular area and can be seen as a great place to meet up with friends to have dinner. It has an outdoors, Asian island vibe but indoors.

The menu is simple and affordable and the service is great. As far as the food, it has a very modern and American take on Thai cuisine. It's not authentic by any means, but does tend to cater to the American palate. 

I tried the street noodles #2 and #1. Cooked well, seasoned well. However, it had a lot of fish sauce and sweet chili sauce. I'm sure that's how the dish is suppose to taste. It was okay. Food presentation is excellent!

For appetizers: pork buns and fresh spring rolls! The pork buns were delicious. Buns were perfectly small, soft, and fluffy. Pork was a tad grease but that's okay! I loved it. The fresh spring roll lacked a lot of flavor. I couldn't really taste the freshness of the herbs. The dipping sauce made up for it.

I'll come back, maybe to try another noodle dish?? There are better authentic Thai restaurants around the city, why would I? Noodlehead is a great place for entertaining friends or family, offers great ambiance/service, and even great for a date night. Don't forget to bring cash with you, it's cash only."}
{"text":"What to get: street noodles, pork buns
Service: 4/5
Atmosphere: casual, sit down, trendy
Wait: 0 mins (Monday 1PM for 1) 
Parking: street

The Experience: [August 2016]
Drove from out of town and headed straight to Noodlehead for lunch. If you're not familiar with the area, you may be circling the area for parking on a week day, but it's worth it. This place is CASH ONLY, so don't forget to grab a few bills before coming in. Not sure why I would label this trendy, but it does embody that kind of place once you step inside.

Since I came on my own, seating was a breeze. I sat at the window at the tall seats on a shared thin table. Kind of funny to be chowing down while people walk staring at you. Pay them no mind as you stuff your face since the food is wonderfully flavored.

I got the street noodles #2 and steamed pork buns. There's 2 buns per order and they go pretty quick as an appetizer. Nice way to start the meal. Then you're greeted with a steaming hot bowl of fresh noodles topped with fresh tempura shrimp and bok choy. The noodles are plentiful and it seemed never ending after awhile. I vaguely remember getting a little bit of spice in my noodles and my nose started running by the middle of the meal (a good sign). Just be sure to keep getting your water refilled, but the spice level is on point here.

If I lived in town, this would be one of my go-to comfort foods. Glad I found this gem while out traveling."}
{"text":"Love this place. Everything I've had here is delicious! Friendly and fast service. Nice decor and atmosphere. Best noodle place in town. In my opinion better than the noodle places in Sq Hill. I wish they would accept Square payment though. Cash is something I don't like to carry. That is my only complaint."}
{"text":"I get to take my wife out for a relaxed outdoor lunch, eat delicious food, and not break the bank? Yeah, I'm in.

Noodlehead seemed rather quiet while my wife and I were there, and I can't for the life of me fathom why. The staff took a few moments to come wait on us, but once we had their attention they were friendly, helpful, and very familiar with the menu. 

The Pork Belly Dumplings were delicious, although with just two dumplings per order, they left us wishing for more. (I believe my exact words were \"I want that. Again. Now.\") 

We had the Kee Mao, and the Pad Thai for our entrees. The Kee Mao we requested extra spicy, and while not nuclear, it certainly had a delicious kick to it. I've had a lot of Pad Thai in Pittsburgh, and the quality has varies greatly between venues, so I was trepidatious about ordering it. I needn't have worried, the light and fresh flavors of their Pad Thai were refreshing, and I highly recommend it be eaten on a nice day, in their outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I just moved to Pittsburgh from Boston, and am on a mission to find really great Asian places. With parents from Vietnam, good Southeast Asian food is a must. Noodlehead has cool decor and a fantastic vibe. More importantly, the flavor combinations are dead-on authentic. Not overly sweet or salty (as happens with places that rely on MSG). The noodle soups were rich, and the stir-frys (i.e. the Pad see yews, etc.) had a lot of what the Chinese call \"wok hei,\" or dragon's breath (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wok#Wok_hei)--a certain quality of food that has been cooked fast and well over extremely high heat. The menu is limited, but that means every dish is consistently cooked to perfection, and that the prices are kept low ($9 for everything on the menu except the sukothai and the love boat, which are $6 each). The adjustable spiciness level for every dish is also a huge plus. My mom, who is super picky about Asian food, loved Noodlehead so much that we came here twice while she was visiting me.

P.S. This place is BYOB"}
{"text":"Service is absolutely terrible and they do not let you sit down unless you entire party is there. We had a group of 7 with a 6th meeting us later in the evening and they would not allow us to sit.  We had to change our reservation to 6 and tell our friend he was shit out of luck. Food is good, but what the hell is that all about?"}
{"text":"It is a good place... but mostly crowded. good atmosphere, good food. Staff is good. I tried Pai Thai and Kee Mao."}
{"text":"Came here for an early summer dinner. With some of the other reviews indicating that the place usually gets busy for dinner service, I was surprised to walk in and see only a few other parties inside (and one party at one of the two outside tables).

Service was really fast and friendly from the moment I walked in the door. For $12 and change, I got their Street Noodle #1 and a glass of lemongrass and honey iced tea. For a quite warm afternoon, the tea is refreshing with just the right amount of honey to not overpower the delicate citrus taste from the lemongrass. Street Noodle #1 is rice noodles and baby boc choy in a chili, fish sauce, and cilantro sauce, all topped with a crispy thai fried chicken cutlet. The sauce was especially tasty and in true Thai cuisine, the spices didn't only contribute heat, but a significant amount of flavor. This time I only got it medium spiciness (level 2 on a scale of 0-5), but next time, I'll definitely go up a notch or two. Also what was surprising is that the sauce tasted like it contains palm sugar, a more richer sweetness than plain sugar. The Thai Fried Chicken was juicy, while preserving a light and crunchy battered crust. The chicken alone is something worth coming to this place for for, even with their stand-out noodles."}
{"text":"We expected better. 
The room is well decorated and trendy. Filled with lots of college age and slightly older diners. Service was non chalant, even with lots of people waiting and us being long done with our mediocre food they did not bring a check

The best dish was pulled porky bun. Good went down hill quickly from there. Dumpling were terrible I would not be surprised if they were frozen. None of the 4 of us liked or even came close to finishing our soup or see wah noodle dishes. It just wasn't tasty. 

I usually like Thai food but not this time."}
{"text":"As several other reviewers have already said, the menu is not extensive, but the staples are there and vegetarians are not forgotten.  The dining room is casual and cozy.  We were a little surprised that they did not have any hot beverages (coffee house is right next door if it's a cold day) or the standard soft drinks, but at the end of the day water is best for you, so maybe we should give them credit for keeping us away from all that caffeine.  We started with the garlic chicken wings and shared chicken pad thai and chiang mai curry.  We both like a little spice and ordered our entrees at 3 (1- no spice ; 5 - crazy hot) and both were prepared just right.  Quantities were more than adequate but not glutinous.  This is a really nice Thai experience that's worth a visit if you're roaming near Shadyside."}
{"text":"Great food. But a 1 star for a really uncomfortable environment. We were seated 10 mins after our reservation (our entire group showed up 3-5 mins after our reservation, they don't seat incomplete groups, which I think is normal). We are quick eaters and wanted to hang out to enjoy the BYOB feature - however the 3rd time the waitress visited our table she had a check, and subsequently asked if we needed change at each visit. Within 55 minutes we felt pressured to depart. Best of all this was a Monday at 6:35 pm - hardly peak time to push for huge table turnover.

If you show up, expect to stay for less than an hour!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, but kind of a regularly long wait. I recommend the sweet potato triangles"}
{"text":"I have been going here at least once a week for the past three years, and I can't tell you how much I love this place. From friendly staff, to their delicious pork buns, Chiang Mai Curries, and Green Curry Linguini, refreshing lemongrass tea, and affordable prices, this is the perfect local eatery. I don't find it annoying at all that it's cash only and in-person only, the latter emphasizes the importance of social dining. I've been trying to find a substitute in the city I am moving to, but so far to no avail. I wish I can take Noodlehead with me! Thanks for all the wonderful meals."}
{"text":"Great food. Reasonable prices. Heaping portions.

I was really happy with my see yew with tofu. This $9 dish easily fed me for two meals. My friend was equally impressed with her curry. I also liked that you can customize the spice level of your meal. I thought the level 3 was pretty spicy, so I can't imagine what level 5 (the highest) tastes like. The restaurant is also BYOB + 50 cent charge per person!

Now, let me get to why this restaurant is worthy of 4 stars, but not 5. The decor is really cute. I love the candles and all of the wood details. However, a flimsy stool made of wire is not a comfortable place to sit and have a meal. I get they are going for a hipster vibe and have mismatching seats at the their tables. But they at least need to be comfortable. My weird stool was too low and made my butt hurt. Get some new chairs.

Also, get a phone. If you want to carry out, you have to stand in the vestibule and wait for your food instead of calling ahead for a fast pick-up.I understand it's your decision not to take reservations, which is fine. I understand it's your decision to not take credit cards, which I can live with. But you're a restaurant and you need a phone."}
{"text":"While looking for some Asian food in the area Noodlehead came up as a top Yelp result. Maybe being from California has given me some unrealistically high standards for Asian food outside the state, but I thought this place was alright. It seems like a pretty popular restaurant so we did have to wait a bit before getting seated, and it's CASH ONLY. 

Service was meh. I ordered Street Noodles #2 (egg noodles and tempura shrimp). Everything tasted fresh and I liked that they didn't completely drown their noodles in soup/sauce. I recommend ordering with the spice on the side, as it's pretty spicy. The spice powder has a great flavor in itself, so it's nice to be able to sprinkle in on at your own discretion. The shrimp was delicious, and they were pretty generous with the amount of shrimp, but the meal itself was pretty small. If I was hungrier I definitely could've finished the whole thing (which is saying a lot because I almost never finish my restaurant meals). There weren't very many sprouts or bok choy in the dish either. It was about 10 shrimps and a small portion of noodles for $12 (including tip), which isn't super worth it to me. 

Again, I'm not sure how the other eateries in the city are, but coming from California this place was okay."}
{"text":"Addicted to the pork buns and the Street noodle 1 with the crispy chicken with a spice level 1. I thought I could take heat until Noodle Head made me think again. They sure bring on the heat! Either way the food is so good. Try the street noodle 1 or the pad Thai. Cash only. And you can bring your own alcoholic beverage since they don't have a liquor license. Anyway good place to eat."}
{"text":"I have tried the japanese noodles, the noodles are fine, but the sauses are too much salty, and makes me thirsty."}
{"text":"Small menu but big taste. Been here a couple times and it's becoming my go to noodle place. Great staff, excellent service and affordable food. Plus their BYOB policy has no corkage fee!"}
{"text":"This isn't traditional Thai food. If you can keep that in mind, then I'm sure you'll have a good time at Noodlehead.
The food is, quite simply, delicious. I crave the warm spicy broth of Sukothai on cool winter nights, and Chiang Mai noodles are decadent but so worth it. The Pad Thai, although not the best I've had in Pittsburgh, is still pretty good. The one dish I've had no luck with is the Street Noodles made with tempura shrimp. The noodles were all clumped together, and although I ordered a spicy level of 2, it was so hot it was almost unpalatable. I love spicy food, but the highest I ever go is a 4 because this food is HOT. The ambiance is sophisticated yet laid back, and the service is usually quick, even when they're busy. The prices are amazing- for $9, I get a dish that can easily last me 2, if not 3, meals. 
If you're looking for delicious, warm, spicy, Thai noodles, then look no further. Noodlehead will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, and good value. Stand-outs for me are the pork buns (of course), Sukhothai, and Chiang Mai noodles."}
{"text":"Dang I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was based on such a small menu. Of everything we ordered, the best dishes were the pork buns, the chiang mai curry, and the kee mao. We literally ordered almost everything on the menu and the rest were just ok.

Highly recommend visiting. The staff was great, parking was easy, and I loved the ambiance.

BYOB and cash only."}
{"text":"Food was a five star loved it ..... Service on the other hand not so much ... Waitress not happy at all didn't greet us or Ask if we've been there before ... Which this was the first time ,,,, she came by twice once to order other time to bring check .... Didn't ask if we needed anything or how the food was .... So don't think we will be back or would order to take home .....cause you can't call ahead NO PHONE --- and wouldn't allow us to have separate checks and its CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"Tastiest noodles you can find in Pittsburgh, and for a very good price! I really hope they start local deliveries soon."}
{"text":"Food is good although I don't think it's authentic. Portion is very small. They write as if their food is extremeley spicy, but their spicy level is prety much the same as other \"American\" restaurant. Their discription says 4 is Thai hot, so I tried 4 but it was barely spicy and I ended up getting extra chili powder."}
{"text":"If you're a noodle and Thai enthusiast, you're going to love this place!! Their entr√©es are HUGE, super tasty, and only $9! On top of that, there's only a 50 cent recycling fee for BYOB and no corkage fee!

Some of mine and my friends' favorites include their Thai fried chicken and pork belly buns for apps, and their Pad Thai, Chang Mai, Street Noodle #1, and See Ew for entr√©es. However, they've pretty much perfected their menu, so I'm sure you'll be satisfied with any dish you get!

Something to be aware of is that they don't take reservations, and sometimes there can be a really long wait. But don't panic! There's a wine and spirits right down the street for you to pick up some wine for dinner, or a fantastic ice cream place called Millie's right next door. Take your pick!"}
{"text":"I went on a Thursday night and waited about 15 minutes to be seated-- so worth the wait! We had veggie spring rolls and the \"Street Noodle 2,\" both of which were very good. The noodle dish was just the right amount of spicy. Quick and friendly service, nice atmosphere. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Likely my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. 
The food is consistent and delicious. I'm not a fan of spicy food so there are a number of items I haven't tried. 
The food is unique enough that if you eat the same thing every single time and you go there once a week for four months, you'll still want to go back. 

Cash only!"}
{"text":"YUMMYUMMM IN MY TUMTUMMMM. 

The egg rolls and buns for appetizers were amazing (both only came with 2 so good for a party of 2 haha), but this review is mainly for the kee mao with level 1 spice. 1 is bearable, but the heat does build over time! It was the perfect kick, but if you're on the fence, do no spice hahaha. The noodles were cooked so well and the flavor was banging. I got the shrimp for my meat, but my friends both got chicken... The chicken was soooo good. 

Service was on point as well. The place was busy but our waitress (platinum blond hair and bomb af winged liner) was so attentive!

Gotta come back next time i'm in the burgh.

PS CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"I went to Noodlehead with 4 friends on a Saturday night. We got there around 7pm, the wait was half an hour. It was crazy packed. The food smelled so good, so I was willing to wait. 

We were seated (your entire party needs to be there) at one of the larger tables. It's BYOB and all of my girls had some wine. Noodlehead provided wine glasses. All of us had screw off bottles so, we didn't need anything opened for us. There's no cork fee, just a 50 cent recycling fee. That's pretty awesome and environmentally friendly. 

Our waitress came to the table immediately to help us out. I ordered pad Thai, at spice level two. They ask you your spice level from 1-5. If you like spicy stuff, a 2 is pretty spicy. My friend ordered something that was a 3, and was crying at the table. You can also get a 0 spice level. Just be aware that you want to taste your food. 

I also got the veggie egg rolls. An order comes with two of them. They have a sauce on the side that's really sweet.  

Everything came out great and wonderful and quick. The portions were a great size and I really enjoyed how busy the restaurant was. It made you feel like you were in the right place on a Saturday night. Be sure to check it out. It's really inexpensive, and the food + service are just top notch."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is spectacular. Perfect, tasty noodle dishes for super low prices. Ambience is really nice too. Definitely get the pork buns!"}
{"text":"My go to restaurant in Pittsburgh.

Noodlehead has great, cheap Thai food. I've had almost everything on their menu, and they're all fantastic. My favorite is the Pad See Yew with chicken.

Don't underestimate Noodlehead's spice level. If it's your first time here, I would recommend getting a 2/5 spice max. I got a 4 once and I was legit crying. Thankfully, my waiter was kind enough to switch my dish for a complete new one at a lower spice level.

I always forget, but it is CASH ONLY. There are often long wait times, so I sometimes treat myself to dessert before dinner at Millie's Homemade Ice Cream right next door.

{"text":"I would rate this restaurant a 3.5 out of five considering how the only dish I tried was the chicken pad Thai. I must say the sauce was overpowering and the dish itself was not as dry as I would have liked it. The noodles were overcooked as I ate my dish using a spoon. I would have enjoyed more crushed peanuts as I believe that truly makes the pad Thai. The flavor was good, but the sauce was overwhelming as I went through the dish. I would love to give this restaurant another try along with all their other dishes considering its popularity."}
{"text":"So, Thai food is my jam if that makes sense at all. I've eaten at a lot of places in Pittsburgh, but Noodlehead takes the cake. The only downfall is that the menu is limited but they definitely make up for it with quality of awesomeness. The overall atmosphere reminds me of an old Chipotle, but it's simple and that's what I enjoyed the most. They're not confused with their brand trying to make it like a \"fancy, Chinese restaurant\". I always get the Pork Belly Steamed Buns (without cilantro because I think cilantro is made from Satan's feces) and chicken Pad Thai - medium spice. The portion size is generous so be prepared to eat too much or you know, just take some home. I've been there almost every weekend for the past month and honestly wish I could go everyday. Everyone there is super nice and actually enjoy working there so that's a definite plus. Make sure to have cash because well, it's cash only. There are a few ATM's within walking distance just in case you forget.

If you haven't gone already, go and eat enough for me, too."}
{"text":"I loooove me some Noodlehead. It's come to be a regular option for so many kinds of meals: a birthday dinner with coworkers, an impromptu gabfest with a girlfriend (in which we may or may not have scurried over in gym leggings and/or scrubs), a first (or fourth) date, or a catch-up with my brother (for whom Noodlehead was the ticket to him falling in love with Thai food!). The pad thai (my preference = with those perfect tiny shrimp!) is now an old standby, but Street Noodle #1 is an equally viable option. I've also been lusting after the Chiang Mai curry as of late. Don't forget a steamed pork bun or two to tide you over."}
{"text":"great food. watch out, though. getting close to their close time, they won't take anymore to-go orders (ie 10 min before close). Otherwise, great food"}
{"text":"Came here after a year in Pittsburgh.  Food was delicious, but quite spicy (medium was still a bit hot).  I had the Street Noodle #2 and my husband Sukhothai soup. Tempura shrimp on the Street Noodles were crisp and not greasy.   Both were delicious.  The pork buns are amazing, as was mentioned by many others."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Pittsburgh, IMO. The food is so good. My only  problem is that they don't accept cards. Only cash."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my new favorite restaurants in Shadyside! My boyfriend and I have probably been there a dozen times since it's opened and every time the food is consistent and delicious! The atmosphere is very relaxed and the prices are inexpensive so we go for lunch on the weekends often. Its also nice for a casual date with friends since it is BYOB! 

You can't go wrong with the classic Pad Thai dish, but our favorite is the See Ew!"}
{"text":"This might be the one place in Pittsburgh where the spicy level is totally accurate. Anywhere else, I just order basically the top number, knowing that they calm it down for me. But here, BEWARE. I was talked down to a 3/5, and glad to have been convinced!

The food here was amazing, very authentic, came out very quickly and I will absolutely be back. 

They get a point off for their annoying ego though - no reservations, no phone, can only be seated when whole party is there, price is high for the portion."}
{"text":"So tasty, so cute and reasonably priced. Taking off a star only because I wanted something with a little heat so I got a 2, and my dish had zero spice at all. While my boyfriend got a 1 and his was WAY spicier than mine. It still tasted good but it was missing the spice."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. The staff seemed genuinely happy, which always makes a restaurant's atmosphere nicer. Our server was friendly and sweet, and made a killer recommendation for me. Decorated well, smells nice, AND CHEAP. Omg so affordable. 

I had the street noodle #1, at a \"1\" spice level which was still a little too spicy for my sensitive palette. Lol"}
{"text":"***BYOB, CASH ONLY***

Good ambiance, good food, and GREAT prices. I had been counting down days to get to Pittsburgh to try Noodlehead and finally had a chance to try it last night. We got there around 7pm on a Thursday night and the restaurant was buzzing. There was a 20 minute wait outside and the entire restaurant was packed. 

The first thing you'll notice is that the restaurant is very hip - good lighting and nice decor on the inside, and it's fairly loud. The restaurant is also huge - especially compared to NY. I can only compare it to the size of The Smith... So, the restaurant being packed like this is a good sign. It's also cash only and BYOB, and there's a wine/liquor store 2 blocks from the restaurant. 

The menu is short and sweet. There are two types of noodles - one section has a no substitution rule, which I am 100% on board with. The other section are the popular noodles: pad kee mao, pad see ew, and pad thai. All entrees are $9. All entrees has a spice level you can choose, from 0-5. Trust the spices; these are true Thai spices. 5 is VERY spicy. You have been warned!!

We ordered the pork puns, and then pad kee mao (spice level 4 and 5), Chiang Mai curry (spice level 4), and pad see ew (spice level 3). The pork buns were a little disappointing, as they were made from pulled pork as opposed to a traditional pork belly. The entrees were all very good and very fresh. Good portions and good spice levels. 

The notable dish at Noodlehead was the Chiang Mai curry. It is simply amazing! The curry was so rich and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The flavors are all pronounced. I would definitely suggest getting the Chiang Mai curry.

If you're in Pitt, GO HERE! A plus is that the popular Millie's Homemade Icecream is right next door."}
{"text":"I love their noodles! Try the steam pork buns too! Bring a beer with you! Hmm sometimes he noodles are a little too sweet to me so I ask for no extra sugar/ sweet sauce. 
Be careful when you choose the spicy level. I tried all levels and decided to stay on level 3 forever. Level 5 was impossible. I almost died."}
{"text":"Decided on takeout tonight! Pad Thai and Street Noodle #2. Definitely did not disappoint. We both got 2/6 on the spice level and it's was still very spicy! Medium is actually more of a hot. Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Noodlehead perhaps 9 or 10 times now, and always really enjoyed my meal.  It's a cool space with excellent Thai food for under $10."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times, and I'm always impressed!! Remember it's BYOB and cash only! Also, if your meal comes with the garlic sauce--order at least one number less than usual. That sauce is pretty spicy! Make sure to get an order of the Pork Belly Steamed Buns!"}
{"text":"Not a single complaint.  Comfortable decor, friendly servers, and excellent food.  Pad Thai was terrific.  Spicy level is a notch higher than I am used to so I ordered the dish at a #1 where I usually order #3.  It was perfect and the prices fantastic!"}
{"text":"I've had mixed feelings about Noodlehead ever since I started going there. The restaurant is beautiful, the BYOB option is cool, and the food is great, but I still can't give them four stars. If I had reviewed them after my visit two weeks ago, I would have given them two stars based on that one night alone.

But anyways... I feel like I should share about the other 20 times I've visited Noodlehead before I complain about my really crappy service on one visit. 

I used to get Street Noodles #2 with Tempura Shrimp and Bok Choy and then I started getting the See Yew. I got bored with both because for whatever reason I just kept eating the same things every time I went there (not Noodlehead's fault because they have a lot of other really great options.) I've recently started to integrate the Pad Thai and Green Curry Linguine and have been impressed each time. Overall, you can't really go wrong with the food. Their food is great and should be rated at least four stars, if not five. 

Service has been hit or miss for me. Sometimes the staff isn't personable. Sometimes it feels like I'm trying to eat at lunch table of a popular kid in high school and I'm just not cool enough.

My terrible visit two weeks ago wasn't great from almost the moment I walked into the restaurant. The visit ended with me leaving my leftovers, walking to my car, walking back, being told through the door that they're closed by the first employee who doesn't listen to what we say and walks away with her hands in the air (its 10:06pm and they close at 10). Then a second employee coming to the door, not listening to me or my friend, and repeating the same \"we're closed\" over and over again. Then a third employee, who could have possibly been a bus boy, comes to the (closed) door and asks me what we need. He then walks away and we're staring through the door at our server who doesn't seem to want to acknowledge that she has made eye contact with us while we're standing there, and then a fourth employee unlocks the door, and hands me my leftovers and we walk away. I didn't NEED my leftovers and I was about to walk away, but my friend mentioned (after the first employee) that maybe they didn't understand and just thought we were there to eat, so we stayed at the door. And it was so weird with the second employee that I actually wanted to talk to someone after she walked away, so we stayed, miming and mouthing that we had \"left food\" there. 

Noodlehead's webpage doesn't have any information (see for yourself), they have no phone (so no phone orders or reservations), and you can't be seated until every member of your party arrives (even if the restaurant is dead and at least half of the tables are open.) 

I'm honestly still weirded out by the experience I had two weeks ago, but went there last week and ordered take out."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in town. I would honestly eat 5 orders of the steamed pork buns as a meal. Everything is that good. My only complaint is that the past few times I've asked for a level 4 spicy it hasn't been all that spicy. Food is still delicious though."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast and tasty. My usual order is the Pad See Ew w/ tofu, 5/5 spice level (I love spicy food!). My boyfriend gets the street noodles, either w/ the shrimp or chicken.

Service is always lacking and the seating is uncomfortable, but whatever...I come to get a quick bite then hurry on my way.

Cash only."}
{"text":"Okay so I still love this place but the last time I went here my noodles were much drier than they were the first time. The taste was delicious but I couldn't ignore the change and dryness...I had to douse it in Sriracha for some moisture and when I ate my leftovers the next day I added water/soy sauce. Hopefully this is a fluke!"}
{"text":"Well...it isn't overly complicated or expensive...just great food! I am from Pittsburgh and I was shocked that there was an Asian place this good (of any kind) in the area (they are few and far between if you didn't notice). Some of you complaining about it being cash only (and taking stars off...seriously?) need to go to a bigger city for a visit...then you will realize that a lot of the good places like this are that way."}
{"text":"The food it was really good, but the attitude is a bit pretentious. I went to meet a friend last week, I had never been there, and I got there first and they told me they couldn't seat me until my whole party was there. It was 130 and the whole front was totally empty so I don't see why I couldn't sit down & have a drink while I waited those 7 minutes, but...
Also, they only take cash, which I had no idea of before I got there. I don't carry cash. I think an established restaurant should do it's patrons the courtesy of taking credit cards instead of being chintzy on the bank fee issue."}
{"text":"This is probably our favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. The price is right, the food is amazing and the staff is friendly too. No complaint. The Chiangmai curry is perfection, and I'm a big fan of the green curry linguine too. Thai fried chicken is also great if you need some protein. Who am I kidding? There is nothing on this menu I don't like. Oh- and takeout means we order from noodlehead at least once every two weeks. Love."}
{"text":"Great place and environment ! Street noodle#1 was really good and came in on time. Prices of foods are average (not very expensive) and its BYOB! Enjoy noodles with your choice of booze !"}
{"text":"As college students my girlfriend and I are always looking for affordable food that isn't cheap or greasy. As huge fans of Lu Lu's Noodles, we wanted to find another option for great cheap Asian noodles. 

After 15 minutes of yelp searching, immediately taken by their website and the simplicity we decided to venture out to Shadyside to check the place out. We went a little early, around 5 and seated ourselves. The place reminded me of a nice little place on the Lower East Side of NYC.

We started with the Pork Buns which were delicious, especially with a little of the chili sauce. My girlfriend got the Pad See Eew which was one of the best we'd ever had and I got the Chiang Mai Curry, which was sweet and spicy and plenty filling. 

Everything was under $10 and delicious. The only downside was some of the seating and low tables were a bit awkward, but the food is worth it. Its also a BYOB restaurant which is awesome, but we just had water. Great food for 2, for under $30."}
{"text":"Tried street #2 and the crispy spring roll, the noodle was good but the spring roll so so. The restaurant is worth a try though."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and got the Chiang Mai Curry and it was delicious.  Every time I've been it was a week night and it was very busy and crowded to the point of being cramped, which was slightly annoying."}
{"text":"Delicious! Perfectly huge portions. Appropriately spicy. Great service. Well done Thai all around! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love taking my family here when they come to visit because everyone can find something they can enjoy, and this is not a family full of adventurous eaters. You can customize your spice level, and they are usually pretty spot on. 

It's BYOB, which is fantastic, considering there aren't too many of these spots in the city. Note that it's cash only, but this actually works to your advantage because the prices are low. Only $9 for noodles!

My favorites are the Chiang Mai and Kee Mao. I get them on the spicy side, and if I'm in the mood for creamy curry with a kick I go for the Chiang Mai. If I'm feeling spicy, chubby noodles, I go for the Kee Mao. You really can't beat the price.

The street noodles are a little greasy for me, but most serious carnivores I know always gravitate toward these dishes because they really pile on the meat.

Try the steamed pork belly buns to start, although they are so filling you may not finish your noodles."}
{"text":"I dream about this place all the time. I've tried everything in their menu and never disappoints. All my guest friends love this place and they keep wanting to come back. Be careful about Spicy level because they changed peppers and mild is super spicy. I got a 5 for a while and after they changed their pepper, I couldnt eat and had to order a 2 and was still dying."}
{"text":"There's a cool, sort of hip ambiance to the place. They have great pork bun appetizers and they take their spice level seriously for the noodles. It makes great takeout too! It is cash only though, and sometimes parking is tough to find."}
{"text":"Fantastic neighborhood byob option! Small but delicious menu of varied noodles and noodle soups. Only complaint is that it's always packed especially around any normal dinner times and the weekend. Cash only, but they have an ATM in back. Great food and easy on the wallet. 2 people can get out under $25 including the small corkage fee."}
{"text":"What can I say, this place isn't bad at all, in fact its actually really delicious but here's my pro/con list for you.

All the food: Delicious.  You cannot go wrong whatever you get.  Beef noodle soup, although not authentically Chinese, Taiwanese, Thai, Viet, is what i LIKE about it.  Anyone who calls this place \"non-authentic\" is missing the point.  It's a fusion of lots of asian flavors, where you can find green Thai chilli in the same dish as fried chicken and noodles--but it works, so put your damn pinky down and take your fancy-flavor discriminating tongue somewhere else.  The Chang Mai curry is surprisingly a favorite among all my friends that have eaten there.  Oh did I mention BYOB? Yeah, awesome.

Not so hot: Pork buns are $6 for 2.  Although tasty.. not worth it, but this is the only place where you can really get any in town.  If it were $4, I'd get them every time.  Also, the service is just a hit or miss.  I personally don't give a damn how you treat me as long as you bring my food out when it's hot and check back in a timely fashion.  One time, in a half empty house, slow service, my waitress with an attitude helped herself to an $8 tip on a $12 bill.  I treat anyone who handles my food with the utmost respect because frankly, I am scared of pubes and spit, but this strange service happens 30% of the time I go there.  Just carry exact change, bring a bottle of wine, and enjoy an awesome meal."}
{"text":"Very delicious Thai style noodle. Not a lot of options, but price is good. My only issue is that the amount of vegetable in each dish is very limited."}
{"text":"Highly recommend! The only downside to Noodlehead is that there's often a wait. But that only shows how popular this place is! All of their noodle dishes that I've tried have been a hit with me. My favorite is the Kee Mao, which is drunken noodles. Most of their dishes you can choose how spicy you want it to be on a scale of 1-5. I love going a little spicy then heading over to Millie's (which is next door) and getting some ice cream to cool off my tongue!

Remember to bring cash!"}
{"text":"I always stop here when visiting from California for my medical appointments. The menu is simple, service is good, and food is great! Can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"This place just makes me happy. The prices are great, the portions are huge, and the flavor is big. If you love Thai food, check it out!"}
{"text":"I have stopped at Noodlehead many times for take out. The food is always good. My husband and I have tried something different each time. 

I am writing this review because Noodlehead does NOT have a phone or I would have called to talk to a manager. I went to the restaurant today. As I waited for my order, I witnessed a waitress/hostess with long blonde hair (few dread locks in the back) who was so terribly rude/mean/disrespectful to several customers. She threw her hands in the air to a lady who was inquiring about a few empty tables and said very rudely and loudly and in the lady's face, \"Be My Guest, take the table!  It is meant for larger parties, but go ahead and do what you want\" And then she threw a glass bottle with such force into the garbage can where I was sitting, it broke in the can. Next, several men were standing in her way and she very rudely said, \"move over there, you are directly in my way\"... Not, \"excuse me\"..  

Customer service and good food go hand in hand. I hope the people who pay her to work for them know how she is treating THEIR paying customers!   I am giving a 2 because of the atmosphere today. I was uncomfortable and embarrassed for the customers."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place!  So it's not like Thai food is very hard to come by around here, but it is always nice to have a restaurant like this in Shadyside.  The first thing you'll notice when you walk in is the decor: dimly lit, modernized, wood accents galore...cozy and cool.  The service was relatively prompt and friendly.  Regarding the menu, while not extensive, it has the essentials.  Being the Pad Thai fan that I am, I ordered up some Tofu Pad Thai and was impressed when it came out: hot, fresh and spiced to my requested level.  What makes this place unique in my eyes, however, are all the great beverage options on the menu!  Mexican coke?  Yep, so good.  Overall, a great meal that did not leave a dent in the wallet.

I'm docking a star because it's cash only.  Seriously, let a dude earn some miles."}
{"text":"We came here because they have pig wings on the menu.  My husband had them at a food festival one time and he was hooked.  The ones here at Noodleheads will not disappoint.  I think you get either three or four for $4?  I know they are reasonable for the quality.  The meat is very tender and clean with a nice flavor.  They also have amazing pork belly with steamed buns.  It may sound like a strange dish but I'm hooked.  This is the only place I've ever had pork belly.  It just sounds so unappealing but for the price, I figured I'd try them.  They are ridiculously good.   I only gave this place four stars because I'm not a huge fan of most of the entrees I've tried.  Their pad thai is really good though.  

Just remember to bring cash and to be prepared to wait when the weather is nice.  There are only three or four outdoor tables but the inside is decorated nicely too."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Given that they get such a huge crowd, the way 4-5 people were managing was really commendable. Talking about the food, it is the best Thai food I have tasted in Pittsburgh. Added to that is the damn cheap price. My wife and I tried pad thai and street noodle 2, both were great. We went a day before the new year eve, it was full, but got place within 10min. Highly recommended, will visit again."}
{"text":"Food is always good here, I've never had to complain! You HAVE to get their steamed pork buns or you've just wasted your trip!!"}
{"text":"Like many other Yelpers have noted, the pork belly steamed buns at Noodlehead are a hit. It's worth getting (at least) one order per person because they are kind of small, but more so because they are sooo tasty you will not want to share. 

The menu is limited, but includes all the favorites and is very reasonably priced. Portion sizes are bigger than I was expecting. I went with my trusty Pad Thai. I ordered it medium spicy (which I think was only a 2/5!) and it was super hot. I like spicy food so I was able to handle it, but even spice lovers should order their dish a notch or two down from what they'd usually order. 

We didn't do BYOB this time but I think there is a small fee for it. Also, it's cash only but they now have an ATM inside the restaurant. 

The dining space is BEAUTIFUL! It's kind of dark inside, lots of dark wood on the walls... it has a very cool feel. 

P.S. When the menu says big flat noodles, they mean BIG FLAT noodles! Those babies were easily an inch and a half wide and thicker than a lasagna noodle. And they had a weird jelly-like texture I just wasn't ready for."}
{"text":"Take out sucks. Portions are pitiful, and when asked for veggies in place of chicken - there were no veggies."}
{"text":"Street Noodle #2
All the Curry
Thai Fried Chicken
Pork Belly Steam Buns
Pad Thai
All 5 stars"}
{"text":"Well of course, five stars. I had the curry chicken, my friend had pad Thai dish. Food was delicious, my spice level was three and that was extremely hot, so next time I shall do less spice. The service was superb, our waitress very attentive. The price? Very inexpensive, hard to believe. I will definitely be back and strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Only been here once, but I was impressed. If you like great spicy Thai, this place is for you. Also love that it's BYOB."}
{"text":"4.5 stars rounding up to 5 stars. Noodlehead is one of those local gems in Pittsburgh which serves authentic Thai noodles dishes. It's actually quite rare to find good, authentic Asian food in Pittsburgh. The truth is there arent just many..and Noodlehead is likely the only one Thai restaurants that serves non-Americanized Thai food at a super reasonable price.

The sukhothai noodle I got was not only super affordable at $6 but also on point. The spicy lime based soup and spice in it took me back to the time I spent in Thailand. It was pretty memorable. I actually had been to Pittsburgh quite a few times 10+ years ago..and boy..they definitely didn't have this type of restaurant in Pittsburgh back then.

They also have other varieties of noodles dishes (many of them are just $9)  like Chiangmai kaosoi noodles that I wished I had time to try as well. Unfortunately, my time in Pittsburgh wasnt so long, so I couldn't get to try other dishes there. The truth was..I actually tried to stop by there again for an early lunch...but I think they opened quite late..so I didnt get to try it again before I leave.

If I lived in Pittsburgh, I would stop by this place often for sure. And oh..bring cash..they don't take credit cards..and be prepared to wait in line if you are going for dinner."}
{"text":"Both the see yew and the beef noodle soup are too salty for our tastes. Nothing remarkable about them either: this is something you can find at most thai places. The pork buns are nice though, worth a try if you do end up here."}
{"text":"Mmmmm fresh noodles. If I lived in Pittsburgh (which I don't), I would eat here once a week. That's really all you need to know...for more info, read all the other reviews! Parking, of course, is awful due to the location."}
{"text":"Vegetarian friendly.

Be warned that this place fills up fast and some tables are very close to the kitchen.

Rather than sit so close we opted for take out (be warned they don't have phones so you have to in person put in your order). 

They are happy to substitute any meat noodle with tofu (just watch out for the type of broth). We loved the Chiang Mai curry noodle with tofu and Mr. Jessica ordered the see yew with shrimp.
We order 1/5 spicy to get a bit of spice and flavor but not to be overwhelmed.

Their service was blistering fast on a packed night. We waited less than 10 mins between ordering and walking out the door with our fresh hot food.

They are consistent and fast and a good noodle fix."}
{"text":"We love this place. The servers are so kind. We've been going since our daughter was 2 months old and one server knows us well. The pork buns are to die for. 
Get the outdoor table if you can - and bring some cold beer to cut the spicyness."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner with my mom tonight. These guys are cash only, so make sure you're prepared before you come. I lucked out and got a parking spot right in front and was seated immediately. We started with the pork sticky buns (so good!) and I got the Chiang Mai Curry, and my mom got the Kee Mao. Both were really good, but my mom said hers was a bit too spicy, even when she asked for it to not be spicy. If I liked close, I'd return here. Waiters were friendly and the meal was very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Location's a pain to get to from campus but...the chicken.  
Street Noodle #1 is fried chicken cutlet perfection on top of flavorful, (spicy) noodles. Even if you get \"a little\" bit of spicy, which I stupidly let the waiter talk me into getting, it will be HOT.  This is apparently not the case for Street Noodle #2, which is fried shrimp, on top of egg noodles which are considerably drier, and less spicy.  

Even with the unbearable burn in my mouth, I was able to enjoy the fried chicken.  The noodles, I couldn't finish :( 

Restaurant is dim and spacey, with a 50cent BYOB per head charge."}
{"text":"Noodlehead was a solid 4.
It is cash only and you can byob?    
Anyway Chiang Mai curry was rich and flavorful, surprisingly filling.   Pad see eaew was delicious. 
Price was good $9 per plate
Service was good
Ambience was like being in an upscale noodle shop.
It's a popular place so...be prepared to wait, but it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I was nearby and hungry so some friends recommended Noodlehead.  I saw several people gathered around the entrance which made the decision to order takeout rather easy.  I made my way through the crowd of people trying to get their name on the wait list.  Once inside, I was unsure where to go to place my order and was ignored by a couple employees before one finally made eye contact and told me she'd be right with me.  Things weren't looking good.

I ordered Street Noodles #1 (with rice noodles, Thai fried chicken, bok choy and cilantro) and the Pork Belly Steamed Buns.  I was told they prepare food pretty spicy so I went with a 1 on their spicy scale of 0-5.  I was told my order would take 20-25 minutes but it took maybe only 10-15.  The Street Noodles weren't anything spectacular.  It was a healthy serving and pretty much what I expected.  They do not, I repeat, they do not mess around with that spicy scale.  If my meal was a 1, I'd hate to try a 2.  I'm happy to report those steamed buns were out of this world (and the main reason I'm giving Noodlehead 3 stars instead of 2).

I can understand it's a busy Sunday evening.  But I waited longer to place my order than it took to make my order.  Perhaps they were short-staffed that night but it just seemed chaotic and could have been more organized at the entrance.  Other deterrents are: cash only, no reservations, no phone.  Noodlehead is, however, BYOB.  The interior atmosphere is cool and casual.  I thought the prices were reasonable (my total was around $16).  I wouldn't be opposed to dining there, in fact maybe the atmosphere would enhance my enjoyment.  I would just need a few extra BYOBs if there's a long wait."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!!! I am not usually a fan of Thai food but I absolutely love the street noodles #1! The noodles are the perfect consistency. Just a tip they are a bit spicy! Even when I ordered a 1 it was still too spicy for me and I am usually a fan of spicy food. Oh and they are cash only!"}
{"text":"BEST THING EVER. I've tried about every dish they have there over the course of my 4 years at CMU and I have not once been disappointed. 

If you follow me on yelp, you'll see that I tend to lean toward spicier food. If youre craving something spicy, but not sichuan, this is the place to go.

My biases are the street noodle #1 or chiang mai curry... I could use myself a plate now."}
{"text":"I have had Noodlehead bookmarked for years now.  I remember seeing people's pictures of their food and thinking I want to eat there so bad.  This is primarily because I am a rice noodle fan and love Thai food.  However I never seemed to find myself here until recently when we were out in Shadyside watching some Pens playoff game at a bar that didn't serve food.  This was a sign.  Others were tempted to order pizza, but a light bulb went off in my head and I was determined to try Noodlehead.

So a couple of things.  They don't have a phone.  I don't know if this is entirely true but if they do have one you can't have the number.  So if you want to grab some takeout you have to go there and order at the counter, to which they do not take cards.  ATM inside and good thing.  After you pay you have to wait in the overcrowded store front for someone to call your order.  The employees do a good job of herding everyone to appropriate areas.   Our food was called and we headed back to the bar to enjoy some noodles and hockey.

I ordered the Kee Mao, big flat rice noodles, bok choy, spicy chili garlic sauce, with shrimp spice level of 4/5.  I also opted to order the Pork Belly Steamed Buns.  Let me say, they don't mess around with the spices here.  If you think you can handle a five, just try a four.  I love spicy food and thought the same, but now after getting a 4, I know a 5 would be way too much heat.  The dish however was fabulous.  I absolutely loved the noodles and the sauce with the crunchy bok choy.  My husband and friend also really liked their meals.  The disappointment was with the steamed buns.  I can't believe those beautifully pictured buns were just so underwhelming.  I found them to be really sweet, and the bun to be a little on hard side, not soft like a steamed bun.  They were very sticky too, just way too much sugar in the sauce.  

Overall great meal, and I'm looking forward trying some of their other offerings soon."}
{"text":"This place is shady side is usually packed with people, even on weekday evenings. Prices are extremely reasonable. This place had been on our bookmarks list for a long time and the day we finally went there we were headed for a long wait. However once we got a table service was pretty fast. 
This place has no booze and they charge 50 cents per person and allow you to bring your own booze. There's a beer store right next to this place which we didn't know about so we just spent 30min in queue waiting and getting bored. 
Once seated we ordered pork dumplings that were served almost immediately. There were 4 in a plate and they tasted fine. We also ordered pad see ew with chicken and green curry linguine with clams. They made it really spicy as we had asked for and it was quite fun. The quantity of food they served was quite large compared to how much they charge. The see ew tasted good. The green curry linguine had a lot of curry and was pretty heavy. However I was really put off when I found little pieces of clam shell in my food. I didn't complain and create unnecessary delay as a lot of people were waiting and the servers were really busy.

This place is great value for money however you have to pay in cash(like so many other places in Pittsburgh). They have an ATM too in case you're not carrying enough with you. They also don't let you modify / customize your order except for spice level. My vegetarian friends seem to like noodle head quite a bit."}
{"text":"The vibe is super dope and I love the interior. As far as the menus, they have less variety than noodles and company. Not a lot of vegetables in the veggie dishes. Fried egg rolls are delicious af! Good flavors just not a lot of variety."}
{"text":"For at least a couple of years, this has been one of my go to places around town. Maybe I'm just getting burned out, but it seems like the quality is becoming less predictable. On some visits I'm happy with the taste, and on others I'm kind of \"meh\" about it. Also, the spice level seems highly variable -- sometimes spicy enough to require lots of water, and sometimes barely spicy at all. Yesterday for example I ordered \"thai hot\" and it was more like \" American mild.\"

Still, the steamed pork buns are always a favorite, and the Sukothai soup is quite nice. I have gotten tired of the Pad Thai, and the Kee Mao which used to be my favorite did not impress last time.

Although I still like this place and find their prices reasonable, I think they lack consistency and hence deserve a slightly lower rating.

Note: cash only, no reservations, no telephone number to call. They do have take-out, but you need to order it in person."}
{"text":"Food is always great!! I'm Thai and I like fish sauce so I ask them for more fish sauce on the side to add to the food. Servers are mostly nice! It's always busy so there's a little bit of wait for everything. But overall I loved it!"}
{"text":"I think about this place at least once a day. The appetizers are so good I could make a meal of them. The pork buns are so delicious and if you add a little sriracha they get even better. The Thai fried chicken is actually beyond words it's so good. The dumplings and egg rolls are good but I would pass for more pork buns and chicken. 

Now for noodles.  You cannot go wrong with street noodle number 2 medium spicy. The shrimp is so nice and crunchy and the noodles are extra good. I've tried their other noodles but always go back to street noodle 2."}
{"text":"Always really busy, but definitely worth the wait. Food is delicious and BYOB is a great feature. Don't forget it's cash only!"}
{"text":"we visited noodlehead for lunch one afternoon while visiting pittsburgh and got down to ordering serious noodle dishes.
we started with the fresh garden roll (raw)
with peanut dipping sauce.
it was outstanding.

I ordered the street noodle #1;
sub'd tofu 4 chix.
my SO ordered the Chiang Mai Curry bowl
and root beer!  no booze is served outdoors...and it was too beautiful a day to eat inside.  it is BYOB.
all orders came promptly and the entrees were piping hot (temperature) and heated (spicyness) up to the level you request: we both ordered #2 and it was perfect!
lunch was great and will definitely eat here again when in the 'burgh!"}
{"text":"Ordered pad Thai with chicken and medium spice. Great flavor and portions was good. Tried some noodle soup and the noodles with the tempora shrimp and I didn't think it was special."}
{"text":"It would be a difficult task to top my two other favorite Thai places in the vicinity, but Noodlehead  surpasses them slightly for its hip and modern atmosphere.

I stopped in with one of my girlfriends per her recommendation on Friday night around 9pm for a late dinner. It was still busy, although they close at 10.  We were worried there would be a wait, but we were seated right away.  The place is big and bustling with a lot of seating, and I have heard it still almost always have a wait!!  

We forgot that it was BYOB (oops!!), but a lot of other tables around us had bottles of wine - and I'm not sure of the corking fee.  We ordered the steamed pork buns to start, and then we both ordered the Pad Thai - mine with shrimp and hers with chicken.  The pork buns were AMAZING.  Soft seamed buns with tangy bbq pulled pork on the inside with pickle slices and cilantro - I could've eaten 10.

Shortly after, our food arrived.  What a huge serving for $9!  It was good - not amazing.  Not better than my other Thai staples Pad Thai dish. Needed some lime and soy sauce to jazz it up.

Next time I come back, I wouldn't be opposed to trying the street noodles or one of the curry dishes.  I would come back for the atmosphere alone.  Our service was mediocre - not bad, but our waitress wasn't very personable.  Pricing was extremely reasonable (cash only) and everything was OK.  I'd try it again!"}
{"text":"Pros: 
Amazing food
Ample portion size
Great prices
Fast service 
Relaxed atmosphere 

Mehs:
BYOB (with corking charges)
Its in Shadyside (good luck with parking)
The spice index is a lie! (try at least 1 level higher than you think you can handle)

Cons: 
No reservations
Entire party must be present before seating
Fills up quickly, hard to find a seat
No telephone (you have to show up for a take out order and wait)
Cash only

The whole \"no reservation\" thing is a bummer, but the food is so good that you pretty much forget about it once you start eating. We had the Sey Yew, Pad Thai, Street Noodles, one of the curries and the pork buns. Everything was delicious, especially the pork buns. Seriously, try the pork buns. They're life changing. 

The only issue I had with the food was the spice index. The waiter explained that the 1-5 spice index was generally hotter than most places, and that ordering a 5 was crazy. One of us ordered a 5, and it was more or less like ordering a 7-8 at a regular Thai restaurant , which is a bit mild if you like spicy food. This was a little disappointing, but they had sriracha bottles and pepper flakes at the table, so it was no big deal.

Were it not for the hassle of actually getting to a seat, Noodlehead would deserve all 5 stars. You should still definitely try this place out, just be sure to come 30 minutes earlier than you normally would. It is, however, worth the wait."}
{"text":"Delicious cuisine at a very reasonable price. The menu is somewhat limited, but everything is oh so delicious. The decor is attractive and it's easy to hold a conversation. Our order came quickly and our waitress was helpful in giving suggestions on what to order. A real winner, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The decor is cute and the atmosphere is quite nice. The staff are always friendly, not like in some of the trendier Shadyside places that try too hard to come off hip. (It's like they've forgotten the fact that they live in Pennsylvania!) The menu is simple, and the spice levels and in some cases types of meat can be customized. Everything here is somewhat spicy but not obnoxiously so unless requested. It's cash only, but there is an ATM on the premises. Since plenty of places in Pittsburgh seem to be that way, it's a feature of dining here that I've finally become used to."}
{"text":"I came to Pitt for a little road trip with my husband and this is a restaurant we stopped by at. We got seats by the window (which was a bit cramped) as there were no more table seating. The waitress offered to move us a couple seats down but it didn't really make much of a difference so we just stayed put. This place doesn't offer a wide variety of menu options. The menu is very limited but it makes deciding what to order a lot easier, especially when you're hungry. I ordered the Chiang Mai curry noodles and my husband ordered the green curry linguine. They have spice levels used to indicate how spicy you want your dish to be. I love spicy but wasn't sure how to gauge the levels so I stuck with a 3. My husband ordered a 4 for his dish. The food service was very quick and prompt. My dish actually wasn't spicy for me at all and I ended up liking the green curry linguine more (my husband ended up liking my dish better so we switched plates). The green curry still ended up not being spicy for me so I ended up adding more sriracha into it. Overall, I think this place is pretty good and if I come back in the future, I am definitely ordering spicier!"}
{"text":"The See Yaw was ok, salty, not as good as Smiling Banana Leaf. Don't order the dumplings, rip off! Spring roll was ok, also a rip off!"}
{"text":"Simple menu.  Really good noodle dishes.  Cash only. 

I'd say this appears to be a better lunch then dinner stop - though it is a BYOB, should you want to wash down your meal with some spirit either mid-day or at dinner time...or all the way through!

The menu offers noodle soups, \"street\" noodle dishes with no substitutions, and more noodles with either shrimp, chicken, or tofu.  Again...short, simple, and to the point as far as the menu is concerned. 

Plus, they also offer some \"snacks\" that are best shared with your dining mates...to which I recommend the Pork Belly Steamed Buns, as they are a can't miss item. 

All in all...this is a really good stop for some really good eats...you just better like noodles because that's pretty much all they've got...and they're dang good, too!"}
{"text":"Have never been here before and my friends had mentioned it before so I decided to check it out. Went and ordered one of the review highlights, the Chiang Mai Curry with the highest advertised spiciness rating of 5. My thoughts of the dish? I didn't really find it to be very spicy at all, seeing as I had no tearing up in my eyes at all throughout eating it. I had to use some sriracha and dump a full cup's worth of red chili peppers into my dish before finding it to be minimally pleasing in terms of spiciness level.
Although the rest of the dish was okay with the pickled mustard greens, shallots, and yellow curry coconut milk sauce, it really did not taste too much like curry (which is supposed to be spicy in and of itself) so the dish ended up being a bit bland. As for the chicken, I personally thought that it was a tad bit too dry (overcooked) so they could definitely do a better job on that. Overall, it was an okay joint. After paying, I was told by my server that there was a secret spicy level \"6\" ... well, it may have been more appropriate to tell me that before I ordered (just a thought). 
Cash only so be prepared by bringing cash beforehand so you don't have to pay the lousy ATM fee for using the joint's onsite ATM in the establishment. In general, I've had better Thai in Pittsburgh, including Smiling Banana Leaf & Pittsburgh Thai by Boris so I'd probably choose these two over this joint. I might come back to try their level 6 spiciness level on a different dish down the road, but other than that I don't really have much motivation to return."}
{"text":"My partner and I stopped in on a whim while doing some laundry down the street. The service was quick, the food was spicy and good, and it was inexpensive. The only very minor complaint I have is that it's cash only, but it was well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about Noodlehead. The food is really good/simple and it's BYOB. I've had the pork belly steam buns almost every time I've gone and they are amazing. The Street Noodle #1, kee mao, see yew, and pad thai are all great too. However, they don't have a phone for take out orders or general questions, they don't take reservations, and it's cash only."}
{"text":"If you plan on going around dinner time, make sure to go at a reasonable time as the wait can be long, but the food is totally worth the wait. With the best steamed pork buns in the neighborhood, it's hard not to return to Noodlehead time after time."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent! Had 3 dishes that were superb. Highly recommend!
Love boat soup-level 3 spice 
Street 2 noodles- level 1 bc of my wife
And the pulled pork steamed buns"}
{"text":"I thought that noodle head was great and they definitely have a very interesting interior. Lots of reclaimed wood and plants- hipster but very airy and enjoyable. The food also very good and left me feeling very full. The one thing I didn't like was that they only accept cash- it's 2016, that's a bit odd."}
{"text":"The porked belly steamed buns are a reason alone to go here! The Kee Mao noodle dish was spicy and very good as well. 

Pro tip: BYOB and cash only!"}
{"text":"Loved Noodlehead! I ordered the street noodle #2 with no bean sprouts and it was very fulfilling. The medium spice level is just enough for a good flavor and kick. Servers were attentive and although it was busy on a weekday lunch, there was still seating available. 

My boyfriend got the street noodle #1 with spice level 1 and it was too spicy for him. So if you're not used to Asian spice, I would start with 0."}
{"text":"It is hip, the service is great and the vibe is inviting and friendly. The price is cheap enough to visit more often than other places. 

When it comes to food, even though it is called Noodlehead, I am not impressed with their fusion noodle dishes. In general the flavors are okay,  but nothing to write home about. However, those Pork Buns are definitely the reason why I go back there from time to time. Even though the portion is a little small, those pork buns are very flavorful and pretty close to home. 

This place is cash-only, they do have an ATM in the restaurant but you will have to pay an extra $2.50 to get cash there, so don't forget to bring cash when you visit."}
{"text":"Considering Thai is my favorite food group (lol) I am on a mission to try all of the Thai that the Burgh has to offer. My mom is a Thai lover as well- so on a beautiful Fall Friday when I had the afternoon off work, we visited Noodlehead. There is some outside seating, but it was a little chilly so we sat indoors. 

Here are a couple things you need to know before visiting:
1. CASH ONLY
2. BYOB! (Only a 50 cents \"recycling\" fee per person)
3. Parking isn't the best- we paid to park at a meter outside of Noodlehead. There is residential parking but it's permit. 

Our server was nice & attentive to our table despite being very busy with a late lunch rush. She brought us glasses for our wine & a pitcher of water for the table shortly after our arrival. We ordered the pork belly steamed buns to start. I heard awesome things & had to try them. For our entrees, we ordered the chicken pad thai (spiciness at a 3), street noodles #1 (spiciness at a 3) with chicken & the beef soup (spiciness at a 1).

Pork belly steamed buns- I have always wanted to try these little adorable Thai sandwiches but wasn't sure where to find them before Noodlehead. They were good & very simple. Basically just BBQ pork in a steamed bun with some pickled cucumber on top. I added sriracha to mine to add some spicy flavor- they literally weren't spicy at all without it. At two per order for $6, there aren't a bad deal- just not as flavorful as I had hoped.

Street Noodles #1- The chicken was AWESOME in this. For $9, the portion of noodles I received was large & the amount of chicken I received was awesome as well. The chicken was fried but the batter was more fluffy than fried tasting. Really tasty. The noodles were disappointing. I understand that Fish Sauce is in A LOT of Thai. I'm not a fish person AT ALL, but I deal with it. In 99% of the Thai restaurants that I have been to, I can't taste the fish sauce in their food. Usually I can't even smell it. This dish was the exception. It had completely too much fish sauce in it. I tried to neutralize it by adding Sriracha- didn't work. I didn't eat much of this dish in the restaurant because I hoped I could \"doctor it up\" at home by adding sesame oil, soy sauce & chili oil, to make it less fishy. I couldn't even eat them then. I'm not sure if it was just a bad day or if these noodles are always this fishy but I wasn't impressed at all with this dish.

Beef Soup- My mom really liked this. I am not really a beef soup person, but the bite I tried was tasty. It had a slight spicy kick to it, which was nice. The portion was huge- what she didn't eat at the restaurant, she had for dinner the next day.

Chicken pad thai- Still fishy. Not as fishy as Street Noodles by ANY means, but it was still fishy. We added fresh lime juice & Sriracha & that seemed to do the trick of neutralizing the fish sauce. After adding those ingredients we really enjoyed it.

I don't want to give Noodlehead two stars- I love the d√©cor of this place, it's rustic & modern, yet still Thai feeling, the presentation of the noodles were great & I am a fan of the prices & the fact that they are BYOB. But I can't give them a good rating considering two dishes we ordered were overpowered with fish sauce. If I have to take a dish home in order to make it better, then the restaurant didn't deliver like they should have. The pork belly steamed buns were also disappointing. I ended up ordering some to-go for the boyfriend & he thought they were bland as well.

I would be willing to return.. everyone seems to love this place, so maybe I just came on a bad day."}
{"text":"I have a been a regular customer and there hasn't been a dish that I do not like from Noodlehead (read: I'm obsessed). Vibe is laid back, service is variable depending on who you get, but requests are always fulfilled. All noodles are priced at $9 with two exceptions (at $6 and smaller portion). My boyfriend loves the steamed pork buns; I, on the other hand, am not a big fan of pulled pork. For those that need gluten-free options, this place can accommodate on almost all items. BYOB as other mentioned, and there is a mandatory $0.50 \"recycling fee\" (even if you take home half-emptied bottles). I've also ordered take-out before: They fill your order super fast, but it definitely tastes better when you eat there.

Keep in mind the No's and you'll be taken great care of: no credit cards, no reservations, no delivery and no phone number to call. They also do not seat until your entire group has arrive (something to keep in mind as parking can get tricky in the neighborhood)."}
{"text":"So my mom and I just ate at Noodlehead. I was expecting an amazing meal based off previous reviews. However, it is very limited for vegetarians. That aside, I was excited for my dish, kee mao. I thought it was very good, but my mother had a terrible experience. Her pad see ew was one of the worst I've ever had--it was so greasy and heavy, and had an odd aftertaste. When she told the server she didn't really care for it and would prefer to have my dish, he told her he would charge her. There was no manager to talk to. When we paid, the server said that because my mom did not explicitly said she doesn't like her dish (semantics), they refused to make accommodations. My mom said that we've had pad see ew that's lighter elsewhere and the server told her to go back to other places rather than eat at Noodlehead. She even acknowledged that they don't really care about customer service. Atrocious--not the way customers are meant to be treated."}
{"text":"Straightforward BYOB Thai-style restaurant; cash-only (ATM available in back). Tasty $9 noodles dishes with a pleasant ambiance, great for dates and small groups. The steamed pork buns, street noodle #1 & chang mai curry are personal favorites! They go \"authentic\" on the spice levels, so be warned! If you order take-out, they do not have a phone, so you must walk-up, order and then wait for take-out.  They are usually very fast and my takeout has always been ready within 10-15 min."}
{"text":"The food here is always consistently good but why don't they take credit card? Or phone orders to go? I would eat here way more often if they made it more convenient, Although I'm not sure my stomach can handle spice level 5 every time and the grease that comes with it. To be honest I've never tried anything here but the pad kew mao and the pad see eew but they're so good that I keep coming back. My boyfriend also never gets anything but the street noodle #1 every time. If you like this place but want a nicer outdoor setting, much larger menu, and are willing to pay a bit more, try Pusadee's garden in lawrenceville, owned by the same people."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food! The bread ban is great, too. The only thing to pay attention is that they only accept cash, and the waiting is long."}
{"text":"Not bad.

Noodlehead to me is an important place. It was the first place I had Thai in Pittsburgh. It was good.

I love thai food. Especially street thai food or the dingy little holes in the wall in Bangkok or Phuket that exude flavor. I have had plenty of it in Thailand. I've had my good friend's mom's home made Thai Food (they're Thai). Thai food is extraordinary. It's a staple to me. So I knows a lil bit.

But Noodlehead is what it is. It's a cute little Thai place serving up quick street noodle dishes if you have cash only or a debit card (which can be used to obtain cash to which you can pay for your meal).

Thai dishes that truly are tasty. Would I say Noodlehead is my favorite, no. Would I eat there again, sure because it's a fun place that will appease everyone's palate.

Is it consistent ...eh, not really. I think the busier they get, things can be a little lackluster, including flavor. I prefer going there during the daytime for lunch or prior to busy nights because that's when flavors really lack. I love coconut and I love thai basil, and when I get a poor blend of the two on more than one nights, I'm calling you out on it!. This is why I gave it 3 and not 4.  

But Noodlehead is too important of a place (not just to me) but also to Shadyside, for me to proceed and pick it apart systematically. That's not the kind of place this is. 

It is to thai food what Mad Mex, In my opinion, is to Mexican food. Fun atmosphere, decent food, and hits the spot. 

Not bad. I'll come here again over and over."}
{"text":"The cash only thing is bullshit. It's 2013, almost 2014. Get with it.

{"text":"The food here is good. Good price. Worth 4 stars actually. However, what disappointed me a lot is the waitress here. So I decided to give 2 stars only. 

1. The servers seem to work just for a short time for the restaurant and then quit. Therefore, the service quality is not consistent at all. Every time I came here, I saw unfamiliar faces.

2. Today, the waitress's attitude angered us. There's no greeting when she came to us, no introduction of herself as well. She never smiled when serving us. However, for another table, she welcomed them with warm attitude and smile. She even said nothing when we said thank you to her for bringing the food. Just do the necessary thing and then leave.

We feel really bad when having a meal there."}
{"text":"One of the best Pad Thai I've ever had!  I always get it with the tofu. I like that they have different levels of spice to choose from.  Cash only!"}
{"text":"Best.noodles.ever! 

I am so happy I decided to check out Noodlehead. I understand the hype and why people love this place so much! 

Let's start with the restaurant's decors. It has dark wood walls that gave off a rustic vibe. The metal tables and chairs gave off a industrial vibe. They all go very well together. 

For starters, we ordered the pig wings because we were intrigued by the name. My sister ordered Pad Thai with shrimp and I got the Kee Mao with tofu. We both ordered our dishes with level 4 spicy level which translated into Thai hot. The pig wings were okay, nothing memorable. They were basically just short ribs and were a little too dry for my taste. But the stars of the show were definitely the noodles. My Kee Mao was delicious and so was my sister's Pad Thai. I love that both dishes came with plenty of veggies. They were both cooked with the perfect spice level. That was a true definition of a Thai hot spice level. We both love eating spicy and were not disappointed. 

The servers here were super nice, upbeat and friendly. Service was very quick. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place if you are looking for good noodles. Each noodle dish was only $9 and came with generous portions. This just cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go when I'm wanting Thai food, the Street Noodles #2 is my go to! The only complaint I have is that sometimes when they're busy I've waited a little longer than I'd like to for my check and once after we were given our menus we were forgotten about for a while, and I've found myself having to blank stare at my waitress to get her to notice me. But the staff are always polite. Keep in mind that their heat scale is no joke, either! I almost always get whatever is in the middle when I'm choosing a heat scale, but if you're not ready to step out of your comfort zone I would recommend ordering one down from what you typically would here."}
{"text":"Cash only - they have an atm inside
BYOB - 50cent recycling fee per person plus there is a fine wine and good spirits store in the plaza down the street (within walking distance)
Street parking for pay - but there are a ton of residential streets nearby for free parking. Sometimes, you can get away with parking in the aforementioned plaza

Expect a wait no matter what, especially on the weekends, since they don't take reservations or call aheads. But it is so worth it! The staff is always kind and attentive. The service is speedy so you totally forget about the wait. 

I ALWAYS get the pulled pork steamed buns. The fresh rolls are pretty good too. I've had the pad thai and the kee mao noodles ($9 each) which I absolutely loved. You can change the spice level, so no need to fear. I have a relatively high tolerance for spice, but I'll still only get a 3 or 4. The Kee Mao already has a spicy garlic in it, so the 3 still gives you enough of a kick."}
{"text":"This is such an inconvenient place on the surface. No cash, no reservations, no phone for take-out....arrrrrgh! But, oh goodness...when you serve food of this quality at this price you can do and say whatever the hell you want! The steamed pork buns are amazing and I haven't had a bad noodle dish yet. It's the best Thai in the city, hands down, and you will leave stuffed and blissfully happy for under $30 for two people. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Very simple restaurant, with an expansive noodle menu. Their pork buns are AMAZING! And their pad thai's are just as great. It is also BYOB, which is great for going in groups for a friend's birthday or just for a simple celebration. I go countless times and I haven't gotten tired of it yet!"}
{"text":"My Saturday night staple. This is the place I take out of towners when I want to give them a taste of modern Pittsburgh (people think that Primanti's is synonymous with Pittsburgh cuisine). 

First, the food. When going to noodlehead there are things that you must do: you must start your meal with the steamed buns; if you don't you're only hurting yourself. These are more than just appetizers, they're flavor adventures. The first time I took my father here, he ate three orders of them. On the outside they're warm and soft cheese Asian buns (that sounds kind of dirty), tasty tender pork on the inside, and topped with crunchy cilantro and pickles. If you haven't yet found God, you might find him in the steam buns; these classify as a religious experience. As for the rest of the menu he really can't go wrong so far away. 

The atmosphere is modern and cozy, but remember they don't take credit cards, they don't have a phone, and they don't take reservations. Probably because they don't need to do any of those things and they know it."}
{"text":"My obsession with Noodlehead is real. Every time I come to Pittsburgh to visit my sister I would request to eat here, and I would crave it sometimes and text my sister how much I miss Noodlehead (and her). My favorite is the pad thai. The texture of the noodles is just perfect. Can you guys PLEASE expand to Columbus and save me the three-hour drive?"}
{"text":"Oh Noodlehead. Sweet Noodlhead. Your like a flower petal floating oh so delicately on the water. A first kiss with a new lover, never to feel that rush again. But I'm a Creep. I'm a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here? But wait! Don't run away! Your Chiang Mai Curry intoxicating. Your Steamed Buns moist, yet firm to the touch. Come to me once more Noodlhead. Come."}
{"text":"Decent food.  Garbage service.

I've eaten here before but they seem to have gone downhill.  Showed up, left our name, stood outside.  The hostess said it would be 30 mins; it was fairly busy.  We sat down and our waitress (I don't know her name because she didn't introduce herself) said \"Are you ready to order?\".  We ordered apps and entrees.  The apps came out.  1 into the apps the entrees came out.

Send the apps.  Once we've taken a bite, check on us to see that everything is ok.  Send the entrees at the appropriate time so the moment you're bussing our app plates the entrees arrive.  Coursing 101.

We had both courses and about 2/3 of the way in the waitress did a drive by and said \"everything good?\" and kept walking.  A different waiter dropped off water.

We didn't see our waitress for another 20 minutes easy.  We had long been done so I went to the counter to get a check.  A different waiter was making change at the register.  I was invisible to him.  The hostess came up 3 different times.  I was invisible to her to.  Finally the waiter asked what I needed.  \"We haven't seen our waitress in 30 mins.  I need a bill and 2 boxes.\"  

Someone brought our bill and 2 boxes (and left our dirty dishes on the table).  As we were walking out, I saw our waitress walking towards our table with our bill in her hand.  Everyone seemed infinitely more concerned with turning tables as quickly as possible.  We can get noodles elsewhere."}
{"text":"I saw how many high reviews Noodlehead had and couldn't wait to try it. Thai Cuisine is usually my go-to, but I figured, let's try something new. So I went to order and realized they don't have a phone? Orders are all done at the restaurant. I guess that's kind of cool, but also a little bit of an annoyance when you want to order to-go. I ordered the See Yew and realized... big flat noodles are NOT for me. I don't know if they were over cooked or what but they weren't good. The sauce just tasted like soy with extra sugar and there wasn't much of it. I don't recommend. My husband, on the other hand, ordered the Chaing Mai Curry and it was delicious - Curry was flavorful, noodles were good, it was great. I would try Noodlehouse again, but would not order the See Yew or another flat noodle dish again."}
{"text":"They have a very small menu and they dont have any official phone number and they only accept cash"}
{"text":"Great place! The food was delicious. The pork belly buns were my favorite  Had Street Noodle #1 and Pad See Yew - personally liked the latter better. Cozy environment too :)"}
{"text":"I like a lot of things about this place. The server was friendly and we got our food soon after ordering. The decor is lovely. The menu is simple, but full of delicious choices. (Still had a hard time choosing what I wanted though because everything looked yummy.) Felt like we got a good amount of food for what we paid. 

We ordered the Pork Belly Steamed Buns, Thai Fried Chicken, and the Pad Thai. I thought they were all tasty, though nothing extraordinary. My boyfriend who doesn't usually like noodles actually liked the Pad Thai, so that's saying something. A great place to go for a well done Thai food in a somewhat hipster atmosphere. I would definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"The food and prices at Noodlehead get 5-Stars. Everything on the menu is $9.00 and tastes amazing! The only thing that stinks is that they are cash only, don't accept reservations, and they do not have a phone so you can't call in a takeout order.  If you want to bring their delicious grub home you have to drive there to order it and wait... and they are always crowded.   That being said, if you have the time, it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"You say \"pork bun,\" I say \"I'm there.\" Which is why I'm so happy to have gone to Noodlehead where they have the buns in the style made popular by Momofuku. Crisp pickles, cilantro, steamed bun, and pork belly. Granted, it's not THE best pork belly I've ever had, but it was really satisfying and pretty cheap for an order (which was two buns, not one).

Now, you say \"pad thai,\" and I say \"I will eat any pad thai, but the best in Pittsburgh is still at Spice Island.\" That being said, it was still really good. I also tried a tempura shrimp and was immediately jealous, because it was perfectly fried. But, I stuck to my well-portioned Pad Thai and was happy it was just enough noodles, because I wouldn't have been able to stop eating it.

My only disappointment about the food choices is that you're really limited if you're vegan or a vegetarian who doesn't eat shrimp. Tofu isn't an option for your protein, and for the same price to say \"just leave off the meat\" you should really get something in replacement.

Noodlehead keeps their menu simple (and filled with delicious cilantro and lime), and their costs down, by saying these dishes are $6 or $9, here are some appetizers, here are some drinks, seat yourself, plastic chopsticks or utensils are at your table already, if you want beer or wine you bring it (.50 corkage per person), cash only.

The space is beautiful still from when it was a more upscale restaurant (Typhoon), delightfully juxtaposed with picnic tables, well-loved cafe tables, noodle bar seating, and other various mis-matched tables. They played good music (Amy Winehouse for the duration of our meal), they staff was really nice, and it just made a great place for a date. A casual, low-pressure, intimate date."}
{"text":"My family and I went here because it is on a list I found called restaurants in Pittsburgh you need to eat before you die. Noodlehead is definitely a place you need to try. If I could rate higher than 5 stars, I would. It's not expensive and the food is amazing. It's cash only so prepare accordingly but I got the pad Thai and kee mao. I liked the pad thai more but the kee mao was good too. My entire family loved this place and I guarantee you will too!"}
{"text":"Like Amanda J., I wouldn't call myself a huge Thai food aficionado.  Having said that, I've tried several of the standby Thai food eateries around PGH, so I have a decent standard of comparison.  While Noodlehead is quite different than many run-of-the-mill Thai places in terms of atmosphere and style of food served, IMO, it ties Nicky's for best Thai restaurant in PGH.

I visited with a friend for the first time the Fri. before last.  Despite not accepting reservations or having a phone, they're on NoWait.  I didn't realize this until we arrived and it was too late (I should be in the habit of checking by now), but even so, we only ended up waiting about 20 min. for a table.  When we were seated, it was at one of the back tables, which are communal and picnic style--fine for us, but something that might not be ideal for a date.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, it was rather chilly where we were seated.

As an appetizer, we ordered the steamed pork buns ($6) to share.  They were super flavorful and delicious, reminding us of BBQ pulled pork (we're BBQ aficionados) with a soft, foldable bun.  For our entrees, I ordered the street noodle #1 with Thai fried chicken, and my friend ordered the Chiang Mai curry ($9 each).  Given that spice levels here run from 1-5, I went with a 2 and my friend went with a 3, which were perfect for our tastes.  While I'm not exactly sure what defines fried chicken as Thai per se (seasoning, perhaps?), it was deliciously crispy and moist, as well-made fried chicken should be.  The noodles, which were of the thin variety, soaked up the sauce, which was mouthwateringly savory and piquant.  While I can't speak for the Chiang Mai curry myself, it's one of my friend's favorite dishes to order here due to the richness of the sauce and the crispy lo mein noodle topping.

Needless to say, we were quite impressed with our meal at Noodlehead.  The only drawbacks concern matters other than the food, i.e. (1) the wait; (2) the ambient temperature; and (3) the cash only policy (not a huge deal for me, but a consideration for many, incl. my friend).  If you're looking for Thai food that's slightly edgy but not super pretentious, quality food on a budget, or are in the area, give Noodlehead a try--I daresay it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"I like this location and thought it had a really cool interior with trendy people.
It was busy and hard to get a seat.
I ordered the shrimp with a spicy garlic sauce and flat noodles that I love.
It was ok. I have had better.
Oddly, they only take cash, no credit so you have to use their ATM to pay and pay the ATM fee."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is awesome. I love the no frills ambiance of this place - from no reservations to no plastic. The entrees all cost like $9 each and are very filling. The decor is this mix of industrial/rustic (I guess?) and it really works. We typically hit it up on the weekdays to avoid lines. 

Tip #1: if you go 1 up on the heat scale - it's a big jump! I'm pretty sure that heat scale is on an exponential curve. :) 
Tip #2: You can sub tofu for chicken on the chang mai curry dish
Tip #3: It's byob.

Oh by the way, I have enjoyed everything I have ever ordered here."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUMMMM! Noodlehead made my top 5 restaurants of all time. I love good, cheap, and simple eats, and this met all three of my criteria.

My sister and i just got done with a full day of info sessions at a grad school open house. So I was starving. When she said that Thai was one of our nearby options, I voted yes, but sighed when I thought about how much it would cost me to cover dinner. But everything is so reasonably priced here! And the menu wasn't crazy complicated.

We ordered the pork dumplings, she got the soup ($6), and I got the Pad See Ew (my absolute favorite - $9). They allow you to customize the level of spicy for each dish, and I am really grateful that our waitress warned us that their chili flakes are a lot spicier than we may be used to because I ordered my food at a level of 3/5 and my nose was running. And I choked a little bit after the first bite. But it was all so good. lol

The portions are huge, so we left there very satisfied. 

Cash only, but there is an ATM nearby.

If I went to school in Pittsburg, I promise this would be a weekly thing for me."}
{"text":"A great noodle house with a simple menu. The best steamed pork buns that I've tried - tender meat, fresh cilantro and cucumber, and some unrecognizable sauce that's amazing. My favorite dish there is the Chiang Mai, but I tried the see yew last night. I didn't love it as much as the Chiang but it was still hot and delicious. Be careful with your spice level!!"}
{"text":"Hands-down the best Thai in town
(I have no idea how authentic it is since I'm not Thai and have never been to Thailand)
I first went to this place two weeks ago and have visited three more times since. I tried their pad Thai, loveboat, street #1, pulled pork buns and liked them all. Adequate portions, affordable price($6 for smaller noodles, $9 for bigger ones). Definitely would visit (many times) again!"}
{"text":"I went to Noodlehead last week for the first time and was very happy with the experience. The overall ambiance of the restaurant is very relaxed with cool interior decor and lower lighting. For an appetizer we ordered the Steamed Pork Dumplings and thought they were great. For the main meal, I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken with no spiciness (because the waitress warned me that their spices were very hot), so she brought a little dish of the spices on the side for me to add to my liking. The prices are reasonable (cash only), everything was delicious, and there was enough food to take home leftovers for dinner the next night. If you enjoy Thai food, I would recommend checking out this spot."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food was amazing, very flavorful and filling. Was a very good price, but remember to bring cash."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh. The dishes are all pretty tasty, and everything is very reasonably priced. I typically handle a moderate amount of spiciness in my food, but I've found that when they ask you to select a spiciness for your dish, it's better to select conservatively, because they can be pretty serious about it! Other than that, just remember to have some cash on hand, and enjoy the menu."}
{"text":"This place is probably the cheapest restaurant that offer good quality food. It's nice and all but I wish they would switch up the menu a bit. Service is always great tho. Keep doing an awesome job."}
{"text":"Two meals from here have been great. One was takeout which was prepared super fast which was nice.

I have no problem with cash-only, but the no phone thing is is a hipster hair away from being pretentious."}
{"text":"Noodle Head is really awesome if you're looking for a BYOB Asian restaurant. The steamed buns are my favorite in Pittsburgh.

The portions are great and they seem pretty consistent in the heat levels. I enjoy spicy foods and am always content.

Everyday Noodles has better noodles, but Noodle Head does spicy better.

As a note, they are cash only."}
{"text":"Let me tell you how hard it was for me to visit this place.  It's not to complain, just to show how forgetful I am.  I love the stretch of Highland that Noodlehead sits on.  There is so much life on this small strip that the sidewalks become congested rather easily and parking is horrendous, but that doesn't stop people from lining up to get in here.

Another reason I had been avoiding coming here was my new found allergy to peanuts.  Not knowing how this allergy could be set off I decided to steer clear of here until I had properly addressed this.  Once I had my ducks in a row all I needed to do was remember to bring CASH.  I rarely carry cash on myself, becoming a follower of the technology movement.  This time I had made plans ahead of time to visit here and stopped to get myself some cash.  Cash in hand I headed to Noodlehead.

The inside is very welcoming.  It feels very open and almost natural inside.  You are greeted promptly, when I was here we were told to take a seat wherever we please, we had picked a time before the line starts to form outside, so lucky for us the place wasn't crowded.

My companion I was with had raved about how good the food was so I leaned on him for suggestions.  He had been here multiple times and knew his way around the menu.  We had started our meal with Pork Belly Steam Buns.  For something so little it was packed with a lot of flavor.  So savory that I wished I had just ordered a multitude of those as my main meal.  It was one of those food that you just wanted to suck all the flavor out of until your tongue wrapped around that pork belly and you made sure every single taste bud got a sample of that flavor.  My mouth is watering thinking about it right now.

I was happy to see that water was brought fresh to every table upon being seated.  But I was also happy to see that they had sodas on the menu that I could actually drink.  Whenever a restaurant has Sprite from Mexico on the menu they always get bonus points in my book.

For my main course I had decided I would give the Beef Soup a try.  I was a little puzzled when I was asked what level of spice I wanted.  Not knowing for sure I deferred to my companion and thought that the suggestion to get it at a low level but have more brought out with my meal in case I wanted to up the heat was a brilliant idea.  The mixture of the fresh vegetables and perfectly cooked beef was the best.  The thin rice noodles were to die for.  But I loved the bean sprouts and bok choy the most.  They added a crunch to this dish that made it feel a little more like a meal rather than a soup.  Unfortunately for me, I could not devour this big bowl of soup.  I was so full after about half that I had to stop eating.

The staff in here were great.  They were so friendly and knowledgeable about the menu/establishment.  Might I also say that they were fast as hell?  My god, maybe it was the time we were there, but they were lightning fast.  Everything we ordered showed up in no time flat.  

This place is definitely a reason for me to carry cash around.

**ATM on site (found this out afterwards), BYOB**"}
{"text":"This place is a must try if you're in the area and like Thai noodles. We always go around 5 in the evening and there's not too long of a wait. In fact, this time we went in around the same time before and got seated right away :) but expect a wait if you come around dinner prime time or on the weekends. 


I've tried their chiang mai curry and loved it. Street noodles #1 and #2 are so good too. You won't be disappointed of their fried chicken! For appetizers, go for the pulled pork steamed buns! Mmmm yummy :)"}
{"text":"Based on all the great reviews about Noodlehead, I was pretty psyched to go there this past weekend. Unfortunately, that excitement pretty much disappeared as soon as I walked in the door.

First off, cash only. Not a deal-breaker, by any means, but it would be helpful if they had prevalent signs stating so. The only mention of cash-only that I saw was on the menu. By the time you see the menu, you're already in the door and making an exit to hit up an ATM is awkward. (To be fair, I've since heard that there's an ATM on-site... but if you want to avoid ATM surcharges, I'd suggest stopping at your bank's ATM before you arrive).

Second, I am a party of 1. There was a party of 3 in front of me and 2 behind me. I stood there, waiting my turn to get seated as the hostess completely overlooked me and asked the people behind me if they were a party of 3 as well (assuming I was with them). Once I made it clear I was there by myself, the hostess seemed confused and then walked away. A few minutes later, she seated the 3-top in front of me. After that she mentioned in passing that I could sit at the counter that overlooks S Highland, and then proceeded to seat the people behind me. I should mention that all of the seats at the counter were open the entire time; she could have asked me to have a seat there when she asked if I was part of the group of people behind me. It also bugs me a little that she never asked if I wanted a table seat in the actual restaurant instead of at the counter. I guess single diners don't get the same options as couples.

Once I had finally seated myself, the server came over with water and handed me the small menu. After a few minutes, I'd made my decision: Street Noodles #1. The server came back in a reasonable amount of time to take my order, but barely even spoke to me - he handed me my water and menu without speaking and then when it was time to order, came over and simply asked, \"Are you ready?\" I was not offered any other drinks, and the server never suggested any apps. Basically, the only words he spoke to me the entire time I was there were \"Are you ready?\" And, while I'm on the subject of the server, one piece of advice from a server/bartender - give your servers some substantial paper to use to take orders. The guy who waited on me fumbled around trying to find the world's tiniest post-it note so that he could write down my order. Maybe less time spent fumbling about for paper would yield better customer service?

To the restaurant's credit, the food arrived quickly, and the chicken in the Street Noodles #1 was very good. Moist on the inside, crispy on the outside. The noodles, though... maybe I was just too into the chicken to even notice the noodles in this dish. I saw maybe 2 forkfuls of noodles, swimming in a runny sauce below the chicken. So for all you people who keep saying Noodlehead is a great value, what on earth are you ordering? Because the meal I paid $9 for was worth, in my estimate, at most $5. I left the restaurant still very hungry since the meal consisted almost exclusively of a chicken breast and sauce. Though, to be fair, the chicken was the highlight of the trip. Did I just order the wrong thing? Who knows.

I should also mention, the restaurant was not very busy - it was 6:00 or 7:00 on a Sunday night - but no one came over, not even once, to see how my meal was. The only time I saw my server after he dropped my food off and ran was when he came to take the dish away (didn't ask if it was good or bad or if I needed anything else) and dropped off the bill before walking away again. 

I came into Noodlehead happy and excited to try a new place, but I left feeling disappointed, hungry, and with the distinct feeling that my existence was a nuisance to my server. I don't think I'll bother returning."}
{"text":"So far so good. Was so excited to see this place open! We had the steamed pork belly buns...very good with what looked like homemade pickles. I tried three different dishes all of which were delicious, the yellow curry noodles, the pork soup, and the street noodles 2. Everything was very fresh and the inside is really well decorated. My only complaint is that portion size seemed inconsistent. All noodles are $5 or $9. The two $9 dishes didn't seem equally as substantial."}
{"text":"I've been to Noodlehead twice so far and cannot wait to go again. I ordered the street noodle #2 both times, I would love to try something else but this dish is so delicious I couldn't make myself order another. They put so much shrimp over a generous bed of  thin egg noodles! I've tried it at both spicy level 4 & 5(I LOVE spicy foods). 5 or \"Crazy hot\" was very spicy but quite delicious, however I preferred the \"Thai hot\" flavor of spicy level 4.
The atmosphere is great for close conversation. I've read many complaints about the service, but I appreciated that they weren't in my face during the meal. I never felt like I was being rushed, yet they promptly removed dishes when we finished a course. 

It is cash only which it states clearly on the menu board outside, on the menu, and I believe even on the door as you enter and with their clear cut menu approximating the cost of your dinner is a breeze.

Seriously try Noodlehead, you wont regret it."}
{"text":"I was brought here by my friend who lives in Shadyside... and I thank her every time I get a chance to. 
I love spicy food. In a scale of 1-10, I'm a 20. Noodlehead is the first place that definitely lives up to its spice level. Their blend of spice & taste is perfect. I don't like it when it's just hot for no reason & has no taste. Their steamed pork buns are a must. I always have their Chiangmai curry & make sure I have left over buns so I can dip it in after. The place is great, it's trendy yet very homey. Did I tell you all their dishes are also reasonably priced? For their delicious & very well proportioned dishes, the cash only establishment is worth the small hassle of making sure you have some cash on you"}
{"text":"Finally! A fuss free yet trendy restaurant serving simple legit south East Asian food! Coming from SEA, I've been searching for good places in Pittsburgh, and I've finally found one! We ordered the Kee Maw and Chiang Mai Noodles, both on spice level 4. Delicious! The Kee Maw particularly, since it was a wok fried noodle, had a wonderful 'wok hei' (wok charred) taste. 

Some notes - their menu is very simple, don't expect to have the usual bombardment of choices you get at other 'Asian' restaurants in the U.S. Their sauces are generally a lot sweeter than those you would find in SEA, but not overwhelming and still very delicious! Spice level 4 was nothing for us - definitely try 5 if you're used to eating spicy Asian food. 

Also had the fresh veggie rolls and home made lemongrass tea, which was lightly sweetened, fresh and delicious! 

Also, we sat outside and received excellent, quick, fuss free service. Extremely happy with this place - will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Best pork buns in pgh. Everything is usually phenomenal. I've been here at least 20 times over the past year and a half, and it's been a little off once or twice but I'll always recommend this place to everyone. It has something for every type of eater, so it's great for picky weirdos.lol I always get the see ew with chicken, fried chicken and pork buns are a must"}
{"text":"Ok, so maybe this restaurant is a little difficult. BYOB, cash only, and they don't even have a phone. But the food here is SO GOOD that it's worth it! I dare you to find a more satisfying meal for under $20. 

We started off with the sweet potato triangles ($4 for 6). These were piping hot fried wonton skins filled with pillowy mashed sweet potato. They came with the typical spring roll dipping sauce. Really tasty!

They serve about 8 different noodle dishes affordably priced at $9. There's a variety of chicken, beef, and shrimp options, but everything can be made with tofu. I had the pad see yew and my friend had the pad kee mao (similar to drunken noodles). The wide rice noodles were absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked! Both dishes had a ton of flavor and a generous portion of veggies and tofu mixed in. 

One thing I noticed is that the heat levels were slightly different between the two dishes. You choose your desired spiciness and we both asked for medium. But because the see yew has a sweet black soy sauce, it was less spicy than the kee mao, which has a chili garlic sauce. So if you don't like spice, pay attention to the ingredients in your dish when you're ordering!

Our waitress was super friendly without being insincere. The atmosphere was really cool but overly so -- there seemed to be a lot of families and kids eating here too!

It's kind of too bad that they don't serve alcohol, but luckily there are a bunch of beer and wine stores in the area. BYOB is $0.50 per person. And the waitress was happy to provide us with a bottle opener!

I left here totally stuffed, but Noodlehead happens to be right next door to Millie's Homemade Ice Cream, another Pittsburgh gem. You can always walk around the neighborhood to digest before grabbing dessert!"}
{"text":"I came here twice this past month and both of my experiences were great! The food is literally mouthwatering and the vibe of this restaurant is really trendy. I came on a Saturday night both times and I ordered the Pad Kee Mao/ Drunken Noodles along with a Mexican coke. The wait time was about 20 minutes and the restaurant is cash only but they have an ATM in the back. I took off one star because they don't have a phone (so you can't call ahead to order and then pick up, you have to drive to the restaurant and make the order in person to carry out) and they also don't serve any thai iced tea. Overall I'd definitely recommend it for eating in."}
{"text":"I was excited to see they have a street noodle #1 just like Pusadee's. That's my favorite Thai dish of all time with bok choy, rice noodles and the best crispy thai fried chicken that makes my mouth water just thinking about it. It was very comparable in both taste and price to Pusadee's. I also got to try a pork steam bun which made for a nice little appetizer. You get two buns per order. The only downsides to this joint is that they won't seat you until your whole party is there and it is cash only. I really don't think there is any legit reason to be cash-only in 2018. It is just the cost of business to be able to process card transactions."}
{"text":"Great addition to S. Highland! My husband and I were extremely impressed by the dishes and the atmosphere inside. We had a slight wait, arriving around 7 on a Friday night, but we're happy to seemly beat a greater rush. We started with the pork buns and despite being non-traditional, we thought they were the best we've had in Pittsburgh and loved the cucumber crunch. I had he pad Thai and he had a fat noodle dish with tofu and we both wiped our plates clean. The medium spiciness may be a bit mild for some, as it was perfect for someone like me who only likes a small kick. 
The prices were also a highlight, only $9 per entree and we will definitely partake in the BYOB next time! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food and ambiance were great! I got the Kee Mao and it was delicious. Be careful with the spice level though they're not lying when they said it's spicy. Great place for vegetarians too because you can substitute tofu for basically all the dishes."}
{"text":"Went in to order a dish vegan and gluten free as I've had in the past at this restaurant. Apparently, serving me the dish in the past was a \"misunderstanding\" as it can be either gluten free or vegan, but not both. Dietary restrictions are serious, and while I'm ok, it is not ok that it wasn't taken seriously."}
{"text":"I had take out and it took about an hour before I actually got to eat it, but the food was still warm. Their kee mow is delicious, but a little bit on the greasy side. The chicken is pretty tender. The sauce is amazing and flavorful. The noodles are wide and flat, and didn't really clump. I had the spiciness of 2, which is just the right amount of spiciness for me."}
{"text":"Nice decor, quick service, delicious food, cheap, big enough seating, BYOB. 
Cash only, only 1 check, have to go in person to order take-out, no telephone/open table to make reservations. 

Despite all the non-traditional quirks, I would recommend the place for a quick bite on a budget."}
{"text":"The see yew, I can't say enough about the see yew. It's just SO good. The pork buns appetizer- I don't know what the heck they put in those but they are the most incredible appetizer I've ever had. And thankfully they have legit amounts of spice. I've gone to other places in Pittsburgh and ordered a dish with 10/10 spice to end up pouring siracha all over it anyway because it was so weak. Here if you order a 3 or 4 out of 5, it's actually got kick. And it's super trendy which is cute. Yeah it's cash only and doesn't have a working phone which is really annoying but whatever I love it anyway."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving 4 and not 5 stars is the seating.  None of the chairs have backs so you have no place to hang a coat or your purse. The food however was amazing.  I went for the first time on 12/30 and went back a second time on 1/2. The pulled pork belly steam buns are amazing! AMAZING! On my first visit I had the Chaing curry level 1....it was spicy, but I am a spice wimp. The chicken was moist and the noodles cooked perfect. Today I had Street noodle 1 - Thai fried chicken level 1. Not as spicy as the curry and just as delicious. My better half had the Beef Soup level 3 and didn't think it was spicy enough! Show off! He said everything was cooked very well, but wasn't a fan on the thin noodles.  God help my waste line!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh, hands down. Every experience and dish I've had here has been phenomenal. I'm a Street Noodle #1 girl myself, but the Love Boat is amazing too. Love the ambiance and servers in this place, everyone is always friendly and happy to make your meal a great one. I will always be back for more. I love you Noodlehead!!!"}
{"text":"Decent place, except for big boobs on a power trip. 

Stopped here on our month-long road trip because of great reviews. After placing our order, husband and I chatted about how beautiful the space was, the floral arrangement, the design, the decor. We were impressed, enjoying ourselves, and excited about our upcoming meal. I snapped some photos with my phones of the pretty things.

Then a waitress, not ours, walked by and asked why I was taking photos. I was a bit confused but told her they were just for me. Then she said people need to not come here to take photos with their big equipment (though she acknowledged that I was just using my phone, she went on nonetheless...) and how it is annoying when it is busy (it wasn't. Off hours, and there was only one other table besides us. I was nowhere near them. She herself didn't have a table to wait on at the time, and yet...) That I should have asked if i was allowed to take photo, and they would have said no.

Firstly, I would be really surprised that such hipster restaurant or any business these days would have a problem with customers taking personal PHONE photos while there. 

Secondly, even if I was mistaken, a simple \"Would you mind not taking photos?\" would have sufficed. Or better yet, a sign. Although I see plenty of photos from customers online, so I am not sure if someone was just in the mood to show off that day or what.

We ate through many different states in a month, and this was the worst we were treated. Shame, it was such a beautiful place. I love the concept, cash only, no phone, and all, and enjoyed the food ok. Would have been great without the rude chest-puffing encounter."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is delicious. I always get the See Yew noodle dish with a higher spice level or their vegetable spring rolls and Thai fried chicken. Dining in is a great experience. The service is quick and attentive. I live in the neighborhood so I love walking to the restaurant and getting a take out order to avoid the long lines that can sometimes form to dine in. Again, the food never takes more than 15 minutes. They are cash only so be aware of that ahead of time but there is an ATM on site. I wish they had a telephone so orders could be called in ahead of time."}
{"text":"Favorite Thai food in PGH! And they employ refugees at a fair wage, so can feel good about your money spent. Ki Mao, add broccoli is the business!"}
{"text":"Want the best Thai food you've ever had for a reasonable price? Noodle head is the place for you! BYOB and cash only but the best around"}
{"text":"Went on a friend's suggestion and fell in love! The ambiance is great, casual and always busy and bustling with good energy! I had the chicken wings and sew me noodles? I think that's what they were called- the best part- GLUTEN FREE NOODLES! Yay, the rice noodles I was able to eat and enjoy! They have great portions and you can tailor your meal to
The spicyness of your choice! I would recommend this for sure! And it's BYOB!!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place for the environment and the food is always consistent but the only downside is that it is cash only :( anyways moving on... I love the decor it's very inviting and kind of sets the mood! I usually get the Street noodles 2 or pad kee mao mildly spiced highly recommend both!"}
{"text":"Just order a See-Yew with SHRIMP as a take-out around today 1pm. 
At home, I realized that I got a See-Yew with chicken. 
I totally wasted my money.

Need to train the servers better. 
No phone number to make a complaint."}
{"text":"Your feelings about noodle head will be determined by your answer to the following question. Do you enjoy delicious and wonderful things? Oh you do? Then noodle head will be a favorite destination for you. The menu is focused with an incredible and authentic range of flavors and dishes.  The noodles are freshly made comfortably affordable and a delight. Start with the steam buns and make sure you BYOB."}
{"text":"Tasty basic noodle options- Thai-ish with a touch of Chinese-ish influence. Ambiance is hip, food is pretty good. Spicing is a bit uneven, so be warned. My 4/5 spicy shrimp See Yew was barely spicy, somewhat sweet, pretty tasty and Chinese-ish in flavor profile. My husband got a 3/5 spicy beef soup, which was Thai-themed and flavorful. We both took home leftovers, which is always great!"}
{"text":"I usually love noodlehead. As a veteran of 3 years, the food is cheap and delicious and the waitstaff is pretty great. You might be wondering why I gave this place one star... Today I brought two of my friends here. Some of the kindest guys I know. There was a group of around 10 of us and we were a little rowdy (as sometimes groups of college aged students are at noodlehead). Regardless, the manager told us to \"chill out\" and then continued to single out my two guy friends. She said they came in often and \"were always rowdy\". My friends are African and are by no means regulars at noodlehead. They tried to point out the managers mistake but she adamantly kept insisting that they had been there many times before and acted the same way. It felt really pointed and inappropriate. Another one of my friends said she had interacted with the manager before in a negative way and that the whole situation was unwarranted. I hope in the future they decide who to profile because this was extremely disappointing. Do better."}
{"text":"Only went here one time but I'm already a fan! Their menu is simple and easy and great for sharing. They have appetizers and small noodle bowls that are good if you want to try a little of each. I had the chiang mai curry which was delish. I love how it came with a layer of crispy noodles on top of the curry noodles. And also..it's BYOB and there's wine store a few mins away... ; )"}
{"text":"Food came out super super quick and was overall very delicious! I got the sew yew which I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was very good! I got the chaing curry and it was creamy and had a great spicy coconut taste (I ordered spice level 2). The pork steamed buns were as good as everyone in here say it is. SO GOOD! My only compliant is the uncomfortable chairs with no backs. They are so uncomfortable and hard. Otherwise noodlehead has a new fan!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant of all time. Amazing, laid back, gorgeous rustic ambiance. Service is always friendly. Most of all, this is some of the most amazing food you will ever eat with equally amazing prices. Nothing is over $9 and you will get a huge portion no matter what you order. It's also BYOB. I seriously could not ask for more...I'm going into my senior year of college in Pittsburgh and I'm so sad that once I graduate I can't go anymore so I'm going to go every month! 
My favorites are the chiang Mai noodles and the love boat soup. Skip the basic safe option of pad Thai here, the rest of the options are so so so delicious and too good to miss out on! 

If you gave this place a bad review, you have issues and you are the devil in human form :)"}
{"text":"This place makes very tasty noodle dishes!  You choose one their preparations from a list of about 8 options. You can choose your spice level and meat, and that's it!  It is always super tasty and consistent. Most impressively it is a tremendous value. The interior is modern and clean, and the staff are always very friendly. And of course BYOB!  One of our favorites.  Cash only!"}
{"text":"This food is delicious and I love that I can choose the spicyness ... the cash only policy is a big downside for me. Also a great place to go with vegetarian friends"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite Thai joints in Pittsburgh.  

The food is FANTASTIC 5/5!
There are so many dishes that are flavorful and savory. They really bring back the memories of my time in Southeast Asia.   If you're more adventerous i'd stay stray away from the more well known dishes like pad thai and try something authentic.  Top recommendations would have to be \"street noodle number 1\" and the  \"sukothai\".  The one fantastic thing about local restaurants is that the ingredients and taste almost always taste the same. They're smaller so they really put alot of care and interest in making their cuisine the same every time. 

oh yes, it's BYOB, another thing I love about Pittsburgh. 

Ambience 5/5
Absolute LOVE the ambience and decor.  It's incredibly chic and modern, but not overly pretentious.  It has that hipster feel to it (Lol Sorry didn't know how else to describe it).  It's designed to handle some big parties, small parties or if you'd just like to dine by yourself.  It's family friendly but most of the time it's usually mid-20s that I see go there.  

Service 3.5/5
Staff is nice, but don't expect fine dining service. They don't have a phone, so you have to go there to be able to order. I get that it's a part of the whole \"street style\" and \"hawkers\" theme, but I must say, it's a little bit inconvenient sometimes.



Oh yes, and the portions are very generous for the price that they charge.  Ranging from $6-$13 I believe.  Can't beat that for quality food and service!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Noodlehead maybe 3 times. The last time was with a group of friends for Sunday lunch and we brought a bottle of wine. My meal was ok, but not great. I ordered the See Yew noodles with chicken with a spice level of 2. What was brought to feel felt like a spice level of 5. There wasn't much veggies or bok choy in the noodles which I was bummed about. Also ordered the pork buns. They looked very boring when they were brought out. They weren't dressed up with anything, not even a few sprinkles of arugula sprouts or sliced cucumbers like I saw in some of the photos posted on yelp. Wasn't really excited about eating them and when I tasted them, the excitement meter didn't budge. Again, they were fine. I vaguely remember they were kind of sweet, but certainly not memorable. The prices are very reasonable and I like decor. I'll give it some time before returning again."}
{"text":"secret spicy level #6 + pepper powder = 6 stars. all that needs said. :::thumbsup:::

kee mao me."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have had in Pittsburgh. Just simple, straight-forward Thai street food: spicy noodles. Very well done - especially their rice noodles. Bummer about cash only, but totally understand."}
{"text":"Great food ! Don't like the \"all your party\" has to be hear or you can't have your table and the \"we are about to give It away!\" To be fair It does says this on their website.... so just know this is the case. Even after we said two of our party cancelled they were not going to let us sit. But I would go back!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to in Pittsburgh. It's super affordable and delicious! I ordered the See Yew and the rice noodles were perfectly cooked, the chicken wasn't dry, and the broccoli was perfectly bite-sized.  Oh, and it wasn't too salty (why are noodle dishes always too salty?!?). Also, the 5-point spicy scale seems to be exactly what it says it is. I asked for a Medium spice level (3) and it was slightly more than a kick, pleasantly surprising. 

The restaurant wasn't too crowded (it was a Monday night) and our party of 5 had plenty of room around us to feel like we had our privacy.  The only bad thing I could say was that the restaurant has dim lighting so the picture of my See Yew didn't turn out nicely. *crymyselfariver*"}
{"text":"Great food great value, only downside is the seating is limited but you can't fault a great place for being packed.

Make sure to BYOB"}
{"text":"I came here on my birthday back in March. I truly liked this place, very good high quality food, but there are some serious things people need to be aware of. The heat scale is totally messed up! You choose your spiciness on the dishes you order - and they do tell you that things can get pretty spicy but when your scale is from 1 to 5 and a 2 is already insanely hot I cannot even imagine what a 5 would be. My husband and I are not sensitive to heat either. A 5 has to be completely inedible - like that idiot you know at a chili potluck who just wants to make the most spicy stupid volcano chili that no one can eat. I want to come back to this place because it was really good and modern and prices were good, but I will take my spice a level down for sure."}
{"text":"Great Thai, cash only so bring your green. BYOB too. 
Priced right and oh so delicious. 
The pork steam buns are tiny warm pieces of porky perfection. 
*Order them. Order them now.

Cool staff, cool room. Totally chill environment. 

Get the Chang Mai curry, it is amazing, and the shrimp pad Thai is very flavorful. Have tried almost everything on the menu and nothing to complain about.
*but don't wear white, it's splashy 

Legit."}
{"text":"Delicious. I had the see yew with chicken. Cash only so be aware of that but for only $9 it was definitely worth the wait and the hype!"}
{"text":"service indifferent. Food was so greasy that my stomach was hurting shortly after we left.

We would liked to have eaten outside but a screaming infant who made a total mess under its chair was outside and it appeared that no other diners wanted to eat there for this reason other  UGH

I ordered a HOT  noodle dish and it barely had any heat to it....

The waitress brought out my entire order of soup and noodles all at once and my friends food later. It was ODD and not appropriate. soup always comes out FIRST.

I but into  some hard objects in the meat chunks in the soup......I showed this to the waitress and she acted very indifferent. My veneer was cracked.

nothing we had was any good, service sucked and i dont trust the food since i hurt my tooth

nickys or smiling banana leaf is way better"}
{"text":"What a find!  This place was suggested by a friend and I am so glad that I tried it out.   The vibe is modern industrial, but it's very warm and cozy.  Some of the tables are unique and very interesting - overall, a very pleasant d√©cor.   

Here are some things to know...
- It's cash only - come prepared!   The place is very reasonably priced, with most dishes $9 or less, but still - good to know in advance.  
- The pork belly steamed buns are a must.   Tender and delicious - some of the best I have had.   
- Pay attention when the waiter describes the spice levels.   I ordered the Street Noodles #1 in a level 2 (out of 5 levels).  It was perfect - spicy and flavorful, without being firey burning hot.  I normally would have gone with a 3 or 4, but was forewarned that they are serious about their Thai spices here.  My companion (who had previously tried the level 2) wimped out with a level zero this time and loved it.   
- BYOB, with a super reasonable corkage fee of 50 cents per person.
- The place is busy every night of the week, so be prepared to wait.   No reservations. 
- There is no parking.  A lot of the nearby street spots are permit only, so be prepared to walk a bit.   And don't try parking down the street near the wine store - even though I went in and bought a bottle of wine first, they wouldn't let me walk out of the parking lot and leave my car there. 

My only real critique of the place is that almost ALL of their seating is stools.   Backless stools.  Oh how I despise this creation.   I almost knocked a star off, but since I got a banquet seat (merely by chance), I was feeling generous."}
{"text":"Fantastic food but cash only. Also ATM charged me $5.50 in fees. Would've been 5-star."}
{"text":"Noodlehead was great. It was cheap and the portions were good for the price. The staff was friendly and quick. Definitely the best thing about the restaurant is the spice levels of the food. It's a 1-5 rating system, I got a level 4 and it was truly spicy and delicious. One thing to note, the are cash only. They do have an ATM in the corner of the restaurant but unless you're a fan of paying a $2.50 fee then bring cash."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is absolutely delicious. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu, but my favorite is the steamed buns and Pad See Ew! It's a great environment, BYOB and the food comes out quick and tasty. I've been on a mission trying all the Thai food in Pittsburgh, and Noodlehead is RIGHT on par with Nicky's and Smiling Banana Leaf for me.

It's great for a group of friends to go on a Friday night after work before hitting up the bars!"}
{"text":"Delicious comfort Thai food.  Flavorful and warming!  We had pad Thai, street noodle number #2 and the Thai chicken appetizer which I would reorder in a heartbeat.  The staff was welcoming and helpful!"}
{"text":"I loved Noodlehead! Despite being crowded we got a table rather quickly and the staff was super friendly. It's BYOB so my friend and I brought a 6 pack and there is only a .50 recycling fee no corkage charge.

We got the pork belly steamed buns first and they were unbelievable! We only got 1 serving which comes with 2 dumplings but next time I have to get my own!! 

I had Street Noodles #1 and my friend had See Yew and both were amazing. The food comes quickly and it's very nice sized portions. 

This restaurant is CASH ONLY, important to remember that, as I am someone who typically never has cash and uses my card. I will definitely be going back to Noodlehead soon and I highly recommend checking it out if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"Really great BYOB place to get a huge plate of noodles. Their veggie pad thai is great. Cash only but there is an ATM on-site."}
{"text":"Really good food and great value for money. :-)
Comfort food has a new home! Only negative is they do not take reservations and you won't be seated unless your entire party is there - understandable if you're this busy."}
{"text":"While this is technically a review for Noodlehead, I'm going to preface by acknowledging that I stick to two plates here. 

Two things still uphold the quality of this review: 

1. I've eaten those same two plates multiple times per month since this place opened [and the consistency is amazing]
2. Two plates still covers 10-15% of the menu [it's a small menu]. 

And what are those two plates [you're no doubt exhausted from wondering]? They are the Pork-Belly Steamed Buns and the Chiang Mai. 

Should you try them? [Subjectively] Yes, yes, and also yes. 

One or the other would easily fall into my top five plates in the city. They'd probably both have a spot in my top ten. They are delicious in all the right ways. Great flavors, textures, perfect for now or to take home for later. 

In addition, Noodlehead has a great space. We're always comfortable. It's energetic when full and chill when less full [read: it's never empty]

In all honesty, the only downsides to Noodlehead are that it's cash only and they have no listed phone to call in an order. I \"get\" the decision behind both of those and neither would ever stop me from eating there, but they are minor inconveniences."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about Noodle head! This was my very first experience with Thai food and it will certainly not be my last. It has been a few months since I visited and since then I was able to try Nicky's Thai downtown which seems to be another popular spot to grab Thai food. 

I absolutely love the industrialized rustic atmosphere of this restaurant. I also love how they utilized space by adding bench style seating along the walls and by adding the larger tables with benches in the center space allow room for larger parties. 

Keep in mind* this is a cash only restaurant, but they do have an ATM inside for your use if you forget cash. Also, it's BYOB and there is no cork fee! 

My mom and I ordered the beef soup to start which was a really nice size bowl filled with beef and rice noodles. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai for my meal. This so was flavorful and not too spicy. It's nice that you are able to pick the level of spiciness you prefer. They give you a lot of food for a really great price! The service was also very good for how busy they were. I personally prefer Noodle head over Nicky's Thai and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was good.. cash only.. They won't seat you until your whole party arrives .. There's usually a long wait but is worth it.. Ice Cream place next door is also very nice :)"}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai place in Pittsburgh -- everything we've tried here has been awesome: the pork belly sliders, pad thai, chiang mai noodles,  sukothai, street noodles #1, and beef noodle soup. Their menu is small which is a good thing. It seems they are focused on consistently delivering a few dishes, instead of overwhelming the customer with too many options and mediocre food."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about coming here because I'm gluten free and there was no phone number for me to call but we walked by and I asked about their menu - turns out they have a lot of gluten free options and thy told me they're completely msg free too. Loved the pad ke Mao (drunken noodles) - it was made with the realllly big flat noodles! Haven't found those noodles elsewhere in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Beef soup is the way to go. Be prepared to wait for a table, but usually worth it. Table turn over is fast so you can't really linger if they're busy. The food is really great, especially for the price."}
{"text":"The pulled pork steam bun is recommended. It's sweet and tasty. Have one for one bite! Also we ordered some noodles like Street Noodle No. 2  and Kee Mao with Tofu and they are awesome."}
{"text":"Not bad. This place threw me off initially, wit the \"seat yourself\" sign. I was actually hunting for what I thought might be \"Typhoon.\" Said screw it, walked inside. The decor seems purposefully cobbled together with random items, sliding barn doors, barrels, but mixed in with glass and steel.

Food. Good. Only peeve about this is that I'm pescatarian, so I am pretty limited to eating stuff with tofu and/or shrimp. I wish they had more veggie options for appetizers. Since they don't do subs or removals, don't even bother thinking of asking about it. Easier on the kitchen taff, harder on you. But, i can roll with the minimalism.

Also, the spice levels. I asked initially is it \"American-style hot\" or \"Thai-Style hot.\" Think Thai-style plus \"Holy Crap.\" They go wild in the kitchen. I went for a 3 on the 5 scale and was on fire. I like the heat, but the cooks have to cool out with whatever they are doing in there. I now go for level 1 on the scale, then add hot sauce to taste. Even that was scary. I put a dime's worth of sauce on some Pad Thai, and that lit up the whole plate. I'm not an American wuss, but I was struggling. 

The staff service is OK, mostly friendly, but I think that when the traffic ramps up, you can see the stress on servers faces. Understandable, but a little distracting. 

I love the drink menus. Mexican Coke? For the win. 

All in all, not bad, but could use an extra \"something.\""}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I treated ourselves to a late lunch here last week and we had such a great time. I got the shrimp pad thai (spice level 4/5) and he got the street noodles #2 (3/5) and they were both equally amazing dishes. We also ordered the sweet potato triangles as an appetizer that came with this sweet/savory cucumber sauce that were perfection. It's BYOB, so we brought two bottles of good craft beer and just had a lovely afternoon. Our waitress was super nice and our food came out quickly. We were there at a weird time so it was not busy at all. I noticed a couple people coming in for take-out which I definitely plan on doing in the future."}
{"text":"Finally, a place that can keep up with those who want a spice level that will make them sweat. I ordered the green curry needles at the \"crazy hot@ spice level and they were delicious. Also ordered the steamed pork buns and they are so delicious. I don't live in this area or I would be back more often."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY!!!
The best thai food ever 

Ordered Sukothai, Street noodle#2, one more from menu : all of them were Fantastic.

10,000% recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious large portions. Fast service and excellent prices. I have been here multiple times and there was just one thing I didn't really care for (it didn't taste bad, I just personally didn't like it). Only annoying thing is that they are cash only. 

Wish they would open a second location!"}
{"text":"In terms of location - this is the old typhoon and/or kanok. But once you step inside - it's a total change - architecturally, it's a fine mixture of rustic and modern design. Very Casual environment.

The menu is limited but very reasonably priced. Some of the dishes are similar to Pusadee Garden but none the less amazingly good. We had the bun thingy along with the suko thai and the love boat. It reminded me of the great food I had in the streets of Bangkok.

Yet another highly recommended BYOB Thai restaurant in the burgh."}
{"text":"Love Noodlehead. The pork buns are the perfect starter. I usually get the see yew with tofu at a 3. Perfectly spicy and an all around awesome dish, especially for the price. The beef soup was also surprisingly flavorful for such a straight forward dish. BYOB with a 50 cent cork fee. Can't beat the quality of the food especially for the price. Be warned - cash only and they stick to the spice scale."}
{"text":"I never tire of this place. If you don't get the steamed pork buns you might as well go home. Best pad Thai in existence. Price is unbeatable. Atmosphere bomb."}
{"text":"Very good service , and very budget friendly menu without sacrificing taste and flavor. When you don't want to cook Noodlehead Pgh. My favorite dish is Street Noodle #1. The crunchy, breaded chicken over the Asian noodles is delicious. If your not a fan of spice, I would  recommend  a level one as far as spice level. My girlfriend loves the Pad Thai. In my opinion, the only down fall is the limited menu, but some may like not having to many choices."}
{"text":"Get the pork buns. Best we've ever had. We've been to Noodlehead many times and everything is always consistently great. We usually stick to the street noodles. Be warned that the 3 spice level is spicy! I enjoyed it (only because I was in the mood for spicy food) but my S.O. was happy with his 2 spice level. I do wish they would add some new noodle dishes to the menu."}
{"text":"Street Noodle #2 Hotter Than Thai Hot WILL ROCK YOUR WORLD Hot Foodie Enthusiasts.

It is a clean and welcoming environment, which can be loud.  While they would certainly do well if they offered a phone-in and take-out option, NOODLEHEAD DOES NOT HAVE A TELEPHONE!  So Pittsburghers, lace up your boots and go for a walk because it is soooo worth it!  (Tastes better in winter)"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge Thai food eater.  The fact that Noodlehead even turned my head is a pretty impressive feat.  Noodlehead is cash only, but it is totally worth it.

The atmosphere is modern and fun, but my friend and I did find this place to be very cold, temperature wise.  We ordered the Thai fried chicken ($6.50) to start, and it was delicious.  I wouldn't consider it a show-stopper, and I would probably try a different appetizer next time.  It was good, though.  I ordered the Street Noodles #2 ($9) for lunch, which was thin egg noodles, tempura shrimp, bok choy, cilantro.  I kept the spice mild because our server said the food was naturally more spicy than normal.  I would disagree with this, but there is a spicy sauce on the table for do your own spicy!  So it was not an issue.  The dish was delicious.  Plenty of shrimp and enough for lunch the next day!

Our service was great!  The only major drawback is that parking can be challenging."}
{"text":"Our first time at this very eclectic restaurant. The food was amazing and the prices were extremely reasonable.
We had the pork belly appetizer in a sweet roll as well as the sinfully delicious \"pig wings\"
The entrees were made to perfection, made mine with very little heat to my son and husband that went for medium hot. There was a little sweating going on.
Love this place, just wish we could have told the owner in person what a great establishment he has!"}
{"text":"The best Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh for me! Being a vegetarian finding good options is always a challenge but not here! The Pad Thai and Kee Mao with Tofu is absolutely delicious!

Noodlehead has a very nice atmosphere and the staff are very friendly. The service is also quick. The portions are large and it's really affordable."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to update my review. I just ate here today, I ordered the see yew noodles with chicken. My meal came and I immediately noticed the middle of the chicken was raw. I told my server that the meat was undercooked and he said he would let the kitchen know but he still made me pay for my meal which I couldn't eat. Horrible experience. They conveniently don't have a telephone or an email address on their website so I posted on their Facebook. I may not go back here if they continue to ignore my complaint."}
{"text":"Its okay i love the atmosphere and decoration. Service is very good butI hope they have more choices in the menu I would love to try different dishes each visit."}
{"text":"The pros: 
- fast service at lunch
- very casual (good mix of students, post-yoga diners, after-work diners, etc)
- BYOB
- food is awesome every time. I'm basically going down the menu ordering the next item down on every visit and I've yet to be disappointed. (If it's your first time, order the pork belly steam buns and one of the street noodles, see yew, or the curry. so, so good). 

The cons: 
- dinner service. They seem to get overwhelmed very easily. I can't really tell if there's any rhyme or reason to who waits on you or when. They don't seem to have sections. A couple waiters who don't know what's going on and a couple food runners who are working their butts off. You spend way too much time waiting for your bill when you'd think it'd be in their best interest to turn tables. This doesn't seem to be a problem at lunch, only dinner.
- not a lot of parking around there. but that's no surprise in Shadyside. 
- I don't care that they're cash only, but it does seem to concern some people so worth mentioning
- No phone number (or at least I haven't found one), so I can't order carry out in advance, which drives me nuts because I would do so probably twice a week. 
- sometimes the spice level is inconsistent visit to visit. I like moderately spice, so I usually order a 2, but sometimes I can hardly taste the spice and other times I'm dying. Not a big deal because the food is tasty either way."}
{"text":"Very good no frills Thai food. They we're quick and generous to remedy a mis-ordered dish. Good heat, and great curry flavor. Tempura shrimp were a bit oily, but otherwise everything else was really good."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday with a friend and we had to wait for 15-20 minutes, as we expected. The ambiance and decor isn't really my style, and the patrons were definitely not the kind I was expecting (aka it wasn't full of asians). It's a loud place, and seems to resonate with hip white yuppies especially with their cheap BYOB policy. The hostess brought us to our table with a pitcher of water she grabbed from a fridge, but I think it was in there for about 5 minutes because the place is busy and my friend and I sat there drinking some lukewarm tap water which sucked since we had to walk pretty far in some hot sticky weather.

For the starters, or \"snacks\" as they call them, just get the pork belly steamed buns. They are the highlight of this restaurant. ********THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF MY REVIEW SO I WILL SAY THIS AGAIN, IF YOU ARE SITTING IN THIS RESTAURANT AND HAVE SEARCHED THE REVIEWS HERE WITH THE KEYWORD SNACKS BECAUSE YOU ARE DECIDING WHICH ONE TO GET, GET THE PORK BELLY STEAMED BUNS. PORK BELLY STEAMED BUNS!!!!******** They're amazing, even if they just look like a white pacman pillow with some cucumbers and a lot of pork. You only get 2 for $6, and I would have rather just had it for my whole meal if it was like 4 for $10 or something, but $3 each for a whole meal is too steep. $2.50 each is steep too but whatever, they really are just that good. You can BYOB but they also have some non-alcoholic drinks that are rather expensive. My friend got a bottle of Mexican coke (which is made with cane sugar instead of blah blah whatever i don't remember it just tastes like coke) and it was $3 and really small, like 355 ml small.

For the actual noodle part of my meal, I got the pad thai because I love pad thai and this is a thai place. I usually like it with pork but this place only offers chicken, shrimp, and tofu so I picked chicken. It was honestly very underwhelming for a pad thai dish (I have had pad thai at many places around the world). The sauce was not very flavorful and the chicken was not exciting either. If there were peanuts or eggs in the dish I did not notice them. I'll get something different the next time I come here and stick to another location for pad thai. It was a huge dish, though. My friend got beef noodle soup which was pretty good. It's a simple dish with beef, noodles, and soup that was pretty good. The noodles are very thin noodles and the beef is yummy and tender and didn't have weird mystery bits. I could eat the portion for this in one sitting unlike the pad thai. We both got them at a 0 because we are babies who don't like spicy food, so maybe that would have made the pad thai better but food really should be acceptably delicious at a 0 if you're offering a scale.

If I came here alone, I would give this place 3 stars because it was loud, my dish was lame, but the pork belly buns were really, really, REALLY good. Since my friend's beef noodle soup was good I will give it 4 stars but I'll definitely get something different if I end up there again and leave the pad thai to other places around Pittsburgh.

~Dish Ratings~
Pork Belly Steamed Buns - 5/5
Pad Thai w/ Chicken - 2.5/5
Beef Noodle Soup 4/5"}
{"text":"I still love Nicky's and the Smiling Banana Leaf the most, but Noodlehead comes in next and quite close!  Despite having a more limited menu, it surely does not disappoint.  So much so that when we we've had it three times in the past two weeks. 

We have had the grilled beef app thing- yum.  And have tried the pad Thai, see eww and kee mao... everything is awesome.  Spicy even at a level 1, but great.  Their scale is 1-5, but even a 1 seems like a 3 or 4 to me.  

My only complaints are you cannot call to phone in an order and its cash only... I never carry cash anymore.  I think that they have an ATM on site now at least which helps with that."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch hours and it was packed! I got seated for 2 right when we walked in though. Great ambiance and in a great neighborhood. Huge portion for being under $10 each dish. 

1. Pad thai with shrimp with spciey level 2: Tons of shrimps, however I was questioning if they're frozen since they're small and had no flavour. Usually my paid Thai comes with fresh shrimp with the tail still on it, less shrimps but bigger shrimps. The noodles was all cut up which I don't like. You're suppose to have long noodlds for prosperity! Spicey level 2 was fine for me who can't handle spcieiness at all, just the right amount of kick. They did have the flavour after I added the lime juice to it. It was okay for a fast food kind of pad Thai but I've had better. 

2. Pad kee mao with tofu and spicy level 5: Bf had this and rated it 2 stars. Had a bit of flavour but he said he had better. Said it wasn't spicey at all but he has a high tolerance. Tofu was cubes and didn't have much flavour, very bland. Had better food (in Thailand) 

Overall, great spot for a fast food style Thai food at a reasonable price (under $10 each dish) and huge portion, you'll be full!"}
{"text":"My, my, my - $9 noodle plates AND BYOB? There's not much more that would keep this girl happy...
I prefer a small menu, and the owners of Noodlehead are definitely all about keeping things simple.  importantly, there's no reservation list;  I realized this after scouring the internet to find a contact number...and came up with nothing. However, as it's a relatively new restaurant, and still a well kept secret, I was able to get a table for 3 with only a 20 minute wait.  
We tried the Kee Mao and the Pad Thai.  This is one of the few Thai restaurants that stays true to their spice scale- a \"medium hot\" spicy level would be the equivalent to a \"level 10\" spice elsewhere, so to all of you spice lovers: scale back and order accordingly!
I'll definitely be back to try more from their menu!"}
{"text":"Noodlehead is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I can't eat Pork Buns or Kee Mao anywhere else. 

The service is quick - I've never had to wait more than 15 min even when it's busy. It is cash only, which can be a bit of a pain, but there is an ATM in the back. The rustic decor is amazing and the outdoor seating can be busy, but is pet friendly!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and good service, but the food is really just terrible.  Come here if you want to hang out with friends and have fun, but don't com here looking for tasty food because you won't find it.  The street noodles and pad thai are simply gross."}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday of my life! Just writing this review has my mouth watering! Bring cash! CASH ONLY! Also byob, so bring yo booze, baby! Love the curry! The dried noodles on top are so amazing...ok I gotta go to noodlehead!"}
{"text":"I eat here fairly often, because I enjoy spicy Thai noodles, and I almost always order the See Yew with tofu, which is delicious. What I feel sets this place apart is that I can freely ask for \"no fish sauce\" (since I am a vegetarian), and they happily accommodate. I understand that there are probably more authentic Thai places out there, but not all of them are so understanding of my desire not to consume fish products.

I also like that it's BYOB, and I don't mind the cash-only rule. Every time I've gone, they've been super chill about splitting the bill.

A couple downsides (that keep it from getting 5 stars):

1. They don't allow for call-aheads or reservations and it can get pretty busy. I hate waiting (sometimes the wait is over an hour) so I only eat here for a late lunch (like 2ish).

2. The spice level is somewhat inconsistent. I tried every spice level up to 4 before finally deciding on 3. Some days that 3 tastes more like a 2, and others more like a 4 or 4.5! Just a heads up so you don't accidentally order something too spicy to eat."}
{"text":"Best pad thai in Pittsburgh. Usually crowded and slightly uncomfortable seating, but the food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I had the chicken pad thai, level zero heat, and the lemongrass iced tea. The pad thai could've used a little more lime, but overall had a lot of flavor. I couldn't taste the lemongrass in the tea, but it was also decent.

Ambiance gets an A. It's a bit dimly lit and noisy, but there are people who look for that in an evening outing. The menu's a bit limited, but if you're looking for good noodles, you'll be satisfied."}
{"text":"This place is so ridiculously tasty. We've been here several times with our one-year old son and we all love the food. Service is quick, and every noodle dish we've tried have been so yum. Like, I could eat here every day. The steamed pork buns are our favorite appetizers, and my toddler gobbles them down. They are kid friendly. This place is always busy, but I can see why. It's also so cheap! It's definitely one of our favorites here in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I live a few blocks away and couldn't be happier. For entrees, See yews, pad thai and chiang mai are my go-to's. Steamed buns are also always ordered. Spicy level 3 for me! Consistent and delicious."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced and delicious food in a cozy atmosphere. Service was prompt and courteous. I had the vegetarian Kee Maw at level 4 spiciness and it was flavorful with just the right amount of heat. Will definitely go there again soon!"}
{"text":"If I had to pick one place in Pittsburgh to eat for a whole year, I might just pick Noodlehead! I've been here several times with friends, and each time I've always enjoyed my eating experience. All the foods I've tried, including the Pad See Ew and Street Noodle 2, have been super tasty. One thing to note is spice levels as they may vary between dishes with recipes that already have lots of spices and those that don't. They also have takeout, which might come in handy for packing a quick meal for the next day when school gets busy. Highly recommend this place for some quality food!!"}
{"text":"Bobby decided to give Thai one more try after a fail at a different Thai place (which was his first Thai experience) Noodlehead has been bookmarked for months , so we (I) decided on here, lol.

Love the decor, super cool. I do want to point out that it was pretty loud in here. Keep that in mind if this is a first date, lol.

First, we ordered 2 orders of spring rolls (2/ order, $3.50). They were a great app and i loved the sauce. 

For dinner, bobby ordered street noodles #1 (chicken) & I ordered street noodles #2 (shrimp). I had mine at a spice level of 2/5 & my bf chose 4/5. We enjoyed out noodles. The portion size was perfect. I'm a weakling and enjoyed my 2 spice level. My bfs was a 4 and I tried some. Still bearable even for me (of course, i only had two bites. Doubt I could finish a whole plate of 4 spice level). The sauce was great- tangy yet also sweet.

For drinks, I stuck with water that they bring to the table.. although I asked for ice Bc it wasn't cold and no ice was offered initially. My bf stick went with a coke (glass bottle) . they are BYOB so next time we will bring some wine :)

We really enjoyed Noodlehead. I look forward to trying their Chiang Mai curry dish, which is also popular. Another joint in the burg is still my #1 Thai place but I do believe noodlehead is solid 4 stars. 

**Cash Only. - ATM on site."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Thai food since I moved here to Pittsburgh. The servers were attentive, no lines (came in on Saturday at noon) - I ordered Spring rolls, Shrimp See Yew (medium spicy), and ordered hot tea. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Really very very good !!!!
I'll come back again.
Came here for an early summer dinner. With some of the other reviews indicating that the place usually gets busy for dinner service, I was surprised to walk in and see only a few other parties inside (and one party at one of the two outside tables).

Service was really fast and friendly from the moment I walked in the door. For $12 and change, I got their Street Noodle #1 and a glass of lemongrass and honey iced tea. For a quite warm afternoon, the tea is refreshing with just the right amount of honey to not overpower the delicate citrus taste from the lemongrass. Street Noodle #1 is rice noodles and baby boc choy in a chili, fish sauce, and cilantro sauce, all topped with a crispy thai fried chicken cutlet. The sauce was especially tasty and in true Thai cuisine, the spices didn't only contribute heat, but a significant amount of flavor. This time I only got it medium spiciness (level 2 on a scale of 0-5), but next time, I'll definitely go up a notch or two. Also what was surprising is that the sauce tasted like it contains palm sugar, a more richer sweetness than plain sugar. The Thai Fried Chicken was juicy, while preserving a light and crunchy battered crust. The chicken alone is something worth coming to this place for for, even with their stand-out noodles."}
{"text":"My first impressions weren't great but the food was good. The restaurant has a steel-and-wood look more suited to a bar, and floors were sticky - a huge turn-off for me. We were seated quickly at a large rectangular wood table with long benches for seats. Our waitress was hurried but nice. I had a taste for iced tea but they don't serve standard black tea so I skipped the drink and had only water. The kee mao was delicious but I didn't care for the overly sweet see ew. My kids have more of a sweet tooth and enjoyed it. Be warned about the spice level you ask for though. I've eaten spicy foods in Indonesia and Thailand that will burn your tastebuds off, and the heat levels here are authentic. I don't recommend exceeding their mildest level."}
{"text":"Noodle head is hands down, the BEST place for Thai style noodles in Pittsburgh. Everything comes out hot and tastes fresh. All of the he ingredients in each dish that I've tried compliment each other very well which makes for a delicious meal. A few things to be aware of though are that the restaurant is cash only, you cannot call in an order ahead of time as they do not have a phone, and the spicy levels are spicer than other Thai restaurants that I have been to."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in for dinner and had a wonderful experience. I loved how it's BYOB and drank some of the wine we brought from home. We shared the pulled pork belly buns and they had the perfect ratio of fat to pork belly. The picked cucumbers provided a fresh element to the dish. I ordered Street Noodle #1 for my main entree. The crispy chicken was absolutely delicious and were the perfect vehicle to dip in the noodle sauce. The slight sweetness of the sauce did not overwhelm the dish. 

I would have given all 5 stars had it not been for our waiter. He took awhile to get to our table to get our orders and also took awhile to ask if we liked our food. 

Other than the waiter not being attentive, the food and ambience of the place will definitely make me go back again."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is the only restaurant I've ever eaten in where I can say that I've tried almost every item on the menu!  Each item was prepared quite well and tasted amazing!  The spice levels are perfect (I usually take a 4, by the way).  I love that they aren't pretentious.  The only criticism is that the food is so good, it gets busy sometimes.  And that isn't a bad thing at all!!  

The price/portion ration is great; for a very reasonable price, you will get enough food to fill you up.  You won't be over-stuffed but won't be hungry at all either.  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food. But seriously, no phone to call in take-out orders? C'mon now. It's bad enough that they are cash only. But seriously, the food is worth every annoyance. Five stars for food, one star for customer-friendliness."}
{"text":"BYOB? No worries, they serve Mexican Coke!
I, following the tutelage of fellow Yelpers, had the Street Noodles 1 and the Steam Pork Dumplings.  WOW! The Dumplings were sweet and tangy. This mixed with the Spicy yet fresh tasting Street Noodles made for a delectable lunch. Pusadee's Garden has met it's match for my Tai Short List in the Burgh."}
{"text":"Great food and service, but the cash only policy makes it a pain when you forget, then have to go get cash and come back. Lame on their part. So, for that they lose a star."}
{"text":"The food was good but the staff was rude. There were a number of people waiting to eat and they kept telling us to move because we were in the way but as soon as we moved they told us again (this happened 3 times). They were also rude to a woman in a wheelchair who was waiting despite her attempt to also make enough room for people to walk by. The stools to wait have a seat that screws off and one fell apart for another customer as they were getting up so thankfully they did not fall over. Also only one of the two female toilets was functioning."}
{"text":"Ok this is officially my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh now. We went at around 7 and there was a long line already. It moved pretty fast though. I got street noodle #2, the one with tempura shrimps and asked for medium spiciness. Everything tasted amazing! The pork belly buns were literally the BEST buns I'd ever had. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Noodlehead has surprisingly well planned ambiance; I really love the layout and the sort-of (fancy) barn accents. The tables are well placed and spaced. I also appreciate their simple, no nonsense menu. But with so few vegetarian options, I am not likely to dine here over, say, Thai Cuisine. The dishes I've tried have been fine, but it'd be nice to be able to order an appetizer to go with my meal. They also have no trouble turning up the spice here, beware! My partner could hardly eat his spice level \"3\" dish that seemed to be ruined for him with overdone heat. I think they just add chili sauce or paste to increase the heat, not fresh peppers or anything delicious like that. So it's probably best to aim low with your requested level, then ask for chili sauce to add yourself."}
{"text":"I was super sad when my neighborhood Thai spot, Kanok, closed its doors. I hadn't been able to get over to Noodlehead after moving, but now that I have...I'm actually mad that such an amazing place opened after I left Highland!

I went with a group and tried a good number of dishes. The menu is small, but it allows them to execute everything to perfection. It was obvious that their noodles were homemade. If they're not, then I want to know where they are getting noodles of this caliber of freshness from, because they're amazing. All my friends' $9 dishes were tasty with large portions--the Pad Thai, See Ew, Chang Mai Curry, and Street Noodle #2. Basically, you can't go wrong with anything here.

I went with one of the $6 \"snack\" noodles, the Sukothai, and it was easily my favorite. I find most soups to be boring, but their spicy lime broth was rich with deep flavors. Spice level 4 seemed tame at first, but as I ate more of the soup it developed a slow burn that got my nose running. Along with the noodles, it was packed with deliciously seasoned ground pork, chopped green beans, bean sprouts, and a hardboiled egg. The pork belly steamed buns are also a must have. One bun and a \"snack\" noodle filled me up, though I wasn't starving since I had a chai next door at Oh Yeah while we waited to get in here.

There were some not-so-good things:
1. We were quoted a 20-30 minute wait, and ended up having to wait a little over an hour for a table.
2. Our waitress was kind of snobby and totally unhelpful. I asked which of two dishes she preferred and she wouldn't give me a suggestion because \"they're not similar at all\" (well duh, I read the ingredients). She also gave us a weird lecture about pork belly as if we didn't know what it was or something. It was really busy though, so I'll give her bitchiness the benefit of the doubt...
3. Cash only doesn't vibe with the trendy atmosphere here at all.
4. No desserts, also kind of strange. Even just one dessert and one sorbet would be good.

The not-so-good things were pretty minor though and outweighed by the outstanding food, and the fact that I'm already craving more Sukothai noodle soup two days after eating here...I can't give it any less than a perfect score!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive. Delicious. Highly recommended I truly felt the food is Thailand quality!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to grab a bottle of wine and get a good meal. The prices are great, and it's always a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Man, it's been a minute since I've been here! My coworkers and I used to come here ALL THE TIME, but over the past 2-3 years we have all moved on to different jobs that are out of the area so it is a lot more difficult to get everyone together at the same time.

Ok enough ranting.. let's talk about the service. It could be better. Sometimes you feel like a bother, some times they just put your food down and walk away, and sometimes you get a pleasant hostess/wait staff. Tonight, my friend and I had a great experience. The hostess was kind and our waitress was super friendly without being overbearing.

I always save the best for last.. THE FOOD. There is a reason why the line is out the door on a Monday night.  As a matter of fact, while I was waiting to be seated, a gentleman walked by and said, \"it's a hopping joint!\" This place serves good food at an affordable price. I don't think there is anything on the menu that I haven't had, but I always find myself debating between the Chang mai curry and the pad see ew. Both are very different from each other, but are very tasty and filling. As far as the appetizers go.. get the steam buns. Hands down. They are heavenly!  

Three important tips to remember.. 1. It's BYOB. - hook, line, sinker! Sign me up any day or should I say, everyday.
2. If you have booze, you can't sit outside. Rules are rules.
3. It's cash only - they do have an ATM in the back, but I'm not sure of what the fee is to use it. 

Overall, I highly recommend. I bet if they did pineapple fried rice they would even give Thai me up a run for their money."}
{"text":"The food at Noodlehead is very tasty for the price.  The atmosphere is very casual and pleasant.  It is a BYOB restaurant which is always good.  The only negatives about Noodlehead is that they are a cash - only restaurant which is kind-of annoying, and also that they do not have a good selection of vegetarian food.  There are no vegetarian appetizers or sides and only 2 entrees that you can choose on a vegetarian diet.  Other than this it is an excellent meal at a good price."}
{"text":"Why do people like BYOB? That's like saying here you do our job for us. 

Saw the great reviews figured I'd give it a try. I love asian fusion places and this thai inspired place looked great. Plus it was right next to Oh Yeah Ice cream, and you know I love my ice cream.

So we walked in waited for a couple minutes and realized there was no hostess. I saw the sign that said cash only and had to leave to hit up the ATM! It's the 21st century! Time to upgrade and get a credit card reader. When I came back in we were seated immediately only to find out i was going to sit on a tiny wooden stool for up to an hour while my friend got to sit on a comfy couch? I get theres an ambiance and eclectic design they were trying to have but jeez, at least give me the option of a more comfortable chair while I dine.

The 2 waiters over there looked swamped. They need busboys/ hostesses. It's ridiculous to have 2 waiters do all that work especially for dinner. The menu as indicated was very short which isn't a problem but when all the option look the same and just variations of the other ones there really isn't much to eat. I got the pork buns which were great. Soft and savory with a slight hint of sweet. I also got the soup which was very good as well. I liked the hot and spicy effects with the cool broth and delicious chips on the side. 

For the main course my friend got sew yew which looked nothing like the description but it was basically beef chow fun. Tasty but a little too much pepper if you ask me. I got street noodles #1 at a hot level of 3 and the guy warned me that that was very very hot. I obliged saying I could take the heat. When our meal came out I was immediately turned off just by the smell. It smelled like old leather boots and when you bit into the noodles they tasted of nasty rank vegetables. They needed soy sauce or sweet sauce to calm the food down.  Now I can eat anything. You can ask my friends but I eat everything under the sun. This is the first dish ever that I simply had to push away and could not eat. I told the waiter it was bad and his response was \"well other people eat it\" asked if I would like anything else but I simply could not eat anything else. Even when he removed the dish the smell lingered and I was grossed out. 

The waiter came back cleaned off our dishes and let us sit there for another 10 minutes. Why didn't he just bring us the check? When he did return he did not charge me for my meal which i did not eat. I put my money down and we sat for another 10 minutes. I waited for my date to use the bathroom and she said someone had left a green mess in the toilet that no one cleaned which grossed me even more out. 

I will not be returning. The service is too slow, cash only and BYOB is BS, no parking (plus the bridge is out) and the food was marginal with that one dish being simply disgusting."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars because even though everything I've tried on the menu is absolutely delicious, it's pretty limited and they haven't been changing it up or adding new flavours (at least not since the last time I checked). The pork steamed buns are probably one of the best I've ever had, the pad see yew is great too! Their street noodles are good but personally I prefer the pad see ew more - really hits the spot when you want Thai noodles. Their other starters like the fried chicken and the wings are all right also but the pork buns are a MUST!

Cash only but there's an ATM inside and you can't make reservations which can be a pain."}
{"text":"This place's food is quite a unique twist on the typical Thai stuff that one finds at more traditional Thai restaurants. First off, the pulled pork belly steamed buns definitely live up to their reputation; while a tad expensive at $3 a piece, they are so worth it! The buns are soft, while the filling is extremely tasty and tender. That itself blew us away, even before the entrees.

Friend and I ordered two different noodles, the Street Noodle #1 and the See Yew. The Street Noodle is a rice noodle, and they do it differently from most other places (mostly Chinese) that I've eaten at. It's somewhat fried but not completely; in any case, it's very tasty, but I would recommend getting this dish just for the fried chicken. Its skin is crispy and the meat inside isn't dry at all, which was a bit surprising.

The See Yew is more of your traditional Thai type of noodle, which is wide and flat (like pad thai). The chicken that this one came with was not as interesting as the other one, but this dish as a whole was still very good nonetheless."}
{"text":"Best Thai place in the whole city by far. I got their chicken and it tasted so good as well as the noodles themselves and the vegetables. Really great vibe here too and the prices for the eats were affordable! It's great they have a smaller menu because they really do a great job making them. Staff was highly friendly as well and did a good job guiding me to make a good order. Foods spicy and I loved it"}
{"text":"Number 1 street noodle hype!
I've been here lots of times and felt like? it was finally time to leave a review
I love this place and flavours are amazing. Obviously, I have a favourite dish. You should try it. It's quite good.
Cash only, everything is affordable. It gets quite busy in peak hours. No reservations, you get there and wait until you're served.

Spice level is 1-5. 1 is actually a perfect spice level for most people. 2 is for those that like to live a little. Keep the water handy. 3 an above is for people who like their tongues burned. If you're on a date, here is not the place to show your spice tolerance off.

It's a good 2nd to 4th date spot. Not as safe as you'd play it on the first date as it's more esoteric and the atmosphere is a bit more off the wall unique, but it's good for lowkey impressing someone with your taste. Also good to go to with friends.
One thing that I think is understated in the yelp reviews is that noodlehead is actually pretty convenient for pickup and takeout. Just get to the location, go up to the cashier, tell her what you want, wait a little bit, get noodles. It's a little slower than going to chipotle but well...you're not getting food from chipotle. More than once, I've been in and out with sit down restaurant quality food with fast food joint wait times.

In short. Eat noodles. Mouthgasm. Get hype."}
{"text":"I come here all the time- the food is amazing and flavorful (even if you don't like spice, you can opt for zero spice or just a little). Large portions for a great price especially if you're of the college age. Word to the wise though - it's cash only, dinner time you will always wait, and you need to have the whole party with you when you are seated. I promise it's worth it though"}
{"text":"My best friend in Pittsburgh took me here the other night, and I gotta say it's probably my fav. place to eat in the Steel City.

I has the Se Yew, which was yummy and paired with fresh veggies. The bok choy was spot-on and the broccoli was fresh/delish. But what really shined here was the pork buns. The fluffy, soft, sweet bins were filled with delicious pulled bacon and cucumbers. I could easily eat 10 of them.

It's a cash-only joint, so make sure to bring some dolla bills."}
{"text":"Love noodlehead! We always get takeout so I can't rate the service that much but for the price, you get great food and healthy servings. I don't particularly like how they don't take credit cards since I don't carry cash but I understand the reasoning and I either go there with cash or I go somewhere else. But, they're definitely one of the best places for Thai."}
{"text":"Big, big fan of Noodlehead.

First off, the decor and atmosphere is very modern and trendy. Definitely loved it. It looks like it was made for the nightlife scene, which made it weird that they don't have a bar or even bottles, but it is BYOB.

The parking is street only, which may be tough in that location, but we didn't have too much trouble finding some free spots in nearby neighborhood streets.

The food was great. We started off with the pork belly bao appetizer. These were delicious. They were a little small, and the dough was a little too chewy, but besides that, it was the baomb. I had the Chiang Mai curry, which reminds me a lot of a Thai dish called \"Khao Soi\" (or are they one in the same?). Basically it's a chicken curry stew with noodles, but also topped with crispy noodles for texture. This was REALLY FREAKING GOOD, and pretty filling as well. The S/O had the Street Noodle 2, which is tempura shrimp over thin egg noodles in a sweet/sour/spicy sauce. She liked my dish more, but I thought hers was delicious... only it was a much smaller portion than mine.

The spice levels are from 1-4 or 5 I think. I went with 2 for Medium, and I thought it was just right for that little kick but not too much to take away from the flavor."}
{"text":"Long wait on a Sunday night folks. But guess what it's worth it. You can't go wrong with any noodle you pick! 
Hey once you go past a 2 on spice you're on your own if you aren't a spicy person... the staff is so nice but it's pretty fast pace here. 
Make sure to bring cash and that who ever you're eating with is there or else you won't be seated! 
Every thing has so much flavor and it's served to you hot! Nothing comes cold! 
The sweet potato taste like something from thanksgiving but wrapping in Thai culture it's so awesome! The spring rolls are to die for... the noodles are great like you can't go wrong but the chicken is a solid choice and the tofu is cooked fully unless you want it other wise, for the vegans that like their tofu a little tough... 
this place is great stop by it's worth the wait if you don't want to do something while you wait go next door to try some amazing ice cream!"}
{"text":"Such a cute BYOB place. It's cash only, but the prices are so good to your pocket. We just moved here and saw this on Yelp, so stopped in for a late dinner. The waitresses were really sweet and the menu was nice and simple. We got the street food #1 (fried chicken over noodles) and curry noodles. The coconut milk in the curry was so good. I wish the noodles could soak it all up. The noodles were perfectly al dente for me."}
{"text":"I was eating out so much lately that I just can't have any more of the oily, fatty, crappy food prepared with a \"I hate my job and life attitude\" they give you in lots of the places. Noodlehead does not have a lot of variety but what they have is freaking delicious. We had the pork buns and even though I am usually not a big fan of pork buns, I couldn't get enough of the ones here. The texture and the flavor combinations is absolutely divine. As a main I had the Chiang Mai Curry and boy was it good. Again, perfect texture, enough chicken, taste was incredible and I couldn't stop eating. You choose between a spice level of 1 -5 . I had 1 and that was more than enough for me (I cannot handle spice well though). If you can't finish the portion, ask for a takeaway box.

Staff was patient with us, quick and super friendly. Nice outdoor seating is available as well. They definitely have found a new regular customer!"}
{"text":"Love the food! Simple, fast and always so tasty! Pork steamed buns are incredible, but the noodles are so filling I would recommend to go easy on apps! The only suggestion I have for noodlehead is to try to be more consistent with the spice levels. My boyfriend and I always go for #5 and it tastes less and less spicy... But we will be back for sure! Again and again..."}
{"text":"I live pretty close to this restaurant, and it's my go-to lunch place when I don't want to cook on the weekends. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice, and the prices are very reasonable. At $9 for each huge plate of food, it's a steal.

The noodles and the appetizers are amazing. My favorites are the Chicken Kee Mao, the See Yew noodles, and the pork buns. They are the best items on the menu. The Chicken Pad Thai is a very safe and delicious option as well.

The service isn't great. They tend to forget to bring more water and take a long time to seat you, bring you the food, and take your order. One of the waitresses won't wait more than ten seconds for you to decide what you want to order -- she'll just tell you to take your time to decide and comes back ten minutes later. But given the nice ambiance and the fact that I'm only paying $9, I can take it.

If you're planning on coming here, remember to bring your wallet! This place is cash only."}
{"text":"We're in love with Noodlehead. The price is right, portions are perfect, and the food is fresh and consistent. We've had nearly every dish on their slightly small menu - you really can't go wrong. 

Warning for groups: it is difficult to snag a table for 3+ people after 7pm on the weekends. While there's always a wait for groups in the evenings, couples don't seem to have to wait long (if at all) getting a table for two. 

As most have mentioned, the spice level is much more intense than your average Pittsburgh Thai place. We order on the low end (2) then add their chili sauce to kick it up if necessary.

Service is great. Cash only. You can get take out, but have to order there and wait for it (no phone number). 

Our opinion, a nice IPA is a perfect compliment to their menu. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This little BYOB gem in Shadyside is awesome.  The food is reasonably priced and delicious.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Loved the ambience and the environment. We were 4 in a group, ordered 4 varieties of noodles, and everyone was very satisfied with their dish. I ordered the street noodles 1, was a bit more spicy than I expected (at level 4, their ratings are on 5), but the thai style chicken in the noodles tasted delicious. A new favorite is the kee mao, excellent flat noodles, basil and bok choy. Another tasty dish is the chiang mai curry.
Overall I loved it, its good for the cost, would go there again!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food super spicy though I ordered the curry noodles at a level 3 and I literally could not eat it it was that painful. Also the service was awful the servers made me feel bad for asking questions. I would not recommend this place nor come back"}
{"text":"The restaurant lived up to the hype. I'd highly recommend coming and expecting a wait. The atmosphere is relaxed with wood planked walls and a barn door. 

The server was really social and willing to give her recommendations. I took her advice and ordered the Chang Mai and fried spring rolls. The spring rolls were had a flakes wrapper and delicious filling. It comes with duck sauce. The Chang Mai had rice noodles in a tasty yellow curry, topped with what appeared to be fried noodles. I took the server's advice and went with the level 2 heat. I like spicy food and that was a good level of heat.

For tables of 5 or more, an 18% gratuity is included but my server deserved it."}
{"text":"I'm not so impressed first time when I was here especially considering that I waited almost one hour. But now I've been Noodlehead's loyalist since the kee mao and beef soup are so damn great. I have to say they're much better than some places where I ate in Thailand."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time last night. I have been wanting to try this restaurant out for quite some time now, but the fact that I never carry cash with me doesn't make this a spontaneous spot for me when I am out and about. The food is good, cheap, and makes for a fantastic date night."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times, and my experience has been pretty variable. The food isn't out-of-this-world - for really good thai, try Smiling Banana Leaf - but the dishes are tasty and satisfying, especially for the price tag. They're not afraid to really up the heat level, which I appreciate. I also love that there are individual bottles of water at each table so that you don't have to constantly bug your server to re-fill your glass. And BYO is always an excellent option. When it's a weekday and not too crowded, I love this place.

On the weekends, it's a whole different beast. They are really not equipped to handle large crowds in the evenings. They don't have a dedicated hostess, and the owner, who frequently assumes this role when he is there, is just not able to give people estimates of how long their waits will be. He's borderline rude about it when people ask. And when you're really hungry and considering a number of restaurants, that's not cool. They also don't take reservations, credit cards, or do take-out (!). They don't even have a phone, apparently, so you can't ask them to call you so you can spend your wait for a table enjoying a drink at at Mad Mex. I appreciate the appeal of a stripped-down approach to a restaurant, but it can make things really inconvenient for the consumer. 

So, in short: weekdays, go! On weekend evenings...approach with caution."}
{"text":"It's not a bad place to stop in and feed your craving for Thai noodles. I had the see yew. I'd say it was good and I'd be fine having it again. My only knock is not having condiments to add spice. They need sriracha on the table or some peppers in a jar. Others in my group has the pad Thai and the curry linguine and they were satisfied."}
{"text":"The only downfall is cash only, but they do have an ATM in there for convenience. We tried this after just moving to Pittsburgh and it did NOT disappoint! Amazing spring rolls and the pork belly was like eating a cloud - it was SO delicious!

We got the Pad See Ew and the Pad Thai and it was delicious. Would definitely go back and order again and again!

**update: tried more dishes. The Love Boat was great! ...and the Chiang Mai Curry - OMGGGGGGG!"}
{"text":"Noodlehead was a VERY delicious Thai restaurant! First off, it's CASH ONLY but they have an ATM in the restaurant. They are also BYOB. I came here with my friends and we all had a fabulous time. They do not take reservations and will only seat you when the entire party is present. We came here on a Thursday night and it was very busy, but we had a group of 8 and were seated at the back of the restaurant within 5 minutes because the large table was available for larger parties. My friends have all been here and some of them get Noodlehead once a week! I decided to finally try it and the food was delicious! I eat a lot, but the portion size was large and more than fair for the price. Because I knew the portion size was large, I had Pad See Yew with tofu and I split it with my friend. We ordered a spice level of 4 out of 5, but I actually had to add more sriracha (I love very spicy food)... I recommend that if you are sensitive to spice, you order less of a spice level because you can always add spice but not take it away. My friends and I also ordered the Cold Lemongrass Honey Iced Tea, which is only $2.50 and came with free refills. I highly recommend you get the tea... it was one of the best teas I have ever drank (not too sweet but flavorful and delicious). The service was a bit slow and the waiter was not the most attentive, but the restaurant was busy and the food made up for it. If you don't have time to wait, I suggest ordering takeout!"}
{"text":"Every city in the country needs a place like this - cheap, fast, great ambiance and extraordinarily delicious! Its like providing the authentic hole-in-the-wall food experience without being a hole-in-the-wall. We got the pork buns which came out way too fast - probably 2 mins after we placed our order and could have been warmer and/or fresher but it was all uphill from there. The sukothai and chang mai noodles were the right amount of spicy for us (3) and had so many amazing flavors! We loved this place.

Downside is they don't take credit cards but nothing should deter you from going here and trying it at least once and probably more!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in town! But beware: I am not the only one who thinks so. It can get really, really busy and they don't have a phone to call and reserve seating. It is also BYOB and cash only. These frustrating aspects do not dampen the experience though!

The menu has been the same for as long as I can remember. Each noodle dish has an option of protein and spicy level. They recently changed their spicy level to even spicier than before, and it is 0 through 5. 5 is Thai level spicy. Occasionally the sauces have fish in them, so vegetarians that care must state to their waiter they want the alternative sauce. I usually always get the Kee Mao with tofu. I used to get it spicy level 1, for just the right little kick, but since then I switched it to zero. I get a little dish of spice on the side so I can add as much as I want. The Kee Mao has wide noodles, bok choy and basil (and tofu). Simple and absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I love the food. The dishes are well prepared and price is a great value.  It can be a long wait since it's a popular spot for college and young professionals.  Wish you could actually call ahead for take out/ no phone!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore the ambiance here.  I ordered the Street Noodles #2 and it was very good.  Flavors are just right.  I asked for spice level 3 and it came out to be much spicier than I thought and when the server saw I was sniffling and red he gladly replaced it for me without extra charge.  I came at 3pm and it was almost empty so I avoided the crowd which was nice."}
{"text":"Another reviewer called this place \"shockingly disappointing.\" What a beautiful way to put things. I have had several people recommend this place, and I constantly see a line out the door. Yet, the food tastes no better than your chain \"Asian\" food run by a White guy. I've gone twice now, convinced the first bad meal must have been a bad night for the chef or a bad dish selection on my part. Nope, the place is consistently serving underwhelming food. Even the $9 price tag does not make it worth it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and decor here, though not much lighting.  Be aware that you can pay with cash only, though apparently they do have an ATM on site. Service was speedy and friendly.

They have appetizers, several $9 noodle bowls and soups, and a few $6 options as well.  I tried:

- Chiang mai curry: This is apparently their most popular dish and has chicken in it.  I thought tasted like a good coconut milk curry should but it definitely wasn't my favorite of the group
-  Kee mao with tofu: Really enjoyed the extra wide rice noodles in this but preferred the sauce in the see yew
- See yew with tofu: My favorite of the bunch, particularly loved the noodles (same as the ones in the kee mao), broccoli, and sauce"}
{"text":"Updating cos I just added photo. Still as good. Still going for Love Boat for my late lunch. Still as delicious as it was. Still small and I wish they do a $9 size Love Boat. Btw I still drank all the soup. 

See Yew is good too. Slight improvement on the shrimp. 

Ice tea is ok. One free refill."}
{"text":"I managed to avoid the dinner rush other reviewers have mentioned, and took a seat at the bar and was promptly given a menu. I placed my order and the food arrived in minutes while I made small talk with the waiter on staff. The staff were warm and friendly, and that was just the start of my amazing dinner here.

The ginger beer they offer is excellent - just enough spice and heat and not too much ginger to over power the noodles. I had the pork buns to start and they were incredible - a good blend of pork and doughy flavor.

The Pad Thai was a real standout though. You can order it as hot as you want it, and I went for the Thai Hot because I love a bit of heat to my food. Noodlehead did not disappoint, and the portions are more than generous for the price. 

There wasn't too much sauce on the noodles, and they were thin and plentiful to pick up all the flavors. The chicken was cut up into portions a bit large for my taste, and they were a bit dry, but not enough to take away from the overall meal.

If you get in before the large crowds, it's a nice place to get a good meal at a good price."}
{"text":"You cannot reserve because they don't have a phone and only accept cash. Oh they have a fancy website btw. That's good enough to get me interested. Another BYOB place with no corkage (nice). Please don't come here without wine at 9 PM and expect the wine store to be open nearby. The review is for their Street Noodle #1. In short, it was ok. Not the best noodles I've had. The fried chicken was oily. I ordered a spice level 3 and it was pretty spicy. I recommend a 2. The appetizers were also decent and only come in pairs. No wonder they are priced so low. It's a nice place to hang out with your friends/family and have some hot and spicy food. 3 stars!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of noodles and curry and with Pittsburgh's recent amazing food scene, there have been many places where have I enjoyed the noodles and curry separately but Noodlehead goes over the top with having dishes with both! I had the Chiang Mai Curry and it was for lack of better words to articulate-AMAZING! 
I got a level 3 out of 5 and it was the perfect combination of spice. The curry was outstanding as well were the noodles. 
I am picky about meat when it comes to most restaurants but noodlehead prepared the chicken perfectly. It was not too soft but not hard, it was kind of like having some tofu or Indian paneer.
Service, I would give a 3 out of 5. Our server seemed very annoyed; however, food arrived promptly. 
The only cons I would say would be this is a CASH ONLY restaurant (however, there is a on site ATM) and there is no alcohol menu (it is BYOB.)
Despite this, I would highly recommend noodlehead. The food outweighs all."}
{"text":"Ummm so I found a dead fly in my noodles. I went there with my girlfriend because of all the great reviews and it honestly lived up to it ... until we found a dead fly in one of our dishes which is an automatic 1-star in my book."}
{"text":"I could eat here every day. Best Thai I have ever had. Quick, friendly, sooooo delicious. I don't even care that they are cash only (and I hate cash)."}
{"text":"I thought the food here was very good. We got multiple appetizers and I got the pad see yew as my entree. I really enjoyed the pad see yew- the tofu was cooked well and the sauce was sweet like pad see yew I've had in the past. The vegetable spring rolls and the sweet chili sauce it comes with was also great. Definitely want to come back!"}
{"text":"Just really decent delicious food for a great price. The pad Thai is awesome, tastes clean and non-oily, perfectly balanced flavor combination, just a damn good dish. Cash only which you get used to after a while. My monthly chicken pad Thai fix here in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Man, this place is loud!
I had Tofu Pad Thai (not many options when it comes to vegetarian food). My husband had Street Noodles #1. My dish was good, I asked for a 3 in terms of heat and I got what I asked for. The server forgot to give us glasses, who can blame him, this places was packed! We waited 20+ minutes as adviced until they found us sits at the window. 
I can't complain about the food, neither would my husband but we weren't impressed when compared to other places I left a review for. 
We noticed that other people's dishes looked to be a lot bigger than ours but that's probably because of the type of noodles. We think. We hoped. 
Cool fact: BYOB and it's 50¬¢ per person."}
{"text":"So right off the bat you will not be seated untill everyone in your group shows up.
The pace is very small but decorated with a nice feel.

Really the absolute worst thing about this place is the seating. Not only are you squashed right next to people you don't know but then are forced to sit on hard 
wooden/metal stools or benches and only a handfull of a lucky few get a soft seat with a back. It really is very uncomfortable (my back hurt the rest of the night). Not just for your body but some seating is sharing a picnic table with strangers or even worse screaming children (oh joy).
Husband and I both ordered veg spring rolls and the street noodles number 1, which was very tasty and the chicken was perfect. 
 Also on the plus side you can choose how spicy you want any dish.

They were fairly busy and our no ice, lack luster warm tap water didn't quite quench our thirt. Our waiter was also virtually nonexistent.
 
IT is also BYOB, which were were not aware of so a big thanks to the people next to us for sharing. 
Clearly my rating is for tasty food and not much else.
We will go back, except for take out. 

And PS: Its cash only, but they have an ATM"}
{"text":"The service isn't good enough to be cash only. I've never had a good waiter. The food is great, but they don't deliver, don't accept reservations, and clearly you can't order ahead unless you pay cash."}
{"text":"Finally- Thai food that has won me over! I was never a fan of Thai food until I dined at Noodlehead this weekend.

The pork bun appetizer is reminds you of the ones at Ippudo, except the pork is pulled. The bun is pillowy soft, and is worth the $3 splurge on these melt-in-your-mouth bites.
The wings were pretty tasty as well- three pieces in one order. 

We also tried the See Yew Noodles with Chicken and the Chiang Mai Curry. I'm used to eating rice with my curry, but having chewy, wavy noodles with the curry was awesome. I actually wanted to order more noodles for the leftover curry sauce. The See Yew Noodles were really flavorful as well, the I loved the chewy texture of the flat noodles. The cold pickled cucumber garnish was a perfect complement to the spicy dishes.

The best part? The dishes were under $10! This makes Cash-Only acceptable. Can't wait to try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"It's a simple place - much more casual than either Typhoon or Kanok.  Beware: Cash only!  It's a small menu, which originally turned me off, but I was pleasantly surprised.

We ordered the sweet and spicy pig wings and they were so so good.  Tender, perfectly combination of sweet and spicy.  I ordered the see yew noodles with chicken, spiciness level 1.  Next time I'm dropping that down to a zero, as it was a hair too spicy.  Their prices are very reasonable ($9 for noodle plates, and I had some to bring home to the husband).  Also, BYOB.  I stopped by the wine store (down the street!) before I met my friend.  Expecting a $2-3 corking fee and only being charged fifty cents for recycling? Nice."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh! The food is to die for. You have to try it at least once but I'm sure you'll come back another 20+ times!"}
{"text":"Delicious pork belly buns and sizable portions for decent price. But wow their food is spicy. I've tried the sliced grilled beef,  kee mao, and street noodle number 1. For the noodles ordered it at a level 3. First few bites were delicious. After the initial bites, my mouth was on fire and my tastebuds were shot. Couldn't taste or feel anything but heat. The second time I came here I ordered the kee mao again except at a level 1. It was much more manageable but still very spicy. So lesson learned. Order the level 1 if you can't handle spicy."}
{"text":"High-quality food at reasonable prices. I came here on a recommendation from a friend and I was pleasantly surprised. We were seated almost immediately even though the restaurant seemed crowded. Great atmosphere but the lighting is a little dark. Food was superb. They give you multiple levels of spiciness to choose from depending on your preference. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place and I'm glad I stopped in. After looking thru previous yelp pictures, I went with the street noodles and it was worth every penny. The spice level option is also a major plus as I can't handle alot of spice but being able to choose just how much you want is great. Although fried, the chicken was very tender and juicy. The noodles in the sauce were also a great pairing with the chicken. The restaurant itself has a very casual ambiance  and the staff was very helpful even with the place being crowded."}
{"text":"OMG
Delicious Thai food. If you are looking to go here give yourself 30-40 minutes wait time during busy hours. Totally worth it though. It's a BYOB. I will definitely go back when in town again. Pork sliders n chicken curry is what I got, both were phenomenal."}
{"text":"I have been to Noodlehead many times to dine in and for takeout. I really enjoy the food and atmosphere. I would give Noodlehead 5 stars if it weren't for two reasons. There is no phone to call in for takeout so you have to go there and wait about 15-20 minutes for your food. I took my mom there in the winter and they sat us near the front door. Every time someone opened the door, it was freezing cold and it ruined the experience. Other than those reasons, I would have given it a perfect rating. Also, I LOVE that it is BYOB and has a low recycling fee. 
The See Yew and Sukothai are great choices."}
{"text":"I've been twice.  Their menu is short, so not many choices, but everything I've had there has been good.  Prices are reasonable.  The ambiance is nice.  I recommend the pork buns appetizer and the pad thai.  I like my food spicier than most people, and ordered at a spiciness level of 3 out of 5 thinking that would be conservative, but I found even that to be too hot - hard to taste the food; I'm going to try 1 or 2 next time. (I wrote the above 6 months ago. I've since been back and tried spiciness levels 1 and 2. I prefer level 1.)

The first time I went, the service was quick; the second time (got there Wednesday 6:15) the service was sluggish toward the end of the meal as they filled up.

cash only, BYOB."}
{"text":"Pork buns are to die for! And for the vegetarians, spring rolls are a must try, as crispy as it gets!
For the main course, try a different one every time! Go now! :)"}
{"text":"My wife, myself and our two friends came here a few months ago. Our one friend is a vegetarian and she was easily able to be accommodated. We got the pork buns, fried chicken app and 3 of us had the See Yew and our vegetarian friend got the ale Mao. All of us enjoyed our meals immensely. The waitress was very good and attentive and the service was quick. Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday afternoon about 4pm. The place was almost empty other than a few people sitting outside. My little boy and I asked for a table for three (Hubs was parking). We were super hungry after running errands all day, and looking forward to trying a new place. The hostess immediately barked at us that should COULDN'T seat us until our \"entire party\" was present (As if this were some fancy establishment with a line out the door)... I perused a paper menu and my son was quiet, but getting a bit restless.  Did I mention that I'm pretty noticeably pregnant? The entry to the dark restaurant is tiny and cramped, with no place to sit. Did they really want my son, my belly and I to block the doorway for any other potential patrons? When my husband arrived at the door, our son went out to greet him, and seeing a few open tables (simple metal bistro style tables, mind you, not fancy white tablecloths) on the covered patio, they took a seat. I told the hostess that my husband had arrived and we'd like to sit outside if that was okay. The hostess said it looked like it was about to rain and would have to \"ask.\" She came back a few minutes later and said she couldn't seat us outside due to a forecast of rain, and I'd have to have \"the rest of my party\" come back inside before she would get us a table. First of all, when does it not look like it's going to rain in Pittsburgh, and secondly, other people had just been served outside. I've dined at restaurants from Manhattan to Milan and never been refused a table - especially not for such a reason on a slow Sunday afternoon. We went someplace less snobby, and thoroughly enjoyed eating outside on a warm day after a long winter. We won't go back to Noodlehead until that hostess gets her nose out of the air - and management has had a turnover as well - because they know nothing about service :)"}
{"text":"Gotta get some more cash so I can throw it at Noodlehead again. It's an excellent place to grab a bite of Thai food in Pittsburgh, and you don't have to pay that much to get it!

+ My friend and I were seated quickly at 6:30 PM on a Sunday night, but you could tell how popular this place is! The tables around us were all full. Great atmosphere for catching up with friends or for a casual date night. 
+ Lovely service. Our waitress was around at very appropriate times and always attentive to what we needed. 
+/- Menu is somewhat limited, but it also makes it easier to pick.
+ Super tasty Thai food. My friend and I loved the pork buns! Perfect textures and flavors. Pay attention to the spice scale, and you'll love your main dishes too.
- Cash only, so be prepared. On the bright side, there's an ATM in the restaurant now.

Until we learn to reverse engineer the pork buns, I definitely think we'll be back sometime in the future."}
{"text":"I had the steamed pork buns for an app, and the chiang mai for an entree. The pork buns were absolutely wonderful. The flavors were robust and really savory. The chiang mai had a very generous portion and a good level of spice (I got a \"1\" which is a 3-4/10 anywhere else). The coconut balanced out the heat, as well. $9 was a very fair price for the dish. I'll definitely try and go back sooner than later."}
{"text":"Love this place! Cheap quick eats. Usually we go for lunch or early dinner and it's never been that busy so I don't know how they do under pressure. But for lunch it can't be beat. Love the pork buns and pig wings- both are bites of fatty porky deliciousness. The street noodle one has the most crispy chicken that is just so good. Also love the see ew and kee mao. Byob and cash only so come prepared."}
{"text":"Crazy good food, prices are in the middle, atmosphere is great. Service was also good.This place can't go wrong. The street noodles were freakin delicious and the pork buns were good too. Our waitress was pregnant but she was quick and on it! Food is spicy and great. Everything costs $9, parking is nonexistent, and its cash only... Minus 1 star because they charge a fee if you get takeout!"}
{"text":"I have been told that everything on the menu is delicious but I haven't been able to get passed the Love Boat Soup.  I order it every single time.  I do not have a long history of loving/knowing good thai food but I do love this soup.  I order it at a 0 spice and ask them to bring the spice on the side.  

The wait staff is kind of BLAH and they are weird about taking your $20 bill for a $9 meal and asking if you want change - instead of just bringing your change.  Yes, I want my $11 change and you barely earned basic gratuity. every.single.time  But I will continue to go for the LoveBoatSoup both dine in and take out.  SO good.  

OPENS at NOON.  Went once at 11:30 and was surprised they dont open until noon.  Cash Only, ATM inside."}
{"text":"Updating my review because the last few times I've gotten take-out from here the spice level was all over the place. This used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the city, so I'm not sure what's happened. I've ordered both the Chiang Mai curry and the Street Noodle #1 at my normal Level 1 spiciness, but both dishes hardly had any spice to them. I was going to order a spice level 2 this most recent visit, however the waitress told me that they just started using new peppers so the dishes are a little spicier than normal, so I stuck with my normal 1. My Street Noodle #1 dish came out pretty bland, not very spicy at all, and the noodles were kind of dry. Not sure what happened to this place, but it's a real bummer."}
{"text":"If you get a craving for a flavorful bowl of soup with the perfect amount of spice and everything nice, go to the ATM and head over here for the sukothai or love boat noodles!  It's inexpensive and hits all the right spots.

The other dishes I have had here are just as tasty but IMO the snack sized portions of the sukothai and love boat are the main stars here. It's a shame they don't make place these two items on the entree menu but either way, it works! 

I have been fortunate to have had some really good Thai food but this place is different in the sense that they allow you to control the spice level ranging from 5 different levels. 

A gem in Pittsburgh and usually one of my most requested lunch spots!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe, good food, cash only. The spicy scale is helpful though the 1 (out of 0-5) was heartily spicy. I'd go back."}
{"text":"I actually checked this place out when I was helping my sister moved into CMU. The lack of Asians was a little perturbing at first but after trying their Pad Thai I have to say it does beat a lot of Asian run places out of the water. Very simple and straightforward menu. Very friendly and nice staff. Pad Thai has a very nice crunch with the chives they add and flavor wise it delivers. Highly recommended to go if you are in the area and you are need some Asian food. As a whole I think Noodlehead satisfies the cravings as it is lacking in good Asian food."}
{"text":"Great food! I was hesitant that it was BYOB and cash only but I'm glad I gave it a shot. The food was really good, and pretty cheap too! $9 for a plate. There was a weird $1 recycling charge or something on the bill so not sure what that is about... Maybe for the tap water? Great place for vegans and vegetarians!"}

{"text":"Amazing food and concept. Nothing crazy on the menus just lots of dishes that most anyone can enjoy. The spice scale is deceiving though. I usually order a medium at other restaurants but a 2 on their 5 point scale was far too spicy for me the one however was perfect."}
{"text":"The setting is very nice. Came here with a good friend of mine to catch up. 

First of all the restaurant is clean and appealing to the eye with its unique look. Very beautiful interior.

The menu was small and simple. My friend got the street noodle #1 and I got the pad Thai! I loved the pad Thai! Very good and his street noodles seemed delectable but not as good!

Appetizer I got was the sliced beef which was real juicy with a kick!

The waiter was pretty attentive bringing bottles of water soon after we finished. The only complaint I had was the 15 minutes we waited for him to take the check back- not a big deal but it was kind of long- especially because they weren't busy. 


Overall really good dining experience! 4.5 stars. Will return! Remember it is byob and a cash only business."}
{"text":"It used to be better.

I used to come to Noodlehead 2-3 times a week since it was on my way home. I always got the Chiang Mai Curry, the Pork Steam Buns, the Beef Soup, and the Love Boat. However, I noticed that for about a year now the food quality has gone WAY down. Not only are spice levels inconsistent (I always order \"2,\" but on some days it tastes like a 4 and on other days tastes like 0), but the quality of the ingredients (beef and chicken) have gotten worse as well. Sometimes, my food is too salty and other times too bland. I've noticed this to be especially true for the Chiang Mai Curry, which used to be my favorite dish from them but now tastes like noodles in sauce. It's no longer creamy and rich and covered with bean sprouts; rather, watered down curry with very few bean sprouts to garnish.

I don't think I'll be coming back anymore. Good thing I'm done with grad school in two more months."}
{"text":"We got there 15 min after it opened and there was already a wait. This place is so popular but they move people through quickly. Cash only and byob so come prepared!"}
{"text":"Great place with a hipster/urban feel to go with some friends for a cute dinner.

 Don't expect very good service or any kind of lumbar support (their chairs are a mix of seemingly recycled materials like benches and weird buckets) so I suggest bringing a big bottle of wine and settling in.

 Everything on the menu is good, big portions, price is right, BYOB (which I love), and it's in  a great shopping area.  If you want to try a bunch of different things, this is NOT the spot to go... but if you want to feast on a big bowl of noodles, then dig in!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I had to come because of all the great reviews and I was not disappointed. Staff was great, Food was cheap, and most importantly it tasted amazing! Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Not your average Thai restaurant with a menu limited only to noodle dishes, but what this restaurant lacks in variety it makes up for in decor and charm. You won't find a single Thai person working here (no offense intended) but this place is definitely \"cool\" an food is always tasty. Does not come close to Pusadees Garden but a good alternative when your in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely something different when it comes to Thai food. They have the tradition staples like Pad Thai but also have Thai street food that's very unique and delicious. The sukothai soup has some of best broth I've had in a long time, and the sides and curries are truly something else."}
{"text":"This was a completely disappointing experience, which is sad because at first glance this place has a lot done right.

a.) Great environment
b.) Small menu (I love concise menus! Makes ordering so much easier and gives me faith in what I order)
c.) Decent prices for Shadyside

But..well, that's where the fun ends. I ordered the Shrimp dish, and while it had a ton of fried shrimp, the dish was totally lacking in any synergy that made it feel like a dish. It was a combination of bulky food textures that were not consumable at once and really brought the experience down.

Fried shrimp,a mass of noodles, and sauteed bok choy with peppers doesn't make a good dish. You couldn't eat it together..the textures simply didn't mesh well. Furthermore, the flavor profile wasn't there either. Very let down.

The tea was nice btw.


p.s. this place is not really veg friendly."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night with a group of 5. It was packed with hardly anywhere to stand and wait. Our wait time was about 30 mins but it was well worth it. 

We were seated at a picnic like table and our server was very helpful with our questions. It's also BYOB and you only have to pay 50 cents per person for recycling. We ending up bringing 5 bottles! 

I started with the crispy vegetable spring rolls. They were very good and weren't greasy.  I ended up getting the Green Curry Linguine spice level 3. The hostess suggested I get a 2 but I was happy with my decision. I got a little hot and teary eyed at one point but I love spicy! I couldn't image what 4 and 5 would be like. But I hate when you go places and get a high number and it doesn't even do anything for you. This place is not like that! 

I'll be returning. There were so many other things I wanted to try!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. The chicken pad Thai is great, but don't get a 5. The food can be spicy"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious.  Pork buns are a must-have.  Have been three times and have yet to be disappointed.  Pad Thai is one of the best we've had in Pittsburgh, hands down.  Cash only, BYOB, delightful.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Barebones type of place. Great noodle bowls which are very hearty. The BYOB is a nice bonus as well. Usually requires a bit of a wait though. Would highly suggest if you are interested in good Thai. Noodlehead and Thai Cottage are my top two in this region."}
{"text":"I loved the appetizers (fried chicken and pork dumplings). The Kee Mao that was not bad, but I liked the Street Noodle 1 more because of the succulent fried chicken which comes along with the dish."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is amazing!! I came here because my friend who is familiar with Pittsburgh and it was an amazing choice.

My friend and I arrived about 5 minutes before they opened and there were already a few full tables so I recommend getting there early because it was packed by the time we left.

The food was incredible, I got the Love Boat and easily substituted tofu for the meat it came with. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. The spice levels on our two dishes were mixed up by accident and the waitress quickly brought us new dishes without any issues which we really appreciated. Service was quick but they did not rush us at all despite the business of the restaurant.

One thing to note - it is cash only!! Be sure you have cash before heading to Noodlehead but don't miss out on this amazing restaurant in Shady Side!"}
{"text":"They've added a few menu options, but the standard stays the same and is always delicious.  It can get busy during dinner time and on weekends and limited seating options for large groups, but the food is worth it.  The Chiang Mai Curry is a favorite as is the See Yew. It's BYOB which is becoming more common. A nice touch is that they'll 'uncork you' while you're waiting and you can pour yourself a glass while enjoying the sights and smells."}
{"text":"BY FAR the best thing was the fried chicken. It was wonderfully crispy and juicy and the dipping sauce was divine. I also had the pad Thai which was ok, it was kind of saucy. It tasted better as a leftover believe it or not, maybe because it dried up some. I will try another noodle next time. I was expecting a bare bones establishment based on the prices but this place is very tastefully decorated. A friend told me about this place and I absolutely recommend it too!"}
{"text":"The first time I visited noodle head with friends I was very apprehensive. Thai food can be intimidating with its intense flavors and aromas. Noodle head has the secret to Thai food. Not only is the food great and prepared in a quick fashion it's also BYOB. The atmosphere can range from family fun to date night. A wonderful place I highly recommend. One of the, if not, the best Thai restaurant around the city. Very very affordable especially for those college students! Try something out of your comfort zone!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night in warm weather and good spirits! Parking was a breeze to get - thanks to Pittsburgh, we were able to get a spot directly across from the restaurant (and it was free parking after 6)! Being from Philly, that's pretty incredible on a Friday night. We were seated almost immediately outside, and were given waters along with the menu. The food selection was great, even for vegetarians like us - we ordered the Kee Mao and See Yew with tofu instead of other proteins. The Kee Mao had a 3 level of spice, which I found to be a perfect amount of heat. They have a bottle of Sriracha at the table if you'd like to be more brave. I didn't try the See Yew but heard that it was delicious as well. The portion sizes were also great, just enough to feel satiated but not so much to over-stuff.

Pricing was also great - only $9 per dish! Service was very friendly and sociable (almost seemed like the waiter was just a casual friend on the street who came up and asked for our order! We got our food quickly and were given our change back promptly as well. Every other review says this, too, but cash only. All in all, a huge thumbs up and I would definitely come back here soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites! They only take cash, no cards. I love being able to customize my spice level on their dishes."}
{"text":"I rarely venture outside my own neighborhood for Thai (because Nicky's is so awesome), but when I do--Noodlehead is where it's at.  They have a simple menu with a few vegetarian options, and don't do substitutions or pick-your-own-protein like most Thai places do.  That being said, the food is very good and FAST.

It's BYOB with a very small corkage fee, and they don't take reservations--I think I've always had to wait between 10 and 20 minutes to get a table, so keep that in mind.  It also might not be the best place for a first date since they do a lot of community seating, but I don't usually mind that.

For amazing food, fast, and at a very reasonable price--give Noodlehead a try!"}
{"text":"I'll take successful places to meet your tinder date for $2,500, Alex. WOWZA. Good first date AND good noms. 

Came here on a Thursday night about 5:30. We were seated and greeted really quickly. I ordered the first thing that I saw, the green curry linguini, level 2. (They apparently have a different heat scale than most Thai places?) My fabulous date had Kee Mao, at a 4. (I would be dead ) Mine was AMAZING. Clams, the sauce, the noodles! Now if I could just stop dropping food everywhere, and stop embarrassing myself, everything would have been fine. Haha. My date said he really enjoyed his dinner as well. 

Service was great, food was great. Date was a win. 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"It is relatively cheap for a good lunch. The pork belly steam bun is good. The meat is sweet and soft. And the food is not very spicy. Level 3 for me is actually \"a little spicy\". If you like spicy food, crazy hot (level 5) is your choice. For noodles, I recommend street noodles and Chiang Mai Curry! The green curry is also okay~But try the other two first! You wouldn't regret it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after visiting a relative in the hospital. I was really impressed when j approached because this restaurant has an awesome style/decor! Everything looks so fresh and the atmosphere is really great. 

There are a variety of table configurations including: small tables where one side is a booth and the other has a chair, long picnic table, countertop with bar stools, big round tables on giant barrels with higher chairs... This variety gives some great personality!

The service was fast and efficient when we arrived at about 3pm on a Sunday. We were greeted and served promptly!! 

The table set up is cute. Glasses are ready for you and they drop off a carafe of cool water. Love that! There was also a basket with napkins, a bottle of siraccha, and a container with forks, spoons, and chopsticks. When they brought the check, they brought it in a cute little woven basket. Love the attention to detail! 

We ordered love boat noodle soup and kee mao. I made good use of the fork to get the noodles onto my spoon and then dunked t for the broth. I love noodle soups! The beef was also cut in very bite-appropriate sizes and I was impressed at its tenderness. It's a dark, rich broth and lots of fresh basil. I liked it! 

The kee Mao boasts those incredible wide noodles. I love their texture! It was very tasty, although I have had more flavorful versions elsewhere.  We both got spicy level 2 \"medium\" and we were happy with that! 

I would absolutely return and try some additional dishes here. I hope to bump this place up to 5 when I return. It's close, but not quite there yet for me. Still.. Go and check it out!! 

Highlights:
Good food
Great employees
Exceptional atmosphere/decor

Don't forget it is byob and there is outdoor seating. 

Also, The menu is not overwhelming. Just a few key items for each category. Which is nice. 

Bring CASH! They do not accept credit cards. Although there is an atm there, the menu said. 

Wish I could have gotten better photos. Next time! ;)"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch yesterday with a friend, we ordered the vegetable spring rolls and pork belly under recommendation of the sever, both excellent choices, came out super quick too. I ordered the pad Thai with chicken, very flavorful, chicken was a bit dry though. My friend ordered something with chicken also, and agreed that the chicken was a bit dry. Everything was quite flavorful and great service, friendly."}
{"text":"I got Street Noodles 1 and hubby got Chiang Mai curry... both amazing and for our food personalities perfect. I got light spice and he got medium... again, spot on. Cute place, decorated perfectly. We went at 3:00pm on a weekday and there was plenty of seating- wouldn't have wanted to go any later, as it was filling up."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is the best Thai in Pittsburgh hands down. The BYOB restaurant is inexpensive and has a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Unauthentic... Beef soup was super salty, and did not taste thai. We had to dilute it with water ourselves.

The chiang mai curry lacked lemongrass and tasted weird. Sorry to say i wont be back based on the food.

We also ordered the pork buns that turned out to be super greasy.

The extra star is for the service, they are nice and 
attentive."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! Upon arriving there were at least 30 people waiting outside, and we waited for about 45 minutes- it was definitely worth it! Spring rolls and potato wedges were ok, but the Love Boat soup was AMAZING!!! Warning though, I love extra hot food, and the 3 was pushing it for me- don't underestimate how spicy the soup is! The pad Thai, pictured, I also ordered at a 3, and didn't seem as hot as the soup. Hands down I would recommend the Love Boat soup! Bring your own milk or stop by the ice cream shop next door afterward ;)"}
{"text":"Okay, Noodlehead. You have a modern-looking website, so the fact that you don't accept credit cards or even have a telephone can't be explained by the fact that you are run by adorably old school folks who don't understand how the modern world works. Nope, you understand just fine...you just choose to play by your own rules. And given how packed it was when we were here, it seems that people are are willing to accept the fact that they have to order in person if they want take out, aren't able to make reservations, and have to use cash to pay for their food.

While I do find those aforementioned things annoying and inconvenient (come on, does anyone really carry cash around anymore?!), I did enjoy my dinner at Noodlehead. With no way of making reservations, we just showed up and hoped the wait wouldn't be too long. It was about 30 minutes on a Saturday night, which isn't bad. We were given seats at the bar that overlooks Highland Ave, so the people watching was fun (apologies to the table dining outside right beside the window, though....nothing is more uncomfortable than having people staring at you as you eat your food....but in our defense, it was literally unavoidable for you to be in our field of vision!)

Anyway, the vibe of this restaurant is quite trendy and modern, and it's quite loud here. Their menu is fairly small. For our meals, I ordered the Street Noodles #1 (Thai fried chicken, rice noodles, bok choy, sprouts, cilantro) and hubby ordered Chiang Mai Curry (egg noodles, chicken, greens, and shallots in a curry sauce). You can choose your spice level, and be aware that they take their spiciness seriously....so don't try to be a hero and go for the highest level unless you're sure you can handle it.

Our food came out in short order, which was fortuitous because we were hungry. My street noodles was a generous portion, although I was bummed that my dish seemed to be missing the promised cilantro (I'm a huge fan of cilantro). But lack of cilantro aside, the dish was still quite tasty. The sauce was an interesting blend of sweet, spicy, and sour. The noodles soaked up most of the sauce, so there was plenty of flavor throughout the dish. The Thai friend chicken was very moist and had good flavor, but the breading was a bit soggy in spots, which was disappointing. The dish would've been better if the chicken had been crispier. My husband's Chiang Mai noodles were delicious....loved the rich, creamy, coconutty sauce in this dish. 

While it's not my favorite Thai food in Pittsburgh, it's definitely one of the more unique takes on Thai food, and certainly good enough for a repeat visit. Oh, and BYOB as well. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place deserves 4.5 stars, but I can't round it up to 5 just yet!

Four of us met for dinner on a Saturday at 6PM and waited about 5 minutes for a table to open up.  I absolutely loved the atmosphere, with the wooden tables and bar seating at the window.  We were handed menus and a bottle of water appeared at our table.  Having our own bottle of water was great for the spicy dishes!

We brought a bottle of wine; it's BYOB and corkage is only $0.50 per person! Awesome. The menu is small, but they had 3 vegetarian options for noodles and I opted for the tofu pad thai.  I went for no spice, and the fiancee got it at spice level 3.  His biggest compliment about the food was that with this dish, unlike many other pad thais around Pittsburgh, the spice level you order actually corresponds to what you expect! Finally!  I thought the dish was a good size for the price.  The tofu was cooked perfectly and there was plenty of it.

I really wish they had a vegetarian appetizer, and I also with they did take-out.  Cash only too.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love noodlehead!!! The ambiance is the best part (next to the noodles of course). Let me just say, they have the water situation down. You sit at the table, and already there is a chilled glass bottle of water and glasses ready for you, including all of the cutlery accoutrement you could want. The service is quick, and the noodles are delicious, especially with their great tofu! My favourite is the Pad See Ew, lots of yummy broccoli with it too. Remember though, they take cash only! And parking can be a little bit of a pain. But worth it."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food places I have ever eaten in. Generous portions. The veggie and vegan drunken noodles is awesome. Dessert at Millie's next door is an added advantage. Also super cheap. They accept only cash."}
{"text":"Noodlehead has been a largely positive experience. The food is very fresh and the Pad Thai goes very well with shrimp. The dumplings are also very flavorful and everything is priced well for the amount that you get. Try not to go on Saturday night around 7, especially when it's warm. Regardless, the food comes out very quickly so this makes it worth it!"}
{"text":"The Pad Thai and the Pork Belly Buns are amazing. I'm not sure what the buns are made of... But it's heavenly. Also they are BYOB, which is a plus. The servers are always so nice and pleasant here! The prices are very good here as well. Don't forget your cash for this place- cash only!!"}
{"text":"Hey so, I enjoyed this place alot! The food came fast ! I had the pad see yew medium spice! I will say it seemed a little more spicy ... Over all this was good and def worth a second look! I love Thai and this is on return to list... Only thing I didn't like much was how difficult is can be to get your waiters attention... The menu is limited but great and will satisfy your needs and it is cash only and byob! Which is normally a tradition for burghers .."}
{"text":"Great food...HORRIBLE WAIT. Go for lunch or expect to be in line for OVER an hour."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Pittsburgh! The menu is small with no substitutions (except for tofu and meat.)  All of the noodle dishes are great and spice adjusted according to your taste... my go to is the Street Noodle 2 though!  The only inconveniences is that the restaurant is cash only (there is an ATM in the back of the restaurant though) and they don't take reservations.  Thus, you can wait in line for a very long time to get seated (I think I've waited up to 2 hours before.)  Definitely worth the wait though! And take out is an option too."}
{"text":"Very authentic.. I love the Sukothai.. Be careful, level 2 is very spicy in my opinion"}
{"text":"Honestly, if you haven't been here yet, you're doing something wrong. The food is cheap- and good.

Getting a table here with a group can be a problem on the weekend because they don't take reservations, so come early or eat late. The menu is small enough that you'll be able to decide what you want pretty quickly, and it's hard to go wrong. My personal favorite is the Sukothai, a lighter alternative to most of the other dishes on the menu. The noodle soup is topped with bean sprouts, an egg, some vegetables, and crispy wonton strips, and is the perfect dish for a cold winter day. If you're feeling more traditional, the Pad Kee Mao and the Chiang Mai Curry are both delicious dishes that are a little more hearty."}
{"text":"This food was great. Really great. I had the see yew with chicken and it was really good with a generous portion size. BYOB which is cool, and only 50 cents per person corking fee. My husband says the pork buns are really REALLY great.

Reasons they did not get 5 stars: 1. Cash only. 2. The quirky stools they use look trendy but are extremely uncomfortable to actually sit and dine at. When I'm out to eat I want to be able to lay back and relax but you can't because the chairs don't HAVE backs. 3. The whole \"We're too cool to have a phone\" thing makes me roll my eyes.

But the food is really so good I'll suffer through those minor inconveniences. 

PS If you want takeout you have to order at the counter and wait. They don't have a phone. Which is just weird."}
{"text":"When I wana seem way more worldy than I actually am I go on and on about my favorite pho place and craft beer.  Didnt have pho or craft beer here though.  Saw that this place was BYOB so we walked 2 blocks over to a liquor store and bought a twist off bottle of some white wine.  I prefer a 40 but the hip, young professionals in this place and part of town would have scoffed for sure.  Had steamed pork belly bun and some flat nooble dish with skrimps and basil.  Both were friggin great and I wana come back and try more!  People in reviews keep crying about cash only...this place is cash only.  ATM isnt only an awesome sex act....it dispences money....to use here..."}
{"text":"Very solid food. Nice ambience. Simple menu, but it works, and I like simplicity. Good prices. Have been there a few times and will continue to return, as it's relatively cheap, close to me, and open til 10 pm. I ordered out once and was a little disconcerted to find that I couldn't call it in but actually had to walk there, order, and wait for it, but my food was done fast, and I was heading back out the door within 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"Pork belly buns are the best thing on the menu...i could eat several those!
Thai fried chicken appetizer was also really tasty and crisp, but its the same chicken that is on the street noodle #1 so if you are going to get that its a little repetitive.

Chiang mai noodles spice level 5 was great!  I think the noodle choice was a little wrong b/c I feel they just dont' go with it, but overall the broth was really good.

Give it a try!

Service sucks though."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY-- good thing I checked yelp before I came here. But the pad thai was some of the best I have ever tasted. Very aesthetic and rustic on the inside. Fairly low crowd around late lunch time."}
{"text":"OH YES, what a find!  This place is legit!  A very small menu but everything on it is delicious (unlike some places with huge menus and very hit or miss dishes!).  

We started with the PORK BUNS and the first bite into that lovely fresh bun and they won the stamp of approval from this Chinese girl!  We had both the smaller noodles ---SOKUTHAI and LOVE BOAT which were both extremely tasty and flavorful.  We had the CHIANG MAI CURRY noodles which has crunch noodles on the top and a rich curry broth.  Spice can range from 0-5 for all the noodles.

The service was quick and attentive.  The atmosphere good for all needs---a quick bite in, an intimate date, or a group of friends.  Nice and full on a Monday night, I have a feeling this place is going to take off so get a seat now!  We will definitely be back as I am already craving for the next bowl."}
{"text":"I'm really in to this place. The fried chicken is so tasty that it's an appetizer that can be eaten as a meal if you have someone in the group who thinks they don't like Thai, like my kids. I had the kee mao the first time I was here. It was good but it's my favorite dish at two other places so it wasn't something I was super excited about. On my second visit we split the street noodles #1 and street noodles #2. With both meals I was way more enthusiastic. We got both with medium heat, 2 on the spice level, and it was an easy heat that added a nice level without taking away from the delicious flavors. The portions are a perfect size; we finished our food and left pleasantly and comfortably full.

Everything is $9 and under but the decor/design doesn't feel discount. BYOB, which I like, and they serve Mexican Coke. Not sure I'd show up with a large group because they don't take reservations, however, there's a nice choice of places to keep busy during a wait so it can be done."}
{"text":"This place is cute and food is very good and inexpensive. Sukothai noodles, pad thai, and pork sliders are my favorite! Service is good. Cash only, but ATM is inside the restaurant. Casual and fun."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of finding this place due to the location. (it's down the street from my job.) I LOVE the environment and how sweet the employees are. I always get the #2 street noodle and it's just the right portion for the price. Please be aware of the spice levels, they don't kid with it."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY. They do have ATM on site. It was alright. I've had better Thai food. I specifically went out of my way and in the opposite direction of home to get noodles from Noodlehead. I didn't love it, but I'll certainly go again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"So let me begin by saying about two years ago, this was my absolute favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh...delicious food, great experience and consistent product. Recently they have \"changed their spices to give customers a more consistent experience\". The exact opposite has happened and now this wonderful restaurant has turned into just another mediocre Thai place. The food either has 0 taste or is so spicy (I used to get a 4/5 and loved it) it's not enjoyable. If you are reading this, Noodlehead, PLEASE go back to the old ways, I miss you. Otherwise, you've lost a customer in me."}
{"text":"This place is pretty small and always packed especially as everyone gets off work because it's BYOB with a 50 cent recycling fee per person. Also cash only. I like that because it's fuss free for the most part when paying. If you don't have cash they have an ATM towards the back on the right. Their bathrooms are back there too and I find they're too dim in the evenings. They're nice and clean though.

I've sat inside and outside (during warmer temps) and I like the outside when it's crowded because sometimes it can get too loud and then you're struggling to hear the person across from you. On the other hand the inside can be better so people walking by on the sidewalk don't gawk at you eating from the big portions they give you. Big, tasty portions.

The two appetizers (which can basically be meals on their own) I'm obsessed with are the pork buns and fried chicken. I'm drooling already. The pork buns have a mix of flavors and it's kind of sweet/savory and perfect. As for the fried chicken..well..it's a generous portion of crunchiness and that red sauce they give you is just the right amount of spicy for me. I'm kind of a wuss when it comes to spicy even though I love spicy stuff in general. Here, they already make it a little zingy and then ask you what number on the spicy scale you want it on top of that.

I always get see yew with shrimp and I'm never ever disappointed. It contains big flat noodles, broccoli, black soy sauce that's sweet and egg. It's only $9! Sometimes the service can be lagging but the people are friendly, the place is nice, and the food has me coming back. Also, they always have beautiful fresh flowers up front that I notice. I love that touch!"}
{"text":"Noodlehead is known for their quick service, nice ambiance, and cheap noodles. Although their advertisement is for their noodles, I'm actually not a big fan of them. I find their noodles not flavored enough, especially lacking in the citrus category. It doesn't taste authentically Thai, which throws me off. However, the restaurant does a good job with their spicy options. From 1-10, you get mild to extremely spicy (I warned you). Also, their pork dumpling appetizer is really amazing, combining an interesting combo of pork with pickles. 

So pork dumplings were good, place is nice, but just thought the noodles in the main spotlight fell short of what I wanted."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY. NO RESERVATIONS. Heck...NO PHONE to call ahead and place an order for pickup, either.

It's okay, though...they make up for those slight inconveniences by offering delicious food at a fair price, a lively, but cozy atmosphere, and being BYOB!

The space is really nice, and always packed after about 6 or so. I wouldn't recommend stopping in with a larger group unless you a) get there early, or b) aren't in a rush, because you'll definitely be waiting. The service is good, and the staff has always been nice, whether we at in or got takeout.

As for the food, I love it. It's obviously subjective, but their noodle dishes more-or-less rival my favorite dishes from other Thai places in Pgh. The pad thai is flavorful, but lacks the oiliness that Nicky's (one of my favorites on flavor) tends to have. The pad see yew is predictably sweet, the kee mao is awesome in it's own right and always battles it out for my noodle dish of choice. Those are the only three that I've tried and I've really enjoyed them all...so much so that I haven't felt the need to stray...yet.

Their snacks also win me over. I enjoyed the Thai fried chicken, but it wouldn't be my first choice. The slice grilled beef is awesome, as well, but if you're only going to order one thing on the \"snacks\" menu, you MUST try the pork belly steamed buns. Every time we order them, I always wish I had ordered another order (or two). The texture, with the pillowy bun and the flavors...droooooool. 

It's also fairly-priced. For example, you can grab takeout for two (two noodle dishes) for under $20. Yeah, it's not the cheapest noodles you'll ever find, but you won't feel like you overspent by any means after you try the noodles. The food also comes out fast, whether you order dine-in or takeout, so don't be deterred due to the lack of being able to call ahead to place your to-go order. It'll be out in a matter of minutes! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good food at reasonable prices in a very spartan setting.  The food was good and fresh.  The services was a tad slow, but we did arrive during the peak of the lunch hour rush.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Last weekend was my 3rd attempt at trying to eat here, but my 1st time actually eating there since I never could find parking. Note: Parking is hard to get so either come for lunch (more parking) or take transportation that doesn't require street parking!

Food: I had the Pad See Yew (with tofu) and it was great! The noodles were cooked well and tasted extremely fresh. Their spicy scale goes from 1-5 and after anticipating a lot of heat from 5, I decided on a 4. I would recommend spicy eaters to just go for the 5, the 4 was not spicy at all.

FOR VEGETARIANS: You can get any of the noodle dishes with tofu, but they do not offer any appetizers (or can alter any current dishes) to accommodate vegetarians. I found this a bit weird, although my friends raved about the pork buns.

Service: The service was good and fast, although if you drink a decent amount of water I would request two jugs of water instead of one. One complaint I have was that the waiter did not check-in with us throughout the meal besides bringing our food, replacing the water after 15 minutes and bringing the check over (of which we had to go to the front of the restaurant to ask for).

Overall: One of the better Thai eateries in Pittsburgh - a definite recommendation! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm really having some trouble figuring out how to review this place. Let's start with the good things...

Good - The food was good. Not anything special and/or outstanding. But it was good. The menu is small, meaning (hopefully) they do all of the items well. And you can pick your spice level from 0 (none) to 5 (super spicy). I had a 3 and it was good.

Unfortunately, there are several bad things. None of these alone would keep you away...but it is important to know about them.

Bad - Very little street parking (although, you can go a block or two away and park for free on the side streets)

Bad - Cash only. I don't understand why, but Pittsburgh seems to have more \"cash only\" places than any other city I've been in. They do have an ATM on site.

Really bad - They don't have a phone. That's unheard of these days. That means you can't call and see what the wait is like. That means you can't call in a take out order (you can go there, order, and wait).

The place is usually busy, so I don't understand why they won't invest a few bucks in a credit card reader or, more notably, a phone.

Also of note...when we were there, it seemed like there were only a couple of servers. It didn't necessarily affect our food service (food was still hot), but it was tough to find someone when we needed more water and had a question.

Overall I'd say...go. Stop by, eat, see what you think. The food is good...and if you know about all the negative things ahead of time, you'll know what you're getting into. 

(note - the picture is the pad thai with chicken after a couple bites...sorry, I was hungry)"}
{"text":"The best Thai in Pittsburgh. Get the pork buns."}
{"text":"After coming here repeatedly, I think Noodlehead has won me over. 

I had a chance to try not only their pad thai which I was not satisfied with (because I am dead set on how it should be made) but also their Street noodle #2, kee mao, see yew, chiang mai curry, and pork belly steamed buns. 

After going there the 4th time I must say that they offer a great variety of interesting noodles that could satisfy anyone! I don't actually remember why I didn't like it in the first place but their noodle dishes are always scrumptious and I can't wait to go back and try some noodle soups! 


p.s. They also offer great teas there so don't fret to try those out as well."}
{"text":"This place absolutely rocks. I'm not surprised Noodlehead is so loved and consistently packed even though the 2 previous restaurants in this space weren't able to survive. The dishes are so tasty and reasonably priced. It's really fun and family friendly. BYOB is an added bonus. 

The Chiangmai curry is my go-to dish but we're also big fans of the Pad Thai. And don't forget about the pork buns!"}
{"text":"Very RUDE HOST. Her approach was aggressive. She dismissed me and my party from her seating post like we were not guest. We immediately left to spend our money else where."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for fast-food styled Thai-inspired meal. Overall, a solid meal at a reasonable prices, but the line can get long and with the lack of phone service or credit card, getting any kind of meal, to-go or dine-in, can be quite the wait.

Things I ordered:
- pork buns are absolutely delicious! They're sweet and savory, the bun is like chewing a cloud, and the sauces are rich, creamy, and blend well with all the ingredients.
-street noodle number 1: everything is delicious; noodles have a good chewiness and are not soggy. Only thing I didn't like is that the chicken is unremarkable for \"thai fried chicken\"
-street noodle number 2: again, everything about it is very good. Sauce is not overpowering, but the \"tempura shrimp\" reminds and tastes like something from the frozen foods section of a grocery store (but still yummy!)
-kee mao: noodles again well-cooked, sauce is well-balanced. I really enjoy the basil flavor in this dish
-see yew: again, a well-balanced dish with strong basil flavor.
-pad thai: I did not enjoy this dish. For me noodles were a hit or miss. Flavor could be more developed e.g. perhaps a more complex peanut sauce, something more savory thrown in. Overall unmemorable pad thai dish.

Things I liked:
-overall food is delicious (see above paragraph)

Things I didn't like:
-no phone service
-very loud environment. Often times I could not hear my dinner partner, but at least I can enjoy the meal! I personally would not recommend this place for a dinner date unless you go during a low demand hour or really just want the food and don't want to eat alone. But beware because it's-
-cash only"}
{"text":"Such a relaxed environment that you can even go in solo, find a comfy seat by the window and grub on some seriously good food."}
{"text":"great price and great food. the downside is cash only. recommend street noodle #1 and #2, see yew, and pad thai"}
{"text":"One of my very favorite restaurants in the city. No phone, no reservations, and cash only! The atmosphere is great. Wood and metal decor and some big tables for sharing. The menu is not huge, but it doesn't need to be. Everything is delicious. The appetizer of pork steamed buns is SO good. I can't go there without those steamed buns .. 

You can choose your spice level for each dish. I warn that its pretty spicy. They have a scale from 1-5 and although I'm not very big on spicy things, sometimes a level 1 is a little much. So I'd stick to a lower number to start and you can always add spice if it's not enough. 

It's also BYOB, which is a huge perk because the fee is .50 a person .. So basically free. It's also right down the street from a big wine store where i always stop to grab a bottle before i head there. 

The service is also always good and quick even if the place is packed we never wait that long to eat once we are sitting."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a casual, cheaper dinner with the added bonus of BYOB, this is it. The food is amazing and never disappoints."}
{"text":"**CASH ONLY** (How come no ones shouts it out in the first sentence?!) Btw, they still charge you tax, so bring your extra change!

WOWWWWW. I've tried many Thai places and I have to say, this is definitely ranking in my top 3 spots! Too bad it's so far away from home...BOOHOO. Lucky you guys, Pittsburgh! 

Pro tip 1: your whole party has to be there to be seated...this place is always poppin', so it makes sense that they reinforce that! 
Pro tip 2: You can BYOB?! (Is that a PA thing...?) Cool cool. I saw people just poppin' bottles of champagne for lunch! 
Pro tip 3: parking lot at the little plaza right by Chipotle/Pure Barre/Fine Wines. Walk over! 

TLDR; 
Menu: 5/5 simple, clean and crisp. Vegetarians welcome, carnivores especially welcomed. 

Ambiance: 4/5 A little dark in some areas, but definitely a great spot for all ages. 

Quality: 5/5 For what you're paying, this is just as good (or even better) than places that make you pay 1.5x/2x! 

Quantity: 4/5 Definitely enough to be 70% full. 

S/O to Martin X. for taking me here! We ordered:

SNACKS
1) Pulled pork belly steamed buns ($6) // DELICIOUS!!! Must get. Everyone is literally getting this. Comes with 2 steamed buns! 

NOODLES:
1) Chiang Mai Curry ($9) // I recommend medium spicy if you want to be safe, but go spicier if you're a hot shot! :P 
+1 Curry is delicious! I need some rice with this...seriously. 
+Noodles were perfect! Comes with fried noodles on top too for garnish. 

MORE NOODLES:
1) Kee Mao ($9) // Don't forget to pick your protein! (tofu, chicken, or pork)
+1 Balanced blend of vegetables, protein and noodles! 
+1 Not too salty..thank goodness. 

Overall, amazing spot for a quick lunch! Service is efficient and ambiance is great. It's nice that they keep the menu short, because they specialize and highlight only on certain dishes. I can totally see this being a food truck....gahhhhh. Come to CA!"}
{"text":"I love the concept and the execution. They only offer a small handful of noodle soups and dishes, and they're all the better for it. Everything is delicious and you just pick what you're (most) in the mood for. The prices are perfect for what you get, and you walk away feeling great. We stopped by on a Friday afternoon for a late-ish lunch (2pm), and most other places we looked up were not yet open. The staff was super friendly, the food came out quickly. What more could you ask for if you like thai noodles. Authentic? Don't know. Don't care. Yum. Please come to Philly!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on a Thursday evening and had a twenty minute wait. The place is always packed and busy, so we were pretty lucky. The service was fast and the food was incredible. You get a good amount of food for the price you pay. I got the see yew with chicken in it at the \"very hot\" spice level. I'm used to Indian cuisine, so to me, this was a perfect level of heat without it being too much. However, if you are used to milder flavors, I would definitely go down a spice level or two. (it is cash only - so make sure you bring some with you)"}
{"text":"Cash only, good food for they money (nothing is over $10 I think), average to bad service, which is why I give it a 3 star rating."}
{"text":"Very affordable and tasty Thai cuisine. The atmosphere is really neat... my husband and I feel like we are dining in a fancy place an can eat well for under $30 with a tip"}
{"text":"Great place for noodles! Quick service. Restaurant tends to get a bit busy and loud. Outdoor seating is available as well."}
{"text":"Love this place. I like hot so the 3 is good for me. I always order the #2 with the hot ginger ale to drink. Nice atmosphere and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Those pork belly buns are fantastic! Also, the \"Love Boat\" noodle soup, spice level 4 was delicious! We will be returning."}
{"text":"The service and food are always  amazing and even when we had a little problem, it was taken care of immediately and beyond the call of duty! Will always go back and will recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Love Noodlehead. A Pittsburgh and shadyside staple at this point. Great food and low price."}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant after stumbling across it on Instagram. The restaurant had a very nice cute setting and was BYOB which I love!

We decided to try the pork belly buns and we were not disappointed. Even better with a little siracha on them. As an entree I tried the See Yew with tofu. I think it could have used a little extra sauce but other then that it was very good. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Noodlehead is a great spot! I have loved every meal I have tried, especially the pork steamed buns, the beef soup, and the love boat. The beef is always tender and delicious. The spice levels go from 0-5.  Experienced spice eaters only above level 3!  

Noodlehead does not take reservations, so be prepared to wait during peak times. They are BYOB, and only charge a small recycling fee. I suggest bring wine to drink while you wait - I've waited an hour before (the food is that good)! They also don't have a phone, so you need to go in to order takeout. They are cash only, but do have an ATM. Their prices are all below $10!

Only negative would be that I have experienced mixed service during my visits at Noodlehead. Most servers are great, but I've found that a few are less than friendly."}
{"text":"Great ambience, high quality Thai food. 

Ordered the pad see ew with tofu, spice level 5, and light fish sauce. Although it was still pretty drenched in fish oil, it was tasty -- would've liked it more spicy though!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  Loved the atmosphere which had a lot of character with all of the wooden paneling and furniture.  It's supposed to be Thai noodle street market style dishes.  The prices are very reasonable and everything was delicious and spiced well."}
{"text":"SETTING:
Modern decor with dark colors, subtle asian themes, wooden panels. Dimly lit. Casual.  

FOOD:
Pork belly steamed buns (appetizer) and Street noodles #1 (entree)

While waiting in a long line, I noticed a few tables with pork belly steamed buns. Intrigued, I honed in on one particular table and watched intently as the group of friends happily nibbled on the appetizer. It's easy to spot genuine happiness. You know, the \"I-don't-care-how-goofy-I look\" signature smile that spans from ear to ear? 

When we finally got seated, we knew we had to order them buns (each order comes with 2 buns). I asked the waiter for napkins, but after 5 minutes of waiting, I caved. I knew it was going to be a bit messy. The first bite was all I needed to do my best impression of that same goofy smile...and more. A tangy and spicy orange sauce graced the ends of my mouth. Never have I looked more handsome-- 'sup, ladies. The chilled cucumbers complimented the warm and tender pulled pork well. It's worth noting that this version of the pork belly bun is different in that the meat is actually pulled pork, and not the chunk of pork belly that is usually served with these kinds of buns. Different, and still delicious.  

Street noodle #1. Number one in its name and number one in my stomach. Fried chicken with flat noodles, bok choy, cilantro. The generous amounts of fried chicken was definitely a plus! Nothing makes me more mad than when restaurants skimp on the meat. Sauce was not too overpowering, but it was a bit spicier than the \"medium\" I imagined it to be, so be aware when deciding your heat level. I wished there was a bit more bok choy though to balance things out. Solid entree, would recommend. Portion was perfectly sized that would leave you comfortably full. 

SERVICE:
It was okay, mostly due to long wait time. Noodlehead is definitely a busy place and the amount of staff is not enough to cater to their volume of customers. Though not painfully slow by any means, it did take a little while to get our napkins, takeout box, and check. Turnover/cleanup was took time. I felt bad just sitting there waiting for our check while the tons of people at the door waiting to be seated had to be patient minutes longer.

Staff was polite and the food came out fast enough though, so kudos! It's not easy feeding large groups of hangry people.

IMPRESSIONS:
Price is absolutely affordable for the quality and quantity of food. I've been here about three times now, and look forward to coming back again. It is cash only, so that's kind of a small annoyance. Plan accordingly...and I hope you think of the infamous sir mix-a-lot song when you order the buns (juicy doubles). Is it playing in your head already? Perfect."}
{"text":"This is not authentic Thai food whatsoever. Do not go to Noodlehead expecting your standard Thai restaurant (by American standards). Not a single Thai person seems to work there - it's mostly very trendy and hip young Americans. This vibes will with the trendy aesthetic of the restaurant. 

Go into Noodlehead expecting Thai/Asian INSPIRED noodle dishes, and you will be able to enjoy it. The Pad See Ew is my favorite. I am disappointed recently by Noodlehead's removal of the fresh spring rolls that you would find at any thai restaurant from their menu. You can only get fried spring rolls now. I also felt surprised by the thick breading that came on the chicken in the street noodle dishes - unappetizing, heavy, and the breading was so thick that it would fall off the chicken far too easily. It also just is not what one typically expects when ordering chicken in a noodle dish (so be wary that it comes thickly breaded!). 

I wouldn't go out of my way to go to Noodlehead because the menu selection is so small (there's maybe 12 menu items, and that inclues appetizers, soups, and entree noodle dishes). Also, it's terribly inconvenient for the following reasons to be aware of:

You cannot use credit cards (though there is an ATM with a $3.00 fee inside).
You cannot make reservations(there is not even a phone to call them on).
You cannot order delivery, or place an order before arriving (again, no phone).
You cannot even put your name on a list to be seated until every member of your party is present (very annoying when you're friend is trying to find parking on a crowded city street).
It is BYOB, but there is a corking fee.

Basically, Noodlehead is a pain to deal with (waiting in long lines, trying to get your name in and getting frustrated that last party member can't park fast enough and the list grows right in front of your eyes, paying to drink the alcohol you already bought, and having few options to choose from and likely not seeing your favorite Thai classics if you like to branch out from pad thai) BUT, if you're interested in an aesthetically pleasing environment to eat some noodles, it's the place."}
{"text":"We stopped by during a road trip through Pittsburgh. The place was packed. Was seated relatively quickly (about a 5 min wait).

Ordered the Sukothai, Chiang Mai, Street Noodle #1, and Kee Mao. We ordered medium spiciness for everything; however, the spiciness of each dish seemed to vary by quite a bit.

The Sukothai was by far the best dish. The lime broth goes really well with the rice noodles, and gives the dish a great kick.
The Chiang Mai had good flavor. It was a curry-based noodle dish, and was a great deal sweeter.
Street noodle #1 was just imho spaghetti noodles with fried chicken cutlets. Nothing special here, I would avoid.
Kee mao is like pad see yew. Very standard, but very tasty. Was also very very spicy.

Ultimately, Noodlehead would be one of those places that I'd keep coming back to for quick and good food if I was a Pittsburgh resident. The dishes themselves taste excellent, but feel more like re-hashes of familiar (and thus comfortable) flavors.

This is all fine and dandy at the end of a long day when cooking is just a chore. If you're looking for something unique and special, however, I'd say to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm somewhat of an expert on Thai Food. By expert, I mean that I eats it and I likes it. Lots.

I was very pleasantly surprised to see Noodlehead pop up and scouted it out for awhile until I got the chance to go. I went on a slow Saturday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised.

The decor is very trendy looking, but the seating is very uncomfortable. It feels like they just rummaged through a bunch of yard sales buying reusable pieces of stuff that they fixed up for the place. I'm not a fan of communal table dining at all, so negative for that as well.

BUT WHO CARES, BECAUSE THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC.

 I've tried the steamed pork buns, the sliced grilled beef, and the love boat soup. All were baseline delish, but the pork buns were the best.

I typically go for the Shangmai curry noodle dish and love creamy richness of the curry, even if spice level 1 is enough to blow my face off. I like my food with spice to it and this place seems to waver between American-hot and Thai-hot. I think it depends on the cook, but I'm pretty sure the spiciness at this place actually enhances the flavor and doesn't just distract you from whatever it is you're supposed to be tasting. 

Tried street noodle #2 and would have liked more sauce with the dish and was unimpressed. It was a big mound of tempura shrimp, a laughable amount of noodles in comparison and a somewhat bland sauce. 

It is a bit annoying that it's a cash only establishment, but I get the need for it. As long as the prices stay low (and they are QUITE low compaired to other thai places in the city, especially for the amount of food you get) I'll deal. 

Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"An always busy restaurant, you can tell the food will be amazing before you even step a foot in the door. Honestly, the pulled pork steam buns are enough of a meal for me (as long as I get 2 orders) but I've ordered the noodles before too and they're fantastic as well.

There's really no way to avoid a crowd whatsoever, so be prepared to wait and have some patience; I promise the food is well worth it.

On rare occasions they've left me waiting/forgotten about me either outside at the tables or at the window bar inside, so I recommend insisting on a table. I've never been forgotten about there (though if a comped drink is more your thing, feel free to sit at those spots)

They're BYOB and have a small charge for it, but no biggie. I also like they have a reusable glass water bottle system. Very environmentally friendly! Also, they are CASH only but have an ATM for your convenience.

I'll keep going back here forever :) the food more than makes up for the long wait times!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and never fails to disappoint. We live in walking distance and come here about once a week. I do wish they took take out deliveries orders over the phone, but oh well.

I always get the sukothai and just upped my spice level to 4. They are always super consistent with the spice level. I love the hard cooked egg in this dish, never over cooked! And the noodles always perfect and not overcooked.

And the pork buns. Oh. My. God. Also a big fan of the chicken appetizer. So perfectly crunchy and delish."}
{"text":"I tried this place out because of a friend's recommendation. I was not blown away, but I wasn't completely bummed (hence 3-stars). I ordered the Street Noodle 1 with tofu prepared as hot as they could make it. It was good, but I wasn't blown away. I will say that they did make it super spicy so big bonus points there... I might this place again as I love love love noodles and Asian cooking. The atmosphere was pretty cool to boot. I guess I was just expecting to be completely blown away and that didn't happen."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this restaurant because it is always packed and everyone raves about it. 

I came here with my girlfriend to get some lunch. They only had the window bar seats open so we agreed to just sit there. We waited for almost 10 minutes for a server to come to take our order. I finally got up because another table opened and I asked the host if we could just sit there. She was hesitant and asked if we had already ordered our food. Which we had not so she let us move to the table. (If I had not gotten up who knows how long it would have been for our order to be taken.)

We sat down and we finally ordered. We got the Dumplings, pork buns and Chiang Mai Noodles. 

The apps came out shortly after we ordered. The dumplings were small and it was not worth the price. The pork buns had great flavor and I would order them again!

The Chiang Mai Noodles were good but not the best curry I've ever had at a Thai restaurant. The portion was reasonable for the price and the flavors were good! I just would have liked more veggies throughout the dish. There were supposed to be mustard greens in the dish but I honestly am not sure if they were even in there because there was so little throughout. I liked the noodles they were cooked well and seemed fresh! 

The menu was very limited. That is sometimes a good thing but in this case I think they could expand the menu a little bit. The service wasn't horrible but it took someone a long time until they noticed that my table needed more water. 

The spicy levels are also true to the description, which I can really appreciate! I would come back to try something else because I'd give them another try. I was just a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. I love the decor, the food, service, lighting, etc. I even like the fact that you can't call to make a reservation - it just added to the allure of it for me. 

I almost always get the Pad Kee Mao (which is amazing) but the Chiang Mai Curry is actually pretty tasty too but just not as filling. 

Highly highly recommend this place - especially during the spring/summer when outdoor seating is available."}
{"text":"Chang mai curry I'm a fan!

Curry is soupier than creamy, which I actually liked with the type of noodles they had. It also made it feel lighter than heavy milk-based curries although its still no salad. Pleasantly surprised on how much I liked it; lots of slurping that I kind of wished I had a bib.

Would come back to try street nudes #1 and #2.

Midday no wait!"}
{"text":"It's hard to imagine an improvement for what this place is.  Hip decor.  Great service.  An insanely generous corkage fee for the BYO policy.  Soups as cheap as $6.  Fresh ingredients.  Delectable pork buns.  I can't think of a single complaint, other than the cash-only policy.  But if being cash-only keeps the prices low, then it's hardly a complaint."}
{"text":"There's only one thing you need to know about (though I'll give you more at no extra charge): PORKBELLY STEAMED BUNS. Sweet mother of all that is right and holy. DELICIOUS! We (the young uns and I) got one order, scarfed it down, then got another. Eyes crossed and drool a'flowed around the table.

But I digress.

Once our rhapsody over the aforementioned treat had waned a bit, we each had noodles of various sorts--one kid had shrimp pad thai, one had street noodles with chicken, and I had street noodles with tempura shrimp. ALL were terrific, satisfying, and deliciously hot on a chilly November afternoon.

Noodlehead is a non-alcohol joint, but has a good selection of cane sugar-sodas (Mexican Coke, Fanta and such) and they keep chilled bottles of water coming. Oh! And they're CASH ONLY (there is an ATM in the back, which I can confirm because I had to use it).

It's a chill, unassuming place that comes without an ounce of pretense. Really enjoyed it and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Noodlehead . . . So good! 

This has to be one of the best value restaurants in all of Pittsburgh. It's a 5 star experience. The inside decor is great with its industrial vibe. I love the inside of the restaurant. It's location in East Liberty is great as well. 

This is a cash only restaurant (ATM is available inside). While this may not be the most convenient thing, it keeps prices down. 

Portion sizes are great and the food is great. I highly recommend the Street Noodle #1. 

I don't have much more to say! Service is quick. Food is delicious. Prices are inexpensive. Quantities are abundant. 

Go to Noodlehead."}
{"text":"Tasty - yep. 
Cheap - yep. 
Awesome decor - yep. 

Can't believe it took me so long to get here. It's very good and very affordable. 

Pro Tip: they've changed their spices (as noted on the menu). ORDER THE SPICE AT A 1. I enjoy a lot of things hot, I got the two and really had a hard time coping with it. 

Still doesn't change the quality and price. It's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Love this place, can get busy but it's worth it. The street noodle #1 is excellent and I'm a fan of the fact that it's a BYOB place. The fact they are cash only can be a little difficult."}
{"text":"Very good and great atmosphere! Highly recommend. Good vegan options. The food is prepared to perfection and ready quickly. 
And for those who love spicy food, this is a great place!"}
{"text":"Cash only. ATM in the back. Street parking free after 6. This small noodle joint is excellent because it is cheap and delicious. The crazy spicy  is significantly more spicy than other Americanized Thai food but did not diminish the flavor. My in laws were chary to go here based off of previous bad interactions with the slow wait staff. They still were not completely swayed from their first impression. It should be known that the seating style is a mix of community tables and private. Also, it is BYOB which saved us some money on our bubbly. Fortunately for me the waitress Maria was very attentive and didn't skip a beat with bringing water for my scorching taste buds.  Not everyone will be pleased but I would definitely give it a shot and try the curry if your not sure what to get. Very lively atmosphere.  Was very satisfied."}
{"text":"Holy... wow... sooooo good! I love Thai Place on Walnut down the street too, but Noodlehead is really freaking good!

At first I was bummed there wasn't Tom Kha soup on the menu, but it turns out that it's fine because the Chaing Mai Curry is like Tom Kha soup filled with delicious noodles and oh so freaking delicious!!! I've had the Street Noodle 1 as well and that was pretty dang delicious too. The Thai fried chicken is yummy!

A note on spiciness - I got a 3 and it was quite warm, but still good. I could probably eat a 4 but would be in pain, so I'm guessing that a 5 is way out of my league. This comes from a SoCal native married to an Indian, so I do spice and I do spice well - meaning, they're serious about their spice, but not crazy about it. But don't underestimate it either. (I'm rambling now, I'll skip to the rest...)

I think what's best is that you can tell that they really devote their time to making GOOD food and I think the limited menu helps with that. The dishes are presented well and are not overly oily.

This would be a great early date location as the ambiance is cool, but not too overbearing. And of course, it's super affordable BYOB - so yay wine!"}
{"text":"Overall: A great restaurant with really yummy food. I recommend the  tofu Kee Mao.

I showed up with a group of nine people and were immediately seated. How rare! The ambiance is simply beautiful and the staff are all very pleasant and helpful. 

I really wish they had more vegetarian/vegan options available. Perhaps they could add a veggie appetizer?"}
{"text":"Found this gem on a Wednesday night after taking our daughter to Children's hospital. We got there around 9 PM and it was still very busy, but we were seated right away. They sat three of us at a table that may have been too small for two people. Our server was not very attentive but that can be easily forgiven for how busy it was. The food... fantastic! It was served quickly and was outstanding. If you are sensitive to spicy food you may want to order a spice level a little lower than you usually would. Make sure to bring cash because that is the only form of payment they accept. There is an ATM on site but why pay the service fee if you don't have to. I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I got the sukothai and it was delicous. The restaurant was all wood decorated. It has a rusty look which I really like."}
{"text":"The place is aesthetically pleasing and food was wonderful. I had the sweet potato samosas and a big noodle dish (I'm. Sure I'll update this with the actual name). Would come here again. Just to warn people though they only take cash."}
{"text":"So glad I came here for lunch. Open seating, a concise menu and efficient service is exactly what I was looking for. Within a minute of sitting down, I was presented with a glass bottle of water and menu. I ordered the pad Thai with tofu, it came out fast and it hit the spot! I wasn't expecting it to be that good but wow. Large serving so I I took it home and enjoyed it again for dinner! I'd love to go back."}
{"text":"Just like everyone else, I really enjoy the pork belly steamed buns for an appetizer. The Chiang Mai Curry is amazing! The place is super cute and trendy. Only downside is cash only."}
{"text":"Been here maybe six or seven times now, and I'm still not tired of it. Their various appetizer options are all delicious (especially the sweet potato triangles), and the pad thai and street noodle dishes can't be beat. I'm yet to have a meal here that I didn't love!"}
{"text":"I usually shy away from Thai cuisine. Yes, there is a reason. I find most Thai restaurants to be completely predictable. Everyone sticks to the same traditional dishes, never daring to lean slightly to the left or right. Quite frankly, I've become bored of it all. 

Noodlehead has given Thai new life. The rustic barnyard decor, the modern take on traditional dishes; Is that green curry linguine? Fried chicken noodles? Yep, this is what creativity looks and tastes like. 

Food:
Pork bun - A warm pillowy soft bun, but rather than pork belly, the chefs have chosen to go with pulled pork. The pickles and cilantro come through just enough to give a perfect balance. I must admit I am never a fan of pulled pork, but I'll eat these all day! 

Chiang Mai curry - the most popular item on the menu, and with good reason. A hefty bowl of noodles, chicken, crispy shallots, yellow curry.... Simply delicious 

Tip: For noodle dishes, you get to choose your heat level. I'd go no higher than medium. You've been warned! 

Noodlehead is a breath of fresh air. This is like your Thai grandmother finding the fountain of millennial youth. Except the cash only policy. I'm sorry, that's older than even your great grandma....."}
{"text":"GET. A. PHONE. I would up this review to 4 stars if they would give people some method of ordering ahead--even online would be great. They're not super slow for carryout (usually less than 30 minutes), but that really defeats the purpose of ordering takeout. I'm not a huge fan of the ambiance here--the tables are set up in a very date-y way, but the restaurant is loud--so takeout is my strong preference.

That said, prices are cheap, portions are generous, and food is pretty good (not better than SBL, but they're serving a different type of Thai), so if I have something to do instead of twiddling my thumbs while waiting, I'll keep going."}
{"text":"I live within walking distance of three Thai places in Berkeley, CA and none of them are even in the same league as Noodlehead. I visited my sister in Pittsburgh last week, and she brought me here, because it is one of her favorite restaurants. I can see why. The food at Noodlehead is outstanding. 

To start with, we shared an order of spring rolls and an order of summer rolls. The spring rolls were crisp and not greasy and were packed with flavor. The summer rolls were fresh and went well with the earthy peanut sauce that accompanied the dish. 

For my main course, I ordered the Street Noodle 1 (rice noodles, fried chicken, bok choy, cilantro) with a spice level of 4 out of 5. Everything about this dish was great. The sauce was really flavorful and very spicy. There was plenty of chicken and bok choy (I feel like noodle dishes at some places have a paucity of meat and veggies and tons of noodles; not the case here). I would highly recommend this dish. 

The service at Noodlehead was really great too. We didn't have to wait long at all for any of our dishes. 

Some other important things about Noodlehead:
-It's BYOB, which is awesome.
-They only take cash. They do have an ATM though. 

If you are looking for great Thai food, you should absolutely check out Noodlehead."}
{"text":"Ordered: Pad Thai - Thai Spicy (Chicken), Steamed Baos, and the Thai Fried Chicken 
as good as advertised for sure, pad Thai had a nice spice to it, kind of sneaks up on you and lingers a bit.  The baos were nice and soft, a bit oily but full of flavor.  Chicken had a nice crunch to it, cooked quickly because the chicken was beat flat, kind of like a mix of chicken fried steak with popcorn chicken."}
{"text":"I'll give it a solid 3 stars.  It's a-ok; not great; not stellar, not bad, either.

Pros:  Price -- 9.00 for pad thai
            Taste -- my pad thai was good 

Cons:  Choices of beverages -- no diet coke, no alcohol (you can bring your own)
             Cash only (there was a sign that there's an ATM on premises)
             Comfort -- our table was way too low for any comfort factor"}
{"text":"Thai food with a fresh and modern atmosphere! I tried this place for the first time with a couple friends as an end-of-the-semester celebration. The moment I stepped into this restaurant, I noticed the minimalist decor with warm lighting, and felt that it bordered the casual-intimate atmosphere. We were seated and given the menu. I've grown accustomed to flipping through endless pages in menus of other Thai restaurants and becoming increasingly frustrated in narrowing down my choices to three dishes, and then narrowing those down to one. Occasionally, I would have to tell my waiter/waitress to come back for me later after the rest of my party had ordered, then still spend several minutes after we devoured our appetizers to decide on my main dish. Thus, I was pleasantly surprised to see such a short menu: four appetizers, two $6 noodle dishes, and eight $9 noodle dishes. For the first time in...ages...I was able to order my meal in my first interaction with the waiter/waitress (cue the confetti and sparklers!).

Most of my friends ordered Chicken Pad Thai with their level of spiciness customized to their liking. I went rogue and ordered Chicken Kee Mao with a medium-level spiciness. The presentation of the food was nothing special, just a delicious heap of noodles and chicken in a bowl. I just cared for the taste, and wow, was it tasty--and, do I dare say, SPICY! The first couple mouthfuls were bearable, but after, my tongue could barely withstand any more insult. While my friends were devouring (i.e. slurping) their noodles, I was gulping down water and cursing my poor excuse of an Asian tongue. Eventually, my friends broke out of their noodle-induced stupor and noticed my half-eaten bowl. Grudgingly, I explained my situation. They tried a bite or two of my dish and they immediately reached for their glasses of water. I let out a sigh of relief, realizing that it was not my tongue playing tricks on me. I tried a bite of their dish and it was delicious!

So, I would have given five stars had my own dish not been overwhelmingly spicy. Well, I suppose I learned my lesson. No pain, no gain...right?

BTW, this restaurant is CASH-only. Also, BYOB, with a $0.50 corking fee per person."}
{"text":"I would really recommend coming here. But if you want to get seated quickly, I would suggest going during off hours because the average wait time could be between 1-2 hours if it is during the usual dining hours. I liked the service and the cheap but good food. I suggest getting the street noodles. Remember to bring cash."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here (a year apart) and I am ready to review! My sister raves about this place for its prices and quality. First off you can't beat the price nothing is over $9!! Don't forget your cash either because it's cash only. Want to make reservations or call for take out? Don't. Because they don't have a phone! lol I think this is what helps keep their price so low. On a Saturday night near gentrified east liberty, this is a nesting place for 20-30 somethings with their BYOBs in hand. Just remember there is a .50 recycling fee per person if you do. We had 5 people and the wait was 30 minutes which wasn't bad. It seemed like people came in waves so it's a luck thing. Btw make sure your whole party is there or forget being seated

We got a nice big table in the center and our waitress was helpful with our questions. The authenticity of the food seemed better than other places. Especially with the heat index. I usually get a 5 but here I got a 2. I usually get fresh spring rolls for appetizer but they only have that in the summer. I am not a fan of the fried ones not because they don't taste good but because I like fresh things :-)

Very simple menu: which makes it easier to pick. I got the chiang mang curry at a level 2. Perfect level of spiciness for an experienced Thai eater. It has a little hint of sweetness as well. People say the portions are huge but I didn't think so. It was perfect. But I can eat ,so it just depends on your appetite. My friend opted for a 3 against the waitress recommendation and she was dying lol so don't get cocky here because the food is pretty spicy.  If you are with 5 or more they add gratuity, and they don't do separate checks. This is always a stop when I visit Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I had to see what the hype was about, and I got two dishes, the Sukothai noodle soup, as well as the street noodles #1. First, the good: the Sukothai noodle soup was good. The broth was flavorful, and the meat was good, but I've had better Sukothai at other places, so this place was just average when it comes to Sukothai. The Street Noodles #1 however, I felt is a sham. This is the easiest dish to make, it's just rice noodles (from prepackaged) that they soaked and fried with soy sauce, anyone can do that! And the thai fried chicken wasn't anything special too, it's just fried with batter but no seasonings or flavor into the batter. This is the easiest dish to make, and I'm so surprised that so many people love it, it's not even that good. This isn't even Thai, Thai food likes to marry sweet, sour, salty, spicy, bitter, all together, whereas this dish just had salty from soy sauce. It's such a basic dish and so cheap to make too that while people think $9 is a good value, I think it's a ripoff considering just how easy and cheap it is to make."}
{"text":"My incredible, awesome wife took me here for my birthday dinner. Massive crowd waiting outside, but they quickly worked through the line and we were seated in approximately 20 minutes. We really enjoyed the steam bun appetizer but were indifferent to the pig wings. Entrees were excellent (Pad Thai, spice 2; Street Noodles #2, spice 3). Look forward to returning and trying other options."}
{"text":"We arrived around 7:30 and were asked to wait around 20 minutes for a table, the place was PACKED on a Saturday night. However, after about 10 minutes we were offered a spot at the window bar and we grabbed it! Here's our overall experience: 

Food: 
     Pulled Pork Belly Steamed Buns [$6 for 2] are amazing, a MUST eat if you come here. The tasty pork is dripping with delicious juices and are topped with cucumber and some cilantro. They are neatly sandwiched between a soft and fluffy white steamed bun. 
Street Noodle #1 [$9 for a huge portion] at a level \"2\" spicy was pretty good, but it brought me to the edge of my spice tolerance! If you have low spice tolerance, I would recommend ordering either level 0 or 1! On the beverage side, they also have Mexican Cola, Sprite, and Fanta and a BYOB option. 

Service:
     Amazing, 10 out of 10. The waiter was attentive and timely! He kept an eye on my iced tea and noticed before I did that it was low and refilled it! My dining companion ordered See Yew [$9] with the Thai Fried Chicken instead of just normal chicken [+$2] but when it came out, it had normal chicken. As soon as we told the waiter, he apologized and gave us a side order of the Thai Fried Chicken with no extra charge. Don't forget this place is cash only though, that's the only thing that bothered me. 

Atmosphere: 
     Casual and chic, there was a rustic feel for the place as the counters and tables were all wood and were paired with metal chairs. The music wasn't too loud that I couldn't have a conversation, and happily it wasn't the Top 40 playlist :) 

Great place for families or a intimate date! I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for a while. I decided to go today by myself since it's right by my apartment. I got the lemongrass honey green tea which was delicious and you get one free refill. I got the pork belly steamed buns which I was really not sure about because it's something I've never ate before but they were delicious I loved them if you like pulled pork you'd like them. Then I got the pad tai level 2 it wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be but the sweetness does off put some of the spicy so next time I'd probably go with a level 3. It is a nice place and the prices of the meals are totally worth it. I will definitely come back and bring my friends!"}
{"text":"We are traveling to Pittsburgh and find this place. We ordered sukuthai soup, street middle 1 and pad Thai. The middle are flavored and very delicious. Price are very good, the most expensive dish is $9.00 but this place is very very nice!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and the soups are very well priced! 

$6.50 for a large bowl of delicious noodle soup? Can't really beat that. However, they only have 2 soup options. We got the love boat and although it says it's in a spicy broth, not the spicy lime broth, it seemed to have a lime flavor as well. For this, we only got the 2 spice level and it was pretty mild. Good flavor and overall a great dish.

We also ordered the $9.50 street noodle #1 with the thai fried chicken. It's a rice noodle dish with a light sauce on it so it doesn't sit heavy or make you feel groggy. It's refreshing and the crunch of the bean sprouts and chicken adds some texture. Again, got the level 2 spice and it was again, pretty mild. 

Lastly, we ordered the $9.50 chiang mai curry. This dish is honestly more like a soup with the amount of curry they give. The curry wasn't super thick but definitely not the same as a clear broth soup. The coconut flavor isn't overpowering like it is at most other places, but it's still there. It comes served with like a crispy, dry noodle on the top. It adds a crunch but is a bit hard to eat since they don't break apart that easy, but there are also the soft egg noodles in the curry itself. It comes with plenty of chicken and it's a very filling dish. I ordered it with a level 4 spice and the heat builds but it's a great kind of heat and flavor that you often find in thai dishes.

Overall, the food was amazing, but their menu isn't that large. The dishes have the traditional thai flavors and it stays true to that and that's probably what causes the menu to be a bit smaller. The seating isn't great. They only have a couple floor-level tables and they seem to be for larger parties, the rest are high-top tables with tall stools. Also, keep in mind that they are CASH ONLY, so make sure you have cash on you, although they say they have an ATM on site for those who need it."}
{"text":"Avoid it if you are in a big group.

They made us wait for an hour and gave us tables at different corners of the room. The staff appeared to have very little idea of how to manage the seating. Since the food wasn't that great (previous visit), we decided to walk out."}
{"text":"I live in a fussy neighborhood. It's difficult to find a simple and inexpensive place to grab a quick meal around here. Luckily, we have Noodlehead (still the Thai place that was already there, now improved). For under $25 bucks, we get two meals (which we always take almost half of home for lunch the next day) of really well made Thai food that happens to be in a BYOB, casual but cool place that's a block away.. in an eastern Pittsburgh neighborhood. If you don't know, the premise itself for that to exist is incredible. 

This place is 4 stars for the food--I'm a loser and am stuck on the pad thai or street noodle #1 (Thai fried chicken!!!), but my +1 always gets something different and has never been unhappy--which is incredible, \"atmosphere\" (it just looks cute), and service. Four stars in one sentence. Sheesh.

The 5th star is for how easily we can get here, get food, and get on with our evening .. or hang out with our (cheeeeap corkage fee'd) bottles. I'm not saying sometimes there isn't a half hour wait. If you're going during typical dinner hours, put your name in, go grab wine at the W&S a block away, and get ready for pounds of noodles."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. I've tried everything on the $9 noodle menu and most, if not all, are definitely worth getting and trying. 

My go-to dishes are: STREET NOODLE 1 OR 2 (depending if you're craving chicken or shrimp), SEE YEW, and KEE MAO. 
The only 2 dishes that I am more wary of getting are the: GREEN CURRY LINGUINI and BEEF NOODLE SOUP. As the former is more on the sweet side; and the latter isn't very special since it tastes like any typical beef noodle soup. 

They raised the spice level and it usually varies a little each visit. I usually get a 2 when I want a little spice, and my spice tolerance isn't bad. 

For appetizers, their THAI FRIED CHICKEN and PORK BELLY STEAMED BUNS are delicious and also worth getting. 

Also, every visit the service doesn't disappoint; they are very friendly and pretty patient. 

Note: CASH ONLY (there's an atm but there is a fee) and there is NO PHONE so it's hard to get in contact with them. 

tldr;
food 5/5
service 5/5
timeliness 5/5
interior 4/5 (on the louder and darker side)"}
{"text":"Solid curry with great eggplant & meh green beans in a well appointed environment with attentive waitstaff. Not bad overall. The only truly strange thing was the banquet seats were sunken in, so I was sitting too low. The level of the table vs the distance of the plate made it weirdly hard to eat my meal without having to drip it across my chest. I ended up picking up my plates and eating as if I were standing over the sink. Weirdest design issue. But hey."}
{"text":"Went to this neighborhood gem last night for the first time. We hit a sweet spot and snagged one of the last empty tables without waiting. By the time our food came there were a couple of parties standing in line for tables - and I understand why. We ordered the pork belly steamed buns. They were amazing.  Rich, flavorful with the perfect balance of sauce and crunch. The bread was fluffy and the pork incredibly tender. Next came our noodle dishes - green curry for my date, tofu pad thai for me. Delicious, we finished it all, along with the bottle of red wine we brought. Yes this place is BYOB and cash only. But this in no way impedes them from filling tables and sending full, happy diners on their way. 

Service was fast and polite. Food was hot and came quickly.  Well worth the reasonable prices. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Arrived for lunch and the place was pretty busy but we did not have to wait for a table.  Service here is very good.  The staff seems very efficient and they are friendly.  We had our fresh spring roll app in about 5 minutes and our noodle bowls in about 10.  Both of our noodle bowls were very flavorful and pretty decent portion too. Their spicy # scale is pretty accurate; ours were ordered at a #3 and it was perfect, just enough to heat you up but not ruin your meal.  Their menu is small but every item sounded delicious.  We will be back to try more.  Really enjoyed the whole experience."}
{"text":"Love the Pad Thai here. Only downside is they are cash only but they have an atm on site."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Went on a Thursday night and the service was really fast; food came soon after we ordered it. Food was amazing as well. Huge portions, easily two meals worth. Great value & amazing food. Highly recommend for anytime you're in the PGH Shadyside area. They don't take credit cards, but do have an ATM if you forgot to bring cash."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I recommend the steamed buns and the chiang mai curry.

Don't forget to BYOB."}
{"text":"Came alone on business. Very nice urban feel decor. Menu is small but nice variety.
Cash Only but everything on the menu is very inexpensive. Excellent place alone or with friends."}
{"text":"As someone who loves exploring new noodle options, Noodlehead was shockingly disappointing. There are plenty of better options in Pittsburgh to choose from, so don't settle unless it's extremely convenient. 

Ambiance: South Highland and the surrounding East End / Shadyside area is always a great place to be, especially without side seating in the summer. The inside is a quirky rustic, which they pull off very well. In general, my biggest qualm (other than the okay food) is that they are cash only. While I do understand, it's incredibly inconvenient. In addition, they don't have a phone so you can't call ahead for Togo orders. I would agree that noodles are best fresh and you should likely enjoy them as soon as possible, it's inconvenient when you live near by and end up waiting 20 minutes in the cold for your order. 

Food: After hearing all the rave, I took my mom to Noodlehead when she came to visit. We enjoyed the outside seating and ordered the Street food #1 and the Pad see Yew at the waitress's recommendation. My mom ended up eating the chicken off the #1 which was good but not supposed to be the main event. 

I'm sure I will inevitably be drug back and hope my opinion changes. Noodlehead has the perfect location and the right food style to be my most frequented near by restaurant (I will just need more cash)."}
{"text":"The food is awesome here.  The restaurant is noisy and crowded and the service is quick and friendly.  Take out is a great option if you want to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"I love Noodlehead; the food, the atmosphere, the decor...everything. For me it's a beginner's guide to Thai food, although I will be the first to admit I know NOTHING about authentic Thai food. It could be spot on original for all I know. What I do know is that it's yummy goodness. I not super big on the soups, but mainly because when I am there I want the Pad Thai; my favorite. Their spicy scale is only 1-5, where I am used to the more normal 1-10, but don't let that confuse you; Their 5 is hothothot! 
I think I have had almost everything there and it's all very good. The pork buns are de-lish, as well as the Thai fried chicken. 
I even love the \"no phone, no credit cards and no reservations\", even though there are times I wish they participated in all three. 

Which brings me to the 'the more you know' portion of our program...
There is no phone. You cannot call for hours, take-out, or reservations, which they don't take anyways. They are cash only. They do not take credit/debit cards, but there is an ATM in the back. 
They are BYOB with a small bottle fee.  I think $.50 or something. I don't drink so I could be off on that number, so please do not quote me. 
The menu is small- a few noodle soups, a few noodles and some appetizers. Not extensive but all good. My favorite part of the menu though is the pricing; everything is $6 or $9. I don't know why I love that so much, but I do. It's another neat aspect of this place. 
There are a few outside tables which fill up fast (as does the restaurant itself). 
Al in all it's a great little neighborhood place with great food, great atmosphere and decently priced. What more can you ask for???"}
{"text":"Good food.  Dark and cold restaurant with snobby servers.  I would get takeout but I wouldn't eat in again."}
{"text":"Amazing Asian inspired food !!
Simple menu and great service !
Highly recommended while staying near the shadyside of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Got the chiang mang curry. It was unbelievable. Hands down best curry I've ever had. The best part was the texture - they combined crunchy and soft noodles. I was in love. The spice levels are a little overwhelming - even a 2 out of 5 was really spicy. Atmosphere and price are great. Try it out!!"}
{"text":"Firstly, those bastardized pork buns are stupid delicious. 

The spicy scale is perfect. BYOB, and there's a wine store right across the bridge. Only inconvenience is that it's cash only.

The food is consistent  and delicious. Price is a pretty good deal. I often leave very full. An excellent take on Thai. If only they had pho....."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed.  Ordered spring rolls, pork dumplings and shrimp pad Thai. The rolls we're great, ingredients fresh and hot. The dumplings were bad. Lukewarm, meatball-sized with a thin veneer of dumpling. Very odd to say the least. The pad Thai was unremarkable. Small shrimp, lacked seasoning, and easily forgotten. I expected much more here since I had heard such great things."}
{"text":"I'm SO PUMPED about Noodlehead! Let's get the high points right out there: tasty, cheap, adorable atmosphere, great service. Oh, and it's a BYO! Woot woot!

I hit this place up on a Sunday evening with 2 friends. I had the Phad See Ew with chicken with 1 star of spiciness (you can order it up to level 5). One thing I noticed right away was the serving size: NORMAL. Like not \"I'm a huge fatso\" size. Just right for one person to actually eat the whole thing and not feel disgustingly overfull. And this is a good thing, because it was DE-LICIOUS, so you are going to eat it all. Very fresh, not drowning in oil, yummy-fabulous. I paired it with the lemongrass honey iced tea which was tart and sweet and crisp. Excellent.

Both of my tablemates had the Chiang Mai Curry with tofu (you can select your meat: chicken, tofu, shrimp) which was also yummy--kind of made me wish I could have ordered both!

The menu is definitely restricted: about 4 appetizers, 3 small noodle plates, and maybe 6 entree sized noodle plates. This makes me happy: I'd much rather see a small menu of excellent food than one that's like an encyclopedia of culinary crap.

I'll definitely be hitting Noodlehead up again: the prices are incredible ($6-$12) and the food is great, so this will easily become a regular on my list!!"}
{"text":"If you like Thai food, you need to try this place. And if you're like me, and don't like Thai food, you'll still have a great experience. Noodlehead was my first experience with Thai food, and even though I've found that I don't care for it, I had a great experience, and would recommend to others. (For those who don't like thai food, I recommend the Spring Rolls and the Thai Fried Chicken). Great quality, great portion, great price. Everything was under $10. The restaurant is BYOB. Our server was great, very friendly. Food came fast, but we waited at least 45 minutes to be seated on a Friday night. I loved the atsmophere- cool and trendy but can also be intimate and romantic. I could see myself going here with family, friends, or a partner. I ordered the street noodle and ordered it at a 2/5 spiciness, and just so you know, it is still SUPER spicy. At each table they have a pitcher of water so you can just serve yourself water and they also have silverware and chopsticks presented in a beautiful way. Very clean and nice."}
{"text":"Amazing ... Food was great. Prices are great... Portions are perfect... Loved the simplicity of the menu. Do about 20 items perfectly rather than 50 terribly.. They nailed it... We loved our meals."}
{"text":"Noodle head is a relic in Pittsburgh. Come for a lively atmosphere (normally bustling with customers), the comfort Thai food that you've been craving, and reasonable prices. I LOVE this place. As a college student, I love cheap, satisfying, quick food and Noodle head checks all the boxes. The pork buns are juicy and flavorful. The chiang mai curry (w/chicken) is delicious. The curry is thick and warm (really hits the spot). My friends normally go with the Pad See Yew (wide noodles) which are well

Note: the spices are SPICY. If you normally can do 3/5 at other Thai restaurants, I recommend going for the 1 or 2 here and ask for spices on the side. CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"Noodlehead would receive a 5-star in my book any day of the week. Hands down the best Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. Menu is small and simple but don't let that fool you , every single dish is packed with so much flavor using the finest, freshest ingredients. Explore all the menu items because each one is impressive-they do not blend together, they are all unique and offer authentic Thai street food at its finest. I have never had a bad meal or bad experience here. The staff is welcoming and service is EXTREMELY quick, you could be out of there in under 30 minutes. Keep in mind they do not have a phone number so no reservations and for takeout you must go to the restaurant to place your order (but like mentioned above, they are extremely quick). I love bringing out-of-town visitors here because I know it's always going to be an enjoyable dining experience with mouthwatering food. BYOB & cash only (ATM located inside the restaurant) make it all the better."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Atmosphere was also very nice.

Food quality fair.  Not sure why all the rave reviews.  

Would not recommend going out of your way to visit restaurant.  Better quality noodles out there."}
{"text":"This place has definitely become a staple to my diet. The food is always delicious and consistent every time. I love the street noodles; they are the perfect comfort food. Be careful with the spice levels, they are very spicy. 

This place is BYOB and cash only, so go prepared. They do have an ATM in the back of the restaurant if you forget cash. 

Only downside is that this restaurant almost always has a wait, so be prepared to wait a little while. They do not take reservations."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Noodlehead quite a few times with mostly positive experiences.  My favorite dish is the Kee Mao which is very tasty although the spiciness seems to vary considerably between visits. The service has also been unpredictable as some waitstaff I've encountered have been friendly and professional whereas others were moody or rushed.  However, the food is very tasty especially considering the price and it is a good shadyside staple."}
{"text":"I love Noodlehead! The Loveboat soup is my favorite thing. The only thing missing was Captain Steubing and the gang on the Lido deck. Tip: no phone and cash only but atm on premisis."}
{"text":"I liked my food and the atmosphere. I like that it's BYOB, but I don't like that it's cash only, join the 21st century!

I ordered a 2 on the spice level and it was perfect. I could definitely taste the heat, but it wasn't overpowering. I also liked that they didn't have an overwhelming amount of options. They have a small menu, but each option will satisfy you flavor and portion size."}
{"text":"We went to Noodlehead the other night as we drove by it and saw some reviews that said it was worth trying...and boy am I glad we did! The meal was really quite good. 

The pork bun appetizer was by FAR the best thing on the menu that we tried. It was soft, sweet, and delicious with some pickles as well. I also had the homemade iced tea which was outstanding. 

As for the main course, we ordered the Love Boat and the Street Noodles with the tempura shrimp. Both were alright. I'd say that the Love Boat was better, but maybe that is because it was a soup versus a noodle dish (you have the option of getting both). I ordered the Street Noodles as a 3 out of 5 spiciness, but it ended up being just a little bit too spicy for my taste.

That all being said, it was just about as good, if not better, than most noodle places in Pittsburgh. They are new, but I'd definitely recommend giving them a shot! I know that I'll be returning many many times to try everything else on the menu (and to get some more pork buns!)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Beautiful restaurant and incredible food. Be aware that it is cash only tho. (ATM in back part of restaurant)."}
{"text":"I previously gave it 4 stars, but 5 is more appropriate.

I still love wide noodles the best, so I ordered Kee Mao, with less salt. Wide noodles had a perfect sweet and salty flavor, and I really liked the cooked basil. My friends ordered See Yew (another wide noodle dish, one I ordered last time), and the Chiang Mai Curry. I tried the curry, and I think I'll come back and get that too. The curry was thick and came with fried egg noodles. 

I wouldn't order the dumplings again though, those were disappointing in taste and size. 

BYOB, at 50 cents a person, confirmed.
Cash only--don't forget."}
{"text":"This place was so good! I highly recommend it it. Buns were delicious and the Kee Mao noodles were on point!"}
{"text":"THe most expenisve dish costs only $9!!! Food came back really quick and was delicious."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. It's homey in the sense that it 'hits the spot\" but couldn't be further from simple when it comes to flavor, presentation, ambiance. The earthy decor is very modern and welcoming. The menu isn't very expansive nor expensive and I was more than happy with the small menu. Less to choose from but each option was tempting. Only potential issue might be that it doesn't have much for vegetarians and substitutions are not allowed. Cash only, they have an ATM in the back. Would go again and again."}
{"text":"Great noodles and the spice level is great.  I love that you can customize and they are true to it.  So many places offer you fire-engine hot that's slightly above tepid, but this is the real deal."}
{"text":"Me and the sister decided at the last minute that we wanted thai food and since east liberty is a great cultural district so I was looking forward to eating here.

They were pretty busy when we first arrived. We were seated right away along with a cork style bottle of water and two glasses. The water had come out of a fridge but for some reason it was rather warm than cold. We ordered our food quickly. Two Pad thai's (shrimp and tofu) and the thai fried chicken. 

The fried chicken was great, very nice crisp to it and the meat was juicy and hot. The chicken comes with a sweet chili sauce for dipping which really complimented it well. Too bad I can't say the same for the pad thai. ALthough it was hot and well cooked it had absolutely no flavor. It wasn't sweet or salty but just tasted like raw noodles and veggies. I had to ask for some chili sauce to give it that sweet flavor I like. 

The service by the way, very very slow. We waited for sauce and food containers for nearly 20 minutes. It's BYOB here which is awesome (BEER & Wine) but i think it has BYOS too (Bring your own service). I hope you have a butler like Niles or Jeffery."}
{"text":"My friends recommended this place for me. So I went to this place with high expectations. I thought this place gonna be my favorite thai street food restaurant, but all I've got is disappointment. The noodles were too sour. It's weird that sukothai noodle come with egg boil!? Also there're no crispy dumpling-four on top of my dish. however, I'll come here again. If it didn't get better, I'll have to say goodbye."}
{"text":"The perfect place for incredibly good, incredibly, cheap, incredibly flavorful food. I love it here. It's on the top of my list of must-see restaurants for friends who come to visit.

I'm a big fan of the Chiang Mai curry! Spice level: 2!

And if you want to experience the best food you will ever eat in your entire life.... get some steam buns. Trust me."}
{"text":"BYOB and great food = you can't go wrong. The choices are limited, but overall great tasting food and nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Easily one of my favorites in Pittsburgh! The food is amazing, prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is relaxing.  ...Did I mention the food is amazing?"}
{"text":"Yummy, flexible and fast for lunch. Great portions and the staff is helpful with the heat. Very good lunch experience on multiple occasions."}
{"text":"One of the nicest noodle and thai places in Pittsburgh. The staff are great and friendly. 

The food is fantastic especially the street noodles. Most of my friends love the Pad Thai but I'm generally not a Phad Thai lover. 

The Pork Belly Steames Buns is a mist try appetizer if you are getting an appetizer.

They ask you for your prefered level of spicyness. If you are generally not a spicy food fan, ask for a zero and ask them to being the spice on the side. Beside the spices, they have a special res spicy sauce that is some what sweet and spicy. Ask for that as well. Its definitely worth it. But, for most people I know a level 2 is just great. Its spicy enough whole you still notice the taste of the ingredients :)

Make sure to go early on Fridays and weekends it can have a great line and especially aince the close early you might have the greatest experience if your are there close to their closing time."}
{"text":"Had a really nice lunch here, and especially enjoyed the BYOB aspect. The service was kind and quick, and the food was perfect. I had the pork buns which were certainly co parable to the taste and quality of Momofuku, and the pad Thai for my entree. The serving size was enough to fill me up and take some home. The establishment was very clean, as well as aesthetically pleasing. I would absolutely come back when I'm in Pittsburgh again!"}
{"text":"Oh Noodlehead, how do I love thee. My gal friends and I used to frequent Noodlehead weekly. Hell, I am still there at least once a month. What I love about Noodlehead is that while the menu is small, every thing that I have had on it is excellent. There is a certain element of comfort that comes with knowing exactly what you are going to order for dinner later, and how it is going to taste. 

The standout dish for me is the chiang mai curry. I can not speak to it's authenticity, but this curry is everything I have ever wanted in a curry. It is creamy from the coconut milk, warm, and the pickled mustard greens add an interesting element. It is a fairly large dish so I always have leftovers to take with me (and when I say leftovers I really mean a few tablespoons of curry). 

My other favorite dish is the Kee Mao which I get with tofu. Their tofu is crispy on the outside and is the perfect texture. It soaks up the spicy basil sauce from the dish. 

The BYOB part is probably my favorite thing about Noodlehead. PS: there is a liquor store nearby in East Liberty right off of Highland Ave."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 6 stars! I really have NOTHING bad to say about this place. A friend of mine who is a Pittsburgh local said this is the BEST place to go for Thai food/noodles so I came. I got the Kee Mao noodles which had: big flat rice noodles, bok choy, spicy chili garlic sauce and I got that with tofu. These were PERFECTION. I asked for them medium spicy and they were exactly what I wanted. the flavors and everything were so good. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe food this amazing is this cheap!  The curry has an excellent flavor even when ordered mild (it's hard to deliver flavor without spice in Thai).  Spice heat is specified on a 0-5 system-  know that the magnitude increases rapidly.  Best bang for the buck I've USD in a long time!"}
{"text":"They should take credit cards and expand. They don't take pre orders or reservations.
They're a bit inconvenient in that regard. You go there to get something quick but if they're busy, you might as well waited for seat!

They need a more efficient system. Period.
Foods good though."}
{"text":"You may remember Noodlehead as a great place: good fried food mixed with good noodles and perfectly spiced.  

If you like your food with spices, I've got bad news for you: they've cut out some of the more expensive ingredients.  Now \"spicy\" means lots of red chili: no flavor.  No fish sauce, no star anise, no traditional Thai spices.

To many of you who order spice level 0, this won't make much of a difference to you, but you may notice a difference in the quality of your fried chicken or shrimp: rather than the higher quality oil they fried in before, they seem to be using canola oil, Crisco, or something similar.  

Noodlehead gets a second star for what they used to be: high quality fusion Thai food.  If they can bring this back, they'll bring back my business: and my positive reviews."}
{"text":"Second time here. I got the Chiang Mai curry and the pulled pork buns. Both items were simply amazing. Highly recommend. Service was great, even for a large party (we had 11 people). Just make sure you get here early, or be prepared to wait. Line was all the way down the street by 7pm! Also cash only!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! The pulled pork belly steam bun appetizer is a fun twist on a classic. The bun is formed into somewhat of a taco shell shape, and the plentiful filling is sweet, savory, and rich all at once. Thinly sliced cucumber pickles on top add a well balanced pop of bright acidity. I tried the Street Noodle #1 as my entree, and it did not disappoint. The Thai fried chicken is coated in a light tempura batter, which I prefer to a heavier, traditional breading. Noodlehead allows you to choose your level of spiciness on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the most mild. If you're familiar with Thai food, you probably know that the culture's idea of \"mild\" is usually much hotter than other cuisines' equivalents, and Noodlehead's scale is pretty on par with that notion. Watch out if you're not a fan of spicy foods.

The place is BYOB and charges a meager $1 corkage fee for opening, pouring, and chilling your booze of choice. Definitely more attractive than some of the $20 fees I've encountered at other establishments. The staff is also quite knowledgeable about celiac disease and is ready and willing to point out gluten free choices on the menu. 

One thing to keep in mind: the restaurant is cash only, so don't forget to hit an ATM on the way."}
{"text":"Cash Only!!! Food is absolutely amazing, and even better that it's affordable. Always my go to for noodles in Pgh. Pad Thai is my favorite, just watch out for the spice level it can get pretty hot.

Get in early, the wait can get long and feel free to BYOB!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! We went for a Sat dinner and had the Pork Belly Steamed Buns, Kee Mao with Chicken and See Yaw with Shrimp. The food was fresh and flavorful and with just right amount of spice. I could of made a meal out of the Pork Belly Buns alone.
Our server was friendly and efficient and gave us good direction on spice levels, which I appreciate because it can be tricky to know what level to order. 
The restaurant has an upbeat vibe and there is a diverse crowd, it is not quiet and there is a good sound track playing in the background.
Some notes, it does get crowded and you may have to wait, so plan accordingly. They are also BYOB and there is only a .50 recycle fee. Wine is so expensive in restaurants, this allows you to bring your own bottle and with the food being so reasonably priced makes this a very affordable meal. Last note, they only take cash, but they have an ATM on premises."}
{"text":"Noodlehead used to be, hands down, my favorite Thai spot in the city.  I feel like the quality of the food here has gone down since it first opened.  I typically love the Chiang Mai noodles here, but last time I was here I found them to be underwhelming. The chicken was not super fresh (taste like it hadn't fully thawed from being frozen) and the dish was a little salty for my tastes.

In the past, I have also enjoyed the Sukothai, Love Boat, Beef Soup, and Pad Thai here before and thought they were all decent.  I hope that my latest Chiang Mai experience was a fluke, because there are many other great aspects of Noodlehead. One of the main features is that the prices are totally reasonable ($9 for a big portion).

The atmosphere is nice as well.  It's super roomy and spacious, and the decor is a mix of elegant and modern and eclectic.  There's a kind of nature-y theme with lots of wood and plants, some eclectic lights and furnishings.  Service has always been at least satisfactory, and often above-and-beyond.

Remember they are cash only, BYOB, and don't serve dessert.  But their corkage (\"recycling\") fee is only 50 cents!"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype surrounding Noodlehead. It's OKAY, but nothing super special. The decor was great and they were quick about making the food. My friend and I both had Street Noodles #1--me at spicy 1 and her at spicy 3. I found that the description on the menu was misleading as spicy 1 was VERY spicy. The spice factor probably varies depending on who makes it, but the first few bites were like a mouth fire. The chicken was good quality, white meat breast but the breading was soggy, which isn't my preference. It was still tasty and a good comfort food fried chicken. Noodles were your standard pad thai flavors (even if this isn't the case, that's how the dish tasted to me) of fish sauce, kaffir limes, etc. I thought the portion was generous and I'd go back if I were in the area, but you can get the same thing (maybe with sauteed chicken instead of fried) from any Thai restaurant in town. I found it very pretentious that they don't have a phone and are cash only. To top it off, they charge a fee for takeout (0.35 per item) without telling you about it (I noticed it on my receipt after the fact). I'm going down a negative path here, but I don't hate Noodlehead; I just wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Was here last week with a few friends.  We had 5 of the 7 appetizers to try.  We decided we didn't like the veggie roll.  One described it as tasting like the smell of a funeral home.  I had to agree.  :)  All the others were good.  Noodle #1 and #2 were delicious.  Need to try more dishes to love it.  Was very loud a super busy for a Wednesday evening.  The wait was to take 35 minutes but only took 10.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"When I first walked into this restaurant, I was pretty concerned -- the place looked hypermodern, hip, and just screamed \"I spend way too much time on my looks and not nearly enough on my food\".  Fortunately for me, that impression was way off; Noodlehead serves up a small but incredibly competent menu of some of the most authentic Thai noodle dishes I've had in Pittsburgh.  Color me pleasantly surprised!

Unlike most Asian places I've been to in Pittsburgh, Noodlehead knows its core competency, nails it, and never apologizes for it.  This is a welcome change -- most supposedly Asian restaurants in the area don't (at least in my humble judgment) seem to *have* a core competency to speak of (or are very confused about what said competency is, to say the least).  At Noodlehead, it's noodles, noodles, and more noodles.  The menu is so limited that it could comfortably fit on a 3-by-5 index card -- and every single item is worth eating.

My favorite is the Kee Mao (at other Thai restaurants, you'll find it called 'Drunken Noodle', 'Drunkard Noodle', etc.).  The veggies are fresh, the wide noodles are just right, and the seasoning is heavenly -- as good as any I've had elsewhere.  I also like how their spice scale is actually useful: I find the 5/5 spicy indeed, the 4/5 a distinct step down, and so forth.  And, since THIS!  IS!  PITTSBURGH!, the portions are (a) served on dishes the size of hubcaps and (b) absolutely enormous.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best.Fried.Chicken.And.Curry.Ever.
I got medium spicy and it was perfect. Got that good spicy runny nose action. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"First time here. Among southeast Asian food my favorite is Thai and this 20 min walk definitely paid off. I got the Chiang Mai curry noodle and shared an appetizer of pulled pork belly steam bun with a friend. 

First the bun. It first seemed a little over-priced for 2 buns that aren't even medium sized. But after I tried it the mutual complaint vanished. IT WAS PERFECT. I would describe it as \"every single bite is a new experience\". The crispiness of cucumber, soft texture of the pork and the exactly perfect thickness of bun. Also it was a little juicy! This dish was just artistic. 

The noodle was pretty good, but the buns definitely pulled up my standards. Taste of the curry was refreshing, but not so special. Quality of noodles was good. Very good portion. 

Nice environment. As long as it's not the first date (I never believe spicy/hot noodle is appropriate for the first date as it can get a little messy), definitely great place for dating."}
{"text":"See yew is my favorite!! If it could be paired with the fried chicken as one set, I will have to visit noodlehead every day!!!"}
{"text":"My parents were recently in town and when asked where they want to eat they asked for that \"noodle\" place the wife and I always talk about. We went over for a late lunch (3pm) and waited about 10mins. Somehow I have never waited more than 10mins, but I have never tried to get a large group wedged into the small dining room. I also have not scoffed at sitting at the bar overlooking the street.
The dining room is dimly lit, plants and modest decor. The seats are mainly uncomfortable, but I guess that's intended, seeing as they want you to slurp your noodles and surrender your seat to the next person in line. 
And now onto the food. $9 for a generous portion of awesome noodles with chicken, shrimp, or tofu. Should be all you need, but incase you're slow. The sauces are very well done. A balancing act of sweet, sour, spicy, and salty. This balancing act is often attempted as South East Asian food is a similar melting pot as is America. They also mix in fresh veggies which are perfectly cooked. 
The spice can be ramped up to 5 which I have not yet braved as 4 is perfect for me. My parents were a little taken by a 2 though and my wife who is Korean and enjoys spice was not happy with a choice of a 3 once.
Judge for yourself. $12 with tip is as cheap as it gets."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time reading yelp reviews for Noodlehead. This place is amazing and the best thai restaurant in Pittsburgh, just go!

Limited menu shows that they focus on their best dishes. 

Get the chiang mai curry"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh. You can't beat the prices (nothing on the menu is more than $9!) and BYOB is a huge plus! 

The atmosphere is awesome. Very cool and rustic looking. They don't take reservations or credit cards, but it's well worth the wait!

Definitely get the steamed pork buns! And my favorite noodle dish is the curry chicken!"}
{"text":"This is such a delicious laid-back restaurant! The food is phenomenal and affordable.  

You MUST get the steamed pork buns. They are fluffy pillows of goodness.

Pros:

-Great atmosphere
-Speedy service ( received an appetizer and our meal within 10 minutes of sitting down at our table)
-YUMMY food
-easy to street park outside
-outside seating in warmer months
-BYOB with ONLY A 50 cent cork fee- you actually can't beat it
-tables large enough for big groups 
-bathrooms are clean
-your food is steaming hot every single time 
-I've always seen children here eating the food so I imagine they have good child options

Neutral:

-They take their spice seriously
-it is a smaller building but I think this helps them give great service and fresh food
-CASH ONLY

Cons:

-No reservations
-Long wait times when you go at peak times



My boyfriend and I like to go in the afternoon for lunch and we NEVER wait to sit down. Occasionally we have gone for dinner and while there are long wait lines, they allow you to begin drinking your wine while you wait AND it is totally worth it. As you can tell I'm pretty obsessed with this place. It is so yummy! TRY IT!"}
{"text":"As a Thai person who has spent 10+ years of her life eating street food from many different regions of Thailand, I think Noodlehead is fantastic. I have been here way more often than I should, but it is so so worth it in terms price and quality. Though on a sweeter, Americanized side, it is as close to authentic as it gets in PGH. Still not convinced? Here's THE testimonial: I once took my Thai mother, who is a phenomenal cook and 10x pickier than I am, to this established and she *strongly* approved. 

As for the spice levels, if you absolutely cannot handle spicy, ask for a 1 or even a 0 - my soul hurts saying this. After years of eating painfully spicy food, my capsaicin receptors have been desensitized to the point where a 2 won't do it for me, so I typically go for a 3 or a 4 if I feel like challenging myself. 

Recipe for a happy life: go there, get their pork belly steamed buns (DO IT), try any of their somewhat underrated $6 noodle soups or their more popular $9 noodles, pay/tip them (cash only), and walk out a happy man/woman."}
{"text":"This is an excellent noodle spot in the Shadyside area of Pittsburgh. The restaurant is cash only but don't let that deter you from making the trip. The pork buns shown below are one of the must-try items. The noodles are phenomenal however the spice rating is for real. Would recommend getting 1 level below what you think as you can always add spice and not take away."}
{"text":"Ambiance is great, very trendy, but be prepared for a long wait. 

The food is ok, the noodles came topped with fried wanton strips which really weirded me out, but other than that the food was good. Their scale of spicyness is a little deceiving though. I got the Love Boat which already has a spicy base, so that's probably my fault, then said \"medium\" when they asked how spicy I wanted it (although my dinner mates said theirs were spicier than they expected too). So if you're not too into spicy, go for like... a 1. I like spicy, but it was still too much for me."}
{"text":"Really good noodles at a decent price. I wish they took credit cards. I also wish they had a more diverse array of spice condiments."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is great and I'm so happy to see better Asian food in Pittsburgh. 

The restaurant had great decorations and we loved the vibe. We went on a Saturday night so it was packed and it took awhile for us to get seated, so try to go at times where it's not as crowded. 

The food is delicious! We were starving but didn't have to worry because the service was super fast.  We had food in no time. I got the Chiang Mai curry which was soooo good. There's also a hotness scale so if you don't like spicy food, you don't have to worry!

Just to be aware, make sure everyone in your party is there because we didn't know that. They sat us down but when they realized everyone wasn't there they made us get back up, so just making everyone aware to have their whole party there."}
{"text":"Really awesome. Portions can be smaller so be aware when choosing your lunch! 

Went when it was super slow. Food was delicious, service was nice. Really loved the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Only place I go for noodles now.  Open late till 10 pm everyday.  Cash only, they have no telephone and first come first served.

I like the pad se ew noodles best.  The flat rice noodles are always cooked just right with flavor.  I wish they had a beef option; you can only choose from tofu, chicken or shrimp.  I recommend the shrimp as I did not like the chicken as much.  The tofu is okay.

Also, the better half likes the street noodle #2.  The tempura shrimp and thin noodles have just enough zing with the small pool of fish sauce on the bottom on the noodles.  

Two things I ask for:  level 1 spice and add scallions.   The level 1 spice is just right whereas 2 is getting to the point you have to drink water as you eat, it really builds up!

After the meal, Millie's Ice Cream is next door if you please."}
{"text":"Had the pig wings for appetizer and the See Yew and Chiang Mai curry for entree. The pig wings were pretty good, but could have been a little more tender. For 6.50 you only get three small pork ribs, probably won't end up getting it again.

The curry was good and so good with the crispy noodles layered on top. The See Yew is also good, very traditional and would try again. 

The kitchen staff look like Thai so that's a good sign for Thai food. They don't accept credit cards and I never carry cash but luckily I had enough to cover the bill so BRING CASH. 

Service is excellent, low light ambience setting, clean, and modern. Price is very fair. Popular among the college scene and busy as well. I definitely will come back to try their other dishes. Also, BYOB with 50 cent recycle charges."}
{"text":"Not one bad thing to say about this place. Every single thing on the menu is amazing. You must however, try the Pork Belly Steamed Buns. I always get the Beef Noodle Soup - spice 4. Pad Thai is a go to, as well. Everything can be vegetarian too. Be careful that if you don't like spicy to only get a 1 because authentic Thai food tends to run on the spicy side. Great vibe and atmosphere as well and all the staff is extremely nice, approachable and accommodating!
Also, it can get pretty packed with a long wait during peak hours, so just know that their takeout is just as good as in the restaurant. I'm all about the takeout!"}
{"text":"This is a great new sport my husband and I went to randomly when everything else around had long waits.

The atmosphere was nice. Great design and theme but it was very cold and drafty every time the door opened. 

We had the pig wings which were just okay. The sauce was good but overwhelming and it was really small considering they were two bucks a pop. Came with a homemade pickle salad that tasted like taking a shot of vinegar... I love anything picked and this was unbearable.

The Chiang mai curry was outstanding. Nice mix of coconut milk and spice. The noodles were crunchy on top and a nice way to soak up the coconut milk curry soup in the bowl. I got a spice level 2 and it was perfect, it was the right kick of heat without having me reach for a drink every bite. 

My husband had the noodle #1 at a level 4 heat so I didn't even try... way too spicy for me. I did have the chicken on top which was not spiced and everyone's review is right-it's well with it for the amazing chicken. Chicken was nice and juicy and had a great crunchy coating.

This is a great spot to try something new. Not too expensive, byob with $5 fee per person. But it's cash only so be advised. They do have an ATM. I just think with all the apps out there they can get it together and accept cards... just a peeve of mine."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Small menu, but everything I have had is on point. Don't forget to BYOB."}
{"text":"I went here on my last visit to Pittsburgh with two friends and was blown away by how amazing this restaurant was.  While it took a bit to adjust to the unique seating situation once we found a spot we quickly got to work figuring out what all we wanted to try.  My dining companions decided to share the steamed pork rolls - which were apparently phenomenal - while I went straight for the main entree.
While I was saddened by the lack of vegetarian options under snacks the dinner options make up for that as you can pick between shrimp, chicken, or tofu.  I decided to go for the Kee Mao as I'm on a bit of a bok choy blitz and decided to go midway spice wise.  WOW did this dish have heat!  From the first bite I was smitten - this is how spicy food should taste, not overpowering tongue on fire but gradual and building so that you can savor the dish.  The bok choy was cooked perfectly, greens and whites, as were the noodles creating the perfect combination of crunch and slurp.   The portion was also on the large size which was a pleasant surprise given how affodable this place is.  
I can't wait to visit Pittsburgh again and will most certainly be heading back to Noodlehead.  Fingers crossed they will add some more vegetarian options to the menu or at least be willing to accomodate minor subs as I would love to try the Chiang Mai Curry!"}
{"text":"It was all right, nothing so fantastic.  Ordered the steamed pork dumpling appetizer.  Unfortunately, they were kind of blandish and not very seasoned, relying instead on the salty sweet sauce to pour over.  I left 2 of the 4 on the plate.  Also got the beef pho, which included bok choy and bean sprouts.  Okay, maybe I am not used to the proportions, but there were SO many chunks of beef, had to take it home, could not finish this meat-heavy portion.  The rice noodles were the thinnest I've encountered.  There was very little actual veggie in the soup, which I would have liked.  Felt like the proportions were out of what meat to veg, but this is a meat-heavy town.  The broth was heavy and had a hint of sweet.  At first blush, was tasty, then realized the flat complexity of flavors.  Anyway, a great place for those on a budget, busy busy place.  Overall, I was a bit disappointed, maybe ordered the wrong stuff."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT! First word that comes to mind when I think of Noodlehead. Fantastic food, awesome atmosphere and superb service. I couldn't have asked for a better experience my second time coming. Oddly enough, we sat in the same exact hi-top as the first time we visited. The results were the same if not better. 

The pork dumplings were served what seemed like seconds after we ordered and were hot and steamy. Order one of the noodles (Pad Thai is everyone's favorite but I suggest See Yew). The spicy meter is spot on (1-5, 5 being the spiciest). 

Best part about Noodlehead, BYOB and no corkage fee!"}
{"text":"Really fantastic + BYOB. They have so many great options and almost all can be made byob. Spice is serious so say what you actually can eat (it is customizable)"}
{"text":"Don't know why it took me so long to eat here. I must walk by a couple of times a week. Well, today we had lunch here and it was fantastic.  Fried chicken was a perfect appetizer for two, and I had the beef soup \"Love Boat\", which was also hearty and delicious and more than enough for lunch. 

A note of caution, if you order something hot (3) it's like a seven or eight on a traditional Asian spiciness scale.  Service was a non-issue, they were not very busy yet, but everyone we spoke to was very friendly and courteous. 

Can't wait to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Everything on the small menu was excellent. The pork belly appetizers were amazing. The noodle dishes were delectable. The ambiance was hip. Can't go wrong for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh for a quick bite.  I love Street Noodle 1.  They don't accept take out orders by phone, so you have to go in if you want takeout, but they are super fast!  BYOB and cash only."}
{"text":"The pork buns are alllllllllllll the rave!!!! Bun was super soft and the pork was absolutely delicious. I was totally confused at why it was leaking sooooooooo much oil but nonetheless, I ate all of it because it was goooood. 

I should have stuck to just the buns because I hated my dish and so did my nephew. We were not sure how serious to take the pepper scale and ended up hating the food because it was toooooooooo spicy and we couldn't even figure out what we were eating.  

womp womp womp womp (insert sad face)

Our server was annoyingly hasty, until she saw that I checked into Yelp!! Ha"}
{"text":"Great, consistent, quick Thai style noodles! My go-to noodle place if I'm in the mood for something tasty and spicy (which is almost always). My favorite dishes are easily the Street Noodle 1, the Chiang Mai Curry, and the Pad See Eew, but just about everything that I've had off the menu has been extraordinary. The fried chicken cutlet on the Street Noodle 1 is 80% of the reason why I order it so often, it's amazingly crispy and juicy, the perfect accompaniment to the spicy, saucy, rice noodles. My favorite part about the Pad See Eew is they actually a few noodles with the wok flame which caramelizes a bit of the sauce right onto the noodles. This technique elevates the dish to the next level and is about as authentic as it gets. My newfound favorite, the Chiang Mai Curry, is a Panang red curry bottomed out with egg noodles, chicken, and topped with a crispy egg noodle nest. The flavors are incredible and will leave you happy and full each time. The crispy egg noodle nest is my favorite part since the texture contrast with the rest of the dish will keep you coming back for more.

Their spice scale is on a 1-5 but they don't mess around with the heat - 5 never looked so intimidating. However, I'll typically get a 3/5 if I want to enjoy the spice, 4/5 if I want to feel alive, and a 5/5 if I want to sweat it out at the table and make others think I just finished a 5K. 

As others have mentioned, Noodlehead does not have a phone, so you have to place take out orders in person, but you won't be waiting any longer than 15 minutes for your food despite how busy they are. They are also a cash only establishment, but there is an ATM located inside for your convenience, and they do not take reservations. On weekends, be prepared to wait in a long queue during peak hours, but the wait is definitely worth it. Despite these minor inconveniences, the food speaks for itself and Noodlehead has become a Thai noodle titan in the heart of Shadyside, and mine."}
{"text":"Although Pittsburgh has its fair share of Thai eateries, Noodlehead is hands down my FAVORITE. With friendly employees and fast service, eating here is always a pleasure! Some of my favorites include the See Yew noodles with tofu and the Chiang Mai curry, which also allows for a tofu substitution instead of chicken. The See Yew strikes a balance between saucy noodles and vegetables, while the Chiang Mai successfully delivers a flavorful curry sauce with subtle hints of coconut. Furthermore, the addition of the Green Curry Linguine to the menu is a welcome change for guests who want a sharper, less sweet curry. The Kee Mao also is delicious and is less sweet than the See Yew. Honestly, I could go on and on with my praise for Noodlehead's food!

Some things to note: this is a BYOB restaurant, with a wine and spirits store right down the street! Additionally, it is cash only (ATM in the back) and reservations are not accepted, so wait times can get long on Friday or Saturday nights or with large parties. However, the food is more than worth the wait.

Afterwards, be sure to stop by Millie's ice cream next door for some desert :)"}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend and I have never had anything like it. It was amazing food. They don't do any substitutions except tofu and they only have about 10 things on the menu, but that means they do it right!"}
{"text":"5 stars. We decided to eat outside because it was such a nice day. The staff always had two large carafes on our table with water. My Thai friend ordered the Sukothai, and was very satisfied. I ordered the street noodles #1, pork belly buns, sweet and spicy pig wings, and the Thai fried chicken. I would highly recommend each of the aforementioned dishes. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"\"FEATURING TASTY NOODLE DISHES FROM THE STREET MARKETS OF THAILAND!\"  is what Noodlehead's website blazes.  Had a Friday evening dinner recently with a group of 6 to celebrate one of who had been visiting and working with us  for six months from Thailand.  She is returning to Thailand next week.  We were surprised when she wanted Thai food for her farewell dinner back to Thailand, but later she told us this food tastes nothing like the street food in Thailand (so much for the website claim).  However, if it's good enough for someone from Thailand to choose it for a farewell dinner, it's probably pretty good.

Parking is absolutely terrible around this area of Highland Ave.  At least it's relatively safe as you're walking to your car 4 blocks away.  Arriving at 5:40pm, the  small space (seats about 50 by my estimation) was already completely full.  Pittsburghers do like to eat early.  Noodlehead has an annoying but well documented policy that they won't seat you until your entire group is present.  Although some of our group members were late, there wasn't anywhere for us to sit until 30 minutes anyway.  Noodlehead is BYOB (50 cents/person corkage), so no drinks while you're waiting (and this is not the kind of place that will call you while you grab a drink down the street).

The menu is basic American-Thai fare.  There's just a few appetizers like pork belly steamed buns and Thai fried chicken.  There's a variety of noodle dishes like Pad Thai and \"Street Noodle.\"  As other's have mentioned, for most of the dishes you pick a spice level from 1 to 5.  1 is clear your sinuses, slightly runny nose hot so be very careful unless you're used to this kind of thing (our Thai friend ordered a 5).  You'll have a better meal and avoid next-day unpleasantness.  

Everything was tasty, but no better or worse than any other Thai place that I've been to in Pittsburgh.  

The service was fast and friendly.  By the time we got up to leave, the crowd waiting was staggering.  More people were waiting than there were seats in the restaurant.  Noodlehead's good, but with the hideous parking situation, the long wait for a table, and the overall standard cuisine, I don't understand the popularity of this particular establishment."}
{"text":"I'm lowering the rating I gave noodlehead because over the course of my last two to three meals there my experience has gotten consistently worse. 
The last couple times we noticed the spice level was all over the place. In the past if you ordered a three you could guarantee it'd be hot. The last time I went there was hardly any spice. Given that the spice level is one of the main ways you customize your dish it lessens the quality of the meal and experience. We discussed this with friends and they too noticed that the spice levels seems to be inconsistent now. Because I ordered a three and got a 0-1 I sent the meal back. It came out remade at the correct spice level. However, the dish appeared MUCH more watery than usual and there was an eyelash on one of the shrimp!!! I chose to pick that shrimp out and eat the meal because I was really hungry. Over the course of a couple months I went from recommending noodlehead to everyone, to never wanting to eat there again."}
{"text":"People have a tendency to lean toward food trends.  Bacon is a prime example, with recent reports of an imminent bacon shortage in the coming years due to worldwide excessive consumption... that, or we can just blame Randolph and Mortimer Duke for their shady dealings in pork bellies.  So for now, while the supply is still here, I highly recommend the pork belly steam buns.  Simple in nature, complex in flavor.  A crispy exterior with a slightly caramelized Thai glaze gives way to the delicate, rich fattiness of the interior complimented by thinly sliced pickled cucumbers and a sprig of cilantro - all of this wrapped in the warm embrace of a pillowy handmade steam bun.  Imagine if you could eat a warm nap on a crisp autumn night (no really, imagine it)... this is what should pop into your mind.

What people fail to realize is that there are many parts of the pig that can lend that same salty, succulent, tender pork fat that the human mind/body ultimately crave.  Trotters, shoulders, tongue, jowl (which yields a personal favorite, guanciale)... it's gold, Jerry, GOLD!  For those of us that are well aware of these parts, we can only hope that there is no bacon shortage... because if there is, the wannabe food lovers will start coming after the real tasty bits, and that just spells disaster for those that can appreciate the intricacies of flavor and texture spread across the landscape of a freshly slaughtered hog.  For those that want to preserve the porkfat, so to speak, one of the great alternatives is the \"pig wing.\"  The item is not new, but the description is something that caters to that of the typical food illiterate.  It is nothing more than the shank - a simple and widely used item in cuisines around the world... but when prepared correctly, it is transformed into a tender, hot pork popsicle with a built in stick.  The glaze is reminiscent of the aforementioned pork belly, crisp on the outside and lending a higher meat ratio, yet still interlaced with just enough gelatinized fat to leave that little bit of tackiness on the inside of your mouth - something dentists should find a way to harness, because let's face it... it'd be a lot more enjoyable if you have a sticky, slimy coating of pork flavor rather than the grittiness from fluoride covering your tongue when you're walking out of his office.

The Street Noodle #2 features fresh shrimp cooked to just beyond the point of translucency to maintain its natural texture and sweet flavor, accentuated by a light tempura batter that provided a blanket around each shrimp so to absorb the sweet and (mildly) spicy sauce.  Lightly saut√©ed bok choy was able to maintain a pleasant crunch, while still lending a bit of bitterness to create a harmonious flavor with the sauce.  

As with most Thai places, I was excited to see an incremental chart describing the varying heat one may choose.  Unfortunately, my expectations were not met.  The level 4 was described as \"thai hot\", so naturally, I ordered a level 5 \"crazy hot\".  If going by a 5 point scale, my level 5 should have been in the 1.5 - 2 range.  I can understand not many people can tolerate extreme heat, but if you're going to have a chart, make it valid.  I want tear inducing, sinus clearing, face in a bucket of hot tar kind of heat... not a few chili flakes that would make your grandmother tear up.

Service was what it should have been, and I can appreciate the \"no substitutions\" on the menu.  Every now and then you have to trust the chef.  It's the only way to experience other people's passion for food.

First impressions are the ones that stick, and Noodlehead stamped a respectable one in the bottom of my stomach."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is fantastic!  I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review! 

I typically get Street Noodles #1 - however, I've tried pad thai, See Yew and Street Noodles #2.  All of which are fantastic.  

4 things to note about Noodlehead:  
1.  BYOB - bring a bottle of wine, a growler, something yummy to share for those over 21. 
2.  Cash only!  However they have an ATM available in the restaurant to get cash - nice and easy! 
3.  First come first serve with seating - they do not take reservations.
4.  Parking on Highland can be iffy.  Don't park in the whole foods parking lot.  I haven't experienced it - but they WILL tow your car.  I always say it's a \"sign\" that I am supposed to get Noodlehead take out when I drive past on my way home from work and there is a parking space open.  (Score for me!)

Back to the food - Pork Belly Steam buns - get them.  Devour them.  Love them.

Get to noodlehead.  The staff is great, the food is amazing, and the atmosphere is superb."}
{"text":"I love Noodlehead.

Not only is it tasty Thai noodles at a cheap price (and BYOB!), but the decor is so cute and the resulting atmosphere is great. Seems a bit hipster-y, but fun. I want to take every guest who comes to visit me here, and so far, I have! The only thing I wish is that it had other Thai dishes also! But what they do have is done pretty well.

Solid place for an introduction to Pittsburgh. (Oh and PS: Cash only -- don't forget!)"}
{"text":"Trendy and classy spot. Food is fabulous! Quick and friendly service. The pad Thai is amazing. And the Thai fried chicken is really good too. Haven't tried the soups but will certainly be back to try to again. I have been here quite a few times and it has never been a disappointment."}
{"text":"I'm a super fan of Thai food. Love this place, really good Thai cuisine, and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence. It's good, but not great.

The atmosphere is cool. We like the vibe and the outside seating in the summer. However, the food is somewhat pricey, and as I'm comparing it to our other Thai favorites, the food is not really better. Only the ambiance is superior.

My daughter loves the pad Thai, and I like the See Ew, but we can get those dishes at other places. Nothing special. Bloomfield delivers the goods better plus you can get a great curry dish to go with it!

My husband likes Street Noodles #1. I couldn't eat the fried chicken part (gluten allergy), but I tried the sauce, I have to agree that it rocked."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is one of my favorite restaurants in Shadyside. The menu only has a handful of appetizers and 10 main dishes-making it easy (for someone like me who can never choose) to decide what to order! 

I would highly recommend the Pad Thai - the restaurant will cater to your spiciness level (if you want to go for a challenge you can ask for a level 6, which is the hottest!). The Pork Belly Steamed Buns are a favorite of mine as well for an appetizer. 

The restaurant is BYOB and cash only. They do have an ATM in the back of he restaurant. Noodlehead does not have a public phone number and therefore, you are unable to make a reservation or place an order for takeout over the phone. If you do, however, decide to take out, you can order at the hostess desk and your meal will be ready in less than ten minutes. 

This is a great spot for lunch or dinner with friends, family or a date!"}
{"text":"This was my first byob restaurant, It was pretty fun getting to take a bottle of wine and sharing with everyone at the table. Even though we had to wait for a table they kept our wine behind the counter so we didn't have to carry it around shady side. 
The server was nice and very helpful for those of us who have never eaten Thai! 
We had spring rolls and pork steam buns as an app, they were delicious! Part of me wanted more spring rolls just for my dinner. But, I'm here to try the noodles right! 
I had the See Yew with shrimp. I tried the zero level of heat but got some on the side to add myself. It was very yummy! I also added a lot of the spice and woah, I loved it!  My husband had the same dish with chicken, he loved it as well!! 
Did I mention how this place is not crazy expensive either? Double score!"}
{"text":"I love Thai and the fact that this place is BYO is fantabulous.  Not only that, it was the first restaurant that hubby and I hit up after moving to the 'Burgh. 

This most recent visit was not as eventful, but it sure was tasty!! I usually tend to go for the Pad Thai, but this time I went for the See Yew. This dish had egg, broccoli, chicken, big ol' rice noodles all on some tasty black sweet soy sauce. Boy, let me tell ya this was delightful!! I had a taste of the Chiang Mai Curry, which was good, but a little too spicy for my taste. 

Either way you can't go wrong with this place. The price is right, the decor on point, and the service was outstanding. The servers had great suggestions which helped me a fair bit since I don't like spicy food. Overall great experience and would come back again!"}
{"text":"I am a BIG fan of noodlehead. Everything I've tried off the menu has been delicious but I must say that the classic Pad Thai is my favorite. Keep in mind that they are cash only and they do not have a phone so you cannot call your order in ahead for pickup. I try to avoid going at peak times because they can develop quite the wait. However, they are well worth the wait. They have a spicy scale from 1-5. But beware! They take their spice levels very seriously. I consider myself a fan of spicy food and I can handle a 2 at the most. Definitely give noodlehead a try if you haven't been yet. It's my favorite place to get Thai food."}
{"text":"Our waiter was great at recommending choices. The spice level was hotter than most but perfect for me. Our apps and main bowls were piping hot, fresh, and came out super fast. The music was unique and very diverse; and, the decor was very welcoming. I would classify my meal as the best Thai in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Comfort food that is not too comfortable or too basic. Attractive space with good view of the street. Staff is very prompt and attentive. Chilled bottles of tap water and utensils in bins on the table speed the meal without being rushed or hurried. Nice mix of patrons. Can be crowded at dinner but if you come early or a little late there is no fuss. Bring cash as credit cards are not accepted. Prices  manageable and never a heartbreak. Recommend pad Thai or kee mau."}
{"text":"I would give Noodlehead 3.5 stars. We came around 8:30 on a Friday night and the wait was 45 minutes to an hour. We ended up getting seated around 50 minutes later. Since the menu is not too big, we ordered quickly. I had the Kee Mao with tofu, spice level of 2. 

Overall the noodles were cooked well and it was a hearty portion. I just did not think they were anything special. They are definitely good for only $9, but I was expecting a little more flavor. My friend got the Chiang Mai Curry and she said it was delicious but needed more noodles. She ended up having a lot of the curry leftover. Overall, a decent meal but not worth an hour wait."}
{"text":"Wow what a wonderful place!!  The Sukhothai soup was to die for! Pork meatballs were delicious and broth was delicious. Fast service and great food!!"}
{"text":"I really like the noodles, especially the Pad See Ew and I usually get this. I'm not used to eating spicy food so I appreciate that they actually offer 0 spiciness level."}
{"text":"My love for Noodlehead has grown. I am partial to the Chiang Mai Curry with tofu - but nothing on this menu will disappoint. I love the interior and I love that though they are wildly popular, they have kept their smaller location because it's so perfect and charming - it fits the vibes. Come for noodles - leave happy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in the city. Don't forget to stop for cash along the way, they are cash only. I love the sticky buns and sometimes am tempted to just order 4 plates of them. The street noodles are delicious. The atmosphere is nice and calm and service is always good. BYOB and a nice assortment of table sizes so good for small or slightly bigger parties."}
{"text":"First and foremost this restaurant is neatly situated in the heart of ShadySide and easy to get to no matter what part of the city your coming from.  Parking may be a little bit of a pain on the weekends but it's worth the little walk if you park a couple blocks away. 
Secondly, the ambiance nice and not to classy where you feel out of place.  I can walk in under dressed and fit right in.  It's just under 1200 sq feet I think but conveniently laid out to accompany all size parties.   With 3 decent size tables out front on the sidewalk, it's a plus when they get slammed and have a line going down the sidewalk.
Third, the staff is always warm and welcoming.  They probably have a huge staff because every time I come in, I always meet someone new.  They are also very knowledgable of the menu and can help first timers order.  Just be careful with the Spicy/Hotness scale. It goes from 1 being mild to 5 which is their hottest.  I can eat spicy food and 2 is pushing the limit for me.
Lastly, the food...simply amazing no matter what you order.  Being a world traveler and having eaten in just about every Asian country, this spot is one to contend with.   I absolutely love and must have the pulled pork buns every time I visit.  It reminds me of how Peeking Duck is served but only with ridiculously moist and soft pulled pork wrapped in cloudy white bun.  My other favorites are the Sokutai and Chang Mai Curry noodles, each with its own special ties to Asia.
In conclusion, when in Pittsburgh you have to visit this spot!  Why anyone would give it anything less than 4 stars is besides me....Very well done Noodle Head!"}
{"text":"Best Thai noodle restaurant in Pittsburgh. The prices are great and the meals are consistently delicious"}
{"text":"Great, cheap, filling food!

The ambiance - mix of rustic and modern.  Very loud.  I would come here with friends since it doesn't really scream romantic.

The food - Great!  I had the slow-cooked beef noodle dish.  The beef was tender, the beef broth had great flavor and the noodles were cooked nicely.  Next time I'll try something with a thicker noodle.  

Vegans/Vegetarians - The Pad Thai can be made vegan with tofu and without egg.  My girlfriend really enjoyed this dish and we were both so stuffed that we were unable to finish our plates.

The price - For 2 big plates of food our bill only came to $19!  Please be aware: they only take cash.

If I'm craving a big, warm, filling bowl of food then I will be coming here."}
{"text":"The bad: uncomfortable seating 

The good: amazing food. Ordered level 4 and added hot sauce as needed. I must have burned off my taste buds...and liked every moment."}
{"text":"Damn you, noodlehead. I am now 100% in love and obsessed with Street Noodles #1. 

I've been twice in a month and will be back this weekend. 

So, they come off as slightly pretentious because they don't take cash, they don't have a telephone, and you cannot alter any meal..... That being said, with their meals being $9 bucks and the BYOB charge of a mere 50 cents, they're okay in my book. Ha. 

The place itself has a really cool vibe. Modern with tons of different textures. A couple really cool seating options for larger parties (like a picnic table and whiskey barrel seats). 

Definitely plan on a 20 minute wait, on average. They do have an ATM on site now. 

I've gotten the SN #1 both times with a spice level of 1 or 2, and they were perfect. Friends have gotten the pad thai and green curry linguini with a spice level 3 and he was sweating, haha. 

New favorite place!!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork buns are my favorite!! So delicious-- perfect blend of sweet and savory and not too heavy."}
{"text":"Cash only, super affordable, BYOB with a low corking fee, and SO YUMMY. Casual but still feels fancy. I eat here at least once a month."}
{"text":"The steamed pork belly buns are a must. I also had the love boat with a spice level of three and it was delicious. The menu features fresh foods and the atmosphere is welcoming. The service is quick, but manages to not make you feel rushed.

The menu is short, which I love. A lot of restaurants have way too many options... But I appreciate it when I don't have to take 20 minutes to read over the menu. It can be very overwhelming sometimes to have to choose between a significant amount of menu items.

It's BYOB which is also another plus. I'm a poor college student so finding byob places helps to not break the bank."}
{"text":"Awesome meal!  The menu is small (maybe 10-12 dishes) but the food is great.  I had the street noodles with crispy chicken and can't wait to go back and have it again.  We went on a Thursday night , did not have to wait for a table and had great service.  Would go again - for sure!!"}
{"text":"Great flavor, price and location. Pulled pork steam buns are to die for.

Service is super quick. We always get served within 10-15 mins.

Also, BYOB with 50cent recycling fee.

Cash only but they do have an arm inside."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place.   The food was delicious.  We got the pork buns very good as was the Thai chicken.   I ordered the pad Thai it was excellent.  The staff was outstanding.  Very attentive.  Some of the best service.    Only downside. Parking is very limited on the street but worth the walk to eat here."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, things you should note:
1) no credit cards
2) no reservations
3) no phones
4) NO RICE. 

But the food still makes it worth going to. Chiang mai curry is the best ever. Avoid Saturday nights, went with a group of 5 and they said \"we may not be able to seat you tonight\" bc it was that packed. Not even mad about it. Don't forget it's BYOB, and entrees are only $6-9."}
{"text":"I went here a couple of weeks ago on a Sunday night with 2 other people. We ordered the pork buns and sweet and spicy pork wings, both of which were very tasty. For our main dishes, we had the chiang mai curry (spicy level 3), kee mao (spicy level 2), and the love boat (spicy level 2). Again, all three were delicious, although the spiciness level of the chiang mai curry didn't seem to compare with the other two dishes, even though we ordered it with a hotter spiciness level.

So, why the 1 star review? Half way through our meal, one of my dining companions found a paper clip in the chiang mai curry. The response we received when we reported the paper clip to the staff? Nope, not a \"We're sorry because that's really disgusting and you could've choked on that,\" but rather \"That's funny because we don't have any paper clips in the kitchen.\" What a ridiculous and unnecessary comment! As if we carry paper clips in our pocket to put in our food to avoid paying for a frickin' $9 bowl of noodles! The dish ended up being removed from our bill, but the accusatory tone the Noodlehead staff took left a very poor taste in our mouths.

Bottom line: Good food. Disgustingly poor customer service. It's really a shame."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Great great great food, friendly and cool atmosphere.  I had the \"love boat\" and steamed buns. Marvelous. \"Pig wings\" and \"street noodles #2\" excellent. Rush out and go to Noodlehead. And it's BYOB!  A real gem."}
{"text":"Well made Thai dishes that are quick to arrive and flavorful. Sweet Potato Triangles were new [to me] and excellent. I had the Kee Mao noodles (big flat rice noodles, bok choy, spicy chili garlic sauce) with shrimp, spice level 3/5. S.O. had the Green Curry Linguine (semolina noodles, ocean clams, basil), also spice level 3/5. The spice variance between the two dishes was night and day. The Green Curry was perfectly spiced and the coconut cream probably did a good job to temper the heat. The Kee Mao was almost unbearably over spiced--I wouldn't have been able to finish without regular trips to my S.O.'s dish (coconut cream) to tamp the heat down. Cash only (ATM on site) and BYOB (plus a deposit of 50¬¢ per person) might stiffle a few patrons but I imagine that's how they keep their prices low."}
{"text":"I love Noodlehead! The food and service is consistently good. My friend and I always go here for delicious weekday dinners. The music is good and atmosphere relaxing. My friend always orders the Street Noodle #2 which she loves. Tonight I had the Pad Thai with shrimp. It was tasty but nothing special. I always order spicy level 1 which to me is spicy enough! The food always arrives quickly. Cash only and BYOB."}
{"text":"I took my little sister here for her birthday dinner and we were very very impressed! I loved the rustic/reclaimed decor and the service was impeccable! 

We started off with the Lemongrass Honey Iced Green Tea which was very delicious and refreshing. Then we shared the pork dumplings and each choose the beef soup option. The flavors were so yummy and portions perfect. Out the door we spent about $40 including a generous tip. This place is cash only but here are multiple ATM machine options both when you park and at the restaurant. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been back a handful of times since my initial review and can confidently bump Noodlehead to four stars as I was hoping to do so. After making sure that there is no cilantro in my dishes things have been peachy keen.

For snacks, I always order the pork belly steam buns (there are two). Two just aren't enough and you'll be wanting more. Thai fried chicken is another one of those salty satisfying bites too. The garlic-nam pla chicken (quantity of four) was tasty as well and had a sweet savory dipping sauce though I prefer the thai fried chicken. Be careful as they are extremely hot straight out from the kitchen!

Green curry linguine is heavier than some of the other dishes but great flavor there too. I was surprised though that the clams were in little chopped pieces as oppose to being whole. I was wondering where they were then realized they were about the size of a peppercorn.

Also if you order Kee Mao with shrimp they definitely don't skimp on that. Fried shrimp overload!

I do wish though that there were more veggies overall in their dishes.

Noodlehead has become a staple on my list!"}
{"text":"I would actually give this 3.5 stars. Although it was very good, it just didn't live up to the hype. The pork buns were worth 5 stars. The crispy veggie spring rolls were just your garden variety greasy egg roll. Will try the fresh garden roll next time. The noodles were just good, nothing super special. We found out they don't even make them in house, which was quite a letdown. I will try it again b/c there are other things on the menu that are intriguing. If I'm not more impressed next time then I would just go for the pork buns. Also we went around 4 pm on a Saturday so there was no wait. I certainly would not stand in line for this one."}
{"text":"Love this place! I was repeatedly recommended this place by coworkers who know what's up and finally got the chance to come out all the way to Shadyside to experience this yumminess. I am a noodle lover and expert so here's my 2 cents on this restaurant:

1 star taken off for cash only. Not even debit cards here. The menu and the website both call this out so I was at least forewarned. No parking either. That is a bit of a problem but we drove around a few side streets before finding an alley. 

Okay, so the quality of the food. A+! I ordered the Street Noodle #2 and the hubby ordered the Chang Mai Curry. The street noodles were the exact textured Hong Kong style thin egg noodles that I crave 24/7. The sauce and the tempura shrimp were perfect too. I got the 0 spicy level but had them bring the chili flakes on the side. That's how I roll. I like to control my own spice level. The portion of mine was rather small for $9. I agree with some of the other reviewers that they should throw in more noodles b/c I started eyeing my husband's dish...

The atmosphere was crowded but hip. The tables were super clean and not wobbly. I would definitely come back here to try the other menu items. It's comparable to Lulu's Noodles from the Carnegie Mellon area but there are many things I like about Lulu's more, I think."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and efficient. Food was delicious and we were able to find food for our kids, 6 and 7. Only negative was cash only."}
{"text":"Delicious.  I always enjoy the food from here. I just wish they had a phone number for take out."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is one of my FAVORITE Thai food places. You can't get spicy anywhere else like they do here. I think I usually get a 3-4 and I love spicy. Definitely go in knowing your spice tolerance.

I'm a huge fan of the flat noodles, so I always get Kee Mow or Pad See Yew. It's always very flavorful, and the spiciness never drowns out the flavor. They give very generous portions and don't skimp out on the meat. Their vegetables are cooked well, just the right amount of crunch. This place is also very affordable, only $9 per noodle dish! I usually take home leftovers for a second meal, unless I'm starving that day.

The interior is really chill and it's a great place to bring a date or grab a meal with friends. It's also cash only, and BYOB. 

The unfortunate thing is that getting here can be a pain without a car. (71B comes only so often). Furthermore, this place can get really popular and I've had to wait 30-45 minutes here more than once. Also, they don't have a lot of variety in dishes. It's mostly just dry noodles, soupy noodles, and some appetizers. 

Anyways, come here if you love spicy food, thai noodles, great prices, and awesome environments/service."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!  I don't make out to this side of town much but if I could I'd dine there weekly!!

The price is perfect. Quality of food is super fresh. Limited style menu with no substitutions makes for consistency and less mistakes. 

My selection was street noodles #1 with heat of #1: my Thai style chicken was a bit over cooked and it had strong fish taste, so strong I did not think it was chicken. Small disappointment. The noodles and sauce were delicious. Maybe a bit too much fish sauce there as well. But I loved the all over flavor and heat. Just a small hint of heat. Perfect. My husband ordered street noodles #2 with heat #1. His was a bit more spicier than mine. The shrimp-meh...  small tempura shrimp-over cooked. Noodles were great with sauce.  

Atmosphere: quaintly dark modern. 

I dined at lunch. Doors open at noon. I got there 1:00. They were at almost at max capacity. We got a small two seat in the front corner near the window. Perfect seat. Definitely best seat in the place. Anyhow, they were busy. They handle busy well. Waitress was very calm and professional. Our order came out promptly. Hot. Fresh. 

Even though there were a few small hiccups I will be back!!  Absolutely love the menu and can't wait to try everything!!!"}
{"text":"The flavors here are Thai, and Pittsburgh does some of the best Thai in America.  The place isn't super-cheap, and it's cash only, which is rust-belt retarded.  I've tried the steamed buns and the chiang mai noodles.  Those buns were good as good as any bao I've had anywhere else.  The chiang mai noodles - noodles drowning in an excellent coconut curry - were also very good.  

But there are other Thai joints in Pittsburgh with curries just as good (or better) at the same price, like the Smiling Banana Leaf, whose curries usually contain huge chunks of flavorful vegetables accompanied by rice instead of noodles.  Plus the the other Thai places smile upon their customers by giving them more payment options, like plastic."}
{"text":"I adore Noodlehead! The combination of the great food and the vibrant, casual atmosphere is what draws me back here again and again. I also love that it is BYOB and good for large parties. The dishes are consistently yummy and satisfying! I brought my boyfriend here last night for his first time! In terms of Thai noodle dishes, he's only had the privilege of trying my sad homemade Pad Thai. Needless to say, he was blown away with his Pad Thai dish at Noodlehead! I love the Street Noodle #2 which is a little lighter and tangier than Pad Thai. It's one of my favorite dishes. I also love that Sriracha sauce lives in each table. My boyfriend picked up at 6-pack of Troeg's Nugget Nectar from a nearby bottle shop. You just can't go wrong with beer and noodles!"}
{"text":"We had the kee mao (level 3), thai chicken, steamed pork buns, and the very best flavored tea I may have ever had. All were cooked perfectly and so delicious. The food came out quick and was enough for two to easily split. 

Though parking is sometimes a challenge, and its cash only (atm is on site), it is totally worth it. Food is amazing, quick, and fresh; everyone is friendly; cute atmosphere with some outdoor seating; honestly a great meal!!"}
{"text":"I stopped over here for a light bite because I was headed to an event down the street. I was seated fairly quickly. The waitress came over and told me this place is strictly cash only. They do have an ATM on site if need be.

She told me that the noodle portions were quite generous so I decided to stick with two small appetizers and chat with a few folks around me over their selections.  They serve all types of noodle dishes including noodle soup with the only substitution being tofu for whatever meat or seafood on it.

I ordered the crispy veggie spring rolls and the sweet potato triangles. I got two spring rolls with a sauce and about six sweet potatoes with a cut up cucumber based sauce. You have your choice of silverware or chop sticks if you wish to try your hand at that. I enjoyed both appetizers and was glad they were not overly filling.

One of the persons I chatted with ordered the Kee Mao with chicken. This dish includes flat rice noodles, bok choy, basil, and spicy chili sauce. She loved it and told me it was her go to meal whenever she comes here. Another person I spoke to had the pulled pork belly steam buns. He told me it was his favorite appetizer.

I was impressed with the menu because it even notes your choice of spice level. The menu is clearcut and straight forward. 

This place definitely will be on my return bucket list to try out one of their noodle dishes. The place fills up quickly so it is best to get there early."}
{"text":"stopped here for a quick bite while visiting pittsburgh--our food actually tasted excellent, but my partner's chicken dish made him extremely sick and he spent the entire rest of our trip in bed!! that was the first dish we'd eaten out all week as the rest of our food so far that trip we'd packed; we were certain he'd gotten food poisoning was from this restaurant's chicken. the whole rest of the trip was spent in bed which was EXTREMELY disappointing. We went to call the restaurant on our way out of town only to find that they dont provide a phone number! We understand things happen and cooks/servers often have no way of knowing if food is contaminated--but please beware!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The Devore is so warm and welcoming along with an amazing fresh  floral display that greets you as you walk in. 
This was my first visit to Noodlehead, was immediately greeted by hostess when I walked in. Was asked to step aside while I waited for my co worker to join me for lunch. I selected a few of the snack items and the iced honey tea. The sweet potato triangles were perfectly deep friend with a flaky texture. The vegetable rolls were just as tasty and fresh, can't wait to return when I have more time to try a noodle dish."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I have the hardest time convincing my bf to get thai food but he loved it here and I definitely agree.

We ordered the steamed pork buns which were the perfect texture - the buns were soft and kind of chewy, the meat tender and well flavored with cucumber.

I ordered the Chiang Mai curry which was amazing! Really good texture to the noodles, the spices were on point and the chicken and veggies were perfectly done. The presentation is also nice. 

My bf ordered the shrimp street noodles. The tempura coating was crunchy and not too oily - perfect. The sauce/base was also very very good on this dish."}
{"text":"The interior of Noodlehead was different from most Thai places that I have experienced. There were no visible statues for devotion, bright orange paint or elephants on display. It was more of a bustling, bar like atmosphere. They did not serve alcohol and offered BYOB. The food was excellent. The pork buns were delicious as well as street noodles 1. The Chiang Mai curry was also a great dish. The staff and patrons were all very friendly even after we told them we were from Cleveland."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is amazing! the restaurant has a great atmosphere to sit down and eat with friends, but always good for take out too (usually a 5-10 min wait). Pad Thai is beyond delicious, it's BYOB and they even have some outdoor seating. Service is also great. 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"Started off with the Pork Belly Buns which were perfect. Just the right amount of smoky sweetness and a hint of heat.  

Also had the Chaing Mai Curry. It was to die for. First of all it was a huge serving. Second,  it was just delicious.  So many nuances of different flavors. This was one of those dishes where I could have licked the bowl. And spicy just enough.

Also had an extra hot Ginger Beer.  If you've never tried, try it.

Great service too.  And we got to sit outside on a beautiful day."}
{"text":"When I walked into this place the decor and the lighting that entered through the windows really gave it a great atmosphere. There were a lot of tables which gave me the impression that it was excellent in food as well. 

For appetizers we ordered the pork buns and the pig wings. Both were delicious. There aren't many places in pittsburgh that serve pork buns so this was a wonderful find. The buns weren't too soggy or too fluffy but the perfect size. The pig wings are actually like a chicken wing but made with pork and marinated with flavoring- also very delicious. 

Disappointed- For the main dish I ordered the street #1 because a lot of yelp users have left good comments and mouth watering pictures. But to my disappointment it was WAY too salty. It was difficult to finish the dish at all. The dish comes with deep fried chicken that gets soggy pretty quickly from the sauce. I gave this place 3 stars for their modern decor and their appetizers. If I come back and try another noodle dish I may change my ratings. One thing I do want to try next time is their BYOB."}
{"text":"Love this place! It has a small menu but the food is amazing. I always get an order of the pork buns. You can't beat the price of this place either."}
{"text":"Well, they went and fixed the menu to have vegetarian appetizers, and also allowing tofu substitution on most of the dishes. So, they went and earned the 5th star.
I really like this place. It is a great interior, good service, the food is consistent and fast, and everything is priced so reasonably. Plus, you can't beat BYOB."}
{"text":"The love boat is really good. The thai chicken side is okay, but the dipping sauce is kind of bland and it was only kind of warm when they served it."}
{"text":"SO good. BYOB. They do charge per bottle for recycling. I love the Chiang Mai Curry and the Pad See Yew"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and they have reasonable prices. I also recommended this restaurant to my other co-workers who are also going to pay this restaurant a visit."}
{"text":"I can only agree with my fellow Yelpers - Noodlehead is one of a kind! The menu won't overwhelm you but they focus on the basics and they get it just right. 
We tried the See Yew with big, soft rice noodles, a very tasty sweet sauce, and your choice of shrimp or chicken. The flavor was fantastic and very distinguished. The other dish was Chiang Mai Curry with egg noodles, chicken, and some vegetables in a superb coconut sauce. The portions were decently sized and will fill you (if you're super hungry take a starter). The spiciness level ranges from 1 to 5 - I took 2 and it was already well spiced. Prices are okay-ish, $9 for a main dish. The food quality is great though and that's why I'll definitely come back here again.

Street parking can be tough on South Highland and - it's cash only."}
{"text":"I have probably been here about 5 times over the past few years, the most recent time being this past weekend. I was really impressed on my first visit by the interior of the restaurant. It's very unique and still looks as though it just recently opened.

The menu is fairly straightforward. I appreciate places that keep things simple, as opposed having menus that are the length of a short book. Variety is good, but you have to draw the line somewhere!

The pork belly steamed buns are an absolute must. Tender shredded pork topped with a small amount of pickled cucumber that adds a nice texture and flavor. The buns themselves are fluffy and delicious. You get two in a serving... don't split this with anyone because you will DEFINITELY want more than one. I don't want to even think about how many of these I could probably eat if given the challenge.

I've had a few noodle dishes and enjoyed them all, but on my most recent trip I had the pad thai with chicken. They take spice pretty seriously here, so I ordered a two out of five. I could have probably gone to a three but it was still fairly spicy. The portion was also pretty generous and I ended up taking leftovers for lunch the next day.

The only downside, as many have mentioned, is that they don't take credit cards. Kind of annoying as I am one of those people who rarely carries much cash, but it's worth it for this place."}
{"text":"A byo with steamed buns clearly made from doughy angel wings...melt in your mouth, eyes-rolling-into-the-back-of-your-head kind of wonderful. The Chinese Fried Chicken is street comfort food and the spice scale is generous, so go easy, tiger. Noodlehead is consistent, cheap, crazy flavorful and offers a no-frills kind of deliciousness. Mexican Coke is a bonus, for sure. In a neighborhood full of ethnic options, Noodlehead is my go-to."}
{"text":"I read the good reviews so I had to check it out myself. I got the Kee Mao medium and it was so good. Better than any Thai noodle dish I've had before. When I come back to Pittsburgh I will have to get my Noodlehead fix."}
{"text":"Oh my, this brought me right back to Hong Kong! Amazing food - pork buns, fried chicken, and Noodle Plate numero 2. Not pricey either and it had a great environment. We especially loved snooping the blind date that was next to us. 15 minute wait for 2 right around 7:00 pm on a weekday. Will go back - just pls start accepting credit cards :)"}
{"text":"Noodlehead is worth the 5 stars, hands down. I've been here a handful of times over the past 6 months and the food is delicious....Thai street noodles all the way. I'm not going to write a novel, so I'll spare you the over-indulgent rant on every single aspect. I think they may need to consider more seating at some point because it's always slammed. For the most part I generally get good servers here who are knowledgeable and pleasant. Beware: they are cash only."}
{"text":"This place is adorable and delicious. I had the Chiang Mai Curry and it was so flavorful and spicy. The texture of the pickled greens and shallots was really wonderful and unique. I ate as much as I could, took the rest home, and excitedly ate more of it later in the evening when I was hungry again. 

The decor is really beautiful. Kind of organic/industrial/modern with an Asian twist? My only complaint is the number of stools without backs. I know, they look cool, but I want to sit in a real chair, not a poof or decorative stool."}
{"text":"Fantastic noodle joint! Friends loved the pork belly buns & the see yew noodles were awesome (tip: the shrimp was better than the chicken!) Add in that's it's a BYOB & this makes for a reasonable night out!"}
{"text":"Kind of weird this place doesn't have a phone, doesn't accept card, or take reservations. But the food here is absolutely amazing! I think I've had pretty much everything on the menu (not that extensive) and everything has been very satisfying. Beware when picking your spiciness level though, I think this place is spicier than typical Thai restaurants. Its a cute little place with an excellent vibe to it! On weekends dinner can get a bit crowded and there is no way to tell the wait, but theres a lot to do/walk around Shadyside while you're waiting. Food comes out really fast at this place which is really nice!"}
{"text":"O frequent Noodlehead nearly every week. I've learned, if you go at night when they are busy, you will get horrible service. 

I was in on Saturday with 4 other friends. We waited over 30 minutes for a table. The hostess, a pregnant brunette, thought she was doing us a favor by pushing two tables together. That would have been fine, but one of the tables was small and round. So all 5 of us didn't really fit.  We had just ordered when a large table opened up. When I politely asked the hostess if we could move, she was rude...wagged her finger at us and said, \"oh no no...these people have been waiting\". Ok, so had we. And they could have taken our table. 

The dinner service was also slow and the server didn't even speak to us. Thankfully, the food was good as usual. 
Lesson leaned. Avoid NH during dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent meal.  I got the green curry, set to '10'.  Came out red--when I asked why, he said, 'peppers'.  It was hot.  

Wife got a yellow curry.  Also excellent.  Really like the noodle choices.  

Best part was the pork buns.  Yum !"}
{"text":"Noodlehead is a go to for some tasty Thai food at a good price. I've always gone with the pad see ew, either with tofu or shrimp, but the Chiangmai curry is also very delicious as well! All of the appetizers that I've tried have been yummy as well (spring rolls, sweet potato triangles and pork bun). My only gripe with Noodlehead is that some of the servers that I've had have not been very friendly/attentive, and they don't have a phone for take out (which really makes absolutely no sense to me)."}
{"text":"This place is great if you don't mind BYOB and love thai food. Service is usually good. Sometimes a wait on evenings - especially on the weekends. Cash only. Love the vibe- great pad thai."}
{"text":"Stopped by Sunday around lunch time. Sat outside under the awning, which was super nice. We ordered the sweet and spicy pork wing appetizer, which was bone-in pork shank. They were really tender and came with marinated cucumber, which complemented the pork really well. The flavor was a little muted, but I would still order them again. For the meals, I ordered the street noodles #2 (shrimp tempura and thin noodles) and my boyfriend ordered the street noodles #1 (fried chicken with pad thai style nooodles). The sauces tasted extremely similar if not the same, which was fine because it had a nice spicy flavor. We requested a medium level of spicy and my mouth was on fire by the end- beware! The tempura dipped in the leftover noodle sauce was my favorite part of the meal. The crispiness balanced the spicy very well. I wouldn't recommend these dishes if you think you'll have leftovers. They don't travel very well! Finally, the service was great. We asked our waitress for recommendations (as we do at most places--you would be surprised at how many servers this question trips up!). She gave great recommendations and was helpful!"}
{"text":"Hanging out with friends and family. It has simple decor but the food is exceptional. Homemade noodles add extra flavor to their Thai dishes. Pork buns make the best appetizer.  BYOB keeps the price low. Serve is very fast."}
{"text":"I love this place, but sometimes, especially if it's a busy time of the day, the dishes aren't their best. 

However, the pork belly steamed buns are always on point."}
{"text":"A friend and I came into Noodlehead tonight after hearing rave reviews from other friends and, as many cold winter nights approach the Burgh,  it may be my new favorite place in Shadyside.  We shared the Sweet & Spicy Pig Wings to start, which were a bit spicy, a bit sweet, very tender, and finished with cilantro and green onions.  Delicious.  Next, at the suggestion of our server, I had the Slow Cooked Beef.  Again, delicious.  The broth was sweet and extremely flavorful.  There was garlic, spice, and cilantro in addition to the tender cubes of beef in every bite.  I ordered it to be a 3 and was happy with the spice although I am admittedly a bit of a wuss.  My friend had the Sukothai and Loveboat and was pleased with both.  She thought that the dishes could use more spice (and she ordered them at a 5) but she's pretty hard core.  I can't wait to go back to Noodlehead to try everything that I didn't have on the menu.  It's inexpensive, delicious, and $0.50/person for BYOB."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend from out of town. We both agreed Noodlehead was the right move! The food is quality, atmosphere is modern, prices are fair, and the service is fast!! We ordered the spring rolls (not pictured) and I got the traditional Pad Thai rice noodles. This place is cash only (usually an indicator of a great noodle joint). I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day.  

The wait time was a bit long, but overall it was a nice afternoon and it ended up being ok. 

We shared the order of pork buns, though high priced for two buns they were delicious and well made.  We also had the Chiang Mai Curry noodles at a 5 spice level which was delicious and I was eating the sauce with a spoon! We also shared the pad thai.  It was delicious, but paled in comparison to the other noodle dish. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yea....so between our group of just four people we literally ordered almost every noodle dish on the menu....

I'm so sorry/not sorry people waitin in line ;) but we had to...

Great food! I would def come here as my first stop when I'm back in the Pittsburgh area"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I had the green curry linguini with clam and the pork belly sliders. They were both fantastic, sophisticated flavors and high quality ingredients. This is my favorite Thai food in Pittsburgh. They mean what they say about the spice level--I got a 3/5 and it was actually spicy, which was enjoyable."}
{"text":"What a change a remodel can make to the atmosphere! I was pleasantly surprised walking in here. Gone is the stuffy atmosphere and in it's place is a fresh and funky scene. I loved the modern take with lots of dark colors that make it feel intimate and cozy. With some good alt rock jams flowing through the place, I was into this place before I even got the meal!

The menu is very simple with only a handful of choices. Not being an expert, I picked the thing that looked best to me, the Street Noodles #2 which was fried shrimp, bok choy and chili sauce for $9. I was happy to see plenty of crispy, fluffy fried shrimp. I was not happy to see how small the dish was for $9. Maybe it's my big American appetite getting the best of me, but i thought it was kinda small. Plus, for $9 I expected more. I think dropping it to $7.50 and keeping the size of the dish would be perfect. Or maybe tossing in more noodles and keeping it at $9. Spicy factor, just right for my lame non-spicy loving palate. Well, I love it, but I cry. It just gets messy, trust me!

I like the fact that they have Boylans soda, because I love me some Boylan's Cream Soda! Plus, it's BYOB, so you can grab your fave bottle of vino to enjoy with your noodles. But remember to also grab the cash, because it's CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Wow where do I start with this street style Americanized Thai restaurant?? We came in here while visiting Pittsburgh and we didn't leave disappointed. The first time was a bit of a bit we knew that as we arrived on a Saturday around 8:00pm. It's a cash only spot and they also don't have a telephone in the place. 

Once we were seated we were given a thing of water and the waiter came shortly after. We ordered the Thai crispy chicken and pulled pork buns as an appetizer. It was pretty good but the price can't be beat. You get a fair portion in comparison to the price.

We ordered the street  noodle with fried shrimp and I enjoyed it. They have five levels of spicy and I opted for the 2 and felt it for sure. Keep that in mind when ordering as I'm sure the waiter will remind you. It's also a BYOB place and we were charged 50 cent each for a recycling fee. 

We did end up coming here Sunday for lunch before departing back for Philadelphia. I would go here again for sure as the price can't be beat."}
{"text":"Have you ever had a meal that just made your day better? Well I have at Noodlehead. I stopped in for lunch a few days ago and could not believe how delicious the food was. I had the green curry at the spice level of 3. It was the perfect level of sweet and spicy, the sauce was truly to die for! The noodles were done PERFECTLY! My grandmother got the pad Thai at the spice level of 0. I've eaten a lot of pad Thai but this was absolutely the BEST! I was so happy with our experience that I can't wait to return this week. I want to try the pork buns! I HIGHLY suggest going!"}
{"text":"Good inexpensive casual neighborhood joint. A bit salty like most Asian cuisine, but very tasty.  Be careful with the \"heat\" as it can be incendiary.  Frenetic atmosphere.  BYOB is a plus."}
{"text":"Limited menu (which is a good thing!) and the food is outstanding, but why no phone? I have to come in, order, and do what for 15 minutes in 6¬∞ weather because it's too crowded to wait inside? Again, the food is phenomenal, prices are super reasonable, but take out is a huge hassle if I can't order before I walk through the door."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is a great restaurant. The food is always on point and my friends and I love that it is BYOB and located right next to Millie's for the perfect dessert combination. Usually the service is on point too -- at one point I was going so often that the servers started to remember my name and order and that was great (special shout out to Bonnie). However, i have noticed some changes over the last month. When I've been there on very busy-moderately busy nights the hostesses look completely miserable and have been unfriendly/borderline rude to customers. I have worked in the food service industry for years and I totally understand and forgive mediocre service on a busy night because of the stress. But I've begun to notice a pattern, even when it isn't insanely busy, and that makes me sad because it makes me want to come here less often if staff are unhappy! Not only because it is less pleasant for me but because it makes me wonder how management is treating them. I'm rooting for noodlehead still!"}
{"text":"Street Noodle #2 and the steamed buns. I'd eat them every day if I could! This place has become a new favorite of mine. Bring your own favorite wine and make a night of it. I have been here several times and have yet to have anything but the most wonderful experiences."}
{"text":"I may be the only one in Shadyside who doesn't enjoy this place so you probably shouldn't listen to my review. But I can tell you Nicky's Thai Kitchen on the North Side is so much better!"}
{"text":"This place is the Platonic Form of comfort food.  Noodlehead is my neighborhood noodle joint and I want to eat it all the time.  The restaurant is a little too precious for its own good in some ways-- they don't take credit cards and they don't have a phone??--but the food is so yum that I forgive them.  It's BYOB and almost all the noodle dishes are $9, so it's a super inexpensive date night, if you can get a table.  I still really wish they'd offer me a telephone number so I could call ahead for takeout. 

So on to the food.  The pork steamed buns are a must-try appetizer.  I often threaten to go there and just get multiple orders of these for dinner, but it hasn't happened just yet.  My favorite noodles are the pad see yew--sweet, tangy, and good balance of ingredients.  The green curry linguini is great, though I wish it had some veggies. Note that everything is quite spicy, so a 3 out of 5 spice is more akin to a 7/8 out of 10 at a lot of other Thai places.   

There is nothing disappointing on the menu.  One of the best values around, for sure."}
{"text":"Noodlehead is an Americanized Thai restaurant that has great food, service, and ambience. I ordered the Street Noodle #1 with a side of pulled pork belly steamed buns.

The buns are so good that the entrees pale in comparison. It's dual sour and salty flavor really took me by surprised. Furthermore, the meat just melts in your mouth, bursting with flavor. The bun itself was fluffy and nicely done.

As for the Street Noodle #1, I really enjoyed the fried chicken, but the sour noodles just didn't sit well with me. It's the reason why I gave Noodlehead 4 stars instead of a much deserving 5.

I had a taste of my friend's Chiang curry, which was much better than the Street Noodle #1."}
{"text":"Stopped by here during our PA road trip on account of the great reviews. We came as a party of 6 during the middle of the day and there was no wait at all.

I ordered the Street Noodle #2 with no spice. I tried a friend's dish with spice level 1 and it was a drastic difference. I cannot imagine how spice level 5 would be. Tread carefully here. The dish came with a good portion of shrimp tempura and noodles. It was delicious.

The pork buns were very good as well. No as fatty as I'd like but there'a good chunk of meat in there.

My biggest gripe was the long wait time for the food to come out. Our food took a good 25-30 minutes. Meanwhile, we saw smaller parties at other tables (that came in much later than we did) get their food quickly. Another party of 3 got their food within 5-10 minutes of sitting. Even our server was apologetic -- no reason was given as to why it took so long for us. Did they forget our order?

Anyway, other than how long the food took to the come out, note that this place only takes cash.

Coming from NYC, the best part of this place is the prices. At $9 a dish, it feels like a steal."}
{"text":"I love the food here, very affordable and very delicious! My only complaint is that it can be impossible to get a table. I've had success at 3pm on a Sunday and 5pm on a Thursday. Otherwise, if you want to come during a normal meal time, expect to put your name down, head down the street for a drink, and come back for dinner 1 - 2 hours later. They will call you when your table is almost ready, so no need to stick around while you wait.

My favorites are probably the See Yew and the Chiang Mai Curry (both with tofu) at spice level 2, but everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"I've heard so many great things about this place and am so glad I finally got to try. We got the pad thai, kee mao, street noodle #1, and the pulled pork belly steamed buns.

Pad Thai was super delicious. Street noodle #1 was also very good, chicken was fried perfectly. The pulled pork belly steamed buns were good but for $7 you only get two, so I thought that was a little pricey. Cash only!!

They give you large portions for the noodles. I don't think most of their prices are too bad considering how much food you get. Plus it's super delicious in my opinion."}
{"text":"Yum!

Unlike most noodle shops, which are usually more Japanese or Vietnamese in focus, or Chinese, this one is of a predominantly Thai bent.

I stopped in here tonight for a light bite mainly because my mouth is sore from a medical procedure and I'm only eating soup and soft food for now, plus I do love a good noodle shop and have wanted to try this place.  

I got the Sukhotai noodle soup because it looked like I would have little chewing to do since the pork in it was ground.

It was absolutely delicious, and definitely manageable in the chewing department.  

And surprise of surprises, the heat scale they have actually means something!  I normally like a 12-15 on a 1-10 scale in Asian restaurants because most even make 10s super bland for the average American palate, but with a sore mouth, I only ordered a 1 out of 5, figuring that would give me a slight sense of their seasoning while still keeping me safe.  But wow, it had *waaay* more kick than 99% of other places!  Which ordinarily I would have loved - and it *was* absolutely divine - but I unfortunately had to send it back for a 0. Which was still only a fraction less delicious.  

The portion size was much smaller than at most noodle houses, but a much more reasonable serving for a single meal, and at only $6, it's a real steal.  Ideally, an appetizer would round this out into truly a good amount of food for dinner, but I just could not manage it today. The most expensive dishes top out at a whopping $15 - still a fantastic bargain.  

I will totally be back to try out the rest of the menu when my mouth heals up."}
{"text":"Maybe the best noodle joint in the city. It's BYOD and cash only (there is an ATM in the back). Their service is FAST but there is usually a wait during peak times. They use a 5 step spiciest scale and a 5 will be strong. Obviously, everyone is different, but I enjoy spicy food but typically order a 3 and have never wished I went higher."}
{"text":"The quality of the good has been slowly slipping. It's cash only AND byob. To me that means I will resort to take out. I have dreams about the bahn mi served here and so I will always return, under whelmed and slightly over stuffed. It's a wonderful addition to the take out rotation."}
{"text":"You're still The One, Noodlehead.

A year after our first visit we returned to Pittsburgh (for another concert! Why are acts skipping over Cleveland?) and Noodlehead was to be our first stop! I have been dreaming of the pork buns and their sweet/spicy marinade for the past 16 months and I was NOT disappointed!

On this trip, in addition to the mouth-watering pork buns, we ordered the Chiang Mai Curry and the Pad Kee Mao - both at a spice rating of '1' - and they were spot-on! I am getting hungry just thinking about them now.

This is my best pointer for a trip to Noodlehead: be sure to note that their spice scale is not the same as your average American Asian restaurant. Whereas I usually order medium-spicy at most Thai spots, at Noodlehead I can barely handle the 2/5 spice level and find 1/5 more comfortable. You've been warned! 

That being said, come to Noodlehead, bring your dry sauvignon blancs and light lagers and your cash, and enjoy some of the best Thai street food in the Rust Belt!"}
{"text":"Craving Thai in downtown Pittsburgh? Noodlehead is here for you! :D

Never would have thought that I'd be able to get legit delicious Asian baos (bread buns) or noodles at a cafe called Noodlehead, but whaddya know.

Being a hipster spot, the wait here to sit can take some time. Once you're seated, service is pretty fast. 

Pulled pork steam buns || $7
Tender pulled pork & crisp cucumber slices wrapped in two steamed buns. Rather pricey since each little bun turns out to be $3.50. But if you have the cash, these are definitely tasty snacks you'll savor. 

Pad Thai with Shrimp || $9.50
Nice portion of noodles, bean sprouts, and shrimp. The noodles are cooked perfectly al dente with a nice chew. Loved the sauce and dish overall. Would definitely recommend ordering this as an entree."}
{"text":"As with every great love affair, it's best to address weaknesses from the beginning.  That said, there's no phone to place reservations and take-out orders.  It's also cash only so, plan ahead.  Since discovering Noodlehead there hasn't been a week I'm in town and haven't had a love boat bowl.  It's INCREDIBLE! The best mix of hearty, flavor and warmth.  I like spicy hot and order level 3 spice--it sounds low, but still kicks you in the toosh.  Their Pad Thai is also great, as are their little pork buns which come two per order.  I find myself stalking up for the week picking up two or three love boat bowls.  It's actually embarrassing.  I imagine they'll start knowing me by name soon, and I'll keep returning (15 minute drive) as long as the food and prices stay the same. 

xo,

very happy customer/fan."}
{"text":"My bf and I went to this place as we saw a high yelp rating. So firstly it was a bit hard to park near this store but we managed to find a street parking in the nearby block. Secondly, the restaurant is cash only but has an ATM in it so it wasn't that inconvenient. Thirdly I think the noodles are really amazing, I ordered the street noodle number 2 with fried shrimps and thin noodle (the yellow egg noodle, like the materials in the wonton noodle - a Hong Kong traditional dish). My bf did the wide noodle with baby boo choi and basil and chose level 2 spicy - we were really surprised by how spicy it is for only level 2!! It was really spicy - I wonder if the chef put in too much hot chili pepper or it's actually this spicy - I would suggest eating #1 spicy if you do not have a high tolerance of spicy food. I did the mint ginger ale as well it tastes really cool (like a toothpaste flavor). Overall I think this place is really good and dynamic but you gotta watch the spicy level!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. My soon to be in-laws and SO came here to give it a try, since they are the cheaper alternative to other Thai places. We ordered one of every appetizer and were blown away by the flavors. After eating all of that we obviously had to get a main dish as well (don't judge, we get hungry). I ordered the See Yew and fell in love, so did everyone that ordered the Street Noodle (1&2). Along with the food, you can't beat the fact that there isn't a corkage fee, only a .50 recycling fee. 
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The awesome pros: 

CHEAP - entrees for 9 bucks and under.
BYOB - only 50 cents a person!  You can't find a cheaper BYOB anywhere in the city; trust me!
Trendy atmosphere and quick service.
Pad Thai was super-peanuty, which is just the way I like it.

The limited cons:

Cash only, no biggie, but just something to note.
Parking can be a slight PITA on South Highland.  I recommend parking on Alder and walking up.
Limited menu.  All the basics are there, though.

Overall, enjoyable experience and will be back.  As far as Thai food is concerned, I do think there are better places in the city.  If you are looking for an inexpensive date night, Noodlehead is a great option."}
{"text":"The food was entirely too spicy. My girlfriend got a 0/5 and still could not eat it because of the spice. Great service and great appetizers."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice, but a bit loud. The food was horrible! I don't know how it has such a good reputation. Our dinner appeared to be over cooked store bought linguine with breaded chicken thrown on top that tasted like rotten fish."}
{"text":"This was an easy 5 stars for what it is.  It is a cash only homemade noodle joint that serves delicious food at a very reasonable price.  It's 'nice' enough for dinner out with friends and the BYOB policy makes it a fun evening.  But it's inexpensive enough for a weeknight fix.
The food is definitely crave-able.  I've been a few times now and the food and service have been consistently great...although I have not tried a friday or saturday night when it's crazy busy.
I love the pork belly steamed buns and the See Yew.  My husband loves the Pad Thai and I have heard great things about the Chiang Mai Curry from friends.  The noodles, meat and veggies are fresh.  Importantly for me the meat and veggies are not overcooked as they can often be in noodle dishes.  The portions are large and definitely left me enough for lunch the next day (and kept well to the next day)."}
{"text":"Of the many (good) Thai restaurants tucked away around town, there's Thai...and then there's noteworthy, no-nonsense Noodlehead. It's a fairly limited menu, but that speaks to the great care 'n attention put into each dish. The kitchen's consistency is on point. Order freely because there's nary a bad thing to be had! My fave \"snack\" is the pork belly steamed buns and the Chiang Mai Curry is my go-to noodle. But be forewarned...while the \"1-10\" spice scale is for the others, Noodlehead's five level heat index is da real Holyfield. Lastly, service is pleasant, professional, and fast. And the stylish, minimalist decor while unexpected, simply works. No phone + no use of 'Nowait' means you just gotta be in the know. More importantly it's straight cash, homey. Now go and go often!"}
{"text":"Don't leave without trying the Chiang Mae Curry Noodle and the Pad See Ew. The pork belly buns are good but not economical. Cash only so be prepared."}
{"text":"Everthing here was delish. The resturant was cool and minimal. It's byob with cool glass bottle sodas. We brought a 6 pack of Stella which paired well with the spicy flavors we enjoyed. We chose a level 2 on the 1-5 chart for everthing, which was still pretty spicy.
We started with the belly buns, pig wings and Thai fried chicken. The belly buns were wonderful and flavorful. Soft buns with awesome pork balanced with clean crisp radish. The pork wings were great to spicy sweet tender the are worth going back. The Thai chicken was good but couldn't compete with the more flavorful 
dishes.

We had the loveboat soup, which was the most spicy dish of the night. The thin spicy broth and thin rice noodles with ample veggies is the type of soup that builds in heat as you eat but is too good to put down.

We moved on to the street noodle 1, chaing mai curry, and the yee saw. Street noodle 1, with its generous portion of Thai fried chicken was clean and spicy. The chaing mai was my favorite dish of the night. The tender chicken and twisting noodle were lovingly drenched in a warmingly hot, creamy delish yellow curry sauce. The yee saw was very good spicy sweet and I loved the big chewy noodles.

I would say this place with its great atmosphere, great food, and great service is a great date spot. The above meal ran 70.00 but the portions were large and easy to share. As far as beer I would suggest stay away from IPA'S and Stouts. Any clean belgain or American lager, euro pilsner or even a light corona would work well."}
{"text":"My favorite part of the restaurant is the aesthetics. They've brought together contemporary and rustic in a very cute way, and I just enjoyed being there. 

We ordered the well-known pork steam buns, and they were savory and flavorful. The pork is all sauced up, and they pair it with pickled vegetables and a gooey bun.

I ordered the see yew with a spice level of 2, knowing that I wanted something with a tiny kick, but that I can't stand too much spice. The noodles were fat and done to perfection, and this dish reminded me of pad Thai without the peanuts. If you aren't tolerant of too much spice like me, do not go beyond level 2!

I snuck a bite of the Chiang Mai curry from my husband, and had he ordered it with chicken, it might have been my favorite of the table. 

Service was very good, and we were very pleased with the experience."}
{"text":"I walked in to Noodlehead, looked at the sign, and was immediately turned off. Right off the bat this restaurant came off as snobbish. It is clearly posted that they do not allow substitutions or additions. They also refuse to sit you until your entire party is there. They also have the words \"no phones\" posted. Not sure what that means. Good thing their food was delicious. It was cool that you get to choose how spicy to make your dish. I could go back if I ever go to Pitt again."}
{"text":"A nice looking place/ cool neighborhood and visitors. Also great that theyve got outdoor seating that accomodates dogs. Service was average at best, the menu/ plates served as vegetable only options were extremely underwhelming, the sauce/ flavor was on par with upscale chinese take-out, noodles were tasty.  In general, id go back if i was forced to, but unlikely to do so on my own will."}
{"text":"I love this place?The pork belly steamed buns is fantastic!!! I highly recommended it"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday and we were seated immediately. The setup is really nice, as is the decor. It's BYOB, but unfortunately we were unprepared.

We ordered the Sweet & Spicy Pig Wings and the Chiang Mai Curry. I wasn't a huge fan of the wings, but the curry more than made up for it. The wings were just not nearly as good value as the curry which was much more substantial and only cost a little bit more.

I love all things coconut, so it was no surprise that I was obsessed with the yellow curry coconut milk sauce. My only issue with the Chiang Mai was that it was a little messy to eat. As hard as I tried, I simply could not avoid getting little splash marks all over my shirt (and my GF had the same problem). Anyway, the deliciousness was easily worth the extra laundry."}
{"text":"Delicious! Though I prefer a smaller, more quaint atmosphere, the food is really good :)"}
{"text":"I always get the chiang Mai noodles, pork buns and honey lemongrass tea-it's a great meal. Good prices, big portions, fast service. Other noodle dishes I am not so impressed with."}
{"text":"Even though mi amigo and I had just enjoyed a taco dinner, I urged him to try a pork bun here! Sure enough, anything you put in a heavenly white bun tastes amazing, and noodlehouses pork & pickled cukes were very satisfying! I also loved the lemongrass tea and overall vibe.  Next time I'm in PA I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place more than 20 times in the last one and half year. I wish I had started yelping long time ago! Interesting details of the restaurant, they don't use phone, they dont accept debit or credit cards, but there is an ATM inside the restaurant, they offer tables only if the entire party is present. Last but not the least, I was there for dinner most of the times I visited and I never got the table without waiting for atleast 5 minutes. 

Now coming to the food,  my favorites are street noodle 1 and 2. I am a spice level 3 person. I am a fried chicken fan any day. Street noodle 1 has thai fried chicken and it is so tender and delicious. Street noodle 2 has shrimp and it is good too. Menu says tempura shrimp and the last few times, I got normal shrimp, but it is still tasty, so I don't have any complaints about that. 

Price here is very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food they provide. If you have friends visiting Pittsburgh, you might want to take them here to taste the flavours of Thai street food inspired food."}
{"text":"It's a smaller menu which is great for indecisive people like me. It's got a small variety of appetizers, and we chose the grilled beef and pork belly buns. The grilled beef has quite a kick to it which I didn't expect at all. I guess I didn't look at the menu closely enough. It was good, but I believe there is a good amount of spicy green peppers in it. The pork belly buns were very yummy. 

I got the pad kee mao with shrimp (usual spicy level for it is medium because it's in a spicy basil sauce already, I just went with that). WOW it was spicy haha. It was so good though, I just kept drinking a lot of water. Next time I should get the pad see ew (sweet soy sauce based) with a spice level of 2-3 instead maybe. All in all, delicious food, and they're doing the Thai spicy right. 

The chill vibe inside was nice, and the service was very good. I enjoyed my food a lot, the only thing is that it's quite a large portion of noodles (tasted very fresh!) so I didn't finish it. I wish I had a bigger stomach to eat it all haha. I'll definitely be back when I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"A little strange that there's no phone and it's cash only, but the food is so good I don't care."}
