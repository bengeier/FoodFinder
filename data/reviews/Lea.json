{"text":"Great design for a long, narrow space - wood on the ceiling, glass floor.  Noisy, like most restaurants today but great music created a good vibe. Very attentive service from our waiter. The food - very, very delicious. Probably the best octopus I've every had.  My friend enjoyed her kale salad and tuna as a main. Everything tastes fresh and well seasoned. Original ingredients. Definitely will return many times to sample some of the other tempting dishes that passed us on the way to the diners."}
{"text":"New discovery in Westmount. Very cozy ambiance, food is excellent, had scallops, one of the best I had. Service was great. Glass floor was very nicely designed. Recommended to try."}
{"text":"Awful service at the bar-avoid!! They didn't even take our order after 30 minutes of sitting in plain view. I wanted to give this new restaurant a try, but after that lousy reception I am turned off. Don't waste your money if there are so many other good restaurants in Montreal to go enjoy."}
