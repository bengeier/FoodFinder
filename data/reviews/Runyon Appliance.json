{"text":"After the reviews I read online, I was a bit skeptical of the company the Home Warranty sent.  However, after their visit today, I felt compelled to write this review.  I will admit, the scheduling aspect was different:  speak to receptionist and get a day for the service.  After that, they call you in the afternoon with the time frame.  It is an automated call back voice, so I was a bit taken aback.  Then an automated call to tell you the tech is on the way.  They might want to consider telling the customer the same.    My time frame was  from 2-5 today (ONE day after scheduling).  John arrived a 2:11.  He assessed the fridge, went outside an got a new mother board, and had it in and running in under 20 minutes.  He was very polite and handled the fridge nicely.  I was relieved it was so easy.  Thanks for your service."}
{"text":"RUN.  If this is your service company, ask for someone different ASAP.  Very unprofessional in scheduling.  You are held hostage to there tech schedule.  They could care less of yours.  They set up the appointment and either get there way to early, which is great if you don't work , or don't show up at all, and say you are not in their system, even when the warranty company has a confirmation #."}
{"text":"I'm on my forth visit with this company and the dishwasher STILL keeps breaking. For the latest visit they took me off the schedule because I couldn't take the \"we're 10 minutes\" out call. I was at work in a meeting and had someone at my house waiting on them. If they were only 10 minutes out, why not just knock on the door? Someone was there. When I called frustrated that I had to reschedule, the manager Mandy kept putting it back on me saying it was my fault because I didn't answer the phone or confirm my appointment last week. Which I did but they didn't have a record of it. She was unsympathetic, rude and condescending. Their business must be doing really well because they have ZERO customer service skills and apparently don't need the business. I'm only using this company because my home warranty company has them as a preferred vendor. This drama with the dishwasher feels like it will never be over and I'm now considering just buying a new one so I don't have to deal with it anymore.   Unfortunate that the scheduling process is so horrible because the tech was very polite, on time and very professional."}
{"text":"We had terrible service from them on our clothes washer repair. When they came out to diagnose the issue it worked fine because they ran it when it was empty! The problem only occurred when you are washing clothes and I feel like they should have suggested that. So, I sent them a video of the problem. They diagnosed it and said they wouldn't be able to pick up the washer for another week. It took them a week to repair it and they had the Gaul to tell me that it was fixed, but they couldn't deliver it for another 4 days. They out right lied to me twice."}
{"text":"Lowe's sent Runyon's Appliance out to repair our refrigerator April 14th, 2015.  The problem was a main board so they ordered the part and informed us it would take 2 weeks.  It is now May 4th, 2015 and we still have no part.  I just spoke to Jerry at Runyon to find out where our part was and he says it is at least 3 days out and he could not give me a guaranteed date.  Keep in mind, I have been calling daily since April 23rd, 2015 for status of this part and every time I was promised the part was \"on the truck\" and would be delivered the next day.  I informed Jerry that we needed a definite date, and if he could not provide one, I would have to contact Lowe's about the delay.  He told me that I could go ahead and call Lowe's...if they called him, he would be telling them the same thing he told me anyway.  Very rude!!  Runyon Appliance does not care about customer service at all.  I just contacted Lowe's and informed them of the poor service provided by Runyon and a formal complaint has been filed against them.  Lowe's really took care of us and is sending us a check for the full original price of our refrigerator so we can go purchase a new one immediately.  Way to go Lowe's!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever with a service done my appliances! Never use these people  1 month to replace a burner on my stove. Thanksgiving was very difficult"}
{"text":"Runyon Appliance came out to service my dryer. They said a part that was ordered should take 3-5 days. It took 3 weeks for them to come out and repair. It was hard to get a real person live when I called. They came out to fix it on a Tuesday and the following Friday it was blowing cold air again. Upon contacting my warranty company, I requested specifically NOT to have Runyon come service my dryer again. A horrible experience."}
{"text":"My home warranty company placed a service request with this company to service my refrigerator yesterday.  Runyon never called me, I had to call them and then the girl said she couldn't get someone to work on it until next week. Then she called me back and said oh well we can't work on your refrigerator because we don't have a licensed LG technician and you need to call your warranty company back to have them send someone else. What great customer service! I definitely will not be recommending this company."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! the service man has NO clue how to be respectful of the people in the household, they never show up on time or when they say. He has NO clue how to repair a dishwasher. He has been out twice and they have had a part in yet I have to call to get them to come out yet again! Far from a professional service man. We called and complained yet they are still sending out the same horrible person! WORST Customer Service ever!"}
{"text":"The gentleman that came out to fix my washer was polite and efficient. Cleaned up after himself and cleaned the area after the repair.  The operator that handled the scheduling confirmed everything and was really nice. I would be happy if they came out to fix anything else."}
{"text":"Excellent installation job on very expensive dishwasher. No scratches and tech was very courteous. I did not experience any issues with the office as posted in other reviews. I would recommend Runyon to anyone. I was not charged extra for living almost out of the city. Very reasonably priced,quality service."}
{"text":"This company is very poor on administration and customer service.  They lose part orders, don't call back when they say they will, and generally don't get the job done in a timely fashion.  If you wish to wait weeks for your repair, then you should call them!  We had a recent repair through our home warranty company and I won't go with them again because of the delays and the errors in part orders.  Thumbs WAY down on this one."}
{"text":"Do not go with this company if you don't have to. They are nearly impossible to get ahold of and you will be put on hold immediately without even being able to say a word if they actually answer the phone. Had to hold for a long time and get hung up on just to call back and hold again and not get anywhere with scheduling them to come out. Someone is always \"going to get back to you\" and then they don't. Once you actually talk to someone it is hard to get them to commit to a timeframe for when they will come out to look at your appliance."}
{"text":"Our home warranty company sent us Runyon Appliance company. Oct 4th our refrigerator broke, the part we needed was to come in on the 16th.  Never a phone call to inform us that it in fact wasn't. We called them to find out the part wasn't being delivered until the 24th. Some things are out of our hands and we understand that. What we don't understand is an attitude from their Customer Service. The women they have to \"help\" their customers are well below acceptable.  No calls to inform customers of status, attitude because we are frustrated , now I have been in customer service for over 40 years. I would never treat a client the  way we have been treated. Apparently there is no management because they never transfer the call nor does a manager or supervisor call to help the situation."}
{"text":"A week ago, Runyon replaced a broken pump in my washer but was still not working properly. The service technician, Abijah, who came out to fix my washer yesterday was professional, pleasant and knew what he was doing. Abijah figured out the problem and got my washer running smoothly again. I will ask for him the next time my appliances break down. Very happy with the results."}
{"text":"Leaving review this for my grandmother. Service technician Allen came and worked on her washer the other day. She said he is very polite and professional. He even followed up with her the next day to ensure everything was working properly. She is very pleased with the service provided and the friendliness of this technician. She says Allen ought to get a raise! Thank you Runyon Appliance!"}
{"text":"Runyon Appliance was scheduled by Frigidaire to repair my refrigerator. Runyon called to cancel the service appointment, informing me that my scheduled repair date was not available.  As I tried to reschedule the appointment, I explained that I need a morning appointment, as I am not home in the afternoons. They said they won't do morning appointments in my area (Phoenix). Ever. Not one day ever. I explained that I'm simply not at home during the afternoons (I have to pick up those pesky kids from school). Apparently that made no difference to them. Now I'm back to Frigidaire to start the process over again. How rude of me to inconvenience Runyon by not being available to accommodate their busy schedule. How inconsiderate of my kids to expect that their parent would be available to take them home after school. Certainly I must qualify for the Selfish Customer Hall of Fame for having the audacity to request a morning appointment - any morning appointment. After all, Runyon really bends over backwards to take care of the customer by assigning those precise 4 hour blocks of time. Wow, the repair business must be a great gig, especially when you can tell the customers what's-what, rather than trying to accommodate them. In retrospect, it's pretty unreasonable on my part to think that the repair technician from Runyon should have to drive a whole 27 minutes (Google Maps) to get to my home. I promise I'll try to be a better customer in the future. Looking into selling my home and moving closer to Runyon. Probably home school those kids of mine so I can get my fridge working again. Hey, everybody's got to make sacrifices."}
{"text":"Our home warranty company sent Runyon's out to fix the oven in our kitchen. The initial visit to our home was Dec. 17. After a lot of bad noise our gas oven was repaired on Jan. 16.   It took some time to order the replacement parts for the oven, which we understand completely. And there was a mistake made when ordering the parts which contributed to the delay, which we can also understand. The thing that was most frustrating when dealing with this company was the lack of communication from the home office and tardiness of the service techs. My spouse and I lost track of how many times we had to call the office to figure out what was going on. The service techs (though usually nice) showed up outside of their time frames for every single appointment except for the final visit. We are appreciative and thankful that our appliance is working again but would not let Runyon's Appliance into our home in the future. We are also evaluating our home warranty company for sending them in the first place."}
{"text":"This business is extremely professional, courteous, and dependable. In the midst of a warranty nightmare, Electrolux finally found us a repair service that set up our appt, actually came for the appt!, figured out the problem, ordered the part and called to set up follow up appt. then Allen came back, within the time window they promised, fixed the washer and made our day. They are local and family owned. I will only use Runyon Appliance in the future! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Runyon Appliance was the company assigned to the work order I placed via my home warranty company, OneGaurd. When they initially called they stated the appointment must be on a weekday so my fiancé took half a day of PTO to be available between 12-4 (although the tech showed up after 4). He looked at the machine, said it needed a part they had to order and I made a follow up appointment for the following week. That next week, I was told they didn't have the part and it got pushed back another week. Finally, the tech comes out again (causing me to have to miss work) and this time they put in a part that's the wrong one. So again, this all gets pushed back. Last week I was supposed to have an appointment for Saturday but I received 2 emails saying WE had to unstack the washer/dryer before they would work on it. That was not only unprofessional, as it's their job to do what needs to be done to fix the appliance, it was also impossible as I cannot physically lift something that heavy, and even with help it would be a risk of us damaging the machine further. I contacted OneGaurd and spoke to Lisa, who helped contact them and make sure they know it's on them to prepare the appliance to be worked on. I get a call that same day from Runyon, stating we can't have the Saturday appt, and the only availability they had for this week was Friday. At this point I have no time off left so I am literally paying someone to be available between 12-4, which is their self-proclaimed afternoon hours. I just got a call today saying that appointment wasn't booked and they can't get me in this week. Mind you, this is going on over a month of us not having our washing machine. I asked to talk to a Supervisor and spoke with Mandy. I expressed my displeasure and frustration to her about the situation and she said they could do Friday morning, however I have my friend coming from 12-4, the time they told me last week. Mandy was very rude, stating \"If someone is already going to be at your house I don't get why we can't do it in the morning \" ... Really ? This is the level of customer service they offer?  After being placed on hold she comes back and says I can have the 12-4 appointment.  Although this issue is currently resolved and they will be out on Friday, I felt the need express to ANY who want to use them, the frustration Ive experienced, how unprofessional they are, and how poorly they run their business and treat their customers."}
{"text":"This is my first time using a home warranty, and can I say it is a horrible experience this far based on the company they sent me (Runyon Appilance).  They were efficient at first calling me the next after I filed a claim.  I had issues with my washer, dishwasher, and stove. They tech came out to my house and looked at my stove and 2 burners were not igniting and he looked at it and says what kind of person doesn't clean the covers where the flames come around. I was like ok how are you going to say something like that. Then he looked at the dishwasher and says it needs a new soap dispenser.  When he got to the washer he takes it apart and says how did a key get into the washer. Idk I bought the washer with the house maybe it was there before I bought the house.  I asked what the issue was and he says needs a new pump. Sounds good to me how long will it take he says 7-10 days.  he leaves and I notice a puddle of water all over my floor and the pump there just on the ground (he could have gave me the pump to put away) .  So 10 days go by and I hear nothing.  I then called and the girl that answered the phone was so unprofessional. She has no people skills and could use a better attitude, she looks up my account and she say it's 7-10 business days with an attitude. I asked the tech never collected payment when should I pay that. You can pay now if you want( thank god I didn't). Ill wait til the items are fixed she then h/u on me after I said that no bye, have a good day or nothing.  I didn't know ups or fedex or whatever shipping company doesn't work on weekends.  So they call me exactly 2 weeks from the day they first visited and says your appt is tomorrow at 8-11 am.  Unfortunately you can't give someone less than 24 hrs to tell them their appt is set.  (Should have asked what day works for both parties).  They called me back on Friday I asked if they work Saturdays and they said no, and I said I would call back with a time to reschedule.  Every time I call no answer just rings (no answering machine) ** maybe invest in one**.  After more than 6+ calls on different days of trying to reach them  and an email to them, I called my home warranty company AHS. They tried to call and no response either.  I just need my items fixed so I don't have to keep taking my clothes to a laundry mat.  If this doesn't get handled in a timely matter the bbb with my next step.    DONT USE THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"In the summer my washer Kenmore Elite He3T was making a banging noise on spin cycle. I took the dust cover off to check for leaks I left it off as a courtesy for Steve who was dispatched.   I was denied because it was \"just a noise\". If you google this unit based on the symptoms and how loose the drum hitting the backplane it was the bearing. I continued to use my washer with the noise and the plastic bezel shredded in my clothes resulting in water everywhere I removed the dust cover to remove the water from the machine using a shop vac to save my baseboards leaving the dust cover off. Steve came out and I ended up being denied again. I vented my frustration on Yelp. Runyon called and it was a misunderstanding on the dust cover removal. Runyon and the Home Warranty company replaced my washer. Glad for Runyon."}
{"text":"We are tenants and I am assuming that the home warranty requires the use of Runyon from the property management company. They haven't even made it out to do any work and we are not pleased with their service. Front line is the phone and the girl on the other end of the phone is rude and condescending. They must live in another world because I don't know how many working people can take off 1/2 day at the drop of the hate and wait around for them to be a NO Show. When I called the office to see how much longer it would be before they got here.... they said they left a message on my husbands phone that they couldn't make it out that day after all...... Not true!. Now they are calling at 2:50pm to say they will be out between 11-1 tomorrow! Not going to happen... already took a sick day for you to be a no show. I told them we could be there at 4:00 and that was the best we could do.... we don't do service that late in the day!!!! We will just live with the ice maker the way it is.... and let the Landlord know why!!!! don't use this company."}
{"text":"Save your time and money and go elsewhere! I contacted Runyon to service my refridgerator, the female I spoke with on the phone said they would not have a fridgidaire technician available for 4 weeks. Then later in our conversations she realized that I would be paying cash and stated she could get a technician out in two weeks, then told me she thought I was using a warranty thats why it would have taken 4 weeks.  I was told I would get a phone call they morning of my service which I did, and I was told at that time someone would be out between noon and 4 pm. The timeframe didn't work with my schedule so I rescheduled with the man who called me, the day we rescheduled NO ONE ever showed up, so I called the office, the female who answered said, technicians do not schedule appointments and I had to wait another week for someone to arrive and fix my refrigerator. I ordered a filter which when my guy finally showed up he did switched out the filter he also left water and a mess all on the outside and inside and did not offer to clean it up. Then never fixed my refrigerator!!! He said I needed a water valve so I said ok, he put in an order and NEVER called or came back to fix my refrigerator which is still broken. They did send me a bill though... We are now in Decemeber and this all happened in October."}
{"text":"We have always had a goood experience using Runyon Appliance. The front office staff are professional and work with you with respect to scheduling a time for the technician to arrive at your heme. The technicians are polite , professional and always get the issue addressed the first time around. The technician we had today was John who we have had in the past who once again exceeded our expectations. He gets the job done right the first time and we have a great deal of confidence in his abilities . Runyon is fortunate to hav an employ of his caliber."}
{"text":"Best experience with a home warranty company I have had. Showed up early and was very fast and courteous."}
{"text":"We got this company through our home warranty. When I called to set the appointment (yes I had to call them) the receptionist was rude and unaccomodating. They could not get someone out to even look at our dryer for almost a week. Ridiculous time frame. She could not even give me a time frame they were able to schedule. I asked that we be placed on a cancellation list, and she ignored me. I also informed that Tues morning I would be away at a meeting and would need a time of appointment to schedule appropriately. She refused and stated they would call the day before. I reminded her about the cancellation list and about the schedule restriction... These people called my grandmother in Memphis to confirm an appointment time!! My grandmother did not understand why they would call her and burden her with something going on in Chandler when they have me as an Az contact. She was also treated with little respect. She had called them back after they gave her a time frame of 9a-12p....or similar as she knew I would be unavailable untill around 11am as i would be in a meeting. When she reminded the receptionist of this fact the woman was rude to her and disrespectful. She basically told her oh well and they would come when they felt like it and they don't schedule actual appointments. Needless to say we contacted our home warranty dept and reported them for poor customer service. They got us with another company who scheduled a day out and actually gave us a time they would be here as well as working with our schedule. DON'T USE THIS COMPANY. good luck out there."}
{"text":"We had Runyon assigned to our house through our Home Warranty company and they were on time for their service appt. The serviceman - Allen was very professional and polite. He quickly found the problem with our dishwasher and stated that we needed a new motor. He ordered the motor before he left and stated that it would be ready to install in 3 days. We received a call in 2 days from them and we were told that they would be out the next day to replace the motor. Two new servicemen showed up - on time and again they were very professional and polite. They quickly installed the motor and our problem was solved - the dishwasher was running like a new machine.

Less than 24 hours prior to appointment I get a message and the window has been changed! I call the day of and the very rude woman tells me that I confirmed the appointment. Talented voice mail I have! I was then taken back when she told me the technician had three appointments prior to me and the longest part is travel time but he would be to my home within an hour and a half....is he doing any work???  I had my fridge fully accessible as indicated by home warranty company and he said he would not work on it because it was hooked to an RO. He told me it would say on the back not to do that. He must have forgot he said that after he adjusted the temperature outside the recommended range (thankfully my food didn't go bad) because he then pointed out where it specifically said an RO is acceptable!!! He told me to hire a plumber hook it to city water and call him back! Are you joking me??? Not a chance!! I promptly called the home warranty company and they sent a very reputable company who ordered the part and fixed my fridge in no time! I would save your money and time with this waste of a company! The technician just wants your home warranty copay!!"}
{"text":"My Home warrenty company sent Runyon to repair a refrigerator purchased new in 2003.  I would NOT recommend this company to service appliances.  scheduling an appointment took longer than acceptable. they have serviced the refrigerator 4 times and have fixed 3 things.  This tells me that either they are milking the Warranty Company or they are incompetent at their job.  A qualified service tech should do a through inspection before and after the work is performed to ensure the appliance is working or recommend replacing.  After the 2nd call, i requested the tenant get an invoice of what work had been completed.  My tenant says that the service tech was rude and directed her to the Warranty Co.     After 4 visits and still no resolution, i had to request the Home Warranty Co send another appliance co."}

{"text":"Runyon was the repair service used under my Lowe's clothes dryer warranty.  They showed up within the time window and performed the repair.   They had to obtain approval and get a part, but were back out within a few days.  After reading all the negative reviews, I was worried, but experienced no problems with the company.  They use a robo call type service to confirm appointment time the day before where you press 1 to accept the time, etc.  Also, repairman called when he was a few minutes away."}
{"text":"Runyon has a contract with Fidelity home warranty. My tenant scheduled a weekday appointment, not at his convenience, that ended in a no call no show. My tenant said he would do \"without\" the working appliance to not have to take off work on a weekday again. I personally called Fidelity, to file a complaint. Tenant scheduled a Saturday appointment, I cancelled that appointment so he would not have to deal with such a company. In this city, you should have your appointments better coordinated and at the very least communicate if you are running HOURS behind of schedule.  ETA: I suppose I must back up my claim as per company request to deem my review fair, not because I had a bad experience with the company which is the reason for YELP in the first place. However I shall humor you:  Our call to Fidelity was placed 13 June. Service fee was paid ahead of time per PM company CC.  Appointment scheduled for 22 June between the hours of 1-5 which resulted in a no call no show.   Work order # 6519564  Tenant called Runyon, several times with no response. I suggested my PM call Runyon to understand what the issue was. Runyon argued saying Fidelity never called them to let them know to schedule an appointment. Though appointments are scheduled between Runyon and Tenant... am I missing something here? Tenant called and an appointment was made.   In our confirmation email, it states:  \"     Fidelity National Home Warranty (FNHW) has assigned Runyon    Appliance LLC to address your Appliance at (Removed property    address)You should hear from them within two business days to    schedule a mutually convenient appointment. If you do not hear from    Runyon Appliance LLC within two business days, or if you need to    change or cancel your appointment time, please call them directly at (602) 258-1520 \"  Of course it is completely feasible my tenant pulled an appointment out of thin air, with Fidelity creating a false work order....   I am happy to provide you with the emailed receipt of services requested through Fidelity... If I need to prove my review as being fair any further. Please provide me with an email address."}

When i called the comapny back and spent 12 minutes on the phone with the company asking that they please send the technician they said that now it was 15 minutes and \"outside the time window.\" I asked to speak with a manager and they said they would relay my message.

Both the staff that work the phones and George are friendly and professional.  My washing machine and stove were fixed without much hassle and are still functioning properly.  My only wish with this place (and just about all the other companies like them) is that they would be more accurate with their 4 hour windows.  Anyway, I am happy with the service I received and would definitely use them again."}

The tech was professional, detected the problem, efficiently resolved the issue and sought approval from my warranty company.

I am happy to say that my service person, Nick Runyon, was extremely polite, professional, and fast. He was extremely honest and didn't try to say something else was broken and \"milk it\" for more money. He told me what was wrong and fixed it (like an appliance doctor). So I have found my new appliance repair company. Program the number in your phone. It is like 911 for your appliances. Be prepared. Good service people are hard to find. (It sounds like a Weird Al song title.)"}
{"text":"I hesitate to give them 1 star. The office does not answer the phone when trying to confirm appointments. I had told them earlier the time frame of 10 to 2 was acceptable. So I didn't worry about calling them again for the 4th time since no one answered.  Then they said a technician called at 226pm and left no message. It was an out of state call so I thought it not relevant to anything. My tenants called to let me know that at 256pm no one had come. I called Runyon and it rang about 8 to 10 times. Finally someone answered and said the technician called and no one was home. She said that they weren't able to send anyone today. I asked for a supervisor. I was handed over to Nancy who told me that the technician had called at noon and said he would be there at 1245pm. She said he showed up and no one was there.  I told her that wasn't the case. Nancy then said she misspoke. There was still no one to go. Nancy them told me she was the highest of all supervisors and a part owner of the company.  I was already frustrated with Runyon due to another call on another building I own. I must admit I was pretty condescending as Nancy suggested I was. But she hung up on me before I could really get rolling. So I called the Home warranty company who assigned me to another person my request and the owner of Runyon's request as well.  I don't know if it is just home warranty company calls they don't like or just the general public at large."}
{"text":"In home tech was fine, but the lack of any sense of customer service is appalling. Was given window of 10-1pm for initial visit.  Tech arrived at 3pm.  Very nice guy, set me up to come back with needed part on Monday 9-11am.   Got call from the Schedule Master today who insisted the \"tech can't do that\" and at this point they could only commit to Monday and would call me on Friday to narrow it down to a 4 HR window.  She was arrogant, condescending and nasty.  Showed up on Monday but it was the wrong part.  Need to reorder and go through one more round of schedule hell.  Tech calls with 9-12 window.  Scheduler calls me a few hours later and gives me 10-1 window.   A couple hours later get email saying window is 11-2.  Tech shows up at 1:45, problem finally resolved.    Bottom line look at the reviews and how many mention Home Warranty Companies.  Good businesses don't have to resort to home warranty cos to feed them work.  Technicians were polite, efficient and professional, but seem to be held back by office lack of customer service and scheduling inc"}
{"text":"From scheduling to inspection they provide great customer service. They arrive within the range of time and also call 15 minutes before their arrival. Great customer service and personable employees!"}
{"text":"Had to use them with my home warranty.   After 3 times attempting to get them to my house of canceled.   I would rather pay them use them.  Worst experience using a company in my life.   The lady in the phone really didn't care.  I am guessing because they have a big contract with home depot.  Hope depot if you read this,  drop them.   There are hundreds of better choices."}
{"text":"Terrible experience with this firm. My manufacturer (Electrolux) twice contracted this company to repair my dishwasher. I stayed home on two different scheduled dates. They never showed up. Their excuse both times was \"We are having fax/computer problems, not receiving our orders like we should\". Well than, maybe it's time they invest in some updated equipment! I wasted 2 days from work and now I have to wait another 8 days before my appliance can be fixed. I will never allow this firm to ever work for me!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with my experience with Runyon Appliances through One Guard Home Warranty. I scheduled to have a service order on Saturday for a leaky washing machine. Finally got an appointment on Thursday (today). I have been home in anticipation of this fixture all morning, have not been out the door since yesterday. I discover this morning, after I check my cell phone, that a service person has come and gone. Charging me for a missed work order. Being home all day, all morning waiting in anticipation for the repair person to come, how is it that I have no service and no repair???. Runyon tells me they called my phone which is a fax machine number 4 times. A simple ringing of the door and a heavier knock works very well for actually going through to someone . My assessment is there was no audible knock nor ringing of my door bell. The service person knowing they would get paid anyone, as I had paid for the repair in advance just left with out any additional effort to actually have the door opened. Sure I missed the phone calls, that isn't the most uncommon thing, but surely if you ring my door bell it is heard. I rate this company poorly because there was no effort to resolve. Just the excuse they the tech tried to contact me. If so, if really truly he did- then my washing machine would be repaired by now. Maybe this is the hustle these companies use to take advantage of ppl who use home warranties as such. Paid regardless. Unfair practice. Shame on this company! Been home all day awaiting repair because of an inaccurate number. JUST RING A DOOR BELL AND KNOCK TO BE HEARD, NOT To just say you showed up....been home waiting. Why no service??? Poorly practice and willingness to service attitude."}
{"text":"I would give them ZERO stars if I could. Awful experience! Went through them for broken microwave (home warranty): took one week to get a person out, then another 2 to get the part, then the guy supposedly came and we were not at home (even though we are at home all day). Took another 10 days to get him back out. He fixed the microwave and now, one month later, it is broken AGAIN! Called home warranty and they assigned them on the job again. The scheduler said it would be a week for the guy to come out-NO WAY! It was several weeks last time for a shoddy fix!!!! I requested another contractor and now I'm $60 out plus a second claim on my warranty. Nevermind all the headaches of not having a functioning appliance for weeks and dealing with them on the phone. They never call you, you have to be calling them if you even want to have them do anything at all. How they are still running a successful business that way is truly beyond me. Seeing that others had the same experience, I am just speechless."}
{"text":"What a joke of a company.  The only reason I have used this company is because I was forced to by my home warranty company.  This is my second bad experience with Runyon.  First time I had them out for a broken washing machine.  I was schedule for an appointment from Noon to 3pm which is very difficult for me as it is in the middle of the day and I have to take the full day off work.  I needed my washing machine fixed so I had no choice but to take the noon to 3pm appointment.  At 2pm I called and was told that we were still on for before 3pm and that she called the guy that was coming out and he confirmed the appointment.  At 4:45 I called again and was told he would be there by 5pm and he called me at 6pm and said he was on his way.  He showed up at 7:15pm!  What a total disregard of my time and flat out lies when I was asking for updates.    I am now on my second appointment with Runyon because my dishwasher is broken.  Again, I was called yesterday morning saying that they would be at my house between noon and 3pm.  I could not risk sitting at home again all day long so I told them that would not work and I wanted a before noon or and afternoon appointment so that I would not have to take a full day off at work.  I was told that I would be called on Wed morning with an appointment time for the same day.  I am sitting at home, not going to work waiting on hold for over 5 mins for an appointment time because the repairman never called to schedule and I have no idea what is going on.   Just got off the phone with them at 9:35 and was told my appointment is between 9am and noon.  How was I to know this without them calling me?  I asked the guy on the phone how I was going to know about the appointment if no one called me and he said \"I don't know, I am just the guy who answers the phone\"   All this is just for the first appointment for them to order parts and then I have to go through this all again.  This company his short staffed and they over book the repairmen so that they have impossible schedules.  The do not have the staff to answer the phone and put you on hold as soon as you call without even talking to you.   I am going to let my home repair company about the problems and see if they can recommend another repair company that is a little more customer service friendly."}
{"text":"I don't usually do reviews but I felt compelled to do so after reading all the negative feedback. Anyway, I stumbled upon these reviews because I was googling Runyon to see if they fix air conditioners. I am about to contact American Home Shield and I would like to request Runyon if they do in fact, repair ac units. American Homeshield has sent Runyon Appliance out twice for two different repairs. The technician was the same young man, Abijah (not sure if spelled correctly) both times and he is excellent. He is honest and does great work. It's obvious he puts pride into his work. If I am able to, I will ask for him the next time they come.  The other comments on here are not good but this young man has made a stellar impression on us so we did not experience any of  the negatives. These were the two best repair experiences we've ever had, I wish all were like this."}
{"text":"I'm please One Guard decided to send out a dependable company. Sometimes home warranties can be such a nightmare but the whole staff at Runyons has given us faith in our warranty contract. The tech who came out was such a nice guy and I could tell he knew what he was talking about, in one service visit he fixed our microwave which is ironic since this is the second company out and our 5th service call in general. I'm very happy we ended up on a good note with Runyons."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. These guys are a total joke. My very first call to them let me know I was dealing with trash. After scheduling an appointment the receptionist hung up on me. I called back, and she acted as if it was perfectly normal... Just the way she ends calls. They sent someone to diagnose. That was fine... Yet likely incompetent. It took 3 weeks for them to finally get around to coming and installing two parts they ordered. Before I got to that point, I never once received a call from them to notify me of the status of my repair. I called them twice. I was hung up on again... normal. So with mounting pressure from the insurance company, they 'find my parts'. They were out the next day. This is when the guy works on the fridge and claims it 'fixed'. My wife opens the door and now the light is out. He bumbles through that repair and leaves. Within hours, the water dispenser and ice machine aren't working. Low and behold, the original problem wasn't fixed either. I called them, and they say they 'did all they can and I'll need to hire someone with more advanced equipment'. So after 3.5 weeks with a broken fridge and sucking a couple hundred bucks out of the insurance company - they claim incompetency on their part.   Don't hire them. Just simply don't."}
{"text":"Dye to excellence in choice of technician I received excellent repair service. After initial calls between frigidaire and Runyon appliances, Allen came out, diagnosed problem and replaced the ice maker within a couple days. Couldn't have asked for a more knowledgeable and pleasant technician. Thank you Runyon  appliances."}
{"text":"Runyons appliance took amazing care of me and my little family. My washing machine broke and I was extremely frustrated. My landlord didn't want to help much. I called Runyon and someone was out within the week and my washer was up and running before my landlord even replied to my email and phone calls.The cost was reasonable and the tech, Abijah, was kind and told me exactly what was going on and what he needed to do to fix it. I would highly recommend them to a friend."}
{"text":"I used this company through my home warranty. The service representative was very professional and very helpful. The only problem I had was that it was not communicated to me that parts needed to be ordered and then when the work was done I had to call to get a receipt of work that was done. But when I did called they were very quick about getting me a receipt via email which was probably the best way so now I have a record."}
{"text":"I called Runyon for my oven. They scheduled my appt 2 days later, on a Sunday. John M is the tech that came to my home. He was professional and curteous, the evaluation was made on my oven and repaired. I can't say enough nice things about my experience. I will recommend these folks to my friends and family."}
{"text":"Great Customer Service! Professional and willing to answer any questions we asked! Recommend to all my yelper friends!"}
{"text":"I'm glad to see that Jerry responded to my review. Therefore, I have added a star because the owner cares enough to read reviews.  You will see that I was truthful in my review. I didn't say they hadn't come out, just that we didn't know that they had because they never called. We thought they had no showed because my husband didn't receive the requested call during the stated appointment time on Wed the 19th. Even after numerous requests to be called we never heard from them. Please note: the invoice said there was no problem with the stove. However, my husband could see there was a problem and the other appliance repair company saw it and fixed it. I'll take Jerry's word that they won't turn us over to collections even though that is what Mandy told my husband over the phone. I was listening and heard her say it. She was the rudest service person we have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Awful experience.  Was referred through my homeowner warranty for a broken leaking washing machine.  The info was left for them Sunday.  They never called to make the appointment so I called them.  Made an appt for Friday (first available appt).  Got an email Day prior saying they'd come between 2-5.  Got a phone call confirming I'd be available and I said yes.  Friday comes and no one shows by 5.  I call and the worker tells me he had 10 spots scheduled that day and he was behind but he'd be there by 530.  530 comes and goes... at 620 I call him and he says he is '5 minutes out\".  I told him not to bother coming as I couldn't wait at home any longer.  He never phoned to say he'd be late either time... did apologize however.  I asked if they could come Saturday but he said no... they were already booked up.  I told him I did not want to complete the job with his company as they were obviously unreliable and I called my home warranty to change companies.  Very disappointed.  Took a week to get an appt that never happened."}
{"text":"IF YOU COME HERE TO SEE RUNYON'S REVIEW, I SUGGEST THAT YOU STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY AND REQUEST A DIFFERENT COMPANY IF YOU HAVE BEEN REFERRED BY YOUR HOME WARRANTY OR ANY APPLIANCE'S MANUFACTURE FOR SERVICE. THIS COMPANY IS UNPROFESSIONAL, RUDE, AND LIES.  I had a feeling it was not gonna be good when i read all the negative reviews, and indeed, i couldn't agree more and see why they give the company a bad review, and i got to say.  RUNYON APPLIANCE DESERVES A BAD REVIEW for the way they do business. Forgot to mention you might want to see all the complaints they have on BBB too, that tells you what kind of business they run.  So here's what happened,   The fridge broke down on 6/19, and contacted Frigidaire the next day 6/20(Tues), Frigidaire told me they set up an appointment with Runyon for Thursday appointment between 8am-5pm on Thursday. And Frigidaire said Runyon will call on wednesday to confirm the time for thursday after they receive the work order.  So i called them on Wed morning and asked if any possible way to go out the same day because hard to not have fridge with 118 deg weather for the week. I was told no because it was full and they still have not receive the work order. It wasn't after multiple calls later and few hung up in the middle of the call later did they confirmed the receiving of the work order. And so later on in the day around 4pm, someone from Runyon finally called to confirm to go on Thursday between 8am-5pm  Yep, you guessed it, i had to take a day off from work and waited the whole day at home and no one show up or called.  So I called them on Friday 6/23 and asked them why no one showed up yesterday at all and did not get a call even after the company called and confirmed on wednesday. Someone named Jerry answered the call and told me that their system only showed the morning conversation on wednesday and no one called to confirm thursday's appointment, that's why no one went and it is not their fault. So i told him that's not true and a lie since the someone did called from the office wednesday afternoon. So Jerry said he will ask the girl that does appointment when she comes in.  After I talked to Runyon I called Frigidaire customer service and told them about my appointment and it was a no show and asked if someone else can go out, she told me no being that they are the only company in the area. I told them about they supposed to go and ended up a no show and accused me for not calling them to schedule. Frigidaire said they will forward my request for a new provider so they can go out soon.  I called Runyon back about an hour later and talked to Shelby, and i couldn't believe the lie she told me. She said the reason the tech didn't go out was because Frigidaire pulled their work order back on wednesday afternoon so they are not responsible to go out. I said that's not true since Frigidaire didn't say anything about it and I just got off the phone with them. She said there's nothing they can do and hung up the phone.  So i called Frigidaire back immediately and told them about the situation and the lies, the person told me Frigidaire didn't call Runyon on wednesday afternoon or withdraw any work order from them(this proves Runyon lied). Then the person told me someone from Runyon called them 10 minutes ago and said they rejected the work order to service us because we were being rude to them. So now Runyon messed up on the appointment and blames Fridaire for pulling the work order out and accused me for being rude to them??? You can be the judge.... Everyone works in Runyon such a BS!! They don't schedule the service right and lied for not call to schedule an appointment and didn't even apologize once for the mistake but blame others. What kind of business is this?? No wonder all the negative reviews!  It seems like to me most people who gave negative review for Runyon are for services are being referred by home warranty or manufacturer, it really seems like they don't really care about the contract work at work, if that's the case, why does Runyon still in contract with them. With all the negative reviews posted by different users, Runyon always respond with the most BS excuses to defend themselves. It will be interesting to see what kind of BS Runyon will responds, whatever it will be, i will not buying any of it because it will more of their BS excuse.  Business like Runyon shouldn't even be in business the way they handle the customers. They are unprofessional, rude, bad attitude, incompetent and lies. Never dealt with a company like Runyon. Looks like I'm going to BBB next to complaint about them, will be their 9 out of their 11 negative reviews on there.  so my final advice.....ONLY USE RUNYON FOR YOUR SERVICE CALL IF YOU WANT HORRIBLE UNPROFESSIONAL UNFRIENDLY SERVICE."}
{"text":"first time using Runyon and I can say it was a good experience.  The tech was here when he said he would be and installed the glass in the oven door.  Now I have a working oven ! Thanks Runyon"}
{"text":"DO NOT use - they lie.  They said they were going to fix my fridge and said it would take a few days for the parts, then I called after 3 days and they said it would take 30 days for the parts so I called the home warranty company saying 30 days was too long.  After I made that call they changed their mind - and then said the fridge had an existing issue even though they were planning on fixing it earlier they decided to lie to the home warranty company once I said 30 days was too long to wait for a part."}
{"text":"Wow ! In reading the other reviews , I guess , I also was lucky to get John M. Our Warranty Company , OneGuard , assigned the repair of our leaking refrigerator , to Runyon Appliance . I was called and given a time frame , that John M , would arrive. He was well within the time frame , very courteous and professional. Explained what the problem was , what part was needed , and how long it would take . I was called within the time frame , and John , came , within the scheduled window , and installed the part . In dealing with needed repairs or service , I have found , when I need a service performed , I request the same company and service technician. It has proven , that using the same technician , is very beneficial !"}
{"text":"We needed repair of a dishwasher under warranty from Lowe's.  They sent Runyon to do the job and I'm completely happy with the result.  The technician, Matt, diagnosed the minor problem right away and gave me recommendations as to how to avoid it in the future.  I'll call Runyon myself next time I need an appliance repaired."}
{"text":"I have called Runyon on two occasions. One was for warranty work for a refrigerator, the second was not. Same issue and each time my technician was thorough and honest concerning my issues. I would recommend Runyons for their prompt and professional services."}
{"text":"I was assigned to this company. Tech showed up early then I was told It couldn't come back, though he showed up early! Customer service was horrible! Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"I call Runyon's directly, and I don't endure the agony of a home warranty company in the middle. I think the warranty companies are responsible for a lot of the problems with their service suppliers. Anyway, we don't have trouble getting an appointment in a reasonable time when we need one. We have had friendly service, and \"right the first time\" experiences with our appliances. We've used the company for repairs in our four family homes in the area and also for our four rentals. Our experience has been one that we can describe as honest, competent and fairly priced. We have had much more challenging experiences with other repair companies. As far as we are concerned, these are the \"good guys\". Runyon's also sells used appliances, and once in a while that offers an option that is more attractive than an expensive repair!"}
{"text":"My warranty company referred me to Runyon Appliance to have a dishwasher installed.  My first contact was last Thursday (October 23).  They were having the dishwasher picked up that afternoon and would call me that afternoon or on Friday (October 24) to schedule a time for installation.  No call.  I called the warranty company on Monday (October 27) and they told me they talked with Runyon Appliance and they would contact me by 5:00 pm to schedule the installation.  No call on Monday, October 27.  The big run around."}
{"text":"I'm happy to report that Allen from Runyon was quick, knowledgeable and friendly and fixed the problem with our freezer!! Our home warranty company referred us to them and we were extremely happy with our service call and repair."}
