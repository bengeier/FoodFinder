{"text":"Rodneys has been a hit or miss establishment for as long as I can remember.  If you go for lunch during the work week the service might be extremely slow (chewing ice cubes waiting for another drink slow) or your food might be prompt and servers friendly.  Same with the dinner rush.

We have yet to figure out the combination of getting a decent meal and friendly service inside so we stick to getting take out anymore.  Inside of the take out area they have a little six pack area, bakery, and small salads one can grab.  Those employees aren't typically standing there so you might have to wait a few minutes before they notice you.  But the food always tastes great and looks great which tells me its the servers that screw it up from kitchen to table.

As far as nightlife goes this place has none anymore.  They used to turn it into a dance club but that proved to be too dangerous as there were many fights and stabbings.  Now they close at 10/11 not even leaving their bar open so if you live near Rodneys and want to get one last drink before calling it a night do not swing by Rodneys.  

All in all I only recommend this place in a pinch.  Lack of consistency makes it difficult to say with enthusiasm that this is a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Good pasta, kind of noisy so if you want to go for a quick evening forget it.  If you want to order food to go they have mastered the process."}
{"text":"Ordered cupcakes for my bridal shower this past weekend and got there to pick them up and not only were there no cupcakes but the people at the counter had the nerve to argue with my bridesmaid about the time. Not only did we make the arrangements in person at the restaurant but my sister confirmed everything the week of. I understand mistakes happen but we don't need or deserve attitude from the staff on top of it. What if this had been my wedding cake? I wouldn't trust a special event to the rodneys bakery after this."}
{"text":"Having heard from friends that Rodneys was good, we decided to check it out.  We were seated very quickly on a Sunday afternoon.  There were about 20 others eating in the restaurant at the time.  It took our waitress 15 minutes to take our drink order.  Only a few more minutes after that to take our order.  Our appitizer was brought out fairly quickly.  It was delicious.  Our entrees came out about 20 minutes later.  That's the last we saw of our waitress.  She never came back to check on us, didnt come back to refill drinks.  We had to ask another waitress for boxes & our check.  The food was really good, but the service was some of the worst we've ever had."}
{"text":"We had a directors meeting here on a Thursday night. Bar area was not crowded and we had great service and reasonably priced cocktails. Food was great. Wait staff was very accommodating.

{"text":"Usually very good food.  It's bar food...upgraded.  I've dined here several times.  As much as I generally enjoy the food I would never go within two hours of closing.  The food isn't as fresh or good as it is during  peak hours."}
{"text":"I have had dinner here as well as enjoyed the nightlife here.   Food has always been good and service is good.   Entertainment has always been good when I was there as well.  parking is always the issue if you don't get there early, but I guess this says it is a popular place."}
{"text":"I really love Rodney's. I've been going there since I was a kid, and the food is really fantastic. It's a little expensive for Irwin, but it's great or a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"Great Place, wrong address 
It's 557 Wendel Rd, Irwin, PA 15642.
Salmon Salad is really good!"}
{"text":"They have great pizza here. I like the drinks too. They have a good selection. We took friends here for a birthday celebration and had a great adult night."}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  Prices are maybe a little high, but not terrible.  I usually just get the seafood alfredo, because they use big scallops, unlike the chain restaurants, like olive garden, plus their alfredo sauce is really good.  My whole family likes it there.  We have never had a bad experience, and most of their food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat one of the best in North Huntington prices are reasonable very very very good food.  Make sure to try the French onion soup. Also the veal Rumano is very good"}
{"text":"Absolute HORRIBLE service!! I mean total BOO. We are new to the area and have been trying new places every weekend. Needless to say we will NOT return to Rodneys. They took so many reservations that they couldnt accomodate walk-ins. To make it worse, the hostess was very rude about this. In addition, we felt so out of place. The owner greeted everyone that came in and totally ignored us. We were very upset and had to leave. Its sad that they let money walk out the door like that. Like I said, we are new to the area and are trying to scope out all those \"great\" places. Rodney's is not this place. Sorry Rodney."}
{"text":"Food came out at a reasonable time and good portions. The salads are nice especially the shark steak and the coconut shrimp. Servers were great about refills. Good price also."}
{"text":"This is not the 1st time we have been here & it won't be the last! This place is very good. Even though we were at a catered meal today, it was really good.

The chicken parm was very tasty, as well as the green beans and halupki!! There is also a nice deck which I might utilize during a future visit & have a few libations out there n'at!!"}
{"text":"The new bar is beautiful, the entrance is also remodeled and the dining room looks more intimate.  The problem is, the bartender keeps leaving the bar and is gone for long periods.  New bar, same poor service."}
{"text":"A decent restaurant that is one of the nicer places in Irwin.  There is a large bar, an outside deck, multiple dining rooms, and now a bakery which I have not tried yet.

The food here is good but nothing novel.  They have your standard Italian/American choices.  If you are going to be in the area anyway, give it a try as it is one of the better places to eat around there but I would not make a special trip just to go eat there."}
{"text":"The party pizza is perfect for any occasion! Delish!!!!! 5 stars.. Also the dining room is great for any banquet or luncheon... Great food, nice place!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch, on a Friday, with a group of friends.  The prices were very good, as was the food.  It looks like they have a very awesome outdoor tiki bar with fake palm trees and heaters (for when it gets colder in the fall).  I was there for lunch, but I think that I'd come back with some friends and check it out for drinks. They were advertising $2 draft beer for the outdoor tiki bar.  Of course, the tiki bar was closed at 11 AM on a Friday.  They also have a nice private room for having a party, such as a bridal shower or rehearsal dinner."}
{"text":"This was my first time back in years. I always remembered the food being good. It was an hour before close and it seemed that the two servers there ,with one table in the place had a hard time seeing that we were created promptly . I had the mussel appetizer as my dinner and my fianc√© had the lasagna. My mussels where very good but the lasagna was not so much. Said it came with meat sauce, barely any meat in the sauce. I ordered a dirty martini and didn't specify what level of liqueur I wanted( assuming that well would be something decent) it was bankers club. Over all not what I remembered and disappointed with our visit."}
{"text":"I'm appalled this place has more than two stars!  The prices aren't bad, but the food is mediocre (and that's being nice).  However, if you're used to going to fast food for dinner, then yes this place does have higher prices.  As far as the nightlife goes... if your idea of a great night is seeing people that look like and act like they belong on the \"Jersey Shore,\" then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Anyone familiar with Rodney's knows that it is a different place, depending on the day and the time that you are there. It is family friendly during the week and more of a bar atmosphere in the evenings and especially on the weekends. This is probably most likely due to the different areas: the bar, the outside seating, and the two dining rooms. I have been to Rodney's for drinks with friends, to host a bridal shower, out for my birthday to drink and dance, and for quiet evenings out with my husband. 

My most recent experience was for my aunt's 75th birthday and there were 10 of us. Although it was late in the afternoon on a Sunday and the place was very crowded, our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. I had a salad and split a pizza, and both were delicious. The waitress was very nice and efficient. She was even able to handle my uncle, who is extremely sick and tends to be nasty with people. She was able to take it in stride, and I was appreciate just for that. 

I highly recommend Rodney's. The only things that bothers me are that sometimes parking is an issue, which I saw others comment about. The other thing is that, on the weekends, whether you go for the bar atmosphere or a late dinner, there is still usual a cover charge."}
{"text":"A lovely little place with good Italian food and excellent desserts.

We ordered across the menu -- appetizers, salads, pastas, meats, and desserts.  All were solid offerings that made us happy.  And full.  Don't forget full.

The one downside here is that they have kind of a limited wine selection.  Some more cheap Italian offerings (get some Rossos!) would go a long way to pairing with the food."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with colleagues and I was pleasantly surprised!  The staff,was great, the food, delicious with very generous portions.  Make sure you order dessert!"}
