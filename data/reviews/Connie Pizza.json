{"text":"5 étoiles simplement parce qu'il s'agit de la meilleure pizza à Montréal. La Super-Spéciale est simplement hallucinante; une pizza toute garnie mais avec sauce à la viande, bacon et oignons. Un vrai délice! La garniture y est plus que généreuse.
Coté restaurant cependant rien qui ressemble à un vague comfort. Ambiance industrielle avec 3-4 tables pour la clientèle et chaises de bois. A utiliser principalement pour la livraison, le ramassage sur place ou pour une bouchée rapide au retour du travail."}
{"text":"Connie's is the local pizza place in my neighborhood. They have been in business for 50 years so they must be doing something right. 

They make a deepish dish style pizza that produces a juice slice on a think chewy crust. In addition to pizza, their menu includes many of the standards such as subs, slouvlaki and lasagna. This is mostly a delivery or takeout spot. They do have a small amount of seating, but there is not much in the way of ambiance. 

You can count on Connie's for home filling tasty food. Note that this is not one of those 2 for 1 pizza places with really cheap skimpy pizza. The ingredients here are generous and the pizza is filling, however the prices do reflect this as well."}
{"text":"Quality is not consistent at this joint. Sometimes it's the best pizza and sometimes it's a pile of crap. I wish their prices were less when they sent you a pile of crap."}
{"text":"Have not had the pizza in a while but my last two orders exhibited very poor quality ingredients (frozen, canned) and terribly over priced. Absolutely no pride taken in the final product the customer receives. This restaurant used to be a highlight of the neighbourhood and now it's hospital food to go. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Bon, j'avoue je ne suis pas objectif pour Connie. L'endroit, qui est une véritable institution dans Pointe St-Charle, me rappelle des soupers familiale de mon enfance. 
Lorsque nous  voulions nous gâter, mon père allait chercher (ou faisait livrer) la pizza de chez Connie. Bien grasse, avec une grosse croûte moelleuse, cette pizza me fait revivre des bons moments. Mais si je ne suis plus dans le quartier, j'y retourne de temps en temps par  nostalgie. Même si ce n'est pas l'endroit idéal pour manger sur place, le service est toujours aussi sympathique et l'on rit beaucoup. Un conseil, ne laisser pas un morceau... Vous vous le ferez dire :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ordered a medium Hawaian Pizza to-go.
It took about 15 minutes.

When we got the pizza, it had this little piece of bread in the middle of it. It kind of looked like a bird dropped \"it\" from the sky. I am not sure what the purpose of \"it\" was.

We had to cut the pizza ourselves because it was not sliced up good enough. The slices of ham... were not really slices. It looked like they just threw the big chunks of ham on top of the pizza and then cheese/pineapple on top of it.

As soon as we bit into the slices... we had to spit them out right away. I am not sure if they got the wrong sauce on our pizza, but the sauce tasted like an expired spaghetti sauce combined with meatball sauce. It was very sour and definitely.. NOT tasting good. Actually... it tasted AWFUL.

I will not go back to this place and will definitely not go back to argue with them about why my pizza was bad.

I hope this review makes you think twice before going to this place."}
{"text":"One of the best Greek greasy spoon pizza in Verdun. All dressed with meat sauce is the way to go. Verdunites pretty much all agree on this."}
{"text":"What is it with this town and pizza? If there are two things that Montreal does better than any other city this side of the Atlantic it's bread and cheese. Apparently those artisans are not speaking to the pizza folks, however. Time and again I'm reading rave reviews, having my hopes raised and being handed pizza that would be considered barely tolerable for the airport in any other city. 

Connie's is thick pizza. Not deep dish, just thick, and kinda cardboard-y and very greasy. They almost have a flavor to their pizza sauce so they get a star above the pizza in the subway but that's as far as I could go. If you're reading this and you have found pizza in this town you would willingly show a friend from say NYC, or even Chicago, please do message me and tell me where!"}
{"text":"Good neighborhood pizza joint! The first thing you need to know about Connie's is that it's a take out joint, they have tables but I'm not sure I would bother sitting at one of the like five tables they have in the place. It would be like trying to sit in any other small restaurant kitchen, hot and kind of cramped.

Connie's isn't a gourmet pizza joint it's a small independent pizza place, they make what I like to call dirty pizza. The word dirty in this case doesn't refer to the state of the kitchen but to the fact that this pizza isn't meant for anyone on a restricted calorie diet. The crust has a thick rim and a doughy almost soggy from the sauce bottom. The sauce isn't anything to write home about but it isn't like the Andrei F says it is, at worst I would accuse the sauce of being bland but not rancid. The toppings have always been sufficient, the pepperoni is bountiful and the cheese stacked high (sometimes too high). I think maybe when it comes to Connie's maybe you need to stick to the standards like pepperoni or all-dressed.

I can't say that this is the greatest pizza in the world but given a choice between Connie's and other pizza delivery restaurants, such as Domino's or Pizza Hut I'll take Connie's dirty pizza any day of the week. Just keep in mind that you're ordering from a fast food joint not a gourmet pizza place."}
{"text":"What can I say about Connie's pizza? It is quite possibly my favourite pizza EVER!

I always go for the Speciale or Super Speciale because the humongous amount of ingredients combined with the taste of the meat spaghetti sauce is just perfect.

Be prepared to pay a higher price but it is worth it. Connie's pizza is the stuff that naughty dreams are made of."}
