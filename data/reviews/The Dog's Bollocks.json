{"text":"Terrible service - Waited over 25 minutes for a chicken sandwich which never happened -  Service staff wasn't even busy - Not going back anytime soon.   Missing Gypsy Co-Op."}
{"text":"We were quite excited to try this place. A friend of mine was visiting from the UK, the booze and food were great prices, and people always look like theyre having fun. It's no frills but that's fine. Our problem came from having one of the ladies waitresses I've ever experienced. She just sat in the booth across from us talking to her friends. It wasn't even busy! I've worked in a restaurant for 5 years, I get it, but this was ridiculous. We ended up having to go to the bar for another pitcher because she was just sitting down ignoring her tables. It was pretty frustrating. We just wanted to drink. By the time we were done eating we just left instead of continuing to drink like we had planned since the service sucked so badly."}
{"text":"Only went there to pick up the breakfast special  The price is great, the food is pretty good  Haven't gotten the chance to enjoy alcohol or the bar snacks so my review remains at three stars"}
{"text":"I think this place served its purpose as a pub/bar.  The food was cheap and satisfying and the drinks were strong.  I got the buffalo chicken wrap, and was pleasantly surprised.  The buffalo taste was not the hot-saucy flavor that my American palette was used to.  It actually had a more Philadelphia chicken cheesesteak flavor, with onions and peppers and goodness!  I got a $4 shot concoction, which the bartender allowed me to swap out vodka for tequila (not my best decision).  I also got a half pitcher of margarita for $13. It's a typical bar setting- dim lighting and no frills with the exception of the several flat screens.  This definitely wasn't a dive bar.  The bar itself was clean, the bartenders were friendly, and there were chefs walking back and forth from the freezer with fresh produce.  I would definitely return here to pregame."}
{"text":"The first time I want to the colorfully titled \"Dog's Bullocks\" on Queen West it was the day before new year's eve. It was part of that one magical week between Xmas and New Years, where a lot of people are in from out of town, the stresses of Christmas time are over and people are wont to celebrate. It was also a friend's birthday, and sort of a prequel to new years eve, so drinks and merriment were the order of the day. I soon took full advantage of their $12 mixed drink pitcher special. A couple more of these were had, the touch-screen mp3-powers jukebox was pawed to near-death, and The rest of the night is sort of a blur. A wonderful, vodka induced blur.  The next time, however, was a little different. I walked in perhaps naively expecting the same merry atmosphere that had inhabited it a week or so prior, but instead got a nearly empty bar. Any bar can look like a utopia when it's full of people and the drinks flow cheaply, but the cracks in the veneer really start to show through when it's empty. The interior design stops short of classy, but isn't scummy enough to be quaint, so it kind of just lands on tacky. Another major factor for the Dog's Bullocks is it's size and wide-open layout. When it's empty it looks REALLY empty, and it feels more like you're at Bennigan's with your family, than at a smallish local pub trying to get shitfaced. Perhaps a layout change could help the bar seem more cozy? Might I suggest levels?  On my previous visit, a Vodka-7 pitcher was pretty much established as \"My drink\" at that bar, so thats what I ordered upon my return. It was poured for me, and I paid with a twenty. Then I waited. And kept waiting. Then I had no choice but to do one of those \"hey, yeah, listen, I know I'm getting sort of a deal here, but that doesn't mean you should take a presumptive $8 tip, guy\". I'm no stranger to tip etiquette, and I consider myself a pretty good tipper, but if theres one thing I hate about the whole thing is the presumptive tip. Don't make me get into what they say about when people assume things.  So my attitude on the place had soured after that little snafu. I soon came to learn it was Karaoke night, which can be fun if done right, even in the bar is mostly empty. I've learned the key is to have a host that basically triples everyone else's enthusiasm. Sadly, this host did not. He had a really holier-than-thou attitude, and a sarcastic, dark sense of humor. I'd be all over that kind of freshness in other instances, but when you're hosting an activity, you shouldn't be making people feel lame or uncool for simply participating. When I watch Karaoke, I want the host to bound out of his seat for an enthusiastic rendition of Kiss's \"I was made for Lovin' You\" and do Michael Jackson kicks between participants, not a seated, sedated, sarcastic hipster saying \"yeah. here's another song or whatever.\" It made the whole affair even more of a bummer.   In the scant few times I've been back at the behest of others, there's always been a hesitant pause at the doorway. It just doesn't look inviting or fun. So I guess if you need a wide open space to bring 20-30 friends, this might be the spot, but if you're looking for fun with a small group, there are plenty of better places close by.  Who knew a bar named after testicles wouldn't be a barrel of laughs?"}
{"text":"Horrible wait staff, my husband had a plate of wings dropped in lap and was still charged for his meal, no comp, nothing. The waitress told him that she already had to pay for the food she dropped and that the bar makes the waitstaff pay for mistakes out of their own pocket. When he called the restaurant afterwards the manager basically told him there are a lot if other places he can go to and the restaurant doesn't do anything for their patrons when the waitstaff dump food on them or screw up.  I guess repeat service is not a concern for them,  nor keeping their customers happy. Customer service at an all time low."}
{"text":"I'm confused about how to rate this place, but considering our tumultous relationship I shouldn't be surprised. The Dogs Balls (as I've heard it referred to) is one of those good times that you swear will never happen again, but somehow you're back with a mini-pitcher of Long Island Iced Tea, or a $10 Pitcher of Sapporo, singing along to the karaoke and ordering cheap wings. Or maybe that's just me.  To see what I'm talking about hit this spot up on a Thursday and watch all walks of life try to impress the miserable Bad Santa like DJ who runs the show."}
{"text":"I'm always here at weird times (in the middle of the day, generally :p), so maybe I don't have a completely accurate sense of this place, but I always have such a nice time when I'm here! The beer is pretty cheap, the food is edible bar food, and the atmosphere is really nice even when it's pretty empty."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with a couple of friends and ordered some food and beer, and when the food came, it tasted like some kind of disinfectant/bleach. We figured out it was coming off the plate so the bottom of my meal smelled strongly, and tasted awful.   I've never sent food back at a resaurant before, so just to be sure, everyone at my table had a taste to confirm how bad it was. When I told the waitress, she went to the kitchen and then came back to tell me they would remake my meal if I paid for both plates. I said I didn't want to do that (I ate some of my friends food instead). She ignored our table for the rest of the eve (40 minutes) even though our glasses were empty most of the time.  To be fair, they didn't charge me for the soapy eggs - I just had to go without my meal. I know it wasn't the waitresses decision, and she was apologetic about it, but what poor management to ask someone to pay for two plates of food when the first one was covered in soap. Clearly they rely on the prime location and walk-in traffic because they don't seem to care about their customers."}
{"text":"Absolute worst experience of my life. There was a clump of hair grilled into the burger. We found this because the burger bun was so stale and over grilled that it just crumbled after the first bite. The burger was overlooked and burnt. The bacon was obviously deep fried and it tasted like rancid old fryer grease. The wings tasted the same, and were cooked until they were rock hard. The onion rings were so soggy with cold grease it looked like someone had dipped them in water. We threw our entire meals in the garbage. Absolutely disgusting. The health inspector needs to look into this pub."}
{"text":"Rude staff try to rip you off. Pay for your drink at the bar so the servers can't overcharge you, and then tell the bouncer to kick you out before you can even finish your drink. They literally tried to take the drinks out of our hands while they caused a scene and shouted at us because we caught them overcharging us."}
{"text":"Honestly, there's not much to this place that I desire other than their $10 pitchers. But really, that's reason enough. The bar is pretty large, so it can accommodate large groups; one of their better spaces being a collection of couches in the centre of the bar. There are a number of televisions, but they were only playing golf and wrestling (blech). The service I received was subpar. We had to hunt down our waitress for our cheque after waiting for 20 minutes. She was talking to her friend about penises or something. The downstairs bathroom is super sketchy.   Still, $10 pitcher..."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night due to the reviews on the cheap drinks, I couldn't find any of the $12 dollar pitches people were talking about on their menu or their daily special menu. I had a pint of Amsterdam Natural Blonde for $5 which wasn't too bad. Maybe the mini pitchers were mentioned on some blackboard on the wall? I just couldn't find it. If you're interested, just ask the staff, they're extremely helpful and nice. The pitchers they had on their menu ranged from around $17 to $20. The cheapest bottle there they had was about $4.75. They didn't ID when we got there or ordered drinks, unlike what the other reviews mentioned, but we did go there early and they had a security guard there at the door later on in the night.   The staff were very friendly and kept checking up on us to make sure everything was okay and if we needed anything on top of what we already ordered. I ordered rib and wing combo to share with my boyfriend. The wings were big and were able to maintain its crunch while still being doused in sauce. I ordered honey hot and it wasn't too overly spicy for me but I didn't taste much of the honey. On the other hand, it was too spicy for my boyfriend which caused him to drink a lot of beer. Maybe it was a clever tactic! I wasn't a big fan of the ribs. They were done alright and fell off the bone but the sauce didn't make me want to go back for seconds.   The atmosphere itself was great. If you want to watch any games, they had a ton of TVs a few large ones. I also noticed on the daily special that they offered karaoke at 11 PM if you are a fan of that! This place doesn't have top notch food but the wings were definitely decently sized and flavourful. If you're looking for a place to just chill with your friends and kick back with some drinks, this would be a great place!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever. I can't believe how these people can be servers. We were there on a friday night and I understand it can be busy. So it was a seat yourself situation and we quickly found a seat at one of the tables . No one came to serve us. They didn't even acknowledge the fact that we were sitting there with no menu or anything on the table. It wasn't until 10-15 minutes that I finally decided to ASK one of the servers for a menu. After receiving the menu, we took a look at it and was hoping a server would come by and take our orders. We were watching the Blue Jays game and we managed to watch one whole inning and still no one came to serve us, not even the server that gave us the menu. I mean , it doesn't make sense for her to give us the menu and not follow up with what we want.. If she wasn't the server in charge of our table, she could have gotten the one that was to come serve us.There were servers walking by and collecting dirty plates from tables that were around us but still no one  took in the fact that we still had menus on the table . In the end, we just walked out without ordering anything. This wasn't our first time here but I guess you can't really expect much from a place like this and being served by people who are basically useless. At least the last time we were here, we got a chance to actually meet our server."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting my friends and about nine of us headed to this place for after-dinner drinks and to celebrate a friend's birthday. As the only person from the US, I wasn't allowed inside because they wouldn't accept my state ID (I'm 26, by the way). \"This could be fake.\" Oh really?  Are tourists expected to carry around their passports on a Friday night of partying and drinking? Needless to say, we all left and took our pick of the hundred other bars in the area. Thanks for the warm welcome!"}
{"text":"Came here on Thanksgiving weekend on a mini pub crawl that we did. Had a beer and some food, I got the steak frites; the steak was good but the bread was a little bit too overdone and crispy. They had the football game on and some random tv shows which was cool. Definitely recommended for big groups."}
{"text":"This place has a ton of character with a name to fit. Right down to the trough in the bathroom. Booze and food are cheap. The food is quite reasonable, their wings are quite good, their sweet potato fries are yummy. This is by no means a gourmet restaurant and staff are interesting to say the least. If your looking for a cheap bar with typical pub grub it might be the place for you. This will never be a happening place to see or be seen ... Perhaps this will give the Brunni a run for it's money! I wonder what it would take to get thrown out of the place ... hmmmm."}
{"text":"Cheap Booze- 10$ for half a pitcher of vodka cranberry (3 shots)   Great Waitress- Every request was met with enthusiasm of a \"HELLZ YEAH, YOU CAN HAVE FRIES!\" level  Fries- The good, greasy kind served piping hot  Bathrooms- Downstairs, hard to find, kinda scary when alone   Vibe- Bumping, loud, fun   Arnold Schwarzenagger- Using his words, I'll be back  Not the classiest establishment your fine self will ever grace but good times!"}
{"text":"I came here on an extremely cold day with a couple friends, just trying to get out of the cold and grab something simple and cheap to eat! No problem! We get into the pub and there are 3 people at the bar and a 4 top sitting on the one end but in total the place is nearly empty! We sit down in a booth and have a look at the menu- traditional pub food and an alright draught list.  Our server was Irish and very friendly. and we had our drinks quickly.  I was unimpressed with the unmatched glassware. I had a Magners (came with a SteamWhistle glass with ice) and my girlfriend had a Canadian in a Guiness glass. I had a bit of a laugh since at the pub I work at we are super OCD on glassware which I love.. Haha. Anyhow, our soups come out and we get about 2 bites in then our entrees come! No biggie, we noticed one guy in the kitchen so he was probably just rushing to get other work done.  I have a look at my salad and see some greyish, dried up meat, I think it was turkey? I was kinda grossed out but just picked it out and continued on my salad. It was okay but I just stuck to the soup. We all finished up our foods and drinks and just chatted up a bit while we waited for our bill to come. We were the only table left in the restaurant at this point with 3 people at the bar. We tried to get the servers attention but she was leaning against the bar chatting with those patrons.  We heard the bell ring in the kitchen for food and FINALLY were able to catch the servers attention while she was getting her food to get our bills. We paid and left. Overall I was not impressed with the service or the food. The prices are good but thats about it. I dont have any interest in going back."}
{"text":"Well past its prime. This place use to be a great hole in the wall with cheap beer, cheap food and great staff. The owner has lost his mind. He's raised the price on everything, slashed the selection of beer that qualifies for drink specials, raised the price of food and charges for everything for sauce on the side to mayo. $1 for mayo!   Blow me buddy."}
{"text":"Dive bar delight! I had fun on my first and only visit to the Dog's Bollocks. My friends and I wandered in late for a friend's birthday, and we partook of much beer and birthday cake. Karaoke was on in full force, which provided great entertainment. I do think the set up of this place is a little inconvenient. The tables are long and very close together, which makes it hard to get up and move around, particularly if its your turn at the mic. Which brings up the second drawback: karaoke faces sideways, so the singer will stare at a wall instead of his or her audience. While I understand the practicality, it still feels odd to watch someones right side for the entirety of their performance. Ah well. It was a good night!"}
{"text":"Just left here after waiting 10 minutes at a dirty table to order a drink. Place is maybe 1/3 full. Something is gravely mismanaged here. Not the first time."}
{"text":"Honestly, great place when I was on the inside.  Lovely waitstaff who honestly didn't come by often enough but was apologetic about it so I appreciate it.  What got me was when I left me and my friends left we were standing outside and a gentlemen with a shaved head and hoody came out and told us to move along from the sidewalk for no real reason other than \"the law dictates it is time to clean the sidewalk\".  Clearly I challenged this, as a colleague of his yelled at me derogatory comments about the fact I was not of his race and in a suit.  The amusing part was I was in a blazer and jeans and not really as corporate as he hoped I was.  I wasn't happy, yelled an insult back and moved on.  I was extremely insulted and will listen to his advice and move on from \"his neighbourhood\" as he put it.  The Dog's Bullocks is a great pub but ruined by a few extreme individuals making it a very uncomfortable experience.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Easily one of my top spots in the city. Super cheap pitchers and easily the best suicide hot wings around. I find myself back there on a weekly basis and while there's no doubt that it will one day kill me - it's worth it.  I'm fresh in from the UK and that kind of 'we don't give a sh#t' attitude pub was what I feared I would miss the most. With DB, problem solved."}
{"text":"This is one of the many dive pubs on Queen Street West, and seems to have recently started getting more busier.  There is no space to move around here, a massive amount of tables fill the place and as you can guess on UFC nights they really fill up.   The food is okay here for what its worth and the service friendly. My favourite thing about this place is the $10 jugs they do of liquor mixes. Crowd is kind of mixed depending when you go but you will always have a good time here if in a group."}
{"text":"The fries were good. Everything else was terrible, in terms of food and service. I ordered the roast beef sandwich and waited while my waitress socialized with her friends. She sat down for 10 minutes at least and didn't give a damn about her job. Horrible food + bad service. Only redeeming quality is the karaoke lol"}
{"text":"I can't even give this place a proper review because when I came here with my friends they sat us down with the menus and literally ignored us for 40 minutes. We weren't even able to put an order in. We kept on trying to get the attention of the servers walking around but I don't know if they just pretended not to see or they were actually paying that little attention to their guests. It wasn't even that busy. There were only a couple other tables in our area. There were groups of people that came in after us and got their orders taken and drinks served while we were just sitting there waiting for them. Like I work in a restaurant too so it's just mind blowing that you could ignore a table in your section so hard that they sit there for 40 minutes waiting to order. Like if it took 40 minutes for the food to come I could understand that more. But just to take our orders???? We ended up leaving because we were staving and didn't want to wait any longer and just went to get pizza from pizza pizza."}
{"text":"Service was good. Beer was cheap ($11 for a pitcher of Canadian). They play the game sound rather than shitty music, which is a plus.   Chicken wings - the worst I've ever had. Definitely cheap frozen wings thrown in a fryer for a few minutes. Ordered 2 lbs ($20), got 12 1/2 wings. Charred, dry, almost tasteless wings with barely any sauce on them.   Eat somewhere else. Come at game-time for the beer."}
{"text":"Nice place to watch the game. Good atmosphere when it gets pretty busy.  Communal style tables. I don't love the food here all that much but the beer selection is good and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Went for some drinks and nibblies last night and really liked this place. I was tuned off it a few years ago when we wanted to come in and have a drink but it was during a UFC fight and they wanted us to pay $20 cover each for standing room. we weren't gonna go for that.  But last night was really fun! Pitchers are cheap and I quite enjoyed my vodka sodas. The other three in our party arrived before me and were sharing the same pitchers, without asking, the server put me on a separate tab. I got there a little late to sample the nachos, but I ordered some Calamari and it was pretty good.  The menu had all the pub classics like wings, nachos, potato skins burgers and sandwiches etc.. but I was pleased to see that they had old school classics like Liver and Onions and a large selection of curries.  The set up is great for large groups and I can see this being a good place to come and catch a World Cup game this summer."}
{"text":"Great wings, personal pitchers of cocktails and a fight? What's not to love?  We came here for UFC (okay, my companions came here for UFC, I came for drinks and hangouts). I had an order of suicide wings which was surprisingly: flavourful, actually spicy, accompanied with fries, 50% for some reason! This was on a Saturday. So yes, fan of their wings. I also liked that you could get a small pitcher with a straw of any cocktail. I'm a big fan of giant cocktails.  The place was good for the fight, with screens all over the place. The only problem is maybe the crowd. Most of the people there are in their early to mid twenties and a fight broke out at some point near the door.   Oh, and also it's really really cold near the door and garage door/front wall.   Might come back again, if only for the wings and drinks."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and this is an awesome bar to watch the UFC fights. I wish they'd put the volume up for the Leafs game today though, but I guess because there are other games going on on the other tv's it makes sense that they didn't. For that reason, I wouldn't recommend coming to watch a leafs, jays or tfc game, but if you're a large group and all of you want to watch different games at once, and you don't mind not hearing the commentary, then this bar is your go to. Our server was new, so she forgot a several things, but she was very kind and friendly. The crowd at both times were awesome. High energy, loud and spirited. The servings are huge so the food is really good value, and the drinks are a good deal too. I recommend sharing the mighty kings combo. This shared platter is massive, good for at least three people which is an awesome value. The burgers are also massive and cooked to your preference. They have vegetarian items on the menu, and I'd say there's a bit of something for everyone, whether you're craving pub food, something a bit lighter, or something Asian or Indian. Come early to get a table and to avoid cover charges."}
{"text":"Can't say I'm a fan of this place anymore.  It used to be a cheap place for beer and food but now the prices have gone up and the food quality has gone down.  The poutine isn't the greatest and the portion sizes have gone down in recent times.  The decor isn't the most appealing, inside or out.  I suppose if you're just getting a beer it's alright but I wouldn't recommend the food."}
{"text":"Half price wings and cheap apps 4 nights a week. They are some of the best in the city too. Try the \"house\" sauce. It's a secret sauce, well worth it. Cheapest pitchers around!"}
{"text":"+Cheap beer +Great deals on food +Decent pub food +Wings are good +TV's everywhere +Giant Screen in the middle excellent for watching sports"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. 4/7 Half priced wings?!? and they're truly awesome. The staff is great even when it's busy. Lots of big screens to watch the game... and Karaoke a couple nights  a week is entertaining when drunk.   Anyway... once in a while there is a smell, but it goes away in like 10 minutes. Totally the spot for my softball team."}
{"text":"Honestly I liked this place. The waitstaff was friendly and the food was alright. It got bonus points because it had footy and Setanta on!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a fellow yelper's birthday, and to my surprise, I really liked it. As someone who doesn't frequent this side of downtown a lot, it really surprised me.   This place ID-ed us as soon as we walked in, which means if you're not 19.. don't think about it! Kinda like this idea and wish more bars would do so, because I hate bars with rowdy underagers. The dive bar has an 'old' vibe and you can definitely tell who the regulars are. Service is pretty good, even though we were a large table- they were extremely courteous and brought everything out as soon as they could & kept checking on us. Shoutout to Sasha, you did an amazing job with splitting the bill and doing everything in a timely order. They have specials every night and the friday night ones were amazing! I saw a steak sandwich there for $9, and expected some cheapy, small portioned beef patty jammed between a small english muffin, or something. To my surprise, the plate was so big, I could've sat on it. Seriously! There were so many fries that accompanied my meal AND the steak that was between my sandwich was HUGE. I was so full! We also had indian poutine and it was amazing. I could've been selfish and eaten the whole thing by myself. The butter chicken sauce on it.. holy shit, that was the bomb. They also have cheap beer, which is a plus.  Cool place actually, they also host karaoke and have a billiards/pool table."}
{"text":"Good, cheap place to watch sports. Nice selection of pitchers at good prices.   Food is as mediocre as you'd expect for the price, which is fair, though they do go a bit nuts with the salt ... the wings especially. I get that salt makes people drink faster, but man, cut that salt in half and you'd have a decent wing.  My only other beef is taps and draught lines need to be cleaned more often. I've had  a few drinkable but questionable pitchers there.  Still, a good regular pub for watching the game, really friendly and efficient staff, half decent food, lots of space for a crowd and ample TVs with game sound. In this neighbourhood, there aren't many spots to watch a Leafs game. Does what you need -- you won't impress a date here, but it's a good, cheap, chill place to meet up with friends and have a few drinks on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Cheap pitchers, tons of seats, inexpensive yet non-offensive food. Oh and many massive TVs.   Watch stuff here during the playoffs for anything and you'll have a good time.  That's about it."}
{"text":"The food was really good!  But I wasn't satisfied with the service.  I liked the Mediterranean wrap so much that I showed it to my friends who follow me on Instagram.    However, when my friends ordered a club soda and a beer, they received it within 5 minutes after ordering.  But I had to wait 15 minutes for TAP WATER!  I understand it was a Saturday night, it was crowded... etc. etc but it shouldn't take 15 minutes to turn on a faucet, fill a glass and add ice cubes.  Filling a glass with tap water is not even a 5 minute job.    I'm sorry you have to read this."}
{"text":"This place replaced Gypsy Co-op. It seems a bit more like a pub thenGypsy Co-op ever was. The menu is typical British pub food: butter chicken, bangers and mash, etc. I had a grilled cheese sandwich when I went, which was good -- though really, how do you mess that up? The interior isn't flashy, but it's functional. There is lots of space, chairs, etc. It's a good place to go if you're meeting up with a big group. Anyway, the big appeal for this place is that they have 10$ pitchers of beer. What else do you really need?"}
{"text":"I really miss Gypsy Co-op. Since that place shut down this location seems to have struggled with finding a good replacement. They had some place called The Legend which seemed to last about a month.  Now we have the Dog's Bollocks, which has to be one of the worst names I've ever heard. Who wants to hang out in a place called the Dog's Bollocks let alone mention the name to friends? They are definitely going for a pub vibe on this one but the place is way too sparse and bright to be considered inviting. I am all for pubs and would love a good one on Queen Street (I really miss the Bishop & The Belcher) but this place just ain't cutting it.  Last time I went they had $10 pitchers which is a good deal anyway you cut it. Though it seems this place has cornered the market on 19-year olds who think the name Dog's Bollocks is amusing. It smells funny and the washrooms are a complete mess.  I've never ate here but the whole building smells deep-fried."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for wings and to watch sports.  They also have free karaoke on Thursday.  They have a lot of screens all around the restaurant so getting a good seat with a good view is easy.  There are many passionate sports fans that visit and is fun cheering with them when the home team is playing.  They have half price wings almost every day unless they have a special event that night.  The wings are much bigger than most places I been to and are crispy and juicy.  They also come with fries and veggies at no extra cost but you have to buy a drink if you want half price wings.  They have about 10 sauces and I'd recommend the hot and honey."}
{"text":"good joint for cheap beer and food.  I like the loungers it has and the big spaciousness of the pub, although you can never find a seat because it's so full.  Good times here during Kareoke night - but I always find that the music is fairly lound and you can't quite have a conversation - until you're drunk and yelling.  Food is pretty decent but on the pricier side as well.  What I don't get is why this place is listed in Yelp as being in the Niagara neighbourhood??"}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend and three other friends for my birthday on Jan. 10th (Saturday night) - 5 people total for those who are mathematically challenged.   I thought it was UFC night (guess not!) and figured it wouldve been packed but it really wasnt at all - we had a HUGE 12+ seater table in the middle of the room to ourselves. Everytime the door opened i got a cold bum draft but whatever.   Anyways... was pretty nice. Our server was a seriously foxy redhead. Super friendly, I'm sorry i forgot her name though. :(  My best friend and I ordered these huge mix drink pitchers for $10-13 depending on what they were. Hers were gin and tonic and it was a proper G&T (not made with sprite). I had a rum and DC and then a ceaser (my fave!) when I saw another table order it - that was the $13 one. They just add a lot of ice so next time I will ask for less to get more drink.  I ordered the biggest platter they had for $35 for all of us to share. It came with calamari, wings, garlic bread, potato skins, onion rings, veggies, fries and four dipping sauces... it fed all of us pretty darn well for the price.   We also did some shots and when I was leaving our server came up and gave me a free shot.   All in all a cool chill cheap birthday place which is exactly what I wanted. :)"}
{"text":"Friendly server, but service stopped by the end of the meal and quite possibly the worst fish and chips I've ever had. And they were $15. Terrible."}
{"text":"Good times were had at the Dog's Bollocks. Our server was an absolute delight and the pitchers were great. Although it's basically just a dive bar where you can watch sports, it was dry and clean and totally cozy on a rainy day. A friend and I shared a pitcher in the midday and we were one or two or three parties in the place. It was a great spot, but nothing to write home about, really. :)"}
{"text":"Recently went and checked this place this place out with a good friend. He was itching for wings, I was just plain hungry. The price is more than right! We got 2lbs of wings ( 8 wings per lb), each pound came with a side order of fries. A poutine was about 5 bucks but, if you get a side, you get a burger for 99 cents! Price wise it was outstanding. Our bill came to $19.45! These weren't dried out firkin wings either. I didn't drink but they had cheap beer and rail booze. Hungry and on a budget go here. Want to get drunk for cheap at a bar go here. Check it out.    PS  Guys careful when in the washroom the piss trough is kinda shallow and reeks of mothballs. Get ready."}
{"text":"Cheap pitchers are always a good draw and the dogs bollocks certainly has those, and props for not just having the cheap stuff being Molson and Labatt swill, we had pitchers of Amsterdam Vienna Lager, which was tasty.  Service was good, however the music was terrible.  Dubstep is fine for clubs but really annoying when trying to have a pitcher and conversation.   Food was OK, my friend ordered all day breakfast at 12:30 am which he said was good, while the munchies were average.  Honestly if it wasn't for the cheap pitchers I wouldn't see a reason to go, but cheap pitchers get significant brownie points.  Oh, and advice to the good folks of the Dog's Bollocks, pleasse clean out your taps more often, the beer tasted a bit off."}
{"text":"So let's call a spade a spade. This dive bar is very much a college hangout, but I certainly was not put off by the demographics.  I went Friday night, by myself, for karaoke. The set-up was odd, the \"stage\"is in the middle of the floor, but the sound quality was really good. The crowd was really into it and the calibre of singers was amazing.  I ordered a rum and coke and was asked if I would rather have a mini pitcher. Meh, why not, so I ordered one. Never again! The idea is wonderful but I was destroyed before the night even got really started. In fact, there were LOTS of drunk people, which probably added to my enjoyment. People watching is great at Dog's Bollocks.  The staff was wonderful, very pretty and fun girls working the bar. Very polite and didn't kick me out or cut me off no matter how tipsy-wipsy I was. I did drink lots of water too though.  I would recommend this bar to anyone who is looking for something a bit punk rock. The karaoke was amazing and the people were lovely."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars. I can't comment on the food - the general cleanliness of the place inspires me to stick to drinks only - the place actually stinks. Literally. The crowd seems to be mostly students and very low maintenance hipsters. The karaoke DJ is awesome - good sense of humour and plenty of selection. Karaoke night amazingness compensates for the vile washroom stench"}
{"text":"This place was a nice finish to a Saturday relaxing at Trinity Bellwoods. Before heading home we stopped here with some friends for a pitcher of beer. Not realizing how cheap the pitchers were. $10 pitchers, yes please! I'll take a few (for the group ;). Makes you feel not so bad about drinking beer. We kept asking for the bill, we'd pay, and then order one more pitcher. It became an ongoing joke with our server. She just kept assuming we'd take another.   Service here was awesome! That being said, we were one of many 5 tables, and we were our server's only table...so she was very attentive to us. We did ask her if it does ever get busy here, because they do appear to have a lot of seating, to which she said that some nights it's standing room only.   I imagine this place would be really great to come to if you're a sports fan and enjoy watching games on a big screen. There were several here.   I was impressed by this bar. I was impressed by the service - I am mindful, however, at empty it was. Sure, I'll go again if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"$12 for a pitcher! What!! Its my second time here but I cant remember if the food was that good. I guess it wasnt memorable? Easily forgettable? Anyways, servers were entertaining. Would I go back? Maybe for the drinks."}
{"text":"I had a vodka tonic, and Sex on the beach, and both were A-OK. As others have mentioned, the pitchers are cheap. The servers aren't keen on, well, serving. The food is surprisingly good- I had the Thai Spring rolls(mmm!), and my friend ordered wings, which, according to him, were excellent. A good fallback place on any night of the week if you aren't expecting too much. Great place to get together with a group of friends, and be as loud as you want."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place? It doesn't try to be anything beyond what it exactly is - a no hassle dive bar. Let the cheap booze flow and inhibitions be left at the door!"}
{"text":"Might be the worst food of all time. This place is trash ordered nachos and the cheese was grated not melted. Bits of lettuce everywhere. Nachos were stale and cold. 10/10 would not recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick drink and a small bite to eat. Came in the half price wings day. Pitchers were priced well and service can't complain. The flavours of wings were good with a variety. The menu has your typical bar food and also the added touch of south Asian cuisine. Overall the location is good as I frequent queen street often."}
{"text":"Lots of screens here, great for watching sports.  However they don't take reservation unless you're a regular here.  The food menu offers a good variety, but I only had a glass of Caesar, a tad on the hot side and not much alcohol.  Drinks seem cheap here, nice casual hang out spot for big groups."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the DB will be on your list of pit stops if you're planning on doing a bar crawl down Queen St West.   It doesn't look pretty outside, and it isn't much better on the inside either. Drinks are uber cheap though and one of the few that sells mini pitchers of your favourite bar rail for around $10. They even have a pool table in the back, as well as a song machine if you want to get cray cray.   They have a few screens going for the game and usually have the latest UFC/boxing matches on the big screen. They charge cover though on the popular ones which can be a turn off if you just want to grab a pint and some wings.   Food isn't terrible, but don't expect five star gourmet. Wings are actually top notch, as well as the shared platters.   Sweats and a ball cap, a couple 20's, and you'll be livin' it up at the Bollocks!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday for takeouts. Surprisingly, they had their 1/2 priced wings special with a drink purchase. The drink does not have to be alcoholic and the deal also applies to takeouts as some places only have deals for dine-in.   I got 2 lbs of wings and a coke for a total of ~16$ - not to mention the wings came with fries. I got the sweet chilli thai and the house sauce flavours. I enjoyed the house sauce more because it was different - a hint of sweetness + spicyness and tarty from a bbq sauce that they used. The wings were big and full of flavour.  The pub seems to have a lot of drink specials (written on their walls) and a good place to watch sports and hangout as they have multiple tvs, 2 big projector screens and a pool table"}
{"text":"This place is divey and didn't really have any redeeming qualities to make me enjoy it, besides the cheapish drink prices.  Was here on a Friday evening. The place is huge inside and pretty ghetto/unclean. It annoys me that it tries to be a British pub from the outside, but is really just a divey student hangout indoors with no traditional pub decor. Lots of huge tables big enough to fit groups of 20-30 people.   Seems to cater to the 19-24 year old crowd. They had karaoke going on down the far end, which was loud enough to make it impossible to have a conversation with my friend even from the entire opposite end of the bar.   Service was okay but not great. Mixed drinks were cheap. Would probably have enjoyed this place more 10 years ago."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food here, but I recently went to watch a finals game, and can comfortably say two things.  There are TVs everywhere, so there isn't a bad seat in the place if you are going to watch sports. There is both group seating at picnic style tables, and coffee tables and couches. It's very comfortable, and a great venue for a group of people (provided you don't come in the middle of a game looking for group seating).  Cheap beer and drinks. Mixed drink and beer pitchers start at $10, and move upward depending upon brand or type. Which is nice for people on budget, but allows for those who are willing to spend more to do so.  And finally, during the summer, the garage door style front window opens up to the street, with streetside seating for people watching and fresh (ish) air.  It's not a swank joint. It's named the Dog's Bollocks, for chr*st sakes. But it's comfortable, has lots of TVs and a substantial and reasonably priced drink selection. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"So this is the place that took over Gypsy Co-op. The outside is a little different, but the inside is basically the same -- they sure didn't change the rotten wood floors.  Besides that, they've installed tons of booths lined with your typical pub velvet, they have a convincing pub atmosphere with lots of flat-screen TVs and vintage beer posters on the walls.  Menu-wise, it has selections similar to a pub in England. They have liver pie on the menu but they also offer a huge assortment of pub fare that more of us are able to stomach. Wings, ribs, nachos, fries, all the standards are covered. But they also have a surprisingly good selection of Indian/Thai food, and I've heard their butter chicken is great.  On our trip here, we got some yam fries (pretty good), chicken wings (not spicy or crispy enough) and a salad that was on special for $3.99 (standard). The food didn't impress me much but the beer sure did. $10 pitchers of Amsterdam and Steamwhistle, about 12 beers on tap (including Strongbow and Sapporo, two of my favourites), and a huge drink menu full of cocktails you can get pitchers of for $7. Wow.   I may come back here just to try every kind of beer they offer. Although I wouldn't ask for wine -- there was an obnoxious singing birthday party table in the booth next to us, and one of the divas asked for a bottle wine. The waitress obviously had to go fetch one of the two bottles they had hidden in the back somewhere and then had to ask one of the guys in the party to help her open it. But I can't blame her -- this is a beer place, skip the wine.  All in all, a decent place -- Sneaky Dee's is definitely better food-wise but the Dog's Bollocks has them beat for beer.  OH and beware the washrooms -- they obviously have not changed or cleaned them since the place was sold. So so so gross."}
{"text":"What to try?  Come on Thursday evenings and enjoy half price wings for $7.99 with the purchase of a drink of course!! For a pound, that's a really good price and the entree includes fries and veggie sticks for their price tag!!   Last tip?  They don't have an extensive list of flavors to choose from for the wings. You have the traditional flavors to choose from only. But there are one or two unique flavors.  The unique flavors you might want to try are curry and their house sauce."}
{"text":"Ate here lastnight because it was the only place in the vicinity that was still serving food past midnight.  The food was tasty, decently priced and the servings were generous! The service was also friendly and efficient. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place with some friends while walking around Queen Street in Toronto. We wanted to try this place because of the $10 pitchers of selected draft beer and cocktails. That's right, you can have a pitcher of rum and coke, or gin and ginger ale, or vodka something...you get the point. The food is average but all we got were snacks last time we were there. I am yet to try it for dinner. I would recommend going here to get a good deal on drinks!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Place is empty. Empty beer sat on the edge of the table for 20 minutes!! The waitresses were all sitting and eating, just chatting to each other. Absolutely ridiculous. The only person actually doing their job here is the bartender. Everybody else is lazy and texting. What the heck?! It's dinner time, get on your feet and serve me food.. PLEASE!! I'm leaving and going somewhere else. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Time for lil' update:  The Dog's Bollocks was open on Labour Day, and we popped in for some food. It was salty and meh, but the booze prices remain great, and this unassuming place didn't judge us for anything. Not our childish food orders, not our pitchers of cocktails and not having our baby with us (playing on the table and then sleeping in her stroller).   Thank you, D's Bs."}
