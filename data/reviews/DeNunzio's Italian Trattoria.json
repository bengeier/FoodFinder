{"text":"A big party tonight and they apparently can't handle a crowd.  It was so noisy in the party room where they tried to seat us.  We asked for a table in another room and were treated with disrespect while left standing at the register.  The host was very testy when we inquired what was happening.  I am done with DeNunzios and was a frequent customer."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop for a wine or to have a nice meal.  Their flat bread pizzas are awesome!  My favorite things aren't even on the menu - pasta primavera and calamari fra diavolo.  The chefs are very accommodating and the waitresses have good ideas for tweaking an order to your liking.  They have great specials that change monthly.  I can't explain the one bad rating this place received.  I have eaten many meals at this restaurant and have NEVER had a bad one.  I can highly recommend Denunzio's."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 6 p.m. for 5 people for a birthday dinner celebration.  We walked in, and it was so odd because nobody acknowledged us.  The desk is very close to the front door.  The guy behind the desk was scurrying around, but pretended we weren't there.  A few people were also standing around, but within 60 to 90 seconds they were seated and we were the only ones in this small area.  I decided I would stand close and face the front of the desk so that my intention could not be mistaken.   He continued about his business, never looking at me.  Tired of standing, my mother-in-law and I sat on the nearby glider, discussing this weird situation.    We were amazed at how busy this place was because it was still early.  Finally we learned that the restaurant was unaware that it was opening night for the local high school play.  People were eating here before attending the play.  We believe the guy behind the front desk was embarrassed that they had given away tables that should have been reserved.  Never did he apologize or offer us a drink or suggest that we could sit at the bar.  I believe we should have been offered something, even free dessert.    Forty minutes later we were seated.   Well, enter the picture our frazzled waitress.  She did not hide her stressed demeanor.  We waited a very long time for bread and drinks.  When she finally arrived with the tray of drinks, she informed us they were out of pinot noir!  Really?  Better have a talk with the person who does inventory.  We then chose merlot.  The wine was too sweet, not at all like a merlot and it was served in the wrong glass.  Not a red wine stemware glass.  This was one of those little bulb glasses and probably doesn't even hold 4 ozs.    The menu is large but run of the mill.  Nothing progressive or different.  Lots of the old standards such as veal marsala and veal romano.  I ordered the chicken carciofi.  It lacked flavor.  I added some salt and pepper and cheese, but this couldn't help the flavor.  My husband ordered a pasta special and it was flavorful.   I did order the Ronnie chopped salad and enjoyed it.   I still cannot believe the behavior of the front desk guy and will never return."}
{"text":"We were at Olive Garden and the wait was going to be 30 minutes so I decided to give this place a try as I once heard someone comment about this place  Very, Very Disappointed. I would have given it 0 stars but was unable to. Our waitress Jane was obviously in a hurry, for as we were ordering our drinks, she asked if we were ready to order. We, my girlfreind and I, both ordered the same thing, Ronnie's trio, Chicken Parm, Raviolis (2), and Fetticini Alfredo. We also ordered the special salad. The salad took a while to come, as did my beer. We were barely into the salad when our food came, the look of it not very appealing, and the portions were small. Upon taking our first bite, the food was barely warm. I looked up to see 2 other tables being served and steam was rising from their plates. I spoke to Jane about the cold food and she said with an attitude \" I don't see how that could be\". She then asked my girlfriend about her food and she also said her's was barely warm. She took the plates and said she would be back. Upon her return, there was barely an apology for the condition of our food, a rushed \"sorry bout that\" was all she said. More cheese had been added and placed in a microwave and heated just enough to be a little warmer that when it left the table. As we were both very hungry we ate what was in front of us, a very tasteless meal. except for the salad, which we paid extra for. I am not sure why I didn't ask to see the manager, I guess I just wanted to get out of there. This just happened tonight, Sunday, April 22nd. I have written reviews on other places, both good ones and unfavorable ones, and this is the worst review that I have ever had to write. There is a reason why Olive Garden has a 30 minute wait on a Sunday evening."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere ... Attentive wait staff.  Last time there the waitress forgot our soups ... When they brought our meals I told the waitress to take the soups of our check... She was very apologetic and insisted on bringing the soups and not charging us for them.  Only way it could be better is if they had Guinness beer on draft!"}
{"text":"We just love this place!  Ravioli Night is wonderful.  Tuesday night, you cannot go wrong. They're expanding, Sunday Brunch coming soon!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed this place has really gone downhill are used to get takeout here a lot. But the last couple times my meals were absolutely awful. Just ordered spaghetti and meatballs and it turned out to be one meatball and sauce about the consistency of water on noodles.  I think I am done ordering from this place"}
{"text":"Not what I remember...  It's been a couple years since I last visited Denunzio's.  Was hoping to refresh a memorable dining experience from the past.   Unfortunately, this time did not sit as well as the last...  Pros: Service was very prompt.  Hostess and waitress were very friendly.  Bread was fresh, yeasty, and crusty the way I love it.  The somewhat \"wet\" salad was okay, but the perfect bleu cheese dressing that seemed homemade (with not too much bite) certainly made up for that.  Cons: While the decor was nice, the wall where we were seated was stained with sauce(?) and was visited by a couple annoying fleas during our meal.   The spaghetti (in the spaghetti with meat sauce dish) was terribly overcooked with swelled noodles that looked like (and I'm told tasted like) they had been in water for quite some time.    The recommendation of my waitress was the gnocchi with filet tips and mushroom wine sauce for me.  Sounded awesome.  Advice:  If you \"...eat with your eyes, first...\" as the saying goes, you should forget this dish.  In addition to being not very visually appealing, the gnocchi were also over cooked and quite slimy.  The under cooked mushrooms in the sauce were al dente -- with a \"bite\" that I wish had been present in my guest's spaghetti (and my gnocchi, too, for that matter).  The scant \"filet\" tips were very dry, overcooked, and several pieces contained tough gristle -- not what I'd expect of filet -- tips or otherwise.  The beef and wine sauce on the gnocchi was way too thick and had that raw flour after taste that the mild hint of wine was unable to mask.  Folks, I don't complain about food during my meal or send it back.  And I never under-tip the wait staff.  Perhaps that's wrong, but it's who I am.  Rather, I simply don't go back.  There are lots of restaurants in the greater Pittsburgh area.  Denunzio's had a chance to win me over all over again, but these two meals were not what someone should prepare and serve at an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner tonight at Denunzio's.  This was our second visit here and loved the quality of the food as much this time as we did the first.  My husband had veal Marsala, my mother in law had chicken Alfredo, and I had meat ravioli with a meatball.  Everyone raved about their dishes.  Denunzio's wedding soup which came with our orders (soup or salad) was the best we had ever had.  We like it so much we bought two take home containers.  We topped off the dinner with a large bowl of spamamoni ice cream which we shared.     The service st the restaurant was very good.  Our waitress made suggestions and was very at tentative to us.   Prices were reasonable and plenty of food!  We get to Pittsburgh a few times a year and this restaurant will be one we will be gong back too!"}
{"text":"Okay place for a family meal, if you don't mind a wait.  Big amounts of food that are perfect for our 20yo and 16yo boys.  Our service is never really good here, and my kids always remind me that when we enter the door.  True to that, last night the waitstaff was busy, and seemed to get huffy when we asked to refill the drinks!     The banana peppers stuffed with crab are always good, our boys liked the fried calamari--although they tasted like nothing special to me!  House and Caesar salads were fresh and satisfying.    I ordered a personal pizza.  The pizza crust was nice and crispy, the way I liked it--but they were skimpy with the toppings (I even had them take off the prosciutto that was listed on the menu, and replace it with additional veggies--they charged me!)    The boys had sandwiches, an Italian panini and buffalo chicken--they ate them without complaint (so I guess they were good!).  Our daughter had the fettuccine alfredo, which was creamy and delicious.  My husband got the scallop/pasta dish with hot banana peppers.  It was huge with plenty of fresh scallops and loaded with flavor.    After reading what I wrote--I would actually give this place 2.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner for my 2nd trip to monroeville! My server Dana was very quick, attentive and helpful. Loved the tiger shrimp, polenta, red pepper, feta and northern bean entree. Nice sized portions. Bread comes with dinner, if you like. Raviola special at the last visit was delicious as well. Blizzard cappuccino for dessert with fresh whipped cream, yum ;-) nice atmosphere, very popular place, perfect tag team service, not intrusive. Old style 50sish music, romantic darkish lighting, comfortable booths where i sat. A candle on the tables would be my only request, otherwise perfect! Check it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Wow...this was fun. Very charming atmosphere....the kind that major chains attempt to replicate but can't. Food was nice. Salad was a little disappointing - which leads to the 4 star meal. Stuffed pepper pasta dish was phenomenal....have emailed 4 friends already telling them to make the pilgrimage here. Spicy / tangy / savory is my personal wheelhouse and I want to get 4 take out portions to bring back to Minnesota with me. As much as I'll try to replicate this dish at my house, in no way will I hit the yummy spicy goodness of mama working over the stove like we had here."}
{"text":"I haven't dined in in years so I can't speak to the service or ambience at the restaurant. I have got their delivery through UberEats, and anywhere that will deliver both hot wedding soup and a frozen, old fashioned pecan ball in less than 30 min gets some stars in my book..We were not overly impressed with the Italian entrees for the price. Since they do have a varied menu, next time I would like to try sandwiches or entree salads."}
{"text":"BEST WEDDING SOUP EVER! CAN EVEN TAKE SOME TO GO!  This is a great family run Italian Eatery in Monroeville not far from the Turnpike and the hospital. The food is tasty but the real plus of this place is the specials. They know the average family is looking to save a little cash and still have fun so they offer week night specials that really appeal to all!   Menu Fav: Wedding Soup"}
{"text":"Well time to tell you how I ordered a takeout pasta sampler extra bread and sauce. This was May 11,2018 at 3:45pm-4:00 ish. I go their all the time food is good so when in Monroeville I stop and get take out well I had $424.00 to $500:00 in cash needed a new weedwacker and mower. When you call   They ask for phone number and name the hostess who has seen me and knows me to see me well I paid for my order cash put wallet on counter I took order but hostess notice my wallet full of cash sitting on counter, picked up and put behind counter it was gone thru.and money stolen.,by a DENUNZIOS EMPLOYEE. IVE GONE CRAZY LOOKING FOR WALLET...HOSTESS SAW MY WALLET PICKED IT UP PUT BEHIND COUNTER, PROPRTY OF DENUNZIOS HAD PHONE # on takeout order and light to get out of parking lot probably 4 times before light changes so I was still in lot . The hostess if she had a pea for a brain would of called,my Wallet was in plan site and phone  # plainer site. So look for Monroeville police to be investigating............... PLEASE BOYCOTT THIS PLACE THEY HAVE CROOKS WORKING FOR THEM MABE THE HOSTRESS. SHE GAVE ZERO FUCKS ABOUT COULDNT GET AWAY FROM ME FAST ENOUGH. I WORKED AT A HOTEL 18 years you touched it last your reasonable if money comes up missing. The owner does not have the balls to even call to see what happened.Had some parties we were gonna book 3- 50 year old surprise party June, July. December. Not no more, not from a bunch of lying cash stealing, cowards, 500.00$ was all I had to my name you Crooks/ make that in no time....sorry I'm all over the place but I'm fucking irate.I hope the police see something on survalance"}
{"text":"My family visited the restaurant to celebrate my Mother's 88 birthday.  The only positive experience was that we had made reservations and were seated promptly.  The waiter had no interest with our table and was unpleasant.  He did not even acknowledge some of my family at our table.  Not even taking drink orders unless we stopped him when passing our table.    We were at the restaurant for 2 hours and 40 minutes.  Waiting for our main course for well over an hour.  We had family visiting from out of town and it was a miserable experience.  When we finally did receive our dinner, 8 out of our party of 10 were dissatisfied with their meal.    We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I've only ever been here for large, work-related, holiday parties (our department is about 15 people).  We tend to get the same waiter every visit, and he's very pleasant and helpful.  Never seems over-stressed.  I've actually had some nice conversations with him.  Typical of Pittsburgh Italian restaurants (IMHO), the portion sizes are enormous.  Yes, wonderful on one front, but also saddens me on another.  Being my nerdy, accountant self, and having watched way too much Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares, Denunzio's is throwing away money via inventory through giving out too much food.  However, they remain a pretty popular place, so I can't imagine this is harming their bottom line much.  The desserts are supreme!  I also really like the appetizers.  This is a good place to take family in from out of town, or get some good, homemade Italian comfort food.  I believe they have a spaghetti night that's reasonably priced too.  Oh, final note, enough selections to make a vegetarian satisfied.  :)"}
{"text":"Terrible food, terrible rude staff. Avoid this place and save money. The people that like this place have no idea what Italian food should taste like."}
{"text":"I joined my friend and her family at Denunzio's to celebrate her nursing graduation. We ordered many appetizers, including the bruschetta, fried zucchini, mozzarella sticks and fried calamari. I really enjoyed the bruschetta! For dinner, I, along with three other people in our party, had the crab ravioli. It was so delicious and we all thought that! It was on their specials menu. I do not know if I'd go back any time soon because the location is not close to me, but I would vouch that it was a great restaurant to go to!"}
{"text":"\"OMG TERRIBLE!!!!!!\" My wife's family and I go to this place every time I come to Pittsburgh to see them (Mother and Father in laws favorite Italian Restaurant). I've been there three times before and have always thought the food was good but everybody else LOVED it. On July 8th 2017 we came to the restaurant for dinner (party of 6) and EVERYTHING was terrible. Starting with appetizers (mussels, fried calamari, and Caprese salad). Mussels were over done, calamari was all dried out and over done, and the Caprese salad was chinsey. My brother in law and his son had for entrees the eggplant ravioli (TERRIBLE). I tasted it and it was tasteless. My veal parm dinner for $21 had one piece of veal that was slightly tough but the pasta was mushy and cold and the veggies were also cold.My father in law thought his chicken parm was OK but his pasta and veggies were cold and mushy as well. My moyher in laws eggplant dinner was to her liking. My wife's shrimp dish need doctoring up with some spice because it was very bland. The best part of my meal was the chicken pot pie soup. For a $200 meal I was unpleasantly surprised since in the past everybody LOVED this place. I don't know if a cook left or was off but something went very wrong in the kitchen that night. We won't be back."}
{"text":"6/17/2015 We had dinner reservations for 18 people in our group.  They only had one waitress serving us and she seemed like she had a chip on her shoulder.  Someone should tell her that a smile goes a long way and when someone says \"thank you\" it won't kill you to say \"you're welcome.\"  As for the food, well the bread in all of the baskets was cold. But the wedding soup, and main entrees were good."}
{"text":"Pizza Pizza.  That's all I can say about this place.  Their meals are ok.  Some items are pretty good, others are just ok.  We tend to get pizza when we go though, which is hard to beat around here.  My wife's parents who are italian won't get pizza anywhere but an italian place thats still run by italians.  Every time they come into town, they stop and get us pizza at least once, but usually twice from here.  Don't just stop at the pepperoni either, they have a bunch of good pies.  They have one with shrimp that's really good.  They had one that was almost like a salad that was equally as good.  I'm not sure the names of all these pies, I usually just get them brought to my house to enjoy."}
{"text":"Terrible service tonight by a drill sergeant of a server. Our food was barely warm when it was served and our table was not prebused.    The server took over 20 minutes to bring our check and then another 15 to pick them up.     We will not be back."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant has nice Italian cuisine.  The muscles are outstanding however I did not get a picture of them because I ate them so fast that I forgot to take a picture.  The linguine with white clam sauce is fantastic I highly recommend it.   Nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"I've been to DeNunzio's a couple of times.  There is a reason that it is one of the few places that you can make last minute reservations on Mother's Day.  I had the spaghetti and meatball and the lasagna.  Quite simply...it was not good. The place does have good service...I will give them that."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Italian Food!  From appetizers to Dessert!!"}
{"text":"The food was great. Everything was delicious. My three stars are solely because of mediocre service. Our waiter was very short with us...not necessarily rude but just seemed like he'd rather be elsewhere. My daughter waited 15 minutes for a refill on her drink. The other two didn't even get refills. The waiter barely even stopped at our table when he checked on us. Rather, he'd walk by and as he was passing would talk over his shoulder to us, \"how's everything?\"...didn't even wait for an answer. It's a shame because despite the variety on the menu and great tasting food, I doubt we'll be back. A plain pizza and 3 orders of spaghetti shouldnt result in a 90 minute visit."}
{"text":"My friend suggested that we eat here before going to a show. My husband and I live in the north hills, so we've never heard of Denunzio's. We were pleasantly surprised...the food was excellent! We would definitely return here for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Should be 3.5 stars  Had good lunch at DeNunzio's. Simple decor of Italian family restaurant, good amount of space between the tables.  Very good Italian wedding soup, and then salmon caesar salad, fresh and nice, good portion size.  Prompt service."}
{"text":"As a former server, I am shocked by the horrible service we received while eating dinner at Denunzios last weekend. Our server, Ted, was the most unfriendly and unaccommodating server I have ever had the misfortune of meeting. We waited hours (not exaggerating) for our main course. When he asked what appetizers we wanted to order he said something along the lines of \"I am only taking your orders for appetizers not for main courses to make it easier on me so I can take care of the other tables.\"  He couldn't even be bothered to crack a smile once or stop by the table to check on us. I will not return to this establishment again."}
{"text":"I travel extensively and dine out often.  I'm a firm believer in supporting local businesses.    This is very ordinary Italian food.  Famous chopped salad?  Please.  They throw some walnuts on top of lettuce.  Food is overpriced for what you get. Waitress seemed like she wanted to move us along.  What for?  It wasn't that busy."}
{"text":"Awesome food. We have been here on more than one occasion and never really are disappointed. I do wish the bread was warm when they bring it out, though. We got the calamari (paired with the BEST marinara sauce I have ever eaten. Really, I could eat it by the spoonful) and scallops with prosciutto for apps. Absolutely amazing. He got veal and said it was a little dry (I did not try). I got the mushroom ravioli.   Our server was good and recommended wine that I should try when I asked her. I've never been blown away by the service there, but in all our visits, can't say I was ever neglected either. They are usually pretty busy when we stop (either Friday or Saturday nights) so sometimes they are just absentminded, but on this particular night we had a good experience.  The only thing I really didn't like was it looked like my ravioli were frozen and then just heated with sauce on top. I hope this wasn't the case. Nonetheless, everything was delicious, timely, and very satisfying!"}
{"text":"This place comes \"out of the blocks\" strong, with incredibly delicious, fresh bread and really peaks there.  The rest of the meal is solid...just the bread sets the bar high enough the meal can't quite reach.   While the portions are more than reasonable, the food was noticeably salty and just...typical Italian fare. It's not bad, just not \"over the top\" either.  The service was decent, but again - nothing to rave about.    Adequate might be the word for this place.  I left well-fed, so the place served it's purpose - but there was just something missing.  I guess I'd go back, but this isn't a rotation-type place in my opinion."}
{"text":"I was very curious to check out a Monroeville standby, but I was not at all impressed by my meal.  The wedding soup, for example was not even average.  Oddly enough, the Crème Brûlée was pretty good.  The food is very much Italian American, not the exquisite Italian cuisine that I love.  The prices are fairly high for what you are getting, quality wise, however the portions are good.  This place is just not my first choice."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for a work meeting, and was overall happy with my visit. The service was great and the food was pretty good. The decor is also really cute here- they had the entire place decorated for fall. I wouldn't say this is authentic Italian- it felt more like Americanized Italian, but the meal I had was still pretty tasty. I ordered the romano-crusted chicken salad. The chicken was really tasty, and the salad was quite fresh. The creamy parm dressing was delicious as well. The prices here are a bit steep, but overall we had a really great meal. I would come back for another business lunch meeting, although I don't know if it's worth driving here from the South Hills for dinner."}
{"text":"We loved our visit to Denunzios! Our waitress was extremely nice and attentive. The portions we received were perfect and delicious! The fresh baked bread and creme brûlée were my favorite dishes of our meal, but everything was good!"}
{"text":"The wedding soup was disappointing (apparently, it used to be really good when Bryan worked out that way), but the lobster ravioli was very good and so was the fresh bread. If we're out that way again, we'd probably try another restaurant I've never been to instead of going there again, but it was okay. Not great for the price, but good enough."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere inside. I saw that they had a wine bar which was a great touch. Their sausage could use a little more seasoning but everything was good. I highly recommend that everyone try the desert."}
{"text":"We waited a long time for out appetizer soups and entrees! My husbands food was hot and my meal was cold . I asked the waiter to reheat which he did and it came back still cold ! The waiter had no interest in our visit you could tell. Overall food was very good  but the service was slow and my food was cold !"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food, decor and service but found the prices to be a bit high for a strip mall casual setting feel.  The portions are huge and meals do include either a soup or salad, so keep that in mind if you are thinking of ordering appetizers.  We ordered the roasted red pepper bruschetta.  It had a good flavor, but I don't think it was cooked long enough as there was plenty of cheese that was not fuly melted.  We both tried combinations.  I had the three chicken choice and my husband the three pasta.  I found that there wasn't that great a discernable difference between the taste of the chickens.  I think that may be because their sauce ran into each other on the place.  They were tasty and the portions large.  They were served with green beans.    I finished my meal off with a serving of limoncello which was very tasty, but I found the $6 price tag to be a bit steep.  Overall, I enjoyed the dining experience but I can't see returning on any regular basis."}
{"text":"We had a celebration of our dad's life last night. The staff was so accommodating. They made sure everything was set up perfectly. The food was wonderful. I would highly recommend DeNunzio's!"}
{"text":"While at Starbucks (am I that predictable?), I decided to ask some of the locals where they would go to eat.  They gave me two choices and, after Yelping, I chose Denunzio's Italian Trattoria.  You know, I am coming to understand why so many people like chain restaurants -- they are consistently average.  I can handle that.  This was not average.  Having been to MANY Italian/Sicilian style restaurants, I think that I have a lot more to compare with.  On our menu tonight:  Meatballs with Red Sauce Provolone sticks with Red Sauce Chicken Piccata (they spell Picata) with Italian Wedding Soup and Angel Hair Pasta with Marinara Sauce Veal Parmesan (light sauce) with Italian Wedding Soup and Baked Rotini (light sauce) Coke Tea  If you live in the area and this is the place you love and you aren't going to visit anywhere else, please don't read on.  I don't want to shatter your fragile reality.  If you are willing to come out of the dark though, please read on.  This review will be slightly different than the norm due to the overall poor quality of the meal.  All that comes to my mind is, \"Wow!\"  How can they serve this food and people enjoy it?    Open a can and voilà you have your food!  No, really.  The red sauce was just tomato sauce straight from the can with little smatterings of seasonings.  The marinara sauce was stewed tomatoes from the can with a little of the tomato sauce added.  I am not opposed to he flavors, mind you, but I can go to Sam's and purchase a great big can of each of these \"sauces\" for quite a bit less.  Why would I pay a restaurant to do it for me?  Speaking of Sam's, those provolone sticks are directly from their freezer.  Not only were they purchased at Sam's, but they weren't even properly cooked.  UGH!  The bread was okay, but wasn't baked at the restaurant.  I tried some of the olive oil on the table and wished that I hadn't.  I don't think that the oil had been changed for several years.  PLEASE change the olive oil, it can and WILL go bad.  What is currently on the table has gone beyond rancid.    I must say that the best part of the meal was the Italian Wedding Soup.  This is due to the fact that it had little to no flavor rather than bad flavor.  Even a little salt would have helped the soup some.  Everyone should take note, I NEVER add salt to anything.  RANT RANT RANT  And then the entrees.  I know that I am critical, but my friend is usually easier to please.  Looking at his face after his first bite of the Veal Parmesan, I asked him how he liked it.  His comment, \"Yes, I too have been spoiled.\"  The grimace did not leave his face; he thought it was ketchup that had been used on the Veal.  I tried some and it was tough.  My Chicken Piccata was not much better.  The cooks in the back didn't understand what they were doing.  The sauce was both overcooked and undercooked at the same time.  It was like a sludge (over-cooked) on the plate due to it being over-reduced, possibly it was a thickener?  Then there was the wine flavor, that flavor you get when you don't cook out the alcohol (under-cooked).  The chicken was tough like the veal.    The only bright part during the entire meal was the server.  She was always on top of things and always chipper.  I didn't have the heart to tell her how bad it was.  And the $30 per person price tag just put the nail in the coffin for me.  I did see that they served Sandwiches and Pizza.  Maybe these are good?  I don't know.  I do know that I don't want to return."}
{"text":"We almost went to a different Italian restaurant afterward as redemption. His steak was flavorless and chewy and marinara like acid with a putrid aftertaste. My Alfredo seemed more like a soup than a pasta dish. Overpriced! Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is filthy and disgusting. My wife and I went and were treated to a fly in the oil and vinegar. The table was dirty. We had a hair in our salad. By the time the entrees came we had lost our appetite.  You couldn't pay me to go back. The management tried by giving us a gift certificate to return.  No one in their right might would go back to that cesspool"}
{"text":"The Denunzio's lived in my neighborhood when I was a kid, and we went to their restaurant a few times.  I could not get enough of their spaghetti.  This time, I went to a big gathering at their Monroeville location.  Huge metal trays of chicken parmesan and chicken picata, huge piles of green beans and vegetables, penne pasta in red sauce, garden salad with vinagrette dressing, and super-fresh bread.  I had seconds, then thirds, and even fourths...and that was before they brought out the desserts.  The whole place was relaxed and friendly, and waiters brought out fresh drinks every opportunity they could.  There was no spaghetti at the party that night, but Denunzio's still serves up good, wholesome, stick-to-your ribs food, perfect for a party or a family dinner.  I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went to the Monroeville location with the hubs for a late lunch because he brought home leftover chicken dish with pasta one day and promised he'd take me to where it came from.  I didn't order the chicken tho.  I ordered a pasta dish that came out a little on the 'watery' side instead of saucy.  Hubs ordered a much better dish that came out saucy instead of 'watery.'  So we took his leftovers home.  Service is good.  The decor could be a little brighter and not so green and burgundy."}
{"text":"I visited DeNunzio's for take out at the recommendation of the hotel staff... I guess that the best way to describe it is 'not horrible.'  First, the young man who took my order was excellent. Very good natured and helpful. A great first impression. Also, my order was ready very quickly and they made sure that I had everything that I needed.  The side salad was very fresh and larger than I expected. The house Italian dressing was excellent!  The short comings all revolve around the pasta... Not a good thing for an Italian restaurant. I went basic with spaghetti and meatballs. The spaghetti was a little overcooked for my taste. Kind of mushy. The smooth sauce was bland and watery and there wasn't enough to cover the pasta. I'm indifferent about the meatballs. Reasonable size and texture but no distinctive flavor. Overall it reminded me of my old high school cafeteria.  So, the overall experience was okay. If you're at a nearby hotel and looking for quick takeout it's better than a chain restaurant and reasonably priced. If you're looking for great Italian, this wasn't it."}
{"text":"Always great.  The Ronnie is my fav... 3 variations of chicken, with small pasta, veggies & soup/salad.  Will definitely come again"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get delicious Italian food. The food reminds me of my Italian grandmother's home cooking when I was growing up. The atmosphere is casual and cozy. The staff has always been friendly. My husband loves the lobster ravioli. I love the  tomato cream sauce and always ask for it on my cheese ravioli. Portions are pretty big too. The wedding soup is average. Overall prices are reasonable.   This is also a nice place to have big parties. I recently planned a friend's wedding shower for here. The prices for something like this are very competitive.  I will keep coming here!"}
{"text":"This was my first and last experience at Denunzio's in Monroeville. I went there for dinner with a neighbor friend of mine. Our experience started off on the wrong foot by asking the waitress questions about the menu and about portion sizes. I first started off ordering water with lemon however I never got the lemon until mentioned a 3rd time about it. She was not very happy that I asked again. She proceeded to bring me a carafe with about7 lemon wedges just to be spiteful. My friend asked twice for extra tomatoes on his salad before he finally received them. The waitress named Dianna was so rude that we felt like getting up and walking out. She proceeded to say that since we were 2 guys she figured she would have an easy time serving us only to to tell us we are killing her. As if we had no right to ask about menu items. Every time she passed our table she made it a point to mention I got my lemons. I proceeded to explain everything to the manager after we paid our tab. He said I hope her tip reflected the service and I said it sure did 0.00. I am attaching a pic of the water carafe with l  UPDATE ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  How dare you accuse us of walking off without paying our bill Dianne and lie that you went and paid our tab out off your pocket. That is absolute bullshit and now you made this review look even worse by lying and accusing us of not paying. We discussed it with the Matre D and the Manager. The manager wanted to comp us the meals after explaining the situation however we told him it wasn't necessary because we paid already. THERE IS NO WAY I AM NOW REMOVING THIS REVIEW. YOU DESERVED EVERY WORD of this review"}
{"text":"Second time here.  Can't imagine there'll be a third.  Enuff is enuff when there are so many other good options around.  Pros:   Close to the abode. Fast and friendly service.  Cons: Food presentation.  Red sauce reminiscent of Chef Boyardee slathered over a combo platter of gnocchi, ravioli, meatball, and spaghetti is not necessarily an award winning nor eye-appealing piece of art.  Bland taste.  The dish seemed to be steaming.  Then I realized it was just the meatball that was hot.  All else was lukewarm.  And bland.  Did I already say bland?  I meant bland.  Impression:  Reminds me of bad school cafeteria fare.  Geez, maybe even a sprig of parsley would have spruced it up.  Nah..."}
{"text":"Copper River salmon was good but not great--I had the lemon with crab meat which was a little dry---needed more sauce.  last week I had the regular salmon at Arnold Palmer Airport Denunzios and it was actually better than this Alaskan Salmon! Also was mislead re the \"happy hour\" advertising of \"half-off\" on drinks.  Turns out only applies to drinks purchased in bar area!  Should not put circular with that info on the dining room tables if it only applies tombarvarea!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is attractive and comfortable, but rather noisy if one is seated adjacent to other parties.  The food was outstanding: white pizza with mushrooms and fried zucchini, both among the best in the region. Prices are fair. Service was satisfactory, but slow.  The zucchini took 15 minutes to be delivered, too long at lunch.  Thankfully, my friend and I had plenty of time.  There was a lengthy wait for the entrees as well, delivered well after we were finished with the zucchini.  If one has an hour to spend for lunch, they will use it if dining here.  I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! We have tried their other locations but the food just isn't as good. We will continue to be regulars here!"}
{"text":"The waiters were nice and helpful. The food was good and the complimentary bread was great. I like that the pasta dishes come with a soup and it was a decent size. The prices were average for this type of sit-down Italian restaurant and i would definitely stop by again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Service was great! But my experience was ruined by the fact that they did not have sweetened iced tea. Also I was baffled by the fact that the bread I was given was fairly cold to my liking, which made it very difficult to spread my butter. Typically at a fine restaurant like this, my bread is fairly warm which is how I like it."}
{"text":"Easter Buffet Review 2018  Breakfast Buffet - 1 Star Terrible set up so lines are long and wait times for omelette and egg station 5 minutes as they have one cook  Frozen Sams club sausage patties re-heated Cold scrambled eggs Eggs Benedict on top of cold, un-toasted English muffins  Sausage gravy the consistency of water   Salad Bar - 2.5 Star  Small selection of standard fair -  Rolled pcs of smoked salmon  30-31 count tail on shrimp with cocktail sauce Sliced tuna pcs Small plate of Greek olives and 3 cheeses Once again, all items appear to come from either a bag, a jar or defrosted from frozen - nothing special   Main Food Bar - 2.75 Star  Probably the best as this has the pasta, meat and potatoes and those are the only items here that appear made to be made from scratch as expected from an Italian restaurant.      Overall - At $30 per person I can't give this anything higher than the 2 stars as there really isn't good value in paying that amount for basically frozen and packaged foods set out on platters."}
{"text":"I find it a bit hard to find outstanding Italian in Pittsburgh, but what I like about this place is that it is decent, clean, and has pretty good service and value. It definitely has a family restaurant atmosphere, so if you are looking for top notch Italian....do not come here. If you are looking for above average, family restaurant, decent value food, this is great place. I believe that all of their pastas are homemade/fresh, and that alone is pretty rare. We had one of their ravioli's, and I had their strozzapretti de nunzios, which was very good. nice tomato flavor, rich, good spice, and a bit sweet. The caesar salad was subpar, however, with too much of a commercial salad dressing taste."}
