{"text":"Hey very friendly people there very helpful if your not terribly familiar with middle eastern food.  I had a Jordanian special of the day.  It was a lamb shank braided in yogurt.  Excellent !"}
{"text":"I attempted to try the buffet but was very disappointed by the types of items being served. The name of the place is 'Bread and Kabob'; but I found neither bread nor any kabob in the buffet. As a matter of fact, they were serving Southern Fried Chicken, Meatball/Noodles, and Rice. Very strange!"}
{"text":"Some of the best middle eastern food I've ever had. You know you're not getting an American interpretation of traditional dishes, you're getting the real thing. 
The staff is so accommodating and kind. If I lived closer I would definitely dine here regularly. Generous portions that lasted for lunch the next day!
And, the best hummus I've ever had.
Ideal taste and texture. You have to get some!"}
{"text":"I ended up eating a chicken shawarma dish with hummus that was good.  The chicken was pretty lazily butchered though, lots of connective tissue.  Garlic whip is good.  The service is pretty awful here but the food is pretty good for the price."}
{"text":"Halal status??? After I ordered my take out, I went to check out their freezer section. The frozen section had stuff they use in their restaurant, I could tell because the boxes were open. They had halal chicken patties. The cheesesteak slices are from a company called original Philly cheesesteak co, I tried to see if these guys had halal products, did not find. Now this makes me doubt their halal status that they have posted outside. If the admin can clarify, I would be happy to take this down. Until then, if you're looking for halal food, beware of this place being misleading. You don't have to take my word for it, go in and see for yourself."}
{"text":"First visit... Great food!!!!!

I must admit I was a little confused. From the outside it looks like a grocery store. But when I walked in I was greeted by a man at the front desk. He quickly grabbed a menu for me and answered all of my questions. The food is made fresh and did not take long. The food was outstanding. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We initially really liked this hole-in-the-wall place, and tolerated the horrible service when we dined in because of the excellent food.  However, on our repeat visits the quality of the food has been very inconsistent.  Sometimes they put tzatziki sauce on the gyros and sometimes they don't, etc.

It's not the worst place to get take-out food if you are in the area, but I wouldn't make a special trip.  I recommend checking your food before you drive off to make sure there hasn't been a major screw-up."}
{"text":"This review isnt about the food because 2 hrs after an order I am still waiting. I ordered through foodiecall.  They have called me several times with an update stating the restaurant is behind. The driver called from the restaurant waiting, as well."}
{"text":"First off, the food is very delicious and I will definitely be dining there again. They have the best hummus I've had in a LONG time.

Our meal started out with fresh tortilla chips and salsa. (I thought that was weird for the type of restaurant) We saw the waitress pour it right out of the bottle into a bowl and serve it to us. 

We ordered the hummus appetizer for $4.89 or something like that. I was under the impression that we'd get the hummus plate that was pictured on Yelp. Nope, we got a tiny bowl of hummus. So very disappointing for the price we paid. It was delicious but expensive/small. Maybe our waitress made a mistake but we still got charged the $4.89.

I also ordered the chicken shawarma. It was spectacular.

The customer service was not great. Our waitress acted like she didn't want to be there. My husband had to ask for a refill and a box multiple times. We were the only customers there around 1pm.  So the customer service is the reason that I only gave it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Burnt! Burnt lamb! Is that a thing now?

Hell no it isn't!!!! And never will be. 

The guy who owns this place has the attitude of a fish. Yes fish have no attitudes at all. TA DAH you got it! He just stood there, muttering out short answers for everything I asked. And I'm thinking, dude this place looks like a hell hole that use to be a cafeteria for Satan, that's now a hell hole again. I don't know what's worse. 

I thought the food would be great because the place was so sh#tty! A dive joint? A neighborhood restaurant? But nooooooo!!! The lamb was burnt through and through. The rice had absolutely no flavor. The salad was tasteless and the lettuce was wilted. Oh and in case I failed to mention, the lamb was BURNT!!! Crispy! Charcoal! Fingers black! Soot! Tarred! Tasteless, chewy, dog-gnawing, TWD flesh-chewing, burnt garbage!

If only I didn't take it to go."}
{"text":"Food is so yummy! Service is pretty good! The music selection is random. They were playing Latin music, not what I expected from a middle eastern restaurant!"}
{"text":"First time buying from this place and the food was not great at all. The rice and shrimp was dry and tasteless and the pita bread was so dry it was hard..  

The only good thing was the mango juice. That was rich in flavor and I loved it.. 

Would not recommend this place.."}
{"text":"We stopped by this place for lunch. They have a lunch buffet which starts at 11 am, but we didn't find falafel or the other dishes that we wanted to try, so we chose to go ala-carte. In the beverages, we tried the yogurt drink and turkish coffee. The yogurt drink was very delicious - it tasted like the masala buttermilk that you get in India. The turkish coffee has a nice flavor to it and one sip of that got me addicted. For the appetizer, we had the veggie samosa - again a great dish. It was served with the Tzatiki sauce (which is a cucumber and yogurt sauce) which was great, nevertheless the samosa's by itself has a lot of flavor to it and was yummy. We also tried the lentil soup which was tasty. For the main course, we tried the veggie platter - it comes with pita breads, baba ganoush, hummus, salad, falafel, french fries and onions & jalape√±os. This was indeed a lot - all the dishes were great. You can have them replace the salad with hummus, if you'd like to. We also tried the falafel wrap which was good too. Finally, the goodness ended on a sweet note with kanafa- this is a very sweet semolina and cheese based dish which I happen to eat for the first time - usually I only see baklava as a dessert option in mediterranean restaurants here, but kanafa was a surprise and we enjoyed it thoroughly. You need to let them know 30 mins in advance as this dish takes time to prepare. Do try this place - its great!!"}
{"text":"A little slice of Greek heaven!!  The gyros was amazing.  Looking forward to the next order.  Thank you Moe!  I won't forget your tip :)"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place out for awhile, so I stopped by yesterday and thought I'd try it out. The restaurant/deli was very clean which is a plus. I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap, fries and falafel pieces. The wrap was really good. The fries were a little over seasoned but still good. The falafel was pretty good but not the best. Overall my experience was pleasant and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This restaurant caught me by surprise. On the outside it's a simple little spot, nothing special. Upon entry the teeny grocery market catches the eye, filled with halal goods with labels marking many of the goods as imports. Strolling past the kitchen, I inquired about ordering. One of the two obvious workers directed me to a checkout counter where I ordered and paid.  My beverage I grabbed from the cooler. Moments after having a seat, I was greeted by a simple which was followed by hummus. Nicely done. Then, the garlic chicken served over aromatic rice with garlicky sour cream sauce.  Ummmm. Good!!' I can't wait to bring friends to this place."}
{"text":"Another visit! 

Amazing food. Let me say it again in case you did not hear me....amazing food. 

I uploaded some pictures so enjoy. 

Baked fish---the best fish I have had in a very long time. Very fresh and delicious. I was in heaven. Rice is very well seasoned.  Delicious. 

Falafel---very fresh and good. I thin the cook makes everything here from stretch. In fact I saw the cook was making falafel. Yes I sure did. 

Grape leaves with seasoned rice stuffing--- again so fresh and delicious. 

Let's move on to the sauces--- humus(very good), egg plant sauce (very strong chargrilled flavor...amazing), garlic sauce ( it looks like just plain yogurt and it will blow your mind away when you taste it.  It goes perfectly with the back fish... Oh my god)

The only down side of this place is... Since there is usually one cook and maybe one other guy in the kitchen... It takes a little while to get your food but if you are in a hurry I recommend you call ahead. The baked fish takes about 35-40 min. The wait was totally worthy it for me though.

Very nice people here. Please give this place a try."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place. When they first opened, awesome establishment, and now it's just falling off. I ordered delivery at 12:36 PM, it's now 2:43 PM. They called me at 1:26 PM to tell me they didn't have a sauce for my wings, and that the driver was leaving in 5 minutes. Its now 2:43 PM and the establishment is 8 minutes from my house. Why lie, and say someone was on the way? Ended up cancelling my order, because the guy asked me to give them another 10 minutes for my order. Sad thing is, I'm a chef, and know a lot of folks out here. The gentleman had an attitude on the phone, and wasn't the nicest person for someone who was in the wrong. I do this restaurant business. I don't care if you're working at McDonald's, you provide an honest service, and you do it with pride. That's the last time they will get my business. Cheers"}
{"text":"La Shish is well known as the best Middle East restaurant  in the grand Charlotte area. But this one is almost as good as it.
I ordered the lamb kabob plate to go. The lamb are cooked very well. Fully cooked but still very juicy, and have a beautiful taste.
The rice here beat the rice of La Shish. You may feel strange at first because they use a microwave oven to heat the rice. But as I have proved, it really tastes good. It is a little but just right spicy, little juicy, not dry at all. 
Pita is soft and above average.
Vegetables, who care.
CHILLY POTATO as my side. Really special and taste good!

The only thing you want to pay attention. They cook as you ordered. So you would expect a 15 minutes wait. But the food is worthy for your time."}
{"text":"It's a simple restaurant that co-exists along a Mediterranean grocery store! Very gracious hosts and excellent food! Definitely try out their Kanafa(dessert) and Turkish coffee!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you, this food is unbelievable! Everything was fresh and flavorful, from the beef kabobs with rice to the baba ganoush with warm flat bread. Humus was a perfect texture and we ordered extra along with bread to take home to enjoy later. Both times we have come we were treated like special guests. The waiter is always engaging and friendly and is more than happy to talk about the food, soccer, etc."}
{"text":"The food is not at all good. It's just the cheap, but if really care a bit about quality this place is completely wrong.

Worst thing is there no service if you want to dine in. Owner was working himself during the Friday busy lunch time with no help.

Avoid and save your money"}
{"text":"Ordered a spicy chicken add cheese with fries. The guy that rang up my order was on a personal call while taking my order. I always check my food before I leave an establishment. They left off the cheese and when I told the guy that rang me up he said \"that sandwich doesn't come with cheese\" in which I replied \" right that's why I asked for cheese on it\". Then he says \"that'll be 50 cent.\" I was not about to pay when it should've never been left off to begin with. Had he not been on the phone while taking my order, maybe he could have gotten it right. Its unprofessional to be on a personal call while trying to assist a customer."}
{"text":"I've been here MANY MANY times before and today was by far the worst experience they chef seemed like he did not want to cook today. I ordered the chicken philly and requested that he pay attention to the amount of  fries he puts on the plate because I was shorted last time the chef proceeded to snappily respond so that's an extra side (never asked for extra, just wanted what I paid for) then went back and forth about the portion ect ect finally I said as long as I'm getting what I paid for we should be fine, I don't know if he took that as an opportunity to try to give horrible service but normally the food takes awhile to come out because everything is fresh my food came out extremely quickly from what i normally wait for the bread of the philly wasn't toasted and he gave me old fries that had been sitting there because they came to the table cold. I sent them back and they gave me fresh fries which took much longer than the first wait I had. Rethinking coming back......"}
{"text":"Cool little market and cafe that we hit on our visit to Concord. Authentic middle eastern food with fabulous kabobs. Our server was very inviting and helpful with our ordering (we had some guests that had not eaten Middle Eastern food before). We will definitely be back if we visit the area again."}
{"text":"So the portions were big which is a plus. The hummus was runny and not very good, I really love hummus in general. Their Greek salad lettuce was not dried right so at the bottom of the cantor was lot of water. The only thing that was good was there chicken. And that only a couple of pieces that rest was burnt. I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Food is great, I get food here when i do not feel like cooking at home.
It is Greek Mediterranean cuisine so basically rice, kebabs and greek salads etc.
Service is slow or non existent on some days, so I call, make a to go order and pick it up after 20 minutes. 
If you are looking for ambience and good customer service, go elsewhere.
Food is very fairly priced for the quality."}
{"text":"Pretty good, more of a takeout place than a sit in. Great price for shwarmas. Lacked professional customer service and appearance."}
{"text":"It was ok. If you want to grab a quick bite, it is good. I would not go again for Mediterranean food, if I have a better option near by. The food taste was good. But the pita was not warm. The host was super nice !"}
{"text":"What a great find! The food was absolutely delicious and filling. You get a really good value for your dollar. I ate entirely too much. The double wrap order isn't actually double meat in one wrap (which I assumed like a fool). It's literally two wraps plus French Fries. I can't wait to come back with friends!"}
{"text":"The lamb was very, very good. Nicely tender and cooked. The humus was pretty good, but I've tried better ones. Salad was average. Prices are pretty cheap and they give discount to students, which is a plus. The inside was like a cafeteria at a school which didn't bother me but I was a little surprised it was also connected with a mini grocery store. Their service wasn't too great since my girlfriend and I had to wait nearly 10 minutes just for some water, which taste unpleasantly. So I highly suggest you not to order water because it tasted like tap/sink water. If it wasn't for the lamb, this place would have gotten a 3 stars or lower."}
{"text":"This is a Middle Eastern restaurant located in a strip mall in the University area.  From the outside, it may be confusing as to what this place may be- which is why it took us awhile to go here- even though we love this type of food.

Parking is plentiful, and on our visits it was never very crowded.  There's usually a Groupon available too if you're lucky.  We frequent another Middle Eastern restaurant in the area- so that is what I compare this restaurant to.

When you walk in, straight ahead there is the counter to order at, and to the right is the seating area.  To the left is a grocery area, with Middle Eastern groceries.  You order at the counter, and then the food is brought out to you.  Employees do check on you to see how you are doing.

I preferred the \"other\" Middle Eastern restaurant in the area in comparison.  The rice flavor was not as good in my opinion, and neither was the chicken flavor.  The hummus was also not as great....but maybe I'm just used to the other!

Props to the owner- he was super friendly and did give us a free baklava for stopping in!  We may come back if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. 
Great food, good prices. We had hummus, chicken shawrma wrap, meat shawrma wrap, and a beef kabob wrap.  All wraps came with delicious fries. Everything was good."}
{"text":"Sought this restaurant out tonight based on ratings and photos.  The cashier took the orders but I believe was more in charge of the grocery side of the building.  He was friendly and helpful.  The chef knew more about the menu.  I ordered the gyro combo and broke the rules when I ordered a baklava.  The gyro lamb wasn't quite flavorless but not that typical/pungent flavor that most gyro places have my way (i.e. Greek Fiesta, Gyro City, Zorba's, mall types).  I was disappointed and I didn't noticed the taste of tzatziki sauce.  I'm glad  I didn't pay $1 to add feta. The fries were a bit salty. The baklava was good at first but was toooo sweet n syrupy.  More than I'm use to.  I probably should have made salad as planned.  If I return, I will try the coffee everyone is raving about and the falafel.  Hope not to be mislead.  The grocery side was clean and well laid out.  Plenty of places to sit for dining too."}
{"text":"Got food to go. Great price. Sweet tea wasn't really sweet (guess they haven't gotten the true meaning of southern sweet tea, lol). Very clean place. Will have to come back one day to actually eat in."}
{"text":"Great place. I'm not huge on this type food but myself and two brothers got the family platter and it was excellent."}
{"text":"Why on earth did I wait so long to visit this place?! I'm kicking myself and hope that you don't repeat my mistake. This place doesn't look like much, but it is a hidden gem! One side of a halal market is a restaurant serving delicious, lovingly prepared food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I enjoyed the daily special--a miniature roasted chicken stuffed with rice, golden raisins, and almonds. Fantastic and could easily be shared--I haven't been this excited about leftovers in quite some time. Tables are various sizes--one could sit up to 10 if needed, but the rest are 4-tops. My meal came with a simple salad tossed with a sharp, spiced vinaigrette--wish I had the recipe and I'm going to try and wrangle it out of the waiter shortly ;-) Price points are are reasonable for all meals, but this is not super cheap food and it shows. Don't walk--run in and be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Never had a problem here, great traditionally middle eastern homestyle cooking. Nice and quiet place to eat."}
{"text":"This is my Favorite place in town owner and staff are so friendly, food is always fresh. My favorite meal is mix grill meat on rice with lamb chicken and beef on skewers .  stars from me and my Family. Thanks a bunch"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Israel...  The food is delicious, the little market has the best chocolate bars ever, and the price is just perfect, I could not believe how affordable this was, and the serving sizes are huuge! Ok, I had the hummus to start (very fresh), and the beef kabobs, with the yummiest rice, salad AND fries? Yes please...  From friday to sunday they have \"kids eat free\", that was the cherry on top... So cool."}
{"text":"The friendly staff are hard to understand.  Miscommunication happens, but they do their best.  The ambiance is minimal - it is your typical inexpensive minimalist college divey type place.

The food is a four star affair.  I really like the menu, they even do a cheesesteak that isn't like Philly but infuses the Middle Eastern flavor flare into it.

Value/prices are all over the place.  Some things seem to be a great value and others more expensive.  I wish they give you a little more meat and toppings with the Gyro.  They don't say Heero by the way, they say jy roe."}
{"text":"Got the cheesesteak, it was huge. Definitely big enough for two. It was good, nothing special other than its size. Good French fries. Food came out hot and fast but the place was empty. The server forgot about me and it took forever to get a to-go box."}
{"text":"I am not above eating in a grocery store, though I would probably suggest you choose to do it in a grocery store that actually has a dining area - simply picking up a can and eating while walking down the aisle of your local Harris Teeter may not be the best idea.

In the case of Bread and Kabob, they are actually set up more as a restaurant (of sorts) than a grocery, with tables and everything. In actuality, it's a little odd. As you walk in, there is a center cash register area, which may be occupied by someone - if not they will likely be along soon - and this person either seats you, takes your to go order, answers the phone or rings up your grocery order. Put another way, they could quite possibly be rather busy if it's just a single person.

As luck would have it, Bread and Kabob isn't typically all that busy, so neither are they, so instead they walk around, play on their phone and that sort of thing. But they are nice, which helps.

If you are eating in (rather than taking your food to go), you will wait a while as the food is prepared. Nothing wrong with this, as fresh food can take a little while. When delivered, it's rather underwhelming. The rice is fragrant, but doesn't actually have much flavor. The beef kabob is plain. The shawarma is okay, but not great. All in all, I would be more likely to go for groceries than a meal."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken kabob comes with rice and my side was fries also comes with pita bread and garlic sauce. The chicken was juicy the fries were perfect and the rice with the garlic sauce was tasty. They prepare your food as soon as you order it was not a lengthy wait. Portion size to price was really good. I would recommend this restaurant to a friend!"}
{"text":"The shawarma was fantastic! I will definitely be coming back to try something else. Glad they opened a place like this close to Uncc.  Very convenient and affordable,  yet healthy"}
{"text":"The food had a wonderful taste. But everything was cold and soggy. That was due to delivery taking over an hour. We only live 5.3 miles from the restaurant. Not worth it."}
{"text":"The only thing I ever order here are lamb gyros, which I've had several times. They taste great, the service is quick, it's inexpensive, and the people are friendly. I've always ordered to go, but there is seating if you want to stay and relax. I love browsing through the store while my food is being prepped (which doesn't take long at all)."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Authentic taste.Will be there again ASAP. Missed the baklawa though because it was over by 8 pm on a sunday."}
{"text":"my wife and i decided to eat there last night for a dinner, its recently opened 3 weeks ago,,,,,, we went there around 6:30 Saturday evening,,,, the restaurant looked quiet, not too much customers.
we ordered 2 mix-grilled meat that came with beef and lamb kabob and chicken over besmati rice and served with salad, hummus bread......the food was great, and the service is awesome,....we also had lentil soup that was so good but was not warm enough."}
{"text":"Rude staff, extremely bad customer service. The restaurant environment is not the best. Some of the foods are good tho."}
{"text":"Great place to eat/order to go a quick shawarma. Its a family owned restaurant and the food clearly shows that. I like it!"}
{"text":"Be forewarned. 41 minutes and counting for a take out order of falafel and kabob plate.

UPDATE: I'd called my order in at 7:30. At 8:15 and after waiting patiently for a long time, I finally asked for a refund. The final straw was when a guy who came in after me got his food within 15 minutes or so."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken Schwarma Plate and it only came with chicken  and a Ton of rice.  The flavor was great but I felt for $10 there should be a salad and pita bread with it.  And I guess I should have asked for some Greek Sauce or Taziki or something... It was rather dry.  Will try again, but not anytime soon..."}
{"text":"It's not your typical food chain Mediterranean/Greek flavors. It's a small business ran with authentic falcons in mind. The Tzatziki sauce is original. 

We come here frequently and has learned the owner well so we usually get well portions of everything we order. Typically we order gyros. I tried the gyros salad, which was decent. I love the seasoning they use on their fries! We traditionally order a large plate full and share it. 

I'm not sure why the facility has had poor reviews before. The obvious reasons could be the interior layout/decor. Again, it's a small Mom/Pop type of business so it can be uncomfortable at first. Give it a shot before you knock. It's a great place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 4 stars due to their AMAZING BAKLAVA!!!! And they're super friendly. 

On the other hand I'd like to give 2-3 stars because I find it overpriced and the gyro was disgusting. The tzaiki sauce was so disappointing."}
