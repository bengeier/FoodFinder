{"text":"It's a great place to get a drink. On Fridays they have Open Mic so people can play their own music or what have you! 

They also have
Sami, Ice cream, Bagels, Muffins, Cookies, Teas and more."}
{"text":"Cozy little coffeeshop right in the heart of chester land, better than visiting Starbucks and lots of comfortable couches"}
{"text":"Excellent independent coffee shop! They put more espresso in their drinks than Starbucks....a must for coffee lovers.

Friendly with the absolute best breakfast sandwiches in the county!"}
{"text":"I grew up with Arabica as our little Chesterland coffee spot. As a young teen I didn't really realize how much of a future coffee addict I'd be or how popular coffee houses are. To us it was a local hangout and great spot to get a delicious and sweet drink. I visited them when I was back in town and while they've added more items to their menu it still just reminds me of home. I love the Nutty Irishman and their pastries always look so tempting! 

As I was doing my Yelp thing I ran into one of the owners and chatted with them a bit about Yelp and trying to eat like a local wherever we go using people's suggestions. I love that the owner took the time to talk with me and it proves the small town charm and hospitality is still a thing. 

Thanks for the great coffee!"}
{"text":"Pretty large-sized coffee place.  Love the drive-thru window.  They have just about every flavor or regular and sugar-free flavoring for beverages!  The young gentleman working the counter seemed a little unsure of himself and my iced latte order.  My drink ended up being more of an iced milk with a splash of espresso, so maybe he is learning the ropes.  Regardless, I love supporting small, local businesses, and I will continue to support this coffee place and give it another chance."}
{"text":"Let me start off saying this is the best coffee shop in northeast Ohio! Great coffee, smoothies and muffins. The staff is friendly and the owner is nice and respectful. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"First I will begin with a rant: 

I am seriously sick of paying $4 for a coffee and being patronized by mindless Starbuck parent basement dwellers who seem to think that keeping and not returning the .5 cent change is acceptable! 

Now, this place is everything opposite of Starbucks and thankfully so!  Excellent smooth tasting brewed coffee and sizes I understand! Them: good morning, how can I help you? Me: $2 for a large Pumpkin Spice with cream please.  \"Sure\".  Smile and have a nice day we both begin. No useless Starbucks small talk and a genuine smile!"}
{"text":"I did like this place and wanted to support a local business, but I don't like them pushing their hateful politics. No longer going to support them and encouraging others to do the same. There are better places to go to in the area."}
{"text":"Went to Arabica multiple times. Typically a great experience. Most recent visit I was rudely confronted by the owner for not placing my order fast enough after sitting down. Not exactly the coffee shop environment I would expect. Since they are remodeling, it was also difficult to find a table with an outlet because she was sitting at one of the only tables with an outlet the entire day. I plan to return, but if the owner is there again I'll likely look into other options."}
{"text":"Chesterland is full of charming home town businesses, and Arabica is one of them. It's not particularly chic, which matches the neighborhood, but where it lacks in style it picks up in other areas. 

There are tons of drink selections: coffees, espressos, teas, hot and cold. I always get a s'mores mocha, which a tasty fun drink for how sparingly I'm here. The prices are similar to Starbucks, so if you're looking for a bargain, this isn't it. 

The space is newly remodeled, and it works a lot better than the old configuration. There are plenty of tables and couches to hang out at or have some lunch. There's also a large group room with doors, so you can host meetings or study sessions. There is free WiFi throughout the space, but very few outlets-which is my only real complaint. 

Overall, I love coming here when I'm visiting my parents and need a change of scenery."}
{"text":"I love arabica! Always have! Their iced mochas are the best! This location always is quick and friendly. The cookies are huge and amazinggg! I love their muffins! A great little convenient spot in Chesterland!"}
{"text":"No water for you! I ordered two muffins, a coffee and a milk. I asked for a glass of water and was told \"No\". Only bottled water. You cannot get a cup of water?! NO. WHAT? The owner absolutely would not give me a glass of water."}
{"text":"Do NOT visit this business. The owner is unbelievably rude! She kicked my daughter who is nine months pregnant at the time, as well as myself out of the building. We did not  place our order quick enough in her opinion, and she kicked us out. She also did this to somebody else we knew last year. 

If you are looking for a relaxing place to visit with a friend, study, or just relax with a cup of coffee, this is not the place. Very stressful atmosphere, and very rude owner. I will take my business and my money elsewhere!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood coffee place to drive thru or meet clients for a Java. I personally recommend the huge muffins when warmed up - Mornng Glory is the best"}
{"text":"Excellent muffins. Their muffins are large, dense and tasty. The coffee is good. And the interior decor is comfy and cool with several different areas where you can talk to a friend or camp out by yourself and read the paper or a book."}
{"text":"Newly remodeled. Now has a small \"conference\" room. This coffee shop has the coffee drinks, tea and smoothies. Muffins, bagels, and pastries look so yummy. The seating is very comfortable. Take a book to relax or meet friends to chat. Has a convenient drive-thru window."}
