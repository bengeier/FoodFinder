{"text":"We order out at work every week and got their menu in the mail and gave them a try last week.  Pizza, hoagies, salads and pasta dishes were ordered with no evidence leftover shortly after delivery.  I had pepperoni pizza and it was delicious.  Thinner crust than other places and light on the sauce, how I prefer my pizza.  Coworkers who had other food items enjoyed their lunch too.  Looking forward to trying other menu items!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good. I went for pickup. I was more impressed with the staff. Everyone was super nice and very welcoming. A lot of times workers act like you are bothering them or that they are just miserable. They also had a nice dining area and it was clean. Only piece of advice to management is to move the extra supplies that were stacked by the front door to a non visible area to clean up the main area a bit."}
{"text":"Awful sauce, wings were okay, hoagies left alot to be desired. The pizza was cooked well but just thin crust, heavy tomato pastey sauce and no flavor. It's what a non-Italian place would think New York style pizza would be like, except there was like no cheese and the sauce was awful and too much of it. Hoagies just tasted like not fresh ingredients and meat. I wish there were zero stars for places like this."}
