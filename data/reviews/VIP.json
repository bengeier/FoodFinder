{"text":"Nice avocado sushi. Slightly overpriced but has authentic Chinese food and good service. Decent amount of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"When China Palace (Madison's East Side) closed and transformed into a Chinese-American buffet, I practically went into mourning. I have been looking for its replacement ever since. VIP shows promise of filling that hallowed spot in my heart (stomach?) with its extensive menu that includes many of my old favorites. I have been to VIP twice now to pick up take-out for lunch. The sushi I ordered (yes, they have a sushi and hibachi menu too!) was solid, though not fabulous. But the hand-pulled noodles were phenomenal, in a cravable, rich broth, with fresh cilantro and chili sauce (for chili heads only! You have to ask for it on the side). On my last visit, the manager sat and talked with me as I waited for my order. As it turns out, he is quite an accomplished food photographer: when I asked about the authentic Chinese dishes at VIP, he excitedly produced an iPad loaded with pictures of just about every item from the menu! He took me on a photographic tour of his favorite and most popular dishes--THE most enjoyable take-out experience I've ever had! I will be back for a sit-down dinner soon, and I know exactly what I will order."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and super good sushi, not to mention the Chinese food is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Based on the name, this is a place I would never expect to have good food, but the food pics on Yelp looked really good so we gave it a try. Had stir fry and sushi. Was really impressed with both."}
{"text":"I was wondering if the hand-pulled noodles are as good as every on Yelp claims they are. And they are. This place has fantastic hand-pulled noodles. You really can't go wrong. Whether you order the chicken- or beef-broth noodles, you'll have an enjoyable experience. I ordered the sushi as an appetizer and the cuts of fish were good, but not laudable. Definitely have to check this place out."}
{"text":"Solid food, great everytime. I really like the Salt and Pepper Shrimp.. I love to order pickup from here"}
{"text":"As far as Chinese food goes, you probably can't find better quality in Madison. They do a really good job preparing the food with care and even the presentation is appealing as far as Chinese food goes. The sushi is also very good. Fresh ingredients and good presentation. I was actually very impressed by their sushi since many Chinese food restaurants don't do a good job of making shushi. However, I have had to wait several times when going to pick up a multi-order meal when doing carryout. It should be mentioned that it happened right after they opened so they probably have things straightened out by now. As you can see from the photo I posted, the atmosphere is probably one of the nicest in the area. I would definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"the all you can eat option for sushi is a horrible experience. Three orders a time and need to wait for half a hour for another three orders.  The flavor is extremely terrible. Avoid at all cost"}
{"text":"First, I'm 100% aware that my review might be ignored by many since I'm a white American and this is a Chinese-Japanese restaurant... HOWEVER, although it's true that I can't speak to the authenticity of the food, I can speak to the flavors, freshness, and service.  I've been here MANY times (more than 10 by now) so am certainly overdue for a review. I love the food at VIP, and that's what keeps me coming back. I believe they (by choice) cater more toward the midwestern crowd, as this makes sense from a business standpoint; the wasabi is on the mild side, and there more specialty rolls than a la carte fish featured on the menu. I don't think wasabi tobiko or salmon roe are on the menu, for example.  Here are the highlights, in my humble opinion: Szechuan noodles in chili oil appetizer; sushi Mon-Wed on special (select rolls $2-4) or Sunday is all you can eat for around $30 (amazing deal - SO MUCH IS INCLUDED and taste is far superior to Restaurant Muramoto in my opinion); I've had a few items off the menu written in Chinese so I obviously can't name those, but there's a fish stew made with the Sichuan/numbing pepper and another dish that is served over a flame that both are amazing.. As for drinks (happy hour Thur-Sat), there's this new peach jelly fizzy sake beverage that is SO GOOD... SOOO GOOD!!! Been meaning to check A Mart to see if I can buy a gallon of it...  I'm only removing one star because sometimes service can be a little slow. Water can stay empty for a time, etc. Maybe I drink too fast... Possibly they're a little understaffed during the busy times, but that's why I'm giving 4 vs. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Some dishes are tasty some are not. So be aware the entree you are going to order to avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at VIP on a Sunday. She tried the all you can eat sushi and I had the assorted vegetables.  The vegetables were still partially frozen (obviously from a large bag) and cooked in a very oily sauce that was borderline rancid. The sushi is low quality and the service in between servings is ridiculously slow! sparse, and incomplete. We won't be back and recommend Red Sushi for sushi and Ha Long Bay for anything vegetable-based. The compromise on atmosphere is well worth it for the much higher level of food in either case. We won't be back to VIP and recommend others avoid it."}
{"text":"I used to go here often. The food overall is pretty average but used to satisfy my Chinese food cravings. Last time we visited , a person from our group complained politely about the quality of dish served to that person that day. As a reply to that we were told by the hostess that if we feel they are not serving good food, then we should stop visiting their restaurant! This is diametrically opposite to decent customer service."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to VIP.. From my last visit which was three months back I remember only the taste of #SUSHI.  Im here again to have more of it...Both Volcano and Hell Fire rolls were amazing...."}
{"text":"Once I entered to this restaurant I loved the ambiance; However, for some reason I would have loved it even more if they had like a second floor to dance. Call me crazy but I envisioned this place like that, it reminds me of a discotheque in San Antonio,Texas. My hubby and I liked this place so much that we have been there twice in a week :) the only reason I gave them 4 stars is because of their prices :]  The first time I tried the hibachi chicken (it came with a fried rice volcanoe and saut√©ed zucchini with mushrooms and three pieces of shrimp), despite the huge amount of rice the dish has a nice balance of flavors. I liked the shrimp so much the second time we were there I had to order the hibachi shrimp instead, the texture is great, the perfect crunch in every bite. My hubby had some pork dumplings from the appetizer section and he liked them, he said they were tasty and tender. We also tried some sushi, the California roll and the shrimp tempura, both were good, especially the California one, what I liked the most of their sushi is that everything tasted fresh and you don't taste \"the warmth of the hand\"of the person who made them, I don't know if you understand what I mean, but that's the way I perceive it.  They have a big square table in the middle where you can see how they make the sushi so I think this place could be the perfect place to have some cocktails and sushi with friends or your loved one. I can't wait to come back :)"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and atmosphere was fresh. The lighting and decor was eye catching and vivid. Service was spot on and they smiled often.  Food was spectacular and flavorful. Was brought here by a friend and was not disappointed and would frequent this restaurant if I lived in Madison."}
{"text":"The food portion is not very consistent. Environment feels very high end, but not so much for the food. The price is the similar as many other Chinese restaurant, but I don't feel is worth it, if you consider the flavor. Overall, I would think it's above the average, however it needs some improvements."}
{"text":"I'll admit I was somewhat skeptical of the positive reviews this place has been garnering-- mainly because the restaurant is \"VIP Asian Cuisine\" -- Asian, not Chinese or Japanese or Korean specifically, but just \"Asian\". To me, Asian cuisine is usually a clue for \"really mediocre Americanized Asian-style food\" but this was not the case for VIP.  The interior has a great vibe. Really upscale and trendy. Dimly-lit, but not annoyingly so, with really friendly servers (Gasp! yes, friendly servers!)  Prices are pretty reasonable. $14-18 for Hibachi items, $9-12 for Chinese entrees, and $7 for the Chinese lunch special that comes with fried rice and soup. Bento boxes are $10, and the typical sushi roll will run around $8.  For the food, I was generally very impressed. The Americanized Chinese food was really stellar. General Tsos Chicken and Sesame Chicken had white meat chicken, no tough chunks, and a great sauce that actually had some kick to it (along with some chili peppers).  Authentic Chinese dishes that I tried were pretty solid too. Dan Dan noodles had less pork flavor than I hoped, but it was overall quite tasty and not too oily like you may find elsewhere. The Ma Po Tofu wasn't bad. Lots of tofu, some spice, and a generally good flavor.  The Hot and Sour soup was not good, I thought. No one that ordered it in my party liked it. I'd opt for Egg drop or another soup.  I would suggest going for lunch with a few friends... Get some of the Chinese lunch entrees, maybe a Hibachi item and a Bento box and share! There are lots of options, and the quality seems very high here."}
{"text":"This wasn't the best Chinese food I've ever had, but it was solid, decent Chinese take-out.  I went with pretty traditional items for American Chinese food -- spring rolls, egg-drop soup, steamed dumplings, chicken w/vegetables.  It was all good but not great -- about equal to the take-out place around the corner from my house in Tampa.  Maybe the dine-in experience is better or more noteworthy."}
{"text":"Food was okay, everything kinda bland! The best thing at this place is the sushi.. Don't try the lychee martini tasted like crap also! FYI worst service EVER!"}
{"text":"The WORST Chinese restaurant in Madison. They have no sense of SERVING customers. We will never come back."}
{"text":"The menu is expansive, even on a Friday night there was a discount on cocktails.  The home made noodles were wonderful and service was excellent!"}
{"text":"When you walk in, you feel as if you're not in a Chinese/Asian restaurant. The atmosphere is definitely nice, as is the ambience. However, the food is similar to other, less chic-looking restaurants. It's not bad by any means, but it's still not authentic Chinese food. The sushi, also, is not what I would consider good sushi."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice, a lunch to check it out (I am always skeptical of restaurants that serve multiple Asian cuisines and sushi is pretty weak in Madison in general) and a return trip dinner with the family a month later.  Over these two visits I've eaten sushi, multiple sushi rolls, hand pulled noodles, chicken lo mein, beef and broccoli, and the hibachi steak kids meal.  The food has been very good on both visits.  The sushi (fish) is fresh and rolls well constructed.  The cooked dishes are well seasoned, well prepared, arrived at the table hot and presentation was well executed.  The food has been really good.  The service has been attentive and knowledgable about the menu and food preparation.  I will definitely continue to go to VIP and I do recommend it.  I consider VIP a 4.5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!  Finally, a great Asian restaurant in Madison, Wi.  VIP is tastefully decorated but it's the food quality that will bring me back again.  My wife had the hot & sour soup and I had the egg drop soup:  both were in the BEST EVER category.  We shared the pot stickers, Japanese style shrimp, and steamed whole flounder.  All ranked as the BEST IN MADISON in my book.  Prices and quality resulted in a great value for us.  Can't wait to get back there again."}
{"text":"We ate here last night based on the yelp reviews I read. The atmosphere is super cool with blue lights, very modern and minimalistic. Nice spacing between tables. We were there early in the evening, so it wasn't busy at all. Besides a single rail drink costing $7.00, everything was very good tasting and the portions were nice. Scallops entree was excellent. The waitress was extra sweet, asking the cooks for egg drop soup for my Dad, when its usually not available on weekends. I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Pro's: -I was set down at the bar that's looks into the kitchen which was fun.  -I like the fact that there weren't so many tv's around.  -The food was of good quality.  Con's: -I ordered the coconut shrimp and the dragon roll. Having seen the photo's on yelp I was a bit disappointed with it's appearance. -Even though the place was pretty empty (I was there around 7:30 on a friday) they gave me the constant feeling they wanted to get me out of there as fast as possible. Waitress was acting like she was on the run for something and the bill came while I had barely finished eating and didn't get the chance to ask for a desert. While I was just there to enjoy some good sushi and take my time. -Desert was awfull. Was a pre-fab ice-something with the plastic lid of the factory where it was produced still on it. -No wifi  Overall: good sushi, reasonably priced, not a very good atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I  think I've been to most Asian restaurants in Madison and this one is unique in that they have separate Japanese, Chinese and sushi menus.   Each menu has a mix of traditional, authentic choices and more American interpretations. The sushi was fresh and delicious and the drinks were tasty and fun.  I am picky about my sushi  (I have had my share of questionable ingredient quality served to me.) The sushi here was definitely up to my expectations in both quality and taste. There are special rolls that are worth a try, too.  The decor is modern and clean. The waitress we had was attentive and knowledgeable about the menus."}
{"text":"Very good lunch. Great service, atmosphere and high quality good. Not much else to say or picks to add because other reviewers already posted..."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here for their signature hand-pulled noodle. She thought it was the best noodles she ever had.  Will repeat!"}
{"text":"Slow service because of new open, don't know if things will get better in the future. Waitress not very familiar with food allergy info but very helpful. Taste very good! May come again."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The servants are rude. we found a rubber band in the dish and they didn't even say sorry."}
{"text":"It was really good sushi overall with appetizers and other dishes so there is variety.  It is a little bit more pricey for all you can eat, but if you don't mind then this is a good place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I call ourselves regulars here now! The Sweetheart roll is the best thing I have ever put in my mouth! Never had anything bad or would not get again! Love it!"}
{"text":"The customer service, as some others pointed out, is horrible. The server confused our meal with a similar sounding one, both during serving and billing despite us clarifying. Moreover, they have an apparently concealed way of adding gratuity by themselves and bringing in another slip with a space asking you for gratuity in addition to the one already added to your bill. So, beware while you're \"generously\" tipping because your generosity could amount to 40% as ours did, if you somehow overlook the self-gratuity added by the restaurant. The food on the other hand was decent and delicious."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town! They also have other really great dinner dishes. This place has been packed every time I've ever been. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"The sushi was not fresh at all. We ordered 4 rolls and probably at 6 pieces before throwing them out. The Chinese menu seemed better than the sushi menu. Service was pretty slow, which we expected from reading other reviews. Coconut shrimp was very tasty. The hibachi was pretty bland. I expected more vegetables, I received mostly rice and meat."}
{"text":"One of the top 2 Chinese restaurants in Madison. Comparable to restaurants in the Bay Area. Sushi rolls are excellent. The service and atmosphere are very pleasant. We have eaten in several times and get carry out often. I highly recommend trying VIP."}
{"text":"They have great sushi, hand-pulled noodle, and full service bar. I find that the above mentioned are the things that attract most customers.   The other Chinese dishes, unfortunately, are inconsistent. The meat can be too salty and the soup laden with msg.  I will definitely return but refrain from ordering the Chinese stir fry."}
{"text":"Been here for a few times and every time was a bit disappointing. 2 times the (same) waitress were very passive aggressive--\"oh, sorry I don't speak Chinese\". Yeah nothing wrong with that, but her attitude was really appalling. Other times the ladies were overly friendly and showed much more interest in my husband than me.  There were 2 times on week days we came over for dinner, each time the waiting time is about 30 minutes long, which is suprising for Chinese restaurants. We also didn't seem to have seen other table served with food. Their kong bao chicken seems to use frozen chicken meat, tasted totally unfresh and very saucy, sold for 10.95 or so. In my opinion you can't use frozen chicken for restaurant dishes, otherwise it's just a fancier version of take-out place.  Anyway, I'm not sure if we would come back or not."}
{"text":"The food is great, original and traditional sushi rolls to choose from, the choice of Japanese or Chinese menus makes it easy to go with a diverse group of eaters and still please everyone, and the atmosphere is awesome. It feels like a club with the neon lights and classy seating, but without the noise and rude service. The service is also great: I don't think our waters ever got half empty, and the food came out fast and correct."}
{"text":"Having experience in this restauran is terrible. The server's attitude is really bad. Food is bad. Never visit again"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with my whole experience. The decor is tasteful, the service was great and the prices reasonable. The menu features varied Asian food choices, including sushi, tempura and typical Chinese food. Our waitress made helpful suggestions, and the food was really good. There is no kids menu, but this is no Mickey D's. So much better than many of the Asian food places in Madison and the best on the Westside in my opinion."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times, and has been very good both times across the board. Service, food quality, and atmosphere all have been great.  Have had both the sushi and the Chinese food, top notch on both sides of the menu."}
{"text":"The food was great, the service was great. They had happy hour specials and I loved the Lady Gaga sushi rolls! Nice place overall."}
{"text":"The first thing you will notice when you enter is the traditional Japanese seating to your left. Not only that,  this impressively sprawling restaurant has a sushi bar,  casual seating,  and more intimate seating in the back area that can be used for large parties.   They truly stick to their namesake and treat you like a VIP. We were brought two menus,  one Chinese and one Japanese.  The Chinese menu had Sichuan fares as well as your typical Asian-American dishes to please everyone. The Japanese menu features sushi and familiar bento, hibachi, noodle and rice dishes.  They have a very reasonable sushi and sashimi lunch special every day of the week. This seemed to be popular among other tables near us.   We ordered the futomaki roll, vegetable tempura roll, egg rolls, Dan Dan noodles,  west lake beef chowder,  sliced pork ears, steamed white meat chicken in chili sauce, and Chinese sauerkraut with tilapia soup.  I was let down that the Sichuan dishes did not taste authentic.  While beautifully presented, the traditional hot chili sauce was lacking.  The dishes were not spicy as real Sichuan dishes are.  The Dan Dan noodles were also disappointing,  too much chili oil but no flavor to back it up.  All the Sichuan dishes seemed to shy away from the spicy, numbing, deep complexity of flavors from true Sichuan. Perhaps this is done on purpose to gain wider audience to their menu items.   The sushi rolls are comparable to Takara quality in price and taste.   I still give this establishment four stars because it offers a wide selection sure to cure any cravings, has great ambiance,  relaxed, but friendly service,  and is a good introduction to those who want to try Sichuan cuisine,  but don't want the tears and running nose that goes with real Sichuan flavors."}
{"text":"We ordered some dishes they were excellent. Good flavor. The service was so so. the waiter we had seemed unfriendly when we ask about a dish."}
{"text":"Their sushi rolls are excellent - what a neighboring Japanese restaurant USED to have. The building that VIP occupies used to be a Mexican restaurant which is why the decor on the outside is incongruent to the decor on the inside - which is a cool, modern vibe. I'll go back again to get more sushi and eventually try out the Chinese menu. The service, however, is not stellar. Otherwise, my review would have had 4 stars."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Customer service is really bad. Asking for more tip even though we already left 15 on the table. Never serve us water until we already finish eating and expecting tip."}
{"text":"Even though the food is ok but the service is horrible. When we asked for some plastic boxes, the waiter complained a lot and didn't happy about that. And I have decided not return to this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"We arrived at 6:40 pm on a Friday night. Although the place looked half empty we were told it would be about a 20 minute wait. OK, so we went to the bar to get a drink and wait. The bartender was on the opposite end of the bar from us filling an order for a waitress. When she finished she just left the bar. We waited about 15 minutes and no bar tender returned. We finally asked a passing waitress if we could get a drink. She mumbled something we didn't understand and walked off. 5 minutes later we got tired of being ignored and left. Maybe it was an anomaly but you would think with a half empty restraint someone would take care of the few customer to come in. Can't comment of the food as we never got that far.    Visited March 20, 2015"}
{"text":"From the outside it looks a very unappealing but once you get inside the place is decorated beautifully. I should mention I'm a huge sushi fan and recently moved back to Wisconsin after living in Southern California where no matter where you go, you get good sushi. I crave sushi on a daily basis so I've been trying to visit each sushi restaurant in Madison to decide on my favorite. I don't think this will be my favorite but it wasn't terrible either. We ordered three specialty rolls, edamame and crab rangoons. The best thing I got was the crab rangoons - which isn't sushi at all but anytime I see them on a menu my taste buds force me to order them. These were some of the best I've had. I'd go back to try some of the other dishes. And it might be a good place to go if you have people in your party that don't like sushi and people in your party that do!"}
{"text":"This place was simply wonderful. I have tried several sushi places in Madison (probably all of them) and in my opinion this was the best. I didn't expect this delicious sushi from a place that has both a Chinese and a Japanese menu, but it was really good. The only thing I didn't love was the chef's special. The prices and the atmoshpere was really nice too."}
{"text":"I am debating two stars vs. three for VIP. I got take out for a drive home from a work meeting and, overall, the sushi was ok.   The outside of the restaurant looks either like a former Mexican restaurant or a former Pizza Hut. It is SO dark inside that it is difficult to read the menu. I used the bathroom while waiting for my food and it was like an icebox - SO cold!  I can't say what the 'eat in' experience is like, but the atmosphere of the restaurant was unwelcoming for my take out experience. I doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"Side ginger salad was very fresh and plentiful. I had the Dragon roll which again was fresh fish strips and lota of pickled ginger.  A wonderful first visit.  I will be back again."}
{"text":"Overall I do enjoy VIP. The sushi is great and there is a nice restaurant atmosphere. The other nice thing about VIP is they have happy hour and weekend promotions to make the food affordable.  The issue here is really with the service. It looks like there are enough employees but as a group they really could work on attentiveness, timeliness, and perhaps most important, not messing up orders. Ive dined in and too often the drinks go empty with refills not showing up for 10 minutes. There is no follow up asking if food and orders came out right. Ive called in orders as well where extra things show up in the bag and there is insistence that we ordered it over the phone, resulting in spending money not intended."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday afternoon with two other people. I had looked at pictures online and expected to walk into a restaurant that looked like a club. However, I thought the ambience was great. They have some very original light fixtures, a sushi bar, a regular bar, and great details on the walls. The sushi bar is the focus and center of the restaurant. It's surrounded by one side with tables and booths, price rooms on another, the bar, and then some floor seating on the far wall, near the entrance.  They have 2 menus, Japanese and Chinese. Both were big and interesting, but we stuck with the Chinese for our first shot. The other two in my group ordered the hand pulled noodles, one beef and one vegetarian. The beef was plentiful but fatty. It was perfectly cooked and had great flavor though. The book choy, broccoli, and pea pods in the vegetarian were crisp and fit perfectly in the clear broth. We had decided to try the place for the noodles and they were worth it. They were tasty and fresh, much better then Hong Kong Station's street noodles.  I ordered the crispy duck. I've had horrible luck with duck in Madison. This changed that! It wason par with what I've had in Chicago and London's China Towns. The only complaint I have for the dish was that it came with a spice rub instead of a plum or other sauce. The rub was good, I think it was salt and Szechuan pepper, but I'd prefer a dark sweet sauce.  The main complaint I had was service. We were seated properly and staff was kind and reasonably attentive. The complaint was timing. Right as we ordered another group was getting their food. They sent back a thing of noodles that they said they didn't order. It was brought in back and about a minute later our first noodle order comes out, coincidence? Then we waited 5-8 minutes for the next noodle order to come out. My duck followed this about 5 minutes later. I watched other tables, and they didn't appear to have the same issue though.  Overall great experience. $38 for three large meals and two teas. I will be back soon. I want to say to try the Japanese, but the Chinese was so good who knows. 5 stars if it weren't for the service issue."}
{"text":"The food is A-Mazingggggg! So props to whoever is in charge of that but the customer service is terrible. I also ordered carry out and they said it would be ready in 15 minutes..so I arrived 20 minutes later. I still had to wait 30 minutes after I arrived and it wasn't even busy? What the heck is that all about?? 4 stars for sushi and 2 stars for service"}
{"text":"Pretty crazy happy hour deals, and a very long happy hour. One dollar import beers is a pretty awesome deal.   Service can be hit or miss, but food is reliably good.   Explore the menu, there is a lot of exotic options that you won't see in many other places."}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends. VIP has both Japanese menu and Chinese menu. Ordered beef negimaki, sashimi deluxe, dragon roll and VIP roll. I think they are good qualify considering about the price. Not the best though. Chinese dishes are authentic and tast good, only"}
{"text":"Awesome environment, great lights and music, nice food and nice price. The quite and pleasant atmosphere helps a lot on the food enjoyment."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a new favorite of ours. The first thing I noticed when walking in is the wonderful atmosphere. You can choose to be seated at a booth or table, at the sushi bar, or in a private booth where the table is floor level and you kneel or sit on pillows while eating, which looks like it would be perfect for a small group.   We ordered entrees and sushi and both were delicious. The Alaska Roll was one of the best I ever had. You could tell the ingredients were fresh. My husband had the volcano roll, which was honestly to die for. It was so good. For an entree I ordered the teriyaki New York strip, which  came with miso soup and a salad with ginger dressing and fried rice. The steak and the sides were all tasty and very well prepared. My husband had a dish with fried tofu, and while he said it was pretty spicy, he really enjoyed it. They have a great selection of sake, and unique cocktails. Our server was incredibly friendly and knew the menu very well. She was able to give some very good suggestions. We will for sure be coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"I come to this restaurant once a month with my children. Good selection of sushi rolls, sashimi and drinks. Although a little dark inside I like the atmosphere and attentive staff. Service is fast and prices are accessible. Generous portions!"}
{"text":"Bad food, even worse service! Never going back. And if they keep this up, their business won't last very long.  My sister-in-law and I both have been to this establishment on prior occasion (not very memorable), but decided to stop by for lunch after some shopping anyway as we wanted some Asian food. It was slow, not that many people were there that day. Took a while to get our orders in, but food came back pretty quickly. My SIL ordered two appetizer entrees and a sushi roll. I ordered an entree (Beef with cumin - $14.95) and a sushi roll. Both of our sushi rolls were good (like any other sushi places), but our entrees were not very appetizing at all and my beef with cumin entree was inedible. My sister in law didn't eat much of her entrees, but at least they were edible. I took a piece of the beef from my dish and couldn't taste anything but salt and gritty cumin clumps. It was so overpowering; I asked my SIL to take a bite (one piece of meat), she agreed. When the waitress (Hannah), if you can even call her a waitress as she didn't wait on us at all, finally came back to check on us, I asked her if there was any way to send that dish back and replace it with something more edible. ***NOTE... I've never in my life made such a request anywhere else before, it was just THAT bad.*** Even before I could finish my sentence, Hannah laughed and rhetorically asked, \"Take it back? You eat it already!\" Seriously??? One bite from me and one bite from my SIL?? How else were we supposed to taste our food? Regardless, I didn't say anything else to her and decided I'll talk to the manager before we leave. We didn't touch the dish at all after that. When I went to find the manager, she was on her cell phone in the back. I waited until she hung up and informed her of what happened and the rudeness of her waitress. Hannah was there as well (along with all the other waitresses... this must be where they've been hiding as hardly any of them were present in the dining room). As I was telling the manager, what happened, Hannah started arguing with me. She got so mad, I thought she was going to fling something at me. This whole time, the manager didn't say anything to me but decided to start talking to Hannah in their language, which I did not understand. Finally, she turned to me and ask, \"What do you want me to do about it?\" Surprised by her unprofessionalism, I just said, \"Nothing. Just thought you'd want to know how the service was, but I guess I'll just let others know.\" And I walked away.  Like I said, bad food... but horrible service from the waitress to the manager. Good luck staying in business."}
{"text":"Good Place to eat.  5 Star for Japanese food (non sushi).  4 Starts for Chinese or Sushi here."}
{"text":"Visited for dinner on a Saturday night. Ordered the shrimp/vegetable tempura as an appetizer, a couple of sushi rolls (shrimp tempura and a salmon roll), and the beef Singapore rice noodle, along with a 10 oz vase of saki. What we learned is that it might be better to order their Chinese as the Singapore noodle was very good, but the Japanese side was lacking. The sushi rolls were those really large ones where you can't fit the darn thing into your mouth, so it falls apart. Can get by that if it's delish, but it wasn't delish, just average. The tempura was made in used oil, you could smell and taste that immediately. The texture and shrimp/veggies themselves were good, but that old oil flavor tainted it all. The saki got cold fast, but maybe we just need to be quicker saki drinkers, ha. No points deducted for that. It's nice inside, very roomy and like everyone else has said, has that nightclub look. Service was great. The problem just seems to be that they are trying to be more than what they should. Stick with being a Chinese restaurant and they probably will do well. Try to be a Japanese restaurant, and you're near the bottom of the Madison list."}
{"text":"Oh boy... First they had to ask for direction for making a manhattan, which was on their menu. Then they didn't know what a shellfish allergy meant. When you sell sushi you should probably know the most common seafood allergy. The food was fine but not better than other places in the same price range."}
{"text":"This is a underrated restaurant. The inside is very new and very cool (no windows really, led lighting along the top, and a wonderful waterfall that sets the ambiance) They have monday-wednesday specials where you can get many cheap rolls of sushi for $2-4! They also have many specials including a sushi roll called \"Lady Gaga\", delicious! They also have beautiful entrees that everyone seemed to be enjoying. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After reading a witty yelpers review, the girls and I decided to try for lunch. We tookhis advice and looked up their menu. We went with the sushi OMG n tried the fried ice cream as suggested. Thank you yelper for great advice. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I decided to get some take-out here last Friday. I have to admit when I first walked through the door - there was a very strong (not pleasant) seafood/fish smell that made me want to turn right around and leave but I decided to give it a try anyways. They offer Chinese and Japanese cuisine. I decided to get the spicy crab roll, vegetable tempura roll, and crab Rangoon. The spicy crab roll was very tasty. The vegetable tempura roll was OK, I've had better at other places. The crab Rangoon was VERY tasty. They actually had a substantial amount of filling in them. While I was waiting, I decided to get a drink at the bar. They were having happy hour so I decided to order a whisky old fashioned on special.  I did not like it at all. I'm pretty sure it contained just whisky, water, orange slice, and a cherry. I had to drink some of it down and then ask to add sprite to it - helped but was still an awful drink. I waivered between 3 to 4 stars. Overall I thought the food was good, I would eat here again, but probably would not get a cocktail again!"}
{"text":"Service really is a hit or miss here. Is it as bad as some reviewers say? Yes. It's also just as good... well the food is. I like the hand pull noodles and soba noodles. The chinese appetizers are good too but skip on the spring roll (which are pretty much egg rolls). The spring rolls are crispy and filled with veggies, noodles, and little meat. My wife likes the specialty sushi and the sashimi is good too. Its not the best sushi in town but its good.     I recommend the all you can eat sushi on sunday so you can try a variety of japanese food. Theres a separate menu with rules to follow. Look for the seperate sushi menu in the photo section.     This place shines because of the cool glass front doors, nice interior, awesome bathrooms and the optional good chinese and japanese food. \"Try out your luck\" or not."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of fellow Yelpers on a Tuesday night, and must say that I was fairly impressed with their food.  I definitely came in here with some reservations, not really expecting authenticity and taste to be VIP's strong points given their extremely modern ambiance. I was expecting more along the lines of high quality American-Chinese food that's served at PF Chang's.  Their huge menu, separated into a Sushi menu and Chinese menu, also threw a warning flag for me as I feel like they might be spread too thin.   Thus, given my aforementioned hesitations, I was extremely surprised and impressed to find not only high quality food, but also the authentic taste that comes along with traditional Chinese dishes.   While everyone ordered their own dishes, we passed everything around and sampled most things.  Some of my personal favorites were: Roast duck hand-pulled noodles (highly recommend getting one of their hand-pulled noodles) Sliced beef maw in chili sauce (traditional Szechuan cold appetizer)  Pork dumplings in chili sauce (can't go wrong with dumplings right?) House special pork spare ribs Stir fried string beans  Fried ice cream  Honestly, everything was pretty delicious, from their sushi to their Chinese dishes. They also make a killer mojito that's light and refreshing.   My biggest surprise, however, was how affordable everything was. The hand-pulled noodles ran from $8-9 for a huge bowl. Most entrees were within $10-12. For such a modern and sleek interior, I definitely expected some jacked up prices.   Everything being said, I can comfortably say that VIP is one of the better Chinese restaurants in town :)"}
{"text":"This will be my first 5 star rating. By far the best sushi I have had since moving to Madison.  I has sushi deluxe plate and my wife had spicey Maki plate. Both were amazing some of the freshest fish I have had. The only draw back was our waiter was a little slow at first.  Would recomed to all we will be back to try the Chinese  menu as well."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant after a long time. The food has improved from the time I came in last. The service too has improved from my last experience but still it was pretty slow. Even though there was plenty of empty tables, they took 15 mins to seat us. Once seated, they took another 15 to take our order. In between meals, our server actually came to check in on us. I was pleasantly surprised. We tried some rolls, a hand pulled noodles and a twice cooked pork. I actually enjoyed the rolls- spicy tuna and philly roll. The noodle soup was overly salted- too much soy sauce. Twice cooked pork needed more spice. We asked for some chilly oil to add which made us much better.   In all, I feel they can still do better with their service.  I would go again for sushi but not for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Great sushi and a fantastic atmosphere, which is fancy but still unpretentious.The kind of place where you'll order another roll just to hang out for another fifteen minutes. Service is very good, but be careful with their suggestions or you'll end up spending a lot more than you were planning. Besides the delicious a la carte sushi we also really liked the salmon avocado roll."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back here! This is one of the most relaxing places that I've been to in a while and their food was mostly spot on for my wife and I. We had starter salads w/ ginger dressing, pork dumplings in chili sauce, hot and spicy beef with tofu, and fried rice w/ beef.  Positives:  - They got us seated, drinks, and food pretty quickly.  - Loved the salads, dumplings, and fried rice. All very well done.  - The lighting is a soft blue and very relaxing.  - The entire restaurant layout is very open and pleasant to look at.  - Their bathrooms are clean, the decor is nice, and the lighting matches the rest of the place.  - It was fairly busy for lunch on a Sunday. Enough so that walking in I had a feeling these people already knew something I didn't.  - English obviously wasn't the waitresses first language, which made communication challenging at times, but she did a bang up job getting our orders out and caught when we needed refills.  Negatives:  - The beef and tofu was the only dish out of the lot that wasn't stellar. They'd definitely boiled the beef and tofu in the stew instead of letting them cook and firm up outside of it, which resulted in flavorless, soggy beef, and nearly liquid tofu.  - The waitress had noticeably bad breath and it was a bit off-putting while I was eating. Might not have been her fault, but a stick of gum or a tic tac goes a long way when you're that close to people all day.  All-in-all I really enjoyed this place and I'm looking forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"VIP is our go-to Asian restaurant. The food is always on-point and the price is right. You can order from three different, well-rounded menus: the Japanese menu, the Chinese menu, or the real Chinese menu.   The Japanese menu has great sushi options. We have tried almost everything and have never been disappointed. Order what looks good to you! The seaweed salad is always a nice, fresh accompaniment to the meal. We have tried a few other appetizers--tempura crab, scallop salad--but usually just stick with the seaweed salad and a bunch of sushi. All you can eat sushi on Sundays is dangerous!   The Chinese menu has everything you'd expect like General Tso's, sweet and sour chicken, etc. We have had the hand-pulled noodle soup and west lake soup. Both good! The west lake soup is massive, so order with a group or plan to have leftovers.   And finally, the best-kept secret in Madison is their real Chinese menu, which is only written in Chinese. You can ask your server to translate. Everything on it is authentic, so be ready for bone-in meats and tons of flavor. I'd recommend the hot pot and pork belly, which are the only things I've tried from this menu. But the steamed DIY buns look delicious, so I'll be back to try those. This is definitely a menu to try with a group. It's like taking a trip to China!"}
{"text":"Service falling as the restaurant gets more popular.  Was here with group of 3.  We were given options of either squeeze into a table for 2 or squeeze into corner table next to another group, despite there being plenty of rooms in the back rooms (was told you have to have 4 people to be seated back there).  Makes no sense.  Service was generally slow."}
{"text":"We were excited to try VIP after reading some great reviews. We stopped in for dinner on a Thursday night. The ambiance is nice, but we could tell immediately that our waitress was not knowledgeable or well trained. She didn't know the menu at all- she couldn't answer any of our questions about entrees, and needed us to point out what we were ordering on the menu because she seemed unfamiliar with the names of dishes. She also was unable to make a single recommendation of any dish on the menu. One of our sushi rolls never showed up, and she never apologized, even when we had to ask her to take it off the bill. The seafood hand-pulled noodles were pretty good, though the broth wasn't especially flavorful. Our other items we tried (sushi, appetizers) were fine but nothing special. If the service wasn't so slow and unhelpful, I'd consider trying it again."}
{"text":"They went all out for decoration and layout in this restaurant. Its beautiful inside and very classy. We had the lunch sushi special which is 3 rolls for $10, regular price is $12.25. That's a great deal! And it's comparable to Takara and maybe a little bit more because they add some flair and design to the food presentation.  The service was very good.  We also ordered takeout on another occasion and the staff was very kind and even gave us water while we waited. We will definitely go back and hope that this business makes it. The parking is unusual, making it look less busier than it really is because you are parking along the sides of the building."}
{"text":"So so so disappointed. I have been to VIP a few times and always had a reasonable experience. Their Singapore Noodles are some of the best I have had.  But tonight, when I went in with my boyfriend, we were turned away because their servers were \"busy\" and it was going to take, and I quote, \"30 minutes to clean the table in order to serve you\". That's right, there was no line to wait, there was an open, slightly unclean table, no dishes on it, and the hostess told us that we could not be served for THIRTY minutes. I thought I had misheard so I asked for clarification.... Nope, she said 30!  So disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I was there on a Sunday and it was pretty slow. Then I start wondering if the food was bad. But as a Asian girl I really like their food!! The spicy food was really good. I will definitely take mom here :-) the only thing was they ran out of mints for my drink."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by its weird name and cheap-looking appearance. VIP is a solid, authentic, and good Chinese/Japanese restaurant, probably the best in far West Madison as of May 2014.   Madison has experienced a real boom in authentic Chinese restaurants in the last 5 years. When I come here in 2009, I can barely name 3 restaurants than I consider a \"real thing.\" Now the list is around 15. There was a time people had to travel to Milwaukee for authentic Chinese food, but now the traffic goes the other way around.   VIP (it says \"VIP Asian Cuisine\" on the store front) is the newest addition in this Chinese restaurant boom.   And, VIP distinguishes itself from other Chinese places by its very trendy and classy dining environment. It is not decorated by cheesy faux-Chinese art pieces. It is much akin to the setting that you can find in modern day bourgeois urban China, and I cannot recall being to similar place in the Midwest.   VIP's has long and comprehensive menus--one for Chinese and one for Japanese. The Chinese menu contains many Szechuan/Sichuan dishes like Fugu and Ichiban, but it also has items not to found in other places. The prices are comparable to Fugu and Ichiban, too. It definitely takes time for the first-time visitor to navigate the menu, but everything seems to be are pretty \"safe\" choice.    If you cannot decide, than stick to the noodle section like I did. VIP handmade their noodles, yes, handmade, so that makes all the difference if you know what I am talking about.   For less adventurous eaters, VIP also serves American Chinese, and there is an entire thick sushi menu to explore.   This restaurant is huge. It has many private and semi-private rooms for special occasions. All the servers we encountered today were very helpful and friendly. Based on my first visit, VIP is a solid and authentic Chinese restaurant. Let's see how their business will go, It has a chance to become the top Chinese restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"VIP was one of favorite restaurants of my family for a while.  I was excited to hear that they started AYCE on Sundays.  As soon as I found out AYCE, I went there with my family 5/22/16.  I was even worried about if the place was packed with so may people.    When we arrived around 12:15, the place was almost empty and very tired and bored looking server took our drink orders and the first order.  Even my son said the server looked angry.  I was really confused from my previous experiences at VIP, the servers at the place had been very friendly, nice and even fast.  When I do the first order I was so surprised I can order only 3 items at one time.  That means I can order only 6 piece of sushi or sashimi and wait.  We waited for more than 10 minutes and no food came out.  I did not want to spend a couple of hours to eat several pieces of sushi and sashimi.    We left the place.  They still charged all drinks.    Even when we leave they did not care.  Now I am so glad that I left VIP at the moment even though I paid for all the drinks barely touched.  That saved my Sunday.  Because of VIP, we just found another nice place in Madison."}
{"text":"Sushi craving kicked in and we wanted to avoid the downtown traffic after a UW football game, so we looked a little further and found VIP. I was a little skeptical by the spotty reviews on service here, but from what I could see the sushi was really good based on other reviews. To our surprise our waitress was on point, she was quick to greet us and help us out with the menu. We wanted to do the sake bombs, and she made it work with the happy hour special- ask for regular (not flavored) sake on the happy hour menu to be warmed up and a sapporo beer if you're interested. The happy hour goes from 430-930 Thurs-Sun...what a steal. We ordered the dragon roll and hot babe roll and two spicy tuna hand rolls.  The specialty sushi rolls usually come as 8 pieces and are priced 12-14$. Hand rolls are not on the menu, but we asked for them, and again she was able to accommodate us. Sushi was good, tasted fresh."}
{"text":"My new favorite Madison restaurant. Best of the best. Elegant atmosphere, prompt service, an incredible progressive Chinese (not the usual nor traditional) and Sushi menu. The unagi maki was the best I've had, the beef soup indescribably good with chili oil and vinegar. The plain outside hides a beautiful interior-I kind of like that."}
{"text":"This place is terrific.  Sushi rolls are inventive, delicious, and beautiful.  We had the special, with scallops and tuna, and another wrapped as a triangle with white seaweed.  The latter had three dipping sauces, one was a mango reduction with truffle?  And don't miss the hand-pulled noodles on the Chinese menu.  The broth is fabulous.  Nice body, star anise comes out prominently, and not too salty.  Brisket chunks were meaty and tender.  Also, lychee martini = yum!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but service is really bad. You wont ever find your server when you need him/her. Been there a couple of times because its hard to find good chinese restaurant in madison, never enjoyed their service. Finally decide to give up. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while, I have tried many of the entrees with tofu and both the japanese and chinese menu.   Appetizers   Age Tofu 4/5 - Nice soft tofu squares.  Seaweed Salad 5/5 - I really like this. I will sometimes get it as an appetizer with a unique taste. Favorite Sushi is the Avocado Roll. Sushi isn't great to me being a vegetarian but that's the case everywhere. Sze-Chuan Green Bean Curd w/ chili oil 5/5 - I'm a fan of this. I've never had it anywhere else before but I like the taste/spiciness level.  Favorite Entree    Kung Pao Sauce w/ Tofu.   My only complaint about most every entree is they lack a real hit of spice despite the little red pepper next to it on the menu. This is a problem at most places for me is they are \"too safe\" on spice or they don't kick it up much.   Service  Very attentive and clean restaurant. Sometimes lacks bathroom amenities including soap or toilet paper-beware!  Bonus Points  The beer and alcohol prices during happy hour is amazing! I love having a $2 IPA with my meal!  Beer $2.00 House Wine $3.00 Flaved Sake $3.00 Mai Tai Blue Hawaiian $5.00"}
{"text":"This was excellent food!  I had the General Tso chicken, my wife has the general Tso Tofu. It was the best we've had in a long time.   The room is quite, in spite of being over half full when we arrived. The atmosphere is attractive. The wait staff is friendly and attentive. The price was right too.   Next time I'm in Madison in need of good Asian food I need look no further."}
{"text":"Don't know where these 3 score comes from. This place is perfect for me!!! I even want to cry when I tasted the beef ramen which is hand-pulled and with delicious soup. This restaurant offers really Chinese and Japanese food, not the American Chinese food. The sashimi is very fresh! The sushi is also amazing! And the price is much more reasonable than other Chinese restaurant in Madison.  I feel falling in love with this place after dinner and definitely will come again every weekend. A fantastic restaurant !!!!!"}
{"text":"VIP serves the best fried rice in town (in my opinion).  They have fresh sushi too!  The service is friendly and the restaurant is clean.  Every time we eat there we wonder why we don't go more often!"}
{"text":"I had sushi and dessert. Both were tasty. I enjoyed the simple rolls more than the specialty rolls. Dessert was Tiramisu - surprisingly awesome."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I have not been here for a while since there grand opening, at the time I loved the place. Today they services me one special roll with thinnest fish ever and second one (I ought I'd give them a second change), nope. On the photo from menu the rolls looks wrapped with tuna and they brought me tiny rolls with tiny piece of tuna on the top. See photo. When I asked why such a radical difference they looked at me as if I was an idiot and it was supposed to be that way. Later I was told they have two new chefs. I will not go there again. Their premium rolls are compared to Red Sushi entry level rolls, although even those much fresher, and appetizing. Will not return."}
{"text":"We generally love our experience at VIP and we've eaten here several times. Good ambience in general but a few notes: (1) the music is repetitive, we heard the same songs at least twice (2) dinner took forever to get to us -- definitely hit the dinner rush (3) we had a coupon that says it's good for use anytime on anything...except it's not. They refused to let us use the coupon on the All You Can Eat. Really bizarre, not great customer service in that regard; it has me a little peeved.   Otherwise, they have some great rolls: Lady Gaga, Dragon, Caterpillar Meh Rolls: Spider, Spicy Crab"}
{"text":"So glad we found VIP! Originally went as a sushi date, but we have since tried their meals and they compliment the sushi well! Their Monday - Wednesday deal is great!"}
{"text":"Food is good, normal Japanese fare.  The vibe and decor of the place is interesting.  When you enter, you see a neon looking bar.  Nice looking, but I remember thinking - am I in a club or a japanese restaurant?  There is a nice koi pond in there as well.  From the outside, the place looks like nothing, but inside, it looks like a club.  Top 40 and kinda of dark.  It felt slightly out of place on a random Tuesday at 5:00pm and more of a weekend vibe.    The chicken teriyaki was poppin, though."}
{"text":"This is one of several great places along Odana that you might accidentally miss driving by, along with Los Gemelos and the Silver Cinemas movie theater.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's larger than the entrance leads you to believe.  We went for the sushi special they offer on weekends, and both the selection and quality were good.  My favorites were the sweet potato roll and tuna nigiri.  Muramoto is another good sushi place, but it doesn't have quite the variety that VIP does, and the prices are a little better, though I do prefer Muramoto's weekday lunch specials and appetizers.  The servers here are very attentive, and our food always arrives in a timely manner."}
{"text":"The lunch time special here is the best. We have been looking for a Sushi place that offers not only good quality for the basic rolls, but also something different for the Maki.   The special is on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and you cannot beat the prices. The staff is friendly, and accurate. They get you in and out.   I like the interior. It's very relaxing with the low lights, and the Koi pond. We have now gone here for lunch 5 times and will continue."}
{"text":"Good sushi at a surprising place.  Looks nondescript from the outside but when you enter, you feel like you are in a city restaurant."}
{"text":"What a surprise!   Visited here on a Monday night with a group from work.  I too was a bit hesitant given the sushi and chinese menus, but we came anyway.  We started with drinks. $2 off pricing on most drinks, so those that did drink were pleased. We went with a variety of apps.  Vegetable tempura, dumplings, and edemame. All were done well and gobbled up.    Several went with the shrimp tempura bento and could not finish-too much food. Large delicate shrimp, salad, rice, dumpling and california rolls. Others got sushi, and enjoyed them all.  Tasty, fresh, and pleasing. Dessert came and fried icecream, tempura oreos and tempura cheese cake- again great! Looking forward to coming back and trying the chinese menu, but may have to further explore the sushi menu first."}
{"text":"My favorite staple restaurant. They do authentic boiled Szechuan and everything is always super tender and fresh. Sushi is also amazing and fresh. The staff is super friendly and attentive.  The only thing I can say is I wish they would change the 90s pop soundtrack that plays on repeat. Trivial, I know."}
{"text":"The sushi is similar to other places. The hand pulled noodle bowls are really good. A few of the Chinese dishes are pretty authentic, it might have pretty descriptive names but it is basically peasants food similar to what you would find if you're in a rural area in China such as the bowl of blood, intestines, tripes, cabbage, and spam although  I don't recall spam in the dish when I was a child, there is probably spam now in rural China. We had a group of twenty six and we were done within two hours and that was with a lot of conversations and passing around the food. The duck is deep fried and it is pretty dry so I would forego the duck. The bento boxes had small portions and lackluster in color and taste. The fried rice and fried noodles are typical of other fusion places. The salad was typical lettuce salad like what you would find at apple bees or Denny's. The sushi rolls are typical rolls nothing special about it, I couldn't recall the names after I ordered. The dishes with a broth are the only ones I find exceptional."}
{"text":"VIP has the best Chinese food in town. The hand-pulled noodles and pork belly are really great. All of the vegetable dishes are delicious and huge. I go there whenever I feel homesick and miss my mom's Chinese cooking. Go with the traditional dishes."}
{"text":"We went for all you can eat sushi on Sunday a little bit before dinner rush. They had good special roles and I personally Ioved the tamago egg sashimi. They do have rules that will only allow you to order three plates, but soup and salad didn't count toward the 3. I enjoyed miso with the delicious roles. We enjoyed the food so much, that we decided to come back on a week night for Chinese. They have good boiled beef in spicy sauce. One of the best I've had in Madison. My boyfriend liked their Sesame chicken also. A little salty and sweet for my taste, but over all, I think VIP deserves at least 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good service, reasonable price. I love the bento  boxes either salmon or steak. Unique among asian joints definitely."}
{"text":"I was super skeptical of a place that serves Japanese and Chinese. Turns out I was right. It's really too bad because it's actually a very cool space. Waitstaff is unfriendly and service is poor. There were four of us and we all ordered four different cocktails. Each one was just weird. Not necessarily gross but just weird and nothing I'd ever want to drink again. Our edamame was a peculiar temperature. The sushi was nothing to write home about. I didn't have any strange smelling fish like some of the other reviews but certainly nothing tastes all that fresh. They have some odd combinations but not unique in a good way. The only redeeming item of the night the pork dumplings in chili sauce. Delish! Alas, my search for good sushi in town continues."}
{"text":"To explain where I'm coming from with this review, I have to say I'm an Army brat and a traveler, and I've sushi multiple times in almost every state in the US. In my adult life I've become a bit of a sushi snob, and it saddens me to give this low of a rating. We came in on our trip to Minnesota and they said they had an AYCE menu on Sunday, so I said sure, why not. $26? NOT WORTH IT. We got the menu and saw that there was a rule where you can only order three things at a time... meaning,  you have to finish all your food before ordering anything else. So... we get our 6 nigiri, rangoon, soup and rice. The nigiri was okay, but the fish was sliced paper thin and there was too much rice. Rangoon was great, as were the clear soup and fried rice. The shrimp fried rice was very rich and oily, but it was probably the best thing on their menu. I ordered one dragon roll and it had an odd vinegar smell/taste so I refused to eat it because it seemed off. Our waitress was constantly apologizing and stumbling over herself, and we weren't sure if she was new or having a bad day, or what was up with her. To be honest, this restaurant should stick to Chinese food instead of offering sushi."}
{"text":"They made the best Chinese food in Madison. The sitting is very comfy and spacious. With plenty of parking. The service mostly do fine. Food comes fairly fast. Not just they taste great. But with decent portion and reasonable price. I highly recommend VIP if you want to enjoy some nice Chinese food without breaking the bank. They also have sushi and certain days have discount on that. Their sushi rolls are quite decent too."}
{"text":"This place is solid, though all I had was a Sushi Bento.  The atmosphere, the service and the prices were all decent.  I will most certainly be back for their hand-pulled noodles!"}
{"text":"Watch out Japanese sushi restaurants and Szechuan Chinese restaurants, you have a formidable new rival and VIP serves up both, really, really well.  Located next to Saigon Noodles in a separate parking lot, this is the new kid on the block.  The sushi isn't just decent for Madison, it's really really good.    If you can't decide what noodle soup to order, start with the beef noodle soup, they make their hand pulled noodles in house."}
{"text":"So this four star review is a mix of a whole bunch of feelings.  1) Originally, I saw that this place was a Chinese Japanese fusion. Okay, I usually have a minor grudge against places like this. NOT ALL OF ASIA IS THE SAME. But they have definitely won me over! Their clear delineation between Chinese menus and Japanese menus soothes my little-bit-too-sensitive-half-Asian soul.  2) The fish is pretty good. I was not super impressed by the love boat. IT'S NOT IN A BOAT, and the roll was reallllyy okay. But the fish is fresh, and when I got sashimi once... nomnomnom it was delicious! I would give 3 stars I think for the sushi.  3) However... five stars for the Chinese!!  Their duck handpulled noodles are amazing. Seriously. The noodles are excellently done and chewy in just the right way.  The star of the show though... Apparently they have a \"super secret\" (not really secret, but kind of in that they don't give it to white looking folks) Chinese menu that is actually in Chinese, and that is where all of the real stuff is. Luckily, I creeped on another table and saw they have hot pot... yaaaasss. The waitress was super nice and explained the options to me since I can't read Chinese and helped me order the hot pot (single person portions only!). I got lamb and beef raw on the side so we could cook it to the doneness we wanted. And I've officially fallen in love with this place. My friend who I came with said that it was literally everything she's ever thought was missing from Chinese food. It was perfectly spicy and savory, the meat was delicious, and the glass noodles in it were perfect. Not overdone!  My new craving."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi in Madison!  With a great amount of seating and rarely a wait, this hidden gem is the perfect go-to no matter what night of the week.   Monday-Wednesday they have incredible sushi specials (Philly for $3.75, California for $3.25, etc.) Thursday-Sunday treat yourself to $2 beers and $3 house wines! With extensive Chinese and Japanese menus, there's sure to be something for everyone.  The atmosphere feels similar to a modern lounge/nightclub with dark mood lighting and booth seating--great for a night out or even a weekday lunch!  The food is always fresh and delicious and the servers are extremely kind. Have become a very frequent diner here and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Although the food was authentic and satisfying for a born-and-raised Chinese, I've decided not to return to VIP because of the irritatingly bad service. My friends who went along with me shared the sentiment. The waitress serving us was unfriendly, sulky as if we owed her money (to borrow a Chinese idiom). When we asked for plastic containers to bring home a large amount of leftovers (many dishes are very saucy which would leak out of styrofoam boxes and make a mess), the waitress was reluctant and accused us of being wasteful. In the end, she yielded but kept shooting dirty looks our way. Also, she brought ONE plastic bag for the leftovers for the FIVE of us!  And unfortunately, you can't reflect the quality of the service in the tip because they charge a FIXED GRATUITY OF OVER 20%!!! Better read your receipts carefully because they surely don't tell you about it if you don't ask!"}
{"text":"Do not eat at this restaurant!!! My wife and I went there for the first time tonight and will never go back. The decor is awkward, the menu is confusing, the service was fairly non-existent, and the food was disgusting. If I could give it a no-star rating I would. DON'T GO!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here about 4 times. the lunch special is a good deal. I love it, many traditional chinese dishes can be found on lunch special menu. They used to have hand pulled noodles on special too, but they removed it recently, too bad. Their hand pulled noodles ( Beef one) are super good, very tasty! I have not tried sushi and other dishes. They offer many choices, way too many in my opioin. I heard their chef is from New york, and won some rewards for making sushi. I will try next time."}
{"text":"I loved the hand pulled noodles! Sooo good! Sushi and cold chicken were also excellent and flavorful! Will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I've only dined in for lunch during their Mon-Wed basically half price sushi special. But whether it's dine in or carryout the service is fast and friendly every time.   They have a great selection of vegetarian rolls and are one of the few places in town with a sweet potato roll on the menu.   Quality is consistent with good presentation. Not the best sushi in town, but probably #2 or 3. And for less than $10 for lunch on discounted days you can't go wrong.   End your meal with a complementary small Japanese candy."}
{"text":"I honestly disliked this place. My table was ignored and even as I went to ask the waiter something, she would act like she didn't hear. The food was horrible except for the dragon roll."}
{"text":"This is a mid-week lunch review. Great prices for lunch. I got 3 roles and a martini for less than $20. The bar prices are a little hit-or miss. I don't think they're trying to overcharge, but I've been there 3 times in a month- order the same thing each time, and have been charged 3 different prices for the martini. The rolls are great, service is decent. There is a decent sized bar, booths, and a sushi bar for seating. The place is huge, but they did a good job with the seating and making nooks to make it more intimate. I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"I've been here several times but my most recent vist was for lunch on a Sunday. There is all you can eat sushi for 26$ on Sunday I didn't get this deal but maybe another time. At this restaurant you are able to order either Japanese food or Chinese food. My food was good I ordered vegetable tempura and some sushi. Being from Los Angeles I know 5 star sushi this place is pretty good not full 5 stars but I like the food environment and service. The restaurant is clean and the ambiance is relaxing. I've had the hibachi on previous visits and I think it's delicious. Definitely try it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"I've now been to VIP three times, though this review will focus on my latest trip. My husband and I walked in at about 7:10 pm on a Sunday night and were seated right away (it was a 45 minute wait at Sushi Muramoto, and we were hungry). Sunday special is all-you-can-eat sushi for $26/person, and after looking at their menu we decided to partake.   Included in the $26 is any of the appetizers listed on the all-you-can-eat menu, along with several choices of soups. Lots of sashimi and nigiri options, with sushi and special rolls as well. It was quite a large menu to choose from.  Happy Hour was from 4:30-9:30, so we also had some of their drink specials.  We were pleasantly surprised that our orders came out quickly. The restaurant was busy, though not overly so. Our server was attentive and refilled our water glasses without prompting. We tried several special rolls (Dragon, Da Bomb, and Spider to name a few) as well as a California and Spicy Tuna. All the rolls I tried were delicious.   The reason I deducted one star is for their use of \"crab stick\", also known as fake crab. I do not particularly like fake crab, so was disappointed to see it on the menu. However, I will say that I am so glad the menu makes a distinction that it's crab stick and not just a generic \"crab\" - in this case I could avoid it (My husband doesn't mind it and did enjoy the rolls with crab stick). There were rolls that denoted soft shell crab, so they do not exclusively use crab stick, which makes me happy.   All in all, VIP is a solid 4 star experience."}
{"text":"Terrible service.   Two people serve the whole restaurant, and if you complaint about how they keep ignoring you, they would just tell you to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I am naturally suspicious of any restaurant that features ginormous menus. This place has not one giant menu, but two! Chinese (Szechuan), and Japanese. We ordered sushi from one, and Singapore noodles and Hand Pulled Noodle Veggie Soup from the other. WOW. Everything was amazing!  Sushi: we got the spicy tuna roll ($5.95), a spicy scallop roll ($5.95), and one specialty roll: \"The Hot Babe\" - Tuna, cucumber and Jalape√±o inside, topped with shrimp and special sauce ($12.95). All of them were fantastic, and we were both in agreement that the spicy scallop was our favorite. Not too much rice, just perfect.  The Singapore street noodles ($9.95) were seriously the best we have ever had in town (and trust me, we have tried these at no less than 12 Madison establishment) - kind of an obsession, perhaps? At some places they overload with curry and salt, but at VIP the flavors are perfectly balanced, and the dish is chock full of shrimp, chicken and beef. Happily, thanks to the giant platter of sushi we started with that filled us up, we took have the noodles home for later.  We confirmed with our friendly waitress (who checked on us regularly and happily explained menu items and gave us her suggestions), that the \"hand pulled noodles\" were indeed made right there at VIP. Sold - we got the vegetable hand pulled noodles ($7.95) which was a giant bowl of soup. The broth was light and flavorful, and the noodles...oh, the noodles!! Clearly fresh, chewy and delicious! Happily again, we brought half of it home for later!  Our bill arrived with the same yummy guava hard candies that Ha Long Bay offers. Love those little guys! Other reviewers have mentioned the decor/ambiance. Very cool place - and the dishes and tea cups are so adorable! Though the soy sauce bowl for the sushi was almost identical to my tea cup, and I almost plunged my spicy scallop into my green tea! Stopped myself just in time. They also had quite an extensive drink/cocktail/sake/wine menu, which I hope to try on a future visit (which will likely be VERY SOON!!!!!)."}
{"text":"Great food. Been there several times. They have come a long way since they opened first. I initially didn't really find them better than other Chinese places like Ichiban or Soga Shabu Shabu. But recently they have definitely upped their game, so much so, that weI find ourselves heading here more often than not when we crave Chinese food.  Hot and Spicy Beef with Tofu and some fish in a red hot broth (listed only on the Chinese menu) are favorites.   The only thing I that gets me down a bit is that the servers would always speak only Chinese even if we have a mixed company with a single Chinese person. Nothing wrong with that. But there are others who clearly don't understand you. Good service means making all your customers feel at ease. Plus, most of the times we need to go pick up our own chopsticks, the servers invariably forget them.   Food however, is awesome."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a review of VIP since we went there for my birthday in March.  First, I love sushi though I'm hardly an expert.  I ordered two of the \"fancier\" rolls although I can't recall which ones and they did not disappoint.  Everyone at our table enjoyed what they ordered.  Now for the reason I wanted to take the time to submit a review -- the service was very slow that night.  It was a Saturday and I believe we went at 5:30pm.  People at nearby tables arrived after us and left before us.  The four of us were running out of conversation and more than ready for our food when it arrived nearly two hours later.  The staff apologized and informed us they had a large party they were serving.  Then the unheard of happened -- they showed up with four desserts on the house for us!  We were shocked, usually you can consider yourself fortunate just to get a \"sorry\".  We happily dug into our desserts and since it was four of us dining out, we did enjoy each other's company so all was forgiven.  I will definitely be back but if it is just hubby and I, hopefully we hit it at the right time as we no longer have the patience for a two hour dinner and free dessert might not make up for it."}
{"text":"We came here craving sushi and wanting to celebrate the new year. We will definitely be back regardless of the occasion! We were seated immediately arriving at 6 pm on a Friday, and the restaurant was very clean and modern looking. The open floor plan in the middle was really awesome, and the sushi bar was huge! We choose to sit at a booth since it was a date night, but made plans to come back for a basketball game this season at the bar!  Happy hour prices were outstanding...2$ beer and 3$ wine from 4:30 to 9:30 is unheard of in this city and it was awesome. There were lots of choices for both sushi or cooked food on the menu. We tried the dragon roll (delicious), spider roll (you say spicy mayo, I say get in my belly!) and the Alaskan roll. All were amazing and the prices were way more reasonable than other sushi joints (I'm looking at you Red) that we were considering. Service was decent and lots of parking. We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly impressed by this place- the location has been many other restaurants in the past- it's got an ugly exterior and just looks weird.  BUT when I walked in, I totally felt like a VIP!  The interior decor is beautiful- very classy with huge sushi bar in the center and alcohol bar towards back wall.  The bathroom was pretty.  Ok- onto the food.  There are two extensive menus- one with Chinese cuisine and one with Japanese stuff like sushi and bento box.  I thought sushi sounded delish but was a bit pricey.   Chinese stuff looked really good too.  We both ended up getting bowl of hand pulled noodles- I got roasted duck and my boyfriend got beef tendon.  Whoa!  It was amazing!  My bowl came with a good amount of duck plus three pieces of fresh bok choy.  The beef tendon was so delicious and flavorful.   Both our broth tasted similar but it was so good.  It didn't taste like they just threw in a bunch of MSG.  I am going back at lunch to try sushi (was priced much better). By the way, our noodles were only $8.95 each bowl which I thought was very reasonable.  This place was so nicely decorated, I can easily see it hosting weddings, etc.  But everyone there was dressed very casual-  I had arrived in my workout clothes and I felt alright.  It's a four star for now since I haven't tried sushi- I hope to eventually give this place five stars after trying other dishes.  Service was professional and friendly- very efficient with order, requests for chili sauce and bill."}
{"text":"Probably the best spicy yellowtail roll I have had in Madison. And for only $5.95, a steal!   Their sushi rolls are top notch, and right in line (if not a little cheaper) price-wise with the Muramoto's of the world. Great, fast service, cool ambiance, this place definitely has a lot going for it.   The first time we came here we ordered the kung pao chicken and it was the best I have had in Madison. Crispy, spicy, tender...it was overall fantastic. Went here again last weekend and ordered it, and was very disappointed. Either they changed their recipe or we got the wrong dish one of the two times. This time it came with a lot more vegetables, non-crispy chicken, no hint of spice. It was like they ordered it from Chang Jiang and put it on a plate to serve to us. This is the only reason they don't get 5 stars from me. The sushi is fantastic, menu is huge, but I can't give it 5 stars given the odd experience with the Kung Pao Chicken.   Also to note, they have all-you-can-eat sushi on Sundays for $26! Will definitely check that out in the future."}
{"text":"My teenage son and I have eaten here four times now, and the food has always been delicious.  For the adventurous eater, we recommend the stirfried pork intestine or stirfried pork kidneys."}
{"text":"When your girlfriend comments that the piece of candy that came with the bill was the best part of the meal, you know it was bad. After reading all the great reviews, we came with high hopes and left extremely disappointed.  I started getting nervous when I saw the library of menus dropped off at our table.  I'm not a math major but I know that too many menu options = mediocre food.  This was definitely the case with our dinner.  We shared: Pork Dumplings with chili oil-Dumplings were literally submerged in the oil and quickly fell apart when picked up Spicy Tuna and a Yellowtail roll-Both rolls suffered from overcooked and mushy rice Duck with handpulled noodles-Noodles were solid but the broth was severely under seasoned and lacked any flavor. Most of the duck had gristle.  I will continue to watch for other reviews and may give it a second chance but at this point, VIP is DOA to me."}
{"text":"I stopped back in here with my boyfriend and a friend. I'm so pleased to say everything I disliked before has been improved on. The rolls no longer have too much rice. The lunch specials are insanely well priced.  I only had one roll that I wasn't in love with. Everything else was delicious. The sushi was fresh and well made.  VIP definitely still isn't my favorite sushi place in town, but I will surely be coming in for their lunch specials regularly now."}
{"text":"Short version: For the price, VIP is great. The food is good for this price range, but don't expect 5-star quality food. You'll feel better spending $10-15 on decent sushi here rather than spending $40-50 on great sushi at Morimoto.   VIP is a cross between a night club and restaurant, but don't let the dark lighting turn you off. Monday-Wednesday is the time to come if you like sushi, as a selection of rolls are discounted to just $2-4 each. They also have lunch specials on the Chinese menu every day.   The food is all pretty good but nothing to write home about. However, the great prices for decent sushi keep me coming back again and again."}
{"text":"After reading all the positive reviews, my friends and I were so excited to try VIP. I'm convinced we came on an off night, but our experience here was so terrible that I'm unwilling to come again.   I set a reservation for 7:30, and we arrived at 7:25. We weren't greeted for at least 10 minutes, and the hostess finally told us to sit at the bar until she could get our table ready. Bartenders didn't acknowledge us, and the hostess forgot about us. Finally, after almost 15 more minutes, I reminded the hostess that we were waiting for our table, and she immediately sat us in the back corner. Granted, this all happened while the restaurant was not very busy and we clearly saw many open tables.  Server did not greet us for another 10 minutes, and she rushed our drink orders. Took us almost half an hour to put our dinner orders in. I got the pulled noodles in a duck broth and spicy salmon roll. Spicy salmon roll was pretty good. Pulled noodles? The worst noodle dish I ever had. All of us had a variation of the noodle dish, and all of our noodles were too soft, fell apart when we tried to eat it, and so \"swollen.\" I wanted to ask for our checks, but the server never came back. I assumed she was busy (mostly because she was completely nonexistant for our entire meal). We waited for a long time, and when I went out to find her, her and ALL the other servers we're behind the bar laughing and chatting! I would have forgiven the terrible service if they were busy, but they clearly were not. I was livid.  Nonexistant service, and not very good food. I will admit, I enjoyed the sushi rolls and the plum wine. My boyfriend said his wine tasted like it'd been sitting out. In fact, our soggy noodle dishes tasted like it'd been sitting out too. My friend from Illinois was unimpressed, and we were upset that this is the restaurant we chose to represent Madison's amazing food scene. I'm unwilling to try this place again any time soon."}
{"text":"Eaten here 3 times in the past year and each one has been exceptional. Very good sushi and even better on Sunday night with the unlimited sushi, appetizer, soup, salad, etc. special."}
{"text":"I've had a chance to visit VIP several times now, I've only really tried the sushi here and nothing else.  1 included side - miso soup 1 appetizer - sweet potato cakes 3 roll lunch - 1 eel roll, 2 shrimp tempura  The miso is actually quite good here, with their seaweed packing quite a bit of flavor. The sweet potato cakes may not be for everyone, as they're soft, chewy, and can be unnerving to the wrong palette.  From a sushi perspective you can't really beat 3 rolls for $13-$14. Most of the sushi bars in Madison on the West side have frozen their prices right around this mark. VIP's offering is really standard in terms of what everyone else offers, the difference however falls on portion size and overall taste.  Comparable to Fuji in Greenway, but from a taste standpoint VIP takes it by a nose. Affordable, but you might be waiting for a while as it takes time to make a fresh roll. This is about the case in any sushi house you visit."}
{"text":"Awesome value for the price and atmosphere. Food is delicious and their dine in lunch specials are outrageously cheap!!"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover! This place looks super sketchy from the outside, but the inside is BEAUTIFUL, and the sushi is great. The \"all you can eat\" sushi offered on Sundays is 10x better than Muramoto's AYCE deal. There are so many more options at VIP, whereas Muramoto is so stingy with their AYCE menu. Plus, you can order 3 rolls/dishes at a time, and at Muramoto you can only order 2 at a time. Not to mention, it's $5  cheaper at VIP and there are so many more choices. Muramoto doesn't even offer sashimi with their all you can eat menu. The special rolls at VIP are so amazing and creative. The volcano roll and Lady Gaga roll are my personal faves. The regular rolls and sashimi at VIP are very fresh, but otherwise pretty average. Definitely not bad, but not the best in town by any means. If you want all you can eat sushi on a Sunday, I would highly recommend going to VIP instead of Muramoto. I have seen complaints about the service at VIP, but I have never had an issue whatsoever. And the people complaining about the \"rules\" of the AYCE menu and about how they won't except coupons when you order AYCE need to get over themselves. It's a great deal, and the fact that they don't accept coupons is listed right on the menu, and it is totally reasonable seeing as how you can get all the sushi you want for $25. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Place is weird as fuck. The outside looks like an abandoned Mexican bank while the inside jives like a trendy Vegas nightclub. They have a section of Japanese-style seating which I am pretty sure has never been used.  Menu is long as hell, so the place is a jack of all trades, master of only their homemade noodles. The sushi rolls are pretty good but I don't think anyone is jizzing their pants about it.  Waitstaff has difficulty communicating sometimes, bringing soup instead of salad, not knowing how to explain the lunch menu... that sort of thing.   All in all it is a good Asian place on the west side, but let's just say it's the kind of place that attracts people with spray-tans"}
{"text":"This is a review for the Chinese food. My mom is a regular here so we decided to check it out and see if it's as good as what we get in Southern California. Much to my surprise, this place is legit. Their Chinese food is on par with So Cal. We had the string beans (perfect), stir fried pork in garlic sauce (just spicy enough and well cooked), and the jjam ppong, which is a spicy hand pulled noodle spicy soup. Everything was delicious! My kids ordered the CA rolls and salmon/avocado roll, both of which were good. The portions are large, and the food is on point."}
{"text":"Being there many times ,food is going down hill ,service ? Ha there's no such things,I have a friend used to work there ,told me that has been change so many chefs ,and there's no hand pull noodles at all ,that's machine noodles ,ask anybody there who can show you hand pull noodle how to make it?or ask server have they ever seen people making hand pull noodles there?i think now it's time to quit coming here because there are not honor people who runs the place"}
{"text":"Wow!!! The happy hour and meal were amazing. Great food and will be back soon! Nice happy hour and beautiful place! Our wait staff was very attentive . I was just amazed that this PLACE was not packed. Best crab Rangoon I have ever had anyplace. It's a hidden gem... for now! A must for sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to sushi place. It looks iffy from the outside, but once you get inside you see how nice it is. Their Monday-Wednesday deal for their rolls is a great deal! Definitely worth a try"}
{"text":"Okay, so this place is kind of great!  VIP has a very unique and maybe even a bit of an intimidating menu if one isn't adventurous.  With that said though, I am a huge fan of this place.  The menu is large with Chinese and Japanese options.  I have only tried the Chinese options and really think that VIP may be the best Asian restaurant that I have been to in Madison.  On both visits I have been able to try many different items and a few items definitely stand out.  The cumin beef, seasoned with cumin of course and veggies is amazing!  I also tried the beef heel which is thinly sliced pieces in a chili sauce is also really great.  I have also loved the duck on both visits.  We also tried the fish, the exact type escapes me now but it is served scored with a chili sauce.  That dish was also very good.  Not only is the food good here though but the service as well.  Our waiter was very helpful and gave great recommendations.  VIP has a great drink menu as well.  I should also mention that this place is sort of deceiving from the outside.  I say that because upon walking in the atmosphere is that of a sort of upscale restaurant in a really big city.  This is a great place to host a large group or for date night.  My fiance and I were here a few days ago and we are really looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"A year and a half after my initial review and they're still getting their thumbs in my miso soup while serving it!"}
{"text":"Went here after skiing at Elver and it was incredible.  Only tried the crab rangoon and the hand-pulled noodles and both were very good, especially the hand pulled noodles. I ordered #1, the beef noodles, and it was delicious- the broth was very hearty and the beef was very tender. Nothing else terribly fancy in the soup besides some boll choy but it was perfect as is and will hit the spot on any cold day. Easily could have made two meals out of it; the portion was generous. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The dilemma of \"But I was here first!\"  Watched a table finish up and leave, have the table cleaned, reset, and then another table sit down. That new table got checked up on by two different waitresses before a single person came to ours. We had been here 30 minutes already. I realize that Saturday nights are busy, but randomly having servers attending all the tables around us while ignoring us is kind of frustrating. The food is good, but I don't know if I'd come back for this service."}
{"text":"Great sushi for the price and their All You Can Eat sushi on Sundays is an awesome deal. Their AYCE menu isn't just restricted to sushi but to appetizers (gyoza, shumai, edamame), salads, soups, and noodles as well.   FAIR WARNING: It says it on the AYCE menu but not everyone reads the non-food text, so please be aware that you cannot waste food or leave pieces of your order or else it will be charged as an ala carte. They limit it to 3 orders before you can get more to avoid this, but that doesn't mean you SHOULD get 3 items at once, especially if you know you get full easily. You can always order more. This should be common sense but a lot of people are used to buffets where you can waste so much food and not have to pay for it.   The decor and ambience is nice, and it's a great spot to go with your friends. I took off one star because service was excruciatingly slow on the Sunday we went, waiting close to 20-25 minutes per AYCE order my SO and I put in.   Also, please don't use your chopsticks as drumsticks because frankly it's rude and loud with everyone in quite close proximity of each other."}
{"text":"My sister, boyfriend and I came in and we're greeted right away and we noticed right away how dark the restaurant is. The menu consisted of sushi and Chinese cuisine which was a red flag because sushi isn't Chinese so it must not be authentic. We decided to order sushi anyway, my sister and I got rolls that can never go wrong, shrimp tempura, and my boyfriend got sashimi. The food arrived and the cooked rolls were okay. I tasted my boyfriend's sashimi and it was very chewy. We left pretty unhappy with what we paid for and what we got."}
{"text":"VIP is a part Japanese, part Chinese spot. I only got their sushi-sashimi lunch special and can't vouch for the rest of their food but  their sushi is legit- very fresh and good value for under $20! I will be back on future trips to Madison."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here at 3:15 or so on a Sunday and ordered the AYCE Sushi. We were able to do 3 rounds of sushi before calling it quits. It was about 15-20 minutes between orders, but we enjoyed the sushi. Our server, Eric, was really attentive. We tipped about 25% although we were there almost 2 hours, in hindsight, we should have tipped a little higher for how long we were there. We will definitely be back for their AYCE! I really enjoyed the volcano special roll. My husband really liked their sweet potato roll."}
{"text":"VIP has won me over! I have been there three times and each time it has been yummy. The crispy duck is my favorite! Sometimes the service is slow but I just don't visit if I'm in a hurry. I have been there once for a special occasion meal, dinner and then once for lunch. I also recommend the pork fried rice for lunch. It is a little dark in there for my taste but who cares when the food is so good!"}
{"text":"Looking for a new-to-me west side place to try when the sushi urge hit last night, I chose VIP due to all the positive Yelp ratings.   The setting isn't too impressive from the outside, but they did have festive blue holiday lights edging the eaves and coiled around the entryway columns. The peaceful blue lighting continues inside, in recessed fixtures that give the whole place a restful glow. There are interesting uses of color-changing lights throughout, and a wall-waterfall and koi pond with very friendly, inquisitive fish. I'm going to assume that they were just happy to see me, and not swimming over just to see if I had food for them. ;-)   I happened to arrive during their Monday-Wednesday sushi special pricing, so I was pleasantly surprised to see so many offerings of basic rolls at $3-4 each on the menu. The special rolls are also priced lower. I ordered the rainbow roll and one spicy tuna roll, and miso soup. I like to have tea with sushi, especially on a cold winter night, so I inquired about the 'flower tea' -- which flower? Jasmine? No. My very sweet waitress attempted to describe what the flower looks like, but that didn't shed much light on the topic. I ordered it anyway, and it was delightful. Almost clear in color, with a light floral sweetness. It was served at the perfect temperature, which allowed the delicate bouquet to blossom. I complimented the waitress on the tea and she knowledgeably described it as being the Chinese way to serve tea at a temperature meant to be cooling to the body when served with foods considered warming, such as many ingredients typically found in sushi. Loved it, and I'm guessing it was peony...maybe? It's a mystery. The tea is accompanied by a little bowl of rock sugar.  The miso soup was similar perfection, in temperature, flavor, just right.  On to the sushi. When it arrived, I was a bit taken aback at the spare appearance of it. There are no decorative sauces, garnishes, not much flourish or flair to the presentation. You get sushi, plus a small dab of wasabi and a small amount of ginger. The ginger is not the pink-dyed kind, which is nice. I'm not sure if the very basic appearance is typical of regular dinner priced rolls or not, but I will definitely go back and find out next time.  The $9 rainbow roll was absolutely fresh and delicious. Every ingredient stood out with great flavor. The pieces are smaller than I would typically expect from a special roll, but that kind of worked for me, as they were easier to eat in one bite. Sadly, the $3.50 or so spicy tuna roll was a complete waste of $3.50. It seemed to have been made so far in advance that everything had melded into a single gummy texture. The spicy tuna was processed basically to the point of being a paste, and the only other ingredient was what I would describe as scraped off breading from deep fried shrimp. I would recommend skipping the ultra cheap menu items for this reason.  The service was timely, warm and polite, very pleasant, and though I never got my requested water, the tea was so light and refreshing that I didn't really need it.  Four stars instead of five because of that unfortunate tuna roll. But I still think VIP is an excellent value with a very enjoyable atmosphere. I'm very much looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"This restaurant was on my radar for a while and I finally decided to give it a try. I should have went elsewhere. I was greeted right away and was surprised by the neon disco lighting everywhere. It felt a bit strange at noon lunch time. Seemed like it should be lighting for a bar only establishment or possibly a dance club. The server showed me to my seat and left me for a few minutes with the menu. I opted for the 3 roll lunch special with side salad (your choice of soup or salad on the side). The salad was swimming in dressing. I had to hold my fork of salad over the bowl to allow the dressing to run off it. It had about 10 times the amount of dressing that it needed. The rolls arrived next and looked ok on the plate. The shrimp in the shrimp tempura roll was really chewy and I was unable to even eat 2 pieces of the shrimp because it was inedible. The spicy salmon roll was very fishy tasting and it almost smelled 'bad'. I was super nervous that I was going to get sick from eating it. The actual star on the plate was the sweet potato tempura roll. This was amazing and the reason for 2 stars (it would be 1/2 stars without this roll).  I think the server forgot about me and I had to track her down for my check and to pay. There are WAY BETTER places in Madison for sushi."}
{"text":"After my recent visit to this restaurant, their stylish d√©cor and the consistent parade of beautifully plated dishes from the kitchen had me convinced that VIP stands for Visually Impressive Presentation. Despite a menu that rivals the unabridged version of \"War & Peace\" in girth, the food generally pleased my palette as much as it did my eyes.  While my dining party experienced some service hiccups, I definitely plan to return to VIP.  Since I showed up before the majority of our party of twelve arrived, one of the servers gave me a tour of the restaurant.  The massive sushi bar, bathed in blue light, immediately catches your eye as you enter the front door.  Also impressive is the elegant bar area, a perfect resting spot during your wait for a table.  There are numerous private dining areas scattered throughout the facility, including several intimate, traditional Japanese-style dining rooms, and several rooms geared to serve 8 to 10 dinners (including one table with a built-in lazy Susan to facilitate the sharing of menu items with your fellow tablemates).  While the setting is elegant enough to impress a date, I did not feel out of place wearing a t-shirt and shorts.  Pro tip:  If you are hopelessly indecisive about choosing an entree, go on-line and review the menu before visiting VIP.  We had to shoo away our server several times as members of our group mulled over the plethora of enticing options.  Speaking of the menu, there is something for everyone.  From traditional Chinese-American dishes like Kung Pao to the authentic (sliced pork ears or cow heels, anyone?), there is something for everyone (including a small kid's menu).  Prices are fair, factoring in the generous portion sizes.  Overall, our server did an admirable job with our table.  She helped advise the indecisive members our group, keenly monitored beverage levels and cleared the table of an armada of dirty serving plates as we munched through a never-ending array of appetizers and entrees.  The one area of frustration was the piecemeal delivery of the entrees - a good ten minutes elapsed between the delivery of the first set of entrees and the last.  Our server failed to notify us there would be such a long delay, so it created that awkward situation of trying to decide to dig in while the food was hot or be polite and wait for the delivery of all the entrees.  Bonus points for giving us the option of separate checks, very cool, VIP, very cool.  Overall, the quality of the food got high marks.  My appetizer, the beef negimaki ($7.50), was a delicious start to my meal.  The light sear on the beef intensified the flavor of the meat and the teriyaki sauce complimented, rather than overwhelmed the other flavors.  I also noticed how well the meat was trimmed, with no fat or gristle to detract from the texture.  My entr√©e, the special garlic spare ribs ($12.95), also impressed.  Deep-fried, but not greasy, the garlicky crunch of the exterior gave way to a moist, unctuous interior, especially the bone-in pieces.  I sampled over a dozen other dishes that night.  A couple of the standouts included the sliced beef maw in chili sauce appetizer and the delectable stir-fried beef with cumin powder.  The Lady Gaga roll was pretty in pink and visually stunning.  To my amazement, the fried ice cream also was excellent, infinitely better than the disastrous version I recently experienced at Casa del Sol (shudder).  A couple of the dishes fell flat.  The crispy duck was anything but.  The flabby skin would have benefited from more rendering of the underlying fat.  The fried string beans suffered from a copious dose of salt.  Overall, the good far outweighed the mediocre, especially considering the incredible breadth of the menu.  If you find yourself looking for a dining adventure on the culinary wasteland that is Madison's west side, a visit to this restaurant will have you feeling like a VIP."}
{"text":"I've had sushi all over the palce, East coast, west coast, midwest, and Japan. This place has sushi that is defintiely passable. I would even go as far as to say it's better than the 'fancy places' downtown that I have eaten at. The fish is fresh and is pleasing to both the eye and the palate. Many reviews cite poor service, however it appears that they have replaced the bad servers, as we eat here on a regular basis for lunch and have never had an issue, the servers during lunch are all fantastic. Portions are average, prices are affordable. The nice thing is that in addition to several types of sushi, they also have a full Chinese menu, so if you go with a group there is a large selection for folks who don't care for sushi. The decor is odd for a Chinese/sushi joint, feels more like a '50's themed Vegas night club."}
{"text":"Omg, yum. Pretty much just had sushi with the wife but everything was great if you like sushi rolls. Waitress was a bit hard to understand but very attentive and checked back often. Had a couple of bus boys running around and could not get my water less than 2/3 full without someone filling it. Place was clean and well decorated. Prices were cheaper than the Wausau/Stevens point area where I'm from. Will definitely be back.  One note. We were here early on a Thursday night and service was wonderful. I manage a restaurant and know how that can change when it gets busy, but blame management for that for understaffing."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group of fellow yelpers a few months ago, and I left very full and pretty impressed!  VIP has very nice decor, with a modern and clean feel that most Asian restaurants in the area lack. The service was really good, especially given that we had about 12 people at our table, with some arriving late or leaving early. We were given plenty of time to order, and nothing was forgotten.   Honestly, I thought I was going to be disappointed with the food. The menus (yes, multiple!) were huge, and there was one for sushi and one for pretty much everything else. We sampled many dishes from both menus, and the food was actually pretty tasty! Everything we tried was decent. A few dishes, such as the hand-pulled noodles, beef maw, pork dumplings in chili oil, and the cumin beef, were particularly delicious. For the amount of food we ordered, the price was reasonable, but I feel that if I just went with one or two other people it would be a bit expensive ($15 or more/person) for Chinese food.   I tried a mojito and was really surprised at how delicious it was! It was the right balance of sweet and tart, with a nice amount of mint. The waitress mentioned that they muddle the mint and limes fresh, and you could certainly tell. I was not expecting that from this type of restaurant. I learned later that they do have a bar/lounge area as well.  Overall, I recommend checking VIP out, especially for a larger group dinner."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate when policy overshadows the cooking. VIP is a classic example of when the chefs deliver fresh and delicious dishes but management interferes so greatly that it taints the entire experience.   I had the pleasure to experience the Sunday all you can eat sushi and the dishes I had the opportunity to enjoy were lovely. I wish I could end my review at that.   The restaurant has a policy that only allows patrons to order three dishes (sushi or non-sushi) at a time. But you cannot incrementally order as you finish a dish--all three must be finished before you are allowed to place another order. This policy forces diners to either eat quickly in order to sample the other items or choose a trio that offers variety at a piecemeal cadence.   This policy in theory is fine, it gives the kitchen breathing room. Fine. Except it takes 20 or more minutes for your next order to be brought to the table. 20 minutes. Regardless if you ordered a seaweed salad or a dragon roll. This is not an exaggeration by any means. There's a common theme among several of the reviews here and you've been forewarned.   To be fair, 20 minutes doesn't sound bad when you're waiting for a large 3-topping pizza but it's excruciatingly long in between orders of small plates. You know what I mean.   And again, if you choose to linger with your initial order and dine casually you cannot order any more food until every morsel has been consumed. Such is the policy. But the kicker is, there is ANOTHER policy that diners will be charged for any uneaten items. Totally fair and I personally hate a wasteful society so I can dig it. But the logic of restricting orders on the front end but then also penalizing diners on the back end is asinine. VIP's management at its finest.   And, if you happen to bring in a coupon for $5 off your meal, don't expect to use it on Sunday because it's the one day of the week where no coupons are accepted--which is obviously clearly marked on the coupon, right? Wrong. There are no date exclusions or exceptions on the coupon. Diners are made aware of this shabby policy on the bottom of a sandwich board by the hostess stand--the natural place for any promotional disclaimer, of course. Duh.   And the cherry on top, don't ask to see a manager because the manager is only on premise Friday and Saturday from 4-7pm. Totally normal. My bad for thinking a manager would ever be working beyond those critical weekend dining windows.   It's a learning experience at VIP!"}
{"text":"This is a place we'll frequent for their all you can eat sushi. The menu for it covers more than just sushi, you can also get a couple of different appetizers, soup, salad, and a few of their Chinese entrees.   I will say if you decide to go for the ayce be cautious of the fried rice. It's a ginourmous portion, and they will charge you if you can't finish it. Also be sure to clarify if you want sushi or sashimi. I always ask for sashimi and it inevitably shows up with rice.   The quality is good, and the selection is nice.   I've only been here for regular lunch once or twice, and generally feel that it doesn't set itself apart from other places well enough to cover the cost of what they serve to you."}
{"text":"I experienced two things here: terrible, terrible service and awesome, awesome sushi.   The inside is a mix of traditional and super hip and modern.   My friend and I came here in the middle of the day on a Saturday and it wasn't too packed.   The sushi is fresh, huge, and delicious.  The prices were pretty average.  Despite the \"service\", I would totally go back again!"}
{"text":"Joined a colleague here for lunch.  Don't let the outside fool you - it appears rather plain but when you walk in it's totally different in a good way.  Nice renovation of inside space but a bit dark when you first arrive.  I ordered the sashimi lunch which came with miso soup.  Food was fresh and tasted good - soup was classic. Waitress was friendly as well.  Overall a good experience but i would have to go back to see if other menu items would wow me. It is a fusion place with sushi and chinese (2 menus) with some cool stuff to try.  For now I will hold at 3 stars until I return for a more adventurous meal."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but a bit overly trendy.  The review that mentioned this place looks like the place that would attract the type with spray on tans nailed it.  That said... its not ghastly.  This place is the Jack of all trades for asian cuisine.  They had separate menus for Japanese food vs Chinese food.  Oh such a midwest thing.  We decided to stay on the Japanese side of things.  Sushi was good, but far from great.  The tuna I had was more fishy than I would like, but the Salmon was quite good.  I had the lunch special with the salad and it was alright.  Cohort had the sushi lunch and reported much the same about the fish.  But honestly what do you expect for Madison, WI.  Also had Edamame, soup and salad.  Those were just fine.  If someone suggests going there again I would return.  But I think I will keep exploring."}
{"text":"It is a nice place. I have been here a couple of times and just eat sushi which is nice. The seating is good and ambience is also good. I would recommend to read the menu on your own because sometimes the staff is new and they might not know how the dish is prepared. Otherwise the place is decent."}
{"text":"We always do the Japanese menu. Never let down by the foods. The waitress we had was awesome.  Everything is always fresh tasting, and comes to the table relatively quick. They are annexing with changing ingredients in rolls and sushi. Some places will not do this. VIP is always happy to do so."}
{"text":"Great hand crafted sushi.  A little pricey, but everything comes out looking clean and well presented.    We ordered the Volcano, Spider, and spicy crab.   Everything looks as pictured in the menu.    Staff is awesome.  Very attentive to the customers to ensure an error free event. Glasses are never empty, and staff checked back twice to ensure your food experience is exceeded.     The facility doesn't look like much from the outside, but a lot of attention did go with the interior.  Elegant modern theme with a small fish pond in the corner.    Over all experience was very well."}
{"text":"Came here for the all-you-can-eat sushi Sunday. The restaurant is beautiful. Food is ok. They make great special rolls, and I liked the spider, dragon and crunchy rolls the best. However, not as good for the regular rolls or sashimi or maki.  Now here's the huge complaint about their service. After we got a table and had our water. I asked if I could exchange for another plate, because there were so many broken edges on my plate. The waitress told us that there's no need to change because every plate is like that. And to our amazement, wow every plate is really as what she said.  After we placed our order, we waited 30 minutes to get our appetizer and other food. You can't order until you finish all your food, totally reasonable to avoid wasting food, but does it really take that long? We tried again a couple times, after we ordered, it does take 30 minutes for the next round of food.  At last, not to mention, there's an already added 18% tip on the bill, while none of us actually wanted to leave a tip.  Not coming back again!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The good news: the szechuan dishes we tried were very tasty.  Good ma po tofu and twice cooked pork.  The less good news: service is awkward and amateurish, the restaurant is cavernous and has an empty feel, and they're trying to do an awful lot, sushi and Chinese food and  drinks and dessert....It all winds up feeling a little muddled and careless.  The pot stickers we ordered were Japanese gyoza, the hot and sour soup was tasty but arrived barely lukewarm, and we were deluged with about six menus for different things.  My guess is that if they can dial back to doing fewer things well, they'll attract a loyal clientele."}
{"text":"VIP is one of the top restaurants that I frequently visit with my boyfriend and friends! As others have mentioned, although shabby looking on the outside, the interior design is dimly light but nicely decorated. My first impression of dining here was that it would be a neat place to take someone out for a first date!   With that said, VIP is also great for large gatherings of friends. I've celebrated my birthday here and just came here again for my boyfriend's birthday with a group of his friends. Both times, they played a happy birthday song over the loudspeakers for the entire restaurant to hear and then bought out a birthday treat! Then they take a Polaroid picture and display that at the entrance of the restaurant.   In terms of food, there's a good mix of Japanese and Chinese food so that you can order what you like depending on what you might be craving. On top of that, on Monday through Wednesday, there's a sushi special for half off on certain rolls or sushi when you dine in. I would recommend the Shrimp Tempura roll as it is crunchily delicious!   Overall, the service is decent, it can be slow at times as others have mentioned but it's not too bad either. The presentation and the taste of the food being served have always been delicious the many times that I've been here. I know for sure I'll be coming back again in the near future!"}
{"text":"Ok. So food is alright. But the service was horrible. We were here at 9 on Tuesday night. Waiteress never came to check, never brought out water.  Kept saying, we close at 10.   Would not go again."}
{"text":"VIP is great if you're looking for an economical meal and don't have high expectations. I've been for lunch and one of their \"sushi special\" nights.   Their lunch combos are decent and my favorite thing to get are the bento boxes: with those, you get salad, spring rolls, a California roll, rice, and terriyaki (vegetables or meat). It's the perfect portion, not too large but plenty to fill you up.   They also run a special where the sushi is half-price Monday-Wednesday nights for dinner. The rolls are somewhat limited, but it's still a great deal.   The food quality and service have always been average.   It's not my favorite place, but they have decent prices and the food is pretty good!"}
{"text":"4 for the sushi and 2 for the Chinese, 3 as a final score. Truthfully I would rate the place 4.5 if only sushi was served.  Since I am *real* Chinese born in China and living in China for the first 24 years of my life I could tell you the Chinese dishes served here is at best mediocre. However, the roll was truly good considering what you could have in Madison area.   Pros: the decor is modern, the room is spacious, decent sushi/roll, and the tables are sparse.   Cons: No real good tasting Chinese food.  Must try: VIP roll, Chef special roll.  Things to avoid: Fried rice, probably anything on the Chinese menu."}
{"text":"I have been to VIP a few times and really love Japanese food. I have tried other restaurants in Madison and though I thoroughly enjoyed them I was dismayed that they would charge extra for fried rice on a hibachi meal. VIP does not do this which I commend. The ginger sauce served with the hibachi is quite good and the food is always delicious. It is a shame that with such a large venue, they waste a lot of space with open floor plans and don't have a hibachi grill to cook my meal table-side. The show is almost the best part about hibachi. The one major downside is that I generally have terrible service while I am there. Language barrier is part of the problem, but also total inexperience and lack of knowledge. At one particular meal I had cold food delivered to me and completely inexcusable service. The manager never came over to me and I was only compensated for 10% of my bill. I don't normally look for deductions when service and food is poor, but a proper manager visit would have been appreciated. I haven't been back since, I might try them again in a few weeks if I can't get a seat at Takara or Ginza."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, I was skeptical. The outside looks like happy wok and anywhere that serves multiple cuisines is usually sketchy. However, I was blown away by the atmosphere and great service. We ordered Beef Brisket noodles, avocado roll, dragon roll, stir fried green beans (made a great appetizer for a group!) and dry chili chicken. Everything was so delicious and reasonable!! By far the best sushi I've had in Madison, and also the least expensive. The presentation was lovely, and although our dishes did not initially come to the table at the same time, the waitresses were gracious. A+!"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Atmosphere:   Awesome, clean and soothing.  Service:  Excellent.  We stuck to the sushi menu and thoroughly enjoyed each of the three types of rolls we ordered:  Spicy Yellowtail, Hell Fire Roll, and Sweet Heart Roll.  Each one was better than the last.  We relied on our server to recommend, and he accurately led us down the primrose path to culinary divinity.  Seriously.  Prices are definitely fair.  I wish I lived near VIP because I would most definitely sign on to becoming a regular.  The food coming out of the kitchen from the Chinese menu looked and smelled delightful, so I would probably have to try that next time (with a side order of one of those incredible rolls of course).    One teensy suggestion to management:  The squeaky wheels on the delivery carts either need oil or to be replaced by rubber wheels.  They were annoying."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch for sushi and have also ordered takeout. I would probably give the Chinese food a 3 and sushi a 3 1/2.  The take out Chinese food has been just ok. Everything seems overly spicy. But its not awful, I guess I just haven't found something I'm super excited about.  We have also gone for sushi for there half off sushi special. There spicy tuna and vegetable tempura were OK, I've had better but for the price not bad. The prices are really good for their regular rolls and simpler rolls. They do have discounts on their special rolls, a couple dollars off and those are pretty good. I husband likes getting beer with his sushi. I've tried their drinks a few times but they've always been on the sweeter side for me.  VIP has a nicer ambiance than you find at other places on the westside for sushi. If you dont want to drive downtown for fancier sushi then VIP might be for you."}
{"text":"I have additional thoughts on this place after giving in to my sushi craving last night. What I ordered was a sad excuse of a sushi roll. I didn't order a special one either. Actually, after re-reading my last review just now, I think I have the same thoughts. Thus, I would like to reiterate what I said in my last review.  No matter where I go for sushi, I always get Spicy Salmon. It shouldn't be hard to make. I finally got a picture of it, and it looks just about the same as mall sushi. Again, the fish was not fresh at all. This time, it was barely spicy. It was basically salmon pate.   In addition to my $1/piece sushi purchase, my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Yakisoba. Honestly, it was just oil and noodles. There was some chicken here and there, and barely any vegetables. I'm not even sure if the noodles were real soba. It just makes me sad that I really want to like this place, but I don't.  I think they need to step up their chef game. We called to get take out, and they said it would be done in 15 minutes. I expect a solid restaurant to spend more than that amount of time preparing my food. This statement is a lot coming from an impatient individual like me. I would give this place one star, but to be fair, the food was edible.  Note to self: Remember your past reviews and first impressions."}
{"text":"I traveled from Verona so I can try the sushi here and was a tad disappointed.  I ordered uni but of course they were out, so I ordered a couple regular rolls and a couple special rolls.  For what you pay for their special rolls, they were super small and definitely not worth the money.  The taste was great on all of the rolls, I just though that the special rolls were way overpriced.  All in all, with all of the sushi places in Madison, I won't be coming back to this one."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Their all you can eat on Sunday is a great idea for Sunday dinner. The sake menu is comprehensive and very well put together. The service is fantastic and sushi is absolutely delicious. Definitely awesome sushi in Madison!!"}
{"text":"Great little Japanese restaurant on the west side of Madison that also includes a Chinese menu. The decor was fresh and modern with neon lights lining the bar as well as a traditional flair mixed in by adding a bamboo covered wall and koi pod. I had 3 different vegan rolls and highly recommend the mixed vegetable one- I would have gotten them all mixed veggie had I known how good they would be! Our server was friendly and I truly appreciated her steering me away from a veggie noodle dish (she told me the \"broth\" was just water and had no flavor). I also got a Melon-Apple martini which was super good- other than the $10 price tag on the one drink. I recommend VIP for the service, the atmosphere and the well priced rolls. Will visit again but I would recommend adding \"vegan\" notes to menu items"}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the food, the ambiance, and the service!  We had a great time! Totally will recommend to anyone who likes to eat:)"}
{"text":"What a relief! A sushi place that has wooden chop sticks and hard table tops, rather than white table clothes waiting to get destroyed by fallen soy sauce and fried rice.   Definitely judge the exterior before entering, it only makes the interior all the better, that is once you find the hidden entrance.   Backstreet Boys and sushi seems so wrong, but it feels so right."}
{"text":"Best Vegan sushi in town. It's hard to outdo anyone for vegetarian sushi.  It usually all tastes the same and really is delicious and all, but VIP makes proooobably the best vegan sushi i've ever had.  They really put effort into their plant-based dishes."}
{"text":"The crispy duck is the best I've ever tried, highly recommend!! All other dishes are wonderful. I'll miss Madison for the crispy duck here."}
{"text":"The S.U. was out of town, it was cold and rather than wait for a table at the very crowded nearby pho joint, I took the opportunity to stick my nose into VIP. I had heard good things about the quality and they are, as far as I know, the only place in town to serve hand-pulled noodles.   For the uninitiated, hand-pulled noodles ROCK!! Not just fresh, not just hand-cut but hand-pulled. Some places let you watch the chef twist and throw, fold, twist and throw, fold twist and throw until the gluten firms up and you have long thin strands of chewy noodle. You can't watch at VIP (it ain't no noodle joint, ya know!), but it ain't no thing ...the texture is the thing.  They have several bowls with broth to choose from. I went simple. Beef. Plenty of noodles in a nicely flavored, rich broth with a bit of 5-star anise flavor and baby bok-choy. BOOM! Major success! No skimping on the noodles or vegetables. A perfect lunch on a cold day. Next time I'll do the duck.  Others have mentioned the decor. I was skeptical when I first walked in. It felt more at home on the 30th floor of a Tokyo tower than in a west-side Madison mall. Now that I've been there I'm glad it is. The Spousal Unit will love it."}
