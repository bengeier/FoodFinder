{"text":"Went with a group. Service was alright, although they mixed up a main order for one of my friends but he ended up liking the dish he got (cod) and they charged him for the cheaper dish he actually ordered (pork). I ordered the tortellini with rose sauce and my friend got the pesto penne. The food wasn't bad but we were both unimpressed (sauces were a bit bland and my pasta was a bit tough). The pasta tasted store bought and I felt I could have made it better at home. The portions were acceptable. My other friend got the manicotta and enjoyed it but his portion was rather small and he devoured it quickly. The restaurant is nice and has a good ambiance. It was full on a Saturday night. In summary, slightly below average service and food."}
{"text":"Delicious and consistent Italian restaurant. It's a nice and cozy mom and pop restaurant that serves quality dishes, many made in house. Came here with a couple girlfriends and the wait staff were so accommodating to us, especially to one girlfriend who had dietary restrictions. Service was quick, but not rushed and I enjoyed my meal very much, lasagna with meat sauce perfectly made. The portions are fair, but not too big. I still had enough leftovers to take home for lunch the next day:) Definitely recommend to diners looking for a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"My whole family just loves Ricardo's.  

While there, you will a wonderful meal (at a great price) and feel like you are sitting right at Mama's kitchen table.  The staff make you feel so at home.  You'll want to go back every evening.  I once ate there three time in one week!"}
{"text":"Came back after a long time since the last visit. Restaurant has been redecorated and acoustics are much much better. Food is great as always."}
{"text":"Good family restaurant just at the end of the DDO restaurant district ;)   Friendly staff and good food at decent prices."}
{"text":"Working in the West Island doesn't have many perks. Riccardos is one of the few perks that St. Jean has to offer. I've been going here for about 6 years and I must stay I love everything about it.

They recently renovated making the small area appear and feel larger but they haven't lost their family style touch. The waiters and waitresses treat you like family, the food is home made and cooked to order.

You can't go wrong here. My only complaint about this location is that the bread is always served warm and paired with really cold butter. You just can't do that. Room temperature butter would be a better option...but if that is your biggest complaint then I guess this place comes up on top!"}
{"text":"We know their restaurant food has been good so we ordered their catering food with high hopes. Turned out they took a safer path. The price wasn't cheap nor too high. It's within white folks food range. It was fresh and safe but the flavour wasn't there. I think they're learning the catering slippery slope. They eventually get better as most caterers always do but for now it's so so. We have fate in you Ric don't give up!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered Pizza and it was very good, my friends ordered pasta and they were very satisfied. customer service was good and price reasonable $14 for a classic pizza."}
{"text":"This is the second time I'm here and again, it absolutely kicked @ss. The lemon shrimp was ridiculously good and the lemon veal almost as good. Service was almost too fast, they had great suggestions and I am extremely happy. 
Second visit was a Friday night, mostly empty. First was a Saturday, full house."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and service ! Would recommend and will go back anytime! One of the best places in the West Island to get home made gnocchis ! Good for groups (but reserve in advance) or a date."}
{"text":"What can I say - been hearing about this place for a few years decided to go and it did not live up to the local reputation that's for sure.

The place was jammed packed - I can't imagine why - Close by and cheep I guess.

First the decor - dated, dark and depressing, stucco and vines, yuck. 

After we were seated we were brought a stale basket of rolls - dry and hard  and must have been sitting in the freezer and then the counter for quite a while.  We had the house wine - not great - but I'll take the blame - should have known better.  I split an order of calamari with my husband who agreed they must have been shipped in from the Michelin factory - rubbery, obviously pre-frozen and the coating was flaking off.  The tomato sauce served with was a little bland.  

I ordered the spaghettini with Puttanesca sauce - the pasta was overcooked - which incidentally is supposed to be their thing, oops. And the sauce, not horrible but not the greatest either. My husband ordered some cream sauce thingy, which he said was so-so.

The service was friendly. Maybe I caught them on an off night. Can't see myself returning in the near future."}
{"text":"We were four, we were all pleased with our choices, excellent very attentive service, quality food. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Riccardos est un très bon italien à DDO.  Il y a plusieurs italiens à proximité mais celui ci est un des meilleurs.  Le choix de pâtes et sauces est plutot traditionnel mais savoureux, épices bien dosés, pas trop salé (le défaut que je trouve à trop de restos italiens).  Essayez aussi les pizzas, excellentes!"}
{"text":"Very lovely restaurant. Food is delicious, good portions, not expensive and pretty fast. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Though the restaurant is tucked away in the more residential part of St. Jean's, there's nothing low key about the food being prepared at Riccardo's. Recipes perfected over time in nonna's kitchen - something that's way too hard to find in the West Island

PROs
- Homemade options are LEGIT (restos too often jerk you around with \"homemade\" pastas)
- Nice decor (newly renovated to make the small location feel roomier)
- My pizza was super tasty without being greasy. Stuffed myself silly
- Pricing is fair considering the food quality

CONs
- I waited a bit more than I would've liked but considering it was peak hours, resto was packed & everything else was perfect, I've forgiven it for the overall score

Notes:
- Awesome place for an intimate date
- Dining at the bar seemed like a nice option for people dining alone or in a hurry"}
{"text":"My family had previously been to this restaurant two to three years ago, and they said that is was pretty good. The evening that I went to this restaurant it was close to minus 27 degrees outside and it was still busy none the less.
 The decor and overall appearance of the restaurant was alright, nothing special...a little dark.

The menu was a typical Italian type - appetizers, salad, pasta, pizza, entrees. I choose to go with the Napolitana pizza. Now before I ordered this I had a pretty good idea what a good Italian pizza should taste and look like as I've traveled to Italy and had great pizza. I've also had great pizza around Montreal. This has to be on my bottom 3 in terms of pizza from an Italian restaurant, the dough was mediocre and the pizza was extremely oily. I was expecting some nice pieces of mozzarella and tomatoes and what I got was a regular cheese pizza. Not only was I disappointed with that, but it was very small for a personal pizza. 

Overall the restaurant aesthetically looks nice, but I was not impressed with the food.

Now the one thing that my family left out was that the restaurant makes their own gnocchi and that its pretty good. Had I known that I probably would have ordered that, you can never go wrong with homemade gnocchi!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is amazing, we were very impressed. And finally a place that makes an Arrabiata that is actually spicy :) Thumbs way up!"}
