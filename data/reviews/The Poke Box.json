{"text":"Superb quality of ingredients and amazing mix of sauces which come both light or creamy. I have tried the zucchini pasta which is a light alternative to the equally yummy sushi rice. I also find their salmon extremely fresh :) nom best thing is, it's a very filling bowl"}
{"text":"Super delicious and filling boxes! Great for a healthy lunch. Fireball poke is my go-to!"}
{"text":"Admittedly, I'm a Poke Box addict. I go here at least once a week and the super friendly staff now knows my order. It's great that I can walk in and smile and watch as the soft sushi rice base is thrown into its brown cardboard chalice. It's followed with a delicate yet necessary spray of seaweed flakes before being passed down the proverbial Pokessembly Line where two generous clumps of red and white crab salad are lowered into the lair. Then the magic happens. Cucumber, edamame, onions, and jalapeños accompany soft and succulent morsels of salmon sashimi as a waterfall of spicy mayo and unagi sauce drowns the ingredients in a marriage of culinary delights. The mixture is gently spooned into the box and topped with an optional drizzle of unagi essence. Now at the end of the line, crispy fried shallots and wasabi peas dust the box, as if to place the cherry on what would have already been a perfect sundae."}
{"text":"Great food and fast service! Was visiting Toronto for the weekend and found this little gem. Wish there are more shops like this in the US."}
{"text":"Amazing. Best sushi I've had ever.  Loved doing half rice half Zucchini   Tuna was amazing."}
{"text":"Nice decor. Great location. Packed even on a rainy day. Tried the original Poke Box. Ingredients are fresh. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Having tried every poke place in Toronto now, I'd say this one is pretty close to the top.  Price range is very similar to the other ones in downtown Toronto. Portion size is generous. Always a line if you go during the lunch hour. Only 3 stools to sit.  Things this place has that other poke places doesn't:  Zucchini noodles as the base instead of rice (I personally prefer half rice half zucchini). On days when you don't want to feel stuffed for hours on end, it's a great option. Some toppings which are considered premium or cost extra at other poke places are included here eg crab slaw, seaweed salad"}
{"text":"One of the best poke spots in Toronto. Fresh protein and amazing quality toppings is what you can expect. The staff is very knowledgable and also wasn't afraid to give extra toppings when asked. I would definitely come back here again and tell all my family about this experience. Great job."}
{"text":"Love this poke box. Had the signature poke box which had a generous amount of salmon and tuna with pineapple,edamame, and some additional salads. I chose half purple rice and half zucchini noodles. I chose the ponzu sauce and fish roe. They did not have the wasabi peas however even though I requested this. I think I picked the kale salad and seaweed. Overall it was a delicious meal. I ordered through Ritual otherwise the lineup was huge! You also get a few dollars off on your first Ritual order so I highly recommend using the app."}
{"text":"Solid food. Price is a little on the higher side, but quantity is better than some other places' (like Calii love.....). They gave a good portion of fish and other sides."}
{"text":"Will not order again. Asked for hot sauce and stated there wasn't any even though it's right there on the side. The portions are really small"}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 3.5 stars...don't think they fully deserve the 4th.  Not bad but not amazing.  Fresh ingredients and interesting flavours.  I did really enjoy it.  Cons: Limiting menu and a bit pricey for the size.  I ordered a large and to be honest it is my first time there and if it was a large, that was disappointing.  I am full but just barely."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times in total and I never really had a satisfying experience. Food quality is a hit or miss. The first time I ordered sushi rice it was hard and had to throw away half of it. The fish is good, sometimes it tastes rubbery. The veggies are usually pretty fresh. The price is a bit steep for a reg box around $13.   The problem I have most is the service. I find that they're not helpful at all. The place is small and when there's a line up, you can tell it gets overwhelming for them. I think if they have a list of their items like what sauces they have or toppings in front of you while they're preparing the box, it will make service much more efficient."}
{"text":"Ordered the spice salmon box with brown rice for lunch. Service was amazing. The only draw back is that the space is on the smaller side. Nonetheless this is a healthy little gem in the heart of the financial district!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious poke bowl last night before the leafs game with my nephew.  He had his first poke bowl and loved it!  I had the tuna/salmon mix and it was so fresh, loved every bite.  This place is one of my fave poke spots in Toronto and if I'm ever in the neighbourhood, I try and hit it up.  The staff is super nice and accommodating.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Feeling indulgent, but want something fresh and full of colour? This is it! I have spent way too much money here, but it's been worth every penny. Don't be fooled by the different sizes. The smaller size is more than enough food for one person. My go to is the Spicy Box. You can make your own too with their large selection of toppings. If you like sushi, you'll love poke!"}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely be back for more!  I ordered the large poke box and I could not finish it.  I've been to other poke places and the bowls we're extremely small and did not fill me up. So for almost the same price at other places, I got my money's worth of poke!  The bowl was beautifully crafted and all the items went very well with each other.  There was plenty of salmon and tuna and loved that they added tiny square pieces of pineapples. Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I've had my first Poké from Pusateri's and then I come upon this while walking to the gym close by and my whole life has changed. BEST POKÉ ever. Best food, great vibes and music. I'm obsessed with their Poké!!  I usually make my own Poké box because I'm quite picky but everything is so fresh and so worth the price. Also, I get the regular size, because I think it's a pretty good size. This is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The rice, the fish, the ingredients in general are all absolutely delicious and fresh - best poke in fin district"}
{"text":"My first time trying poke.  I have their special of the day \"wasabi kick\".  It has salmon, clams, seaweed salad, corn, cucumber, pineapple, avocado, and of course wasabi with sushi rice and zucchini as base.  It is soooooo yummy, the whole combination is very fresh, tasty, crunchy, sweetness (fr corn) and of course lots of heat.  I love it and the regular size is just perfect.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Day 3 of Poké Week and their box was quite enjoyable.  But before I get into that, I just wanted to mention the great vibe this place had.  The place is just a few weeks old so the staff had that wonderful enthusiasm that I hope doesn't wither as they establish themselves.  Keep it up, team!  We were given a customized box that consisted of salmon, seaweed salad, crab salad, edamame, pineapple, zucchini noodles, crispy ramen, crispy onions, house sauce, spicy mayo, sesame seeds and sushi rice.  You may have just read that and thought, \"Wow! Look at all those ingredients!\".  Now here's what I have to personally say about this: dis tew much.  Mind you, I loved the house sauce and the crunchy ramen but again, it was too much.  There was way too much going on.  With all that's going on, you would think that they would have some avocado in there which is a key ingredient in a poké bowl, or in their case, a box.  With all the ingredients, the amount of fish was also not as generous as I had hoped especially compared to previous poké spots.  If I had to pay full price for the amount of fresh fish, I would've been a little disappointed.    If I may, I'd recommend cutting down on the extra ingredients such as edamame, pineapple and zucchini noodles or at least instead of the noodles, present it in small cubes. Also, please throw some avocados in there. If you're going to skimp out on the fish, the avocados will at least add some of the buttery texture and flavour to the dish.  It would also probably go great with your house sauce.    I'd rate the box itself 3/5 but overall rating a 4/5 as I'd still like to be considerate of their warm hospitality and also the presentation."}
{"text":"Ever since trying Poke for the first time in Seattle, I was hooked! All the poke places I have tried in Seattle had bold flavors, and offered generous portion sizes. So, when I tried Poke again in Toronto (at a different location), I was rather disappointed by the stingy portion size and high price point. Since then, I have been on the hunt for good Poke. Now behold the Poke Box, it offers fresh bold flavors with generous serving size. This place is in the Financial District, making it very convenient for everyone working downtown. The décor of Poke box is minimalist and clean. Poke Box offers two sizes to choose from, regular and large. I picked the classic salmon on half rice half zucchini noodles, along with other fresh toppings. One thing that makes them stand out is the fact that they offer zucchini noodles as a base if you are on a low carb diet. All the ingredients in the box were fresh and flavorful. I am very happy to have found Poke Box. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I love their zucchini noodles :)   This is a great poke spot if you're looking for something fast and not super expensive. Portions are good, ingredients are fresh and tasty, and they don't skimp! It's definitely a take-out place though, since they have literally only 4 stools squished together at a long table. On the other hand, this means that you can grab your food and get out extremely quickly (in the times I've went at around 1pm, there was no line). Staff are nice and efficient; everything is well organized. Would come here for my regular poke fixes :)"}
{"text":"For awhile, I was addicted to the Spicy Salmon box on half zucchini noodles / half mixed grains, which was awesome because it was both tasty and not too carb-laden. Decent portions, choose-your-own toppings, pick your sauce: What's not to like?  Crispy shallots are always a welcome addition, and I'd never turn down a scoop or two of tobiko.  The Szechuan peppercorn sauce is the stuff of addiction.  EDITED: I had previously mentioned about the night I bought a box for lunch the next day. The owner has kindly reached out to me to explain that the marinade includes pineapple juice, which breaks down the enzymes of the fish. Totally explains why the fish had become a mushy texture the next day, it was never meant for next-day consumption - it's best eaten upon purchase only. Not a problem for me, I'm happy to get Pokebox anytime!"}
{"text":"Yes. Yes yes yes yes yes.   I've ordered the large spicy box a couple of times off of Ritual. Yes it's expensive but if I show some self-control (and I pick the more filling sushi rice option) I can eat half of it as a small lunch, and then have the rest as an afternoon snack. Good amount of fish. Ordering off Ritual is a breeze - it's always available for pick up at the side of the counter. A few spaces at counter seating - definitely more of a take out place."}
{"text":"So this was my first Poke experience and I must say, I'm very impressed!  Place had a steady stream of people but you're not waiting long as they've mastered their assembly-line procedure. However, this place is more of a take-out place as there is very limited seating and due to the heavy foot traffic, can feel quite cramped.  I ordered the regular size Spicy Box for lunch on a workday. 1/2 purple rice, half zuchini noodle base as people here suggested and both seaweed and crab salad. Don't worry about the spice level. It's just some wasabi peas and spicy mayo.   Now I'm an avid meat eater/lover and usually leery of \"healthy\" and meatless alternatives but damn that was good. Everything tasted fresh and the combination of ingredients was delicious. And thank god I ordered regular (and not large) because I was feeling full until 8pm as Poke Box gives you a very generous serving! But with such a yummy and filling box, the slightly expensive price tag (like $13 with tax?) might make you hesistate. Don't worry, it's totally worth it! Some of my friends are already regular customers lol.  I would definitely come back. Looking forward to trying new flavours :)"}
{"text":"It was good, but pricey. I do love their different base options. I got the zucchini noodles, which were very good. The poke was good, but wish there was more of it. They were generous with everything else."}
{"text":"Tried Poke Box on a week night for a quick dinner before going to an event. This is one of the many poke competitors available in Toronto as it's the current trend and is filling and delicious as well.   Food (3/5) All the boxes are made to order and you can choose either their signature boxes with preset items or an option to build your own box. I chose the DIY route and opted for salmon over the grain blend. The salmon wasn't of supreme quality but I didn't expect it to be. The grain blend was a purple rice but there are other options such as sushi rice, zucchini, etc. I chose the crab salad and seaweed salad but was disappointed by the saltiness of both. To top off, the staff recommended a mix of the sweet garlic soy and citrus ponzu. The sauces were both subtle so it's hard to comment on whether it's necessary or not.  Service (3/5) There really isn't much to write about as this is a 'fast food' option. The girls working were both very patient and were ready to offer suggestions as it was my first time trying this place. They were quick to acknowledge each customer and service was quick and efficient.  All in all Poke Box was not a standout compared to all the other poke options around town. My favourite at the moment will still be Ono Poke by Exhibition."}
{"text":"Tried a few poke places, and this place is SUPERB! Excellent service, super clean, minimalistic decor, and tons of options!  If you already love sushi, you'd LOVE this place! With a huge range of healthy, seafood, vegetarian, and gluten-free options, you can customize your own poke box. All of their ingredients are super fresh, healthy, and delicious! Almost like deconstructed sushi in a box!  I ordered a regular box ($11.50) with: sushi rice, edamame beans, seaweed salad, avocado, and tuna. It lived up to expectations! So flavourful, well-seasoned, and filling! You can tell the ingredients like the Hawaiian tuna was extremely fresh!  Moreover, the staff were super friendly and professional.   Can't wait to come back here! Worth the price!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! It is essentially sushi in a bowl. They have pre-designed boxes or you can make your own (sort of like making a Chipotle burrito bowl). I had the Superfood Box with grains as the base. This bowl came with salmon (big chucks!), avocado, seaweed salad, edamame, beets and kale. It was hands down one of the best lunches I've had. You can create your own with sushi rice, grain, spring mix or zucchini noodles, so you have some healthy choices. The only sad thing is that I'm not from Toronto :( I need to try more!"}
{"text":"Ingredients are very fresh and service is very fast. The bowl itself was so flavorful and filling. Will definitely be back. They have a Spicy Box that sounds delicious!!  9/20/17 - Guess who's back?? Employees were super patient and helpful. Ingredients are still super fresh and the box I chose this time (Poke Box - $11.50 USD) was delicious. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"[UberEats Review]  While I cannot speak for the in-person type of orders, I was kind of disappointed with the box I received. I had ordered the signature poke with extra salmon and my order came with salmon (perhaps there was extra of it) but it seemed like they forgot the tuna. For someone that loves poke and food, this brought incredible sadness to me- no kidding.   Ignoring my (arguably) dramatic reaction to my lack of tuna (although I still am insulted and bitter), I thought the overall quality of the food was wonderful. I was very impressed with the grain mix (it was the purple rice) because it had the sushi vinegar in it. A lot of places that offer non-sushi rice often don't include the sushi vinegar on the rice so that was a pleasant surprise.   Had it not been for my lack of tuna (i'm repeating it the third time here- you see now how much it bothered me right?), I would go again. But i don't think my heart is ready to experience another tuna-less signature poke so maybe I'll pass on visiting here again and go for somewhere else- or maybe I'll come in-person.   We'll see. Food was 4.5/5. Overall feeling was 3/5 because again, lack of tuna. I swear I'm not obsessed with tuna, I just wanted a variety of fish in my bowl."}
{"text":"Poke Box hasn't spent much on decor, with a hyper-minimalist white walls and no seating. The space is a little reminiscent of that time when I thought I could DIY all my home decor (I was wrong).  Pricing is on par with the others; a small is $11.5, and a large $13. The small looks tiny,  but don't be fooled, it's more filling than it looks!  The Poke Box offers more creative options than its competitors, with zucchini noodles as an option for the base, and finishing touches such as crunchy ramen, fried onions, and coconut. It won't blow your mind, but is definitely one of the better downtown options."}
{"text":"Poke! The Poke box brings me my first poke experience and I enjoyed it a lot. I ordered the large Poke box (Tuna + Salmon) for $16 which came with tropical slaw, seaweed salad, crab salad, cucumber, edamame, red onion, roasted sesame, ginger and furikake. For the base, I did half sushi rice and half grain blend. Boy did they fill up the box with fresh goodies and I added spicy mayo to top it off. Also, definitely check-in here so you can get the check-in offer of free avocado on your box!  The decor is simple as they showcase their avocados in the crates by the door. Seating is extremely limited as they have three bar stools. I came at an off hour so I could find a spot to sit at.  Now to the Poke Box. Everything blended very well together. I was a fan of the grain blend which is a more healthier option. The large is quite big as they stuff a lot of ingredients in the box. I was super full after eating so much!   After this experience, I am a Poke fan and want more poke!"}
{"text":"Always packed during lunch, and for good reason! Fresh ingredients and decent portions, it will fill you up with healthy and tasty poke. Regular size range from $11-$14 and large sizes range from $14-17 but the small is more than enough for me. All of the boxes I've tried were good, but the Cali Unrolled Box which contains mango was too sweet and felt more like dessert which I wasn't a fan of. Ordering ahead (Ritual) or using a delivery app (UberEats) during peak time is recommended unless you like waiting inside a small building with dozens of other people."}
{"text":"I think one of the biggest crimes is butchering the rice. I feel that rice is the most fundamental things you should get right. I've been to a few poke places already and this seems to always be an issue. I had the same problem with pokito as well. The rice was oddly hard in some areas and melted at others. This made it very difficult to eat as I was essentially just eating sashimi at this point.  Service is understandably slow as they just opened which is fine. I think they will eventually have it optimized.   The fish itself is decent. The flavors didnt blow my mind or anything but they weren't too bad either. Everything felt very generic. I really do think there is a lot of room for improvement in terms of the overall experience. I would give the poke 3 stars at best if the rice was well made. I am still hoping to find a poke place that will live up to expectations."}
{"text":"Umm hello Zucchini noodles. The one thing I missed after going low-carb was rice.. and poke bowls. I've tried it with salad in some places but its just not the same. But then my husband told me about this joint close to his work. The zooooooooooodles make your bowl even healthier. The sauces are great and so is the topping selection. Its a small place and you'll see most people use Ritual to pre order.  I've literally seen a lineup outside the dooe during lunch time; so that should be a testatement. If you work anywhere close to FiDi; definitely grab lunch here!"}
{"text":"One of the best Poke boxes I've had next to Hawaii. Fast efficient service. Line was out the door but moved quickly.  They cater to dietary restrictions and know exactly what has what. (Gluten & Dairy free was no problem) next time I'm getting double fish. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Best Poke I've had in Toronto by far. This place definitely gives you value for your money and is in consistent rotation on my dinner menu for late nights at the office.  Ingredients are always fresh and plentiful. My absolute favourite."}
{"text":"I LOVE COMING HERE FOR LUNCH.   Each box is so filling and the salmon is always super fresh. I've tried other poke places before, but this joint always seems to have the edge because of the price and freshness. Usually poke boxes go over $15, but I find the price for the Poke Box to be unbeatable. Also, the ingredients are so FRESH!! (Seriously cannot stress how fresh they are.)  I usually get the Super Food or the Spicy Box. You can also build your box, but I don't think there's too much of a difference in terms of price? (I've never built my own box before). I like to top off my boxes with extra crispy onions, oh yeah.   The only thing issue I find with the Poke Box is that their order time for Ritual is very inconsistent. Sometimes, it seems faster to order in person than to order through Ritual because there's only 1 girl managing the order or something (not too entirely sure how they handle Rituals). Other times, my food is ready super fast.   Either way, I'm always happy eating from this place.    TLDR; The wait time for Ritual is wonky, but it's not pricey and super fresh and delicious. Definitely check out The Poke Box if you work around the area!"}
{"text":"Super yum! I've been having trouble finding good Poke in town in this place was just perfect. I came at the end of the day when they were almost out of salmon so they made my Spicy Box with a salmon/tuna combo. Add to that a zucchini noodle & rice blend base, plus a free avocado topping from Yelp and I was in heaven. I was starving and there was definitely enough food in the regular size to fill my appetite. Really nice staff too. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Here a few times for lunch. It's a nice little place tucked right in the core of Financial District.   The staff is very fast and very friendly. These guys make Poke in convenient boxes, unlike other places that put theirs in plastic bowls. The boxes can be stored easier and eaten later.  You can customize what goes into the boxes. Prices I guess is moderately high, but reasonable for the area and the amount of food they pack in the boxes.  Only preferable thing I might want is maybe a few more chairs to sit at the counter. Understandable that is it a take out only though."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best places I've had for poke. The portions are large, super filling, the fish is fresh and tasty and most importantly, the rice is soft! If you have read any of my previous reviews for other places, you would know i've been to some where the rice was rock hard so this was a plus. Pricing is reasonable as well =)   The staff are nice and the lines do move fairly quickly. The place isn't big though so just be prepared for a line up inside."}
{"text":"Clean eating, one of my go-to options for lunch or a quick dinner in the financial core! I usually get half sushi rice half zoodles with the classic salmon and spicy mayo combo. You can ask for light on the sauce."}
{"text":"Quick, fast and fresh. I wasn't expecting the lack of seating or the really small restaurant - it's more of a dive but, damn, it's good. I created my own bowl; they have signature bowls with combinations and they all sounded delicious as well. Everything I ordered tasted very fresh with a beautifully balanced flavour due to their sauces."}
{"text":"Brightly lit room. Minimal decor. White walls all over.  Some interesting options, such as zucchini noodles. Haven't had a noodle base before.  Tuna, Salmon, and Tofu for your proteins, along with some \"daily special\" options.  They've got your salad toppings, variety of sauces, and garnishes to finish it off. Wasabi peas and seaweed salad to name a few options I enjoyed.  You get everything packed into a box, as the name suggests.  Disposable chopsticks, forks, and spoons are available on the side. Chopsticks are not inside packages."}
{"text":"Love that this place has zucchini noodles as an option for a base! Poke is fresh and dressed with the right amount of sauce. I've always tried the DIY version and it always hits my poke craving. While this is one of the more expensive lunch options downtown, the portion is very filling (especially if you order it with sushi rice)."}
{"text":"A bit on a pricey side, but the portions are pretty big. The regular will easily feed one person for a meal (the rice is quite heavy).  The fish pieces are big and fresh - my fav is the salmon. I think it's better than the tuna they have, which costs even more.   Avocado is an extra $1.50 though, which I found was a bit on the expensive side.   If you're a yelp member, remember to check in! They have a lot of offers, from 20% off to free avocado."}
{"text":"4/5  Maybe I've just been really into Poke bowls/boxes lately but this was quite good. Visited on a Friday night, around 6:30 pm. It was just before closing so it was pretty quiet (one person was just finished when we arrived) and being located on a small street, this is somewhat of a hidden spot.  Ordered the large super food box with salmon. The servers are friendly when asking your choice of base and the additional toppings (got some wasabi peas and seaweed). Since there was no one else there, me and my friend decided to sit in, although with 4 seats total it is mainly a takeout spot. Overall, the box was light and fresh, with the salmon, avocado, and seaweed salad being the standouts for me. The rice was not too sticky and I was decently full by the end of it.  The thing that is stopping me from giving a higher rating is the price point - at 15.50 for the large super foods box, it is on the high side and compared to my friend who got a regular size (12.00) , not quite worth the price premium. Still a nice option if you're looking for a quick poke option with quality ingredients."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today and it won't be my last. All the ingredients were super fresh, and everything also tastes great! I got the regular sized bowl and it's more than enough for 1 person- reasonably priced for that much food. I asked for a suggestion of sauces at the counter and the gentlemen at the counter was very nice and the combination turned out great!"}
{"text":"I went to their grand opening when they had their BOGO promotion, and I really enjoyed my poke experience! Ingredients were high quality, fresh and delicious. I had the Build Your Own Box poke and my friend got the Spicy Box. I like how they package the meal into a box so it's a great grab and go takeout type of meal. Healthy food for dinner, yay!"}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch one friday afternoon. Not busy at all if you went around 2 pm. I've had this craving for a poke bowl after going to su&bu last week. Walked in to see that they have their standard 6 bowls plus 2 specials of the day. (spicy tuna and rainbow bowl)... unfortunately their specials sell out quick so if you go later you will only get one of their regular bowls.  I opted to try the poke box which is the classic salmon and tuna with the different mixings. The great thing about Poke Box is they have different selection for you to choose as your base. Rice, grain rice (which i believe is purple and brown rice) and zucchini noodle. I have never seen a poke place with zucchini noodles and was definitely intrigued so I had that one! They start off with placing the zucchini noodles at the bottom then they start mixing the salmon, tuna, edamamas, onion and mango in a seperate bowl with soya sauce and spicy salmon sauce (as you desire). It is then lined up ontop of the zucchini and topped off with some crab salad, seaweed salad, paper thin seaweed and some fried onions. Quite tasty and has such a refreshing taste when you go with the zucchini noodle option! It is a little bit on the pricier side. Small is about $13 and large is about $16. But the size, quality of ingredient and freshness truly trumps the price.  Will definitely return to try some specials when I'm having this poke craving again!"}
{"text":"First time here. Picked Poké box which has salmon & tuna. It was good. I'll go there again."}
{"text":"This place probably makes the best poke bowls in Toronto and I always come here whenever I'm craving poke!!! Tried a poke bowl for the first time from The Poke Guys and wasn't that big of a fan. The portions there were pretty small and I even then, I couldn't finish it because I got tired of it. I decided to give poke bowls another try with my sister at The Poke Box and I absolutely loved it. I always order the small spicy box with half sushi rice and half zucchini noodles (sooo good). Also, if you check in on yelp you get free avocado with your bowl which is always a plus!!"}
{"text":"Kudos to these guys! you can tell they are really careful with their work, the presentation and quality of the sashimi. The freshness of the salmon was what really made poke box stand out. They also use a very interesting combination of flavors and sauces that are definitely worth trying, I can't remember exactly what I had except for the edamame, nori flakes, seaweed that all complemented the flavour of the salmon and rice very well. The size might be smaller than competitors but the quality really makes up for it  - definitely give Poke Box a try."}
{"text":"I've tried quite a few poke places but hands down The Poke Box is one of my top favourites. They use the freshest ingredients here and the flavour combinations are amazing. Their Poke Signature Box is my favourite - it comes it with salmon, tuna, tropical slaw, seaweed salad, crab salad, cucumber, edamame, red onions, ginger, furikake, and roasted sesame seed. The tropical slaw gives this box a great freshing  and sweetness - reminds me just of summer!  I've also tried their Spicy Signature Box. It definitely does has a spicy kick to it. Maybe I can't handle spice as well so it was a struggle to finish but still nevertheless delicious! They also have an option for you to customize your own bowls as well. Will certainly be back soon!"}
{"text":"Yum! Loved their grated zucchini noodles as a base. Have been there twice now and both times have really been blown away by the flavours. A tad bit pricey for how much you get but with the options you get to choose from and the deliciousness of the poke I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Great taste. The sashimi are really fresh and the portions are huge! Various flavours and daily specials to suit your taste bud. It's a little far for me but I try to go whenever I am in the area."}
{"text":"Super!  I was a fan of northern poke but this is my new poke place!  The toppings are great and staff super friendly"}
{"text":"A bit hard to find (tucked in the back of a building) but this is a delight. Great quality poke!"}
{"text":"Was visiting the Hockey Hall of Fame and looking for something healthy to eat. Found the reviews and this place was a short walk away. It did not disappoint! Friendly staff, fresh/delicious food. Fortunately for us the weather was dismal so there weren't many people there around 1pm and we were able to snag the 4 counter stools, which is all there is for seating.  There's a regular and a large box. The regular is enough to feed an adult and the large was enough to share between an adult and 10-year old. We ordered a Maui box and 2 custom boxes. There are plenty of choices for your custom meal that I can't imagine someone not being able to find something they like. The only thing we weren't sure of was the sauce but they give you a taste of it if you ask - we liked the garlic soy! The fish was cold and fresh, the vegetables were nice and crisp, and it was all around delicious. Been to another poke place in a major US city famous for its seafood and this place was much, much better. Don't forget to check-in on Yelp to get a FREE topping of avocado! YUM!"}
{"text":"I have a huge poke obsession and have been to every place in the city so was very excited for a place to open a short walking distance from work. Unfortunately I was disappointed. Although service was friendly and staff was wonderful. I felt the sushi rice missed the mark. It felt like it was lacking in vinegar perhaps."}
{"text":"This is a go to for lunch. It feels healthy and tastes good. Have to arrive a little earlier than 12 to avoid line ups. Also the avocado is extra money."}
{"text":"This place definitely knocks out its competitors in terms of toppings offered, quality, taste. The shop is run very efficiently given its small size.   It looks like the fish is cut fresh every day and come in nice portions. On some days they have special flavors which keeps things from getting old.  Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I am in love with Salmon Poke and this one really hits the spot. I was here for lunch today and the ingredients were super fresh and tasty.I got there around noon and luckily just beat the rush on a Tuesday. I ordered the regular box for $11.50 (the large is $15.00).  I chose the custom box and my hubby had the spicy box with crab salad, scallion, jalapeno, edamame, cucumber, citrus ponzu, spicy mayo, wasabi peas and crispy onions. Add the zucchini as a base and you will be glad that you did! he regular box isn't very big but they are very generous with their portions. This is a very small store with only about 6 bar stool seats. It's more of a take out place. It's very clean and bright but no washroom facility."}
{"text":"Good location and yummy poke bowls.   How I differentiate poke guys from the other poke places is that they offer ZUCCHINI NOODLES. It was my first- and it was magical. They also offer a really healthy grain option."}
{"text":"Ordered through Ritual just before noon on a Friday, definitely a great way to skip the line. Great portion of base, sauce, salmon, and salads, but could use a few more tuna chunks. Limited seating available, so take-out is highly recommended.  Service: Given that it was lunch time on a Friday, order took 15 minutes but that's reasonable. Order was ready for pick-up as I ordered through an app, pain-free experience. Customizations were also all done correctly (sauce separate, half zucchini noodles and half grain blend, seaweed salad instead of crab salad).  Food: Sauce was rich but a bit plain in flavour, and the grain blend was a bit too filling. It was similar to the purple rice served in Korean restaurants. Fish was definitely fresh, and zucchini noodles provided a refreshing balance to the bowl. Seaweed salad was good, would definitely recommend customizing the bowl to the way you like it!  Overall: Excellent serving that is relatively healthy for fast food, would come back if I'm ever in the area!"}
{"text":"I ordered the regular spicy box and it was amazing! I had it with the sushi rice but I definitely want to try the other base options. I paid $11.50 for the regular size and the portion was pretty good. Venue is small so it got crammed easily with everyone coming in to order lunch   It's definitely a place I would visit again!"}
{"text":"My overall experience at the poke box was amazing. From the customer service, fresh ingredients (especially that tuna from hawaii) and portions given in the boxes. It was busy, so it took a bit of time to order- however they apologized and tried to keep everyone entertained by pointing out the mini photo booth they had set up, or just simply engaging into conversations with customers."}
{"text":"Yes, I know.  I have a poke obsession.  Came stumbling to The Poke Box today with my friend as we were nearby. The store was clean and spacious. Please note that you order first before you pay.  We got the Poke Box (Tuna and Salmon) for $12.50 regular. The large size was $16.  The regular poke box was the size of a square roughly 20cm by 20cm lunch box. If you check in with yelp, you get free avocado toppings.   Seating is limited (there are only four seats on the side bar. This place is definitely recommended for takeout and not sit in. However, if you come during non busy hours, it's likely that you'll be able to sit down with your food.   The poke itself was okay, the fish were cut up into large pieces and they had lots of different toppings in them including seaweed salad, pineapple, crab meat, edamame beans, etc. However, for the cost of $12.50 for a box with a shallow amount of rice, I felt like other places in Toronto might have better deals for the same type of food. Customizing your bowl is also fairly easy to do.  Overall, the poke box is a good spot to enjoy your afternoon lunch meal."}
{"text":"For portion wise,  it is not worth the $15 price tag.  Flavour wise is just ok.  Service was a hit and miss, all on the same visit."}
{"text":"One of my main places to eat while working downtown. I usually get the custom box so I get exactly what I want. Great selection, fresh ingredients and decent portions. Its just a bit out of the way."}
{"text":"All poke joints should be amazingly fresh, have inspired sauces, and great house specialties.  Perfect Poke Box in a side street exceeds those high expectations.  I  recommend the tuna and salmon box for those who don't want too much spice (but you have spicy options with the toppings to boost the heat).  Or just go straight for the spicy box for fiery salmon.   Only four seats at a small bar in the wall, not usually room at lunch.  But just get takeout and nosh somewhere else. This place does not try to complicate things and be much more than straight up poke. FYI - there is one oddball option I do recommend - The zucchini noodles are a good choice for low carb substitute for your base, very filling and nutritious."}
{"text":"I came here on a recommendation from a friend.  I was a bit skeptical at first given its $15 price tag on a large box (I ordered the large Spicy Box).    Surprisingly the food was pretty good.  It felt like eating sushi but without the sea weed.  All the ingredients blended really well to make this a delicious meal.  I wouldn't necessarily come here everyday but I will definitely come back for sure.    There are no seatings so you have to eat at one of the PATH food courts or bring it back to your desk."}
{"text":"Tasted good when I tried it for the first time and the workers are very welcoming, but the price can better for what it's worth"}
{"text":"Awesome Poke place. My wife and I were a little hangry after laying around and missing breakfast on a Saturday afternoon and ended up here.  I chose the quintessential poke special with crab, tuna, seaweed on a bed of brown rice + edamame. So fresh and so good! All the fresh food is laid out at the counter. With Yelp check in as of July 2017, you got a free avocado add on which was appreciated. A large Poke Box is around $14-15CDN, but definitely a ton of food. My only qualm is I wish they put just a tad more of the raw fish protein in there. I found it just a tad out of balance, easily fixed by being a little extra generous with the fish.  Not a lot of seating here, definitely more of a whole in the wall, but delicious and recommended!"}
{"text":"Balanced meal with a great combination of ingredients. There is a decent lineup during lunch so i would recommend using ritual to order ahead and pick up. Would save you around 5-10 minutes!"}
{"text":"I had my eye on this place for a while, finally i got to try their \"The California Dreaming\" poke box, with crab, rice, fried onion, seaweed and more. It was very fresh and quite yummy, I would definitely keep this place in mind if I am in the area."}
{"text":"There seems to be more Poke joints in Toronto then Hawaii opening up these days.....and while they may start to feel redundant...I really enjoy healthy options for lunch and dinner.     If you think of The Poke Box as a health takeout joint with raw fish as a protein option, they are pretty good.     What do I want in a good meal?   - Fresh ingredients - Check - healthy ingredients - Check  - Options to change it up - Check  - Won't break the bank - Check  What did I like best?   If you like zucchini noodles (i love zucchini noodles), they go great with the roasted sesame dressing.   Otherwise, their sushi rice is cooked properly.   I never understood why anyone would want to eat raw kale....but there's a bunch of people that enjoy it, and that is an option.    There's also a smoked tofu vegetarian option that I didn't get to try, but that looks super tasty!    Their tuna and salmon pieces are cut up pretty small, but very uniform and spoon fork friendly (so you get a bit of everything for texture and flavour)...and they are heavy handed with their Tobiko....I love tobiko.  :-)    My favourite part?  Crushed wasabi peas and fried scallions as the crunchy bits in my meal.  :-)  I was pleasantly surprised with this.   I am going to make sure I add that into my salads from now on....it's okay if I steal some of the yummy ideas right?   With a regular box at 11.50 an a large box at 13.50 ....their prices are actually pretty decent.   I get a full meal without feeling lethargic afterwards.  Here's to a great poke joint....and I'll be back."}
{"text":"The Poke Box knows how to take Poke to the next level. Its better than any poke that I've had in NYC. Even though its a tiny hole in the wall, it gets packed during lunch time.  Don't forget to check in with Yelp to get free avocado. First, you can choose the size of your bowl, then you can choose the base. I had half rice and half zoodles. I've never seen zoodles offered at a poke place, its good if you are trying to lose weight like me. Then you can choose your protein. I had the tuna (which costs a little more). Then you can choose the sauce for your tuna. They offer a whole lot of toppings- furikake, crab salad, seaweed salad etc. All the toppings were delicious. They have a variety of sauces too- I decided to go with spicy mayo. I don't even live in Toronto but I need to come here more often for the poke box!"}
{"text":"5 stars for fresh fish. I've tried all the Toronto poke shops - Rolltation, Poke Guys, Pokito, Cali Love and PokeBox is definitely the superior in terms of quality of fish (I've had both the tuna and the salmon). Having a bowl here feels more like a homemade poke bowl rather than the commercial feeling you get at the other stores.   Also, shout out to the zucchini noodles that are a great alternative to those on a non carb diet. My friend tried the tofu bowl which was surprisingly really tasty, so I would also definitely recommend that to all the vegans out there."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of poke places that have popped up around the city, but none of them can compare to this place. The freshness of the ingredients is astounding (unlike other poke places that serve you overnight fish). This is one of the only places within the CBD where I can have a good meal and return back to the office feeling refreshed (no coffee needed after).   With the amount of office workers from all the nearby buildings ordering lunch (and dinner too), you know this place is the real deal.  They also keep inventing new styles and sauces with Poke of the Day. My usual is salmon or tuna with the sweet soy sauce, but now I religiously order Poke of the Day everytime I go. I highly encourage everyone to try that next time and let their staff fix you up an inspirational lunch!   I have yet to find a place that provides a better balance between fresh ingredients, portion size, nutritional value and price than The Poke Box; I hope you guys can open more locations around the city in the future so more people can have healthier lunches!"}
{"text":"Service was extremely fast and they were patient with my order. I went in and started ordering, but forgot to pick stuff for me to order as well, so I had to make up one on the spot. For those who were expecting something from the zucchini noodles, it is, quite literally, a grated zucchini.  There is very little seating in this place, so it is only a pick up your food n' eat elsewhere. The place is tucked on the west corner and inside was very clean.   Food was very fresh and pretty tasty. I liked how you are able to pick the food you want included in your dish and the selection was decent. Price-wise, it's on the high side as it brings me to the 70% full and it isn't that filling, so don't go there starving as you will probably need more. Then again, I really felt like I was eating a japanese salad with a spoon. I had the Salmon poke bowl.  Environment: 3.5 / 5 Service: 4 / 5 Food: 4.5 / 5 Price Point: 4 / 5"}
{"text":"I ordered the large Poke box for $16 and it is definitely enough for two meals. It is made with tropical slaw, seaweed salad, crab salad, cucumber, edamame, red onion, roasted sesame, ginger and furikake. The highlight of the poke box is the tuna and salmon sashimi. It is fresh and the portion of fish is perfect.  The best thing about this poke place is that you have a choice of which option to select as your base. You can pick sushi rice, grain blend, zucchini noodles, or salad. For people who are avoiding carbs, the zucchini noodles and salad are a great option.  The seaweed salad, tropical slaw and crab salad are perfect sides to the fish as they are not overly dressed and compliments the sashimi and base very well.  I normally order through ritual to avoid the lineup during lunch time, but the popularity of this poke box place is also high during dinner as there are many taking orders to go.  You can also customize your own bowl and they will charge by a base price (Regular $11.50 and Large $15.00). Depending on the ingredients you add, the price will increase or decrease. For example, if you pick Tuna as your protein, the cost of the bowl will go up by $2, but if you pick tofu or crab, the cost of the bowl will decrease by $1."}
{"text":"I discovered the Poke Box after yelping.  It is very small and it is in a small street. You normally wont pass by this street unless you work nearby. It is east of Yonge so it's not as busy.   My first impression was that it was a take out place. There are no tables. It's just the counter where they make your food and they have a few bar seats.  I came during lunch hour and there was quite a few people there.   I built my own box with half salad and half grain mix. It is just like any other poke bowls I had. Nothing stood out. They have fresh fish. The servers are friendly and efficient. A solid place if you work nearby and want a poke bowl. Will return here whenever I want a poke bowl in this area :)"}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews about lunch places but damn this is good! The food is so fresh and yummy! It's a bit pricey compared to other healthy joints like freshii and b.good but totally worth it. The portions are quite large too and I usually can't finish the whole thing. My favourite is spicy signature box... yum!"}
{"text":"Mmmm we are visiting Toronto from Washington, DC and found this place via Yelp. Super yum food, super fresh, and super filling. Definitely will return if we're back here!"}
{"text":"Actually one of the best poke places I've been to I guess what stands out for me is the zucchini noodles, however it's really not that hard to make!   Small place on Toronto st. Near Rosewater if you're accustomed to the place on the Thursdays.   Generally a nice place to grab your lunch. The have four chairs that would be good for sit on if you decide. It's more of a take out place.   Tofu - it was roughly $11 and if you check in you get avocado as well!! .   My friend got a salmon/tuna bowl and it was pretty good as well  Overall, i found the place pretty average like all the other poke bowl/healthy bowl places except they had a zucchini spiral tool which enabled them to make \"zoodles\".   I would recommend going if you have nowhere else to go around; but definitely better places and better for the price nearby."}
{"text":"Came here around 6:30pm on their grand opening.  Thought there would be a bigger lineup but because of the rain only about 6 people were ahead of me.  Took around 10 mins until it was my turn to order which is enough time I needed to figure out a game plan for my custom poke box. I picked zucchini noodles as base, salmon as protein, seaweed & crab salad, red onions & jalapeno & corn as mix in colour, wasabi & unagi as sauce, nori & furikake & fried onion as toppings.  I enjoyed the box very much and every bite was a different yet tasty experience. I never had zucchini noodles before and its definitely something I will try again. Regular size is $11.50 and large is $13.50 but for their grand opening they had a 50% off deal.  They only were offering the regular box for sale and portion size would be something I'd get if I wanted a small light meal.  I'd recommend getting the large as its $2 more and looked about 60% bigger in size.  Also they ran out of a few items so go earlier if there is some ingredient you must try.  If you like taking selfies they have some poke box related props to add to your selfie pictures."}
{"text":"It wasn't my favorite poke place out of the other ones in Toronto. However they do have a great variety in one box. I was surprised to find pineapple and melon in my poke box, fruit isn't my favorite in these dishes however it was an interesting mix. A regular preset box is about $15 including tax."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but disappointed for wrong order (or my bad for not checking my Ritual order before leaving).   Ordered the Poke Signature (the most expensive one!) which should have Tuna, salmon, tropical slaw, seaweed salad, crab salad, cucumber, edamame, red onion, roasted sesame sauce, ginger, furikake - there was no Tuna nor tropical slaw (I'm not sure if there was cucumber & ginger either). It was replaced with pineapple instead, which was actually pretty good with the grains blend (purple rice(?)). Salmon was a good size - fairly large chunks. Added nori which was just a few shreds, barely noticeable.  For the base, I enjoyed the half grains blend and half zucchini noodles. Regular size portion is just right, not as big as other healthy box places I've tried.  I would've stayed to eat there but it seems more of a grab-and-go place and people/employees were just chillin near the seats area."}
{"text":"Picked up a California Unrolled via mealpal. It was HALF the usual order. Even the avocado scoop was smaller. Disappointed"}
{"text":"There is a lot to be said here, so I will try to keep it as short as possible.   I came here on opening day within 5 minutes of opening at 11am. It took me a total of 25 minutes to get in and out - and there were only 4 people ahead of me. Given that nothing here needs to be cooked, this was disappointing.   1. They should have enforced the pre-ordering for build your own box. I saw some slips of paper where you can pre-select your items for build your own box so you're not spending 5 minutes at the counter selecting your items and holding up the line.  2. Staff were not informed of what ingredients go inside the signature boxes. My friend and I both ordered signature boxes (Poke and Spicy) and he still had to ask someone what goes inside of it or what base we can have etc.  3. The sushi rice was not cooked well. It was clumpy and soggy in some parts and hard in others.   4. The bowl that was used to mix up the ingredients was wet and had water droplets inside.   5. The menu only lists one price but there were two sizes of boxes you can get (regular and large). We had to ask how much the large was and we were told $3, although I seen others on here say it was only $2. What is it?  The food itself was good, but the overall experience wasn't nice. Hopefully it was because they had a promo running and it was overly busy and it won't be this bad in the future."}
{"text":"Delicious go to place for poke in this area! There isn't much seating though - it's mostly for takeout but if you're lucky there might be a few seats along the wall that you might be able to get! lots of different options - taste is pretty good - i quite enjoyed my salmon bowl :) I got it with the zucchini noodles and it's definitely an interesting twist!"}
{"text":"I stopped in after work for lunch and boy was I impressed. I had a regular tuna on sushi rice with the standard toppings. I swear out of all the places I've had poke in Toronto, nothing beats this spot. There's great textures, temperatures and vibrancy in every bite. Well rounded acidity with the ponzu sauce that cuts through the fattiness of the tuna and avocado. Amazing, perfectly done edamame contrasted well with a supple bite of the crispy onions, tobiko and wakame. Jalapeno coins gave a really nice heat to it all, and although the seeds were in, the spice wasn't overbearing. Nothing was overpowering and what I really appreciated was that you could taste the tuna. It was fresh and lacked a fishy flavour that older fish would usually have. The place is well decorated, although not too much seating available. Staff was hospitable and friendly. Fantastic place overall"}
{"text":"Probably my favourite poke in the city. It's fresh, clean, and the people are always friendly. I always get a custom bowl and I like how their system works. Plus, if you're dining in, you can ask for more toppings if needed."}
{"text":"If I had to choose one meal to eat for the rest of my life, it would be the salmon poke salad from The Poke Box.  So refreshing and so colorful, it makes me feel like I'm eating an entire meal of superfoods.  One of their signature boxes is actually called Super Food, but I like to do the BYOB (Build Your Own Box) option include all my favorite veggies.  My BYOB box of choice includes: - Zucchini noodles.  These were so amazing that I went out and bought my own spiralizer to make zucchini noodles at home, much to my husband's chagrin.  Much more to his chagrin is that I occasionally call them zoodles just to mess with him.   - Salmon - Seaweed salad - Crab salad - Cucumber  - Corn - Kale - Sweet Garlic Soy - Avocado!   This place is very small, so it's more of an order and take your lunch to go type of place.  Also, there are stairs to climb in front of the entrance, so it's not stroller or wheelchair accessible.   P.S. At the time this review was written, I got a free scoop of avocado every time I checked in on Yelp.  Score!"}
{"text":"First poke box from poke box! I've been here twice and have enjoyed my meal each time :) quite filling for a regular size box but I can finish the large without a problem either - it's very flavourful and delicious! Fresh ingredients  and you can get creative by building your own box! I've built my own box the two times I've been here, which I liked better than the options on the menu. I liked that they offered zucchini noodles, which is delicious by the way if you do half zoodles and half sushi rice! Staff were very friendly and patient. Lines weren't long at all the two times I went, which was just before noon. Only downside would be it is quite pricy, almost $12 with tax for a regular and around $16 for large. But bear in mind it is quite filling!"}
{"text":"First time trying poke bowls (box?)!   Came here for a late lunch, was served quickly and well by the friendly staff. Lost a star because the quantity just really didn't match up with the pricing for me, but it is *almost* worth it!!   Got a regular size super food box ($13 incl. tax) that didn't look like much but filled me up okay (recently have been trying not to over-eat though). Salmon was fresh, and I got a good amount of fish roe - yum! All the other toppings were just a tablespoonful, no more.   Willing to come back when I feel like splurging on super foods again :)"}
{"text":"I dropped by The Poke Box for a quick lunch and was pleasantly surprised! I decided to make my own bowl with spicy salmon, and I liked that I was able to customize the bowl to my liking. The fish was fresh and the toppings were plentiful and delicious. The servers were very friendly and generous with the various toppings. I found it to be bit pricey for lunch, but given the location, the huge portion size, and the quality of ingredients, I was happy with the value! I'll definitely be back when I'm craving poke, and to check out their interesting daily specials!"}
{"text":"They have the classic boxes (pre set combo), make your own box, and the daily special. Price is your average Poke price - I never finished an entire Poke box so you do get a good amount.   TPB has brown rice, which makes up for the fatty, delicious sauce they drizzle on top. I also like how their avocado is not in slices (if you get it as a side), instead, they are already mashed, and scooped into your bowl. I prefer mashed avocado a lot more, just because it's creamier, and less work for me when I eat.   People who work here are nice and patient even though the place is congested during lunch. The line moves pretty quickly too. It's definetly my favourite poke place in Toronto so far!!"}
{"text":"Definitely my go to spot for poke in toronto.  The lines are usually long around lunch time but they go quick. I usually create my own bowl with salmon and avocado and it's always fantastic. Compared to other poke places, the give more protein and pack the box to the brim.  The tuna option is fresh as well and you won't go wrong with either.  Price point is pretty average for poke. 4/5 price  5/5 for food and quality"}
{"text":"The Poke Box has a minimalist and very clean feeling to it. There is not much seating, essentially only a bar with 3-4 seats. But everyone seems to take it back to their office.   The employees are friendly and tried engage their customers, which is nice. The service is pretty fast even though they marinate/mix the poke/salmon to order. It has an \"artisanal\" feel compared to other poke spots.   I ordered the spicy box, which was fairly tasty but felt that there was too much sriracha mayo.  Pricing is similar to other poke places (a regular/small is $11.5 before tax) but is smaller than other places, probably because they're located in the financial district. The small also comes in a tiny box, which made it a bit more difficult to eat. I suppose they would have to change their name if they served it in a bowl."}
{"text":"This place definitely become my favorite place to get lunch!! It's fresh and make you feel healthy! A little bit pricey but the portion is big enough to share... Definitely will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Best poke in the city. Unlike a lot of other poke takeout spots I've been to, these guys know how to make a great tasting poke bowl. Sauces and ingredients seem to work well together."}
{"text":"I received an offer on Ritual to try this so decided I would. I'm so glad I did but if I ate this regularly I would run out of money!  I opted for a large Signature Spicy Box which was delicious. Instead of sushi rice, I had the zucchini noodles which were very refreshing with the ingredients. The salmon was fresh and the portion was filling.   It wasn't too busy when I arrived right at noon but there were at least a dozen other boxes for ritual orders so they were going to get busy soon.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious, my fellow Yelpers. I've ordered the spicy salmon box and on both occasions I've been completely satisfied.  Heads up: it's a zoo between 12 noon - 1 PM. I ordered once using Ritual and it wasn't ready when I got there - but it was understandably very busy.  Portion sizes are good and it's on the pricey side - but you get a good quality meal in a square box.  My first time trying poke and thanks to The Poke Box it won't be the last."}
{"text":"This was my first Poke experience, and it was pretty fine. I decided to uber eats something light, healthy and satisfying. The Poke Box seemed like a tasty alternative to sushi, and it was. I ordered their Maui box, and upgraded the size and got an extra portion of Tuna, because why not treat yourself? All said and done, the food was delicious, it was fresh, flavourful and seems like it hit the nail on the head as far as Poke goes."}
{"text":"Looove the poke served at this place, especially with the free avocado topping you get from the yelp check in offer.   I built my own regular sized poke box which was surprisingly quite large and filling. You get to choose two sides, three toppings, and unlimited sauces/extras. For the sides, I tried the seaweed salad and the crab salad - the seaweed salad portion was huge and flavourful while the crab salad tasted like imitation crab and quite underdressed. Definitely trying the tropical salad (seems to be a mix of mango and pineapple) next time.   TIP #1: If you're thinking of getting the spicy salmon box, build your own box instead. They're both the same price ($11.50), but you get 1 extra side with the build your own box and can even build it with all the customizations that come with the spicy salmon.   TIP #2: The line moves fast! I came at 12:30 on a weekday (prime lunch time in the financial district) and there was AT LEAST 20 people in front of me. Keeping that in mind, I was still able to place my order and pay within 20 minutes of getting there, which works out to be 1 minute/person due to their highly organized assembly line structure.   Overall, this is the place to be if you're craving poke. I love the fresh ingredients and large portion sizes, and appreciate how I can customize my poke on a variety of bases (purple rice all the way!!)"}
{"text":"I come here every week! It's my go to place for healthy meals as I always choose their grain or zucchini noodle for the base!  Their ingredients are always fresh; and have a variety of toppings to choose from.   It's decently priced, considering the big portion!  Service is prompt."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It is my go-to for a treat.  Unlike other poke places, I love that they offer zucchini noodles instead of rice.  I always get the regular Spicy Box and I order through Ritual.  It's quite filling.  The staff that work there are also very sweet."}
{"text":"Oh boy this place, the food, the service was amazing! I had the spicy Salmon Poke Box and my girlfriend had the regular Salmon Poke Box. From presentation to taste everything was very well put together, colourful, and artistic.  Conveniently located and with a great modern outlook, will definitely recommend it to anyone who visits downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"One of the best poke bowl I've ever had! The fish was very fresh. The price is very reasonable for the amount. The location is clean and the staff were helpful."}
{"text":"This is my second visit after last happy experience.   I decided to build my own Poke box.   Base: half blend grain, half zucchini (thanks Yelpers' advice to try the zucchini noodles.) Protein: tuna +$2,  Sides: crabmeat salad, seaweed,  Mix in color: corn, kale, beetroot,  Sauce it: roasted sesame,  Top it: everything.  Add: one scoop of avocado for free from Yelp check-in.   It costs $13.5 + tax Regular size looks small but actually quite filling. Ingredients were very fresh and all favours mixed well together. I wish it's cheaper but at least it is a filling, healthy meal in Toronto downtown."}
{"text":"The Poke Box is arguably one of the best Californian style poke spots in the city. Despite having a slightly higher price point, the assortment, freshness and quality of their ingredients are notches above their competitors. Even from their base options alone, the grain blend is a legit mix of black, brown and red rice, and there are zucchini noodles for the carb-averse. The boxes seem small at first but are densely packed and filling. My favourite is The Poke Box (~$12), which has three proteins in it.  Recently, they catered a poke party for my office and did a fantastic job. The different boxes were well organized and they even made handwritten colour coded menus."}
{"text":"Great fresh food. Tuna is amazing! The check in offer for free avocado topping is a nice touch."}
{"text":"A lot of the glowing reviews for this joint must come from their friends because I certainly do not feel this place deserves the hype. I came during their grand opening when they had their 2 for 1 box. The catch is that you need to have 2 people physically present in order to buy 2 boxes, that's was the most stupid rule I've heard. No place to sit and eat, service is slow and inefficient.  Anyway let me get to the poke. I ordered their classic Poke box with brown rice. Their tuna and salmon was not even marinated like other poke joints, it was just plain sashimi. They used an ice cream scooper the size of a teaspoon and scooped one serving of each, drenched it with some white sauce, mixed it and proceed to add the other sides. You don't get to pick your sauce unless you create your own bowl. By the time I brought it home the rice was lumpy. Taste wise nothing special.  The regular size they served on that day could not even satisfy a child. Hopefully that is not their standard size because that would be a major rip off for the price they charge. My colleague also tried this place and felt it was underwhelming.   If you are in the downtown area there are a lot of poke shops that popped up recently that offer a way bigger bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I'm here too often...  Yup, this is my favourite go-to poke place, and yes, I've eaten other poke places in Toronto. Only one that is comparable is Rolltation but I found Rolltation just a bit too sweet.  Spicy box is always the way to go. You can ask for extra sauce on the side (mine is citrus ponzu). This is also available on Ritual! So convenient. Shameless plug lol...get $10 off on Ritual with my code: http://invite.ritual.co/LUCY4101   No much a dine-in place, so gotta take it back to the office or a nearby food court to eat. You can choose to have half zucchini noodles and half rice."}
{"text":"This quick takeout poke is delicious! I go at least once a week. I've have poke many places but this one is the best. They tend to go heavy on the dressing so you might want to ask for light (even though it's very good)"}
{"text":"The new fad? Poke bowls have blown up all over Toronto and I love love love it!  Some who loves sashimi and flavours and for whatever reason dislike seaweed, poke is for me!    At The Poke Box they let you customize your box or choose your own variations of ingredients--which you can pick what you want and items to leave at the Poke bar.  Yesterday evening I decided on a healthier option for dinner as I was working late.  Walked in, greeted with a smile and took a while to choose what I wanted but they did not once rushed me but let me take my time . I decided on The Poke Box, large, half sushi rice half spring mix; a scoop of extra salmon ($2 extra); everything but sweet onions and green onions!   Great service, great food---working a 15 hour day wasn't sooo bad  it is a bit pricy as my box came up to $18 but it is nice to splurge!"}
{"text":"I like having the choice to pick my own sauce that I like to mix my fish with! Portions are good and staff are nice! Little hard to navigate to but I will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place because of its simplicity, and it stays pretty basic (good thing) with its ingredients.  I'm not a big fan of adding all kind of fruits and nuts to my poke, but I think I would like if they had more seafood options.    The employees were very nice, the last time I went they had run out of their special of the day but he whipped me up something very similar.    There are a few things to work out, I'd like to see them have some pre-marinated seafood too, hawaiian style."}
{"text":"I visited Toronto recently and decided to try out a poke place downtown with good reviews.  The Poke Box was decent, but nothing spectacular. They gave a good quantity of food (I couldn't even finish the regular size) but I didn't care for some of the add-ins. I ordered the Spicy Box, and mom had the (namesake) Poke Box. I found the seaweed salad too flavorful, and I generally never like imitation crab meat. Mom was thoroughly unimpressed (it was also her first time trying poke). I did enjoy the sauces they used, as well as the crispy onions. Overall, the flavors were a bit too overpowering.  Service was quick and the servers were very friendly. They were very willing to recommend additional ingredients to add.  The storefront is a little difficult to access if you aren't using GPS (pretty much our situation). We thought the place didn't exist until we happened to look down the small street the store is located on. The store itself is pretty cramped, and there is only a small bench indoors with a few tall stools. It seemed to be more of a takeout place.  A decent experience with decent poke. If I visit Toronto again, I probably won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"I don't really like the box container, which I find complicated to eat in since the ingredients are a bit jammed. But the ingredients themselves are good quality, and the portions are generous... except for the fish ! And this is my biggest con for this place, just a bit more fish and it would be great. Although I like the fish more marinated and cut into bigger pieces.  All in all, it's still a good meal and I'm tempted to come back again try another bowl... sorry box ! (btw Debit cards aren't accepted, which is weird to me)"}
{"text":"The Poke Box's poke is the 4th poke I ever ate, so I am not really an expert. But I enjoyed what I ordered.   As a spicy lover, I of course opt for their Spicy Box ($11.90). I was hoping that I could try some Zucchini Noodle finally and be healthy but sadly they were all out at 2 pm!! So I just loaded up on my favourite Sushi Rice!  Check in using Yelp App scored me a free avocado topping! (+0.5 star)"}
{"text":"A nice little poke place that serves decent poke. The ingredients were fresh, fish was nice and tasty. Portion sizes were great but the only complaint is that it was not as flavourful as other places. I had only realized that there was not enough sauce (soy or unagi) so the rice was a bit plain. I did try to check in but they ran out of avocado for the day, no biggie though."}
{"text":"Hands down the best poke in the city !!!!! Zucchini noodles are amazing!!! The daily specials are bomb!!More of a take out place but this is in the financial district and I work across the street most of us just grab our food and eat in the office so it's normal and works but totally worth the trip and there is minimal seating but there is seating it's a new place and when they first opened they were cash only so I hope in the future they get a little more seating but regardless even if it didn't have one bar stool I would still come here and recommend it the food is amazing and leaves you craving it in the middle of the night !!!"}
{"text":"Poke. The lunch box sushi combination of choice for hipsters everywhere. Let's get down to it:  Pros: + good selection of choices in boxes.  + big variety of toppings for your box.  + fish is really good.  + layout is nice and clean.   Cons: - sushi rice is too dry for my taste. That's a deal breaker.  - only 3 types of fish available.   That's it! Overall not bad, but the rice is dry and that hurts my feelings."}
{"text":"YELP TIP: check-in for a free avocado add-on!!  I absolutely LOVE poke so this place has been on my radar to try for a while. I do want to mention that I love fruit in my poke, but the options here are practically non-existent. But man, Poke Box truly does nail the savoury poke flavours though!  I got the Spicy Salmon Box with a rice base to-go. There were lots of seaweed salad and it had the best crab meat salad I've ever had (actually tasted & felt like crab, unlike the other artificial stuff). The entire poke bowl wasn't overdressed, the sushi rice was on the chewier & firmer side, and the fried onions was an awesome touch.  Definitely coming back to try their zucchini noodle base!!"}
{"text":"Please not that this review is based on a mealpal order. I got the crab poke box, it was just alright. The place was super busy so maybe other boxes were better."}
{"text":"The poke box has been my absolute favourite since the day they opened (and I've been dozens of times since!!). The quality is incredible, so fresh and delicious every time. Plus, the staff is SUPER friendly, and will give you recommendations and let you try things so you can ensure that whatever you choose is right for you."}
{"text":"Delicious food with many healthy options to choose from. Better for take out as seating is quite limited. One of my favourite meals when I'm in the area."}
