{"text":"Wonderful breakfast spot.
We tried this place once, and have been coming back almost every weekend since.

The food is great - tasty, home-style, generous portions, beautifully presented.
I've had the poached pear and pecan crepe, and many of the omelettes.
Great choice of sweet and savoury dishes. And an equally great choice of more traditional egg-meat-toast plates. Some health options as well.
Everything is served with toast and their home-made jams and spreads.

The service is great. The staff seems to be steadily the same people, and they're all very sweet and efficient.
The owner is also the cook, and she often comes out of the kitchen to talk to regulars.
The one small problem with service is they tend to sit groups of two at tables for four, which is very welcome on slow days, but probably not the best strategy when they get a line outside on weekend mornings...

The setting is also very quaint. Very home-y, with lots of old-time trinkets and home-made and fine foods on shelves everywhere."}

{"text":"Went for a family members' birthday brunch.
Unlike other cookie cutter brunch places this one had a lot of authenticity to it - from the decore to the atmosphere to the menu.

 I consider how a restaurant prepares eggs Florentine to be ultimate test, so that's what I ordered along with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice and cappuccino.

The florentine was probably the freshest tasting I've ever had and the eggs were cooked to perfection.

Everyone at the table was very satisfied with their meals and we would definitely go back again. 

The staff was very friendly and accommodating to my two-year-old as well as the rest of my family.

Now for the almost trivial negatives.
As with every brunch place there is standing room near the entrance whenever the place is full. The problem was the entrance was literally 3' x 6' and there were 10 people trying to find their own space while allowing exiting customers to pass.

Lastly (and that should be written in brunch commandments) never assume a customer wants cinnamon powder on their cappuccino as opposed to chocolate, always ask"}
{"text":"A cute little brunch place nestled deep inside Vaudreuil and the only brunch place close enough for Ile Perrot-ers (I think) which deserves a plus but this is still an overpriced joint with very average food. The unique location for Montreal outskirt dwellers is its only plus."}
{"text":"Beau petit restaurant à déjeuner.  
Décoration vieillotte et jolie.
Le cafe est d'excellente qualité contrairement aux autres restaurants à déjeuners. 
Le bagel au saumon fumé était bon et généreux en saumon. La crêpe bretonne aux pommes aussi etait pleine de garniture et servie très chaude. Ma seule déception est la portion de fruits qui accompagne chaque assiette. Une tranche d'orange, de pamplemousse et un petit quartier d'ananas. Le service est impeccable."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in the area. It's a small restaurant on the outskirts of Vaudreuil and St-Lazare which is kind of hidden but it still manages to get extremely busy. It can get a bit crammed during the peak hours but I feel like it's well deserved because the food is high quality. They have organic and gluten free options. And they sell their own jams and foods such as pies which you can take home."}
{"text":"LA meilleure place à déjeuner. Des plats frais, bon à des prix raisonnables. Le café est excellent, ce qui est rare dans les places à déjeuner-dîner. Les patates et les confitures maison sont aussi délicieuses. Une petite place qui saura vous charmez."}
{"text":"Déjeuner/brunch dans un cadre style intérieur vieille maison canadienne ! 

Beaucoup de choix pour le déjeuner/brunch sur leur menu. Foyer au bois qui rajoute de la chaleur + déco & ambiance, vieillotte maison canadienne. Prix & service corrects. Mon déjeuner royal (1/2 gaufre + 2 oeufs/bacon/patates/creton/pains 14,75$) était bon mais sans wow. Apparemment, un des meilleurs restos pour déjeuners/brunchs dans Vaudreuil-Soulanges, pour ma copine & moi, c'était ok.
