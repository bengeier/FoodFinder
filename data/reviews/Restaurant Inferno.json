{"text":"Un de mes restaurants préféré!! Le menu change aux deux semaines, c'est toujours un vrai délice!!  Il y a toujours de l'ambiance et le staff est extremement sympatique! Bon choix de vin aussi!"}
{"text":"Belle découverte, par contre un peu bruyant."}
{"text":"Pour notre premier MTL à Table de 2016, nous avons opté pour le restaurant Inferno et je peux vous dire que c'était le meilleur choix.   Si vous avez un seul resto à faire durant les deux prochaines semaines, c'est ici que ça se passe.  Des entrées fraîches et chaudes sont servies. Les champignons et la polenta sont renversants et la salade avec son côté acidulée et sucrée se complémentent à la perfection.   Les repas principaux ont été pour notre part de la joue de boeuf et le risotto aux betteraves. Le risotto et sa couleur rosée vous surprend mais le goût est tellement réconfortant. La joue est tendre et parfaite.   La carte des vins est aussi très généreuse et vous donne beaucoup de choix tant à la bouteille qu'au verre. Le service est impeccable et les serveurs toujours présents.  Le Restaurant Inferno est LE resto de MTL à Table 2016!!"}
{"text":"Really lovely restaurant! It's small but the food is really well prepared. My risotto was perfect... the rice a soft on the outside with a little crunch in the middle, simply perfect. The entree are really interesting including the zucchini flowers and the salumi platter."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a restaurant for a romantic dinner for two or a birthday celebration with friends...then I strongly recommend Inferno located in Little Italy. The interior of the restaurant is simply beautiful...wooden decor and dim lighting is stunning. Once you settle into the resto , you will be warmly greeted and experience excellent service. Then comes the food which is amazing...beautifully presented dishes  packed with such great Mouth-watering flavors. What is unique about this resto is that their menu changes every 2 weeks...which will keep you coming back for more tasting of great dishes!  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I loved every bite at Inferno!  It is so refreshing to have homemade pasta and sauce in Little Italy again.  The crab stuffed squash flowers are amazing.  The osso bucco tasted better than my grandmother's (but don't tell her I said so.)  I loved the mix of real Italian food with inspired, yet simple dishes like lobster rolls.  The seasoning was perfect; they were even better than the ones I've had in Maine.  Also, the cafe next door has the best lattes I've ever been served.  I suggest sipping a latte on the sidewalk before heading to Inferno for a great meal.  It's obvious the chefs care about the food they serve.  If you consider yourself a \"foodie,\" eat here before everyone finds out about it and you need a reservation."}
{"text":"Incredible disappointment. I went here on my last night in Montreal based on its proximity to where I was staying, a recommendation from Fodor's, and the fact that Pizzeria Napoletano only takes cash. Unfortunately, it was not the last meal I had envisioned on my vacation.  The atmosphere of this place is nice, I will give it that. It's small, intimate, and in decent weather, they open it up to the outside.  Service, however, was a bit inattentive. I had to ask for more water, and I also had to exchange a plate with another place setting myself because the one in front of me was dirty.  Further, and most importantly, the food was overpriced and mediocre. My salad, which was a small plate (smaller than a typical side salad) of vegetables and cheese drizzled with an olive oil vinaigrette, was originally $16, but they knocked $3 off because they had run out of burrata mozzarella and had to substitute ricotta. It was decent, but it was just vegetables. My dining companion's risotto, on the other hand, had to be sent back because it came out rock hard undercooked. However, even to do that, it took effort to flag down someone because all of the wait staff was having a conversation and couldn't be bothered to attend to the two parties of customers in the restaurant. The menu was very limited too, and for an Italian restaurant, there was a serious lack of anything resembling pasta.  I wouldn't come back here, and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone either."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés avec un ami italien et avons tous les 3 apprécié notre soirée.  Plats savoureux. Ambiance chaleureuse et décontractée.   Situé dans la Petite Italie, il tient tête à certains voisins réputés."}
{"text":"My wife and I shared three appetizers and an entree.  We had the antipasti, oysters Rockefeller and tuna tartar.  Shared the entree of Cavatelli pasta with oxtail ragout.  Everything was outstanding - the service, the food and the atmosphere.  Would go back in a heartbeat.  We are from the US so it will be a while before we return."}
{"text":"I came here on a double date on a Saturday night. Our friend wanted to come here because we couldn't get reservations elsewhere at a decent hour and her and her husband always go to this resto because it is close-by and she said they did her engagement party there. She said sometimes they get free wine. I've never been before so I didn't mind trying it out and honestly I was hoping for free wine lol. In the end we did get a free grappa shot. ;) The owner was really nice and friendly. However, it took way too long to get our food!! We arrived at 8:30 and only ordered a main which took over an hour! I was so hungry. I found the menu to be a bit limited. I thought it was an Italian resto but the menu wasn't very Italian. My boyfriend and I as well as our friend's husband had the chicken confit and ribs. I've only ever had duck confit and although the texture was the same the taste was not. It was cooked to perfection but it was so bland. It would have been perfect if there was some salt on there. The ribs were amazing though. They fell off the bone and were so big and flavourful and fatty! Mmmm. It came with a side of potato salad but I wasn't a big fan because there were so many slices of raw onions. It had potential. I don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am very open-minded and that I am not easily offended. Also keep in mind that I always try to be constructive when I review a restaurant.  So I went to Inferno a few times. The food is hit or miss: sometimes delicious and other times, the blend of flavours is off. Also, in the past year, I have had the food of Inferno at two benefit suppers that were held in a hall and at a golf club. Both times, I very much disliked what they served... Especially the quid ink pasta... The fish flavour was so strong and off-putting that no one at our table of 12 had more than a bite... And that is saying a lot when you paid your ticket 500$/person.  However, my problem with Inferno is not actually the food, but the chef/owner of Inferno. I have rarely met a person so rude and offensive. When I was with a group of friends and we told him one person in the group did not eat pork, he made very racist comments to his staff about her. We overheard but did not leave as we did not want to ruin our friend's special day, but that is totally unacceptable and uncalled for.  Furthermore, the chef wears a t-shirt in his restaurant that has a woman kneeling naked in a bathroom stall performing --- on a man sitting on a toilet. Need I say more? Being eccentric is ok, but being vulgar and so crude in what is supposed to be a gourmet restaurant is unexplainable.   If you take a look at the Instagram pictures of the restaurant, you will immediately be convinced to never set foot in his restaurant or of any restaurants that condone this sexist, racist, vulgar and rude behaviour.  You might consider crossing the street for a delicious meal at Lucca's instead of bringing your money in this place."}
